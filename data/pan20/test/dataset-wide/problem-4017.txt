A II$_1$-factor is algebraically simple, so each morphism of II$_1$-factors is either injective or zero. Thus every non-zero morphism is an isomorphism onto its image. So $\phi: M \to \phi(M)$ is an isomorphism that takes $\phi^{-1}(N')$ to $N'$. I don't think the canonical surjection $G\to G'=G/\ker(f)$ actually gives you a map of factors $M\rtimes G\to M\rtimes G'$. In particular, if we denote the implementing unitaries as $u_g$ for $g\in G$, the map $u_g\mapsto u_{g\ker(f)}$ does not extend to a non-zero map of II$_1$-factors if $\ker(f)$ is non-trivial. The element $u_g-u_{g'}$ would map to zero if $g,g'\in \ker(f)$, and a non-trivial map of II$_1$-factors must be injective. 

The answer to the second part is also no. That is, $aa^*+bb^*$ could be zero for nonzero $a$ and $b$. Look at the $*$-algebra $\mathbb{C}^2$ with component-wise addition and multiplcation and $*$ given by $(x,y)^* = (\overline{y},\overline{x})$. It's straightforward to calculate that anything of the form $aa^*$ will look like $(z,\overline{z})$ for some $z\in\mathbb{C}$. Conversely, $(z,\overline{z})=(z,1)(z,1)^*$. We see $(z,\overline{z})$ and $(w,\overline{w})$ sum to $(z+w, \overline{z+w})$, so $aa^*+bb^*$ is still of the form $cc^*$. But taking $w=-z$ gives a sum of zero. 

Now I feel shy because there are some people watching that really know what they are talking about, unlike me. So a word of warning: anything I am going to write here may be too optimistic (or stupid). It is certainly extremely vague. With that said, the point of view I refer to is: consider the domain of f as a Riemann surface over the target. By this I mean that you can reconstruct dom(f) by patching pieces of the target using f to understand how to glue things. A the level of critical point, you have to remove the critical value and add several copies of the pieces that you may have to cut. This is already idealistic since there are also asymptotic values (points whose preimage is "at infinity", more rigorously, points $a$ in the range such that there is a path in the domain tending to the boundary of dom(f) and whose image by f tends to $a$). The prototype of the latter is the point 0 in the range of f=the exponential map, where a preimage of a neighborhood of 0 is an infinite cover over a punctured disk. But it may be less nice. Some more heuristics: the infinity of C is small, the infinity of D is big. In fact, you can recompose D by patching many copies of a single compact patch, exponentially many as you wander off to the boundary of D, if you count the distance by how many patches you need to cross. Archetypical examples: 

I believe (1 and 2) and (3) are mutually exclusive. Here is a proof: First, the commensurator $$ Comm_G(H) = \{g\in G : |\mathcal{O} _{gH}|, |\mathcal{O} _{g^{-1}H}|<\infty\} $$ is a group. We will show: 

Since you are looking for restrictions on quantum dimensions of objects in unitary fusion categories, you also want your cyclotomic integers to be totally real, as they are Frobenius-Perron eigenvalues of finite graphs. The recent article of Calegari-Guo $URL$ (see Proposition 4.3 in particular) extends the results in the Calegari-Morrison-Snyder article referenced above by @David Speyer. 

Probably what you really want is the fusion graph $\Gamma_X$ with respect to your simple object $X$. It is a directed graph with vertices labelled by the simple objects of your category. Between the vertices labelled by simples $Y$ and $Z$, there are $N^{Y,X}_Z=\operatorname{dim}(\operatorname{Hom}(Y\otimes X, Z))$ directed edges from $Y$ to $Z$. The fusion graph with respect to $X^*$ is obtained by reversing the orientation of all the edges, since by semisimplicity and Frobenius reciprocity, $$ N^{Y,X}_Z = \operatorname{dim}(\operatorname{Hom}(Y\otimes X, Z)) = \operatorname{dim}(\operatorname{Hom}(Y, Z\otimes X^*)) = \operatorname{dim}(\operatorname{Hom}(Z\otimes X^*, Y)) = N^{Y,X^*}_Z. $$ This means that if $X$ is self-dual, then you can view this graph as unoriented. In your question you've referred to a pair of unoriented graphs. These would arise if you were looking at the principal graphs of a subfactor. Given a finite index subfactor $A\subset B$, we have the semisimple tensor category of $A-A$ bimodules generated by $B$. The simples are obtained by decomposing the tensor powers $\bigotimes_A^n B$ into irreducibles. We can also view $\bigotimes_A^n B$ as an $A-B$ bimodule and decompose into irreducibles. This gives the semisimple module category of $A-B$ bimodules. Similarly, we have a tensor category of $B-B$ bimodules and a module category of $B-A$ bimodules. We get the principal graphs $(\Gamma_+,\Gamma_-)$ as follows. The graph $\Gamma_+$ has even vertices the simple $A-A$ bimodules and odd vertices the simple $A-B$ bimodules. There are then $\operatorname{dim}(\operatorname{Hom}_{A-B}(Y\otimes_A B, Z))$ edges between the simple $A-A$ bimodule $Y$ and the simple $A-B$ bimodule $Z$. The dual principal graph $\Gamma_-$ is defined analogously with $B-B$ and $B-A$ bimodules. Edit after the comments: Given a unitary fusion category $\mathcal{C}$ and an object $X\in\mathcal{C}$, you can construct a subfactor standard invariant $\mathcal{P}_\bullet$ from which you can get a pair of principal graphs $(\Gamma_+,\Gamma_-)$. First, you let \begin{align*} \mathcal{P}_{n,+} &= \operatorname{End}(\underbrace{X\otimes X^*\otimes \cdots \otimes X^\pm}_{n \text{ copies}}) \\ \mathcal{P}_{n,-} &= \operatorname{End}(\underbrace{X^*\otimes X\otimes \cdots \otimes X^\mp}_{n \text{ copies}}) \end{align*} where $X^\pm=X$ if $n$ is odd and $X^*$ if $n$ is even. Now the graph $\Gamma_+$ has even vertices the simple summands of objects of the form $(X\otimes X^*)^{\otimes n}$, and odd vertices the simple summands of objects of the form $(X\otimes X^*)^{\otimes n}\otimes X$. You get the edges similar to before, taking an even $Y$, tensoring with $X$, and decomposing into simples $Z$. The graph $\Gamma_-$ is defined similarly, but swapping the roles of $X$ and $X^*$. So that's the formal explanation of how you get the principal graphs, but there is a simpler way to compute $(\Gamma_+,\Gamma_-)$ based on the fusion coefficients $N^{Y,X}_Z$. As @Xiao-Gang points out in the comments, we can compute $\Gamma_+$ as the connected component containing $X$ in the bipartite graph with adjacency matrix $$ \begin{pmatrix} 0 & N^X \\ N^{X^*} & 0 \end{pmatrix} $$ where $N^X$ is the matrix of fusion coefficients for tensoring on the right by $X$, and similarly for $X^*$. The graph $\Gamma_-$ is then obtained by swapping the roles of $X$ and $X^*$. Interestingly, if $X\in \mathcal{C}$ is self-dual and the fusion graph $\Gamma_X$ in $\mathcal{C}$ is already bipartite (here, $\mathcal{C}$ is $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$-graded and $X$ is odd), then $(\Gamma_+,\Gamma_-) = (\Gamma_X, \Gamma_X)$. This occurs for many interesting examples. 

By chance I wrote, not long ago, the following applet (HTML5+JS+WebGL) that works at least on Firefox and Chrome. $URL$ This work is CC-BY-SA, including the code, but NOT the image by Escher, for which I have not asked permission: you can probably use it a few times in conferences (fair use) but not in a permanent publication (and I will eventually have to remove this image or to create a variant of my own, like Valdimir Bulatov). 

To be more precise I am interested in questions similar to the one below (I asked the question below on math.stackexchange last week but got not answer.) I have a $C^1$ function $f:[0,1]^2 \to \mathbb{R}$. The arclength of the graph of $f_y:x\mapsto f(x,y)$ is $$L(y)=\int_0^1 \sqrt{1+\left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}(x,y)\right)^2} dx$$ Deriving under the integral does not seem to be possible since it would involve a crossed derivative $\partial^2 f/\partial x\partial y$ whose existence is not assumed. Hence I do not expect L to always be a $C^1$ function of y. But so far I have not been able to find a counterexample. This question must have been already looked at. Any idea? 

The answer is no. In fact, the group planar algebra has no non-trivial planar ideals. If $P_\bullet$ is a spherical planar algebra with non-zero modulus, and if $P_{0,\pm}$ are one dimensional, then every planar ideal is contained in the planar ideal $N_\bullet$ of negligible elements, i.e., those $x\in P_{n,\pm}$ for which tr$(xy)=0$ for all $y\in P_{n,\pm}$. (See Proposition 3.5 of the extended Haagerup paper of Bigelow-Morrison-Peters-Snyder MR2979509.) Now the group planar algebra is a subfactor planar algebra. In particular, the negligible ideal is the zero ideal, since the form $\langle x,y\rangle = \text{tr}(y^*x)$ is positive definite. I'll think about the followup question. 

It is not known in general when such fusion rings are categorifiable (see e.g. Evans and Gannon's "Near-group fusion categories and their doubles" MR3167494), but a necessary requirement is that $n=|G|-1$ or $n=k|G|$ for some $k\geq 0$. 

the universal cover of C minus two points, Ahlfors' conjectured optimal function for the Bloch constant. This will not be possible for C. 

In short: D is hyperbolic, C is parabolic (this is very vague, I know; there is at least one thing that makes me uneasy about all this presentation of things: that C nevertheless contains D.). Now, anytime you have an island, you have a patch that is a copy of the domain D$_i$. If you start from a point in the domain, mapped in D$_i$, and try to lift D$_i$ by f and hit a problem, is may be because you need to put a ramification point, so this increases the number of patches you need... kind of... in fact you will probalbyhave to cut your patch into smaller pieces, because of more ramification points: but then the heuristics is that it only improves things (it makes dom(f) more hyperbolic). If the problem is not due to a ramification point, then it there is an asymptotic value, and again this leads to many patches: in some sense, it is even more hyperbolic than just having ramification points. If $f$ is transcendental and some D$_i$ has only finitely many islands, then close enough to the boundary of dom(f), it is a bit like there is no islands. By the discussion above other preimages will be ramified, or worse. Now if there are enough D$_i$ with this property, then the game is to see that, on a purely combinatorial level, there must at least an exponential growth of the patches (this is idealistic but this gives an idea): this is what happens with the two examples above. Let us look at an example that works not: cos(z). Its critical points are points of $\pi\mathbb Z$, half of which get mapped to -1 the other half to 1. There is no asymptotic value (in fact, infinity is). The number of patches (whatever that means) grows linearly with the combinatorial distance. More precisely if you take D$_1$ and D$_2$ two disks about -1 and 1, their preimages are all ramified of ramification number=2. Join them by a line. Then the preimage of this picture is many disks-like domains at all the points of $\pi\mathbb Z$ all joined to the next by a line. This graph is more "euclidean" than "hyperbolic". Now if you have three domains D$_i$, take a point outside and link this point to each D$_i$ by disjoint curves, giving a Y-shaped picture with three disks attached at the tips. Ideally, the preimage of this graph contains (infinitely) many copies of this Y-shaped curve with disks at tips and to each of these disk (with finitely many exceptions) is attached at least two distinct copies of a Y. Such a graph is necessarily hyperbolic. Again, I do not know the proof of Ahlfors' theorems, and I completely forgot the proof of Bloch's theorem, so all this may be far from the actual proofs. This is just my point of view on things. 

For convenience, let's identify $L(G)$ with its image in $\ell^2(G)$ as per @Matthew Daws' answer. For $f=\sum_{g\in G} \mu_g L_g\in\ell^2(G)$, we have $f\in L(G)$ if and only if $f* \xi\in \ell^2(G)$ for all $\xi\in \ell^2(G)$, where $*$ is convolution. Another way of saying this is that $L(G)$ is all $\ell^2$-sums which define bounded operators on $\ell^2(G)$ by convolution. A good reference for this is Vaughan Jones' course notes/book on von Neumann algebras. 

It depends on the conventions that you pick, but if you pick them correctly, you'll get what you want. First, for a normal linear functional $f$ on $B(H)$, there is a unique partial isometry $v\in B(H)$ and positive normal linear functional $|f|$ such that $f=v|f|$ and $v^*v$ is the support projection of $|f|$, where we use the convention that $v|f|(a) = |f|(av)$ for all $a\in B(H)$. See Theorem 4.3.2 of $URL$ for more details on this. Suppose $x\in B(H)$ is trace class, and consider the induced normal linear functional $f = \operatorname{Tr}(\,\cdot\,x)$ on $B(H)$. Now let's look at the polar decomposition of $x = u|x|$, which satisfies $\ker(u)=\ker(|x|)=\ker(x)$, so $u^*u$ is the support projection of $|x|$, and $u^*x=|x|$. Then $|x|$ induces a positive normal linear functional on $B(H)$, which we'll call $g$. One sees that for all $a\in B(H)$, \begin{align*} ug(a) &= g(au) = \operatorname{Tr}(au|x|)=\operatorname{Tr}(ax) = f(a) \\ u^*f(a) &= f(au^*) = \operatorname{Tr}(au^*x)=\operatorname{Tr}(a|x|) = g(a). \end{align*} Thus $ug = f$ and $u^*f = g$, so we see $$ g(a)=[u^*f](a)=[u^*(ug)](a)=[ug](au^*)=g(au^*u), $$ and $u^*u$ dominates the support projection of $g$. We easily verify that for all $b\in B(H)$, $$ g(b(1-u^*u))=\operatorname{Tr}(b(1-u^*u)|x|)=\operatorname{Tr}(b(|x|-u^*u|x|))=\operatorname{Tr}(b0)=0, $$ so $u^*u$ is exactly the support projection of $g$. This means that if $f=v|f|$ is the polar decomposition of $f$, then by the uniqueness of the polar decomposition, we must have that $|f|=g=\operatorname{Tr}(\,\cdot\,|x|)$ and $v=u$. 

For a year I have been giving lectures on a (probalby) new way to present an explicit sphere eversion. These lectures include a review of many other explicit eversions that have been described, as text, drawings or even computer generated movies, since Smale proved his theorem. During these lectures, I have been frequently asked the following question: are these eversions all equivalent? I suppose the meaning of this question is: can you deform one eversion into another? A more general question is: What is the $\pi_1$ of the space $I$ of immersions of $S^2$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$? Recall that Smale proved that $I$ is connected so that there is a path from the canonical embedding to the antipodal embedding, which is the definition of a sphere eversion. The set of all eversions up to homotopy is in (non canonical) bijection with the $\pi_1$ above. If the latter were trivial, then all eversions would be equivalent, and conversely. But as far as I have understood, it is not the case.
