2 beat This is good for distance swimming but it will quickly reveal body position issues. You want to concentrate on "swimming downhill" (think pushing your chest down and trying to keep your legs level with your upper body). And you may need to increase your stroke rate somewhat. You can do a drill by swimming with a band around your ankles (cut a piece of an old inner tube or something) This is very hard but it forces you to work on level body position. To work on the 2 beat timing, zoomer fins can be helpful. They'll give you extra propulsion at first, and get your legs to make the whipping motion that is correct for this kick. 

This might not appeal to everyone, but swimming is a solid cardio activity that will burn fat and won't build your legs much. It's mostly about back, shoulders and core. It isn't weight bearing or impact-centric like running or soccer. If you're not a strong swimmer already and you're interested, I highly recommend getting some lessons for awhile. Once you're swimming laps with confidence, consider joining a masters group so you can really push yourself during each workout. 

6 beat Focus on a smaller range of motion in your kick. If your legs are moving too much you're not going to get all the kicks in time, like you said. Work on a smooth stroke and try not to be thrashy with the kick. 

Finally Watch video of good swimmers using both of these techniques. Get a friend to video you. Compare and learn. Good 2-beat: $URL$ I'll try to find some others. 4-beat is sometimes ok (in a 1-3 variation where the swimmer breathes to one side -- ex: Grant Hackett). But often it indicates a stroke imbalance. Which is a good reason to get yourself videoed and find out what you're doing. 

You're doing a good thing by warming up first with a walk or slower paced run. Nothing wrong with that. The best way to improve your running, simple as it sounds, is to run more. Consistency is your best friend. The way to be consistent is to slowly increase your training load. If you go out and run hard one day, then require several days of rest, you probably need to back off your pace or distance a bit. Concentrate on getting into a routine. I'd suggest around 3 days per week if you're just starting out. More experienced runners can bump that up. Work on some short or medium distance runs during the weekdays and a longer run on the weekend. You're building up to the 10km, not running the whole thing right away. Slowly bump up the distance of each of those, maybe +1 mile every week or two. The idea is to build a progressive training load that your body will adapt to. Walking part of the time is fine if you need to. You should be able to carry on a conversation. Breathing too hard to talk = running too hard. The reason is that you're working on your aerobic engine. Harder efforts get more into your anaerobic capacity which is not what you need for 10km. Hard efforts also increase the risk of injury. Hope that helps. [source = me, 6x Ironman finisher] 

I have been a labourer, chucking bricks, carrying timber, etc. for a month. Despite lifting things all day, our bodies aren't in good condition. We have a heavy risk of straining and wearing down our joints — especially our wrists and forearms (because we grip heavy things all day) and our backs (because of awkward postures for long periods of time). I know nothing about fitness or physiology. What can I do to reduce my risk of getting worn-out, inflamed, injured joints? 

There is a definite correlation with people who strength train and longevity. Even if it is just becuase they slow age-related muscle loss (sarcopenia) people who strength train tend to live longer. I was wondering when does the correlation end, or, more precisely, when does getting stronger become equivalent to maintaining strength if your goal is longevity. For example, if I trained consistently for a year would I obtain any further longevity benefit from building more strength VS maintaining? 

I've been lifting for a couple of months, Mon-Wed-Fri, no problem. I changed jobs and now I'm thinking about changing it to Sat-Wed-Sun — I am a lot busier on weekdays now. I know it will impede my progress. I know it's not optimal. But I don't mind too much, becuase I'm expecting it not to matter that much. Will it be fine? Should I expect progress to be really slow? Or would it be best to lift Sat-Wed and keep Sunday for prehab? 

I don't care about being flexible. I can touch my toes fine because I did a lot of stretching as a kid, I feel like I am naturally flexible. I am definitely not 'tight'. I also think stretching is boring. Given that I don't care about being more flexible, is there any possible benefit to stretching? 

Does aerobic training (cardio) help a 4-minute gymnastic rings performance? In Overcoming Gravity Steven Low argues that an Olympic artistic rings performance is around 4 minutes, the same time as the world record for the mile. The mile is strongly influenced by aerobic capacity, so a 4 minute rings performance would be too (to a lesser extent). This seems really dodgy reasoning to me (the sports have many differences), so I'm asking the question here. Would cardio help a 4-minute rings performance? 

Progress is easy, given you train regularly and have sufficient nutrition and rest. For a beginner. When you become advanced and your achievements much better then those of untrained people , you need to plan cycles , as progress is possible only in specific part of the body or one skill at a time. When you become elite, ie world class sportsmen say olimpics, world championships, national level .... At this stage your life is organized around one specific event (or say season). Hardly you are an elite as in this case you would have a coach/trainer. So i assume you are a novice. In this case you could try to change one of 3 variables: You train too hard too often. You do not get enough food to recover. You do not have enough sleep/rest to recover. And there is a possibility that your training is not intencive enough to shift the homeostasis. 8 minutes look too short to me , however if you do Tabata protocol , for example it is even too much , especially every day. Try to think of it and change one thing at a time , observe the results over 2 weeks period and then decide . 

I second on Tabata protocol , note however , that the (very good) endurance increase is subject to 2 issues: 1) you should be pretty fit to doing tabata 2) the gains will stall after 3 weeks (or something like that), so you could expect 6 to 12 good training sessions , that will do you good. after that you will gain nothing. 

IMHO Quit drinking too much coffee. It helps. Also low carb diets reduce sleep hours and fasting as well. But generally , there is no reason to sleep less in order to sleep more. Heavy workout effect is much longer then 1 day. 

in general weight (own or external ) training does not burn much calories. 1) Adjust your diet accordingly . 2) Walk/run/bike around a hour to burn additional calories. I am not telling you that weight training is bad , i am only telling you that to burn fat , you need to spend more calories than you consume. However as you did not told your weight/height i am not even sure you need fat loss at all. Maybe you do not see your abs as there are no much abs there. I do not know. 

This got me wondering about how much strength crossovers to muscular endurance. I am NOT talking about marathon-like endurance (which weight training improves), but how, say, your bench press 1RM correlates with the amount of push-ups you can do, even if you've never trained push-ups endurance. What is the amount of carryover, and the mechanism(s) of strength increasing muscular endurance? 

Nicotine seems to be a performance-enhancing drug, like caffeine. But because nicotine is associated with smoking, it seems dangerous to try a nicotine patch to get better gym results. Is it safe? And if so, how should I dose it? Are there any unwanted side effects? 

I live with my family who eat a regular western diet (or maybe slightly healthier becuase of me). They eat few and eat mostly storebought. They are not interested in being healthy. That's fine becuase they don't care and I can't do anything about it (I tried). However I want to be different. We always eat dinner together, and they don't exactly make kale salads. Tonight is salmon noodles with 'things' like refined wheat noodles, soy sauce, fish farm salmon, honey, etc. If there's anything I'm trying to avoid, it will crop up in significant amounts from once a week to every night. They go out for dinner/lunch almost once a week, and it isn't nice to order salads at restuarant when everyone else indulges. They say they can't order takeaway for dinner, or make 'fun stuff' more often because of me. Where can I draw the line between healthy and social? If they go out for ice-cream, I won't go. I don't have any conditions and have been 'different' for about a year (lots of nutritious food, little junk). 

I am trying to gain strength, which leaves a lot of rest time in between sets (3-5 minutes). I am a beginner and have no clue what to do in between sets! I kind of just dag around. What are some decent things to do in between sets? 

The main idea is to have two phases. Short period of carbs restrictions to lower insulin production and thus heightened lipolysys. At that time high protein content of the nutrition along with weight training must pre-serve muscles from wasting even despite lower caloric income. Then in the second phase carb refeed comes in raising metabolic rate, hormones production and improving metabolism. This is the idea. detailed discussion may be found in UUD2 book by Lyle McDonald. Personally i found this approach to be too difficult for the results. However the diet (UUD2, which is a detailed plan based on carb cycling combined with very special training) is quite effective to minimize fat gains during bulking or maintain muscles during fat loss. 

Usually people overcomplicate things. While it is possible you are an exception, but chanses are you just doing your training and nutrition wrong. I would suggest getting training/nutrition coaching from some of good online coaches. This is the most cost/time effective way to improve, Really. Let me point you to $URL$ or $URL$ In no way i am associated with the coaches. BTW maximum gains over 2 year period would be about 36 pounds. So i'd say you did pretty well. 

Well , muscle memory cannot be maximized. The effect is in a number of cell nuclei. During initial training the number becomes higher and then remains the same "forever". The new nuclei are taken form stem cells. $URL$ So, by now you have all the memory you need. Just use the most efficient muscle building program and eat and sleep well and you could gain your muscles back very soon. Depending on your genetics and AAS usage status it may take a year , or a month , see $URL$ 

The real answer is oxygen debt during the set. It is the same effect as with sprinting all-out. $URL$ 

$URL$ Myonuclei acquired by overload exercise precede hypertrophy and are not lost on detraining. Bruusgaard JC1, Johansen IB, Egner IM, Rana ZA, Gundersen K. Abstract Effects of previous strength training can be long-lived, even after prolonged subsequent inactivity, and retraining is facilitated by a previous training episode. Traditionally, such "muscle memory" has been attributed to neural factors in the absence of any identified local memory mechanism in the muscle tissue. We have used in vivo imaging techniques to study live myonuclei belonging to distinct muscle fibers and observe that new myonuclei are added before any major increase in size during overload. The old and newly acquired nuclei are retained during severe atrophy caused by subsequent denervation lasting for a considerable period of the animal's lifespan. The myonuclei seem to be protected from the high apoptotic activity found in inactive muscle tissue. A hypertrophy episode leading to a lasting elevated number of myonuclei retarded disuse atrophy, and the nuclei could serve as a cell biological substrate for such memory. Because the ability to create myonuclei is impaired in the elderly, individuals may benefit from strength training at an early age, and because anabolic steroids facilitate more myonuclei, nuclear permanency may also have implications for exclusion periods after a doping offense. 

If I had a dollar for something along the lines of... "lots of sitting every day gives you tight hip flexors and hamstrings/calves...". I am skeptical of that claim. It's plausible, but seems taken for granted everywhere. Some muscles (eg adductors) seem to be in a constantly tight state. I've never heard "keeping your legs together gives you tight adductors". I was wondering if there is any science based evidence showing sitting actually reduces flexibility of you hip flexors and hamstring/calves. 

I fast once a week to be healthy and improve performance. It is intermittent fasting (I restrict eating to a four hour window). I have insomnia almost every time and a quick google search shows multiple forums with the same issue — but no resolution. I almost never have insomnia when I don't fast. Is it ok to have insomnia, or is something else (eg. hormones out of whack) causing me to have insomnia when I fast? 

Untrained 50 year old looking to build strength with the intention preserving muscle while aging, joining a gym soon. Will not get a PT, is looking for 'gentle' exercises. Not willing to suffer much pain. Will something build strength while being (relatively) comfortable? For example, a lower weight than usual. Is it possible to build and maintain strength for a beginner with little discomfort? 

I follow a very basic routine of squat, deadlift, pull-up (weighted) and bench press, and have for many weeks. What are some isolation, muscle-specific or machine exercises to 'fill-in the gaps'? One example that comes to mind is something for the rhomboids. 

I am planning to do HIIT and want to buy one (cheap, under $100) piece of equipment for the whole body. I cannot sprint because I live in a busy city with few open spaces, however I would be fine with equipment like a suspension trainer or skipping rope. I'm not a beginner, and wouldn't mind high impact exercises. Please do not recommend bodyweight exercises — they are just not for me (I've tried), and not what this question is about. If your piece of equipment has any other benefits (eg. portable, scalable), please put that in your answer as well!
