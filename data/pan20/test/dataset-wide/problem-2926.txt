Perhaps this is out of place, but there seems to be an aspect of it that is sometimes neglected in the discussions about time and space. I was thinking about the role of our brains in creating our experience with space and time. Our brains are perhaps not all processing the information (conceivably coming from some sort of unseen common environment) at the same speed and in the same way. We each have our own little private reality being generated by our brains. That reality is limited by the sensory experiential capacity of our brain states. It unfolds for us at the rate our brains are processing the information, and our perception of the passage of time can change depending on our states of consciousness and the ways our brains are functioning. Our brains are filtering out or not even registering massive amounts of information from the potential environment to create each moment of conscious experience. Our little worlds, that seem to be cohesive stable spaces with a bunch of objects behaving in regular ways, is a creation of our brains. It may correlate in some way to things happening outside of it, but some of what we observe may be effects occurring because of the way our brains are wired and the way our neurons are working. Or we could say the environment or reality we experience with our bodies and so forth seems to be a simulation created by our brains. The actual environment where our brains reside may be wholly different from the one we experience, our space and time, objects, and so forth. A paradox that seems incomprehensible because of our intuitive understanding of spacetime from our immediate environment or experience may take an entirely different form beyond our understanding or ability to imagine in the actual world that is hidden from us. Something about these infinity paradoxes and the potential impossibility of reconciling them could be behind why we exist and why we have a sense of movement through time, perhaps because there is an infinity where there are always more possibilities that can be created endlessly, creating a growing or expanding limit. Our brains must slice out little snippets of the potential to make our stories. We need to observe the world as a single cohesive narrative unfolding with things seeming to move around at a certain pace in a space, otherwise, it seems that it would just be a chaos of meaningless disjointed experiences or we would not be conscious of it at all. Our brains are perhaps somehow putting the appearance of something finite together in our immediate field of awareness, taking limits in some probabilistic way or picking things out from a larger set of possible information states, to create an evolving moment of experience and interpretation of spacetime events. There was something about limits of consciousness and infinity I was thinking about in response to the OP but I'm not sure if any of it makes sense, so I'll just stop here and perhaps edit it later. Sorry, I'm new to this site. I'm not sure how formal this is supposed to be. I'm not sure if this is helpful or welcome or anything like a conclusive answer to something, but there could be something in there for the OP to think about while imagining space going on forever in the mind. 

You might want to investigate the word “Holism”. “Holism in general terms (whether in science, sociology, economics, linguistics or philosophy) is the idea that all the properties of a given system cannot be determined or explained by its component parts alone, but the system as a whole determines in an important way how the parts behave” $URL$ “Meaning Holism The term “meaning holism” is generally applied to views that treat the meanings of all of the words in a language as interdependent. Holism draws much of its appeal from the way in which the usage of all our words seems interconnected, and runs into many problems because the resultant view can seem to conflict with (among other things) the intuition that meanings are by and large shared and stable.” $URL$ $URL$ 

I'm not following the "imminent" and "clay" analogy. About the God or Creative intelligence of the Universe... It seems that people assume they understand what it is and what is going on and they are sure that whatever their conception is cannot possibly exist, or they are sure that it must exist. The naysayers are often just as rigid and certain of their conception of the world as any fanatical religious person. I'm not sure that high levels of certainty about it, either way, is justified or makes sense. It seems that they would need to have a conception of what it is to say that it does not exist. Perhaps whatever they are assuming about it is incorrect. It could be one of those possibilities that we just can't rule out. There are lots of little possibilities that we just can't rule out. There could be something going on that we have no way of conceiving for some reason. Not knowing for sure could be part of a test. It makes me suspicious though something is going on even though I'm not consciously aware of what it is right now. Even if you don't know, you can act "as if" there is something beautiful and divine in the universe, whatever it might be. If it does exist, I love it, because this really is a beautiful and amazing world. When I accept that as a possibility it can be very beautiful, and it can be an adaptive coping mechanism for many people, so I don't discourage people from believing in it. Although sometimes I change my mind about it depending on how things are going and my mood. If this life were some an ethics test to see what your actual nature is or how you might respond to this situation, it would seem that not knowing for sure could be an essential element of the test, couldn't it? That could be why we are blocked everywhere we go from having the answer or only have a little trickle of hints and ongoing mysteries. People behave differently when they know that they are being watched and evaluated. That could be a little clue. For all you know you haven't been put in a world simulator 20 minutes ago in some future world with all your memories implanted and so forth, and you are being given all sorts of little ethics tests as part of a job interview or something. You could be a robot and scientists in some other world are observing whether you are safe to exist in their real world. Or it could be an ethics test for the scientists, and there is something above them testing to see how they would behave if they thought they had the power to make a consciousness. What sorts of things would they consider when creating life? How much care and thought would you like your Creator to put into your existence if there is one? It could be a game you have to figure out. Perhaps it is some form of entertainment or a learning module. We don't know, or perhaps I should say, I don't know. I don't know whatever you know. We or I can only speculate about these sorts of things right now. The possibilities are endless, and it seems to be a similar thing with the idea of a Creator or creative intelligence behind the universe. If there is something that could create this world and everything, it seems it would beyond our present capacity or normal level of consciousness to comprehend whatever that is. If it did exist, it could make itself known or not known at any time, and even if the answer were right in front of you, you might not see it if it didn't want you to see it or you might forget about it. There is so much that people assume. It does seem very suspicious though sometimes and it does feel as though there is a beautiful, powerful, loving presence with me that occasionally makes itself known to me, so I don't rule it out. Beautiful things like music, love, art, dogs, consciousness, and so on all seem in some ways like clues that there is something incredible and beyond my current comprehension going on. I don't know what it is. It could be a little flood of chemicals in my brain or a delusion, but the experience of the presence does seem to happen in response to things I am thinking about, and I like the idea of it. It feels incredible when it happens. It is a distinct experience for me, so I act as if it is something--a little imaginary friend in my mind perhaps, a helpful Jiminy Cricket who applauds good things. There is nothing wrong with that. I'm not religious about it though. Many people report that it is helpful. It seems to like it when I think about it or talk to it privately in my mind. Sometimes I have a few choice words for it when it doesn't do what I want though. But the way things sometimes unfold just seems to be a giveaway, and thinking about the mysteries of the world can lead to that sort of thinking, but you can't be sure. There is much conflicting information to sort through, and there are countless possibilities out there that can confuse us and possibly misdirect us. That seems to be the game. So I keep an open mind about it.
