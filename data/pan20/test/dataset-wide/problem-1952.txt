Your commute is your personal time. And how much time you spend in the office is up to you and your employer. I don't know how it works at your company, but I have never heard of an employer who would say something like "Oh, you have a 2 hour commute, therefore you only need to work 6 hours per day, while your coworkers must work 8 hours." Imagine if it were the other way around. Then your 2-hours-one-way friends would only be in the office for 4 hours? Not likely. And if you are a salaried PhD, I'm assuming you aren't working to the clock anyway. In my company, I tell the folks on my team that I expect them to work to get the job done. If that means they can get it done in less than 40 hours, then leave if you want. If that means they need to stay extra, then I expect them to stay extra when they can. But all this also means that it is the work that is the time-driver here, not the commute. Lengthening their commute doesn't mean there is less work to be done. 

That's not something I would ever do to a recruiter with whom I've agreed to work (as opposed to someone who sent me an unsolicited email or phone call). My personal ethics wouldn't allow it. Your mileage may vary. Also consider that if the recruiter hears what you are doing, he may call the hiring manager and complain about it. Then you might look like a weasel in the eyes of a potential employer. 

If you really want to do right by them, let someone else contact the candidate (perhaps a different recruiter) or have the company connect with the candidate directly. You had your chance, did something objectionable and your contact isn't wanted any longer. So now you need to bow out. 

Some employers deem a portfolio as a critical attribute, others don't. In my hiring, I seldom cared about a "portfolio". For the positions I was filling, the answers to my questions were far more important that projects the applicants chose to do in their spare time. I've always felt that work done at the behest of an employer, under time deadlines, was a far better predictor of future performance than a self-selected project done in the individual's spare time. Your mileage may vary. 

It doesn't seem that there's much to appeal here. I suppose you could try to make it a public issue, go to the local media or local town officials, indicate that a 60-year-old is being mistreated, etc. Honestly, I don't think that would help or be a good thing to do. As you indicated, the role she was seeking is being dissolved anyway. Unfortunately, she may simply need to seek employment elsewhere, just as if this opening had never existed. It seems unlikely that she could force them to hire her if they really don't want to do so (for whatever reason). 

It's rather sketchy that your manager shared the reasons for not hiring your friend with you. For me, that's a very questionable practice. Unless your friend explicitly indicated that this sort of information could be shared with you, it feels inappropriate. It seems like it would compound the problem even more for you to then pass this information on to your friend. Why didn't your manager convey the reasons to your friend? If he wasn't willing to do that, why would you think it is okay for you to do so? Would you feel comfortable asking your manager's permission to pass along the reasons for her not getting hired? If not, why would you think it's okay to tell her? Give her job searching advice. Give her career advice. But don't relay the specifics of this job situation. 

Unless you know the individuals personally, there's nothing you can do. Certainly complaining to LinkedIn or your company won't help at all in my experience.. I suppose if you are friends with the "perpetrator" you could say something like "Hey, I was browsing LinkedIn the other day and I happened to notice that your profile is out of date." That could work with some friends, but might offend others. LinkedIn, while tilted toward professional interests, is still entirely self-directed and self-edited social media. It may actually have a formal mechanism for reporting cases where you don't agree with what is written. I haven't actually seen a case where that accomplished anything. Users can write anything they choose. They can write the truth, or they can write complete falsehoods - none of it is vetted or curated. A quick search through folks you know will certainly show that. I suspect much of what you are seeing is due to that fact that most people don't bother to keep their social media very up-to-date. If you took a survey, I suspect you'd find that most people's LinkedIn account is at least mildly out of date. It's often just "one of those things I need to do" that we never quite get around to doing. 

then Yes, it's appropriate, and you should ask for double (or perhaps triple or even more) your current salary. Of course, that doesn't mean you'll get it, as some of your assumptions may be incorrect, your boss and/or company may not want to set a precedent, or they may have other reasons for denying you. Also ask yourself why you would continue working for a company that pays all of it's software engineers $120k, when you are worth $240k. In my part of the world, I've never known anyone to ask for and receive such an increase, no matter how good they were. But there's always a first time. 

This is totally within your control. You can sit down with your boss, and say something like "Boss, I really appreciate your confidence in me, but this isn't what I want to do for work. I'd like to go back to just being a Tech Support guy." If you start to feel that justification is needed, you could talk about feeling burned out, but I wouldn't go there unless it's necessary. And of course if our boss insists that you must do this work, you can always quit. 

If you feel strongly about it, you can always volunteer to be let go. You shouldn't suggest that others be laid off, that's not your responsibility, but you can choose to sacrifice yourself. 

Don't be hesitant. I'm always happy when members of my team come to me with suggestions. Over the years, I've always asked all new members to come to me with what they are seeing. "New eyes" often see things that others take for granted. The best way to do this is to approach your manager individually and informally, rather than within a group meeting. Say something like "Hey, boss, I've been thinking. What's the chance of changing the {formal meetings} so they only occur every other week?" If he/she is interested, you can then expand a bit and indicate how you feel they might be getting in the way of more progress. Be ready, though, for a bit of pushback. Meetings often serve multiple purposes - some of which you may not yet be aware. While the weekly aspect of the meetings may be overkill for your needs, others on the team may benefit in ways you don't yet understand, and may benefit from weekly time. Either way, make your conversation friendly, helpful, and avoid an "I'm smarter than people who have been here a long time" attitude and you'll be fine. 

No way to tell. "Too much" is a personal issue. Some folks like to have a lot to do, a lot of daily challenge, and a lot of responsibility. Some like to be the big fish in a small pond. Some don't. 

This is a perfectly reasonable thing to bring up during the interview (particularly for a part-timer), and one I ask about all the time. You don't want to hire someone who will quickly decide to leave just because the commute is too long and stressful. In the past, I've said things like "I see you live in Town X. I'm guessing that's going to make for a long commute each day. How do you feel about that? Have you had positions with such a commute in the past?" Then, I listen for the reaction. Some folks are perfectly happy with commutes far longer than I could ever tolerate any more. Some folks enjoy a calming commute home while others need to get home quickly to meet the needs of their family. So it's a topic I try hard never to pre-judge. 

Search the internet. You'll find many references to this style of interview question. Read through them and try to come up with a reasonable answer without letting the absurdity bother you. Practice helps! Often, the folks asking such questions pick them off of the same searches, so you might get lucky and have already read the one they are asking. This might help get you started: $URL$ And after you are hired and advance in your career such that you are the hiring manager - choose better interview questions! 

What happens differs depending on the rules in your company. If you aren't clear, you should ask HR. Some companies combine vacation days and sick days into a single PTO category. You are expected to manage your own time off in whatever way works best for you. For people who don't take much sick time, it's a good deal. For others who need a lot of sick time, it's not such a good deal. If your past work history indicates that you will need a lot of sick or miscellaneous time off, then you may simply need to plan on less vacation time. You might need to learn how to handle the "dumb but required" stuff without taking time off. Many of us find ways to get things done first thing in the morning or later in the day (where being a bit late or leaving a bit early isn't a problem in the company). If that doesn't work, then nights and weekends can often suffice. As a last resort, you can sometimes get someone else to run the errands for you (as a favor, or as a paid task). It's all about time management. Some companies would permit you to take unpaid time off, at your discretion. I haven't encountered a lot of those companies, but my sense is that this should be the exception - to be used only in unusual situations. And abuse of this would be a mark against you during an annual review. Combined vacation/PTO isn't something I prefer, but it is handled by many. But even if sick time were kept separate from vacation, you'd still need to learn how to deal with the situation. IT work is generally not like shift work - you usually can't just decide not to be around and swap your time for someone else's. It sounds like this is new for you, and something you need to learn how to handle. You might want to chat with your co-workers to learn how they deal with it. Eventually, you'll settle in to the professional work life and it won't seem so foreign. 

You don't yet know what is behind this year's scenario. Thus it's hard to plan how to avoid something, since you don't yet know what you are avoiding. Perhaps once your boss learns about the upper-management review of the new process, you'll have more insight. It's possible that the process will be revised to provide more feedback; that would only make sense. And it's possible the stack ranking process will be abandoned - I personally find them worse than useless. But for now, there's not really anything you can do, other than continue to work to the best of your abilities as you have done. Continue to keep in touch with your boss and get continued feedback on your work. And hope for the best. You might also want to make sure your resume is kept up to date, in case things don't get any better and you decide you've had enough. 

Yes, it would be rude to start an email with "As I stated in the previous email", even if that's factual. While that clearly isn't your intention, it could easily come across as "If you weren't so stupid, you would have seen that I already gave you the answer...". It can be tough to handle customer support. Some clients immediately understand you, but others take more hand-holding. This is particularly true when you aren't dealing with folks face-to-face (or even on the telephone) where you could immediately confirm their understanding. When using email, sometimes more back-and-forth as well as repetition is required. And as @DavidK wisely points out, if email isn't working, perhaps a phone call is in order? You could both refer to your email, as you walk them through their issues. 

Work with a headhunter in an agency. Specify exactly what you want, and what you don't want. Expect to wait a while while the headhunter finds you a suitable position. Or, go the contractor route. Often contractors are able to do pretty much what you seek - come in, do the work, go home, make no friends, and interact with others seldom. You'll have to check for yourself about the "open office" thing. Sometimes a company's website hints at their culture - check for a "careers" page or a "work with us" page. Usually the ones who offer the kind of culture you'd rather avoid tend to boast about it. Look for a company with no such page, or one that just lists jobs and doesn't talk at all about company culture. You could also browse a site where folks review their companies, like Glassdoor. Look for companies that are rated poorly with people complaining about exactly the things you would prefer. 

It used to be relatively common that HR, upon being notified of a death in an employee's family, would send off a quick letter of condolence on behalf of the company. I received one myself when my grandfather passed away many, many years ago. But that seems rather rare in these less formal workplace days. In fact letters on the whole have often been replaced by emails. When a sad or happy occasion occurs for an employee these days, an email is typically sent out, sometimes followed up by a card that has been passed around for signatures. I haven't seen letters being sent in a long time. 

You could simply choose to ignore the accusations from someone who has no basis for them. Or you could again talk with HR, and ask how you and they together can get them stopped. 

I can imagine a case where it benefits the company. (Although if the company were as bad as you indicated, I don't imagine they would be open to constructive criticism anyway). What I can't see is how it can benefit the departing employee in any way. I'd still advise to give only neutral feedback. Any feedback you could provide on the way out could be gotten through existing employees, if the company ever really wanted to know. 

Whenever I resign from a job, I always tell my boss first. Then I ask if he or she will be telling others, and when. Since I am in management, I always request the courtesy of telling my team directly - that has always been granted. Often, I am asked to wait a few days while my boss notifies others in the management chain, and occasionally tries to convince me to stay. I always agree to wait a few days, although I don't accept a counter-offer. Within a few days I start telling others, if they haven't heard already. In short, talk with you boss and arrange a time in the near future so that everyone will know about your departure one way or the other.
