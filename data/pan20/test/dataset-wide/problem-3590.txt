It sounds like you have Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness, or DOMS for short. This is perfectly normal if you are performing long sets of pushups with proper form. Proper form being that your torso is board straight from your head to your feet. DOMS is more prevalent when you drastically increase your efforts for any muscle group more than it is used to being stressed. In any given set, your abs are engaged the whole time to help remain that straight as a board form, while your arms and chest have small breaks as they are moving. The good news is that as your body adapts to the new level of work (and rate of increase), the DOMS will go away. That said, some warning signs to watch out for are: 

There's a bit of disagreement on the optimal window. I've heard ranges from only 15 minutes to a full hour (my weight loss center gave me the latter window). If it's 15 minutes I can pass that window with my post lift stretches and shower. The bottom line is that you do need more protein when lifting weights. Some studies suggest that timing is not an issue at all, and some studies show that you do absorb a bit more protein just after a workout. Usually the ones that favor the window are funded by protein manufacturers. Still other studies suggest that it's carbs that you need just after workout more than protein. Honestly, you can drive yourself nuts thinking about optimal windows. The difference in protein absorption isn't orders of magnitude more. The kidneys process protein at a rate of 4-9g/hour, and I think that time just after workout kicks the kidneys to the higher end of the range. 

As to absolute values, all methods save one or two performed at doctors offices provide estimations based on different factors. The calipers are fairly accurate, if the person doing the measurements is consistent. Even if the absolute value is a bit off, the fact that it is consistent means you can adjust the number as needed. The electro-resistance methods are very dependent on your hydration, distribution of fat, time of day, water retention, etc. There are a couple methods that measure based on your density (i.e. water or air displacement). Nothing is as easy as checking the tape measure. You may not be able to get a reliable body fat number, but you will be able to tell which direction you are going. I recommend checking about once a month. If you have to do it more often I recommend not measuring more frequently than once a week. Personally, I have gained about 4 lbs since I initially lost weight, but have gone down a pant size in the process. That tells me I've reduced by body fat--I don't know exactly by how much, but it is down. 

Wendler 5/3/1 is designed around certain assumptions, and until you know how your body responds to the stimulus that the program provides you really don't have a foundation of knowledge of what the program isn't doing for you. There's already a great deal of flexibility in the program, but training 7 days a week is not within those constraints. Wendler recommends you do the program as written for at least 4-5 cycles before you start making it your own. He has a book called "Beyond 5/3/1" that is a collection of variations for different goals. Now, an option that is very much compatible with the tenants of 5/3/1 that would have you doing something every day would be something along the following schedule: 

The answer to your question lies in how you feel. If you feel run down, unmotivated, and you have to drag yourself to train, you are probably doing a bit much. It's natural not to be 100% when you are cutting fat, but when motivation suffers it's a symptom of over-training. The lifting portion of the program looks pretty decent, and there are a couple tweaks you can do to balance the work you need and the results you want. In order to improve your training result, you have to do the following: 

If you can more consistently train in the afternoon, your body will adjust to make it so you can more effectively train in the afternoon. The key is that you do it consistently. There are those that swear by different times of the day, but the bottom line is that their bodies adapted to that time schedule. Consistency trumps hormonal cycles when it comes to the chronic (i.e. cumulative) effect of training even though acute (i.e. one time) effects might favor something different. 

Sets to failure help build mass. Typically, sets to failure is the domain of the bodybuilder where the primary goal is to increase the size of the muscle rather than to increase strength. You can gain strength this way, but the primary result is larger muscles. By definition, when you go to failure, your form will start to degrade as you get later in the set, until you simply cannot lift the bar any longer. Trade offs: 

What you want does not exist. If you understand the basics of nutrition, you need a certain amount of protein, carbs and fat in your diet. Beyond that, vitamins and minerals. That's just for living, so how about building muscle? Bottom line: if you want to build muscle you have to work hard and lift heavy things. Your body will adapt to the stresses you put on it (exercise), and in its recovery it will supercompensate to handle what you told it to do plus a little spare capacity. If you want to build muscle you have to repeatedly increase what you ask of your muscle. If you take protein supplements, creatine, l-glutamine, etc. without putting in the work that causes your body to build muscle, they will be going to waste. Anything your body does not need is excess, and all excess is either discarded (as waste product) or stored as fat. In short, no pain, no gain. 

With just the first two bullets, we have a good reason to ditch the weightlifting gloves for deadlifts. Gloves cause your hands to sweat more, and they increase the effective bar thickness. They also can allow the bar to shift in your hand, making it harder to hold on to. In short, gloves are hurting your deadlift. Next, let's look at things you can do to increase your ability to grip the bar immediately (i.e. no strengthening required): 

Your replacement would have to fill these roles. Squats Now, squats are an excellent tool, and they hit many of the same areas, but they also get the quads, shins, and even a bit of the upper ab muscles. A good strength routine will have both squats and deadlifts. Back extensions Weighted and unweighted, back extensions will get your glutes and hams as well as your core. The stresses are different in that you are leaning forward, and the weight of the upper body is pulling down in a different way than deadlifts work. In short, your back will be part of performing the lift as well as keeping the thoracic portion in a neutral position. That said, they are still a good assistance exercise. These do not get your lats at all. Pullups Pullups will exercise the lats, as well as the neck muscles. They get a few more muscle groups as well, but they play a part in what deadlifts do. Summary Essentially you would need to include all three of these exercises to get the same benefit of deadlifts. The unfortunate truth of the matter is that deadlifts let you do one exercise at very high weights in comparison to the other three, so there is just no full replacement. 

Without defining these things you'll be constantly wondering whether you need to eat more/less/etc. Every milestone you'll be re-evaluating your estimated calorie expenditure at your then current activity level. As you increase activity, your body burns more calories. Also, as your lean mass increases, your body burns more calories at rest. As you become more athletic your body responds by doing what's necessary to keep up that activity--which includes getting rid of the fat stores. No matter what, you will never lose weight unless you have a moderate deficit. By moderate, I'm talking about eating enough to lose 1-2 lbs a week. 2 lbs is OK if you have a lot to lose, but 1 lb if you are within 10 lbs of your goal. Too aggressive a deficit can actually work against you. 

The number one mistake that I and many other people new to squats make is to look up. We're either looking in the mirror to evaluate our form or we are looking at our waist directly. Either way the head is not in an anatomically neutral position. It's amazing how a small adjustment like that can fix balance problems or back position problems. To deal with flexibility, there are a few stretches that help out, and I recommend doing them before you start your session: 

Take a look at this article on the "Third World Squat". It will help you identify what the problem areas are from sitting all day. The problem we see is this: 

Take a look at this link with visual references for body fat percentages. Keep scrolling down for the women. What you want to look like is a personal matter, but those give you a visual reference so you can see when it happens to you. But I do want to drive home one point. Look at the image below (I know it's a man): 

If you eat about four times a day (breakfast, lunch, dinner, snack) or more, it will help you get through the day with a more even temperament. I also recommend getting more calories from vegetables outside your protein source than grains or anything like that. 

The problem in that case is that there is nothing that helps you change and correct for the better in any consistent manner. Some people have gotten more points from eating pizza than climbing stairs. 

My coach had me do something 5/3/1 like for a while and it worked well for me. It was more of a 10/8/5/3 plan, but I can take some principles from that plan and apply it to you: 

Assuming you have the space for it, the barbell can work. And yes, you'll want as short a straight barbell as you can get your hands on. While you are working out the balance issues, use the bar unloaded. Your wrist hasn't had to stabilize something so unwieldy before and the leverages are very different (read, harder). Honestly, using a barbell is not advised for the Turkish get up due to the leverages involved. It would be preferable to get a dumbbell handle you can load with more weight. The pair I have can be loaded to 150 lbs (~67.5kg). 

There are several methods of increasing grip strength, and some of the principles that work the best you should already be familiar with due to the bodybuilding background. First, let's look at what causes grip to fail: 

Don't get overly caught up on feet X position and Y angle, etc. People with longer femurs will need a wider stance, while people with shorter femurs will need a narrower stance. The feet should not be so far apart that your knees are not over your feet when you start going back up. I've found I have a hard time if the feet are too far apart. Conversely, they can't be so close that you are fighting your thighs to get deep enough. A comfortable jump width is a good starting point. Focus on being consistent with every rep. 

Considering the many formulas available for predicting your 1RM (one rep max), the best way to know which is closer for you is to test it at least once. Many intermediate strength programs have a day to test your 1RM built in as part of the program, and you'll be testing it once or twice per program cycle (roughly 12 weeks on average). When you get to the point you want to know for sure what your current 1RM is, you'll need to test it safely. Even if you have three spotters, a dropped barbell can happen so fast that they may not be able to catch it in time. So, proper equipment is necessary: 

There are a few articles on the subject at Juggernaut Training Systems from varied authors. A couple key concepts is that details matter both in training and in nutrition; and recovery through other methods than eating through a plateau is paramount. That means you need to get your sleep and external stress under control. You'll find some of the authors are big proponents of nutrient timing (Nate Winkler), and others not so much. My opinion is that it is just something to experiment with once you've got the main bits on nutrition working. Second, Science: 

These are all very real problems, and it affects women to differing degrees. Some that I've trained with are very affected and others are seemingly slightly affected. For someone who is affected, there are some things they can do: 

You might have some Ferrous Sulfide if cooked too long and kept in the hot water to cool slowly. You also might have some increased risk of salmonella poisoning for the soft boiled eggs. Other than that, I believe the nutritional content is essentially same. See the nutrition of 1oz raw egg and 1oz hard boiled egg. You'll see minor differences in the distribution of fats and cholesterol, but the protein is untouched. 

It sounds like you already had some good progress. Hitting a milestone like that 135 lb bench is a real validation of the work you've put in. You have two questions, but one of them I think you have more concerns with. Relative Strength The concept of equating the effort that a 150 lb young man does with a 230 lb man does is actually a fairly complicated subject. My old coach wrote a very good article on the subject (ref). Some of the high points (quoted) are:
