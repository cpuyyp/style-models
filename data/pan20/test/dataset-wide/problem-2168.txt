It is really a brave issue to brought up. But this is really a matter of high concern. If it had happened for the first time, then you should personally talk to that particular girl(obviously when she is not drunk, you cant afford second one). You should clear some points rearding 

This is a usual scenario in our office. We are a group of 4 trainees seated alongside 3 seniors. we 4 trainees are really good friends . It is usual among us that 2 or 3 of us are involved in conflicting dicsussion. Its been 5 months for us and each time any of us had discussion and if the person sitting quite knows the answer doesnt hesitate much to interrupt the discussion to give their suggestion. But on the other side, if any of our seniors have conversation, even if we know the answer we didn't interrupt them, as long as we are asked to. So i would suggest you to interrupt the X and Y only if you have sound relations with them, otherwise you should wait for them to ask you to answer the topic. Else it will reflects your lack of focus on own work and eye on other's work. 

now what do you want.? the information.? or you want that jackass to not get the information.? either way you are helpless. you cant tell your boss to not share any information with that colleague and also asking your boss to share the same information with you also will not help you much. 

Yes. Simply set up a meeting with both supervisors and ask them who you should be reporting to (and be prepared to hear that you should be reporting to both of them). Ask if you can send out just one update email to both of them instead of two different reports every time, or if all three of you can have a once a week/month/whatever meeting so everyone is caught up to date at the same time. Explain that the less time you have to spend with email, the more time you spend on the project. That said, some managers will still want you to report separately. If that's the case, it's what you'll have to do. Many managers, however, will be thrilled to hear that someone else is handling it, and will say "Just report to person X" This is especially true when one person is a Project Manager while the other is a business manager. 

I would consider it a potential red flag that they're already handing out loads of paperwork and giving short deadlines. Lets face it, medical paperwork is NEVER going to get done in two days; just getting an appointment with a doctor usually takes about a week (unless they're providing you one). From personal experience, the only time I have ever been given that short of a deadline was for a drug test, and that was because they did it on the spot so I wouldn't have time to hide anything. 

I was in the same situation in the college days, but in my case, F was really a close frnd, thus it doesnt mattered that F worked or not as much as we did, but F gave the project presentation for us, in that F was really good. In my case, A always try to be a perfectionist, thus he doesnt likes any of the work done by F. Every time, F tries to mark his presence, A always denies F's work, by saying almost the same words that you said The work F did in 4 weeks, i could have probably done in 2 hours. So you better find out the best part of F(Asking a friend to leave the group is quite rude). Even if you want to do that, do it before its too late for F to get in some other project. Have an honest talk with F or even with the project guide. 

If you are looking to get permanent in the office, you should definitely focus on improving your relationships with your fellow colleagues as well as your seniors. Going to a trip with them is really a good option for this. Also if letting down half day salary is not gonna cost you much, then you should definitely attend the trip. Also, talking to your senior about working for extra hours to make up for the trip time will definitely show your loyalty towards work and also your half day salary would be saved. So you should definitely go to trip and ask your senior to make up for the half day loss by working in extra hours. 

This is something that only the new company or agency can answer. If the agency gave you more time, I'd definitely use it. It might give them a bad impression of you, but if they revoke an offer because of their own ridiculous deadlines, good riddance. (It may not feel that way, but trust me, you don't want to work for a company like that.) 

You have nothing to really lose by doing this since you're already leaving, however it may give your current company a bad impression of you. If you decide to go this route, treat it like a vacation day--schedule it ahead of time, make sure all of your work is in good standing order, and that things won't fall apart just because you're gone. Honestly, it's good practice for when you've left anyway. If you can get the paperwork done in a day, I'd say it isn't a HUGE deal; if it's a week (especially out of a four week notice), it's a much bigger deal. If you absolutely cannot risk losing this new job, this is the better of the two options. 

I would say that it does apply here. If it wasn't in the job advertisement, it's not an automatic deal breaker for you to not know TDD. That being said, it is a deal breaker when a programmer doesn't test their own code. Check for accuracy somewhere, even if it's not explicitly TDD. This will help showcase your creativity and problem solving, and show that you can work around your gaps of knowledge. (Seriously, even a bunch of comments with hand calculations saying "Program spec says y = a + b, so for a = 1 and b = 2, y = 3. Program output matches.") Put something in the program to show you tested it, even if you didn't test it their way. THEN offer to test it their way. Approach it from a "I did this to the best of my ability, however if you gave me greater detail about your TDD methodologies, I would be more than willing to incorporate them." This shows you're eager to learn and assimilate to their culture. Basically, yes, you need some tests... but it isn't because of the employer. It's because every programmer should be testing their code in some way; if you aren't testing it at all, there's a much, MUCH bigger issue at play. If you can't test it with TDD, admit that, tell them what tests you did as a workaround, and offer to do it their way, if they want you to. 

Social Networking sites are blocked in our office. So whenever i am free at work, i usually spend much of my time studying my previous assignments, researching about enhancements in the technology on which i am working upon and most of the time in Stack overflow solving others problem. I think its among the best ways to learn about things. But also, you need to find out the reason, why you are not being assigned work, sometimes these reasons could be severe. 

Thanx to all users, who had given their valuable suggestions. what i had concluded that to boost up my enthusiasm during work, as suggested by @karl beilefeldt 

I am quite new to Office environment, so I am not not much familiar with Workplace etiquettes. Our Lunch timings is from 2 pm to 3 pm. But our seniors are mostly busy doing their project stuff at that time and they mostly leave their seats at about 2:30 for Lunch. But I most of the time leave my seat for lunch at exact 2 pm. 

Bravo.! That's really a brave question. Its a problem that i think many of us should have faced. The question to this is simple. As you have mentioned, there are only 8 or 9 employees in your office, that means your absence in the office will definitely affect the work. Also, you have mentioned that you are feeling quite better and the disease is not much severe and you will be fine in 2 or 3 days, so you might talk to your boss about the disease and ask him to decrease the workload from you. Even working in weekends for completing the work might do the trick. But all depends on how you presents your illness to your boss. but i must say Never Compromise anything for the Sake of you HEALTH 

You can certainly ask for months to consider the offer, however most employers would scoff at that sort of thing. In my experience, managers want an answer as soon as possible so they can start planning your onboarding. What is more common is accepting the offer with a start date that is a while away (this is especially common for students about to graduate). This would, technically, buy you a few months' time and give you the ability to change your mind (or not!) about accepting the offer. Keep in mind that if you accept an offer and then renege, you may end up burning bridges. In my opinion, politely turning down the offer and explaining why you're turning it down is the best bet. This will let the boss know that you did go in with the intent of accepting, and therefore weren't wasting their time. This also opens up the possibility of the boss saying "Well, if your circumstances change, let us know. We'd love to have you on board." 

I feel like a lot of managers might be upset if you bypass all of the hiring procedures to contact them directly; the procedures are in place for a reason, after all. If there's any doubt about whether the position is still open, I'd go through your recruiter. If the position is closed, you've wasted their time by making them read an email about a position that is already filled; if the position is still open, you might have saved the manager time/effort by contacting them directly (they may not want to interview you again, and they can stop interviewing other candidates.) I would go through the recruiter, but I tend to play it safe. 

Its just fine now to shake hands with your employer and go find a new job. Its a usual thing, that you are having a lot of affection at your current job. I guess everyone loves their first job. But you cant put your career at an edge for the sake of I just love my job. You have just started your career and initial years of your career are very important, you should gain good experience in this time. You can get back to them anytime they are upto their funds and if they can afford you at that time. A new job will definitely provide you with some new friends, whom you will not try to loose at that time. 

If this behaviour from that girl had happened before, then you should raise issue in front of higher management. They can handle it very well. As you said There were no witnesses to support my story or security cameras in that area of the building.. I dont think they will completetly deny your statement. because it is really an issue of someone's self respect and no one could raise such kind of issue without any problem(as it is against a girl, who not so usually show these kind of abnormal behaviour, atleast not in workplaces). But take in mind that dont leave this issue unheard. It it happened yesterday, it could happen tomorrow. Dont put your self respect to get hurt. If you will not care about your self respect, then no one else will
