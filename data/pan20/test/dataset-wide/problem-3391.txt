The term is indeed reduplication. That term does not refer just to forms which repeat an existing base word. Reduplication may copy repeat just a syllable, or two syllables, or an entire word, and it frequently happens that only the reduplicated word exists without there being a simpler form. 

Also North Saami: Gákti lea čáppat "The jacket is nice" (čáppat), Dát lea čappa gákti "This is a nice jacket". 

I believe that the ne...pas construction of French is post-Old French so that would be an example. Arabic (not all dialects) developed the negative concord element -š subsequent to earlier written Classical Arabic. 

When you write about that, it might be a good idea to accurately represent the facts of the language. For example, the language doesn't have special genitive case variants for pronouns, like English my, French mon etc. Instead, you just put the 1st person pronoun (or any possessor) before the head noun, as in mí g|à'ásì "my eyes" (1s eyes), dà'á g!ohsì (fire smoke) "the fire's smoke". When the possessor is a noun, possess can optionally be marked with a possessive particle ||'àn plus a pronoun referring to the possessor, as in dà'á ||'àn hì g!ohsì (fire poss. it(fire) smoke) "the fire's smoke". It also turns out that possessive marking is obligatory if the possessor noun is modified by an adjective, so dshàú gèsín ||'àn 'msi (woman other poss she food) "the other woman's food". If supposed "egalitarianism" means that they have no concept of possession, then you would predict that there is no way to say "my eyes" or "the other woman's food", but there is in fact a construction that is specific to expressing the notion of possession. Also, if there were no notion of possession, then there couldn't be a verb dcàá "steal" or a noun dcàákxàò "thief", since all stuff would be jointly owned 

The distinction is generally framed in terms of the notion of "time-invariant computation", whether the output of one computation requires the results from another computation to be available. In a serial derivation, as in the case of a standard pre-OT phonology, it is possible for one rule to apply first, and apply a second rule after that – in a series. Thus the plural "bushes" /bυʃ-z/ → bʊʃɨz to which devoicing cannot apply. You have to know if the vowel is to be inserted, in order to correctly not apply devoicing, which could apply to /bυʃ-z/. The standard account is then to say you first actually do epenthesis, and then do devoicing to whatever results (and insertion of a vowel prevents devoicing of /z/). On the other hand, if a language has a rule of intervocalic voicing and one palatalizing velars before front vowels, the derivation of /iki/ → [igʲi] does not require serial application of the rules, because no information provided by applying one of those rules is part of the information required for the other rule to apply (changing place of articulation by palatalization doesn't affect voicing since voicing doesn't care about place of articulation; voicing doesn't affect palatalization, since palatalization applies to velars regardless of voicing). In that case, we might say that the rules can be applied "in parallel". There actually two views of what that would mean, one being that the two rules literally apply at the same time, the other being that the rules apply one after the other, but it doesn't matter what order they apply in. In classical OT, the computation of stars with respect to a given constraint is independent of the computation of stars for any other constraint. All constraints are evaluated in parallel (can be done at the same time, or in any random order). The potential for seriality arises from the adjudication of a tableau full of stars: if there are two constraints A, B ordered s.t. A precedes B, then {*,**} beats {**,*}. The easiest way to conceptualize this is to process the table of stars serially from left to right, but that isn't how they do it. There is a dense discussion of recursive summing-up of stars in Prince & Smolensky 1993. If you happened to be familiar with signal processing and A-to-D conversion as the simultaneous parallel weighted comparison of voltages, this might make some sense, otherwise I grant that it looks like hand-waving. Classical OT does have serial elements: GEN must precede EVAL, assignment of stars must precede the winnowing of stars. And then there are post-classical developments ("classical" lasted about 4 years) which added a number of serial computations – Sympathy theory (star assignment in one column requires knowledge of all of the stars and the filtering, of a subset of candidates); Output-Output constraints (you have to know the results of the computation of one word before you can determine the star-assignment for another related word). Stratal OT also have multiple cycles of evaluation, so is somewhat serial (imposing an order between levels, but not on the derivation within a level). In fact, "Candidate Chains" cleans all of this mess up, by writing derivational steps left-to-right separates by commas (e.g. deʃʔ,deʃeʔ,deʃe is one candidate, where the last item is what is pronounced. OT-CC essentially abandoned the pretense of meaningful parallelism. 

There are very many opinions of the "meaning" of the letters used to represent PIE reconstructions. One approach treats them as algebraic abstractions, where e.g. bh represents some sound that corresponds to φ in Greek and f in some positions in Latin, and b in English: there is no claim as to phonetic value. The other approach is that these are approximate hypotheses regarding the most likely pronunciation, thus reconstructed m is probably pronounced [m], and so on. Within the latter approach, there can be competing theories, for example some people reconstruct [d] where other people reconstruct [t'], that is there are competing ideas of what the substance of the proto-phonemes are. The strength of the argument for particular phonetic reconstructions varies, so while n is fairly uncontroversial (the reflexes are [n]), gʷʰ depends on sophisticated argumentation, since no language actually directly attests [gʷʰ]. The so-called laryngeals are a particular mystery, since they are preserved in no living though do show up in Hittite (where we don't really know for sure how things were pronounced). The reconstruction of phonetic values is based on overlapping analogies and estimations of phonetic likelihood. For example, gʷʰ (a voiced aspirate labialized velar) is justified by the fact that that sound behaves like other voiced aspirates (is voiced in Germanic and Armenian, not devoiced), and acts like the other labialized velars (kʷ, gʷ) which are better preserved. In other words, the letters represent hypotheses as to pronunciations, though with a certain limit on ability to reconstruct exact phonetics. I don't think there is much hope for reconstructing a very exact phonetic value of r, in light of the very many phonetic kinds of rhotics that exist, and even is one of the laryngeals is "ħ", there are quite a number of phonetic types of ħ in the world's languages, so some questions are probably unresolvable. 

They decided to treat that construction as verb+adverb, not verb+object. Adverbs are derived with -e and singular noun objects are marked with -on. 

There is nothing difficult with the concept: the ratio of X to Y is X/Y. If you want to know the consonant-to-vowel quality ratio of Turkish, you need to know the number of consonants in Turkish, and the number of vowel qualities in Turkish. According to the map and definitions in ch. 1, Turkish has an average number of consonants, defined as 22±3, and a large set of vowel qualities, which is 7-14. Turkish is reported to have an average C/VQ ratio, defined as 2.75 or higher but less than 4.5. Rather than computing such a ratio, you can just look up the ballpark of the ratio. If you want to actually compute an exact number, you have to decide what values you want to assign for C and VQ. The counting criteria are not clearly spelled out in the articles: the procedure is "Long and short variants of the same vowel are always counted once, nasalized vowels do not add to the inventory as long as a non-nasalized counterpart occurs, and so on" (that is, one is free to add similar criteria, if you want). There are in fact 8 vowels in Turkish (though earlier the author reported 9), so that part is not wildly controversial. In some other language, this could be utterly unclear, for example is the English seat / sit distinction a length distinction (some people say so) or a quality distinction (some people say so)? What about phonatory differences in Otomanguean or Nilotic, or tones of Vietnamese (which are a mix of pitch and phonation)? As for the consonant-counting methodology, Ch. 1 states 

As a preliminary matter, "tonal language" encompasses quite a number of prosodic types, and depending on how narrowly you define "tone", you can make tone be a property with a very restricted distribution, by requiring the system to be "like Chinese" (languages that are "like Chinese" are Chinese and some adjacent languages). Otherwise, the geographical distribution of tone is very broad in the world. It is everywhere in Africa south of the Sahara: more specifically, it is lacking in Berber and Semitic. It is found in spots within Indo-European (Lithuanian, Scandinavian, Rhenish West Germanic; a number of languages of India and Pakistan), and in the European languages it is often labeled "pitch accent". It's also in Basque. Ket is the odd case of a northern Aurasian tonal language, otherwise, tone is found throughout east Asia (from India to Japan, China and south, leaving out e.g. Austronesian and some other languages). It's found in New Guinea, North America (Athabascan, Tlingit, and numerous other phyla of North America, especially in Mexico; and in various places in South America that are well north of the equator). Clicks, on the other hand, are limited as a feature of ordinary language to a narrow region of Southern and Eastern Africa. They were borrowed into some Bantu languages, and otherwise exist in the "Khoisan" languages and Dahalo (Cushitic, adjacent to one of the northern Khoisan languages. Khoisan is not, however, a clearly established linguistic unit, and may be a set of typologically similar unrelated languages. The distribution of clicks is such that we can say that clicks are a really rare feature, but seem to be popular enough that if your neighbors have them, you might like to adopt them as well. There are a number of sound-types that fall in the "uncommon" category, such as ejectives, implosives, breathiness and creakiness on vowels (hmmm, these have to do with laryngeal distinctions beyond just plain voicing); also uvulars, pharyngeals, and front round vowels. There is a tendency for sounds to group according to genetic phylum, which basically means that if a proto-language has a certain inventory of sound-types, daughter languages will tend to be more like that proto-language, and they don't randomly innovate masses of new sounds. Thus Austronesian languages are similar in the consonant and vowel systems, and they do not develop complex consonant systems of the type found in Caucasian languages, nor to they tend to develop tone systems. The key is "tend", so indeed there are a handful of tonal Austronesian languages, such as Yabem, Ma'ya and Matbat. Indo-Aryan languages tend not to be tonal, but there are some languages in the northern IA are that have developed tone (all, as far as I know, from earlier consonant distinctions). My conclusion is that the geographical distribution of tone is due to the fact that tone is a less-common linguistic feature and is unlikely to just emerge from nothing. With sociolinguistic encouragement (if your neighbors speak tonally), you might dispose of some sound-structure feature (typically something about consonant phonation) and replace it with a related tonal feature. But this is unlikely in languages such as Hawaiian, Fijian, first because they don't have tonal neighbors that they may be inclined to sound like and second, because they have really simple consonant systems, and no fodder for creating tone from some other source. Tone distribution is governed by historical facts about the structure of the earlier languages, and contact facts. Click, on the other hand, are just plain weird, and it's a mircle that any language has them.
