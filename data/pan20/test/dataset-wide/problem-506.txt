If you want to use tape, then you want to use what's commonly called "helicopter tape" (or "racing tape" or "repair tape") by car customizers. It looks like transparent packing tape but is much stronger. The story goes that the tape was used to cover the leading edge of helicopter blades to protect them. So it's tough, waterproof, and won't easily peel. And when you do have to peel it off, it comes off relatively cleanly (the remainder cleans up with GooGone or similar removal liquid). That said, you need to be careful of what you're covering. Even with helicopter tape, some moisture always finds a way of getting underneath into the paper so it should be printed with waterproof ink. And UV light will also fade. So you generally shouldn't just use something that's coming out of your home inkjet printer. 

Finding statistics is extremely difficult, but one set of data was located from the Chicago Stolen Bike Registry $URL$ Their statistics page ($URL$ is now dead/404-ed but if you go to the WaybackMachine, you can get archived data from September 2012. And tada! 

Japan has relatively modest vehicle emission regulations - certainly not to EU standards. The worst that I experienced is diesel soot from buses and trucks. Luckily, rural Japan has depopulated to the extent that you can generally route in a way to avoid traffic. As far as tunnels go... For shorter tunnels, there's not much you can do except hold your breath if you're in a tunnel with a truck or bus. Or wait until the fumes dissipate. Longer tunnels in Japan have forced ventilation. They should have sensors that detect the air quality and spin up turbines to force air through them if the quality is low. 

Almost all (99%) of bicycle "dynamos" are in fact AC alternators and they produce alternating current (3~6 VAC) with a current limiter (usually 1A max). The frequency of the AC varies by speed. Most dynamos tie one of the output legs to frame ground (neutral). The dynamo manual will tell you which, but if you don't have the manual you have to figure this out. Some will only have one output and this is the 'hot' side with the frame serving as 'neutral'. Most dynamo lights take both AC or DC input. The LEDs internally rectify it to DC. Most dynamo lights have one of the input legs tied to frame ground (neutral). The manual will specify which, but you can also test it out yourself. 

Almost all derailleurs seem to come from the factory with nylon jockey wheels . What is the rationale for the use of nylon (rather than alloy or aluminum)? Is it merely weight savings (which would seem to be trivial given the size) or is there a functional advantage to nylon/plastic? 

You have two parts that you need to replace - the tow bar and the hitch mount. Tow Bar Fixing the tow bar is pretty easy. You just need a piece of steel tubing that is just a little bit larger or smaller in diameter than the existing tubing so that it'll fit like a sleeve - then bolt or rivet them together. If you aren't carrying kids or animals in the trailer, a solid piece of hardwood doweling would also work. A good hardware store will have tubing repair clamps that could also work (I'd still drill safety pins/rivets in it to make sure that longitudinal forces don't pull it apart): 

If both fail, then you have to go with brute force. An angle grinder is the easiest way to get a D lock off, especially a well-built one like the Abus which uses hardened steel. Fortunately, one leg is free so you only need to cut the other leg off (otherwise, you'd have to make two cuts): 

You really can’t change it that much. A dual-suspension downhill mtb will always have limitations, most notably its weight, wheel size and width, and geometry. Instead, get a used, 1970s, steel, road bike for your commute. It should cost you roughly $50-150 euros or dollars. You’ll be amazed at how light a road bike (even a steel antique) will feel compared to a mountain bike. My 1975 Peugeot MX-18 weighs just under 11kg (I did swap the steel rims for alu ones). This is half the weight of your mountain bike! A road bike, even an old one, will be faster over paved surfaces and learning how to “float” over cobblestones and rough surfaces will help your mountain biking skills. Finally, since a used beater is so cheap, you won’t worry as much riding it in all weather conditions or about bike thievery. 

Can I go up a rotor size? What would limit this? My fork has a brand but the manufacturer's website has no indication of rotor size limitation. Is there any advantage to going up? 

So for troubleshooting, I'd first see if your lever can flip the other way. Then, I'd ensure the tire valve is fully seated (pushed in all the way and maybe give it a wriggle as you push it in). Then I'd try putting the other type of valve (presta or schrader) in to see if the switching mechanism can't reset. Finally, I'd gently prove with the blunt end of a disposable chopsticks inside the sides and end of the valve body to see if you can't locate and unstick the switching mechanism. This all assumes you can't find the manual which would tell you specifically what to do. I find the cheaper dual head designs to be failure prone, I prefer pumps with single "universal" heads such as this Lezyne. 

Another option -- if you don't mind making the bike inauthentic -- is to change to 700c wheels with a 7-8-9 freewheel or cassette. Since you have a rear hub spacing of 126mm, it would require expanding the frame to fit a 135mm hub. I did this with my 1975 Peugeot UO18 to turn it from a 2x5 into a 2x9 speed (actually 2x8, as the frame interferes with the smallest cog). Even losing the smallest cog, I expanded my rear cogs from 14-26 five speed to an effective 13-34 on the rear. Made going up hills so much easier! Several caveats and thoughts: 

If you mean these things, they’re called cable ferrules — or more specifically, brake (cable) ferrules. Some people also call them cable ends or cable caps. 

As for your particular tire, I agree the Slickasaurus have ambiguous markings. The manufacturer's website doesn't give any information so I took this screen grab off Amazon for a Slickasaurus tire that shows "700 x 35c (35/32)". My reading of this is that it fits on 700c rims normally designed for a 35mm tire width (that is, the wire bead is close to that of a 35mm), but because it's a slick tire, the actual tread width is closer to what a 32mm tire would have. For your old tire, it means that it nominally fits rims designed for tires that have a wire bead profile closer to a 37mm tire's wire bead but in actuality has a tread profile closer to a 32mm profile. 

Generally you'd take the fender off a bike, put it on an anvil, find the right place on the horn of the anvil that matches the radius of the curve, and bang out the ding. Then you'd buff out any scratches or rechrome it. 

included for historical reasons: My first guess before you posted the photo was that the handle bars twisted so that they are no longer perpendicular to the wheel. 

It's a tiny bolt (maybe only around 5-6mm across) so drilling it out and getting a screw extractor in might be a bit tough. You might consider using a dremel rotary tool with a thin drill or abrasive diamond bit. You want to drill a small hole in the center to get the screw extractor in -- or perhaps more realistically a straight trough into which you can fit a flathead screwdriver so that you can unscrew the bolt. 

Why bother? It's much easier/cheaper/faster to get a replacement stem that can accommodate contemporary handlebar diameters. I replaced the AVA stem (nicknamed the "Death Stem" by Sheldon Brown in the link on Batman's answer) on my 1970s Peugot with a Velo-Orange stem and bars. What you need is this: Velo Orange Threadless Stem Adapter (ST-0001; $16) -- this will allow you to use any modern set of bars with your old forks.
