We, the Hrimfaxi, an extensive interstellar empire, are invading the Earth! However, these pesky humans have proved themselves to be extremely good at pouring out dakka and making things go kaboom. Despite the technological advantages the we had during the first days of the invasion, they seemed to be adapting and dragging the ground war on and on. So why shouldn't I, the commander of the invasion just claim Earth a lost cause and declare Exterminatus? After all, Earth is just one small planet in the entire galaxy. Invading Forces: My space forces consists of a rather small flotilla of space ships armed with weapons on the equivalent of Earth's strategic nuclear weapons, enough to make Reagan and Gorbachev blush. I have a small shipyard in the solar system so I can procure more as I needed. My soldiers, on the other hand, are cloned, mindless drones, controlled by me through a psychic chain of command. Commanders like me have free will, while sub-commanders further down the chain have decreasing levels of free will. They are organized fairly conventionally: infantry, armor, artillery, air force, etc. I have cloning tanks at my disposal to replenish losses. Operational Objectives Standard expansion of Hrimfaxi sphere of influence and adding humans to the collective psychic network of Hrimfaxi systems. Secondary objectives include cataloging the genetic properties of life on earth, with is largely complete through abductions. The reasons are so buried underneath bureaucracy, ancient history, and indoctrination that most Hrimfaxi don't even know why they are invading other worlds other than they must or their superiors will have them executed. In fact, it is highly debatable if the higher spheres of the bureaucracy psychic network can be even fathomed under the mindset of an individual being. 

In a world where torch ships sometimes will accelerate over 10Gs for hours, maybe sometimes days on end. Is there any way to keep the crew alive and preferably fully functional in during such harsh maneuvering, or do we have to result to handwaves such as "inertial dampening" or human augmentation? 

What kinds of chemical warfare agents would be possible to synthesize and store (including binary ones, which are two precursors mixed during or immediately before firing) at an industrial scale with Napoleonic Era technology? Assuming the method of synthesizing the chemical agents are already known. Also, would Napoleonic artillery be capable of dispensing lethal chemical agents without killing the gun crews? 

I've been playing a lot of Deserts of Kharak lately, and I am wondering if landships depicted in game, which are essentially seagoing ships on tracks, would work in a Snowball Earth scenario. By Snowball Earth, I am using the classic Snowball Earth scenario, where all of the oceans are frozen, and the equatorial regions have temperatures of around modern-day Antarctica. So would landships be a preferred method of transporting bulk cargo from one place to another in a snowball earth, say, compared to airlift? What challenges might a landship that runs on tracks or wheels might face on the glaciers other than structural issues of building such a titanic vehicle in the first place? 

I am making the assumption that the AI allied with the defenders is a "strong" AI, and does not have any qualms about killing humans. A machine shop may very well churn out firearms, but you will need ammunition to feed them. Making a lot of AKs or Sten Guns definitely would be possible, assuming somehow they can get ammunition for them. Even if they lack ready ammunition, other weapons can be built to rapidly arm people. Because of the machine shop is in the town, machine out a very good spring and mount it to a stock and you have a cross bow, and other close-combat weapons can also be easily fabricated. Since this is a infrastructure development project, there is bound to be a lot of petrochemicals laying around. Hook a tank of combustible liquid or gas to a pressurized gas tank and you have yourself a flame thrower. Even better, if the AI has the proper formulae stored, explosives definitely would be a good option. A well-planted field of various mines and booby traps can hold up the attackers for quite some time. If the situation becomes desperate enough, you may consider synthesizing chemical weapons from the available raw stocks. Quite a few lethal and weaponizable chemicals can be produced from relatively simple ingredients, although this is not a recommended option, because of political backslash and the need to limit fratricide and collateral damage. Because the locals are untrained, I would rather not trust the battles to them. You have an AI, after all. If it is possible to manufacture electronics, I would recommend building and programming combat drones, slaved to the AI, to take out the attackers and gather intelligence. They can be as simple as quadcopters with a bomb strapped to it, or can be scaled up to remotely-piloted tankettes or AI-directed gun turrets. They can serve a further psychological blow to the sub-Saharan warlord, who may not be used to fighting unmanned combat systems. Even outside the battlefield, the AI could shine. Assuming the AI has sufficiently powerful backers, the AI can simply phone home to request things like satellite footage, or rally political sentiments to the defender's favor, which may allow further aid from outside. All and all, since the defenders have an AI on their side, they might as well as put it to good use. It is the age of information warfare, after all, and the AI is probably much more suited to modern war than the army of the warlord. 

Aristocracy = Form of government which places power in the hands of a small, privileged ruling class. It's contrasted with democracy or monarchy. Post-scarcity society = I take it here, that you mean, that all usual needs are more of less fullfilled (and guaranteed). Materially, all inhabitants of your world, are equipped very similar. (Otherwise there would be some scarcity.) This means, there is no tangible privileged class really. There cannot be. If nothing is scarce, everyone can have everything. What government will this society have and why? You didn't say anything about it. Will it be a democracy? Or a tyranny? Or what will be it be? Will there be wars maybe? What about nations? From the definitions above you see that aristocracy is a form of government and post-scarcity is a technological, resource, infrastructure thing. Both seems to be pretty independent from each other. My guess: People will still favor certain other people based on family ties, appearance (color of skin for example), manner of speaking, ... and depending on the political system this will results in different groups which even in a democracy would fight against each other. The majority party could oppress the minority. One way (the most direct) to oppress someone might be to threaten to kill him if he disobeys. Or does post-scarcity mean that you cannot kill anyone? 

A poison typically works independent on whether you know about it or not. If it shall only work if you know about it, it would have to be able to literally read the mind (nocebo effects or cheating by faking the poisoning and then waiting for the person to make a mistake are not very specific and might easily fail). The usual chemical compounds cannot do that, so either you have to use advanced technology (like the nanorobots of Anders Gustafsons answer) or magic. A magical solution could for example be: 

It's hard to imagine entities like the European Union to found a new nation, because it would rather want to integrate than to split up but I guess if they wanted to it would rather choose a bureaucratic approach maybe with an acronym. Something like: 

For all we know: Yes. I shamelessly copy from two comments below the question by user6760 and bon. For the birth gravitation is usually helpful in assisting the pushing force of the contractions. Many women stand or sit during the birth. However, it is conceivable that even without gravitation there is enough force to push the baby out of the uterus. In the same way one could also help and create artificial pull by applying a suction cup to the head of the baby and pull. Or one could apply a C-section which would eliminate the need for gravitation at all during birth. Rotating elements creating artificial gravitation similar to our gravitation level are feasible. During infinite space travel you don't have to do without gravitation. In the absence of friction with the surrounding space, such a rotation could be maintained very efficiently. Centrifugal forces are exactly the same as gravitational forces. Regarding the endurance of the construction towards rotation, please note that space vehicles have to endure a multiple of that force during launch and they do. An infinitely traveling human space race surely would replace weak parts over time with newer parts to hold it all together. And even if for most of the time you would life in low-G environments, by doing sports in this environment (pushing against each other, ...) one could keep the muscles trained. For the skeleton it may indeed by bad in the long run. We don't have reliable long term information about that. The human race living in low-G might indeed evolve different (less upright). Maybe modern medicine (the technology of today to tomorrow) could strengthen the bones artificially (increased calcium uptake,...). 

They can never be sure about that. After all what are the chances that there is another solar system with some planets and a brighter sun and no artificial traces of a past civilization, totally different star patterns and cat-like species (as you describe it). It could be that in one of the hundreds of millions other stars in one of the million other galaxies this will be the case in 600 million years. Getting the time right might not be a problem, we measure the age of the universe already now (with some error) as 13.8 billion years, so maybe it could then be measured again as 14.4 billion years. But being certain about the location, that would require some statistical estimation of how unique our solar system is currently, how quickly that changes and then how significant the reasoning is that if you see certain species and fossils that it can only have been earth. It all depends on how unique we are and we don't know that. The best idea would probably to colonize the new planet and then spread out to find something that resembles the original earth more. If you don't find anything, you can still think you are on the original earth, but you may not be sure about it. In principle if we map enough stars and galaxies and have precise enough informations about their evolutions for the next 600 billion years we might have enough evidence to conclude we are still on earth, but I doubt that. 

The easiest way by far is creating unrest, acting unfair, opressing independent minds, favoring a particular subpopulation without good reason, .... And then, when unrest boils over, send in the mighty army (you had to) to keep the peace (killing some along the lines and getting lots of real life training "for free"). A tyranny with an emporer on top might be a good political framework for this kind. Nobody needs to know that the leaders of the freedom fighters are secret agents of the government and that the outdated weapons they use came from the government too. One rebellion every 10 years in some part of the world that is then suppressed bloodily by the army should be doable.
