Honestly this has more to do with how you let your bike "float" underneath you over obstructions than it does with rear suspension or the lack thereof. Since you can potentially go faster on a full suspension over rough terrain than you can on a hardtail I would say you're just as likely to get pinch flats. You just have to unweight the back of the bike and stay loose as you cross rocks/roots/whatever. That's a crucial key not only in reducing pinch flats, but in going faster over technical terrain as well. Short answer, just as likely on either platform depending on your riding style. 

Fork specs clearly say peload and lockout despite your claim that it has neither. However, looking at the image, I only see preload knobs. Not sure where the mechanical lockout lever is... So I have two guesses either A)it's locked out and the lockout knob is not very obvious, or B)The fork is inexpensive and stiff and therefore you are not experiencing any "sag" (The compression to ~75% when the fork is loaded with your weight). The perception of lack of sag is likely exaggerated by the fact that the fork only has 50mm of travel. As you get into mid priced forks, most start at 80-100mm of travel. 

No EBB, vertical dropouts, and 130mm spacing in the rear. You have a few options. Here they are, from worst to best, and most likely cheapest to most expensive. 

Along with the Park Tool book that mikes mentioned, Lennard Zinn has several books and DVDs that are available through his website. He's a trusted name in the industry and usually knows what he's talking about. If you need more immediate help I would take a look at both eHow (originally I was going to say ExpertVillage.com but eHow seems to have absorbed them) and YouTube. Both sites have good videos on all facets of bike maintenance. I like to harp about local bike shops, so here's my plug for yours - lots of shops will let you watch and tell you what they're doing while they work on your bike, especially this time of year when they're slow (approaching winter in the northern hemisphere). You can't ask a book or a video questions, so find a good mechanic at a good shop and ask them if you can watch while they do a tune up/derailleur adjust/brake adjust/ whatever. It's a little more on the rare side, but some shops even offer repair clinics. Just check around with the shops near you and see what you find. 

It would be easy to mistake an Italian BB for an English one (or the other way around) as the drive side cup would thread in fine and the width is very similar. Once you get to the non drive side is where you would run into trouble, which matches up pretty well with the problem you described. 

Without it, the dropout is indeed too thin and your spacing is messed up, not to mention that the strength of the dropout is decreased. You need to identify the correct replacement hanger and get it fixed. Also, I don't know what IGH you're using, but it will most likely require some sort of chain tensioner as well, and without sliding dropouts or an Eccentric Bottom Bracket, you're probably going to need a spring-based chain tensioner that will bolt on to the derailleur hanger: 

Once a pedal comes loose enough to fall out of a crankarm the damage is typically done. The act of the pedal slowly coming loose wallows out the threads of the crankarm, especially the outermost threads. This makes it more susceptible to happening again. If you put it back on tight and it fell out again, it's almost certain that the crank is shot and you'll need to replace it. 

No. Freewheels that small use a smaller diameter thread intended for BMX hubs. The smallest freewheel you're going to find for that hub is a 15T. I believe ACS makes one in 15T called Claws that fits a standard hub. Cheap and it works. 

A combination of practicality and aesthetics. Which direction it leans depends on the frame and routing scheme. 

Very inexpensive rebranded bike with very inexpensive tires which you can't source individually. Nothing wrong with that given that it's a child's bike, but that is the situation. Your chances of finding that exact tire are slim, and there's no really compelling reason for you to hunt it down anyway. The product you can get off the shelf is going to be at least as good and likely better. There's no issue with mixing and matching different tread patterns front and rear beyond aesthetics. 

Titec used to make a cheaper aluminum version, but it's been discontinued. You can probably still find them on eBay. 

Yes- structural integrity and your own well being. 4mm is a lot of metal to remove in the scheme of things. If I were you I would be looking for a long reach brake caliper instead of modifying the dropout by removing material. 

Is it possible that you bought an Italian threaded bottom bracket for an English shell or vice versa? For the two scenarios above, compare the two cups of each bottom bracket to themselves (ie old to old, new to new) by placing them outside down on a flat surface. Now look at the threads. Do they pitch in the same direction or opposite? If the threads pitch in opposite directions then you have an English bottom bracket, which is more common. If they pitch in the same direction, you have an Italian bottom bracket, which is less common, but can be mistaken for English as the drive side cup has the same pitch and TPI as an English drive side cup- the width is just a little different. Here's the best ASCII diagram I can muster: 

In general, road cranks are lighter because they use less material than mtb cranks. Mtb cranks use more material so they can handle more abuse. Compatibility aside, I would be cautious in using road cranks for much more than cyclocross duty. You may never have a problem, but do you really want to find out the hard way? 

Most bike shops hang a substantial portion of their inventory and repairs upside down to save space. I'm not aware of a fork that cannot be stored upside down. As pointed out by DWGKNZ, forks with degraded seals and wipers may be more prone to leaking since the oil is up against them and gravity + capillary action are at work. Some forks with fancy valving may take a little while to get back to normal, for instance some of the Specialized Brain shocks take a while for the platform to behave properly again after being stored inverted. 

It's almost certainly stickered if it's a cheap bike, plus laser etching is usually reserved for bare metal frames - Titanium in particular. Cheap or not, it's still probably got a clear coat over it, and that sticker is almost certainly underneath the clear coat. Unless you're prepared to strip it down to raw metal, prime it, and paint it, you're probably better of just leaving it as it is - especially if it's a cheapie. 

It sounds like you should be waiting for the pedestrian light most, if not all of the time, but use your own best judgment.
