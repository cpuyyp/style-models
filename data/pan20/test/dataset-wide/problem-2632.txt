Although a counter-example for the given concrete argument is difficult, one can easily create a counter-example that shows that the general reasoning is invalid. Let's postulate a brand of playing balls, called JJ. This company makes rubber balls, which are red, and lead balls, which are black. They sell millions of rubber balls each year, but only a handful of lead balls. Those who buy a lead ball generally also buy a large number of rubber balls. 

"Don't believe" can have at least two meanings other than believing the negation. First you might have no evidence, i.e. don't know: "The color of Napoleon's horse was white. Yes, No, Don't know?" Secondly, the question or statement might be such that even "don't know" would be incorrect or highly misleading. E.g. the classic "You have stopped beating your wife." is in this category. A possible answer/opinion might then be then be the Zen "Mu", which is in the direction of having no opinion (not even "don't know"), or unasking the question. 

I think it gets more interesting when we know the patterns that will emerge, and where these patterns are the thoughts of a machine intelligence, recreated by starting with a particular recorded state, and applying recorded inputs and forward evolution. This can be viewed as just a simple way to force the electronics to certain predetermined, known states, but it is the same going on as in an original context where we recorded the state and input signals. And in that original context, we were certain that there was a mind. And instead of asking about the existence of the patterns, in abstract mathematical or physical sense, we can ask about the existence of the mind here: it existed earlier, in some sense of "existing", and with now exactly the same going on in the machinery, except that we know that state evolution and are effectively imposing it, is the mind's "existence" re-created? I would tend to say yes wrt. to the inputs being applied, but this is a hard one. 

Consider that you're not the same person as you were as of 4 years old. But then, you are the same person as you were 2 minutes ago. Clearly there is a gradual change involved, a history. As far as I know the law doesn't make such a distinction, but rather regards the physical body as a person, and judges it differently based on physical age. This is difficult for a common sense notion of sameness of self. There's no abrubt transition from 14 to 14.000001 years, say, even if the law in some country would treat one's actions differently at these ages. The more philosophical questions lurking here do not, in my humble opinion, have to do much with the gradual evolution of a self, which is obvious to me and I think to any clear thinking person (not implying that I'm one, though I like to think that I was ;-) ). Rather it has to do with what happens with more wholesale direct replacements of parts of self, like today we can replace a physical body part, like the heart. And it has to do with copying of self, and perhaps destruction of such copies, and so on. There is perhaps a connection to notions of different self when under the influence of drugs, hypnotics or undue pressure. One will need some very clear minded views on that in order to put in place useful legislation for the future, for the time (in say 40 years) when we will coexist with machine intelligences. It could be a fertile and useful area for philosophers to focus on. However, I suspect it will not happen. :( 

I think the distinction between discovered and invented is mostly about how one chooses to define these words. My personal definition would be that when you can reasonably assume that many other people can in principle find the same thing X, then X can reasonably be said to be discovered, but when X is pretty arbitrary, like a particular notation, then it's invented. For example, different people can discover the Mandelbrot set, and various relationships and figures in there: 

You can make a good start on proving that reality is simulation, by doing certain physics and possibly astronomy (1)experiments that would force the simulator to expend ridiculously high resources to maintain consistency. But then the simulator, if it has (2)snooping ability, can just restart from an earlier time with some slight variation, where these experiments would hopefully (for him/her/it) not occur. I.e., you can't even in principle successfully battle simulator's censorship. Still, (3)science fiction stories have been written about people doing exactly that, battling the simulator more or less successfully, such as Vernor Vinge's “The cookie Monster”. Informally, I find that the presentation of the story as pure text with arbitrary emphasis added, makes it hard to read. One does not perceive the structure of the piece without actually reading all of it: it's not easily accessible! Let it be more formally stated, though, that Vinge's references to Usenet communications and a galaxy filled with Norwegian names, in some of his books, makes him an author to be trusted. For it is obviously true that the galaxy will end up with lots of Norwegians and an old Usenet-like communications network, and still Vernor Vinge's the only author who has described it that way. There is another way of viewing this, however. One can take the idea of cosmic censorship and say that it indicates a simulation, i.e. that it's likely a manifestation of just simulator's censorship. But as I see it that's purely nonsense associative reasoning, for cosmic censorship is about logical consistency, not about the computational cost of consistency. Yes, I know, this answer's a collection of rambling thoughts & associations. But IMHO that's the best you can get: attempts at reasoning more clearly about this can, I think, be dismissed out of hand, for it that was possible, then it would have been well known. 

Regarding the lecturer's “replacing 'guNs' with 'guMs'”, that's a fallacy. It ignores the connection between guns and outlaws, a connection that's not there for oranges or TV sets. That said, that fallacy in the attempted disproof does not make the original argument less fallacious. A main problem with the original argument is that “outlaws” is used in two different senses: before the ban on guns, and after the ban of guns (where it's a much larger set). I.e. the original argument uses equivocation to deceive. That's not the only problem, but it's enough to dismiss it as a concrete argument. However, on the third and gripping hand, we presently have a very important case of the general form of that argument, to deal with: 

The only problem is in the use of the word “exist”. It has many meanings. Existence of a mathematical constraint on an abstract system, is not the same as physical existence in our universe. In the former sense the patterns exist but not at any time, it is a timeless existence. In the second sense the patterns demonstrably do not exist (physically), of course assuming that they indeed do not exist (you forgot to say anything about that). 

I think it's eminently possible to deal with modern mathematics while believing that infinity does not exist. Technically, if the belief had to be applied in one's mathematical considerations, then it would quickly lead to self-contradictions and nonsense results. But just as a religious person who believes that everything happens according to some god's or gods' will, can go on making decisions, caring for others etc., so a person who disbelieves the existence of infinity, or for that matter multiplication, whatever, can go on doing math as if those things existed, just disbelieving that they really exist. It's a matter of a little double-think, a context-dependent suspension of belief/disbelief in at least one part of the mind. We're good at double-thinking. Even a person who doesn't harbor any great irrational beliefs like those mentioned above, have to double-think on occasion, because it's physically impossible to always have consistent beliefs about everything. And sometimes one discovers, through the consequences of one's beliefs, that one harbors two or more mutually contradictory beliefs – double-think to the rescue! Looking at that the other way, it's physically impossible to be sure that all one's beliefs are consistent because it would require arbitrary high processing capacity to deduce the relevant consequences where one can see directly that they clash. So, double-thinking it is, if one is not be stopped by such happenings, which could be seriously detrimental to one's continued existence. And having evolved to accommodate contradictory beliefs, we (apparently) do it quite easily. 

A good way to think about this could be to think about groups (sets) as denoted by example objects, so that “A white horse is Spanish“ means “Any white horse is Spanish”. If A sasy that “A white horse is Spanish“ and then B says that “No, a white horse is Portuguese.”, then they’re most likely not talking about two different arbitrary white horses, but about any white horse that one might choose. 

It depends very much on what you mean by “can be reduced”. In the sense of one level being a theoretical consequence of another level, sure, chemistry is already ~100% reduced to physics: chemical bonds are just sharing of electrons, and they are likely or not depending on the properties of the atoms, in particular the permitted electron energy levels (quantum physics, i.e. you need quantum physics for this particular reduction). But in the sense of practical predictions, the distance between these abstraction levels is too great. It's the old discovery that even almost trivially simple systems can exhibit unlimited complexity. For example, it has been proved that an exceedingly simple 2-state 3-symbol Turing machine is universal, i.e. that it can do any arbitrarily complex computation. As a more simple physical example, while the behavior of two gravitationally attracted bodies in empty space can be practically predicted to any desired degree of accuracy, arbitrarily far into the future, the behavior of three bodies, called the three body problem, is in practice not predictable. Still, they just follow simple physical law: it's the emerging behavior that's so complex, so exponentially dependent on small variations, that it's effectively not predictable. The odd thing about complex behavior is that we often can see large scale patterns in it, and then make probabilistic (statistical) predictions at that level: higher level laws. This is how chemistry emerges at a higher level of abstraction than physics, and how climate emerges at a higher level of abstraction than weather (which in turn, and so on).
