In one of the Poirot books he mentions that though clues are often small he once found a four-foot long one. Unfortunately I can't remember in which book he mentions this. Does anyone know which book he did find the four-foot long clue in? 

I don't believe the men are actually 'forced out' or mysteriously disappear. This line (I believe) refers to Gentlemen in the social life of the class focused on in Cranford. These men do not then actually have to be gone to have 'disappered' they just have to be socially inactive or unimportant. As most of the women are elderly it is likely that most of the men have died off (naturally) as at that time it was quite common for men to marry younger women (and so they often passed away before their spouses). If meomory serves me Cranford is a sort of retirement area, few young people (of the class focused on) live there and so this explanation seems the most likely to me, especially as time stretchs in Cranford and the men may take a year or more to 'disapper', and still be thought to do so. They may also simply suffer from some age-related illness and so not 'go out' and thus not be seen in social life. Added to this, as I understand it, the women simply dominate. The men in the town do not really participate in social life because it is a women dominated area and the younger ones probably do soon leave to find better prospects. The older healthy Gentlemen probably go off to their club, or stay with friends frequently because their is not much social life for them in Cranford and so are not seen much. While their wives are seen because they do enjoy the social life in Cranford. 

If "To Autumn" were merely a pretty description of the season, it wouldn't be considered a great poem. In fact, to read it as a straightforward celebration is to fall into the same trap as the bees in the first stanza: 

(p. 89) Genung argues that the first cycle focuses on the past: on memories of good times with Hallam that can never be relived. The second cycle focuses on the present: on the community of friends and on enjoyments that Hallam would have been a part of had he been alive. The final cycle focuses on the future: on the renewal of that community and its evolution into a higher force. A reading of the three Christmas celebrations does demonstrate an overall trajectory from sorrow to resignation. In the first one, Section XXVIII, Tennyson describes his despair on hearing Christmas bells: 

The same 'Guardian Newspaper - notes and queries' page contains an extended quote from John Fisher's The Magic of Lewis Carroll. 

Out-of-universe it's fairly obviously a writing error, perhaps one that will be corrected in a future edition. 

The (error?) tobacco reference is also found in my (eBook) copy. In-universe there are a few possible options. ". Presumably it's mixed with something else, possibly chocolate. John is extremely surprised to see the Professor. Perhaps in his haste and shock he simply misspoke, mistaking cinnamon for chocolate. 

Orwell explicitly stated that the story of Animal Farm was a retelling of the Russian Revolution. Since the farm represents the "Russian Imperial Regime", by extension Farmer Jones is therefore Czar Nicholas II, which logically suggests that his wife, Mrs Jones is acting the part of Alexandra Feodorovna, Tsarina of Russia. 

Yes, the books are related and are intended to be read in order. In Search of Lost Time is one work in seven volumes. Each volume is not an independent work. Rather, the novel is a developing story; the narrator is relating events from his life, and each volume furthers the narrative. Outside of specialized research or publication/translation contexts, it is rare to find the individual volumes being treated singly. The English Wikipedia, for example, does not even have separate entries for each volume. (The French one, however, does.) It is true that some sections of the narrative are relatively self-contained. For example, Roger Shattuck points out: 

This is a classic example of what Gayle Rubin, in her celebrated 1975 essay of the same title, called "the traffic in women": a man gives his daughter or sister as a gift to another man, so as to augment the status of both men as well as maintain the social economy. The woman in this scenario is property. Before her marriage, she belongs to her father or brother; after, to her husband. Sexual fidelity was de rigeur for Greek women because adultery allowed another man access to the husband's property; and this raises the further, more threatening possibility that the children who inherit that property may not be his own. This would destroy the social economy entirely. This role of women would explain why, as Coontz mentions, marriage based on love would be considered "a serious threat to social order". Marriage was the means by which social bonds were consolidated, status maintained, property acquired, and its orderly transfer ensured. Erotic love cares about none of those things, being based on individual desire rather than social needs. So it had no place in marriage. Erotic life among the Greeks If marriage was not for the fulfillment of sexual desire, then it is understandable that, as we saw earlier, men formed erotic relationships "elsewhere". Where was that? Rauh lists three outlets for men's sexual energies (quote has been edited for length): 

Montag committed at least one lapse prior to meeting Clarisse, about a year earlier when he encountered an old man in the park. In addition to listening to a poetry reading (not in and of itself a crime, but certainly considered aberrant behaviour) he failed to search the Professor despite being confident that he'd find a book of poetry on the man. 

Of course, that book tells the story of how the animals rebel against the farmer who runs their farm -- the Russian imperial regime -- how they establish a revolution, and how the revolution is then gradually subverted into a new class system in which the pigs, who are the brains of the outfit, become a new, tyrannical ruling class. And the animals find themselves in just as bad a situation as they were in before. "1984: An Interview with George Orwell" 

Unlike, say, Dolly's stutter (an unfortunate affliction) or Stuffy's greediness (the result of parental overindulgence), the flaws that Jack and Ned have are seen as something wrong with their character, as moral failings. Nothing in the course of Little Men changes that assessment or causes us to feel sympathy for them. For example, Jack steals Tommy's money, and is perfectly happy to let Nat bear the burden of suspicion; when Ned grudgingly begins to accept that Nat might not be the thief after all, he bullies Nat to try and get at the truth. Alcott does show that each boy has his virtues as well. Jack does eventually confess to the theft and try to atone; Ned does treat Nan with disinterested affection. But for all that, neither Jack nor Ned form any significant connections with their fellow students at Plumfield. Every other boy or girl has at least one close attachment: Dan with Nat, Demi with Daisy, Tommy with Nan, Dick with Dolly, and so on. Through such attachments, the students become part of the larger Plumfield community and show the success of the school's methods. Jack and Ned evidently haven't formed any such bonds with the community. Their careers after Plumfield show that their inherent nature is the same. Jack is still "money-loving"; he is a businessman "bent on getting rich". And Ned is a lawyer; nuff said. Joking apart, the reason they are "failures" is precisely that "no one mourned their absence". Unlike the other boys (and random girl or two) of Plumfield, Jack and Ned have not made themselves part of the place. So when Nat is on the verge of departure for the untamed wilds of Europe (let us remember what a barbarian place it was in the 19th century, especially when seen from the vantage point of the high culture and civilization then prevalent in America), the rest of the community gathers to wish him farewell; Jack and Ned are not connected enough to feel drawn to participate, and worse, nobody cares that they aren't part of the gathering. Is there a greater indication of failure in life than that your presence or absence makes no difference to anybody?

As regards the final book (terminating the series) it would appear that the author wasn't especially pleased with it either. 

KA Applegate did a Reddit IAMA session in 2001. The implication seems to be that her decision to stop writing the Everworld novels was driven by dramatically declining sales figures compared to the large commitment required to generate new novels. 

The riddle has no (canonical) solution. The author, after having been repeatedly questioned on the subject for nearly two years after the original work was published, eventually came up with an answer for the updated edition which they included in the preface, reproduced below from the 150th Anniversary edition. Note that there is no answer, merely one that the author devised post-facto 

The point here is that although we think of mirrors as neutral and exact, they are freighted with emotion, because of the response we have to them. There's a similarity here to existentialism or absurdism: the world itself may be meaningless and indifferent, but we find ourselves forced to make meaning of it. The mirror itself claims objectivity, but it is no more objective than a lake. We think of a lake as part of the natural world, as something that is beautiful; but a lake can be cruel even as it is beautiful, or as it reflects beauty (think of Narcissus, pining away for his beautiful reflection in a lake). We think of a mirror as something manufactured, something relatively objective and passive. But Plath shows that the mirror and the lake are one and the same: parts of a non-human world that is indifferent to human feelings, and thus cruel. Ageing is part of the natural world too, and part of its cruelty. If the poem can be boiled down to a single "meaning" (which it shouldn't be), it is that the world we live in is hostile and cruel even as it claims to be neutral, and that we are all subject to its indifferent, remorseless cruelty.
