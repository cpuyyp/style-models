2 I will admit that the criterion may be different because of the mass difference - the moon will be much more massive relative to the planets than a circumbinary planet would be to a binary star - but I don't think it will make a huge difference. 

Voila! A star is born. Binary systems do exist. The leading theories for how they form is that fragmentation happens during the collapse of the cloud, meaning that it splits in two. Each smaller collapsing cloud then forms a star, creating a binary system. Therefore, you can indeed have your "twin stars". The idea you're talking about resembles the so-called fission hypothesis (see section 2 here), where one protostar, early on, splits in two. There are quite a few problems with the idea, including features of the gas's compressibility. The fragmentation hypothesis is much more commonly accepted. If you're looking for a more detailed overview of the topic, you may find this paper illuminating. 

Getting between buildings The whole no-ground-level restriction is a problem, because the ground is generally the easiest way to get from point A to point B. The aerial element means you will have to make bridges of some sort. I'm not sure rope bridges would be a good idea. Who has that much rope lying around? The alternative material would be telephone wires, but there aren't a lot of above-ground ones in New York City! I would just go with more static bridges - really just glorified planks. If you can nail together a bunch of 2-by-4s and cross Broadway, you're set. But a) Don't fall and b) There isn't a lot of material to make bridges, is there? Sure, you could cannibalize some construction sites, but you're going to run out eventually. You could try to play a giant modified game of Jenga - taking out walls in buildings and, in this case, using them to make bridges - but you'll still run out eventually. Besides, most skyscrapers are made of steel and other metals. You can't break them apart as easily as wooden buildings. But for the sake of this question, let's make some assumptions. Say you can knock down two of the four outer walls of each floor of each building. NYC apparently has 5,937 high-rise buildings, which I'll take to mean buildings ten stories or above. Let's say 75% are in Manhattan. Maybe they have an average of 50 stories apiece, and they are, on average, 50 feet wide and 10 feet per story. So now we have .75 times 5,937 buildings times 50 stories/building times 2 walls/story times 500 square feet/wall = . . . 222637500 square feet of material. Some of it may be glass, but glass is strong enough. For all intents and purposes. Let's make another guess, and say that the average distance between buildings in Manhattan is 50 feet, and each bridge should be about 10 feet wide (Don't trip!). You can therefore have about 445275 bridges in Manhattan. They'll all have to be at about the second or third floor, in order to avoid high-level wind gusts and low-level zombies, so you can forget about great views, but they'll suffice. 

Kleiber's law isn't 100% accepted, I'll admit. The value of the exponent was debated for quite some time, and the relation doesn't hold universally (as noted in the page with the graph, plants don't follow the law). However, it's a pretty good basic estimate of a creature's caloric intake. 

I went about this a bit differently than kingledion, and got a different answer (off by $\sim6$ orders of magnitude!). The difference is that I assumed that there would be accretion no matter what the mass of the black hole is; this is incorrect because accretion would probably be prevented because of pressure by Hawking radiation. I'll keep this answer here for posterity, and also to show that even if you ignore kingledion's key pressure assumption, there's still an even lower limit - and thus his solution still works. A black hole of $\sim10^{16}\text{ kg}$ would certainly be able to heat the gas giant. The power emitted by a black hole from Hawking radiation is $$P=\frac{\hbar c^6}{15360\pi G^2M^2}=-c^2\dot{M}_H$$ where $\dot{M}_H$ is the change in mass of the black hole from Hawking radiation. Let's assume that the black hole also accretes mass; the equation for Bondi accretion should give us a good estimate: $$\dot{M}_B\simeq \frac{\pi\rho G^2M^2}{c_s^3}$$ where $\rho$ is the density and $c_s$ is the speed of sound. The central density of Jupiter is roughly $5\text{ g cm}^{-3}$, or $5000\text{ kg m}^{-3}$. We can find $c_s$ as $$c_s=\sqrt{\frac{K}{\rho}}$$ where $K$ is the bulk modulus - about $125\text{ GPa}$. This gives us $c_s\simeq5000\text{ m/s}$. We then set $$\dot{M}_H+\dot{M}_B=0$$ and solve $$\frac{\hbar c^4}{15360\pi G^2M^2}=\frac{\pi\rho G^2M^2}{c_s^3}\to M=\left[\frac{\hbar c^4c_s^3}{15360\pi^2\rho G^4}\right]^{1/4}$$ Plugging things in, we have $$M=\left[\frac{\hbar c^4(5000\text{ m/s})^3}{15360\pi^2(5000\text{ kg m}^{-3})G^4}\right]^{1/4}=5.158\times10^{10}\text{ kg}$$ This is, as I said, off from kingledion's result by a factor of one million. There are only two things that could really be varied - the bulk modulus and the density. If we move the other factors out, we see that $$M=7.295\times10^8\text{ kg}^{5/4}\text{ s}^{3/4}\text{ m}^{-3/2}\left(\frac{K^{3/2}}{\rho^{5/2}}\right)^{1/4}$$ Even raising $K$ by an order of magnitude and lowering $\rho$ by an order of magnitude only multiplies our result by $10$. This demonstrates the power of radiation pressure! It raises the lower limit by six orders of magnitude, which is pretty incredible. Be careful of what physical assumptions you make.

It shows that homo sapiens never existed during the same period as homo erectus, and was only briefly in the same location as homo neanderthalensis. In fact, the former was active mainly in Asia, while the latter lived in Europe. I think it might be best to leave homo erectus out of it for the time being. We also have to determine just when homo sapiens first developed gills. This is actually very important. If the gills appeared within the last 500,000 or so years, then 

There are some things to consider, though. The atmosphere will likely be water-heavy; you're not guaranteed a nice mixture of nitrogen and carbon dioxide (followed by oxygen, if life arises to produce it - and all you need is a lot of bacteria!). Ammonia might also be present, a relic of the planet's formation farther out form the Sun. None of this precludes aquatic life, of course. There are several excellent candidates for ocean planets: 

I'm glad the bits mentioning specific political parties were edited out, because I was worried that a lot of people would get offended by it (perhaps some were). More importantly, though, it means I don't have to address it in my answer. Well, you still do mention the parties, but there's a way around that. Here's how to become dictator of the United States: 

Is this useful to space exploration? Of course. You've got most of the elements you need. Is it useful to do the kind of space exploration they'll begin with (i.e. orbital exploration and satellite development)? Yes. Will it take away from efforts to go to space? No, because you might have to get to space to get to this mountain. At any rate, they'll follow the progress of early space programs - building high-altitude vehicles - while also making developments on the mountain to help live in space. You might wonder why I'm so optimistic. Well, this target is like going to the Moon. And we did that! But the difference here is that this mountain is more tangible. It's there. You can walk to its base and look up. The Moon's far away, and maybe not something people can relate to as much. But this mountain? That's right here on Earth. And that's quite an encouraging target. People will develop technology to reach it, accelerating technological development in many areas. 

The spectral type of a star tells you, in general, its surface temperature. Unfortunately, there's one main issue here. Each spectral type can give way to a range of luminosities and properties (see any Hertzsprungâ€“Russell diagram). This can be rectified if you just want to create a star as it enters the main sequence, in which case there is a rough one-to-one relationship between temperature and luminosity. The mass of a main sequence star determines the rest of its properties. From it, you can calculate luminosity: $$\frac{L}{L_\odot}\simeq\left(\frac{M}{M_\odot}\right)^{\alpha}\tag{1}$$ where $\alpha$ ranges from $3$ to $4$ - approximations differ. Averaged over the entire range of main sequence masses, this generally works. We can do something similar for the radius of the star: $$\frac{R}{R_\odot}\simeq\left(\frac{M}{M_\odot}\right)^{\beta}\tag{2}$$ where $\beta$ is a little less than $1$ - maybe $0.8\text{-}0.9$. We can then try to approximation the surface temperature using the Stefan Boltzmann law: $$L=4\pi\sigma R^2T^4\tag{3}$$ All we have to do is solve for $T$, but remember. In your case, it seems like we may want to plug $\text{(1)}$ and $\text{(2)}$ into $\text{(3)}$ after converting the radius and luminosity to SI units, giving temperature as a function of mass. Then, you can simply put in a temperature for a given spectral type and estimate the mass, then back-substitute to find the radius and luminosity (and other properties). I'll just add that these are only approximations, although they work pretty well. I'd certainly be comfortable using them. I did go into more detail on the subject in another answer, but honestly, these equations are fine. Additional references: 

This has indeed been investigated. I found a thesis by Daniel Jontof-Hutter (2012) that did a stability analysis of particles in rings orbiting, among other bodies, Saturn. One important quantity he studied was the ratio of electric force to gravity, $L_*$. When $L_*\gg1$, the electric force dominated (the "Lorentz regime"), while when $L_*\ll1$, the gravitational force dominated. He considered the Lorentz force in the case of a rotating magnetic field: $$\vec{F_B}=\frac{q}{c}\left(\vec{v}-\vec{\Omega_p}\times\vec{r}\right)\times\vec{B}$$ where $q$ is the charge of the particle, $c$ is the speed of light, $\vec{r}$ and $\vec{v}$ are the particle's position and velocity, $\vec{\Omega_p}$ is the planet's spin vector and $\vec{B}$ is the magnetic field. The electric component of $\vec{F_B}$ is $q\vec{E}$, where $\vec{E}$ is the electric field: $$\vec{E}=-\frac{1}{c}\left(\vec{\Omega}\times\vec{r}\right)\times\vec{B}$$ $\vec{B}$ is given, for a dipolar magnetic field, as $$\vec{B}=\frac{-g_{10}R_p^3}{r^3}\vec{z}$$ where $R_p$ is the radius of the planet, $r=|\vec{r}|$, and $g_{10}=|\vec{B}(r=R_p)|$. Therefore1, $$L_*=\frac{qg_{10}R_p^3\Omega_p}{GM_pmc}$$ where the planet's mass is $M_p$ and the particle's mass is $m$. Let's go to a picture. 16,000 grains were simulated, at many different values of $\vec{r}$ and $L_*$. Here are the results: 

If a universe is a simulation, then, logically, it must have all the natural laws built into it. Agreed? Now, if it is a deterministic universe - that is a universe where, theoretically, you could predict its entire future if you knew everything about it at a certain point in time - these laws would be all that is needed to run the universe. It's sort of like The Game of Life - you input some data and let the thing go. Now, we live in a universe where quantum mechanics exists, and thus probability exists. This has given a lot of people a lot of headaches, because there are loads of events we can't predict. In other words, you would have a harder time programming in natural laws than you would in a deterministic universe, because you would have to determine some random variables. If a universe is a simulation, then there would have to be an algorithm running in the computer(s) controlling it that determines these random variables - which would not make them random at all. In a deterministic universe, it would be easy to see a glitch. In a certain spot at a certain time, some phenomenon would occur that violates at least one law of science. For example, perhaps a falling ball moves a few nanometers to one side when it shouldn't have. Given the complexity of a large enough simulation, this could happen quite a bit at small scales. Maybe a photon travels in a vacuum at a slightly slower or faster speed than it should have. Perhaps a new particle appears (or disappears) into (or out of) thin air. Any of these things could be a bug, and they would probably happen a lot. But they would be so minor. It would be very rare for large-scale bug (e.g. the Earth suddenly moves 10 million miles in one direction) to happen. But we live in a universe where quantum mechanics rules on some scales, which gives us a very nice little loophole. If there was a bug, it could actually follow the rules of quantum mechanics. How? Well, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle says in part that conservation of energy can be violated on tiny scales for tiny amounts of time. So a particle suddenly appearing and disappearing could actually fit right in. There is a tiny probability in the universe that a lot of odd things could happen - quantum tunneling, for instance - that shouldn't. A bug could masquerade as any of these. So it's fair to say that small bugs could happen that would merely appear to be quantum phenomena. We would write them off as products of uncertainty and chance, and they would go by without anybody thinking that they were bugs. And in a simulation, small bugs would probably be very likely. 

These could all be used against missiles on ballistic trajectories, and I'd bet anything that they could be used against rockets trying to get to orbit (or on suborbital trajectories). 

I've found these by perusing a list of exoplanets in binary systems and doing some cross-checking. The HD 20781/HD 20782 system gives me hope for a habitable setup. The two stars are separated by ~9000 AU, both are G-type stars like the Sun, and stable orbits exist around 1 AU, in the habitable zones of the star. To make a long story short, yes, this will work. 

Work towards the heat death of the universe. Your idea sounds a lot like the heat death of the universe, a hypothetical event where the universe reaches maximum entropy and no more work can be done. This will be the end of the dark era, when just photons, neutrinos, and other small subatomic particles whizzed about. The universe won't reach this state - if it ever does - for over 10100 years. By comparison, the universe is currently about 1.3$\times$1010 years old. So the universe will go on, and on, and on, slowly winding down (for lack of a better analogy). All your organisms have to do is simply go on living. Any work increases the entropy of a closed system, so as long as they live, they are increasing the entropy of the universe and bringing it one step closer to the heat death.
