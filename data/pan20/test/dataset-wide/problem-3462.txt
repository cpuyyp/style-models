You have to differenciate the debt that is already existing from the one that is going to be issued: whenever the US Treasury issue a bond lets say a 10% coupon 10yrs... for a 100USD. It's still going to pay 10USD to the holders during the 10yrs. When you see the yield going up or down it's usually on the secondary market. I say usually because sometimes the government issues bond with a floating rate which can be impacted by a rate increase. As for the new debt that is going to be issued you are right to say that this going to be more costly ! 

Operating expenses: include rent, equipment, inventory costs, marketing, payroll, insurance and funds allocated toward research and development For EBITDA, I guess you can find it on your own ! 

Because let's say that a firm makes even 1$ profit ... Then another firm can come in a sell the product for only 0.99cts profit ! And so one until the equilibrium is the marginal cost of a product ! 

In my lecture slide, it says: "To control complexity cost, shift complexity to later value-added steps ("freeze-point"). The trade off will be: Width of product mix vs. vertical integration. A later freeze-point can give more variants and lower costs." According to my note, it seems that it means the extent of standardization (i.e. until which value creation stage should everything be standardized). Because starting customization at a late stage in e.g. production would result in many components of a product being the same, which can reduce costs. 

For which two pre-condition must exist: the preference must satisfy local non-satiation and all goods' price must be strictly positive. My question is: why must local non-satiation be an essential precondition for these identities? Is that to ensure that the bundle of goods chosen to maximize utility to be indeed optimal? 

In one of my marketing slides it says: The diagnostic potential of micro test market is low because no survey of panel possible; the diagnostic potential of simulated test market is high. I think the diagnostic potential is in regard to product positioning. What does "survey of panel" mean here? 

As you have pointed out: where it comes from is very important. As to the Japanese situation it is quiet different from the US position from example. In fact most of the Japanese debt is owned by Japanese people (90% of the current debt). More specifically the BoJ plays a big role as a buyer, and puts pressure on Japanese yield, which makes it cheaper for the government to issue bonds ! Another interesting point that is usually left by anlysts: Japan is the biggest creditor in the world. The country holds a net amount of about 3 trillion USD (367 trillion yen) of financial assets through the world, which makes Japan the first creditor worldwide (before China !). An interesting further reading which gives other information on the Japanese debt under stress tests of the IMF (P.40): $URL$ You also might want to read this paper of Rogoff and Reinhart called "Growth in a time of debt": $URL$ . It was really criticized but is a good first glimpse... Afterwards you might want to go a little bit deeper into the debt sustainability analysis of the IMF... Edit 

I tried to look for this term on the Internet, to no avail, as what I found does not fit into the context I found this word in. My context is: The incentive-compatible instrument of Vickrey Auction is that there is no incentive for bidders to submit speculative bids. What does "speculative bid" mean here? Thanks in advance. 

In my lecture slide, it is said to be one of the competition-based price determination. When I searched online, I was unable to find anything relevant. 

According to $URL$ the maximum of the firm's profit at some output is given by the minimum of the difference between the profit and the revenue. However, it does not sound right, as the difference of difference of the profit and the revenue is the negative of the cost of the input. The minimum would correspond to the maximum cost for input incurred. How would the maximum of the fir's profit at this point? Also what does it mean by "at some output y*(p)"? Is y*(p) fixed here? 

I am looking at the balance sheet of Coca-Cola ($URL$ but I cannot guess where loans with banks are. These liabilities accounts are: 

Page 75 of document: $URL$ I see, as Alecos suggested, that debt includes both loans and bonds. Itwas my mistake to assume debt is only bonds. 

Your idea was proposed more than 100 years ago by Silvio Gesell ($URL$ He wanted to create a National Currency Office, in charge of money. No private banks. Money would be created in accordance with amount of wealth available. It would also depreciate, to make people spend it. Read his book "Natural Economic Order". It is online. You might be interested also in Social Credit ($URL$ I am reading about this at the moment. Very interesting. 

The "common man" conception of money is not helpful to think about these issues. Money is not ONLY currency and notes anymore. These are just a TOKEN used to distribute goods and provide exchanges. They are not the real stuff. For example, when you make a bank account transfer, you are not moving TOKENS. Why would you? Banks are given these tokens by the central bank in order to keep a smooth movement of payments. So Apple does not have 80% of all tokens of the US economy in a vault somewhere. Why would they? It's dangerous! They have such ownership of wealth, but in the form of a current account and other assets. So you need to think differently between a claim on wealth, WHICH CAN BE TURNED INTO TOKENS, and the TOKENS THEMSELVES.
