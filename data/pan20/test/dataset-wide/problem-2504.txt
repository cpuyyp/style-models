Here is a quote from the Anguttara Nikaya where the Buddha explains how to live together in a marriage. 

"Not-self" (Anatta), is together with Anicca and Dukkha, known as the Three Characteristics of Existence (of Conditioned Phenomena). The Five Aggregates, wherein Rupa (material form, physical phenomena) is listed, are subject to the Three Characteristics of Existence. The uncontrollability of the Aggregates is experientially visible through direct seeing, ie. the practice of Vipassana Meditation. Here it can be seen with ones own eyes, how the Form-aggregate arises and ceases incessantly, based on impersonal causes and conditions. In the Anattalakkhana Sutta, the Buddha explains how form can be regarded as not-self: 

In the Majjhima Nikaya, the Buddha gives his monks a discourse on the "The Exposition of Non-Conflict". In here he mentions the Middle Way: 

So the fastest way in any form of Samatha meditation is to ensure that the hindrances are kept in check. This can be done in a number of ways; most importantly is to guard/restrain the sense-doors. That can be done either by practicing 

Yes he did. When practicing insight meditation it becomes very clear that the Dhamma can only come from a fully enlightened Buddha. 

The untrained mind, i.e. a mind that has not been subjected to systematic, continual practice, development and purification, can be classified as an "amateur" mind. It does not know how to deal with physical or mental objects such as pain, ill-will, greed etc. It is therefore more likely to cling in the event of death, thereby leading to rebirth. A trained mind that sees clearly with no obstructions, has insights into the true nature of reality, knows how to deal with conditioned phenomena and has consistently been trained in meditation, is a mind that is more likely not to cling in the event of death. The trained mind will be able to merely observe what happens in the death process, thereby liberating itself from Samsara. That mind can be classified as a "professional" mind. 

When I read your question I actually think you gave a perfect answer, i.e. "...the continuous flow of arising and passing away of all conditioned things...". I'm not too familiar with Stephen Levine or his book but it sounds like he is teaching about exactly this quality of conditioned phenomena. What is this quality? Conditioned phenomena is also called compounded phenomena, meaning that they consists of other phenomena that again consists of other phenomena. In other words, we are here dealing with phenomena based on causality. In Buddhism we have a Dhamma called the Three Characteristics of Existence, which are impermanence, unsatisfactoriness and uncontrollability. These characterize conditioned phenomena. In regard to the question, especially impermanence and uncontrollability is important here. Impermanence shows that phenomena arise and cease. They come and go according to their respective causes and conditions. Uncontrollability shows that there is no stability or control to be found anywhere. One cannot exercise control over this flow. Mahasi Sayadaw calls it therefore oppressive and terrible. Oppressive is the incessant arising and ceasing of conditioned phenomena. It sounds very much as what Stephen Levine is teaching about and what you yourself are describing. Now, the Buddha once said that its okay to use conventional language but that one should not be fooled thereby. In this regard, it means that all these different words (concepts) really just mean the same thing. Its just different ways of teaching it. If we really want to understand what flow is then the practice of insight meditation should be undertaken. Intellectual knowledge only goes so far. With wisdom gained from insight meditation one will be able to see conditioned reality with ones own eyes. In the Sabbasava Sutta (MN 2) the Buddha taught about 7 taints that should be overcome and with what method they should be overcome. The first taint should be overcome by seeing, i.e. The Four Noble Truths should be seen with ones own eyes. The truth about Samsara should be seen with ones own eyes, in here lies the incessant arising and ceasing of phenomena. 

In a meditative context "anger" is one of The Five Hindrances which are obstacles to meditative progress. Anger belongs to the 2nd hindrance, i.e. Ill-will (hatred, anger, dislike, hostility, resentment etc.). There are antidotes for these hindrances, i.e. ways to deal with them so that one can dispel of them and continue on with the practice. In the "Majjhima Nikaya Verse 20: Vitakkasanthana Sutta: The Removal of Distracting Thoughts" the Buddha gave 5 methods for dealing with the hindrances. I will mention the 5 methods first and then there is a quote from the Majjhima Nikaya where you can read them more in-depth. To make this easier to understand I want to give an idea of where in the Dhamma we are located right now. Take a look at the illustration. You might have to zoom in to see it. 

If you want to become an even more confused Buddhist, then keep pondering this :) If not, then stop pondering this and go practice. You might also want to take a look at the Four Imponderables: 

In the Theravada tradition a novice recieves a new name in Pali when a senior monk accepts his/her request to become Preceptor. For more information see "Ordination Procedure in the Theravada Tradition". 

You have to look at which reality you are dealing with. If you are dealing with sammuti-sacca which is the conventional reality then one can say that a soul, self, spirit, being etc. exists. Why? Because conventional reality is dealing with concepts. A soul is a concept. A self is a concept. If you try to search for them through the method of insight meditation you will not find a lasting, permanent, indestructible entity anywhere. Instead you will come to see that the false idea of a self is merely a mental formation belonging to the 4th aggregate. If you deal with paramattha-sacca which is ultimate reality then concepts do not exist and there is no problem with a soul/self to begin with. The thing is that things work fine without the need for a self. By adding a self to the equation one is enforcing and strengthening the suffering by identifying and taking ownership of it. There is a profound difference in saying "i am angry" and "anger has arisen in the mind". There is also a build-in problem in the way language is used. We are forced to speak about e.g. consciousness by using nouns which can imply that there is something there. But there is not. Consciousness is not a thing. Its a knowing. What we normally think is consciousness is really a series of cittas (momentary acts of consciousness) that are happening in rapid succession. The Buddha once said that its okay to use conventional language but do not be fooled thereby. 

As the effects of kamma is impermanent the dog would sooner or later be reborn in either lower, same or higher realms. Here the different types of kamma can come to fruition if the right conditions for them to ripen is met. 

Most of the books are already mentioned and many of them are really good introductory books. I have one more to add. Its called "What Buddhists Believe" by. Ven. K. Sri Dhammananda. In here he discusses e.g. "The Life and Nature of the Buddha, His Message, Basic Doctrines, The Tipitaka, Kamma, Morality, Rebirth, Nibbana, How to lead a buddhist life and much more". The book is highly recommended. Also here is a Buddhist Dictionary - Manual of Buddhist Terms and Doctrines by Ven. Nyanatiloka. Lanka 

I was reading a chapter called "The Buddhist Stand on the Death Sentence" on p. 390-393 in the book "What Buddhists Believe" by Ven. K. Sri Dhammananda. In here it is written that the law is supreme and that buddhists must always respect and obey the laws of the country they live in and that if they break the law they must also accept the punishment. Then in the end of the chapter he talks about the situation where war breaks out and all able-bodied men are to be conscripted as soldiers by law of that nation. Being a soldier requires one to maybe engage in killing of other beings or maybe become forced to commit unwholesome actions that one does not want to do since it will break the buddhist ethical code and precepts. But if they choose not to do it they will be breaking the law of that nation. What do buddhists do in that situation? Thank you for your time. Lanka 

Meditation in groups can be both beneficial and tiresome as this might be an example of. When practicing vipassana meditation one is working with one's defilements. That means that the "filter or suppression" is absent. Everything comes up in the meditation so that one can observe it and learn from it. That goes for all of the group members if they are practicing insight meditation. When a lot of defilements are being stirred up and dealt with it can also affect the behavior of the individuals in the group if they do not know how to handle it. It's easy to fall into the "me too" category and then begin to create small groups within the group creating separation and sabotage. It could be that the path factor of Sila is being neclected here. When one is practicing the factors of conduct that also means to stay centered in the present - to keep the mind in the present and thereby not following after objects. It seems that some of the meditators from this group is not centered, thereby attaching and clinging to objects, i.e. the pleasant feelings of the company of the other meditators creating the separation group. The power struggles also indicate that some of the meditators are identifying and taking ownership of objects thereby creating a Self. It could also be that they are practicing samatha meditation and thereby not working with the defilements but instead keeping them suspended and dormant. The latent defilements can then spring up at any time when they are triggered, e.g. by some of the group members being together in the same room. As meditators they should work to overcome these behaviors since they are obviously hindrances to progress both for themselves and the other meditators in the group.
