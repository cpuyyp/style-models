As a layman, I can tell you that there are some issues with your proposal. The biggest one is that White holes probably don't exist. They're purely theoretical and, even worse than that, they're mostly not even well defined theoretical objects. For a physical hypothesis to work, every element of the theory needs to be precisely defined. White holes aren't well defined. (now, let me add that, perhaps White holes are well defined by Einstein's field equations, I'm not sure, but the specifics go above my paygrade). And running time in reverse, a black hole really doesn't look anything like a big bang, and, granted, we don't know what the/a big bang looked like, but we know what a black hole swallowing matter looks like. It absorbs matter by accretion disk and it shoots out jets along the accretion disks axis. Running time backwards you can see streams of matter and the accretion disk reforming into stars and dust that flies away from the black hole but that gravitational consumption in reverse That looks NOTHING like the big bang is thought to have looked. The moments after the big bang are believed to have been a very hot, dense and rapidly expanding quark/photon/fundamental particle soup kind of thing. Nothing in today's universe, backwards or forwards in time, looks anything close to that, so running time backwards doesn't really help. The very early universe and the ratio of hydrogen to helium and the presence and near perfect uniformity of the background radiation all imply a mostly uniform, very hot, very dense, and only the slightest bit lumpy rapidly expanding origin, that only works under modern physical laws if space expands faster than the speed of light. We can re-create those conditions, but only for the tinyest fractions of a second, and with only a handful of particles, in particle accelerators. You might think that inside a black hole, similar conditions exist, but that's not entirely true. Inside a black hole, gravity is dominant. Due to faster than light expansion and uniformity, it's not believed that gravity was a dominant force in the moments after the big bang. It was a force, but not a dominant force. The space of space-time, for example, is very different inside a black hole than in the moments after the big bang. A final issue with your question is whether the big bang was an explosion, or, more specifically that it originated from a source-point-origin at all, (as it's often presented), or whether it was an expansion that took place everywhere (everywhere stretch, so to speak). A theoretical white hole ejecting matter would be a source point and a source point is subject to the inverse square rule and we'd expect to see a variation in density and evidence of a direction towards the origin. We don't see that. The observable universe appears remarkably homogeneous, which is only possible, from a source-point, if the size is enormously large. The rate that distant galaxies move away from us is also very difficult to explain without some kind of dark energy expansion. The variations in the image are exaggerated. The cosmic background radiation is very homogeneous, implying we were inside the expansion, not part of some material that was ejected. 

It's not the size of the Moons so much as the proximity to the sun that makes a 2 moon system (and especially a 2 moon horse-shoe orbit) unstable. Size matters too, but the proximity to the sun matters more. The sun's tidal force perturbs the Moon's orbit around the earth quite a bit. If Earth was much further from the sun, it could have several moons, not just one and some a fair bit more distant and the big moon's orbit would be nearly circular due the inverse tidal forces, which tend to circularize an orbit. Making the moon's smaller helps some, but what you really need, if you want that orbit to be relatively long-lasting, is to push the Earth away from the sun at least a few more astronomical units. If we ignore the solar-tidal effects, then Earth could have 2 moons in a horse-shoe orbit to each other. As to what it would look like, the first thing to consider is that everything in the sky rises in the east and sets in the west and that's because the Earth rotates. If you watch each of the two horseshoe moons individually, they would move much like our moon, rising in the east, moving slowly against the fixed stars, and setting in the west. The second thing to consider is that the Moons, the planets and the sun move against the fixed background stars, but this movement is slow unless the Moon is very close to Earth. Our Moon, moves a full 360 degrees across the fixed stars once every 27 days (sidereal orbit). The motion of the two moons individually would be very similar to our moon now in terms of new, waxing, full, waning, and repeat. What the horseshoe orbit would do is you'd see one moon slowly catching up to the other, perhaps touching it from the point of view of earth, but never passing it. it would get close, then it would reverse direction relative to the other moon and in a couple/few weeks, it would approach from the other direction, slow down and reverse. Each moon individual would behave much like our moon but relative to each other there would be this weird game of attraction-repulsion between them. I believe (but don't quote me on this), from Earth you'd never see the Moons' cross, but you'd perhaps see them touch. The nature of the horeshoe orbit prevents crossing and passing, you'd just see them move closer, then move further away from each other. If you had a really good eye, you might be able to notice the smaller moon change size as it moves closer and further from the Earth as the moon's get close, but that difference would be subtle. This is the best diagram I've seen for what happens as the moons get close. Unfortunately it's not in English, but it's not hard to follow: $URL$ The horseshoe back and forth, assuming some degree of stability, it should have a regular period, just as the full-moons would have a period. The optimal time for moon watching would be when those 2 periods coincide and you have a double full moon. The horseshoe period and the full moon period (currently 29 days - sidereal orbit) should have nothing to do with each other but they could in theory be coincidentally in some kind of resonance. As pointed out in the other thread, even if the Earth was far enough away from the sun to have two moons in this pattern, it's probably not truly long-term stable. It might last for a few hundred orbits, or a few thousand. It's not what is generally considered a stable orbit. 

Yes it's theoretical, but on some levels, estimates can be calculated. (probably better for space-ex than here), but it's a fun design to think about. The basic design, the ship generates a magnetic field and catches atoms in space as it moves. I've read that the "catch" might be about a square mile in area, so you can calculate how much hydrogen and alpha particles and other particles (far less) and electrons (some). As the ship picks up speed it's catch rate would increase. There's two primary problems. The materials that it would catch in space, mostly charged particles. Protons and Alpha Particles, they are not easy to fuse. There are much better fusion materials available if you make your own deuterium for example, or lithium deuteride for easier storage, or 3He. Fusing mostly protons and alpha particles is very hard and might never be practical. You could in theory calculate the energy output - 4 protons into 1 helium yeilds 0.7% mass to energy ratio, which isn't bad, but won't get you close to the speed of light. The other problem is that the magnetic catch that the ship generates, you have to take into account every particle it encounters and factor in the drag. If each proton can deliver 0.7% of it's mass into energy, there becomes a velocity where that proton hits the ship where you lose about that much upon impact. A 3rd impracticality is that space is very empty and hydrogen is very light and quite abundant. It doesn't make much sense to collect it in empty space when you can simply carry your own. Bottom line is that it's probably not a useful design. Could it work? Sure. It would work best riding a stream of particles behind you, like riding a jet from a distant solar flare or supernova. You'd still need to solve the the hydrogen fusion problem and if you solve that, you could probably design better ways to fly than a ramjet. So, yes, it could work. Solar panels can drive a car and sails can move a battleship, but neither is particularly fast. 

In the case of Alpha Centauri A&B and Proxima Centauri, A&B orbit each other at elliptical orbits, getting almost as close as the Sun is to Saturn and about as far as the Sun is to Neptune. Proxima Centauri is about 1,000 times further out and it's a tiny compared to the inner 2, so for simulation purposes, it's essentially a 2 star system with a far distant 3rd orbiting the inner 2. The 3rd star is so far and comparatively small that it has essentially zero effect on the simulation.
