I believe there is nothing wrong in asking "what do you mean by..." if the topic is really unclear. Also concluding their ideas by "if I understood you correctly, you mean..." or "just for my understanding, ...". To avoid fuss refrain from making statements like "I don't understand what you mean", rather ask open questions instead giving the other party the possibility to share their thoughts. In the beginning it may seem as it is you, who has problems with understanding your colleague, but as the times go, they will develop the ways of communication leading to the situation that you don't need to ask additional questions. Anyway, it is not something that will happen immediately, it will be a process. Have patience, act proactively. Good luck! 

This way you won't mix irrelevant activities into your professional resume while keeping company A on your resume. 

It is your first job in the industry, but you're already aware that you don't want to be pushy - that's positive. Communication is the key - a reasonable employer will work this situation out. Good luck! 

Why don't you have some sections on your resume, like "occupational experience" where you state company B, and later on something like "other activities / voluntary work" where you state company A, giving the time frames of the activities you performed. For someone doing an extensive background check this would seem as: 

Schedule a weekly one-on-one with your manager. Each week, show him what you've done, what you've learned. Ask for feedback. Then, show what you plan to do next week. That way he gets a chance to change the course, should he feel the need to. If you can, come up with a "roadmap" of what big areas you'll be learning when. The shorter by, the more detail: stuff that you plan to do next month can be one line ("databases"), stuff you'll do next week needs to be more detailed. Update the roadmap each week. Send it to your manager the day before your one-on-one, and maybe the day after if he proposed changes. Ask your manager how you can check if you're doing OK: should you start making small changes, helping your coworker, picking up minor bugs and fix them? Or do they only want you to learn the theory without checking if you're actually getting it right? 

Then it's probably a good idea to assume this is part of his job description. Showing a willingness to help him from your side is not a bad thing. Use the first one on one to get acquainted, explain your role in the team/company and mention you've contacted management before about problems you identified, and that you'd be more than willing to discuss these with him should he wish so. You will come off as cooperative, problem-solving person. 

I clearly understand your problem. You can start with kindly but firmly reminding your boss that officially you are not allowed to use the product any longer and surely you won't be legally allowed to release your product without obtaining the licence from ABC. Happy flow is that your boss buys the licence or appoints you to purchase one. Sad flow - your boss will say "dobra, dobra" [all right, all right] meaning that you should carry on without a licence. It would be, (as far as I know the software agreements), breach of trial agreement. Whether you might have problems depends on your employment form (employee or contractor). To be 100% sure you should ask a lawyer. And yes, you should remind your boss to purchase the licence. 

As I have been in similar situation, I can tell you what I've done then. If the offer seemed reasonable (work environment, industry branch, commute time) I had attended the interview, provided that it hadn't collided with my then current work and other tasks. I gained quite some interview experience, I also got an idea on what the employers (in most cases they were intermediaries) expect from software developers. After some time I knew that my situation was not that bad as I thought and possible gains of switching to the new employer would not pay off the effort of leaving the current (suddenly leaving the on-going projects, changing the retirement plan and insurances, etc. and starting off at the new project). Still, I managed to slightly grow my network, which paid off later. There is a saying in the country where I live - the neighbour's lawn is always greener. The offers you receive now may seem great on paper, but once you go through an interview, you get completely different point of view. But if you don't, you keep on living with the idea of much better position (though unverified) elsewhere. TL;DR; If you have time and feel like, attend the interviews (provided you don't sacrifice your current responsibilities). If you are happy with what you have now and you're not looking for a change, respond with "Thank you for your offer. I'm not interested in new challenges at the moment. Should my situation change, I'd gladly reach out to you." 

This way you overstep you boundaries less, by asking casually and at a better time. You come over more professionally and less "out of the blue" than with a random email. I would advise against mentioning magical fairies. 

It's risky. If you really want to do something, consider talking to his boss. Part of the team managers job is to manage - it looks like he's not doing a good job here, making decisions that are not optimal for the company. Since you're not in a position to evaluate, hand over the info to someone who does. It is their job to decide whether to act or not. 

Wait (or create) a better moment to ask their manager. Maybe after a succesful meeting or project delivery, where you're debriefing and celebrating. Ask him casually (not by email, not in writing) what would benefit his company most, what's keeping him from doing just that, what role you or your company could take on here. 

The actual timespans greatly differ. A blue collar worker at a manufactoring line might be 60% productive at 60% of his job real fast, since the scope of the job might be smaller – there is less to learn, and it’s more monotone. They get into a routine fast. Don't be afraid to ask your manager this! They will have an idea in mind of what to expect from you. "At which point in time do you think I will be fully trained, be able to work independantly and start adding value to the company?" You leaving the company will always "hurt". They invested in you and (as with any investment) are hoping for good returns on that investment. If you want to minimise that, there are other things you can do when you leave: document your job well, give a long notice period, train your remplacement. 

Please, don't take it personally, but it seems like you have some sort of disability (you took the trouble of finding a medical explanation for your condition). If you were missing a limb, you'd be provided with some assistive tools, if you were having chronic back problems you'd receive more ergonomic workplace, wouldn't you? I see the following choices: 

Perhaps this is the reason for the meeting - to see whether this consultant is suitable for your problem? Do you have the name of this person? Can you Google/LinkedIn them? 

Long story short - company A is not flawless here - they shed a considerable amount of uncertainty. Use this as the reason for walk-away message if you chose for option 1 or 2. But if you hear "then go", do your best and not look at company B as a punishment. I with you to make a satisfactory choice. 

you want to work for company A (starting date unknown, salary acceptable, location excellent) but use contract from company B to improve the salary you want to start working ASAP and company B comes in handy (known starting date, excellent salary, acceptable location) you want to work for company A at all costs (you don't mind waiting, you accept the salary) 

Ask your boss if there is/will be an NDA signed before the meeting. If so, you can share sensitive information.
