The additional recommendation I would make would be that you list and weigh all your gear, then after each trip note whether you needed each item or not (and whether there was anything you wanted but didn't have). Obviously there will be some things (whistle, med kit) that you hope you will never use, but need them anyway, but this gives you a good idea of what you can drop. My pack weight has come down a lot with experience. 

Your pack is substantially heavier than I would be happy with for 2-3 days. For two days I take 7kg including food and water filter. Many of the other answers have good suggestions; I think there are two general themes: 

It's always okay to take away trash! I'm not just being tongue in cheek here. Many US National Parks (and other protected areas) have more latitude for beach-combing; manmade items like sea-glass may be considered trash / non-natural additions and be fair game to remove. Again, you'll want to note the specific regulations for the Park you're in; and of course be attentive to man-made items that could be artifacts and to items that might have living creatures attached to them. 

My tent (REI Quarterdome) has mesh pockets on the ceiling – I find stuffing a headlamp up there is a reasonable space lighting solution. 

The European Death Knot is commonly used for joining two ropes for an abseil. I would not say it is "not considered safe" - e.g. the British Mountaineering Council's website lists it as a possible abseil knot. Although not the most secure knot it has the advantage that it is small and less likely to snag on edges than larger knots or stronger symmetrical knots such as the double fisherman's knot. If poorly tied, and/or tied with short "tails" (free ends) then it can invert and come undone under load, which has caused accidents some examples on here. This may be the reason for the name, or it may be due to confusion between this and the similar one-sided figure of eight bend, which is dangerous and can easily invert under body weight. Some test results for various one-sided knots are here. Some information about the EDK and a potentially safer alternative is here. 

As a general rule I don't think you should fire .50 cal rifle rounds at any object you'd like to keep intact. They tend to be rather destructive. As for exactly how bad it was, try inspecting the tree. Did the shots go through a solid target first, or was this a paper target/did they miss the target? What can you see when shining a flaslight into the entry point? Do you see any exit points? Are they small and bullet shaped in a straight line from the entry point, or are there chunks of tree missing? It's a big tree though, it can soak some damage. I first read that as a 2 inch tree, I was kind of surprised it still looked like it would survive. If you want us to be able to analyse better, send pictures of the situation please. 

I've used OS 1:25k and 1:50k extensively in the UK. I also have a little experience of using 1:40k Harveys maps (Lake district, for mountain marathons). I have been impressed with the Harveys: in detail as well as scale they sit nicely in between the two OS scales. So you get very detailed contours (nearly as much as the OS 1:25k), but less of the clutter on the 1:25k OS maps - they don't attempt to map every fence post and small rock. I personally find that a lot of the fine detail in the 1:25k is not very helpful for navigation, but I do like to have more detailed contours than the 1:50k offers. Another (small) advantage with the Harveys is that they seem to have more sensible coverage. For example, in the Lake District I recently had to take four OS maps where one of the Harveys maps would have covered it. But that just depends on where you want to walk. 

Long tangent on Rhododendron Toxicity While this doesn't directly address the question of burning Rhododendron wood, the whole idea that Rhododendron smoke might be poisonous springs from the idea that it is a very poisonous plant to ingest. And, while I'm not encouraging anyone to eat large quantities of Rhododendron, I suspect that the often-repeated stories about its toxicity are overblown: Tales of poisonous Rhododendron honey go back literally thousands of years (and were even repeated in the 2009 Sherlock Holmes movie!), but don't apply to all species / methods: Rhododendron honey is common in the Himalayas, and made in Europe as well (it's tasty!). It's used in Asia and Europe as a medicine. Most of the modern cases are of people becoming sick from using medicinal-grade Rhododendron honey. There's also evidence for species differences and processing effects (drying reduces grayanotoxin) on the toxicity of other parts of rhododendron, both from chemical studies, and again from my experience in the Himalaya, where flowers of some Rhododendron species are eaten and others considered poisonous, and leaves of some species used as animal forage and others for animal medicine. American Rhododendron vegetation is more famous for poisoning livestock, but this also varies between goats and sheep who show more ill effects, and deer with fewer. The toxicity seems to be even less in humans, and the cases of poisoning are in fact very rare. 

I have a new water filter, which removes bacteria and protozoa. It's tempting to imagine that I can now go around drinking from whatever revolting-looking puddles I come across, but I'm mindful that the filter will not remove viruses and nor will it remove harmful dissolved chemicals. Are either of these two forms of contamination likely in upland UK areas? Are there any ways to tell that a body of water may not be fit to drink even after filtering? One example might be visible algal blooms (which can produce harmful toxins which won't be filtered out, though the algae themselves will). Of course this will also (partly) apply to boiling - though boiling will inactivate most (all?) viruses it will not deal with all forms of chemical contamination. 

Fleece dries fast, and fleece is relatively warm while wet. It's probably the best you're going to get in normal clothing materials. But it's not an alternative to a wetsuit or drysuit, more of a "I'm going hiking with a light jacket in autumn" option, or an addition for below a wetsuit. If that's what you're looking for in terms of how wet you'll get, how long you'll stay wet and how cold the weather will be, it's a good option. Add a dry top/anorak to keep the wind out, and you've got a decent flatwater kayak/canoe combination. Thermal shirts (thanks for the correction Martin) sometimes called thermal underwear, often made from some combination of polyester and viscose or such, are a good option as well. They're a lot thinner than a good fleece sweater, but are form fitting and surprisingly warm for their thickness. A thermoshirt and an anorak works maybe just a bit worse than fleece and anorak, a thermoshirt alone can be nice of a warmer day if the water's not too cold. They can also be layered. When doing even light whitewater, sea paddling or longer trips think about it a bit, try to build up some experience so you'll know your limits and those of your gear. Better safe than hypothermic.
