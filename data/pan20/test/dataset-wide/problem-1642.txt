Commentary notes that this gives a similar rate for blacks and whites when compared with their relative crime rates. Of course, not all decedents in police killings are involved in violent crimes. The real use of that number is as a proxy for police contacts by race, which is not generally tracked. An alternate source of data where analysis showed similar conclusions. That only studied urban areas where more people are black. And it only looked at homicides. Black neighborhoods are poorer, may spend less money on police training and salaries, and may use police in roles where wealthier neighborhoods would call in specialists. ProPublica has data on the race of the police officers. 78% of those killed by black officers are black. Contrast that with 46% of those killed by white officers. Summary More whites than blacks are killed by police, but there are more whites than blacks overall. Taken by population, blacks are more likely to be killed by police than whites, but blacks are more likely to be involved in crimes. Normalizing by ratio of police killings to ratio of violent crimes by race, blacks and whites are about equally likely to be the decedent in a police killing. 

Source The statement then is normally attributed to Martin Luther (the German professor of theology, 1483-1546), but there is no documentation in his writings. Apparently it was attributed to him as early as 1944. Greg Hewlett said: 

While this is accurate, it doesn't really explain why the Jones Act is problematic. The issue isn't necessarily carrying goods between United States (US) ports. It's that the Jones Act prevents a ship traveling to a mainland US port from offloading cargo at Puerto Rico as it passes. A ship with cargo intended for Puerto Rico and with cargo intended for Miami goes past Puerto Rico without stopping and offloads all of its cargo in Miami. Then a US ship transports the cargo from Miami to Puerto Rico. Meanwhile, if the ship carries cargo for Jamaica, it can offload that and pick up Jamaica to Miami cargo to replace it. 

Anyway, no documentation it was originated by either. May or may not have been used by Martin Luther King, Jr. 

I agree with the assertion that we currently have insufficient evidence. There has been one fatality associated with a self-driving car. Tesla said: 

The Cook Political Report creates a statistic it calls the Partisan Voting Index. The Cook PVI measures the presidential returns in the last two elections for each congressional district and turns them into a simple measure of partisanship. The 2018 list is PDF archive. For simplicity, I get this from Wikipedia, which is not paywalled or archived. The point is that according to the Cook PVI, the twenty-one most partisan districts are not Republican but Democrat. And the majority of these happen not in states where Republicans controlled the redistricting process, like Ohio and North Carolina, but in states where the Democrats did. 

TL;DR: No, not guns per capita, but the reverse, percentage of households with guns is decreasing. This may have simply been clumsy speaking. Guns per capita is increasing while the percentage of households with guns is decreasing. CNN: 

According to Wikipedia, Puerto Rico imports $44 billion a year. Half that would be $22 billion, not $2.8 billion or $9.8 billion. This suggests but does not establish that McCain might have been referring to the cost of transportation (importing), not the cost of imports. 

They don't claim that he wasn't truthfully describing the constitutionality of stop-and-frisk. They claim that there is an alternative interpretation of his statement (that he may not have intended) that is false: 

Misspellings and lack of capitalization from the original transcript, which I copied and pasted. Not exactly the clearest of passages. Here is an example of a historian's analysis of Jefferson's writing: 

Note that this statistic is different. It's not just "polluted" water but also lack of basic sanitation and hygiene. This would also include things like not washing one's hands after going to the bathroom. Many of us in the developed world may find the claim here confusing. From the image: 

I don't know that that is accurate. It's intended as a slur certainly, but it's not derogatory in the same way as many other words. It's a play on the relationship between MSNBC and NBC. MSNBC is the openly liberal cable channel owned by NBC Universal. It's intended as the liberal counterweight to Fox News. Note that Fox News brands itself as the conservative counterweight to CNN. Conservatives might regard MSESPN as a derogatory term, because conservatives don't think much of MSNBC (72% of consistent conservatives distrust MSNBC). Liberals don't have the same reaction (52% of consistent liberals trust MSNBC). The trust/distrust numbers add to less than 100%, because a significant portion neither trust nor distrust. What this really seems to be saying is that ESPN is showing itself to be politically biased in the same way that MSNBC is. I don't know that that can be evaluated objectively. But that's what that term is trying to claim (true or not). 

TL;DR: not exactly. Black Lives Matter As others have said, this image misrepresents what the Black Lives Matter movement protests. As a general rule, police shootings don't appear in crime statistics as most are considered justifiable. That's the basic Black Lives Matters complaint. That police shootings of black decedents are overwhelmingly marked as justified. Note that according to the Washington Post, 258 black decedents were shot by police officers in the year they studied. I'll leave it up to you if you want to do the math to compare to the other numbers from the image. That said, there seems to be a separate claim in this question, unrelated to the point that the image was trying to make: That whites are as likely to be killed by blacks as other whites. This is a false claim based on a misinterpretation of what the image shows. Raw data The image is showing Expanded Homicide Data Table 6 as the source of the data. So let's look at that data directly.
