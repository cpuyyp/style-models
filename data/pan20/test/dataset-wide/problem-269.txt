Humans doing lab work with high powered lasers generally do so from bunkers/control rooms with no optical paths to the experiment. 

Strange matter would be natural in the sense that it exists somewhere in the Universe without human intervention but it is not native to the Earth (that we know of) and we wouldn't normally think of it as an element. If the Strange Matter Hypothesis is true, than a tiny bit (one to a few particles) of it would slowly convert all normal matter it comes in contact with, into strange matter. This will destroy the Earth. You would make strange matter in a particle accelerator. I do not know the size required to make it (e.g. CERN might not be powerful enough). Two mechanisms would work in concert to destroy the Earth. 4a. First, the conversion from normal matter to strange matter would liberate vast quantities of energy. Early in the process, these effects wouldn't be noticed but towards the end, the Earth would begin to glow like a star. 4b. Second, the conversion would vastly increase the density of the matter. It would turn the Earth into a stable substellar neutron object. 

My mental image of a technologically advance civilization is one of a pyramid. Each layer of technology relies on underlying layers of technology and labor. You might know loads about rocket science but know nothing about the production of the fuel that the rocket needs. Your sole survivor also needs to feed, cloth, recreate, shelter, etc. himself while building that ship and he has to provide all the labor for that too (for most people living in primitive conditions, that's a full-time job). I think if the OP changed the first sentence to 

So the momentum transfer from each encounter will be about the same and it equals: $$ m_{Jupiter} \cdot \Delta V_{Jupiter} = m_{Earth} \cdot \Delta V_{Earth} = m_{Vesta} \cdot \Delta V_{Vesta} $$ So each interaction will give the following $\Delta V$: 

Power & Thermal Control If at or nearer the Earth's orbit, then PV (photovoltaic) power generation is viable. Outside of Earth's orbit, it rapidly becomes impractical. Otherwise, you'll need to use nuclear. Since we haven't mastered fusion power yet, the reactors will need fissionable reactor fuel. Until the colony establishes its own Uranium ore mining & refining infrastructure, the fuel will have to come from the Earth. Power generation requires the ability to dump waste heat. If established on Mars, then the Martian atmosphere could aid in dumping waste heat. However, the Martian atmosphere is so thin that it should not be used as the primary means of dumping heat. I personally think that something similar to the closed-loop geothermal heating system would work quite well (run water through pipes buried in the Martian / Lunar / Hermian crust). Dumping the waste heat is a requirement for either power generation system. Communications Either high gain & high frequency radio or use optical lasers to transmit data. Since the colony and the Earth will both be in predictable locations, aiming should not pose a problem. Living Space If we are able to use the concept proposed in the The Millennial Project: Colonizing the Galaxy in Eight Easy Steps of putting your colony in and around a "right sized" crater, then you can use the domed crater as your green space (recreation and plant growing). Regardless of where you establish your colony (Mercury's pole, Moon's pole, or Mars), the plants will require supplemental lighting. This can either be done with mirrors or by dedicated lighting fixtures. If there isn't enough space under the dome, then living and working space can be made into tunnels around the domed crater. Socio-economically speaking Harvesting raw materials from space for shipping back to Earth is a losing proposition. The margins on raw materials are so low that extravagant costs incurred to harvest them will always (foreseeable future anyway) make them too expensive to use on Earth. You will lose your shirt and everything else if you're planning to mine asteroids for precious metals. In fact the "shipping costs" associated with space travel make it very difficult for space created items to compete with terrestrial manufactured goods ... on Earth. The most realistic place to use goods made in space, would be in space. In this environment, the terrestrial goods must pay the exorbitant shipping costs while space manufactured goods would pay less. So in order to justify space infrastructure, we must have space infrastructure that needs our goods. It's a difficult Catch 22. I only see a few ways around the Catch 22: 

Strange Matter If the Strange Matter hypothesis is true, then a tiny bit of strange matter would eventually destroy the Earth. 

Of course matching atmosphere to what we need would be good but as a starter planet that we can terraform, we might be able to begin with a planet with Earth normal atmospheric pressure. Humans would just require oxygen masks as long as the atmosphere wasn't corrosive or toxic. Can you think of any other valuation criteria? Has some other scientific body considered this question already? If so, what did they think? Also, I like the original Traveller RPG. It had a hex scoring of a planet based upon a variety of factors (gravity, temperature, pressure, radiation, etc.) but that valuation works better on a scalar value like pressure than it does for something as diverse as atmosphere. 

Changing the fundamental chemistry of the planet's surface would be far scarier and more dangerous to the human race than an increase in a couple of degrees of temperature. Fortunately, we see no evidence of this happening during the current era. The Oxygen environment biology has access to much more energy than the organisms evolved for the reducing atmosphere. The dominance of Aerobic organisms creates a strong feedback loops among life forms help stabilize the system and ensure that as long as Earth teams with life that life will work to ensure we don't seen another event like the Oxygen Catastrophe.

FTL Options Once again there is no way to prevent its use as a weapon but there is a concept that might be difficult to use as a weapon. Alcubierre Drive 

Your breach must be strong enough for the powder load - or your gun blows up in your hand, killing you. Your breech tolerances must be tight enough that the powder doesn't blow out the breach instead of the pushing the projectile down the barrel - or your shot blows hot burning gun powder back into the face of the person wielding the gun, blinding you. 

Exotic Flora/Fauna (Plants & Animals) Biodiversity Generally jungle/swamp regions have higher biodiversity. So if you need or want exotic biological materials (e.g. for potion making), then the swamps could be very valuable indeed. Mineral Wealth Generally mining for minerals in a swamp is a losing proposition, however, a couple of exceptions to this rule are known. Gold Mine If the swamp filled/flooded an extinct volcanic caldera, much mineral wealth might lie below the swamp. A formation similar to that described exists in the US state of North Carolina and was the source of the only major gold mining on the US East Coast. Iron (et al) Mine Furthermore, biological action in some swamps concentrates elements like iron (see bog iron). Strategic Location If for example, two major landmasses are connected by a swampy land bridge, then it isn't so much the swamp as the location that you will want to keep. 

Having your cake and eating it too Your question makes it very clear that you do NOT want to consider nuclear power. Since you are presumably writing fiction, this means you can basically write into your story anything you want. You can claim humans found magnetic monopoles, flubber, or can use clean Zero Point Energy. None of these are actually real or viable as a means to power a space ship but if you insist on no-nuclear, you'll have to use some form of handwavium (aka McGuffinite) to do it. 

During special times, governments have severely limited "normal" activities to devote more effort towards the "special" activities (think rationing during WWII). So you saying assume infinite money, is the equivalent of saying assume infinite labor and resources. Which limits us only to what our current state of science says is practical. The case of the Pyramid 100 km tall Lets look at your case, a pyramid 100 km tall. Our materials and structural knowledge are immensely greater than ancient Egypt's. But I don't need to know the materials that we'd use in such a pyramid because I can look at the Earth for equivalent natural formations and find none. Why is this? Because under immense pressure, the Earth's materials flow like plastic. If you built a big enough structure, you'd cause the crustal plate it had been built on to begin sinking into the Earth (the concept is called Isostacy). As a very rough approximation, I'd look at the tallest natural structures and use that as the order of magnitude guess maximum size of man-made structures. So perhaps 10km is doable given infinite man-power and resources but it couldn't get much taller. Other Candidate Projects I've also thought that megastructures on Earth weren't all that interesting, so I included some other projects that I'd expend our infinite labor and resources upon:
