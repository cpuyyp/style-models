The Hubble Ultra Deep Field (HUDF) has approximately 10,000 objects in it. Between 25 and 50 of them are identified as extremely faint stars. That means the remaining ~10,000 objects are galaxies. To answer your question literally then, the green objects are galaxies. However, I believe what you probably really mean to ask is, why are these galaxies green? To answer that, there are actually a number of points to address. 

The answer here, technically, is no. The reason being that once it requires a speed greater than or equal to the speed of light to escape your object, it is necessarily a black hole. That is the definition of a black hole. So that means this neutron star you propose is actually a black hole. Another equivalent definition of a black hole is any object whose mass is concentrated inside that object's event horizon. But you might still ask, could you have a black hole where the mass inside the event horizon is not a singularity. This would require some sort of support to prevent the matter from collapsing down to the singularity. The answer to this is that it is currently unknown. The problem is that inside event horizons, suddenly you need to work with both GR and quantum field theory but those two theories don't play nice. Instead you should be using a Quantum Gravity theory but this theory hasn't been developed. So ultimately any answer to this would be a guess until this theory gets fully fleshed out. 

Rob Jeffries gives a good response to this question, but I wanted to go through the basic outline of how the age of the universe is calculated, just so you can see how it works more or less. Be warned though, I'm only giving you the highlights and you'll either have to accept what I'm saying or fill in the blanks yourself. The Friedmann Equation As with anything in physics, when you want to analyze something, you need an equation to represent it. Think of the Friedmann Equation as the "equation of the universe". It's kind of crazy (to me) to believe, but yes there is an equation that represents the entire universe. The Friedmann equation is directly derived from the GR field equations, however it is quite possible to derive them from Newtonian mechanics (and a little hand waving). A good source for the Newtonian derivation can be found in Ryden's Indroduction to Cosmology, which is a good undergraduate level cosmology textbook. There are many forms of the Friedmann equation1 and it can be represented numerous ways (especially depending on the universe model), but I think a convenient form is the following: $$\bigg(\frac{\dot{a}}{a}\bigg)^2 = H_0^2 \Big(\Omega_{m,0}a^{-3} + \Omega_{r,0}a^{-4} + \Omega_{\Lambda,0} + \Omega_{k,0}a^{-2}\Big) \equiv H_0^2E^2(a)$$ The terms in this equation are defined as follows. 

Such a planet is certainly massive enough to have cleared out its orbit under normal circumstances. For reference, Neptune has a mass of $17\:M_\oplus$ while Uranus has a mass of $14.5\:M_\oplus$. The special feature of this planet is that it is located $700\:AU$ distant from the Sun which is in a very ambiguous and unknown region of our solar system. It is not clear at all how much, if any, debris in the form of comets resides out there. There are models suggesting a disk (referred to as the Hills Cloud) exists at those distances, implying that this new planet could reside inside an extended cometary disk. Of course this is only speculation, but it is a distinct possibility. If the above-mentioned disk exists, we have to consider a few scenarios. 

This question is a bit tricky because it's uncertain as to what counts as "discovering" an exoplanet. Today, we count an exoplanet as having been discovered if it can be detected either by two separate techniques or three separate transits (if found via the transit method). Some of the very very early hunts for exoplanets did indeed find them, but many of their initial results were dubious or questionable (and sometimes wrong) and weren't really confirmed until much later. So do you count a planet as being discovered when it was first potentially detected or do you not count it until its been completely confirmed? First Exoplanet Detection The very first time someone could claim they discovered an exoplanet was in 1988. The astronomers Bruce Campbell, G. A. H. Walker, and Stephenson Yang announced that they had discovered a planet around the star Gamma Cephei using the radial velocity method. However, their results were not that great since, at the time, the detection was at the threshold of their technological capabilities and their results weren't entirely believable. It wasn't until years later that this planet was actually confirmed as existing. Whether you count this as the first real exoplanet discovery or not depends on what you define as a discovery, given that the actual confirmation didn't come until years after the first detection. First Confirmed Exoplanet Detection In 1992, Aleksander Wolszczan and Dale Frail managed to find and confirm a planet around a the pulsar PSR B1257+12, again with the radial velocity method. At this time, their measurements were good enough to be believed and so considered "confirmed". First Confirmed Exoplanet Detection Around a Main-Sequence Star This case is particularly called out because it was the first time an exoplanet was detected and confirmed to exist around a normal main-sequence star. This occurred in 1995 around the star 51 Pegasi. This discovery was made by Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz. Many people would consider this the first "true" exoplanet discovery and will cite this case if you ask when the first exoplanet discovery was made. 

I'm not saying this is the case with the galaxies in the HUDF, but some galaxies actually are green! A few examples include the Pea Galaxy or the Green Bean Galaxy. When you plot up galaxies based on color (note that this is the astronomical definition of color which doesn't necessarily have a 1-1 correspondence with visual color) you get a Color-Magnitude diagram (CMD) wherein most galaxies are clumped into a red portion or a blue portion. However, there are a small group of galaxies in what is known as the Green Valley which do appear green for one reason or another. What actually causes their greenness, I think, is beyond the scope of this question and would be better suited for a new question. 

There are multiple solutions to general relativity which allow for multiple different types of black holes. The "normal" black hole you see most people talk about, with a zero-volume, point singularity, is known as the Schwarzchild black hole. If the black hole is spinning, the Schwarzchild solution no longer applies and you're talking about a different type of black hole. This new type is referred to as a Kerr black hole (other types include the Reissner-Nordstrom and the Kerr-Newman). In a Kerr black hole, the singularity at the center is still zero-volume, but it is no longer a point. Instead it is a disk of zero height, often referred to as a ring singularity or "Ringularity". The angular momentum of the spinning black hole is then the angular momentum around the axis of rotation passing through this ring.
