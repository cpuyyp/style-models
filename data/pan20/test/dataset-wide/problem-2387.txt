'Sadhu' means good. So you can say 'Sadhu' back. Here in Sri Lanka we commonly say "Theruwan Saranai", which means "May the noble triple gem be your refuge". 

First Noble Truth: saṃkhittena pañc·upādāna·k·khandhā dukkhā - In short, the five aggregates of clinging is suffering. If all mental activities cease at death, there will be no craving after death as it is clearly a mental activity. If that's the case, apart from craving, the second noble truth should include things like breathing, eating, drinking, checking for vehicles before crossing the road and pretty much anything else that keeps you alive. The third noble truth(s) would be both Nibbana and death. Apart from the noble eightfold path that one needs to practice with years of dedication, the fourth noble truth(s) would include hanging yourself, shooting yourself, drowning, starving to death, death by lethal injection, sleeping on a railway, jumping from a skyscraper or pretty much doing whatever you like until you end up dead. Imagine a criminal with such a belief saying "I became a serial killer so the government would make me enlightened by capital punishment." Such a religion would mainly provide laughter to people instead of being taken seriously. :) 

Sure! Wisdom need not be associated with compassion. Ex: take each of the 16 Vipassana Nanas. Those mind states have nothing to do with compassion. Some of them are associated with fear towards Samsara. Wisdom can also come as disappointment towards sensual pleasures. Read the story of Upatissa & Kolitha who later became the chief disciples of the Buddha. Even the four stages of enlightenment don't have compassion as a quality. To reach enlightenment, one needs to cultivate the Five Spiritual Faculties: 

No! All Sammasambuddhas are equal in their attainment of Buddhahood. They are all omniscient, equal in virtue, concentration and wisdom. However the time they take to cultivate Paramitha might vary from Bodhisatva to Bodhisatva. There are three classes of Bodhisattvas, namely; Intellectual Bodhisattvas (Pannadhika), Devotional Bodhisattvas (Saddhadhika) and Energetic Bodhisattas (Viriyadhika). The minimum time it takes to become a Buddha after getting the confirmation from another Buddha is called "Sara Asankya Kalpa Lakshaya". Intellectual Bodhisattas take the minimum time. Our Buddha was an intellectual Bodhisatta. Saddhadhika Bodhisattas take double that time. Viriyadhika Bodhisattas take 4 times the minimum time required. Buddha Maitreya who will appear in the future is said to be a Viriyadhika Bodhisatta. But after attaining Buddhahood they are all equal. Apart from that, there are 30 similarities and 8 dissimilarities. The dissimilarities are not directly related to Buddhahood. Ex: The tree under which they attain enlightenment, the life span, parents, wife, chief disciples, whether there's a Vinaya pitaka etc. Read the Buddhawamsa for more details. 

The Buddha himself is beyond all gods. He is referred to as 'Satta deva manussanam' which means, he is the teacher to gods and humans. The word deva refers to both the gods and brahmas. And in that field he was incomparable. He was the supreme teacher and a vast number of gods, brahmas and human beings received his teachings, his advice, his guidance and they liberated themselves from this mass of suffering as a result of that. 

The 3rd precept doesn't prevent you from getting remarried. So as long as you don't steal another man's wife, it should be fine. 

Mild version of Dosa would be the mild aversion that may arise in a Sakadagami. Mild version of Moha would be the conceit, restlessness and ignorance of an Anagami. 

Resisting or protecting what you have is not forbidden. But you shouldn't kill. It is perfectly fine to say no to someone who is trying to take advantage of you. It's perfectly fine to have a non-lethal security system for your house. That does not get in the way of Brahmavihara. 

Once you become married, you are the guardian of your partner. So you do not break the 3rd precept regardless of where you live. Parents continue to support you out of the goodness of their hearts. It does not make them your guardians once you become adults. They can kick you out at any time and be in the right. 

Identifying that you are doing something wrong and doing it right is called wisdom. Not desire. For example, coming to the realization that drinking is not the answer to your problems and stopping it is wisdom. It's stopping of wrongdoing. Craving in itself is wrongdoing. Not craving is stopping of that wrongdoing. 

By realising that whatever it is you haven't had in life, it's not going to be anything other than seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, touching and thinking. In other words, the five aggregates. So it becomes all encompassing, when you see that the five aggregates are impermanent, unsatisfactory and uncontrollable. 

Arahathhood does not depend on the ability to remember. It depends on whether there are defilements in the mind or not. You can slice and dice and french fry the brain, but if there's something missing in the mind, it's never going to magically appear from nowhere. 

It depends on the definition of 'bad'. It's like asking why is 'oak' a tree? Or why is 'rice' a food? According to the dictionary, 'bad' is explained as "not good", 'evil', "inferior in quality", "below standard", "not satisfactory". All those terms can be associated with 'suffering'. 

Light vs darkness is a better analogy to wisdom vs ignorance than happiness vs suffering. What you describe as happiness and suffering are just experiences. They belong to the Sankhara group in the five aggregates of clinging. Nibbana exists independently of the five aggregates. All experiences, whether they are pleasurable, painful or neutral, fall under the first Noble truth. So they all have the inherent nature of Dukkha. Nibbana is non-experiential and devoid of Dukkha. 

When you plant a mango seed and a mango plant comes out of it, what do you call it? Rebirth or the resurrection of the parents mango tree? Certainly not! The term 'rebirth' can be used at a conceptual level to tell a story, when we are not really focusing on whether or not there's a self or a soul. But it's inappropriate to use it when you are discussing ultimate realities. ex: "Julia went to sleep last night. Julia woke up this morning". That's how we tell a story. But there's no 'Julia' in reality. Julia is just a concept. In reality, it is just the five aggregates which is always changing. So the Julia who woke up this morning is not the same Julia who went to sleep last night. 

No, it means to give up the clinging towards eyes and sights since they are neither you nor yours. As a result, eyes and eye contact cannot cause you to be reborn again in Samsara. 

They are not the same. But Suñña is one aspect of Anatta. Suñña can mean devoid of any inherent value, goodness or a soul. Anatta means not under one's control. Something that is Anatta isn't always Suñña. ex: Nibbana. Nibbana is peaceful, devoid of suffering and permanent. So there's goodness to it. But it's still not a self or a soul since it's not under your control. There are 40 meditative objects described in Patisambidhamagga under Vipassana meditation. Ten kinds from the view-point of anicca; twenty-five kinds from the view-point of dukkha; five kinds from the view-point of anatta. Suñña is one of those 40. The detailed explanations are in Visuddhimagga. 

Having loved ones or pleasurable company is Vipaka(results) of good Karma. The departing of loved ones or withering away of pleasant experiences come under the first noble truth. You getting sad about it is the Vipaka(result) of bad mental Karma of clinging to loved ones or pleasant experiences. 

No, this has nothing to do with Nibbana. You have to do Vipassana meditation for insight knowledge. But being able to sit for 3 hours and focus on one object is good progress in terms of Samatha meditation. Also, having such focus is a good starting point for Vipassana. 

Study the Tipitaka, the Commentaries and see if what they teach is consistent with the books. Usually if someone is criticizing Abhidhamma in order to accommodate his/her views, it's a good indication that they have deviated from the original spirit of Buddhism. Regarding the Commentaries, a teacher might say "This is what the commentary says regarding this incident, but this is my personal view". That is reasonable. But if he degrades venerable Buddhagosa or other authors of the commentaries, that's a good indication to look for a new teacher. 

"heart of good will" here means practicing Metta meditation. As the Sutta clearly states, Velama Brahmin was not impressed by the recipients. He didn't think they were worthy. So he would have given those gifts inattentively, disrespectfully, not with one's own hand, as if throwing it away, with the view that nothing will come of it. He would've just done it to show off his wealth. Even today we have people spending large amounts of money just to make a statement. Also, I would imagine that the recipients were making a big commotion, pushing each other to the side with greedy hands to grab as much as they can. No thoughts of Metta comes to the mind when you see that, unless you have trained your mind with Metta meditation. 

To a Buddhist, the word 'manliness' usually means something completely different than what you think. To a Buddhist, 'manliness' means the ability to swim against the current. Not to get swept away by it. This is called "patisothagami patipada". The ordinary worldling is weak and easily defeated by the current of craving. Craving is their master and they spend most of their lives doing it's bidding like obedient slaves. This is one reason why the Buddha is considered the pinnacle of manliness as he swam against the current and reached highest point of humanity. I.e. the Buddhahood. From a physical point of view, manliness is defined by the 32 great bodily features of a great man. 

A woman cannot be a Sammasabuddha, Pacceka Buddha, Maha Brahma, Devaputta Māra , god Sakka or a Cakkavatti. Even if a woman aspires to become a Buddha in the future, she won't get the Niyatha Vivarana(confirmation) by another Buddha until she's born as a man. - MN 115. This might not sit well with the modern social standards which are big on gender equality. But that's how it is when it comes to laws of nature. As a side note, Theravada tradition does not drop/add or change Suttas to fit well with the social standards of the time. That's one reason why it is still the tradition that is closest to the original teachings of the Buddha. 

Buddhas do as they proclaim, so once the Sasana is well established, the lord would not extend life without an invitation as Buddhas do not have the desire to live on. Besides, venerable Ananda was the one attending to the Buddha. So it is only proper that the Buddha hinted it to him. Also, it was always going to be someone who has not yet attained Arahanthship that should invite the Buddha to stay on as Arahanths have already achieved what needs to be achieved and do not require the Buddha to stay. Buddhists do not believe in determinism. The future is not fixed in all situations. Only some things can be predicted to happen for sure. The Mara stopping venerable Ananda from inviting the Buddha was not destined to happen. He would have invited if he was able to overcome Mara at that time. In any case, the word Kalpa here means an Ayu-Kalpa. Which means the Buddha would have lived 120 years at most, even if ven. Ananda had invited.

So punching someone in the nose does not break the 1st precept. But it weakens it. Since the question is if it's against(not if it breaks) the precept, the answer is yes. Weakening here means the merits you acquire by keeping to first precept are reduced or weakened. Also, when it comes to the consequences of Kamma, Killing results in one having a short life span if born as a human again. Just injuring or torturing results in having bad health if born as a human again. killing usually involves inflicting pain or torturing as well. So it can result in bad health too. 

This is wrong! The agreed upon definition is that when you take the triple refuge you are considered a Buddhist. Yes, it is possible to become a Buddhist without a formal teacher as long as you understand taking refuge in the Triple gem. After that, the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha are your teachers. Here are five ways to take refuge in the Triple Gem as per the Visuddhimagga: 

Buddhists believe in rebirth, gods, ghosts, hells, heavens, Karma. Atheists don't! Paticca Samuppada, the Four Noble Truth and the Noble Eightfold Path are not taught in other religions. Different religions have different concepts of enlightenment. What Buddhism teaches as 'Nibbana' can only be achieved by following the Noble Eightfold Path and realizing the 4 Noble Truths. Nibbana is the deathless element. It is a permanent, peaceful state which is soulless. I don't think you get that definition in other religions. 

Metta meditation can help as it subdues hatred which is a major cause for suicide. Other Samatha meditations like Anapanasati can help to attain extremely pleasant states of the mind like the Jhanas where there's no depression. Vipassana can be practiced to make one not react to unpleasant feelings or thoughts and eventually achieve lasting peace. 

The brain is matter(Rupa). If the defilements are caused by the brain, a being should attain Nibbana when he dies as the brain stops functioning. If Nibbana is caused by the brain, a Sotapanna being should lose his attainment when he dies. According to Buddhism, neither is true. So your assumption is not compatible with Buddhism. 

It's possible to be a Buddhist who is striving not to be overcome by misanthropic thoughts. Misanthropy is a product of aversion. Thinking to destroy human kind or wishing harm to even one person is simply hate. If Metta meditation fails, try to see the world in terms of momentary experiences, not in terms of entities or individuals. 

It depends on what you mean by wisdom. By wisdom, if you mean intelligence as well, it can be dangerous and cruel. ex: coming up with more effective ways to invade countries, deceive people to make more profit etc. But wisdom from a Buddhist perspective can be seen as two fold. 

Have you seen Lotus buds come out of the mud and blossom into beautiful flowers? Just because you are born into a bad family background, you are not destined to become a bad person. Those who are born into good family backgrounds also become bad persons. ex: Prince Ajatasattu the son of the enlightened king Bimbisara. Future is not written on stone and not always shaped by past actions. The decisions you make here and now play a big role in what is going to come to pass. Anyways, if you are a bad person in this life, it is highly unlikely that you will be born as a human next time. Once you go below human, it's hard to come back up as you lack intelligence to make wholesome decisions. In that case, one would usually keep going down until one's significant bad Karma is exhausted and a good Karma from the past gets a chance to give results. 

"Romantic relationship" implies lust and craving. So the answer is no. If it is just Metta, it should be called a 'friendship'. Not a romantic relationship.
