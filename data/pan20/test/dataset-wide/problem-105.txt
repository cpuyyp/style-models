The Hrimfaxi, an Empire building race are not just trying to take the land, they are trying to build an empire and assimilate the Earth into their own culture - They are trying to save the humans from their own crazy anarchic freedom-loving ways, not wipe them out! To bring them into the superior, structured, warm, welcoming peaceful bosom of the empire. Unfortunately, there is a segment of the human population who fight back and are ruining it for the rest of them. Once those misguided barbarians who poison the human race are destroyed, the remaining humans will see the superiority of the Hrimfaxi and rejoice in a modern civilisation, free of negative thought! Every rose has its thorn, as they say. Also if your own soldiers are mindless drones, then you'll probably have less qualms about losing them to the human fight-back and more determined to properly conquer the humans. 

If you're willing to accept Futurama-like soft science (It's the future so we can do it), then you could construct a number of large solar sails bound to the equator and have the sun drive the earth like mill... 

You could make it so that the most powerful mages are considered to be sort of toffee-nosed, airy fairy, pie-in-the-sky people, out of touch with the ordinary people, locked away in their universities and parliaments debating higher philosophy, and thinking high opinions of themselves. Sort of like the legal / political professions in real life (or at least how they are stereotypically regarded) - yes the law and politics affect us all, and form the bedrock of society, but most of us aren't practitioners and that hasn't made us redundant. The vast majority of people could go their entire lives without ever thinking about what some senator or lord or supreme-court judge thinks, even though what they say and the decisions they make end up affecting society and those people. So while all females can perform magic, they are, as you say, at different levels - commoners are able to do magic, but only stuff like simple tasks, kind of "magician" level - stuff that helps them with their day-to-day life. The more accomplished they become, the more interested (and encouraged by their peers) they are in magical academia and their magical accomplishments. They become more interested in angels dancing on the head of a pin than fixing your car. The upshot of this is that men are still highly relevant in every-day life. 

One of the biggest problems in large companies with moving forward with technology is legacy programming. In this case, it could be that once upon a time, humans and robots had to work together and the robots had to be programmed to speak and understand English (maybe the humans vastly outnumbered the robots). However, over time, more and more of the various tasks gradually became automated, with robots replacing the odd human here and there. These robots needed to communicate with the ones already there and the remaining humans, and so also needed to speak English. By the time the industry was fully automated, the majority of the robots already in place already spoke English so for any new ones to fit into the system, they needed to speak English also. By this stage, it would be far too expensive to upgrade / replace all the older robots as well as develop a new protocol that would allow them all to communicate as well as do their jobs. EDIT As well as this, some of the older managers / employees like the idea of being able to get reports on progress, status updates and possibly even opinions from the robots in English and would resist having to sift through an Excel report even if it delivered better / more detailed data. 

This may be a possible scenario: Protection of the eye is more important a) stereoscopic vision is not particularly important in their environment for some reason, for example if they don't have to do much hunting or fighting and most of their food comes from plants which could be easily identified and foraged. Perhaps they have good passive defenses (like a Hedgehog's spikes or just really tough armour) which discourages predators. Or perhaps the evolution of their brain could never get the hang of processing it. b) the eye could perceive EM frequencies that penetrate objects that would be opaque to us. (e.g. they have X-ray vision) and their environment has a lot of waves of these frequencies flying around. They'll need it because... c) protection of the eye is so important that it's buried deep within their tough and thick skull and only have a single aperture into the skull to see through. Perhaps they are vulnerable to sand-storms or small flying pests. (Though as has been pointed out, redundancy is good protection too, maybe in their environment, it's not as good). Trying to peer through a narrow hole would not be much good for an eye, but they get their peripheral vision (albeit not as clear but still useful to a limited degree) from (b) above. They have limited vision through their skull. This hole is the only point of entry to the inside of the skull that doesn't go through bone, so having just a single one (and therefore a single eye) makes all of the contents of the skull easier to protect. 

You could have a very loose fitting blanket with sleeves. The sleeves would be wide enough so that when lying on the ground, the centaur could step into each of them and feet would be touching the ground. The centaur pulls it up at the front, and then reaches down to each side and throws each side over his back (Perhaps they are a little weighted to ease the throwing) and using a strap pulls it up from behind over his tail - there is a hole or short sleeve for his tail to fit through which he can manage after a bit of practice. A system of draw-strings or long laces which are routed throughout the garment (so the ends are all reachable from or near the front) would be used to tighten the garment over his back and around his legs. To undress, he loosens all the laces and drops down and steps out of the front. There is an elastic component which pulls back the entire garment once the laces are undone and released pulling it back over his back. After that it's just a matter of shaking it off his hind legs. To use the toilet, there is a long zip along the bottom with a strap, which can be pulled either through the middle of his front legs, or over his back to open or close. Not really sure how he wipes though... 

The government has their own magic users I know the people at large hate the magic users and the government might be even in power thanks to agreeing with this. But governments and authorities can be a practical, and even hypocritical lot. Just as casinoes sometimes hire former cheats to try and spot cheating taking place on their premises, the government could hire their own loyal and powerful mages to keep down the other magic users. Of course this leaves the problem of how to explain to the people why they are employing wizards while at the same time trying to repress them. This is all about "spin" - i.e. propaganda. Governments are good at this sort of thing. This doesn't sound like the most democratic of governments so this shouldn't be too much of a problem. But then how do they prevent their own mages from siding with the magic users they are trying to control? - A couple of options:
