Many philosophers of physics and quite a few theoretical physicists don't see a bright line between the two fields. Philosophers of physics often have at least an undergraduate degree in physics and regularly attend physics conferences; some also collaborate with theoretical physicists. Many physicists are hostile to philosophy, either because of a "shut up and calculate" attitude or because they're ignorant about philosophy. But other physicists enjoy engaging with philosophers. For example, a friend of mine is a philosopher of cosmology. She's currently finishing up a postdoc that was jointly supervised by a philosopher of science and an astrophysicist. During her postdoc, she was trained how to take observations at a telescope in South America and wrote a few papers on dark matter with the astrophysicist and other members of his team. From this perspective, you don't necessarily have to choose between physics and philosophy of physics. If you're putting together a reading list for your own personal edification, then feel free to read books and papers from both. If you're trying to choose an undergraduate degree, then double major (in North America) or look for a program of study that includes both physics and philosophy. If you're trying to choose a graduate degree, the institutional difference is more important â€” career trajectories and opportunities can be very different. In that case, look for programs and particular advisors who regularly collaborate across the disciplinary divide and have a strong record of placing recent graduate students in the kind of academic career you're interested in. Reach out to them by email to get more information about the program, their current research interests, whether you might be a good fit, and so on. 

You ask if it's "absurd" for sets to have two features: (a) a capability to be empty and (b) a capability to contain other sets. With that said, I'm not really sure what you mean by absurd, but you could mean two distinct things: logically incoherent (or inconsistent) OR non-intuitive. If your question is about logical coherence or consistency, the answer is simple: all well-thought-out set theories (like ZFC) are logically coherent. There are many proofs that take care of this. So, as far as we know, there are no logical inconsistencies as far as empty sets or sets of sets are concerned. If your question is about intuition, then it becomes semantically-loaded -- and NOT a question about logic (but maybe about meta-logic). I would argue that the number zero has about as much intuitive force as an empty set: that is, almost none. Negative numbers have even less intuitive force behind them and let's not even bring up imaginary numbers. I'm not familiar with Geldsetzer, but there is a lot of extra work that needs to be done if one wants to show that empty sets and sets-of-sets are not helpful. One couldn't simply say "well it doesn't make sense!". If that were the case, Mary could, just the same, claim that "imaginary numbers make no sense" and there would go an entire field of mathematics (namely, complex analysis). 

The central chapters of my dissertation (available at $URL$ are about two different ways of understanding the aims of science. quen_tin's answer is fine as far as it goes, but on my analysis there's an even deeper disagreement. Science produces a variety of different goods. Very generally, these can be grouped into three categories: 

Since the author doesn't explain what they mean by a rights-based ethics, it's a little hard to tell. But rights are often understood as only "negative rights," what you call "rights to be left alone in doing certain acts." Ever since Isaiah Berlin's "Two Concepts of Liberty," academic political philosophers frequently associate "positive rights" with "positive liberty," and are at least hesitant to see entitlements (say, to a minimum income or health care) in terms of rights. For example, in John Rawls' A Theory of Justice, redistribution is justified by the difference principle rather than notions of liberty or rights. Some libertarian philosophers argue explicitly that rights must only be understood as negative rights. By contrast, public discourse about rights often includes both positive and negative rights. For example, right now proponents of universal public health care in the US often frame their argument in terms of a right to health care. Since the author is an academic philosopher, it's probably safe to assume that they're assuming that rights are only negative rights. "Positive rights" would be understood as duties; so members of my community have a duty to provide me with enough food for me to survive, but this isn't a (negative) right to food. 

Would this question perplex you as much as your original one? Probably not. The correct color simply isn't a choice. This question is just as unanswerable as yours - no more no less. Why your question seems more interesting is because it makes a key assumption (just like the first incarnation of the Liar Paradox question did - namely, that a statement is either true or false). Specifically, it makes the assumption that the probability of getting a correct answer is 50%. This is incorrect. The probability is, I would argue, mathematically indeterminate. Consider E2: 

The truth table TbA for A will have 2n rows. The truth tree TtA for A has an unbounded number of open branches. 

You're asking about reductionism in biology. If you read the introduction to that article, you'll see a distinction between ontological, methodological, and epistemic reduction. Ontological reduction can be true even if methodological and epistemic reduction are false: it can be true that living organisms are "nothing more than" certain arrangements of fundamental physical entities, and yet this relationship is so complex that it's practically impossible for us to reduce biology to chemistry, much less fundamental physics. As I understand it, in medicine and bioethics the beginning and end of life are usually defined in terms of brain activity. Ontologically, is brain activity "nothing more than" certain arrangements of fundamental physical entities? Maybe. But notice that we don't determine time of death by examining the state of such entities. So someone might argue that we determine time of death by examining the state of a biological organ. On this view, life might be ontologically reducible, but not methodologically or epistemically. 

Probably the major (non-ancient) innovator of logic pre-Boole/Frege was Peter of Spain. He lived during the 13th century and wrote the Tractatus. This was not only a rehashing of ancient logics, but was also the basis of a tradition that would last almost 600 years. Since the Tractatus was ubiquitously used as a logic textbook for centuries, I would say that Peter of Spain probably made a more lasting impact on the logical landscape than Aristotle himself. To find out more, I strongly suggest reading Peter of Spain: Summaries of Logic. It is written by three heavy-weights of Medieval philosophy: Calvin Normore, Brian Copenhaver, and Terrence Parsons. For what it's worth, I've had the honor of taking classes with all three of them and saying they are brilliant is an understatement. 

Arguably this narrative is oversimplified. "Theistic evolutionists," like Asa Gray have argued that evolution by natural selection is compatible with the existence of God and a divine plan. (Roughly, the idea is that God sets a plan, then uses evolution to achieve it.) Natural selection is only one form of evolution. It's not clear how compelling the argument from design was pre-Darwin. And there's a lot of contemporary work in philosophy of biology on how we should understand biological function-talk (the purpose of the heart is to pump blood, gene XYZ is for this phenotypical trait). 

As written, your question seems to assume that someone is an important philosopher of science only if they're mentioned in one particular Stanford Encyclopedia article. Both Feyerabend and Quine have entire articles of their own. There's been relatively little work on the demarcation problem in professional philosophy of science over the past 30 years or so. The SEPh article's gloss on Laudan (1983) pretty much sums up where most professional philosophers are these days: "there is no hope of finding a necessary and sufficient criterion of something as heterogeneous as scientific methodology." I can't think of any recent work on Quine and demarcation off the top of my head. But there's been an active debate between Ian James Kidd and Massimo Pigliucci over the past year (see here here here and here). Briefly, Kidd has very actively been promoting renewed attention to Feyerabend's work, arguing that Feyerabend's positions are much more reasonable than his contemporary critics made them seem, and indeed that Feyerabend's positions are often very similar to some mainstream feminist and pragmatist positions today. This includes defending Feyerabend from the charge that he advocated pseudoscience in an infamous defense of astrology. (For a list of Kidd's papers and books on Feyerabend, see here.) On the other hand, Pigliucci has been trying to revive work on the demarcation problem; I think he's motivated by the trope that there's a crisis in public confidence in science, and thinks that solving the demarcation problem can restore this confidence. Astrology is one of the standard examples of pseudoscience, so of course he didn't want to let a defense of astrology go completely unanswered. On Pigliucci's view, pseudoscience is a family resemblance concept, roughly characterized by a combination of low empirical support and theoretical articulation (see here). This debate attracted a little attention, but it's too recent to tell whether it's going to amount to an important new chapter in work on the demarcation problem. Since the SEPh article on demarcation is only three years old, it's not surprising that it doesn't include a debate that happened last year. 

To answer (A), I will point you to Planck time, which is a theoretical lower bound on the smallest possible time duration if one should exist. (B) is obviously much more difficult to answer. As a primer, I would direct you to Nick Bostrom's seminal Oxford paper in which he discusses the Simulation Argument. You'll notice that his discussion is underpinned by various stochastic arguments, and not so much on the hypothetical simulation having particular kinds of features (e.g. discreteness). In fact, having these kinds of constraints on the simulation is probably counterproductive. 

Let's look at the last line marked with an asterisk. will yield per Table 1. Similarly, as well as will also yield per Table 1. So, no matter how we decide to commute, we will have to deal with an and the remaining . And will always yield a per Table 1. This is why we observe the odd-even alternation of truth values when all operands are true. It turns out that you don't want to use a in examples like the one in your OP. What you actually want to do is something like or (via DeMorgans) . There is no logical connective that does this since this would require an n-ary connector, e.g. something like which would only work as a function in FOL. Here is an interesting paper discussing the ternary exclusive or. 

It's difficult to answer your question about postmodernism, for a couple of reasons. First, the term "postmodernism" is used extremely equivocally: sometimes it refers strictly to a movement of late twentieth-century French philosophers (Derrida, Deleuze, Lyotard, Irigaray); sometimes it also includes Heidegger, Nietzsche, Freud, certain readings of Marx and Hegel, or any feminist philosopher. So it's not clear whose views of science you're asking about. Second, even the strict-sense postmodernists had very different views on science. Deleuze saw himself as providing a new metaphysics for science, following Bergson; when Lyotard rejects "metanarratives" in The Postmodern Condition, he's primarily targeting science. If I recall correctly, Gary Gutting's French Philosophy in the Twentieth Century discusses both of their views (and has a great chapter on prewar French philosophy of science). The view that the value of science comes from the way it lets us do things is historically associated with Francis Bacon. If anything Bacon was just barely pre-modern! In the nineteenth and twentieth century, it's associated with logical empiricism â€” especially Otto Neurath â€” and American pragmatism â€” especially John Dewey. For a discussion of the relationship between logical empiricism and pragmatism, check out George Reisch's How the Cold War Transformed Philosophy of Science. For work by contemporary philosophers of science, I recommend Nancy Cartwright's "Well-Ordered Science: Evidence for Use" and Matt Brown's book-in-progress. 

If S is made up of infinite strokes, as you presented your question, its cardinality is â„µ0 So, the set S is countably infinite This also means that the set â„˜(S) is not countable since |â„˜(S)| = 2â„µ0 which, assuming continuum hypothesis, is equivalent to â„µ1 Ergo, all possible subsets of S (otherwise known as â„˜(S)) are not countable; keep in mind that 2â„µ0 > â„µ0 which is the same thing as â„µ1 > â„µ0 

The first column being the 'inclination of the will.' It's also of note to say that, according to Aquinas, in case , the agent is responsible for his actions, whereas in case , he is not. Lets go back to your original question; if you agree with Aquinas, you don't really 'influence' anything, anyway. It's as if you make the coercee your puppet (you control them but 100% of the responsibility falls on you). "But how far can we go without coercing?" you may ask. Aquinas makes a very interesting distinction. He argues that anything non-violent cannot be construed as coercive. So you could technically threaten, terrorize, or otherwise non-violently 'influence' someone to do your bidding and Aquinas would say two things: a) it's not coercion (yay!), and b) the agent is, in fact, 100% responsible for the actions they may take. 

In discussions of appeal to ignorance, one common distinction is between "absence of evidence" and "evidence of absence." "Absence of evidence" means that no or very little evidence is available either way (neither for nor against the proposition in question). Is there life on Europa? We don't yet have evidence either way, so concluding that there is life on Europe would be fallacious. There's a lack or absence of evidence. "Evidence of absence" means that there is evidence that something isn't there. We've looked for life on the Moon, and gathered enough negative evidence to be reasonably confident that there is indeed no life there. There's sufficient evidence to conclude that life is absent on the Moon. There are at least two complications worth mentioning here. I'll illustrate this with a chemical safety testing example. Suppose we want to know whether chemical X causes cancer. We've run one small study, in lab rats, and the effect was not statistically significant. First, the basic difference between "absence of evidence" and "evidence of absence" is whether we have "sufficient" evidence, or can draw "reasonable" conclusions. But different people may want to use different standards for sufficient evidence. The manufacturer of chemical X might claim â€” based on the one small study in lab rats â€” that we have sufficient evidence to conclude that chemical X does not cause cancer. They see this as a case of "evidence of absence." But environmentalists might claim that this study doesn't provide sufficient evidence to draw any conclusion. They see this as a case of "absence of evidence." Second, when we're talking about practical reason, we may have good reason to act as though a claim were true even if we don't have good reason to believe it. For example, environmentalists might maintain that we should limit the use of chemical X â€” treating it as though it did cause cancer â€” even though we don't have good reason to believe that it really does cause cancer. This doesn't mean that we should simply assume that chemical X causes cancer on the basis of no evidence. Instead, the idea is that the default position is that chemical X causes cancer, and we need sufficient evidence to conclude that it's safe. (The manufacturer, on the other hand, might argue that the default position should be that chemical X is safe, and we need sufficient evidence to conclude that it's dangerous.)
