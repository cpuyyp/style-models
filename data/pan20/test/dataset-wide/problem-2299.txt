The short answer is "bear spray"; a firearm is really not the most effective option. That said... I will assume you are looking for grizzly protection, since you didn't specify the bear and black bears are relatively shy. Again, using spray is a far more effective way of improving your odds; a review of its use in Alaska found a 98% success rate, with no fatalities. On the other hand, bringing or using a firearm does not appear to do anything to improve your odds in a bear encounter. This is likely due to a number of factors, one being that most people's aim goes totally to pieces under stress, another being that the animal is, well, a bear. On all fours it's nearly as tall as you are, it outweighs you by several hundred pounds, it's faster than most residential speed limits, and unlike many humans it doesn't freeze up or faint when shot in a non-vital area. However, since you ask, a .44 Magnum with 240 grain bullets is considered sufficient, assuming you can place your shots on target and learn to handle the recoil. (Ok, yes, this does fall into the "hand cannon" category.) Given your question, I assume you are not qualified as "expert" in terms of shooting ability. This means that if you want to be effective you will need to put in a great deal of time at the range, hopefully with a good instructor so you develop proper habits. (A good goal is 3" groups at 25 yards.) I would also strongly recommend the Herrero book below, to better understand bear behavior.

The short answer is, "it depends". Packs sold to women may have only superficial changes compared to the men's version (i.e. the color is different), but there are usually a few common differences: 

Reviewing to Table 3 from a DAV Panorama article testing belay device loads, this is comparable to other belay devices and inline with numbers reported elsewhere around the internet (~2.5kN in the closed position). Unfortunately I was unable to locate previous test reports. The positioning of the load strand relative to the spine tends to vary across the literature, in some cases both forms may be depicted in the same book. There are potential arguments for either position; the strongest in my opinion being that having the brake strand closest to the spine keeps it from inadvertently rolling over and unscrewing the gate of the carabiner. (Or the gate may have edges that could damage the running rope.) Testing done on the clove hitch (a structurally similar knot) show no strength benefit to placing the load strand closest to the spine. If you are using the recommended pear-shaped (or HMS) carabiner for the munter, the positioning of the load strand will tend to end up in the "belly" of the carabiner regardless of the brake strand orientation. Refer to some of the pictures here in the "Carabiner shape" section: $URL$ Side note: The Outdoor Knots Book by Clyde Soles mentions that the twists a Munter is often accused of creating comes from a case of "pilot error" -- when the brake strand is held out to the side. Keeping the rope parallel is said to reduce or prevent this. Ironically enough, other sources have listed contradictory advice. (I have no data as to which is correct.) 

Your criteria: a full day with a decent chunk of inactivity, cold but not frigid, with some precipitation. Normally when active outdoors in such weather I wear softshell pants (schoeller-type fabrics, such as Arc'teryx Gamma LT or Marmot Scree pants) and a lightweight or silkweight baselayer. This provides wind and water resistance, won't make me overheat, and will still breathe far better than "breathable" shell materials such as GoreTex. Large amounts of inactivity will call for more insulation, which can easily be increased by using a thicker baselayer (e.g. Patagonia's Cap3 or Cap4 materials), eventually moving up to fleece (e.g. Patagonia's R1 bottoms). If switching between intense activity and rest, I would use a lighter baselayer and bring insulated pants that I can throw on over everything else (or wrap up in a light down quilt). The temperature range of -10° to 5°C allows for melting snow and liquid water; thus water-absorbing fabrics such as cotton (e.g. jeans) become a particularly bad idea. If there's significant rain coming down I'd wear a waterproof shell, but once water stays in solid form such shells are much less useful. Regarding style, if you cannot find softshell pants in a style you'd be comfortable wearing around town, wool or waxed cotton (such as Fjällräven sells) are other alternatives to consider. 

Caveat: Heading out into a blizzard seems an easy way to get killed. Personally I'd only do it in dire situations. Regarding your layers: Cotton stores about 27x it's weight in water. This makes it comfortable indoors or in hot weather, but it also means it will act like a swamp cooler once you're no longer throwing off enough heat to keep it warm. Materials like polyester absorb very little water, and technical garments are designed to efficiently wick away moisture. -4°C isn't that cold, but the windchill and how fast you move also matters. If it's cold enough I'll use 100-weight fleece baselayers (similar to Patagonia's R1 or MEC's T3 grid fleece). Thin wool sweaters would probably also substitute well, or polyester long underwear. Check army surplus sites for Gen III ECWCS or PCU layers (level 1 silkweight or level 2 gridfleece) at good prices and large sizes. The current systems were designed with input from alpinists like Mark Twight and are reasonably well thought out. When moving hard I prefer a softshell over hardshells for breathability. Only if moving slow in the cold or facing heavy precipitation then the rainshell comes on. Your windbreaker probably would work for this. I generally don't need any more insulation when on the move, but if you do a high-pile fleece insulating layer is good in wet conditions and also very breathable. The warmth greatly increases when worn under a rain or wind shell. Alternatives include layers like Patagonia's Nanopuff, or a thicker sweater. Finally in my pack would be a down parka in case I was stranded. The WinterTrekking site has some good information on clothing strategies including old-school materials. Food: Unless meals are intended, I'd likely bring a pair of energy bars and some energy gel packets. Alcohol: I was amused to find sources claiming alcohol is a vasodilator (and thus would lower your core temperature) and others claiming it's a vasoconstrictor (and thus make you more vulnerable to frostbite). An article in Scientific American provides some resolution, saying "At intoxicating levels, alcohol is a vasodilator (it causes blood vessels to relax and widen), but at even higher levels, it becomes a vasoconstrictor, shrinking the vessels and increasing blood pressure, exacerbating such conditions as migraine headaches and frostbite." Of course, if I say on a public site like this that a few sips are unlikely to cause much problem, I'll probably get called out when some reader wanders into the snow, downs a six-pack, and turns himself into a corpsicle. That said, I don't consider alcohol to be emergency gear: if something has gone wrong I'm likely already operating at lower mental capacity, and adding vodka probably isn't going to help matters. Water: This will vary per person; for myself I'd take two liters at most. With the amount of water you're drinking, I'd be worried about electrolyte imbalances, so carrying some packets of electrolyte replacement powder might be wise. Your body can only process about a liter per hour in the best case, and that capacity drops when exercising as blood is redirected to working muscles. Other gear: Fire: I suggest a small cookset of canister stove, fuel, and a pot. A jetboil system would be a larger example of this; a smaller kit might include something like an Optimus Crux or Snow Peak GigaPower paired with a 600mL "pot". I wouldn't give good odds to getting a fire started inside a blizzard, but using a stove to light branches is much easier than starting with tinder. Keep a pair of Bic lights in a warm and dry place in your body. Vision: Ski goggles with a clear or high-contrast yellow lens will keep your face a bit more comfortable. Also, a quality headlamp is good to have. Shelter: An emergency bivvy that I can crawl into. For example, a Blizzard Bag or SOL Emergency Bivvy. Navigation: It sounds like you're familiar with being inside a ping pong ball. I also like having a GPS as if you lose your position the compass becomes less useful.
