The question “What do you see?”, I can answer with “A slightly reflective, black square table in a white room.” The question “What is your visual SE like?”, I might answer with “Roughly speaking, I experience a huge dark gray parallelogram with four dark gray parallel lines of similar length extending from its corners down vertically. All this, surrounded by white.” 

Now, Aristotle assumed humans, animals and even plants to be substances. But an artifact like a mechanical wall clock is not a substance for him. Obviously, if we inspect a comparatively simple/crude artifact, we may see parts of natural "stuff" like wood or metal which were forced by the artisan(s) into a special shape and then assembled in a certain way (as in said mechanical wall clock). But what about more sophisticated, modern artifacts? A CPU, for example doesn't show (like a mechanical clock) how it is made from natural materials retaining their structure partly and forced into certain shapes by an artisan. As we all know, the structure of the CPU die is so delicate, it can only be seen under a microscope. And of course, a CPU constitutes one extremely tightly joined, functional unit, a "unified material" object and cannot be disassembled and reassembled again like a mechanical clockwork. So, wouldn't it be consistent for Aristotle to regard such artifacts like a CPU as substances? 

Many people don't have a driver's license or a car and they still manage to live their life. Also, much driving is connected to definitely non-essential purposes like leisure. But even if we dismiss the driving argument, we can quickly construct another: In modern plant agriculture, there is no way to avoid killing vertebrates like mice, lizards, snakes, rabbits, etc., this is caused unintentionally by ploughing and harvesting and intentionally by vertebrate pest control. Since human survival depends on plant agriculture, we “can't” just stop doing it. But... this doesn't excuse that most vegans do not live by a principle of truly “maximal harm avoidance”. Let's say: 

We have subjective experiences (SEs), which often mirror the outside world. But metaphorically speaking, we also have an “inner eye”. For example, if I look at a black square table in a white room like this... 

would approach 0.5 for an infinite sequence. This is the case for the following very regular sequence 

… why should we assume that for a person X to come into being, a zygote with X's DNA existing first is a necessary condition? It can't be a sufficient condition, obviously – think of twins. Let's say that a person Y suffers from a genetic disorder, caused by a spontaneous mutation. How could we justify that it is metaphysically impossible for Y existing without the genetic disorder (a conclusion which would follow from Dawkins' view on the matter)? 

It depends what we mean by “understand the logic”. If A and B both think rationally and have access to the same evidence, yet come to different conclusions it must be because they value the strength of the evidence not in the same way or find certain types of inferences to be more reliable. Sure, the outline of B's reasoning can be understood by A – we can call this “understand the logic”. But A probably cannot fully comprehend why B judges some evidence or types of inference to be more or less persuasive than he does. Though much can be made transparent to A, I doubt that the complexity of B's different cognitive style and the influence of his background can be fully grasped by A. 

You see that most of the time these methods (especially powerful are 1., 4. and 5.) aren't available in metaphysics (and philosophy in general). That's why consensus in philosophy is so rare. 

Natural kinds are secondary substances for Aristotle and so a fundamental feature of reality. Yet these natural kinds are most importantly (and as far as I know, exclusively!) biological species. I think this is very strange on the face of it. To plagiarize from Jerry Fodor: 

I had some heated arguments with “emergentists”, who tend to define strong emergence as something like: 

And materialism does this. It answer this question very elegantly and convincingly (which does not mean correctly). The ultimate principle is objectively observable, purposeless ‘physical stuff’. The universe is inherently meaningless, there is no goal or point to it. It just exists. And by operations of chance and necessity everything else has come to be. While we may dislike this answer, it allays our thirst for further probing deep metaphysical questions. For example, “Why exists something rather than nothing?” – what's the point of asking that if what exists is just inherently meaningless? Or, “What is the meaning of life?” - either there is none or the meaning we personally give it, it is not tied to the cosmos. Theism, of course, is also a world view which at least gives us the illusion to answer ‘The One Question’. But what about atheistic dualism (or atheistic non-materialism)? It fails to answer ‘The One Question’ satisfyingly. In substance dualism we must just take it as a brute fact that two fundamentally different substances exist. Now, why does ‘mind stuff’ exist? Why? Where does it come from? A materialistically conceived evolution surely can't explain it. How can we dare to believe ‘consciousness’ is equally deeply built into the universe as fundamental physical properties, like say, electrical charge or mass? Outside of a theistic context it really sounds like the universe from *cough* not that intellectually challenging science fiction. Like Star Wars... or Warhammer 40.000. Why does such an extremely weird universe exist? This is beyond “quantum mechanics” weirdness, it is unacceptable weirdness. “Why is there something rather than nothing?” definitely becomes a pressing answer again. Also “What is the meaning of life?”: there is no transcendent God – but there seems to be a profound connection between human life and the natural order, since consciousness is a fundamental part of the fabric of the universe. Maybe there is a cosmic meaning? But on the other hand, we are not living in a universe that is very nice to its creatures. Even if we live in the best circumstances, there still is death and suffering all around us, psychologically healthy humans are just able to ignore it. As Goethe's Werther puts it: 

There's no rhyme or reason in the GPL and its supporting rhetorics, it's about what Richard Stallman likes and feels, and that's it. I like copyleft, and have a lot of respect for Stallman, but it seems he can't think that rationally when he's not doing programming. The GPL is so ill-thought-out that it resulted in the bizarre situation of the FSF supporting the weaker interpretation of their own license in the Oracle vs. Google legal case! Now you're completely right, the “free as in speech” metaphor is completely illogical. There's probably not much to add to Drew Crawford's explanation: 

“Religious pluralism” here means believing that the teachings of the different religions are just variations of some “universal truth”… like John Hick did, for example. Surely religious pluralists want to exclude Jim Jones, the Order of the Solar Temple, Aum Shinrikyo, the Branch Davidians, Heaven's Gate, etc., from this? Maybe it's the violence and destruction which are the marks here… but religions exist, which do not stand out as violent or destructive, yet are extremely “off” compared to the mainstream denominations: Wicca, Setianism, Gnosticism, Sōtō-Zen, etc.. AFAIK Sōtō-Zen doesn't make any metaphysical assertions – how can a teaching that amounts to nothing be a variation of an universal truth? Or, how can believing in an evil creator god – as in certain variants of Gnosticism – not fundamentally contradict with believing in a benevolent supernatural cause of the Universe (as in the Abrahamic religions and Hinduism)? That is, far more fundamentally contradict than Buddhism does, which is agnostic about the cause of the Universe? Or, how can striving for self-deification – as in Setianism – not open up an unbridgeable chasm to mainstream theistic religions? Since it seems that religious pluralists necessarily have to be exclusionary, too, how do they decide on the criteria for exclusion? Certainly it can't be just about popularity… 

As usual, substances means the fundamental entities of reality ("the basic things from which everything is constructed" as the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy puts it) in a certain philosophical system. Or from the shorter routledge encyclopedia of philosophy, article "Substance": 

Why is non-Euclidean geometry, as encountered in relativity theory, always used as the prime counterexample to rationalism – and regarded as pretty much decisive? The parallel postulate was controversial from the start and Euclid himself avoided invoking it whenever possible; so it seems far from being a victim of a psychological illusion, the insight of the early geometers into the structure of space was so reliable, that they got – except this one issue – everything right and even correctly singled out the “later refuted”1 axiom as “problematic”. Is the strong association of rationalism with Kant (who thought – or at least so it is claimed – that space for us could only be Euclidean) the reason behind this? 

There have been very good answers, but I want to add a few thoughts. By any sane definition (sorry, Hobbes) of the terms, theism is incompatible with materialism. But the reverse is not true, substance dualism and atheism are compatible. Atheistic dualism is even a common view in the world, because of Buddhists and Taoists. But if we look just at Westerners, we get a different picture. So we must ask ourselves: What (in the West – for now on) makes (substance) dualism and atheism seem so incompatible? Why do atheism and materialism seem to go hand in hand? Why are nearly all prominent atheists also materialists? And why do discussions about consciousness get so heated? Just look at the hundreds of angry comments to an article from atheist philosopher Thomas Nagel, a summary of his book which attacks materialism (he doesn't commit to substance dualism, though). Substance dualism as defined by you (the OP) doesn't guarantee even the one important thing, which would be persistence of the self after death. Superficially it would not change much, except our attitude to free will, perhaps. So, why again, do atheists take it so serious? IMHO humans seem to suffer from an intense obsession to construct a world view, which can give us a satisfying cosmology, i.e. which can give a good answer to ‘The One Question’, the question of “arche” (ἀρχή): 

He supports his first claim with his argument from queerness, trying to show that moral values would be “qualities or relations of a very strange sort, utterly different from anything else in the universe” 1 – and so with all likelihood do not exist. The second claim he supports, well, empirically: a “survey” of Western philosophers shows that they were predominantly and explicitly moral realists. Supposedly for ordinary people something similar holds: 

In the first physics lecture I ever visited, the professor shortly demonstrated the fallibility of our senses with a spinning disc optical illusion to justify the use of measurement devices. He didn't say a word about where these measurement devices “come from”. If we can't intuit certain propositions by reason alone (i.e. for a simple clock, that identical pendulums will behave in the same way – otherwise, how could a comparison ever be made to get to Galileo's result that the period of a pendulum is independent of the amplitude of its swing?), how can we construct measurement devices? How can we do it, if we assume that scientific observation presupposes that we have and can use measurement devices? Was there a philosopher who pointed to measurement devices as an argument for rationalism? And how could an empiricist explain that the construction of measurement devices is compatible with strict empiricism? 

1 sloppily phrased, of course. Also, afaik there is no way to directly show the non-Euclidean nature of space. It follows from an appeal to the simplicity of the theory, that non-Euclidean geometry is to be preferred and therefore correctly describes space. Which ironically seems a pretty “rationalist” line of argument, too. 

“metaphysically necessarily impossible” (like tiling an – Euclidean 2D – bathroom floor with regular pentagons), 

That's a really weak argument. There's nothing really absurd with having no objective value of ‘justice’. Even moral anti-realism in total isn't an obviously absurd position. Not even remotely. We may not like it, but it certainly is supported by some convincing arguments and even has intuitive appeal (for example, see Don Loeb's mock-analogy between moral realism and “gastronomic realism”). If materialism, by entailing irrealism of some value of ‘justice’, would cause social problems, that also in no way can be considered a reductio ad absurdum. As if any thesis becomes refuted, or even only less plausible, just because we humans have a problem of pragmatically dealing with it… The Achilles heel of materialism seems rather to be found in the problem of meaning (intentionality) which strikes at the heart of science itself – and science was the supposed motivation for materialism in the first place. To quote Alex Rosenberg in The Atheist's Guide to Reality: Enjoying Life Without Illusions: 

First, determinism is not the same as the assumption that free will does not exist. Nor does even one entail the other. There are hard indeterminists, who believe in indeterminism but not in free will and compatibilist, who believe in determinism and free will. I also understand "solved" in your question as "contradicted". Now, determinism is, in most cases, conceived as the idea that by fixed natural laws an earlier state of the universe, even as early as its beginning, determines any later state. A well-known illustration of this view is Laplace's demon, an enormous intellect, who can perfectly predict the future, not by supernatural means, but by knowing the speed and position of every atom in detail and calculating (like an unimaginable super computer) in advance how the universe will develop. Yet, we can understand determinism differently, namely that the future is fixed. The B-theory of time claims that the passage of time is an illusion: past and future moments are not less real than the present. While the B-theory does not entail that there are rules by which past states determine future states, nonetheless there still is no way any event would have been able to turn out differently than it is observed. If determinism is understood in this sense, it cannot be contradicted by metaphysical entities, which usually refute determinism, like a source of true randomness. Now, regarding to entities like souls: Of course if the soul exists and is free in the sense that its existence decisively establishes libertarian free will, it must refute determinism and nonexistence of free will by definition. There is no way around it by the most basic logic. But we may understand "free" just in the sense that the soul or consciousness is independent from physical laws, i.e. it is conceived dualistically with mental-physical causation. And indeed, if we think about it, such entities may not be sufficient to refute determinism. Because there may still be psychological laws, by which the soul/consciousness operates and which may be deterministic, too.
