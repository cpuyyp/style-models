Pre-1800 The end of the American Revolutionary War was finalized by the signing of the Treaty of Versailles in 1783. This divided up the land in the New World, setting the boundaries of the various nations therein: 

People Will Talk Even without any evidence at all, people will attribute positive (or negative) events to magic - even in a world where magic doesn't exist. A lot of positive events will undoubtedly cast suspicion. When something happens that is statistically unlikely, people are more likely to assume that the 'winner' was cheating. Hiding would mean not being associated with any suspicious events. Life in a Glass House Now, as long as everything always goes great, a witch would probably be safe. People wouldn't want to push their luck, so as long as everything was always good. Of course... it's almost impossible for everything to always go right. Sometimes, even magic can't cure a disease, or stop an accident, and when someone gets hurt, there will be no more safety net. It's probably already gone - that brewer may have kept his life, but he lost his livelihood. If the townsfolk are already talking, it's only a matter of time before the torches and pitchforks come out. So what now? To keep her abilities hidden, Rynn needs to become a con artist. She needs to practice the art of redirection, of covering her true intentions with something that looks plausible. The townsfolk have associated all those events with her because she was there. What Rynn needs to do is: 

Vehicles, in this case, range from air ships to powered roller skates; regardless of size, any city will have some sort of transportation, be it for citizens or products. 

Without the rules learned from birth, the newly-sighted have to come up with their own rules - starting with the brain figuring out how far apart their eyes actually are. Without that information, it can't combine the left and right images into a single, 3D image. Still, the brain is an amazing thing, and even the elderly could teach their eyes to see. 

Even at the dawn of civilization, there is always something that can show that time passes. Sometimes long, like the time it takes for a new baby to grow into an adult, or for an insect-like or snake-like creature to molt; sometimes short (in the grand scheme of things), like a long walk between caves, or "I just ate and am not hungry" to "I'm hungry now"; and sometimes very short, like the time it takes for a wave to hit the beach and retreat, or the time it takes for a pebble to fall to the ground, or simply saying a word or phrase (one hippo-analogue, two hippo-analogue...). That can give very coarse time values, or very short time values; you wouldn't be able to cook a roast by pebble-falls (start the roast, drop a pebble five thousand times, check if it's done), nor would you be able to use lifetimes. A long walk (five times around the cave system) may work, however. As time goes on and technology improves beyond the stone-age, people will see that sand or water takes some time to fall, and can make hour-glasses or water-clocks. Candles take time to burn, so a well-marked candle could easily (and fairly regularly) show the progression of hours. Even a lamp burning fat could have markings on the side to denote time: fill the lamp and light it, put the roast in once the fat has melted, take the roast out when the fat level drops four lines. Once time can be marked, inventions measuring (and using) time will spring up quickly. Knowing that Junior takes half a candle to walk to his friend's hut to borrow a cup of sugar, Mom won't believe junior when he makes an excuse for taking a full two candles to go and return. And farmers can plant on a schedule, once every full water-clock-cycle, to make sure food ripens evenly, and not all at once. Once time can be measured at all - and this will happen early on - your people will soon find ways of measuring time more and more accurately, and will eventually think digital watches are a pretty neat idea. 

The biggest problems with creating modern technology from scratch will always be materials. You may have the knowledge to build a computer, but even two hundred years ago, the materials you'd need to even make a simple diode wouldn't be available, let alone complex circuitry. The second biggest problem would be tools; the tools we use now are at least four iterations past hand tools. You'd need to hand-build one machine, which would be used to create another, more precise machine, which would be used to create yet another, even more precise machine, and then you would finally be able to reliably create a single tool we use today. Multiply that by the hundreds of tools needed to build a computer, or operate on a person, and you already have years of construction and design, regardless of the number of people you have. 

The primary reason for clothing in most civilizations began as protection from the elements; sun, wind, and rain. Even in a warm climate with good weather, there is an occasional cold night over overly hot day. What starts out as a giant leaf hung over your head to protect you from the sun may well turn into a hat or a poncho; what starts out as an animal skin to keep the cold away may turn into a cloak. When weather has been dealt with, there will still be dangers from the surroundings: dangerous (or annoying) animals and insects, thorns or nettles, rough rocks, and so on. It doesn't take long to realize that a tough animal skin protects you from scratches (or even weapons), and soon that animal pelt becomes a tough leather vest, capable of protecting from slashing claws or knives. Once simple survival is no longer a looming threat, clothing can evolve into more than simple protection, into comfort. A leather vest may turn a knife, but a leather vest over cloth will let your skin breathe better. Clothing that is harder to make, or materials that are harder to come by will naturally be given status; as a civilization moves from clans and chiefs to cities and kings, status will play a natural part in clothing. A "country bumpkin" may still wear leather vests, but in the cultured city, where they don't need to worry about stray thorns tearing their clothing, they wear silk and dyed cotton. Not all civilizations had the full evolution of clothing from basic protection to the "stylish" clothing of today; many cultures never moved beyond the first step. There are tribes around the world that still wear little more than a belt. On the other hand, there are cultures that thrive on clothing of all sorts, the more impractical the better - look at the ridiculous wigs, dresses, and powdered faces of men and women of the French court in the late 1700's! The clothing choice of a given civilization should depend on their roots, the climate, and their lifestyle, along with the available materials. A jungle tribe would most likely wear little more than a necklace or a belt, because anything else would rot. A tribe in the far north would wear almost exclusively furs, to protect them from biting cold. An early European tribe would need protection from wind, rain, and sun alike, and they would have access to a wide choice of materials - wool, leather, furs, even silk - and thus would have a wide range of clothing styles. As time wears on and clothing evolves, the jungle tribe may not change much; the northern tribe would adopt warmer, layered clothing; the European tribe would continue to branch out, adding colors and simple designs, trying to make clothes that can stand up to both heat and chill. 

On a macro level, many animal species act like the made-up lemmings. Most of the time, predators and food supply keep the critters in check: 

A lot of answers are cautioning against using hydrogen or methane because of the explosive properties of those gasses - but in reality, there wouldn't be much danger. Those gasses are dangerous around humans, but that's because humans live in a terrifying danger zone. We use fire to prepare food, use lightning to power tools, and surround ourselves with objects and spaces that are seem designed to create dangerous static charge (wool socks and synthetic carpets in a dry house? Seriously?). Most creatures avoid all those things out of fear. Sure, lightning strikes might be a problem, but then again, it doesn't matter if you're filled with hydrogen or not, really. Apart from that, hydrogen is fairly safe, as long as it is contained. Producing hydrogen is possible, probably through "fermentative hydrogen production" to make biohydrogen, or biologically produced hydrogen. I think it's entirely possible for a flying creature to use hydrogen to maintain flight. Just... don't light a match if one is descending. 

Of course, the aliens may have overestimated the size of their snake. This snake-monster is huge. It's big enough to level most cities by sliding straight through, and its skin is tough enough to withstand anything but a direct nuke - even then, that would only make a hole, not destroy it utterly. Earth military wouldn't even bother to send tanks at it; as soon as it shows up and starts smashing stuff, they'll try to nuke it to a cinder. Not those little nukes, either; anti-missile guns will wipe out anything that comes near enough. They'll use the big ones, the well-that's-it-for-this-planet ones. It won't be pretty. We can only hope the parents catch on and stop it before it actually destroys the world... 

Time viewing The easy-to-build device allows anyone to view any point in the past "live" - that is, as if watching a video recording. Imagine the ability to look back on the ancient civilizations and discover if Stonehenge really was built by aliens! And then, someone discovers that they can use it to watch anyone, anywhere in the world, up to and including the present... and 100% of all privacy everywhere goes out the window. Now, that may not sound like Armageddon, but it would have a huge, drastic, and immediate impact on civilization as we know it. Imagine if an already trigger-happy government overhears another government talking about its destruction. Instant pre-retaliation! Nukes fly! And, the second they launch, everyone else knows about them too; thermonuclear war ensues, and the population is wiped out. If the device came from a culture with no sense of privacy, they would never even suspect that it could be an issue. Mind Transmission Like the internet, only for thoughts! Imagine the ability to speak to anyone in the world through nothing but shared thoughts. The military would snap it up immediately, as it would create an amazing instant communication for soldiers in the battlefield. Eventually, telecommunications would be replaced with braincalls; on the one side, users can think of a recipient, and speak directly into their mind. On the other, senders can "blanket send," and anyone who wants can join in and listen. And, just like the Internet, in a few years 90% of every message sent is spam. Unairconditioned rooms full of sub-minimum-wage employees sending think-a-grams to every person in the world. Productivity declines rapidly as people everywhere are overwhelmed by the massive amount of messages their poor brains are bombarded with; entire industries fall due to the inability of their workers to focus on their job. Imagine being an engineer in a nuclear power plant, but on the phone 24 hours a day, even being woken up at night, just to be asked if you want to buy printer cartridges. You are not going to do your job well; bye-bye power. And without power, there will be no food, no fresh water, no technology. Billions will die. That doesn't even consider those who just snap and kill themselves, or the others who snap and kill those around them... Of course, the hive-mind that designed it loves the concept, and are confused as to why no one else likes it. Everything You Could Ever Want The machine reads the mind of whoever is nearby, and presents them with the object they most desire, in its best form. Hungry? It gives a filling, yet healthy meal. Have to use the bathroom? It builds a luxurious lavatory fit for an emperor. Too many people who want to try it out? It builds a copy of itself all over the world, where anyone can access it. Of course, to power its creations, it uses the equivalent of five years of life. Whatever you wish for steals half a decade of your life away. Even without realizing it, humanity dooms themselves through greed. Their final, collective wish? "Life! I'm too young to die!" "Huh," the machine replies. "That's new. I don't know how to do that." The ancient civilization that built the machine was used to living for millions of years; as they aged, they realized it was better to experience life than to live nigh-on forever, and built the machine to create an Eden for anyone who did not wish to live forever. Oops. Wormhole Toasters Everyone loves toast. And everyone knows that the absolutely best toast is actually pulled from an alternate universe through tiny wormholes in the fabric of space-time. You didn't know that? It's true! Not many people have it figured out, but those "in the know" created the perfect toast-making machine. Using its own internal power source, each self-replicating toaster can produce up to one slice of toast per week! Warning: toast is actually summoned from an alternate universe. All goes well, until someone has the bright idea of creating not one piece a week, but three pieces for each meal. To do that, he would need 21 toasters. But what if he invited friends over? They would want toast, too. So he creates 50 toasters, just to be safe. In fact, everyone in the world manages to get their hands on a few of these. The food shortage is solved with the advent of 100 billion toasters (some people really like toast). Every week on the dot, each toaster pops out a single slice of toast, weighing exactly 50 grams. 100,000,000,000 slices of toast every week, or 5.2 * 10^12 pieces a year. On average, the planet gains about 40,000,000 kg a year due to dust. However, it now gains over 260,000,000,000 kg in a single a year! Worse, the sheer number of toasters - also built from wormhole material - begin making a rather nasty whining noise. As it turns out, all those wormholes together make one fantastically huge wormhole, destroying the entire earth. The aliens who created the technology are flabbergasted. I mean, toast is great and all, but come on! It's just toast! Who likes toast THAT much? They never even considered the fact that anyone would want more than a slice or two a month. 

With that in mind, I expect a snake-person as you described to usually move along solid ground with a serpentine motion, sidewinding on unstable or slippery ground, using the caterpillar movement to stalk prey, and finally using concertina to climb or traverse difficult/unstable ground.
