tell me a little bit about your self describe what makes you, you in a nut shell what do you know about us? why do you want to work here? 

At a job fair I was talking to a recruiting agent and he asked what I am getting my degree in. I said computer science with a specialization in networking and communications. He asked what made me go into that specialization. The reason is I was already in the computer science program and had taken some networking courses and done well in them and found them enjoyable. I basically already had taken 90% of the courses required for the specialization so in a sense it happened organically. What would be a good answer? It seems like the general answer to such a question would be "because I enjoy it and am good at it" but this wouldn't win many points. 

was a bit tricky but I managed to talk about how the company has a good reputation and I noticed on the job description they use current technology that I find interesting. 

I started a new job and my manager emailed me several documents, probably about 100 pages in total. They explain the concept behind the program I am a dev for. The first page of the first document I have almost no clue what it's saying, and it doesn't get better from there. Here is the first portion of the first page of the first document. I changed some information to maintain privacy and confidentiality. XYZ is the project name, ABC was an acronym I had no clue what it stood for. 

In a job application with the government they asked to e-mail them references but didn't specify what type (e.g. character or workplace). I was wondering what type of references are good to have? I normally keep on hand a few character references (organizers at volunteer work I do) and my manager of past jobs. How many references of each type should I give? How long is a reference valid for? For example I still have the contact information of jobs I worked at 8 years ago, and I doubt a manager who I didn't work closely with in the first place would be able to verify or deny a claim I made (for example would a manager really remember who setup the RAID on a particular computer 8 years ago?). What kind of questions are asked when a prospective employer contacts a reference? How should a reference be asked/reminded/notified that you have/would like to use them as a reference? Also when giving references, any tips on the format and information to include on them? I started including a link to their linked in profile so it can be verified they work where I claim they do. Out of curiosity why do some companies care more about references than others do? I've had some that don't check at all. 

Obviously it's difficult to be certain you would actually want to work at the company from just one phone interview and their public website. I could have answered this question better if I had the opportunity to ask her questions about the company first. The interviewer new I would be moving cities and I mentioned I was originally from the one where the job was. She said "so you would be staying with your parents?" and wanted to know about that. This touched a nerve and made me upset for the rest of the interview. Should I have said something? I seriously doubt she wants to hear why I can't live with my parents. 

Many of the jobs I'm applying for ask for the college transcript. I've gotten some low marks and now the school has started including the class average in the transcripts. Is there anything I can do about this? Generally my marks are lower than the average. I think the reason is I spend a lot of time doing athletics (e.g. triathlon training) but that's not something employers are interested about for tech jobs. Obviously I can't change the transcript but should I say something in the cover letter? Actually I'm in the co-op program and have quite a bit of (short term) work experience. 

My thoughts on what to do: 1) if I do go in, have a specific time that I will leave after no matter what. For example if I decide to go in for 8 hours, I would make a backup of everything, then after 8 hours I would be done even if the program is in a worse state than when I started. 2) I would like to speak to my manager's manager as I can communicate better with him. I am going to give the ultimatum that I'm only going to come in when my manager isn't there, as he tends to micromanage which results in breaking things. I know when he gets stressed he comes by every 20 minutes to ask how I'm doing and poke around and this seriously derails me. How can I state this diplomatically? Any other requirements I should ask for? I'm also concerned that when I come back the IT department will have shut off access to my account. FWIW I'm sure I could fix the problem with the program in a calm environment given 1 or 2 hours. UPDATE: I called my manager's manager (my manager is on vacation now) and he said it was his preference that I write some documentation as to the changes and how to fix it. With regards to the contract, it clearly said which days I started on, how many hours a week are worked, and how many dollars and hour I get paid. Nothing about the product or deliverables. With regards to the version control: I was told not to use it, though I had been making incremental backups. I did revert to a backup but my manager said it was too old. Yes I realize I should've made another backup of the finalized product, but I was in the process of handing everything off to my manager and was "caught of guard" when all of a sudden he had me change the source code. final update: I went back in. Fixed it. Now they want me to come back in again saying it's not running/they don't know how to run it. I'm not going back in again. 

My thought process: I wasn't actually sure of the position of the person I was speaking to and I asked if this was more of an HR interview than a technical one (since the position was operations engineer) and she said yes. With this in mind I had trouble answering 1 and 2. I wanted to talk about my skills relevant to the job position, but didn't think that would turn out well as she being in HR doesn't actually know the details. So what do they want to hear when they say "tell me about yourself"...I'm assuming it's not my favourite restaurants. Also 2 seems the same as 1. With 3 I felt like I was reciting off the information I had red on wikipedia. "The company was founded in 2008", "it has 600 employees". What else should I have said? 

I just finished a 5 month contract where I was hired as a program to make a program. The program is part of a bigger project. On my last day just as I was handing over everything, my boss had me show him some output from the program. He is not really technical (at least when it comes to programming) and he almost never checked my work. He noticed some omissions/bugs in the output and had me change the code. Of course it broke the program. Of course I couldn't get it back to a usable state. I did have a backup but my boss said it was too old. I do feel bad about not having made a more recent backup. Now my boss wants me to come in another day to finish it off. I wouldn't be paid for this and this is more of a favor. Summary: 

I know most people like to work in quiet environments and employers may boast about how quiet their work environment is. I'm not like that and I actually prefer some noise, I mean not random noise (e.g. construction work, traffic) but the sound of people working. I'm not sure how to best phrase this in an interview because I don't want it to sound like "I enjoy horsing around with my colleagues". Any suggestions? I thought I could state it as "I enjoy an open communication environment and work well with teams". I was at an interview today. In the interview we talked about how the workplace had a very team oriented atmosphere and people would collaborate all the time. As I exited the interview room and turned the corner (note the door to the room was never even closed) I was startled when I saw 4 or 5 people working around the corner. They were so quiet I didn't even notice they were there (they were women too, and I would've guest if anything women are more talkative than men). I felt a very strong incongruencey from what the interviewer just said about "working as a team" and "strong communication" and seeing these people so quiet (not even hearing the click on their keyboards) I must have not expressed myself well in the interview. I've worked in call centres and that kind of work environment is more comfortable to me. As an aside, it goes the same for roommates (you don't talk at work, you don't talk at home, where do you talk?) 

When applying for jobs I have 2 PDFs: a cover letter and a resume. I try to make them self contained as there usually isn't places for additional information. When the application procedure is to e-mail them, what should be put in the body of the e-mail? I try to keep it as short as possible because all the information is already in the cover letter/resume. On the other hand I don't want to sound rude or look like I'm not putting effort into an area. What I normally have is 

My boss is from Russia and has a thick accent, but as he's told me he's lived in the US for a long time and considers it where he's from. However there may be a language/cultural barrier. On a couple occasions my boss has said very strange things that I'm not fully comfortable with. For example "as a man you want to do work as your a provider for your family, but on the other hand as a man you need to take breaks so you can work well". That comment was out of the blue. I work in a room by myself and he came in and asked if I felt lonely, and I said not necessarily and he told me the previous person who worked in the room felt lonely by himself. After some thought, I did think it would be better if I worked in a room with some other people as I'm starting a new job and have much to learn. I went back to my manager to ask about working in a room with someone else and he asked if I had a girl friend and what my age was. This is where I get quite uncomfortable. He asked me if I'm looking forward to getting married and if I would like to establish my self first. I first half-chuckled at this and he replied "do you want to focus on your career?" What would be a good response?
