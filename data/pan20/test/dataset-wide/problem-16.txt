If it's stupid but works, it isn't stupid. Professional are predictable, the world is filled with dangerous amateurs. 

"It takes a thief to catch a thief." I don't know who coined it, but the saying seems generally accepted as true, and highlights a commonly perceived obstacle in law enforcement, that a law abiding officer -- which, I must assume, is one reason to have a robot police force, so ideally human sin and error are minimized -- however skilled, simply does have a criminal mindset. Professional criminals perceive the entire world differently, so adaption will likely be in unexpected, criminally brilliant ways. However, there are also criminals who inadvertently outwit the law, and by unconscious heuristics subvert the system, and not by being very intelligent, but intuitively or by plain luck. For example, if robot/people cops only use the newest and best technology, and the fortunate criminal keeps using his or her legacy system for communication, either by chance or some belief that it's 'lucky,' such a criminal would be very difficult to catch, especially in an advanced society. So long as no major blunders were made at least. Another way of saying this is, what if it never occurs to cops in a future society to read snail mail? I think two things from Murphy's Law of Combat are parallel to the criminal mindset which cause untold trouble to law enforcement, which make criminals difficult to handle, regardless of technology: 

A crash landing would cause irreparable damage to the ship. Additionally, some people might actually want to leave the ship and seek a new life. (This is the purpose of returning to earth anyway.) With out some logistics and trade, maintaining advanced tech could become incredibly difficult and impractical. As far as other aspects, rather than post an extended answer, I think I will simply that that just because humans lack iPads doesn't mean they can't survive brilliantly. Being human also entails a knack for surviving and adapting. Now those links contain stories where humans live on despite a scarcity of natural resources, although with great suffering. But if a ship crash landed in a fertile area, humans would have a distinct advantage over local fauna, who would be adjusted yet because their natural predator or prey instincts wouldn't yet be adapted to a human presence after such an extended absence. Meaning that human wouldn't be looked at as prey by predators, nor as predators by prey. A hunter-gatherer society would do quite well for itself so long as it ranged far to avoid depleting nearby resources. Humanity could in fact thrive. 

Plenty of species already evolve with us in urban environments (at least 'evolve' in the sense that they thrive and benefit from the urban environment). 

For starters, 'on par'--in the real world--is a misleading concept when comparing the societies. The America's had elaborate advanced societies as well. They were just different. The other big thing to note is that 1600's Europe was a society that formed from a long history of interacting with many other very diverse societies. So had Europe been left to their own devices, they never would have achieved the 1600's Europe that came to be. As such, hypothetically, it's doubtful that more isolated societies would advance the same way as societies with a lot of interaction with other societies. Even if both societies had access to the same types of diverse other societies, advancements would likely not mirror each other due to pure randomness. The reason we have different cultures is because of that. 

Species that are adept at changing environments and opportunistic in terms of leveraging human environments will thrive. Others will not. While not urban-centric, the PBS documentary on Dogs talks about one particular species that has thrived with humans: $URL$ 

Make it controlled. Nuclear reactors are controlled nuclear reactions. They're controlled to the point where there is no explosion. A nuclear bomb is an uncontrolled nuclear reaction. I'm likely stretching physics here, but one could perhaps have an incredibly tiny amount of fissionable material and then control it with a really tiny reactor (nano-sized rods?) 

Neither option is 'better'. But evolution, in general, is extremely slow. As such, we've mainly used technology to better adapt to this world. This has been fairly true since the beginning and is perhaps one of the defining aspects that makes us human. In fact, when technology enables us to do things, it eliminates the need to evolve to to do it directly. We figured out how planes work, so no need for us to evolve wings any time soon, for example. 

One thing the other answers miss is: pride. Building large, tall skyscrapers is very much about bragging. The pyramids weren't built for practical purposes. They were built as status symbols...as are most of the worlds 'tallest' buildings. Tall buildings are used as personal symbols (Rockefeller center), business symbols (Transamerica Building--later a symbol used by the city), and City symbols (1 World Trade Center). 

I'd look at all sorts of coastal islands. Sea stacks, for example. There are plenty of naturally occurring islands out there that are inaccessible by boat. Typically due to: cliffs, reefs, and the sea itself (rough seas). Cliffs make it impractical to build infrastructure for shipping, but you are correct in that people could always build trails. So I don't think it's the cliff that are necessarily the key element. Just one of the barriers. The bigger barriers would be shallow sands (possibly fixed via dredging), rocks and reefs (possibly fixed via demolition), rough seas (possible fixed by building sea walls). All surmountable, of course, but typically highly impractical. If you look at the west coast of North America, you'll find a lot of of the coast is not easily accessible by large ships. Most ports are in fact inland (up river or within large bays). 

I am currently reading an eternal golden braid, i've gotten as far as several lengthy chapters about the brain. He talks about neurons and symbols, what 'meaning' is and there is a lot of hypotizing going on. To me much seem like assumptions about our mind from a mind strongly affected by its knowledge about computers. Anyway it intrigues me! I got the impression that the brain is somewhat well understood on the micro level (neuron-level, not neutron level) but that it all falls apart when trying to understand it on higher levels. (this book was ofcourse written decades ago) Given current electroengineering technology and sub-infinite resources how slow/big would our model of the neural net of the brain become? The neurons in the model should reflect our current biological understanding of them. size/speed is all free variables in this question. I reckon doing anything close to 86billion braincells got to be too slow/memory intensive for doing in software in general unspecialized supercomputers. By speed i mean how long a 'thought' would take compared to a human if somehow the net was constructed and jumpstarted and it actually became an 'I'. How feasible would it be for a near future megacorp to afford to try making one? 

Who are the Qu? When a person dies unobserved they give rise to a being called a Qu. This has happened since the beginning of time. They have caused many of the myths of ghosts and gods throughout the ages. A Qu is just like a regular person except that they cannot occupy the same physical space that is 'seen' by a human(or any creature with a human soul). A Qu obeys all normal physical rules and has all the needs of a normal human, they need to eat, sleep, prefer to socialize and procreate. The Qu shares all the memories of the human it spawned from, similarities in personality may or may not be coincidental. If a body/hand/atom of a Qu is caught in a direct sightline of a human it is repulsed by the speed of light until distance/lightdispersion renders it utterly invisible to the viewer. Example: If a Qu is standing in a room and a human walks in and looks around, the human sees nothing unusual and the Qu is crushed into the wall instantly. The energy from the impact obliterates the very atoms of the Qu in an instant and the energy from the impact is dispersed evenly throughout the entire multiverse. The 'vision' of the human is a very physical object in the Qu plane of existence. If a human stood still and watched continuously a Qu would see the human's vision field as a blur and could approach, touch it and climb it. The Qu population on earth is unknown, but presumed 'small'. In human cities Qus are almost non-existent and their lives tends to come to abrupt tragic ends. Due to their nature Qu's are drawn to the wilderness where there are few humans around. Entire villages of Qus can be wiped out by a single hiker if they are not careful, so they are, very careful that is. Only direct observation causes a Qu to be repulsed. A human looking at a digital camera feed does not affect a Qu, the Qu can be perfectly observed. Lenses, glass or reflection does not offer a Qu any protection. The technology in modern times have had both positive and negative impacts on the Qu communities. It is matter of time before concrete evidence rallies the humans to serious investigation, this far they are undetected by the scientific community. Questions: How would the organized Qu communities handle the emerging situation? And how would they go about achieving their goals? [Variables such as 'how clothing works' can be defined if need be] 

Russia might be an interesting real-world example to look at. Many cities in Russia are incredibly remote, yet have transportation to them and infrastructure within. This is usually to accommodate industry (that is perhaps near water, or purposefully isolated) or access to remote natural resources. Modern day Canada would also be an example in regards to natural resources. The Alberta Tar Sands and the Northern Territory Diamond mines being good examples. Perhaps other economic and non-economic motivations could include: 

I think you can buy your way towards preparing for the apocalypse. But like you say, once it comes, money isn't worth much. So the entire 'buying' part has to happen pre-apocalypse. Once it happens, money will likely be less useful than brute strength...weapons, bunkers, etc. That said, there would likely still be valuable commodities (such as fuel ala Mad Max). So perhaps part of the preparation is to transfer one's monetary wealth into commodity wealth for post apocalyptic trade economies. 

The more muscle, the more calories needed. However, that doesn't necessarily mean more food needed. Just higher calories. But yes, food could be one problem. We may also see issues with the physical world having to become upgraded. Plane seats. Car interiors. Mattresses. Granted, we have to accommodate some of that today in some regions (namely the US) due to higher fat mass. So in terms of size issues, there may be a parallel there. And then things such as ladders. Instead of being rated for 200lbs, maybe they'd have to be rated for 300lbs. So there could be a need to increase natural resources to accommodate this more massive human. 

As several have pointed out, many animals were bullet "proof" at one point in history, only to be trumped by technological advances in firearms that render what protection they had useless against the increasingly improving technology. So, in the context of the real world, I believe the answer is no, as biological evolution is simply slower than human invention. Going back to even cavemen era, humans were able to hunt animals much larger than themselves quite successfully. One could argue that if it were possible, animals such as Elephants or American Bison would have already figured it out. :) However, there's one major exception to the above logic that I can think of: bacteria. Granted, we're not talking about bullets here, as fighting bacteria with bullets is rather impractical. But if we consider the invention of anti-biotics as a medical "magic bullet" the above argument changes, as bacteria has been able to evolve faster than our technology. We humans are in a constant battle trying to fight bacteria as they, quite literally, do evolve anti-biotic resistances faster than we can wipe them out.
