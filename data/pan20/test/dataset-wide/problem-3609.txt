Thanks in advance guys, really appreciate it! and for all you goal-chasers out there. My main goal would probably be to just drop body fat, lean out, stay lean for the summer, and then get back in the gym or get a power rack and more weights this winter. 

I like this program style. I think your volume and selection is right on. I think your ab routine is fine as well. You will have fun doing this as long as you utlize a progressive loading sequence. Your shoulders are getting worked in the following: Bench, Pec Deck, Tricep extension, incline curls, deadlift, planks... 

Can someone explain to me cumulative benefits of the following: Friend and I went for a Saturday walk at a park. We each had a kettle bells and they weighed 35lbs and 55lbs respectively. The track was 1 mile. The workout was as follows: Kettle Bell A - 35lb Kettle Bell B - 55lb Each person gets a Kettle Bell. Walking at the same time. We went 

Bigger and Stronger are not necessarily synonymous, you may want to get bigger looking, but you might not get stronger, and vice versa. I think the term you're attempting to describe is like progressive overload. I think what you're doing now is somewhat futile in that, you need to build your muscles, and condition them to handle more weight, more reps, etc. The weight increase should be steady and progressive. You may want to try and use those 25 lb dumbbells for some higher rep pyramid sets, doing things like 5 sets 20-15-12-10 and for example supersetting standing bicep curls with tricep extensions with little to no rest will create an environment for muscular hypertrophy. and muscular endurance. Both of which will help you when you want to increase the weight. If your interest is in Body Building or getting bigger, you will want to keep the moderate-high reps (9-12) with a somewhat heavy weight. If your interest is increasing your strength//oppose to getting bigger, you will want to increase the weight to roughly 80%+ max load, and do low reps (6 or less), pushing your central nervous system into extreme acts of strength, oppose to high consistency patterned demands on your muscle. I would say both activate a high amounts of fast twitch muscle fibers, but the high weight/low rep will activate more... I would also not leave until you did 4 sets of at least 2 compound exercises, and then add some isolation movements to a particular muscle group for that given day of the week, whatever you want to focus on. This will create your split. If pushups are your only chest exercise, you should be doing them to failure every time and constantly increase your reps per set, even if you have to collapse in between cranking them out, same for pullups... I was planning on sticking to the same weight each day until it became "easy", and then increasing it and repeating that process. Is this approach somehow flawed? It's not flawed, it's just not that convenient for a progressive system, usually you want to increase the weight or the reps in order to push yourself, sometimes it's easier to do 10 reps of 200lbs oppose to 20 reps of 100lbs. It's also about time under tension which you should google. So if you can't do a bunch of push ups, you can do them slower, creating more resistance. Are there any significant changes I should make to my program? What kind of results should I expect to see? As it stands you are missing a vital part of your strength training, and that's your legs. Working out your legs will boost metabolism and burn more calories at the gym due to the size of the quads and hamstrings, glutes and more importantly the core. I would research a lot about proper form on two main compound lifts, the deadlift, and the squat. Without those, you are just training your upper body, and you would really be cutting yourself short. Also, implement progressive overload system into each routine. You could expect to see fat loss within a week honestly, depending how strict your diet is, and how much you push yourself. Your body fat between 12-16% is probably ideal, so you're going to have to change it up eventually, probably have an active rest day with some HIT. Hope this helps some. 

I wrote a beginners guide to calisthenics on my site a couple of months ago. (Edit to add the workout) The basic format is 5 sets x 5 reps of the following exercises: Incline Push-ups Inverted Rows Bodyweight Squats Lying Leg Raises Short Bridges However if you can do chin-ups you're possibly a bit ahead of this. I do recommend you train for bridges though, they'll work your legs in a way that shouldn't put too much pressure on your knees. As for rest periods, that depends on your goals and training plan. If you're training for strength over muscle, then keep your reps low and your sets high. This will allow you to train more often. If you're training for muscle mass then make sure you have good rest periods to let your muscles recover. You should also train higher reps, 10-15 is a good amount, with only 2-3 sets. Either way, unless you're looking to build stamina, I wouldn't go over 20 reps. Once you can do this amount then perform a harder exercise instead. 

I teach my students using a mixture of wall pistol squats and partner assisted pistol squats. With wall pistols, simply squat down onto a low object such as a wall, once you can do 5x5, go a little lower. Partner assisted you simply hold your partners hand, and then use them to assist pulling yourself up, try to use as little assistance as you require. On top of that, make sure you're keeping good form. Your knee should track along the line of your toes and not fall inwards and your body should remain upright, not leaning to one side. 

The best bodyweight book I've read is Convict Conditioning by Paul Wade, this is the book that got me into calisthenics in the first place. I can also recommend all of Al Kavadlo's books as well as the Naked Warrior by Pavel Tsatsouline. The PCC blog has some excellent tutorials. Check out my own website Maximum Potential Calisthenics which features a number of tutorials including a beginners guide. 

To strengthen your grip for pull-ups, I'd keep it simple. Hang from a bar for as long as you can or a minute, whichever comes first. Repeat for up to 4 sets. This will improve your pull-ups no end. As for your wrist, take it easy and if it gets worse go see a specialist. I've trained a number of people who have had wrist pain when they first start calisthenics, make sure you do some wrist circles before you start to warm-up. Usually it clears up after a few weeks once they start to adapt to the exercises, but as I say if not then drop it back and go see a specialist. For more help on getting your first pull-up, check out my tutorial 

Sounds like you're ready to start muscle-up training, your numbers are decent enough (5 sets of 5 is my target before I move my students to muscle-up training). Add in some jumping muscle-ups to your workout routine. You're going to need a false grip on the bar, which means putting your thumbs and palm on the bar, rather than your fingers. This allows you to transition easier. For the jumping muscle-ups, start off in front of the bar. This is really important, as in a muscle-up you pull backwards, rather than upwards like a pull-up. So set yourself in front of the bar, with your hands in a false grip. Then explosively jump backwards and up. Kick your knees up and bring your arms down as fast as you can. Once your chest is past the bar, do the fastest sit-up you can imagine and you'll be over the bar. Combine this will kipping pull-ups and keep practising. EDIT: Here is a video tutorial I posted on how to do a jumping muscle-up $URL$ 

Dumbbell Rows and Deadlifts have helped me while shoveling. Also a strong core is going to be huge in the overall movement. Try Cable Choppers for core development, single arm rows, or conventional deadlifts. You could also push a sled with 45 lb plates on it. I forget what they are called, but that should give you that positional form similar to shoveling and the calf/quad strength to PUSH THAT SNOW -Midwest Winter Bearer :) 

I assume you are referring to the six-pack? In which case they already exist as your abdominal muscles, its up to your diet and your exercise to accentuate them. You must also consider your diet + exercise because as the old saying goes "abs are made in the kitchen", meaning you must get to a very low body fat % in order to see the striations along the "packs"...means you have to get lean. Also consider that different ab exercises will accentuate them in different ways. For example, weighted crunches are going to give you bulky looking protruding ab packs, where-as high volume high reps or endurance ab work will trace your ab's against the skin that covers them, instead of (looking like) pushing out of them, if that makes sense. 

CT Fletcher will make your workout more interesting... CT Fletcher has a great story behind his going from cardiac arrest into world record holding weightlifter. Here is his channel, and a nice play list CTFletcher Mike Rashad - does work outs that are INSANE and motivating. 200RepBench Really it's a matter of pushing yourself. Or finding the motivation...do you work out better with a partner? Perhaps a personal trainer can motivate you (I highly suggest interviewing first)? Another thing, Goal Setting. If you set goals, and you can achieve them, at the end of the "boring" training session, you will feel the satisfaction of achieving that goal. Make the mind/muscle connection. That is important. The natural high you speak of, comes from a mixture of mind/muscle connection + the desire to achieve + your own inner voice telling you to push. Get off the exercise bike? What the hell is that supposed to do? You sit there and pedal so you can watch TV? Get off the elliptical. Those are not fun exercises. Go pick up some free weights, and give yourself a 4 week 8 week and 12 week goal, whether that goal is to become stronger, leaner, lose fat, complete 50 pushups, curl some weight, or a combo goal, it should be the motivating factor while yo're in the gym. BTW where are you working out? Home? Gym? What equipment do you have available? 

Sounds like you need to work out your Brax and possibly lighten the weight. In my experience when doing barbell curls/concentration curls I would get an intense sharp pain from my brax to my elbow (yours may be to wrist). This is because I transitioned too soon into heavier weights thinking it would help define my biceps oppose to higher volume lighter weights which really would define my biceps. My sister is a personal trainer and advised I incorporate some hammer curls into my routine. I did an alternating hammer curl style, just 4 sets of 20 with a lighter weight, maybe 25lb DBs...really works your bi's and forearms increasing your muscular endurance and strength overall. I would firstly do that (incorporate hammer curls into routine), then take the same weight in hammer curls and start there with your barbell curls, or as close as possible maybe a little heavier, see if the soreness goes away, should improve after a week or two of hammer curls. 

No it won't cement itself. Mobility is very much a "use it or lose it" addition to your strength arsenal. As you say stretching is temporal. So is mobility. For overhead stuff say you do shoulder dis-locators, for example, then when you're done working out, say 3 days later, you haven't done any more mobility stuff. You will lose that mobility and need to warm up (mobility wise) to get back in the swing of things. Keep at it! However, the motion of the movement would cement itself. It's called muscle memory. This also supports the reasoning behind: When you take a break and get back into the same sport, you will get the strength gains back quicker than if you had never played before. This is because your body remembers the pattern of movements and can therefore apply them quicker.
