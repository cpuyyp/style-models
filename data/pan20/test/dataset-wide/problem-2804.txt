There's perhaps something of hint of a meta-joke lurking in this demand for the original author of "otherness". Very generally speaking, the idea of the other (sometimes called alterity) is: (a) phenomenologically disruptive of our self-assurance and authority to "legislate" our own words/writing (Derrida, Levinas), and (b) epistemologically confounding, through presenting us with fundamental un-knowability, at least as to the inner sense of the enjoyment/desire of the other (Lacan, Zizek, but Nietzsche belongs here too: what if nature/wisdom were a woman?) Hence altogether then we have a map of a kind of onto-epistemic humility -- and the traces here of so-called negative theology can be detected. Heidegger and Levinas are perhaps close to an originary dialectical couplet here of the modern conception of alterity and otherness, who between them articulate alterity in its horror and intimacy. It is Levinas who recaptures a transcendental sense of phenomenological alterity in the infinity of the face-to-face encounter and the subsequent demand of the other upon us, which at its most fundamental is simply to let the other live: the most basic sense of alterity in this sense is an ethical injunction not to murder. 

Watson's Guattari's Diagrammatic Thought addresses this directly, and in particular goes over the evolution of this concept in some detail (from p. 12): 

I'm now thinking this may be part of some commentary on Bergson's remark that "a philosopher worthy of the name has never said more than a single thing: and even then it is something he has tried to say, rather than actually said". 

Several organized or semi-organized groups of people in the world have really horrendous ideas, and react disproportionally strongly to any critique. I think most readers can agree with that statement, although we might disagree about which groups constitute examples of this. My set of such groups currently include militant Islamists like ISIS, the far right and far left political fringes in the West, the fanatically pro-Israeli (who tend to label any criticism as anti-Semitic), the fanatic Palestinians, and, yes, the typical modern day philosophers who, according to highly respected philosopher John Searle, make a living producing a lot of (quote) (1)“nonsense”. Now my general approach to such groups is to not accept or bow to their rules. 

can not entirely be understood this way, because of the word “hence”. I suspect that something’s been lost in translation here. 

In the above image the colors are an invention, not a discovery. Different people will maybe choose similar coloring here, but I think it's pretty much an artistic choice. The colors roughly reflect how fast a point in the complex plane will head off to infinity under a certain repeated square-and-add operation, but they depend on a lot of parameters (including how many iterations one deems sufficient to establish the wayward nature of a point), including, of course, some particular color palette. I think this illustrates nicely that the very same mathematical beast can have aspects that are discovered, and aspects that are invented. ;-) 

Analytic a posteriori claims are generally considered something of a paradox. First, let's recall that an analytic proposition's truth is entirely a function of its meaning -- "all widows were once married" is a simple example; certain claims about mathematical objects also fit here ("a pentagon has five sides.") So, an analytic proposition is 'inherent' in a way that isn't the case for a synthetic proposition. Consider Kant's own example of a synthetic proposition: "all bodies are heavy." The reason this isn't analytic is that the predicate ("heavy") isn't 'contained' in the subject ("body"), as it would be for the claim, e.g., that a square is four-sided. There is an inherent 'ease' with analytic claims, since all one needs to do to know it is "extract" the predicate from the subject. Now, the a priori/a posteriori distinction is about whether we know something from experience. This may seem similar but it is distinct from the analytic-synthetic question (which again is about whether the subject contains the predicate or not); note that many a priori claims are also synthetic. Perhaps the clearest examples of a priori claims are mathematical expressions (). Finally, let's consider the problematic hybrid you have asked after. A proposition that's analytic a posteriori would contain the predicate within the subject (as 'triangle' contains 'three sides') but would only be justifiable based on experience. Kant thought this category was paradoxical, as he thinks you never need to resort to experience to justify analytic claims. However, some modern critics like Stephen Palmquist have argued that in fact philosophy requires these aposterior analytic claims to function in its characteristic 'hypothetical' mode: 

Not quite arbitrary association 2: In pixel based graphics there is an operation that takes an area of one image, and an area of another, and applies an arbitrary bit-level combination specified as a truth table. It was a result of the Smalltalk project at Xerox Parc, where it was identified as one of the crucial elements required to implement a graphical user interface. At that time it was called “bitblt”, short for “bit block transfer”, and e.g. the Windows API has a function, plus a number of variations & extensions. 

There can be a zillion different unknown unknowns. E.g. suddenly a giant TV set might drop from the sky. One prepares by estimating probabilities for various kinds of unknowns, and concentrating the effort on the least unlikely. The dropping TV set is very unlikely, to the point that it would be counter-productive to waste time and resources on preparing for it. Unknowns of the kind "almost zero probability but almost infinite impact if occurs" are also best disregarded. Multiplying the near zero probability by the near infinite impact if occurs, to get an expected impact value, doesn't really work in this case. Very small differences in the numbers can produce very different expected values, so there's no real information about probability to be had. E.g. Blaise Pascal (contemporary of Descartes) used an expected impact value argument to apparently prove that one should better believe in a specific god. But it's in the nature of near-zero-probability things that there are zillions of in principle possible such things, so e.g. Pascal's argument failed when other possible gods were considered. For computer belief management dealing with unknowns involves representing both probability and support. For example, 50% chance of raining tomorrow with 100% support means that in half the cases, it will turn out to rain. But with 0% support it doesn't mean anything: no prediction is possible, and the probability must just be ignored. At least one theory that attempts to do this correctly, Dempster-Shafer evidence combination, suffers from combinatorial explosion, i.e. it's just impractical. Apparently one can not, in practice, get a completely correct picture of the world. Happily very rough approximations work well in practice. But that means that we in some cases will end up with doing the Wrong Thing, where if we but had infinite memory and processing capacity, would have enough info to do the Right Thing; hence the expression "20-20 hindsight". 

Watson also sheds some light on the relationship between schizoanalysis and cartography, and helps place it within a larger cultural-theoretical context: 

One direct way of stating the heart of the question might be: is there sufficient textual evidence and support for the assertion that Plato's Republic contains meritocratic elements? A second and larger concern here would be if so, because of this meritocracy, and not to mention the absence of slavery, the Republic could be considered in some sense democratic, at least perhaps moreso than the ostensible democracy of Greece, limited of course to land-owning males -- and perhaps in this context it might make sense to ask whether this "real" democratic element is present in our contemporary democracies. In a way this question comes down to the following one: does the Republic include a meritocratic analysis of the population at every stage of psychic development? A possible equivalent today might be global universal education, which every child could gain entry to -- although higher levels would involve passing increasingly rigorous tests. In other words, could the ostensible aristocratism betrayed by Plato's advocacy of the "noble lie" of the myth of the metals -- that certain people are gold, others silver, yet others bronze, etc. -- be read on the contrary as reflecting not a base classism (or worse a vulgar racism) but rather and perhaps counter-intuitively the very heart of the radically progressive or democratizing-meritocratic impulse that is the engine of the Republic? Is there in the Republic a global selection over the population for traits that could be optimally deployed in various roles or functions within the society? What about the very negative authoritarian dimension of the Republic, the expulsion of poets and artists; as well as the de jure caste system which would seem to strongly favor an aristocratic interpretation rather than a democratic one? I guess I want to graft the "democratic" onto a different chain of signification, and point to the inner radically democratic (because meritocratic) moment in the Republic where, at least from the perspective of a child, everything is possible: all possible paths are potentially open to everyone. What makes it "just" and "fair" is precisely this lack of socio-economic barriers to individual growth and development. I don't want to paper over the negative dimensions and palpable distaste for the "masses" that is present in Plato's text here; but does it seem at all justified to make this case for a possible democratic recuperation of the Republic? Apologies for the length here. Just to reiterate the basic question: is there textual evidence for meritocratic social advancement and organization in Plato's Republic? (And if so -- as a secondary concern, that is really the motivation for the first question -- is it then reasonable to further characterize this aspect or impulse of Plato's thought as effectively democratic in some ways; might it be reasonable to say this meritocracy relates to what it means to have democracy?) 

according to the Wikipedia quote above it was a mixed response. Some people, including Carl Hempel, “continued support of logicism”. Assuming that they didn't fail to understand the import of Gödel's work, one must conclude that these people did not see Carnap's “universal language” for reducing mathematics to logic, as essential to the logical positivism, whatever they then defined it as. 

1) I don't recall exactly those experiments, sorry; I only remember reading about it, but no doubt they involve exponentially increasing effects (i.e. chaos, in its mathematical meaning, more informally the butterfly effect) and inspecting ever more fine details. 2) I almost used the acronym SDS, Heinlein's Super Duper Snooper, with a footnote explaining it, but then I thought better of it. 3) Can't leave this without mentioning Charles Stross' “Accelerando” universe and “Glasshouse” novel. 

Well, the idea of a directly programmed intelligence, one where each main function of the mind was implemented by a programmer, was common in the 1970's. But while it's nice as a goal to gain better understanding of how e.g. vision processing works, it's wholly impractical as a way to create an intelligence. As already Alan Turing (1)noted in 1948 or so, the most likely way a machine intelligence is created, is the way that a human intelligence is created, namely by growing up and learning – with some basic instincts and abilities in place, of course. So a first answer is that the question as posed doesn't make much sense, because it's very unlikely that a machine intelligence will be of the directly programmed variety, that there will be any programming (except of basic functions such as edge detection in vision processing): I'd guesstimate that it's about as likely as a crocodile emerging up through the asphalt in the street, deftly stealing your wallet, only to be hit by a giant iron hippopotamus accidentally dropped from an airplane passing above. However, running on a digital platform means the possibility of making copies, partly or completely. It means the possibility of trying out things in simulated environments. Not the least it means that explorations of possibilities can be really, really fast. Currently the electronics is some millions times faster than our brain stuff, and that difference increases exponentially, which it's kept on doing since 1965 or so, roughly a doubling every 2 years. So we can expect some really fast evolution as soon as machine intelligences start creating new ones. 

Deleuze and Race looks like it explores some of the anti-racist elements of D+G's philosophy pretty thoroughly -- might be worth a look. 

I would think of Nietzsche here: the way melody and rhythm condition and mutate all of creation or expression. The musicality of speech would be a primary example here to my mind, but the point would be that even philosophies sing, whether celebratory hymns or pious dirges... So there is always beneath the explicit content a profound implicit sense -- I'm tempted to say spirit, but you could also say subtext. It's a question of who/what is speaking through you, the text, the world; singing through signs and phenomena. A question of different musics for different ways of feeling, thinking, living. 

Just in passing and much too long for a comment: Deleuze's thoughts on this may be aggressive -- but keep in mind that (as he says) the question "what is the use of philosophy?" itself is intended to be caustic or at least ironic. So the ideas below may not be expressed with your sensibilities in mind, but they are certainly not meant to insult anyone. He does say that philosophy makes stupidity something shameful, but again this is not exactly an insult to anyone -- given again that he emphasizes that philosophy is at its most positive as an enterprise of critique, dispelling the various myths that stupidity falls for. For background, here are the relevant remarks from Nietzsche and Philosophy (p. 106 of this edition): 

1) John Searle: “I don’t read much philosophy, it upsets me when I read the nonsense written by my contemporaries”, in an interview with New Philosopher Jan 25th 2014. 

In other news, … I find it noteworthy that the notion of practically irreducible complexity is not one of the "two positions" you list, namely (1) the supernatural and (2) the view that some things just can't be understood. If there ever was false dichotomy it must be this, with both branches just childish nonsense. Is it really true that modern adult philosophers in general think one has to choose between the childish nonsense options (1) and (2)? 

where is an identifier to be defined if it isn't already, denotes assignment (which creates an identifier if it doesn't exist), on the right hand side evaluates to logical if it doesn't yet exist, denotes logical OR, and denotes a new object, which is the result of the OR-expression if evaluates to . It's also the basis of boolean short-circuit evaluation in a great many programming languages. 

This is called disjunctive normal form, because it's a disjunction of individual conjunctions of the possible combinations of terms. You do not have to define each such table separately. 

You can find this discussed in introductory texts for digital electronics or low level programming. I remember reading my 3 year older sister's high school textbooks where logic was discussed. Then already when I entered high school, this was in Norway in 1978, most of the material on logic had been removed, although the notation, with e.g. ∧, ∨ and ¬ denoting respectively AND (conjunction), OR (disjunction) and NOT (negation), was still discussed. The truth table (a, b, c, d) denotes the function 

Some quick thoughts. It seems that Chomsky is worried about losing the critical universality that grounds political analysis; a condition, presumably, of any socialist revolution. But without examples it does seem to be somewhat bitter, decrying faddish-but-incoherent theorization as some kind of major "cause" of stalled third-world revolutions. There were certainly leftist insurgencies over the last half-century powered by "postmodern" thinkers -- the Italian movement Autonomia seems like a quite plausible candidate here, associated with Antonio Negri's "workerism" and being strongly influenced by various strands of post-Marxism and situationism, etc. There are certainly political dangers to "generalized relativism" and speculative detachment. But postmodernism is probably not best summed up this way; and may be better understood as a variegated family of experimental movements than as some holistic "unified field theory". It may help to keep in mind that movements like situationism conditioned not only new aesthetic and logical relations "in theory" but also new forms of life, new capabilities and opportunities for social transformation; and have been instrumental in raising mass consciousness about the bad economic determination of existence under capitalism. If you're worried about the decline of the left generally, or that postmodernism has left the universalism of "serious Marxism" in ruins: Lenin still walks around the world; and the strangest tongues still do understand him. (Consider maybe also here that postmodernism is also often a likely scapegoat for the right, existing today largely as an excuse to interrogate the "leftist" academy about its curriculum corrupting the youth...)
