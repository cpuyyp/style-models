One can always pass on the various techniques of situational awareness to others while in the outdoors by simply sharing your knowledge while hiking! In order to be good teachers, we must be versed enough in this art in order to pass on the knowledge we have learned. Some universities offer courses which include situational awareness within their particular course. An example would be 2014 Outdoor Council of Canada (OCC) Leadership course offered by UBC which contains the following in its course content: 

Personally, I think you should be okay with your boots. You will have to walk slowly, but you should do fine. It may be beneficial to walk around with a walking stick in spots and try to avoid the ice if you encounter it. I do not know what kind of snow you will encounter at Big White, but they do offer rentals at the Big White Ski Resort, if need be. Another tip I would suggest is that you follow the Daily Snow Report, just before leaving for Canada, so you can have information on the Big White Terrain & Ski Conditions. I would be more concerned about the temperature than the snow. I live near Vancouver and this year has been exceptionally cold for us and Kelowna is 271 km away from here by plane or 389 km by car. A curious side note: Australia Day is just around the corner! If you're Australian or not, come and celebrate everything that is great about 'Down Under' on January the 26th. Wear your best Australian gear and meet Boomer the Kangaroo at the top of Kangaroo run at 10am. More info here. 

As to why you're still cold with those specs: it happens to me as well, and I think the specs are for the 'average' person meaning not only average amount of body fat but also average temperature regulation (as in: certain people feel cold at x°C, while others might already feel cold at x + 2°C or so, you get the point). So it might be possible that you have e.g. low body fat and hence less insulation and also tend to feel cold quicker. So even though the bag's comfort temperature is at -2°C you still get cold because it's just not a sufficient amount of insulation, for you. I'm not 100% sure this is the case, but it seems a plausible enough explanation; the alternative being that the specs on your bag are simply incorrect and/or exaggerated. As to what to do about it: first time it happened to me I just put on 2 extra layers of clothing and that was warm enough though not extremely comfortable. After that I got another bag for lower temperatures (something like 5°C lower comfort temp. than the other one) and the was warm enough as well. Also make sure that whatever you put between your bag and the tent floor insulates enough, or sleep raised from the ground. 

This is specifically referring to cool, completely extinguished ash. Please be sure to properly put out your fires and allow all ash/coals to sit for an extend amount of time (several days if possible). 

You can actually boil water in any material that has a higher ignition point than 220 degree F (100 degree C) because the water will hold the temperature at its maximum boiling temperature. 

Are there any recommended methods for disposing of ash from fire pits while primitive camping? I have run into several fire pits in National and State forest camping areas where the fire pit or fire ring is already filled with ash to a point that seems excessive and unsafe. What are the recommended methods for clearing the pits to maintain a minimal impact? 

Toothbrush design and materials have come a long way. Early forms of the toothbrush have existed for nearly 5000 years. Ancient civilizations used a “chew stick,” a thin twig with a frayed end. The sticks were rubbed against the teeth to remove food. Source: American Dental Association Baking soda can be used in lieu of toothpaste and would cut down on water weight in the paste. Toothpaste has 5 components: abrasives, Fluoride, humecants, detergents, and flavoring. Baking soda provides the abrasives and detergents, and eliminates the flavoring and does not need the humecants which keep water in the paste (prevent it from crusting up). Source: Colgate Corp Dental floss (or a toothpick) versus a toothbrush might be a lighter option for mouth hygiene. It removes the major food particles and bacterial clusters between teeth, which in my experience are what causes the most irritation and gum issues. I think that these are negligible advantages to bringing a small toothbrush and some toothpaste, but if you really are looking for barebones try the stick, floss and baking soda alternatives. You can also try cutting the handle of the brush to cut down the length and weight. And stick with only the amount of toothpaste you will actually need on the trip, versus a whole tube. 

Looks very similar to a bird nesting facility I've seen before in nature reserves. Purpose: allow for safe nesting for (probably a specific, possible endangered, species of) birds. Safe, because it is not attached to the land so some predators won't be able to reach it. Not sure if there is an official name for it. Also I've seen similar looking devices which were rather meant for feeding but because this one already has dry grass which looks like it was put there by people I suspect it's meant for nesting. edit as Kate points out in the comments, these might very well be loon nesting platforms. Sources like this one shed extra light on the reason they are used. Not just for protection against predators but also against changes in water level (often human-induced) and simply because there might not be enough good nesting opportunities anymore (again, usually due to humans). 

This depends on the person of course, but yes, any type of extra exercise which is sufficiently long would be beneficial. And 20min of fingerboard might just do the trick. Especially with climbing where strength can become the limiting factor. However if it is really enough to get to e.g. 6C is something different. A fingerboard is mainly about forearm strength. Ok, biceps as well if you're doing pull-ups, but that is about it. And while forearm strength is important in climbing there's a ton of other muscles you'll be using as well: climbing really is a 'using the whole body' type of sport, especially when adavancing to the higher grades. So: the fingerboard won't hurt (though keep in mind to warm up gradually to avoid injuries) but to know whether it helps you'll have to try it since there's more to climbing than just fingers. Probably, unless you are a pro working on some specific body part, the single best exercise for climbing is simply more climbing. If I go from once a week to an average of 1.5 times per week, after a month or two I'm climbing 1 grade higher. I tried other things like fingerboards and never got any yield like that. What did help me a bit, but not as much as actual climbing in a dedicated spot, was mimicking climbing by having multiple fingerboards and whatever could serve as a grip and creating a small climbing route at home. You do need the space for that though. Climbing trees is another thing, though more dangerous. But it's also more fun, and hence easier to sustain, than the just seeminly pointless hanging from a fingerboard. 

It should be noted that most animals cannot see true spectrum green and blue can be used for tracking wounded animals. The following is from Voidhawk Flashlights: The best 3 color RGB Tactical Flashlight available today! 

How to throw a tomahawk? First of all get a traditional throwing tomahawk made for this purpose. Never try throwing an axe, a camping hatchet or a non-throwing tomahawk. 

Fishing in a river while wearing waders permits me to fish down stream and positioning my lures in the spot that is only possible while being in the water. This also helps me to avoid the many snags such as branches and tree trunks that are commonly found on the banks of many water ways. I can not tell you how many lures I have lost while fishing off the banks of rivers. If you fish from the bank of a river you must cast your line upstream. eventually your line will float downstream and make its way towards the edge of water. Hopefully in a spot one can retrieve your equipment for another cast. Fly fishing can only be done while in the water due to fact that one is moving the fly in in two directions, both in a forward and backward positions. It is the only way to avoid snags. Since most people do not wear waders while fishing or venture into the water I have many more options as to where I want to fish. There is nothing more challenging than fishing on a bank with too many anglers in areas that are renown to be good salmon spots. With waders on I am able to go upstream 100 meters or so from the group and get the big ones all by myself. The spot I prefer to fish in has trees and shrubs on both banks and making it impracticable to access my fishing hole from the banks. As a side note: Waders keep the leaches off! 

I looked over the website you provided. It appears that these permits are for large events. It reads like the park might have large picnic pavilions. I would guess that the permit and fee would be to reserve the entire pavilion for a large private gathering. Though this may be a simple solution, call the park office to confirm availability and fee info. 

You could always get a pour spout that you can use for any liquid. here's an example They sell them almost anywhere they sell kitchen utensils (even some hardware stores). Then you can use the coke bottle, the olive oil bottle, anything. An alternative, placing chopstick in the bottle so that it sticks out of the mouth where your pouring will create a surface that the oil will follow along better, having the pour extend a bit past the mouth and stopping it from running down the bottle. The more viscous the better this works. 

I have been to several locations where I have seen clearing similar to the one I am in currently? This was a clear cut logging area. There are what look like small trees that we cut down, though this was identified in the answer below as the branches removed from the trunks, and left behind. Location: Southern Pennsylvania - Fort Loudon. Photos are from August 16th, 2016 These are my personal photos and require no licensing. Feel free to use and share. 

When I was young, we would hunt both rabbits and grouse with a .177 caliber air rifle and found them fine for hunting. We made it a point of using pointed pellets while hunting: 

In a truly wild area, I believe such an infestation would not be found, regardless of what type of lice is involved. 

It seems to be that the only real requirement for solar cooking is sunshine and the more the better. There are a few disadvantage to cooking with solar energy. 

For further information on this subject please take a look at this entire article: Effects of Sport Hunting Mountain Lions on Safety and Livestock. The article, charts and photos are quite interesting.

I am not sure, I would take this hike if I were inexperienced. At a minimum, please talk over your plans with an experienced local guide. Personally I would take a guide. 

Teach kids the S.T.O.P. acronym: Stop, Think, Observe, Plan. Stop the minute that they realize that they’re lost. 

It has been a while since I actually did fishing on a beach, but when I do, it is always with someone. We usually get there early enough so we can get some bait for fishing (sea worms from under the rocks). For getting your line farther out into the ocean, you could go with either suggestion you mentioned. I could suggest getting a longer rod, as you would have better balance and movement than going into the water. Nevertheless, I would like to throw out a third possibility to you. If you are fishing with a friend, get him to hold onto your rod as he points it in the direction you would like to cast, keeping the bail open while you throw the line out by hand! What? Throwing the line out by hand! Take the slack part of you line and place yourself several meters away from your companion and start circling the end of your line over your head with the weights and baits. As the speed of your line turns faster, you should be able to detect an increasing buzzing sound around you. When the speed of your "lasso" is at its maximum, simply let it go in the direction you would like your line to travel in. Believe me this little trick will get your line much further out than any 14 foot rod. It works wonders. On occasion, I have done this without a friend, by simply placing my rod handle into a holder which I anchored into the sand. However I find that a friend holding your rod works better.
