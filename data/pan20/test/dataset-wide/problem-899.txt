So, yes, those languages should not technically exist within the Library. But the Library is a dazzling thought experiment; not a "real" or rigorously-speculated world. In the service of the thought experiment, real languages serve Borges far better than imaginary ones could. 

So, the cyclical book is God in the context of "what the mystics claim". The phrasing is a little ambiguous. It could imply that one of the mystics' claims is that there is a cyclical book, and another is that this cyclical book is God. Or, it might be the narrator's opinion that the cyclical book of which the mystics speak, is in fact -- in some manner -- God. The separation between the claim of the circular room, and the definition of the book as God -- particularly, by saying "their testimony is suspect; their words, obscure," which obviously isn't the mystic's own claim -- makes it seem like a remark by the narrator. So the easiest way to read this is, the narrator is mentioning a belief of the mystics, and pointing out that in the context of their beliefs, the cyclical book is God. You could interpret that as, for example: 

Though David Mitchell's novels differ wildly in style and substance, all occur within the same universe, with links between them - some subtle, some very central. I don't think the books are meant to be read as a series, in one particular sequence. But, are there any books which will spoil other books, or books which won't make sense without something that's been established in a previous book? Can I read the books in any order I like, or are there combinations or sequences that I should avoid? 

So these "star-cross'd" lovers will die to bury their parents' strife. Many of Shakespeare's tragedies end with the main characters dying, so it's likely that the audience already knew that the main characters would likely die, and the prologue might be slyly hinting that they will "take their [own] life" (although that line clearly means "take their lives [from forth the fatal loins ...]", thanks @DLosc!), but doesn't tell you anything about why this death comes about. The audience knows something sad is coming, but they don't know what it will be yet. In my opinion, this prologue sets you up to think that the suicide will be engineered by the lovers, perhaps of the "if we can't be together, life isn't worth it" variety. As you watch the play, however, things seems to get better and better for Romeo and Juliet while things get worse and worse for the Montagues and the Capulets: they meet! They fall in love! They get married! A cunning plan is hatched so that Juliet can run away from her family and be reunited with her husband! All this time, the audience is thinking, "Wait a minute, this is a tragedy? And the prologue told me that they're going to kill themselves? How will we get there from here?" And then, boom, a letter goes awry, Romeo decides to kill himself and, just like that, the audience knows where this is going. Without the prologue, they would spend Act 5 wondering if Romeo's plan can be stopped; with it, they are certain that his plan will succeed. This lends additional tragedy to the scenes of Romeo planning his death and Friar Laurence learning that Romeo doesn't know about the scheme, since the audience already knows that these schemes will fail, that Romeo will die, and that this will almost certainly lead to Juliet's own death. I'd argue that, without the prologue, Act 5 could have been longer, with more potential interruptions to Romeo's plan -- and further increasing the audience's hopefulness -- before a surprising finish. But Shakespeare opted to let the audience get ahead of the story, giving them a longer period of time to feel sad for the characters before their actions destroy their own lives. This makes this more like the end of Julius Caesar (where Caesar's ghost tells the non-history-buffs Brutus' final fate, who then has time to reconcile himself to it), rather than the end of Othello (where Iago's plan succeeds right to the end, when it is unexpectedly revealed and some small sense of justice is restored). It's also a bit like an episode of TV where the teaser shows you, say, a street covered with the debris from an explosion, and the audience then spends the rest of the show trying to work out how that happened. 

For the rest of the play, the characters are trying not to torment each other -- by ignoring each other, by trying to comfort one another, by laying bare their secrets. But always, there is something that keeps them from being able to hold their peace, that keeps them interacting and orbiting one round the other. Even if it's something so trivial as a burning desire for a looking glass. An important implication made throughout the play is that these three characters were put together deliberately, precisely because this exact combination would be so self-perpetuating: 

In conclusion: the Crimson Hexagon is the enticing, but impossible goal, that zealots uses as a hollow drive and justification for their destruction. 

In the finale of Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency, the protagonists release the Salaxalan ghost (in Wenton-Weakes' body) in the primordial past, to go fix his ship, when they realize this will doom humanity. Their solution is to go interrupt Coleridge's composition of Kubla Khan -- which in the story is a poem based on the ghost's story, explanation, and request for help. How does this stop Wenton-Weakes and the ghost from fixing their ship? It clearly doesn't stop the ghost from possessing Wenton-Weakes, or from being released in the past (the protagonists say there are now two ghosts - the original one, and now also the one that returned to the past, and has been stuck there another eternity). And, of course, the change to the poem is billions of years later than the change-point where the ghost tries to fix the ship. (The book's prologue offers a clue - a visual that, in retrospect, we understand as some version of the ghost, crying in anguish at Coleridge being interrupted. But that's not very clear either.) 

I think the theme of I, Robot is that robots are more than simple monsters that will eventually destroy humanity, but can be sophisticated creatures even if their behaviour is governed by very simple rules: the Three Laws of Robotics. According to Wikipedia, Asimov found previous depictions of robots to be very one-dimensional: 

The original claim isn't that characters break the fourth wall, just that they are aware that they are fictional. In TV Tropes terms, this is leaning on the fourth wall or lampshading. (Not coincidentally, both use the same line from Twelfth Night as a page quote!). Many of these examples "could also be interpreted in other, non-immersion-breaking ways", but I'd argue that an audience watching a play on a stage with a literal proscenium would not fail to notice that the actors are commenting on the play in progress. Here are some examples from the Leaning on the Fourth Wall page: 

Ah, but the prologue doesn't spoil the ending of Romeo and Juliet! Take a look at those lines again: 

Hypsipyle is a lost or fragmentary play written around 410 BC by the Greek playwright Euripedes. This particular fragment might have survived from its inclusion in Book IV of Symposiacs by the Greek/Roman biographer and essayist Plutarch, who lived between AD 46 â€“ AD 120. So this is likely a fragment of Hypsipyle that we only know about because Plutarch quoted it in his book ~500 years after the play was written. 

According to the Wikipedia page on Hercule Poirot and based on quotations from Curtain, Poirot died in October 1949, thirty-three years after he first met Captain Hastings in June 1916. (He wasn't actually retired by that point, but he was a refugee escaping from World War I: it's unclear when exactly he retired). We know that he was a detective with the Brussels police force by 1893, when he tried to solve the case of The Chocolate Box. If we assume that he was 20-40 years old in 1893, he would have been born between 1853 and 1873, fled as a refuge to Britain at the age of 43 to 63, and would have died somewhere around the age of 76 to 96, which makes sense to me. If he was 55 when he moved to Britain -- at or around retirement age -- that gives us a birth year of 1861 and a death age of 88. 

Note that the realization that the characters are their own tormentors is made clear quite early in the play: 

Also, take a look at this image and house-plan for a house called The Four Gables. This is a design where, clearly, there is no possible place for a fifth gable. Each direction of the house is already taken; above the gables, the house ends in a single point. Hypothetically, you might stretch the house out, add another story above the crossed gables ("Perhaps they would hurt her so deeply that she could at last ascend to the fifth gable"), but that would seen like very odd architecture, and less likely to be described as a four-gabled house to begin with. Possibly More? Google shows me that additional configurations with four gables are entirely possible, e.g. this one, in the gardens of Burrswood Hospital: 

The portrait, unquestionably, is of Bill Cosey. But the leap that Junior makes -- from tough-as-nails, look-out-for-number-one survivor, to imagining a dead man as her personal protector -- seems to me surprising, out of character, and pretty arbitrary. Why does Junior "adopt" Cosey and cast him into the role of her "Good Man"? What does this signify about her character? Are we meant to understand her as being insane, unstable -- or is this part of her character more thematic? What theme is being expressed here - and how does such an instant, intense, intimate imaginary connection to Cosey fit in with the rest of the book, thematically? 

I don't think the story's message is about men, so much as it is about toxic relationships, and common expectations from women. 

P. G. Wodehouse is known as a consumate stylist, and a lot is known about how he plotted and wrote his novels. Did he ever say anything about his writing in the first person? I'm particularly curious about how he wrote "as" Bertie Wooster, who has a very distinctive writing style that differs in some ways from Wodehouse's own. Has he (or his biographers) written anything about how he developed Bertie's "voice" and then sustained it consistently across ten novels and over thirty short stories over 59 years? 

In-universe, Nadsat is Russian-inflected cockney slang spoken amongst teenagers in the novel's dystropian future England. Out-of-universe, Wikipedia says that Burgess "knew that if he used modes of speech that were contemporarily in use, the novel would very quickly become dated. His use of Nadsat was essentially pragmatic; he needed his narrator to have a unique voice that would remain ageless while reinforcing Alex's indifference to his society's norms, and to suggest that youth subculture existed independently of the rest of society." 

@yaitloutou has a great answer, but there's three reasons they've miss out on that I'd like to include here: 

The robots in I, Robot are specifically engineered to not be directly dangerous: it is impossible for them to "rise up" against humans, and are deeply compelled to serve humanity (except by hurting other humans). They range from simple beings, such as robots who have a nervous breakdown or go into denial, to incredibly complex creatures, such as a robot who runs for public office, a robot who literally "gets lost" and -- my personal favourite -- the robot who lies. To respond to the answers previously posted here, I don't think Asimov is specifically saying that robots may be dangerous or unpredictable or human, and I don't think the point is to do with the Three Laws specifically. I think Asimov is saying that machines who can think but whose thinking is designed to be limited may yet come up with complex behavior that we don't understand, but which makes perfect sense to them. Dr. Susan Calman, the "robot whisperer" who figures out why the robots are doing what they're doing on several occasions, acts as our translator, and without her the robots' actions might appear to be dangerous or unpredictable or human, but Asimov shows us in all these stories that they arise only from simple rules and logic. A more modern perspective on I, Robot might be the theme of complex behavior arising from simple rules, or emergent behavior -- especially prominent in stories where robots appear to be behaving erratically, but are revealed to be trying to stay within the strictures of their programming. But I don't know if that's what Asimov was thinking of. In terms of writing, an interesting comparison might be Ronald Knox's "Ten Commandments" of detective fiction: you could think of the I, Robot stories (and all of Asimov's robot fiction) as Asimov restricting what he could do (no directly killing humans! robots must obey any order except those that kill humans!) and still come up with a compelling mystery, detective story or dystropian world.
