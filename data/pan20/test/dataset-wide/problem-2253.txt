Being dogmatic about it turns everyone off. Using LNT as a practical means of addressing real issues in a reasonable way is hard to argue against. 

I ride a lot and have never seen any gadgets for fixing this. It depends on the snow as well, since the bigger wetter stuff (so cal / washington mountains) tends to be much more of a problem than the bone dry stuff (co / slc mountains). Worse is that in conditions with lots of snow coming down you may want to wear goretex shell mitts, and regardless you'll have snow all over your hands since.... well... it's snowing. I wipe my goggles off when I start going down a run with the sleeves of my jacket, and then I stop as often as I need to and rewipe, or do it during a non-technical stuff where I can move my upper body about. If it's really dumping clumpy snow, it's going to get on your goggles and it's going to limit your visibility, there's not really anyway around that. But hey, it's powder. Keep the nose up, weight the back, and shred. If you start losing visibility to the point that you're unable to see contours and terrain angles, it might be time to hit the lodge and grab a beer. 

At temperatures around 100f, it rapidly disolves into sodium carbonate, carbon dioxide, and water. And that's without interaction from other chemicals, which will happen naturally, and hasten the decomposition (especially any acid). Rain water is generally acidic, so rain in any quantity breaks down baking soda very quickly (like in minutes). Specifically related to teeth cleaning, a 2008 study had this to say: 

You can still buy those coolers at area grocery stores. If you're headed out of San Diego (where I'm at), I could give you the names of specific locations. There are also processors that will be waiting for you at the dock (in every major sport fishing location I've seen) that will chop and paper your catch. I think you could go from there, to a grocery store, and then get some dry ice (if you want that route) and cheap foam coolers. It's worth noting that the foam coolers are rightly losing their appeal as they are viewed as disposable, and they generate considerable waste. 

Baking soda (sodium bicarbonate). It's naturally occurring, and to get a level of toxicity to animals you would need to get to 450mg per liter. Unless you're operating a mine or using literally tons of the stuff, it's quite safe and you'll never get near that. From a 2008 USGS study: 

From the WMA emergency medical protocol (WFR's and WEMT's): Urgent evacuation to higher level care is required if fever, swelling, or severe pain is present. Although the pain of dental infection can be extreme, the more critical issues are related to the spread of infection. Patients with more serious infections will show facial swelling and fever. In the field, temporary pain relief can be obtained with topical pain relievers like Orabase or oil of cloves, and with oral or injectable pain medication. If immediate evacuation is not possible, high dose antibiotics and warm compresses should be initiated. In extreme circumstances, the tooth can be pulled, and it should be remembered that until quite recently in dental history pulling the tooth was the definitive treatment. Regarding your specific questions: 

Different land managers have different takes on this so I don't think you're going to get a solid answer that applies across all areas. I generally use the term "trail camp" to describe what you're talking about. An area with up turned rocks for sitting and doing stuff on, a fire ring, some flat spots for sleeping, etc. I've never dismantled a single one, personally. I have a part time guide business, and one of the rules for us (US National Parks and US National Forests) is that our groups need to spread out across multiple campsites when possible. So if we have a party of ten with two guides, we'll break into two groups of five with a guide each and use two campsites. So while you might be looking at things through a lens of "one group can just use x instead of y", there are groups that need to use both x and y on occasion. Equestrian groups have even weirder requirements but I don't really know about those, other than the simple math that they have big animals that need to go somewhere and the people need to be a bit (but not too far) away. For whatever it's worth, even in areas where fires are allowed we rarely start them. Under a commercial permit we're required to use existing trail camps whenever possible. 

As stated above, it can be, although I would advise that it can sometimes be difficult to know exactly which tooth is infected and it's entirely possible you'll pull the wrong one out. 

In the marine environment, it's often a little easier if you reference a known location. Offshore, you want to use lat/lon coordinates for sure. But if you're a mile from the coast (or less), it's a lot easier for people to find you if you say "We're a hundred yards south of buoy three, looking at the hotel with the red roof." I worked for a water rescue service for a bit, and it takes time and clarity to hear a full string of coordinates across a VHF connection. Also, if you're a single minute of latitude or longitude off, that's a big difference. Plus, those same coordinates need to be manually plugged into a chartplotter, which takes time and can't be done while the boat is racing towards you. But the people who are coming to get you inshore on the water are very familiar with the coastline and will know buoy #3 instantly, and there's no way you're going to know the red roofed hotel unless you're really staring at it. So while not to discount coordinates, stating what you can see around you is a great confirmation and at least where I worked would get me headed in your direction ~30 seconds faster and with a bit more certainty. 

As others have commented, I would focus on practicality and then start bringing up the LNT doctrine. I have two little kids I go backpacking with. The last time out I explained that if we walked ~50 steps from the trail to take a whizz that it created a much bigger area of potential whizz sites than if we only walked ~20 steps. For trash, I just point out how gross it is and how it's important that we pack out more than we packed in. The LNT principles are just that: principles. They're not hard and fast guidelines. In some places concepts like packing out toilet paper is honestly ridiculous, and in other places you really do need to crap in a bag and carry it out. As important as LNT is, I approach it like this:
