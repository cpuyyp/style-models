Can eating too much protein be bad for you? Answered under the premise that protein shakes are a direct protein supplement to diet, ignoring their detailed composition and basing answer on the above title. As with ALL supplements, read and understand the ingredients list and what makes those ingredients up. Look for full disclosure of ingredients on the labels and you can always check most supplements on labdoor.com. Click the next link for a comprehensive answer tailored to Whey Protein Healthy kidneys When looking at active male athletes and measuring urinary creatinine, albumin, and urea no significant changes were seen in protein dosage ranges of 1.28-2.8g/kg bodyweight.2 The aforementioned study lasted 7 days, but survey research supports this lack of association (in post-menopausal women). 2 Too much, too fast There do appear to be functional changes in the kidneys related to protein intake [4]. As protein does modulate renal function,[5][6] these interactions may lead to damage if imposed acutely onto mice (from 10-15% of the diet, up to 35-45% of the diet immediately)[7][8] and one study in healthy humans going from 1.2g/kg to 2.4g/kg (doubling) was associated with higher than normal blood values of protein metabolites; a trend was noted for adaptation (increasing GFR) but it was not enough to clear uric acid and BUN over 7 days.[9] These studies are likely indicative of a 'too much, too fast' situation, as controlled changes do not lead to adverse changes in kidney function.[10] Thus, it would be prudent to slowly change protein intake over a moderate length of time. Damaged or unhealthy kidneys Restricted protein diets are recommended for those with kidney damage, as it slows the seemingly inevitable progression of kidney damage.[11][12] If protein was not controlled for in those with renal damage, it would accelerate (or at least not reduce) the decline in function.[3] The role of the Kidneys Kidneys can acutely increase the Glomerular filtration rate (GFR), or the rate of filtration of the blood. They do this in response to dietary protein intake[13], and the lack of this compensation in some forms of kidney damage are a reason protein intake is controlled for in kidney disease management.[14] Additionally, the kidneys serve to regulate acid-base balance in the body via the sodium-bicarbonate buffering system.[15] Disorders in acid:base balance can further pathophysiology (symptoms and signs of the disease) of renal complications.[16][17] These protective measures appear to be preserved in healthy kidneys, but begin to fail when they kidneys are otherwise damaged. In Summary: 

Continuing the theme of free-weight work you could try the following (for 3-5 sets of 8-15 reps, tracking and increasing weight slowly over time), those in bold are strongly recommended. Outside of isolation, if you aren't doing power cleans, you should! Shoulders: 

In terms of developing the strength of your abdominals, both will work. Different exercises activate different muscles more or less. Generally, you cannot split out upper and lower abdominals by exercise and both mentioned exercises will activate both. 

It means that, for example: If resting heart rate is 50bpm and VO2 Max HR is 200 bpm (easy numbers), then your 'working heart rate' for the majority of your speed work should be 90% of your VO2 HRMax, (90% of 200 = 180 bpm). Working heart rate is your average heart rate during the exercise. If you have a watch-style monitor readout then if you checked it during the sprints you would expect to see around 180bpm. Using something like Strava Premium (paid service) or Garmin Connect (free with a Garmin HR Monitor) can help you understand how your heart rate changes through the exercise, eg: 

To answer your question: Why is coconut milk used so much by sportsmen and women? Nutritional content: 

Welcome to the boring-but-big method! (more correctly, a modified version of it) BBB is a assistance program for traditional intermediate strength workouts (5/3/1 being where this was popularised). The concept was made popular by Jim Wendler though his version of 5/3/1 and you can read more in his book. However, by aiming for 1000 over 10 workouts you will end up doing 10x10 instead of 5x10 (sets x reps). This method is closer to German Volume training, which focuses on using 10x10 for main lifts. Personally, you only really want to be doing 10 sets of anything if you are looking to push lower working weight (60% 1RM) and stimulate growth. Jim makes it clear that he only does 5 sets because more would be counterproductive to your other exercises and you could use the second 5x10 to effectively develop another portion of your lifts. IT's also worth noting the different volume stimulates muscles differently. People regularly accept that for calf raises you should aim for ~50 reps total per session but for Squat, 20-30 reps is enough. 

Footnotes: Once you start running your weight will probably drop more than usual over a week or two, this is normal because your body is not used to it and will massively over-compensate. You'll probably also get DOMS, you can workout with DOMS, just do a gentle warm-up and they will melt away. Remember to hydrate during the day a lot so that you will not need to re-hydrate too much after exercise. 

Your body only builds muscle when you are resting. Hence, the importance of good sleep and at least 1 rest day a week. Without rest, you simply won't improve as much as you could be able to because of fatigue. There are so many factors at play here with sleep, ability, prior training, training cycle, diet, etc. to be able to say to what level the impact will be. Your answer will be unique. 

An Apple (or other fruit). After a workout it is highly likely that your glucose stores are depleted. Something healthy and containing some sugar will make you feel a lot better. 

Depends how effective your workouts were and how experienced at lifting you are prior to your break. 6-7 months is not long enough to drastically change your physique. Muscle growth will not suddenly happen when you return, it takes time and a lot of effort to grow muscle and requires you to constantly use it to maintain: "use it or lose it". Example 1: Person A is a novice and lifts weight for 6 months then take a break for 6 months and then returns. Person A should start back near the beginning (just the barbell, no weight) but will be able to progress back up to where they were over the space of 3-5 months. Example 2: Person B is experienced, has been working out for 5+ years, gets a personal best deadlift that puts them in the "Advanced" category. They take a 6 month break and return. Person B will be able to return and lift weight at a high-novice/intermediate level because their body will not have changed in those 6 months but it may take a long time (years even!) to get their personal best again. 

All exercise progression can benefit from the principle of progressive overload. You should (in the first year or so) try to push yourself to the same extent. Working until failure can be useful for building endurance but doing this every time you train can affect your recovery. If you push yourself to the same level of physical strain each workout then your ability to do that activity will improve, whether it be you running for longer or faster. With that in mind your workout goals should be adjusted to constantly challenge you. This is the principle of progressive overload. Provided you have a good fitness plan then you should trust and stick to it. Don't make it artificially harder. Finally, remember you have to do a "cooldown" after a run which should consist of a slow jog/walk and stretching. Working till exhaustion may diminish your ability to do this. 

I loathe picking apart posts, it makes me feel like a snarky nerd who insists on being "technically correct". However, your question has a not of incorrect information in it. 

L-Sit Progression Foot Supported L-sit Sit down on the ground with your legs straight in front of you. Put your hands next to your thighs and push yourself up (straight arms!), leaving your feet on the ground. Hold for the assigned time period. One-Leg Foot Supported L-sit Do a foot supported L-sit, but raise one of your legs up from the ground. Tuck L-sit Sit down on the floor with your legs bent (about 90 degree angle at the knee, 45 degree angle at the hip). Put your hands slightly in front of your butt and push yourself up (straight arms!). Advanced Tuck L-sit or One-Leg L-sit Either tuck less than before (extend your legs outwards), or stay tucked and extend only one leg straight like in a real L-sit. L-sit 

ExRx.net I cannot think of a better resource to learn about every exercise ever thought up. Most "new" exercises are variations on these. 

You will develop less bar control which means that when you do use a full length bar you wont be able to move as much weight. It really depends on your long term goals. 

1-6 reps (>85% 1RM) of work is generally accepted/acknowledged towards building Myofibril Hypertrophy (actual muscle fiber hypertrophy). Also increases overall strength (which influences #2 and #3) [1] 6-12 reps (70-85% 1RM) is work is generally accepted/acknowledged towards building Sarcoplasmic Hypertrophy (tissues surrounding the muscle fibers). [1] 12+ reps (<70% 1RM) develops mitochondria and fatigue resistance of a muscle, particularly Type I, predominantly aerobic fibers. Also allows you to tolerate more total work capacity. Note: Lower-intensity, longer-duration aerobic exercise generally does not result in very effective tissue hypertrophy; instead, endurance athletes enhance storage of fats and carbohydrates within the muscles [2] 

Protein: Your specific question To summarise, you are eating at a 45/35/25 split which is the standard recommendation for someone who is weightlifting and looking to gain muscle. It provides you with the protein you need to develop muscle in recovery, and the fats and carbohydrates you need to function and have energy. You estimate your BMR at 2700-3600 per day. This strikes me as a lot. Plugging your height, weight, age and gender into the iimym BMR calculator I get a BMR of 2064. With an average difference between my estimate and yours of 1000 calories, I recommend you have another look at how you calculated your BMR and perhaps re-do it across lots of calculators to get a sensible average. Note: If I plug in your exercise data I get a TDEE of 2500 calories per day. We shouldn't be the rock and eat 400g protein per day. Looking at the information I have presented above and the studies referenced it's fairly clear that your macronutrient breakdown (ratio of carb/fat/protein) is fine. What is made clear is you should perhaps look at how many calories you are consuming, below is one sites (iimym.com) recommendation:
