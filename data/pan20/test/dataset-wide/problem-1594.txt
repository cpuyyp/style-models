Now President Trump did say during the Alabama Senate Primary that Roy Moore would lose, or at least have a hard time winning, in the general election. But my question is, did he ever say that Ed Gillespie would lose the Governor's race in Virginia? 

These are, not coincidentally, the states that Republican Senators Lisa Murkowski, John McCain, Susan Collins, and Rand Paul represent. At least two of those four Senators need to vote for the Graham-Cassidy healthcare bill in order for it to pass. But my question is about the veracity of President Trump's claim. Now obviously "big winner" is a subjective term, but is it at least true that these four states are net beneficiaries of the Graham-Cassidy bill? Are there any estimates or analyses that back this claim up? 

President Trump's senior policy advisor Stephen Miller just said this in an interview with CNN's Jake Tapper: 

I'm interested in the part in bold. Obviously "made worse" is subjective. But President Trump wants to do away with the chain migration and the Diversity Visa Lottery Program. So is it true that the Gang of Six immigration plan expands those two things, thereby going in the opposite of President Trump's preferred direction? 

I'm interested in the part in bold. I think it's clear from context that Miller is not talking about, say, the African American community, but rather about immigrant communities who are coming into America and besieging Americans with crime. So my question is, is it true that there are high-crime immigrant communities in the US? 

My question is, is it true that President Trump has freed hundreds of children per month, and has broken up trafficking rings? 

My question is, is it true that a majority of grade-school children in Arizona are Hispanic? I assume there should be readily available statistics on this. 

This is a reference to an executive order President Trump issued earlier this year expanding the use of association health plans. My question is, is it true that millions of people joined association health plans after President Trump's executive order? 

This is a reference to the company Concord Catering, which special counsel Robert Mueller indicted as part of the Trump-Russia investigation. You see, in a court hearing on Wednesday, Eric Dubelier, the lawyer for the affiliated company Concord Management, claimed that Concord Catering did not even exist at the time of the activity they're being indicted for: 

It is however perhaps worth noticing that the question is slightly misleading. The encryption used elsewhere in GSM and other mobile networks only applies to the radio interface between the mobile phone and the cell tower. Within the network, phone calls are generally not encrypted anywhere and in most countries, phone network operators are obligated to provide law agencies interfaces to intercept phone calls. 

Yes, most pregnancy tests detect human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), a hormone produced by fertilized eggs, but also by some kinds of cancer cells. You can read more about different tumor markers on this info page from "The American Cancer Society". There are also several other situations where a pregnancy test may give a false positive result (both for men and non-pregnant women). The Wikipedia article lists several possibilities: 

If we follow the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's definition of chronic fatigue syndrom, a CFS diagnosis requires the following (among other) criterion to be fulfilled: 

There are several studies examining the intake of glyphosate, in many cases even deliberate intakes as a method of suicide. Most of these studies are not freely accessible (behind pay-walls), but in the abstract of the following study, you can find some numbers: Acute poisoning with a glyphosate-surfactant herbicide ('Roundup'): a review of 93 cases. 

If we look at the statistics from "Brottsförebyggande rådet" (BRÅ), the actual number for the entire country are as expected quite a bit higher. In the first 7 months of 2013, there were in total 3,426 reports on rape or rape attempt. In 1,133 cases, the victim was below the age of 15 (1,004 girls and 129 boys). The most recent statistics on crime among immigrants seem to be this report from BRÅ, dated 2005. The report does not quote any absolute numbers, but on page 42, the relative risk of being accused for different kind of crimes is listed for the three categories "born in Sweden, both parents born in Sweden", "born in Sweden, at least one parent born outside Sweden" and "born outside Sweden". For rape and rape attempts, the relative risks for these three categories are 1.0, 1.8 and 5.0. Now, looking to find the percentage of the total population falling into each of these three groups, "Statistiska centralbyrån" offers the numbers for the year 2008: Born in Sweden, both parents born in Sweden: 75% Born in Sweden, at least one parent born abroad: 11% Born abroad: 14% With the known risk of correlating three different statistics collected over a range of 8 years, the number of perpetrators in each of the three population groups (considering their share of the total population and relative crime risk) should be approximately: Born in Sweden, both parents born in Sweden: 1557 Born in Sweden, at least one parent born abroad: 415 Born abroad: 1454 Summing it up: Of the 3,426 reported rapes or rape attempts in the first 7 months of 2013, some 1900 can be assumed to have been performed by a perpetrator born outside Sweden or with at least one parent born outside Sweden. This is where it seems impossible to get any further with the analysis. There are no public statistics regarding the religion of the foreign-born population and also no crime statistics with a more detailed breakdown of the nationality or religion of the crime suspects. Even if the Swedish Radio news report is misquoted and there are no further backups for the claim, it is not completely unrealistic, that 1000 of the assumed 1900 foreign rapists are Muslims. 

Anyone with common sense and google can find these. There are no "secrets" or "kickstarts" for dieting. If anything, dieting as a temporary behaviour has been shown generally not to work. It needs to be an overall behavioural modification. As I said earlier, it's not something that is easy to do. The effort required is generally much more than the effort folks are willing to put into it. 

Okay, enough fun, how about serious studies? Well, one scientist comes right out and asks why scientists in his field are atheists. Sean Carrol of CalTech concludes in a paper: 

This interest may have been sparked by a 2000 airing on the History Channel about this same phenomenon. Skeptical inquirer made a point to also talk about this. A web archive link is reproduced below (to prevent link rot): 

Keep in mind, these books are specifically marketed to homeschooling christians, and christian schools that currently are not part of the publicly funded education system. As such, they should not be in the public schools, although given the behaviour of legislators in Louisiana, I think many wish these books were in there. Keep in mind, these books are not only in Louisiana. As the interview link states: 

An additional collection of articles can be found at this Discover Magazine Blog post by Andrew Moseman. It starts out saying: 

The National Radio Astronomy Observatory has a great article about actually observing some of the early stages involved in star formation. Again, while not everything is understood, they are gathering more clues. 

There are no credible sightings for Elvis. In actuality, a real Elvis sightinig ranks up there with the Ivory Billed Woodpecker, Bigfoot, or Chupecabra. This website has Elvis's death certificate, autopsy report, and exhumation examination posted on it. There was some controversy about the cause of death, and the final attribution. One of Elvis's doctors was under investigation for malpractice (and considering the prescriptions in Elvis's possession, with good cause). 

In the paper, they go into a great deal of detail on not only the thixotropic hypothesis, but also to talk about other rational approaches to the problem. Not only focusing on the thixotropic hypothesis but other possible hoaxes, frauds, or mistakes. The prevailing idea is that this is indeed a fake though, since the chemistry has been known since about the time that this "relic" appeared. This PDF is an extended version of the paper cited above 

The calculation you're linking to assumes 20,000 hours of work during residency. According to Wikipedia's section on residency in the United States, the residency usually lasts for one year (state dependent) and the number of working hours is limited to 80 per week. That makes a maximum of 4,160 hours, which is not even close to the number used in the claim. 

The political parties (R, SV, Ap, ..., H, FrP, Andre = others) are roughly arranged from left to right in the same order you would arrange them on a political left/right wing scale. If we first take a look at the most leftish and rightish parties, your claim first seem to be backed up by the statistics. At the far-left, we find The Red Party (R) and the Socialist Left Party (SV) with a much higher support among the better educated voters (0/1/2% and 4/5/12% for the three education level groups). At the far right, we find the Progress Party (FrP) with a much higher support among the less educated voters (31/26/9%). If we however look at the two larger "traditional" left/right wing parties in Norway, the Labour Party (Ap) and the Conservative Party (H), the distribution is opposite (46/35/32% for the Labour Party and 7/17/27% for the Conservative Party). The last three parties, the Liberal Party (V), the Christian Democratic Party (KrF) and the Centre Party (Sp) are usually categorized as centrist parties without any clear left/right wing classification. If we group the parties as well in left wing (R, SV, Ap), centrist (V, KrF, Sp) and right wing (H, FrP), the support cross-referenced with the education level group adds up to 50/41/46% (left wing), 11/16/18% (centrist) and 38/43/36% (right wing). Even if these numbers indicate a slight skew in one or another direction, they can at least not be used to backup your original claim. If at all, they seem to indicate the well-educated people tend to prefer centrist parties. 

Yes, these ratios are actually correct. The number of Algerians charged with a criminal offence is relative to the population count 54 times higher than the number of charged Norwegians. 29,516 of roughly 4.5 million Norwegian citizens were charged with a criminal offence in 2010, while 128 Algerians faced the same faith of a population of 362. Likewise, 700 of the 1561 Vietnamese citizens living in Norway were reported unemployed, making the unemployment ratio 36 times higher than among the Norwegian citizens. Worth to notice is perhaps also, that only immigrants from three countries show a crime ratio <1:
