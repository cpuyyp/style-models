A lot of the success of humans comes from their ability to cooperate and cooperation depends on being able to predict other people's behaviour. Indeed predictable behaviour is arguably the foundation of morality. A lot of the logic behind this is covered by Game Theory which provides a mathematical framework for decisions such as cooperation vs cheating and this can help unpick the more complex aspects of social cooperation. Morality also goes hand in hand with the ability to imagine the consequences of one's actions and the ability to defer an immediate benefit for the sake of a greater long term gain. Equally this sort of speculative decision making and the ability to learn from past experiences depends a lot on attaching emotions to memories and imagined outcomes and these emotional responses tend to be more powerful than purely rational lines of argument. It is also very important that evolution, by its very nature, favours the survival of genes not a specific individual. Something well illustrated by hive insects where the vast majority of individuals never get to reproduce but are all so closely related that they are working for the survival of a shared pool of genes which could almost be considered a single organism from an evolutionary perspective. Evolution is also a brute force optimisation process which effectively follows the path of least resistance at every stage and involves vast complexity and as such isn't always easy to rationalise from first principals and tends to produce solutions which can seem odd from a human perspective as it works purely on results and has no long term intent. With this in mind it is fairly easy to see how an instinct to care for children is an evolutionary advantage, especially as human children need a lot of looking after for a long time. What is less obvious is the advantages of wider family , social and cultural connections. There is also a reasonable argument that what you might call 'emotional morality' is a very efficient mechanism for social decision making. It is probably misleading to suggest that humans evolved morally specifically. But there is certainly a good case that evolution has equipped us with the ability to construct moral codes which build on the fundamentals of social cooperation. 

For Capitalism The capitalist is likely to speak of capitalism being conducive to human freedom (freedom to buy and sell, enter into contracts), and to the generation of wealth and prosperity for mankind. He is likely to speak of its efficiency with respect to classical economics - the invisible hand through the price mechanism equilibrates supply and demand, so that the market clears (everyone is satisfied). And possibly, that capitalism encourages thrift and industry - which are virtues (although, this is susceptible to the immediate retort that we are conditioned to think of these as virtues, because they are useful within capitalism, not because they have any timeless worth). 

Understanding capitalism requires understanding a constellation of concepts that reinforce each other. I'll try to make some headway here. A helpful way to think about capital is as the aggregate of all non-labour inputs to production. Some would include land as a factor of production as well, and some others would consider human capital to be a form of capital (typically when explaining why capital in aggregate does not run up against the problem of diminishing marginal returns.) The defining characteristic of capitalism is that capital is privately owned. As you can see, it is compatible with a great diversity of political systems (ranging from the illiberal democracies of Singapore, to the authoritarianism of China, to the democracies in the West). Because capital is privately owned, it is typically invested in such a way as to maximise profit. This isn't necessarily the case, and some people might invest their private wealth in non-profit organisations. But the dominant paradigm is typically acquisition for private gain. The term became popular in its modern usage sometime in the middle of the 19th century, possibly slightly earlier. Marx was probably not the originator, but he was definitely contemporaneous with others who did. Potentially Proudhon and socialists of other stripes. Since then the left has kept this usage alive, together with the oft-mentioned 'bourgeois mode of production' - which is essentially synonymous. 

Or more simply stated, qualia is what a conscious mind experiences. So why should we doubt our qualia? This is the age old debate between the rationalist and the empiricist, the hard-line empiricist stating all we can trust is our experiences, and the hard-line rationalist saying only trust reason. This being of course a very shallow summary of the debate. There are many hypothetical arguments on why to doubt qualia, the inverted qualia thought experiment for example... however I believe you are looking for something more concrete. In that case we can go to something that everyone has experience with... Dreams, dreams are the strongest example that we can in fact be mistaken about our qualia. We can tweak some of the ideas in Descartes' Meditations to derive a convincing argument that we cannot always trust our qualia. There might be people who deny that they have ever been immersed in a realistic dream, only to awake and realize their experiences for the past few hours do not exist in the objective world, but we doubt their sincerity in such maters. 

Now not knowing anything about Hegel I of course do not know enough to get the joke, aside from the obvious juxtaposition in the pictures. What is this le sacre monstre according to Hegel, and why do the 3 views/person see it the way they do? 

This thing is that nobody argues that colour is a strictly material property. Like many things in nature colour perception is an evolutionary bodge to allow organic brains to make sense of a continuous spectrum of visible electromagnetic radiation. There is no real concept of colour in physics as in deed there is no real concept of colours outside of visible light, we don't ascribe different colours to x-rays or radio waves simply because humans don't have the biological mechanisms to detect them directly. Equally humans perceive three primary colours because (most) humans have three different types of wavelength sensitive cells in their eyes and even then they are not really red/yellow/blue as such but more blue/green/orange and the brain does a lot of post-processing as it does with all aspects of vision and even in a specific brain colour values are relative compare to the colour values in an overall scene. So any though experiment revolving around vision is already on shaky ground because the neural processing mechanisms are complex and still relatively poorly understood and certainly counter-intuitive. Equally if human vision were just monochrome, which is pretty easy to imagine and indeed a reality for some people I'm not sure that make any major difference to the philosophical basis for materialism. The fundamental question is whether consciousness is a material process, determined by the same physical laws as all matter or something different. the other side of the coin is that recognising colours is now fairly trivial for AI 

I believe the simple answer would be that this intelligence is not naturally occurring, but engineered or created. Once created it learns naturally, but there is still the prerequisite of being created. 

The difference between nihilism and and existentialism is that nihilism proclaims that there is no meaning, whereas existentialism (mostly) states that each individual must decide their own meaning. The Myth of Sisyphus written by Camus speaks of rolling a rock up a hill over and over only to have it fall back down. This is an interesting metaphor and Camus' argument against nihilism. The last two lines of the story I have quoted below, but you shoulds really read the entirety in a sitting when you have time. 

Ah qualia, a source of much controversy in the field of philosophy of mind, some deny it entirely (What really?) others argue about what exactly it is... Before we talk more about it, let us loosely define what it is exactly : 

Coherentism Note their view on skeptisim of an external world (Brain in a vat / trapped in virtual reality / universe is a simulation arguements) 

I found the Oxford Handbook of Epistemology quite helpful. It does a great job at clearly defining what each view or topic in epistemology is, before diving into the problems, virtues, and arguments for and against each view. There is a ton of information in it (around 600 pages) and I have yet to finish it, but it is very readable and a great reference. I checked the index and unfortunately Hypnagogia is not contained within the book bindings. The titles of the chapters within are as follows 

Anti-capitalisms (two main types, with many sub-types) 1. A Normative Critique The main line here is that capitalism is unjust and causes us to detract from the good life. There is substantial trove of academic debate on whether Marx himself thought capitalism was unjust. (c.f. Norman Geras, "The Controversy about Marx and Justice). The most common type of this critique is - capitalism leads to inequality in resources. Some people may regard this as intrinsically negative, which is up for debate. But this inequality typically translates into unequal political influence - which we see in the form of corporate lobbyists and other distortions to the democratic process. Some other normative critiques (nowhere near exhaustive): Capitalism is exploitative - maximising profit involves underpaying workers and denying them the fair share of the revenues. Capitalism is coercive - while people may seem to voluntarily enter into labour contracts, the reality is that they have very little other option. Back in the day when peasants had some land - they could get by on subsistence farming. The modern-day proletarian has no such option. Notice that it is not an issue of whether the proletarian (working-class man) is better off or not, it is an issue of whether he is free to choose or not. Capitalism is alienating - it prevents us from working in the right sort of way, that which actualises our potential. We are stuck doing pointless jobs - like waiting fast food tables, when simple etiquette would do without it, or shuffling papers within an engorged bureaucracy, telemarketing, or roadsweeping, when machines can do it so much better. Because what maximises profit doesn't necessarily coincide with what develops our potential, there is a problem. Capitalism also alienates us from our fellow man - we see each other as potential consumers, or labour, which prevents us from relating in a dignity-preserving way. 2. An Efficiency Critique Capitalism is inefficient, and squanders our natural resources. In the Marxian lingo you would hear about capitalism being 'a fetter on the productive forces' at some point in future (1859 Preface to a Critique of Political Economy). The idea is that the productive forces (labour, machinery, natural resources...) have a tendency to develop, and the relations of production we choose have a bearing on how effectively the productive forces can develop. Capitalism has unleashed great productivity, but those who subscribe to a Marxian view of history are pessimistic about whether it will always be conducive to the development of the productive forces. From the Greens (environmentalists) you might hear about how capitalism takes a myopic view and systematically disregards environmental externalities. When selfish interests dominate government policy-making on the environment, there is wanton environmental degradation in the service of profit. This is often brought across in ethical terms - but considerations of natural resource scarcity lead me to consider it an efficiency-based critique, at least in part. Hope this helps! 

A Facebook group Philosophy Matters posts philosophy related jokes from time to time. Today they posted this image : 

So really your acquaintance almost hit the nail on the head when they claimed you were describing except what he REALLY meant was as you pointed out. The "Objectivist" is not arguing from an "Is" to an "Ought" but from an "I want" to an "ought" and as such, they really have an even bigger gap to close, if they want to provide a gap closing rationale. 

It seems like you are worried that betting on your life might cause you to die somehow through some kind of supernatural means. This is just your personal superstition at work. You will not magically die because of your bluff. However, if you bet on your life to someone that might decide to extract revenge on you, there is the possibility that they might try to make you pay your self proclaimed stakes. This bet might be OK in casual circumstances with friends, but don't verbalize it inside of any crime rings. 

I will attempt to contest this point under the rules of the thought experiment. I'm assuming when you say "you" you mean a "me" on twin earth. and
