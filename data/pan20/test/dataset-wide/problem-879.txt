Quasars are not near the Earth. The nearest one is 600 million light years away. Most are much much further. They are so very far away that they appear very dim. The brightest quasar is only visible with a telescope, where it appears like a dim star. The total amount of energy from a quasar per square metre on Earth is minute. It is not a sensible source of energy. Quasars are just too far away. 

It must orbit the sun in the same direction as the Earth and other planets. The main difficulty in sending a transport to the station will be the the velocity change needed to put the transport into the station's orbit. If the orbit is retrograde with respect to the Earth, then the transport needs to make a massive change of velocity to reach the station, and this needs a massive amount of fuel. If, on the other hand, the station is prograde with respect to the earth, then the transfer can be made with an economical Hohmann transfer. This is much more important than any apparent benefit of a retrograde orbit passing close to the Earth more often. 

The East to West motion of the stars of Orion is due to the rotation of the Earth. The Milky Way also moves across the sky during the night for exactly the same reason. The stars that form Orion do not transverse the milky way. They remain in exactly the same position relative to the Milky Way. You are simply mistaken in thinking that the Milky way remains in the same position.

I can't speak for the general case; I'm not aware that cubic splines are always used for modelling light curves. However, a cubic spline is the lowest order of spline that allows for inflection points, thus offering a good combination of flexibility with simplicity. A cubic spline could fit an arbitrary smooth curve with only a few control points. It is also offered in many data analysis and drawing packages. In the paper, the authors are fitting a light curve by eye. Cubic splines are an "obvious" way of doing this. 

No. This doesn't follow. It is not the case that there is a void, for if there were, the plasma would flow into it. In fact density increases with depth. 

It is not a perpetual motion machine. Energy is being converted from gravitational potential energy in the gas, to motion, and eventually to heat which is lost as heat radiation. As this happens the planet shrinks and cools. This takes a long time, a lot longer than the few billion years of the the solar system. But ultimately convection will stop. All life forms depend on capturing energy. All life processes increase entropy. Life can have a significant effect on a planet, but not by "consuming energy" rather by changing the composition of the atmosphere. 

You can use a package such as the pyephem package for python. It can calculate the position of any astronomical object. However for the sun since it moves along the ecliptic, roughly at a uniform rate, you can approximate the position by doing coordinate transformations. The sun's longitude moves by 365.24/360 degrees a day from 0 at the vernal equinox and has an ecliptic latitude of 90 degrees. This can be converted into equatorial coordinates (right ascension and declension), and then, given the hour, the alt and az positions can be found. The formulae can all be found on $URL$ 

What you ask for does not exist. There is no standard for what the patterns are. In modern astronomy, the constellations are areas of the sky. You can find lists of the stars in each area, but it seems that you want only the stars in the "pattern". When you see a star map, lines are sometimes drawn between the brighter stars. These help people to compare the stars to the map, our brains like to look for connections, and so linking the stars together helps us to make sense of the sky. However different stellar-cartographers will draw the lines in different ways. Consider Gemini: 

Originally a year would be noticed as the time between two winters (or two harvests, two annual floods etc), although the exact number of days might not be known with any accuracy. As people start to observe the sun more carefully, it would be noticed that the position of sunrise and sunset move regularly. Stonehenge and other ancient monuments seem aligned to midwinter sunset or midsummer sunrise. Since this would allow one to predict the seasons, it would have been very useful. More careful observations led to the geocentric model, in which the sun takes just over 365 days to move around the Earth once relative to the background stars. The length of the year was known to be about 365.25 days since the times of the ancient Egyptians. 

As you see the calculated values are much too large (ie wrong). They are comparable with values supposed to have been found by Hipparchus, but without a known observational basis. Tycho Brahe also gave similar values, found by sighting through a pinhole. This simple method doesn't give a good estimate of the angular size. The simple pattern in the calculated values is due to the original assumption that the globes were in an arithmetic sequence. There is then a calculation of the geocentric orbital radii of the planets. They assume that Venus, Mercury and the Sun all orbit at a distance of 3.4 million miles. This is a significant underestimate, especially for the sun (this is wrong). The distances to Mars, Jupiter and Saturn were also underestimated. One can then combine the apparent angular diameter (which is too large) with the calculated distance (which was too small) to obtain an estimate of the planetary diameter. When this is done, it gives exceedingly good estimates of the diameter of Mercury and Saturn (within 1%). A good estimate for the diameter of Mars (about 10% out), and a poor estimate for Venus and Jupiter (about 50% of the accepted modern values). It is clear that there is much that is wrong. A combination of overestimates of some values and underestimates of others cancels out to give some impressive looking figures for two out of five planets. But do note that the estimates for Jupiter and Venus were a long way out, and all the numbers which the calculations were based on were wrong. In total there are 15 values calcuated here 5 apparent diameters, 5 geocentric distances and 5 actual diameters. Of these only 2 values are impressively accurate. They did better than other pre-telescopic observers, but it isn't clear that they obtained values by anything other than luck. Source 

The list on Wikipedia looks current. It doesn't list planets that have only been detected as one-off microlensing events. This can detect Jupiter sized objects (with considerable uncertainty in mass). But observing a microlensing doesn't allow for study, so a microlensing is not considered to be enough evidence for naming or cataloging a known planet. So the short answer is no Earth sized rogue planets are known. This is entirely due to the difficulty in detection. An Earth sized rogue planet would cool on its surface to a few degrees above absolute zero, and be undetectable with current telescopes. Microlensing events with small rogue planets would also be smaller and harder to detect above noise. An Earth sized rogue planet has a perfectly good inertial frame, (it is the bound planets that are in a rotating, non-inertial frame), nor does a frame of reference have anything to do with implosions. Dark matter is doesn't grind anything since the main property of Dark matter is that it doesn't interact with regular matter. In all likelihood, there are billions of rogue planets in the galaxy, and some are smaller, and some are Earth-sized and "rocky". They could have been formed around a star and then ejected. 

Stellarium is a free planetarium software, and it allows you view the position of stars in the sky at any date. Sirius and the Pleiades are actually rather close in the sky. On the line of Orion's belt, on opposite sides. So for much of the the winter months, both are visible in the sky. For example in mid-December, they will be visible at midnight, in south-western skies. At the time of writing (8th October) they will be visible in the early morning. It is a well known starscape, with Orion central, the Pleiades and the V of the Hyades on one side, and Sirus, scorching on the other. Of course, the Pleiades and Sirius are "fixed stars", so the separation between them doesn't change. There is no time when they approach each other. 

In all cases, the comet is lost, destroyed or deactivated. As comets have a short lifespan, they are rare. 

Schematic from the space telescope science institute. So the cameras on Hubble, and the cameras that will be placed on JWST are distant relations of commercial digital cameras. They have no lenses, can see in a wider range of frequencies. The camera and its housing are also about 2m wide. However, the basic technology of converting an image into a digital file is shared between commercial digital cameras and the HST 

There are a lot of stars [citation needed] and they are organised into catalogs by various organisations, well known catalogs include the UNSO catalog (produced by the united states Naval office) and the Guide Star Catalog (used by Hubble to accurately posistion itself) I think the best for you is the Hipparcos catalog of stars, as it can be browsed quite easily by spectral type.

The Sun's gravity extends infinitely, but eventually solar objects would be unstable due to the influence of other stars. The minor planet "Sedna" has an orbit which takes it nearly 1000 AU (0.016 light years) from the sun at its furthest point (but now it is a lot closer) It is also thought that billions of comets must orbit in the outer part of the solar system, out to 50000AU, or 0.8 light years, (or possibly further) forming the Oort Cloud. However, at such distances, they could not be directly observed. This marks the greatest distance at which orbiting solar system bodies can be found. 

Capture of any object is never common. A rogue planet that passes a star will be accelerated by the star's gravity, and provided that it doesn't hit anything will pass the star in a hyperbolic path. For capture to occur, the rogue planet has to lose momentum, and there are a few ways in which this can happen. The most general way is for the rogue planet to interact with one of the stars existing planets. If the rogue planet passes close one of the star's orbiting planets, it can interact gravitationally, and transfer momentum to the planet, and slow down in the process. This is rather like the reverse of a gravitational slingshot. It is also possible that a double planet can be captured, if one of the bodies transfers momentum to the other. One of the double planet will escape, the other is captured by the star's gravity. Capture of rogue planets is very rare. There is no evidence that it has occurred in our solar system (never in 4.7 billion years is a big Never) though some have speculated that Sedna might be a captured object. But we know that captures like this are possible, as Jupiter and Saturn have a collection of moons, some of which seem to have been captured from the asteroid belt. 

No. No such effect has been discovered. Gravity seems to be always attractive, never repulsive. Nor has a particle with negative mass ever been discovered. In particular, antimatter appears to have positive mass. It is not theoretically impossible, but a particle with negative mass would be very odd, as the faster it moved, the less momentum and energy it would have. 

Convert commments to community wiki This is a standard problem with using an arctan function (inverse tan function returns a value between -90 and +90). A lot of programming languages have two functions the simple one like you appear to have used and a more complex one that takes two parameters for when you are dividing (before the arctan function) as in this case. (This is described in further detail at ($URL$ In Java you can use you may need to add 360 if the angle returned is negative. An alternative is . This is equivalent in most cases but avoids an infinite term at the ecliptic poles, costing one more trig function call.
