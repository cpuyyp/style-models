In term of safety, I think signaling intention to turn would be a higher priority than signaling braking - the benefits of signaling braking are questionable as many have pointed out above, but turning left (in a right side driving country) or right (in a left side driving country) is an accident prone maneuver even when bicycles signal and move over to the left (right) in advance of turning. Because cars do not expect turn lights, turn lights are probably not a safe alternative to hand signaling. But because hand signaling requires a hand, it affects stability of riding - hence a good solution would be a third arm which popped out and had a light on the end. However, in my experience and in the area where I currently live, signaling often leads to cars accelerating dangerously to get around the bicycle before it turns, hence somewhat negating the safety benefits of turn signaling. 

Since the RAW is long term goal, you are talking about a long term training plan. You must enjoy it, and you must not burn out - in other words you need to incorporate training as part of a sustainable lifestyle. During the weekdays you will need to some training but probably don't have much time, it is an opportunity to do high intensity training, core training, etc., which offer great benefits without draining all your stored resources. Such training is very satisfying and enjoyable, you will be amazed to feel your strength increase so easily. On weekends is where you can concentrate on the long distance aspect, which is absolutely required, but only to the extent it does not burn you out. If you feel bonked, in pain, or sick, then call it quits for the day. To make it more fun, I recommend participating in brevets (Randonneurs USA: $URL$ which have events of various distances 200K, 300K, 400K, 600K, 1000K, and 1200K. These events are basically self supported, with some volunteer assistance, so they are very economical (low entry fees). The cutoff times are always lenient, so you have plenty of room to develop your ability at your own pace. Always a very friendly atmosphere. There are also centuries and double centuries, which are supported events with higher entry fees. Good luck! 

Work a bit on smaller bunny hops - maybe up and down a curb - until you can start to feel yourself landing with a bit less force or until you get a sense that you are anticipating the landing. It was easier for me to yank and jump higher, but it took a while for me to learn how to jump in such a way that I was landing more gracefully and not thrashing my bike, body and wrists. The finesse and feel takes longer but is worth it! Everything happens in such a short period of time it's a little tough but you'll start to feel what works and what doesn't. 

The Fuji VALite 1769 bicycle is a higher-end bike of its time and unless something really bad has happened to it, would definitely be worth getting parts repaired or replaced. 

Yes, I'd say there are structural reasons for those lines being roughly parallel and it is not arbitrary. (Though the usefulness of my answer depends a bit on my interpretation of your phrase "nearly so.") I think the similar angles of the tubes you mention has most to do with the strength of triangles and the design of the classic and ubiquitous "diamond" bike frame design which utilizes those triangles such that they accommodate the wheel size that is currently popular in a structurally sound configuration. The diamond frame also has some economy of materials - aiming to draw straight lines from point to point, creating those triangles efficiently. There is novelty and utility in other designs (step-through frames, folding bikes) but there are trade-offs and considerations that prevents the geometry choices from being arbitrary. 

Very generally: A wider tire can provide more suspension. When anyone asks me for recommendations on bicycles, I immediately encourage them to consider a bike with wider tires. 

Being rigid, stiff or having bad timing with any of that will cause harsher landings with or without a bike. Trials riders dropping from large heights extend the rear wheel and have that land first with their legs absorbing the landing with the front wheel landing a bit later. Trying to refine your technique with smaller jumps will help by focusing on the sequence of things to make you and your bike act like a big spring: 

I'd like to introduce another axis: Tire material. Soft grippy material vs. Hard less grippy material. The Soft grippy material has the advantages on grippiness, smoother riding, less rolling resistance, but has the disadvantages of getting more flats (for the same thickness of material) and of wearing out faster. The reason for getting more flats for the same thickness of material is that the less grippy tire is more likely to deflect a sharp object, and is harder to penetrate. Generally speaking, racing tires tend to use soft grippy material, and not much of it, to keep the tires light. Conversely, training tires tend to use the harder less grippy material, and lay it on thicker. Racing tires therefore grip better, are lighter, and ride smoother. The only problem is they wear out faster. If your are a light body weight short distance rider (going hard for an hour, say) riding on smoother roads that may be acceptable as you wear them out in 6 months. But if you are a heavy body weight rider doing a lot of long distance riding on rough roads, you may be wearing out those tires every month or two, and that gets expensive. An alternative is a grippy softer tire with thicker material. Maybe 100 grams heavier than a racing tire, but just as grippy and smooth and lasts twice as long. There are two very popular road tires which together I see on over half of all bikes around where in live in California where the roads are not smooth. One is the thicker soft grippy tire, one is the harder less-grippy tire. Both are made by the same company. (I won't mention the company or the tire names as I think that violates rules). I've used both, and harder tire lasts about twice as long. But I prefer the softer tire for comfort, and I believe it is faster as well. The only (semi-)competitive riding I do is long distance (generally over 100 miles). Yet another axis is the presence of a puncture resistant band built into the tire. There is a huge variation in effectiveness of these bands, but the really effective bands tend to make the ride very hard and increase rolling resistance. I've used a pair such "puncture-proof" tires for mixed terrain riding - only one puncture where a goats head came in from the side bypassing the band. Apart from that months without puncture, even though the rubber on the tires looked as though it had been attacked by a mountain lion - cuts and deep scratches everywhere. Nowadays there are also tubeless tires. But that's beyond the scope of my comment. 

Details: The front wheel repair (called "truing") should be around $20 plus another dollar or so to replace the broken spoke. While I haven't used hockey tape, others have had success with similar cloth tape as long as you're not buying extremely cheap stuff. You'll get more padding with standard synthetic handelbar tape (contains a bit of foam or synthetic cork) which starts around $8. By watching various youtube videos, you can wrap these yourself very easily. (Also, cheap cloth tape will be more messy and sticky and won't be as easy to unwrap and start over.) A reputable, friendly, quality bike shop will help you get your bike in safe, rideable shape for the least amount of money possible. Insist on the bare essentials for a safe ride, but listen to anything that they say is a true hazard. Technically, you can ride a bike frozen in a single usable gear, but a few affordable tweaks of the drivetrain and replaced cables can mean riding a bike that is much more enjoyable and capable of taking you anywhere you want to go. Given your bike and needs, a basic $50 tune up will get them to look at and repair the necessities which wouldn't include the wheel repair and handlebar tape mentioned above. Remind them you're on a budget and are going to try to do some improvements (handlebar tape) on your own. Showing this initiative sometimes helps. Be wary of anyone that steers you toward purchasing an entirely new bike. A good shop will have low-budget options and might even secretly do a few tweaks and fixes out of pride and a sense of responsibility to someone who is giving such a lovely old bike, new wings. 

Use masking tape to secure a ruler (meter/yard stick) such that you can determine a precise midpoint measurement at the center. Tie a length of string to this midpoint, and hang a weight at the end of the string. Place the drop bar, evenly, onto the edge of a leveled table or bench. Rotate the drop bar until the "plumb bob" you have created comes in contact with the center point of the stem clamp area of the handlebar. Mark with this location with a maker or pen in a location that you will be able to see near the opening of the stem clamp. 

You have a brand new wheelset which is within 0.05mm of true yet has wide variation in spoke tension. Because the wheel is true it probably means that when the wheel was built attention was not paid to balancing the spoke tensions. That is a sign of low quality wheel building. Tension among all spokes should be +/- 5%. Or course on the rear wheel the DS and NDS may use different tensions, as much as 40% difference. You should at least take it back to your point of purchase and see what they have to say. Finally this year I tired of constantly truing my 16/24 bladed spoke lightweight wheels, and purchased 32/32 round spoke medium weight wheels with Velocity A23 rims from a local wheel builder who offered a lifetime guarantee of wheel tuning. Nice - the spokes all came with balanced tension, and the wheels are solid meaning I never have to true them - except when I ran into a crevice, scraping the rims and flatting a tire. Still, barely out of alignment, but the wheel builder tuned it up anyway - nice guy. Much better than dealing with a faceless company. And oh yeah - these reliable wheels were one half what I paid for the unreliable ones. 

The seals will age over time, and air will leak in. Surprised (but not so much) that your LBS didn't suggest you have the seals replaced the second time you showed up. Undoubtedly available on Amazon. 

I'm looking at the Hayes manual $URL$ for "how to mount caliper to fork". Oddly, it doesn't seem to specify how the pad offsets should be set, so that may explain why you have ended up with the outer pad all the way out. I suggest this: Wind inner and out all the way out. Mount with adjustment bolts loose. Turn inner pad 2/16 in, outer pad 1/16 in repeatedly until wheel doesn't move (it is just braked - not too tight). Tighten the bolts. Turn inner pad 2/16 out, outer pad 1/16 out repeatedly until contact noise stops. If it still is not well aligned (can't get rid of contact noise), compress the brake level with a strap to brake lock the wheel, then loosen the adjustment bolts and then tighten them again. I had a lot of trouble getting used to adjusting my mechanical Avid brakes, but now it goes very smoothly. Now I just adjust the pad offset slightly once every ten hours of riding, to take out the slack. 

You may want to considered a hybrid system that utilizes a battery store that the generator feeds into so you can work within the limitations of the hub generator, but supplement it with additional battery light(s). Generally, this sort of thing is for recharging gadgets and not necessarily running additional lights. $URL$ I'm certain there are electrical experts that could answer if the hub is just a trickle charger for a battery during daylight hours or what the limitations of such a system are based on voltage/amperage/ohms requirements for the various devices. There's also probably some concern around how the battery lights connect to the system. More of an alterative to investigate instead of a clear answer. 

Tire width has a large impact on bike performance but should be considered alongside tire qualities such as suppleness and proper inflation. 

I like my Spin Doctor Pro G3 due to the stable tripod base that works well inside and out on a variety of surfaces. Though it might not be necessary for some, I like that I can swivel the bike around the main vertical post to reposition my working angle on the bike (sometimes I'm on a stool). I don't think it's as easy or even possible to do that with some of the bipodal stands. Some people do not like the spinning knob used to operate the clamp. I find that it allows a nice sense of how tight I'm clamping various bike tubes as I close it. When I'm forced to clamp a thin tube on a road bike frame, I'm not quite as paranoid that I'm going to scratch or dent it. I'm also less likely to hold the frame tube at a bad angle and slam a clamp closed onto it because of the gradual but still quick and easy process. 

All that said, most modern bars have some visible demarcations on either side of the clamp area that makes eyeballing and/or measuring to the left and right of the stem pretty easy, without all this silliness.
