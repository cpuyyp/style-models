he didn't prohibit it for secular people, it's not even subsumed under sexual misconduct but since it's a lustful urge and act it is unwholesome and unskillful, and those need to be handled using the Right effort 

Anicca sutta (SN 22.45) an aspirant needs to go through a series of stages of mind development to arrive at that destination and those cannot be bypassed the first step in curing an illness is its acknowledgement 

to answer and accept an answer to this question we first have to predicate that the Buddha was an arahant, that is 

But that's the whole point. So if you already don't mind dying (that's how i understand your statement), then maybe you're an arahant? I of course am not familiar with your background, but whether you mind or not can be found out in the life and death situation, when contingency of dying is very real. Good health and safe environment are not the conditions to help to realize one's own mortality. An event which has a potential of causing a profound shift in one's attitude towards death is a death of a close relative, and especially a sudden and unexpected one, because it hits very close to home and with great impact due to suddenness. Contemplation of death for development of samvega is described in Maranasati suttas 1 & 2 $URL$ $URL$ And here's how actual practice of perception of death is described in a Gandhari Samyukta Agama Sanna sutra (Andrew Glass, Mark Allon, 'Four Gāndhārī Saṃyuktāgama Sūtras: Senior Kharoṣṭhī Fragment 5') 

Just to complement Chris' response, the sutta which i think is the final authority with regard to Buddha's position on meat consumption is Jivaka sutta (MN 55) 

with dukkha easily: everyone is subject to dukkha and so it's only natural that one would sympathize with them being in the same boat 

the fact that you (and all of us) are susceptible to other people's opinions is due to our ego, the sense of precious self in this respect development of understanding of anatta is a useful strategy and an excellent advice is given in the Ā­ghātapa­ṭi­vinaya­ sutta 2 (AN 5.162) of only attending to pure qualities of a person 

i do agree with it i don't agree however with the initial supposition, rejoice in the happiness of other beings is still Dhamma (i prefer it over the term 'Buddhism'), so one needs it at all times 

i find this an interesting question, my guess is 'NO', but i'm not sure i can explain why i think so and can't remember suttas which explain this point. that's as far as awakening is concerned as for nibbana i'm a bit more certain, just as suffering is effected by a chain of causes, quoted above, so is nibbana, for example 

i think in the worldly life the quality of the set goals is what counts, meaning that the results from achievement of that goal and accomplishments must be wholesome and beneficial objectively and not only gratifying one's ego if the goal is striven for, for the sake of self-satisfaction only, as normally is the case with sensual pleasures, it's not noble please consider 

according to the early Buddhism doctrine codified in the four Nikayas of the Pali and Agamas of the Chinese Tipitakas that is impossible realization of nibbana is necessarily accompanied by the knowledge of destruction of taints or knowledge of liberation 

here's a precise link to relevant portion of the MN 36 $URL$ the discovery of the middle way is not only manifested in the decision to resume eating and stop tormenting the body because austerities impede entering the jhana, but primarily in my opinion in the actual realization that the pleasure of jhanas is permissible and desirable because it's not sensual, only then came the understanding of incompatibility of severe asceticism with jhanas this positions the Dhamma halfway between the practices of ascetics who avoided any kind of pleasure, being of the opinion that pleasure in future lives, or even liberation, is secured with suffering in this life (like the jains), and indulgence in low carnal sensuality 

if we talk Buddhadhamma there should be no unrealistic expectations, since qualities of an awakened state are pretty much known in advance being described in the Buddhist scriptures besides, one cannot know for certain that the said teacher was indeed 'enlightened', especially considering his obvious attachmment to the way his teaching is treated and propensity to anger, and so adducing him for the argument in favor of an alternative form of 'enlightened' demeanor could be misleading and not necessarily convincing 

as a Buddha he could do nothing BUT good, because with awakened beings virtue and skill are natural, it's like a compass hand which points at only one directon Doubt is one of 10 fetters, which is abandoned at as early as the sotapanna stage not to speak of the arahantship 

Yodhajiva sutta (SN 42.3) one who is a Buddhist serving in a military during peace time with intent to slack on his duty at the high noon in favor of his obligations as a Buddhist, i think would be committing verbal misconduct of lying Here's how Ajahn Sucitto of Cittaviveka Vihara describes his encounter with road bandits while on a pilgrimage in India 

In the teaching of the Buddha consciousness and mind aren't strictly distingushed, mind (mano) is subsumed under consciousness (vinnana) which constitutes one of 5 aggregates (khandhas, processes which comprise the entire human experience) An act of cognition is performed by consciousness being conditioned by contact (phassa) of the 5 senses with the phenomena or of the mind with ideas. There's no necessity in existence of a permanent independent entity for the act of cognition. 

being mindful means to at all times observe oneself in order to discern arising of unwholesome qualities and preferably nip them in the bud or, if they through one's mindlessness have managed to develop into full scale ideas, bodily and verbal acts - engender intention and resolve to refrain from them in the future example: your co-worker receives bonus to his salary and you don't. a tide of jealousy starts building up inside your heart, then it reaches the point when you feel urge on this account to deliver sarcastic remarks at his expense and you do so, or you turn passive-aggressive and make ironical remarks about your own ostensible lack of merit. from unwholesome mental act to unwholesome verbal act: harsh speech in the first case and idle chatter - in the second this is a snowball of unwholesomeness: from emotion/idea, to act of speech and to a possible act of body now when you are mindful A. the moment you start feeling jealous, you notice, acknowledge this and restrain yourself to inhibit jelousy's further growth and try to evoke an antidote quality, which in this case would be mudita or appreciative joy/cheerfulness towards that person B. if you allowed jealousy to grow nonetheless, you acknowledge its presence, refrain from acts of speech and body driven by it and still try to replace it with an antidote quality C. if you gave in to jealousy and, being driven by it, spoke or acted spitefully, you acknowledge the wrong-doing, repent, make resolve to not behave this way in the future, and in the future you recall this resolve of yours in similar circumstances you also make a mental note to start developing an antidote, a wholesome oppostite quality in the Vitakkasanthana sutta (MN 20) the Buddha advises on several strategies for warding off unwholesome thoughts and urges, and although they seem to be intended for a meditator, they can be applied to routine mental activity as well same with the wholesome qualities only with the opposite sign: you notice when it's lacking, try to galvanize it inside your heart right then and there or make a resolve to have more of it in the future and when you do possess a certain wholesome quality, you notice this fact and make an effort to not lose it, and enhance and develop it further the Teaching of the Buddha is moral and ethical in nature first and foremost, where the object of mindfulness is practitioner's own behavior and psychic activity Mindfulness is not an end but only a means of virtue cultivation. 

so in continuation of Buddha's line of exhortation it can be said that when a person is endowed with the 10 courses of skillful action, then if they don't worship idols, they're pure, and if they do worship idols they're still pure. 

Sutava sutta (AN 9.7) So, being an arahant the Buddha could not tell lies when preaching the Dhamma and addressing questions, because all that he did consciously and if we accept that the Buddha's realization is genuine and his own knowledge is truthful, so he himself wasn't deluded, then his Dhamma must be as truthful 

there's an alternative point of view suggesting that if the Mahapajapati's story is indeed authentic, it postdates the first acceptance of a woman into the Sangha, who could be Bhadda Kundalakesa, and that reluctance of the Buddha concerns specific circumstances of that particular episode and not wholesale refusal of women entrance into the order the issue is dealt with at length in the Ven Sujato's book "WHITE BONES RED ROT BLACK SNAKES" (free) the history behind the issue appears very misty to me, where the truth probably won't ever be found out 

Maggavibhanga Sutta (SN 45.8) Four Right Exertions avoid situations and sensory stimuli which may provoke sexual desire, at that guarding of the sense doors is helpful when and if it still arises think of the drawbacks which giving in to the urge may bring, contemplate its impermanence, develop understanding that it's going to eventually subside anyway, so that it loses a degree of its attractiveness and immediacy 

one cannot experience dukkha objectively other than by way of indifferent perception of suffering of other beings experience is always personal and intimate, even when one perceives suffering of others one cannot appreciate it unless one identifies with them through empathy by mentally putting oneself in their shoes and finding out how YOU would feel so once one knows something as suffering it's invariably through the lense of one's own experience the goal to the best of my knowledge is cessation of suffering why is suffering bad? sounds like a profound question, answering offhand i'd say it's bad because in attempts to escape from it people act stupidly, hastily, irresponsibly, imprudently, making a mess out of this world 

please let me make a correction, in Theravada a term used to all who attain nibbana is arahant Buddha is one who only attained nibbana on their own having discovered the path to nibbana for themself without reliance on anyone else 

Alternative chronological order from Bimala Law: A History of Pali Literature, Ch 1, pp. 29-66 Chronological placement of the Octades (Atthakavagga) and Patimokkha, whole Nikayas, regarding their strata, is questionable, same for Sutta Nipata 

very wrong message, polite disagreement is completely normal try to overcome it by ceasing being meek and docile, because people are animals and take kindness for weakness, and then the following saying is at work
