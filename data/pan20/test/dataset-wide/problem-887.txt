This is a hard question to answer without hard numbers. When you look at this image, you can clearly see that the refractive power of the atmosphere changes as you look closer to the limb of Saturn. The rings start off being refracted slightly, then get more refracted as you get closer to the limb. That essentially implies the portion of the ring closer to the limb is traveling through lower and denser regions of Saturn's atmosphere and thus being refracted more. In that sense, there isn't a single answer here since there is a range of refraction going on. My first approach in considering this problem is to consider optical depth. In case you don't know what this is, optical depth, usually denoted by $\tau$, is a dimensionless number which is a measure of how much material light must pass through and interact with when traveling through a medium. The way optical depth is defined is such that a medium with $\tau\lt1$ means light can get through, while $\tau\gt1$ means light cannot get through. A more conceptual way of thinking about optical depth is to say that it represents, on average, how many atoms a particle of light will hit when trying to travel through a medium. That is, if $\tau=0.5$, then about half the light particles will hit something and be lost, while the other half will get through unscathed. If $\tau = 2$, then on average the light particles will hit two atoms and most light will be scattered/absorbed out of your line of sight, making you unable to see through that medium. A simplified definition of optical depth is given by $$\tau=\sigma N \ell$$ where $\sigma$ is the collision cross section of the atoms in the medium, in $m^2$, $N$ is the number density of atoms in the medium, in $m^{-3}$, and $\ell$ is the path length of light through that medium, in $m$. So let's finally take a look at your questions. 

I think the most important reason is that galaxy clusters more strongly adhere to the BAO shape than individual galaxies do. Galaxies tend to have more dispersion than clusters, making the BAO signal from galaxies smeared out and thus harder to detect. This is alluded to in the Veropalumbo et al. 2014 paper introduction. 

In the simple case of a single, non-rotating black hole, the physics is simple enough to actually do the calculations outright (albeit with some simplifying assumptions, e.g., the thin lens approximation). As described in the Lectures linked above: 

The first moon, you want to be as large as our current Moon in the sky and you say it has a physical radius of $R_{M1} = 1.1\:R_{M}$. Our current moon subtends about $30\:arcsec = 8.73\times10^{-3}\:rad$ on average. You can calculate the distance, $d_{M1}$, the moon must be from the planet to have the same apparent size as our moon with the following equation. $$d = \frac{R}{tan(\delta/2)}$$ Using $R_{M1}$ for $R$ and $8.73\times10^{-3}\:rad$ for $\delta$, your moon must be $d \approx 4\times10^8\:m = 44.5\:R_p$. Your first moon must be about 44.5 planetary radii out. Compare this to the Moon's distance of about 60 planetary radii out. Now, we want to know how long it would take for such a moon to orbit, given the planet's mass, the moon's mass, and orbital distance. You can get that from Kepler's third law. $$P = \sqrt{\frac{4\pi^2}{G(M_p + M_{M1})}d^3}$$ We can say $M_p = 3\:M_\oplus$ (as you specified) and we calculated $d$ just now. We only need to specify the mass of the moon. You provided the desired masses for your moons, so we're all set. Note $G = 6.67\times10^{-11} m^3kg^{-1}s^{-2}$ is the gravitational constant. I find that $P_{M1} = 1.44\times10^6\:s=16\:days$. Let's stop right here for a second now. We've reached a point where your numbers are in conflict. Given your planet and your first moon's apparent size, mass, and radius, we found that it would have to orbit the planet in 16 days. If you want to keep the 1:2:4 resonance, then you need your other moons to orbit in 32 and 64 days, respectively. I won't go through the rest of the math, I'll leave that up to you. But what you can do, if you want to ensure everything is consistent with real physics, is say I know how long my remaining two moons need to orbit for (i.e., you know $P$ for them), then at what distance must they orbit (i.e., what is the value of $d$ for them)? Work Kepler's third law backwards to get that. Then, given your desired apparent sizes in the sky, determine how large must they be physically by working the angular size equation backwards. You'll get new radii for the moon. You might then want to verify that the new mass and radii for your moons correspond to densities that match the desired moon types. E.g., if your third moon is going to be an ice moon, it should have a density of $\sim1\:g/cm^3$. You can play with your numbers until you get a system that matches your requires and fits the equations. An important note: All these equations use MKS units. That is, masses should be in kilograms ($kg$), distances and sizes in meters ($m$), time in seconds ($s$), and angles in radians ($rad$). 

In summation, two spinning black holes cannot merge into a black hole which is spinning faster than the maximal rotation. Gravitational waves and the linear momentum "kick" play an important part in helping binary black holes to lose spin energy, such that the merged black hole doesn't exceed a maximal rotation. I think the really interesting question that should be asked is, how do two black holes know, before merging, that their merger cannot happen as it would violate the cosmic censorship hypothesis? How do they know they need to radiate away extra energy before they can merge? What is the mechanism that prevents them from merging? Only time can tell for now. 

Anything larger wouldn't cut it in his simulations. His results only "looked" like galaxies in that they had spirals and similar shapes. They did not really exhibit the complex nature of the large variety of real galaxies. His spirals were a result of "winding" the matter as it spins. Scientists have long ago come upon the "winding problem" and know that arms in a spiral galaxy are not a result of winding matter but instead are density waves at the Lindblad resonances. 

The point of the two-point correlation function (pun not intended) is to describe how clustered the galaxies in the universe are. Astronomers want to know if they're all bunched up in tight bundles with huge voids, or maybe they're more or less uniformly distributed. The two-point correlation function is a way of measuring the distribution of these galaxies compared to a random distribution. In other words, if your distribution of galaxies is not uniformly random (which it isn't for our universe - our universe has a distinct non-random structure of clusters and voids) then your correlation function will indicate the degree to which it isn't random. Let's take a look at the last equation listed in your link. 

Radial Velocity Method - We can try to detect its gravitational effects on the star through a method known as the Radial Velocity method. Both the star and planet(s) will be orbiting their common center of mass. That means if we watch the star, we can see it orbit that center of mass as well. If we see the star "wobbling", we can infer what mass must exist in that system to cause the wobble. I should point out that we are only able to see radial wobbling (that is, wobbling of the star towards and away from us) which means that while we can still detect planets which are not directly aligned with the star as they would be for the transit method, they are much harder to detect. I also want to point out that the answer by choeger mentioned tidal forces, but that is actually not something we can use to detect planets or measure their effects on their host stars. Direct Observation - This is exactly what it sounds. With some clever techniques and the right conditions, we can take a picture of the planet itself. One pretty famous example was the direct imaging of Fomalhaut b. Shown below is an image over a few years as it travels through its orbit. 

The important point here is that an expanding universe (with no curvature) predicts this is the case, not that it actually is the case. His previous sections and accompanying plot indicate that observations show the universe is homogeneous. Hubble makes the point (and you reference it) that this is discrepancy can be solved by including the curvature of the universe into the mix as well in which case the predictions now match up with the basic "formula" which didn't include expansion or curvature. Just as an addendum, I'll expand on this and add that current observations do in fact show that galaxies are isotropic and homogeneous on large scales. One just survey showing this is the 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey. Shown below is a plot from their results. While full statistical analysis is needed to says something conclusive, you can see that to the naked eye, the galaxy distribution does appear to be homogeneous and isotropic. 

I might venture into some math which is slightly above what you need, but I wanted to show you the reason behind the correct equation to use. To start with, the pressure due to radiation, in the most general sense, is given by $$P_{\mathrm{absorption}} = \frac{\langle S\rangle}{c} \cos(\theta)$$ $$P_{\mathrm{reflection}} = 2\frac{\langle S\rangle}{c} \cos^2(\theta)$$ The top equation represents the case where some light hits your object and the light gets absorbed, and the bottom equation represents the case where light hits and bounces off your object (really it's re-emitted). Your case is the bottom equation so I'll work with that from now on and drop the reflection subscript. Without needing to explain exactly what it is, just accept that $\langle S\rangle$ is the average energy of the photon being absorbed or emitted. Now, that's for a single photon. If we have a lot of photons, generally the energy distribution of all the photons together is said to be described by some function, such as $I_\lambda$ (the subscript refers to wavelength). We can define the full pressure then by not only integrating over all wavelengths of all the photons, but importantly all the directions that the photons may hit or be emitted. $$P = \frac{2}{c}\int_0^\infty\int_0^{2\pi}\int_0^{\pi/2} I_\lambda(\lambda) \cos^2(\theta)\sin(\theta)\:d\theta\:d\phi\:d\lambda$$ Note now that we've replaced $\langle S\rangle$ with $I_\lambda(\lambda)$. Also, since we're assuming this is pressure on a flat surface, we're not integrating over every angle, but only half of them $-$ any photon, in order to hit the solar sail, has to come from the direction the sail is facing, and can only reflect in the direction it came from, i.e., we're discluding photons "behind" the sail. For that reason, the $d\theta$ integral only goes to $\pi/2$. If you don't understand the math at this point, that's fine but here's the important takeaway: If we only integrated over all wavelengths, you'd get the equation without the three that you listed. What that means is that the equation without the three doesn't take into account all the possible angles and orientations of the incoming photons. It simply assumes all your photons hit your surface perpendicularly, and then bounce off perpendicularly. This is of course not physically accurate as the photons can come in from a variety of angles. If you do the angle integrals out, you find that you get the following: $$P = \frac{2}{c}\int_0^{2\pi}\:d\phi \int_0^{\pi/2} \cos^2(\theta)\sin(\theta)\:d\theta\int_0^\infty I_\lambda(\lambda)\:d\lambda$$ $$P = \frac{2}{c}\frac{2\pi}{3}\int_0^\infty I_\lambda(\lambda)\:d\lambda$$ You can see there in the last line that the three popped out of those integrals over all the possible angles (specifically the $d\theta$ integral). Now, you get the rest of this by assuming some sort of function for $I_\lambda(\lambda)$ which describes the energy distribution of the photons as a function of wavelength. Since your light comes from a star, you know that's just going to be the Planck distribution (specifically the equation for $B_\lambda(\lambda,T)$). This integral is non-trivial, but if you again run through the math, you find $$P = \frac{2}{c}\frac{2\pi}{3}\int_0^\infty \frac{2hc^2}{\lambda^5}\frac{1}{e^{hc/\lambda k_BT}-1}\:d\lambda = \frac{2}{c}\frac{2\pi}{3}\frac{\sigma T^4}{\pi}$$ $$\boxed{P = \frac{4\sigma T^4}{3c}}$$ This is the true equation for radiation pressure on the solar sail, assuming reflection is occurring. This includes the three because we need to account for the photons hitting and bouncing off at all possible angles (for the solar sail). Note one important differences here is that my equation already has the extra "2" due to reflection factored in. Your last equation differs from mine in that it throws in that extra "2" for reflection. So either it erroneously included the factor of "2" twice, or (more likely) its account for reflection at every angle, not just all possible angles. Remember above, we only integrated the $d\theta$ angle up to $\pi/2$ for the reason explained there. If we integrated up to $\pi$ to include every angle, then we'd get an extra "2" as well and my equation would match your last one. Your solar sails though, don't receive or re-emit photons at every angle, and so my equation differs by that factor of "2". 

Phiteros' answer is spot on. We believe it is space that is expanding since the alternative has a near zero chance of being true. But I wanted to provide another, related piece of the puzzle $-$ The Cosmological Principle. This is notion that 

Because mass is positive To expand your quote concerning the gravitational force into an equation: $$F_G = -\frac{Gm_1m_2}{r^2}$$ The force of gravity, $F_G$ is proportional to the product of the masses and inversely proportional to the distance, $r$, squared. Let's break this down and see what might cause $F_G$ to be positive. In this equation, $r$ cannot be negative because it's a distance between two locations. Two locations cannot be a negative distance apart. And even if they somehow were, the squared would take care of that anyway. $G$ is the universal constant and always positive. You might argue that it could possibly be negative, but that's not possible. $G$ actually doesn't really exist. It doesn't describe anything fundamental to the physics of the universe. $G$ is simply a bookkeeping constant that allows us to get the right answer for the force based on any choice of units for mass and distance. Technically, if one uses the "correct" units for mass and distance (e.g., the Planck units), then $G=1$ and effectively doesn't exist. Since $G$ is just a scaling factor that depends on the choice of units, it will only be a positive number. That leaves us with the masses. These are the only things which could possibly be negative. Of course, to get a positive, repulsive force, one mass would have to be positive and the other negative. But what exactly is a negative mass? Mass is the metric which describes "how much" of something there is. How can you have less than nothing of something? Why can mass not be negative? If you want to look at this another way, you can show that if mass could be negative, you'd get nonsensical results! Assuming of course, all other aspects of physics were the same. Recall from Newton's second law that $$F = ma$$ Let's say there are two blocks sitting on a table. One block has a mass $m_1>0$ which is positive and the other has a mass $m_2<0$ which is negative. Ignore all other forces on these two blocks for the moment. I go up to $m_1$ and I apply a force to push this mass forward. The acceleration that is induced is: $a = F/m_1$. Necessarily, the direction in which $m_1$ moves is the same direction in which I'm pushing. That's all well and good. Now I go over to $m_2$ and I apply the same force, attempting to push it forward on the table. The acceleration induced on $m_2$ will be: $a = -F/|m_2|$. Note I made $m_2$ positive and pulled out the negative sign. You can see that if my force is forward, the direction the mass moves will be backwards! But here's the problem, my hand is in the way because it's trying to push to mass. As the mass tries to move backwards into my hand, it will be applying a force back on my hand, which by Newton's third law, necessarily mean's my hand is applying more force on the block, which then applies more force on my hand, ... and suddenly infinite forces are being applied or equivalently, these objects are infinitely accelerating. This is described by the concept of Runaway Motion. If this seems strange to you, that's because it is. If negative masses existed, we'd live in a very weird universe. Fortunately, we live in a universe where physics makes sense, mass is positive, and by extension gravity is always attractive.
