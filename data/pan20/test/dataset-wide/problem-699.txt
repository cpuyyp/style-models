I think you need to find a new shop. Your typical Velox rim strip should last on the order of decades unless a spoke goes through them or something (and that should be fixed, not just putting a new rim strip), so I'm not sure why it was replaced (or if it was done properly -- right size tape, covering all the spoke holes, aligned with the valve hole which is clean). The tube size shouldn't be a problem. My suspicion is that you're not running high enough pressure, or aren't installing the tube properly (having the valve free and straight). I'm not sure why the shop owner didn't put a 25c tube in though, considering they're probably the most common size to have on hand. As for tire wear, using brakes rather than skid stopping reduces tire wear. But, increased tire wear does come with the fixie territory, I suppose. Skidding wears the tire unequally depending on the chainring and cog size. 

The first thing to do with any rear derailleur problem is to check if its bent. If it is bent, go to your LBS and see if it can be unbent (there is a special tool for checking unbent-ness, Park Tool DAG-2 or similar) -- bent derailleurs cannot be adjusted properly in most cases (and even a minor spill can cause a bent derailleur). If its not bent, then try adjusting it. If you can't reach the smallest cog with the cable released (assuming a typical non-rapid rise derailleur, i.e. one which goes to the smallest with no cable tension), it likely means your high limit screw is mis-adjusted (too tight). [Typically, the problem upshifting into the smallest cog is usually a bent derailleur/cable friction, but you should have eliminated those two options before you got to this]. Some good tutorials for adjusting derailleurs are Sheldon Brown and Park tool. 

A specialized bike shop is a good idea, but so are bike co-ops and related things. A dealer who specializes in used bikes is a good bet as well - it will be cheaper probably and they will probably have a selection of good commuters. 

How do I evaluate the value of a used bike? Well, the simple answer is a bike is worth as much as someone is willing to pay for it. As guidelines, a few websites may be useful: 

Another option is to throw the trombone and what not into a small trailer, such as one of those children's trailers like this (a cheap one will be about 150 bucks): or attach a regular bike trailer like the Surly Ted (about 700 bucks for this model, but there are cheaper ones): 

If it happened in a week, you should take the bike back to the shop you bought the bike from and get them to give you a new wheel (or at least fix the one you have) for free [generally, they should have you take the bike in for a service after ~30 days / 50 miles, whichever comes first, for free]. Any competent bike shop should be able to replace a few broken spokes or adjust a wheel. Good wheel builders are rare and expensive, and you also have to make sure the quality of wheel is worth being rebuilt if you're going to pay for their services (if its a cheap wheel or there has been damage, they may not be willing to reuse parts or will charge more than just getting a new wheel). Going to a good wheel builder is for people who need/want exacting properties of their wheel -- strength for touring, extra heavy people, etc. in many cases. That being said, I don't know any in London (and I'm not sure its within SE's format to ask that question). 

Short answer: Height does matter (in fact, there are multiple "heights" which you can find out about in the long answer's links), but there are a ton of other factors (e.g. top tube length which is probably more important). The bike's geometry is what determines how well it works for you. Long answer: What you need is a bike fit (which can be done at most bike shops). Proper bike fitting makes your power delivery good and avoids potential injuries / pain. The handlebars, brake hoods, stem length, saddle height, saddle width, possibly cranks (though unlikely unless you're on the extreme side of heights),etc. will be adjusted based on your proportions (primarily your inseam as well as your reach) provided the bike can be fit to you. This is highly dependent as well on your riding style (racers don't ride the same way people going on cross country tours do, typically) and feel. Height and inseam are not sufficient (hence why they publish a ton of measurements per bike). I personally prefer a larger size than most people with my height (though I have longer arms + inseam than most people of my height)... See the links below for more details. The most common mistake people make is putting the seat too low (which correspondingly screws up everything else), but you really should start with a bike fit (or if this isn't possible due to financial constraints or something, surveying videos on youtube or something (but I will not link any, since this should be done with a LBS, and test rides)). As the KOPS link below shows, these systems aren't used as an exact science, so the experience of the fitter helps a lot in getting a good fit (the numbers plugged into formulas aren't everything), and it may take a few tries to get something that really works for you. A good look on the problems with fit and why its left to the pros at your LBS is $URL$ As for what you read, it may have been KOPS: $URL$ There are multiple theories as to how you should setup your bike for "best" cycling. Once you get a fit, you'll end up tweaking it to better suit yourself and changing riding styles. Getting tired also depends on how fit you are, and how efficient you are in using your gears - if you start in top gear on a racing bike, chances are you're going to get tired really quickly if you're not pretty fit. It sounds like you have a single speed, which means you have to compromise on one gear for the whole range of riding you do (unless you fit something like a Surly Dingle), so you may need to pick a different gearing combo, though typically these are set with a decent gearing which isn't too hard to start and easy to cruise in (like a 42t/17t on the Surly Crosscheck SS). If you have a fixie, your legs are always moving, so in this case, you may want a flip flop hub which allows you to flip the wheel and let you freewheel a bit when you're tired. Having multiple speeds may help with tired-ness depending on the terrain (hills make you want multiple speeds). Getting a bike fit reduces the bike setup part of riding and makes your physical fitness the next problem (and possibly gearing). You may find that the particular bike you have cannot be tweaked to work with your riding needs! (For example, a lot of racing bikes don't work as tourers/commuters). 

I'd probably just wrap the thing in electric tape and call it a day though. If I continued to have problems, I'd go for liquid electric tape, then heat shrink+electric tape. Or, if you can't find liquid electric tape, clear nailpolish might work okay. 

Typically, the front brake is more important if not as important as the rear brake, so you'd be better off swapping to a front disc (plus, if you are buying genuine Avid BB7's, they're sold as a front and rear kit IIRC). If you don't have a disc ready wheelset, you just need to get a disc ready wheel set (the front wheel is relatively cheap compared to a rear wheel) - I don't really see the point of reusing a rim in this case, since it will likely not be cost effective [and I never approve of reusing spokes]. Also, check the condition of the levers and use new cables + cable housing when replacing the brake. Good luck! P.S. It is spelled "brake", not "break". (Note that this will all be significant in cost relative to putting on a new V-brake (Avid Single Digit 5's are under 20 dollars a piece. If you put in a new FR-5 lever and new cable housing and cable, you'll still be under 40 dollars - this may be a better option if you were satisfied with v-brake performance [obviously, you can opt for better V-brakes, pads and levers for not much more, but the point still stands that a good V-brake is significantly cheaper than a disc conversion, and decent levers really aren't that expensive]. Make sure this replacement is economical on the bike you're using - in some cases, with cheaper disc-ready frames, you're actually better off selling the current bike and getting something with disc brakes on it already!) 

Yes - take off the tire and the tubeless valve, clean up the rim, put on some new rim tape and then install a tube + tire. If you're running tubeless and you have a failure, you can always just pop a tube in and continue your ride. And tubeless has its advantages (lower pressures since you can avoid pinch flats), so you may want to embrace it. 

Assuming you can get the bottom bracket out (this may be non-trivial), Velo Orange among other companies make "universal bottom brackets". To quote Velo Orange: "Grand Cru threadless bottom brackets fit most frames, even those with Swiss threading. And they work on frames with damaged BB shells, even if the existing threading is totally stripped. Unlike previous attempts at threadless BBs, this new design is "internally expanding". As the adjustable cup is tightened, the silver sleeve (see photo) is pushed up the tapered alloy cups, expanding and locking in the BB. This differs from older designs, like the Mavic, that pressed in from the outside and would sometimes slip. Installation requires only a traditional-style BB spanner or a pin wrench. The BB shell does not require chamfering or facing; simply slip the BB into the shell and tighten. It is easily removed and existing threads may be reused. Like the other Grand Cru BBs, these have sealed cartridge bearings, so they require no servicing and should have a very long life. Taper is JIS. So far, we have tried these on British, French, and Swiss BB shells and they work perfectly. Customers report that they also work in Raleigh frames with a 71mm wide BB shell. These BB's won't work on mountain bikes, as their standard width (73mm) is too wide for the shell to expand. They do not work on Italian threaded BB shells because those have a wider ID." Another thing to note is, if you can find the threading type, Phil Wood probably makes an appropriate bottom bracket for you. You'll likely be stuck with JIS for the crank, but theres plenty of new lower end cranksets or older higher end cranksets which use it. Note that Phil Wood is pricey, but if anyone makes the right BB cups and BB, it is them. Here is some information from Sheldon Brown on the case of vintage Raleighs - he notes that you can combine Phil Wood cups with a Shimano BB. A last dig option is to re-tap the threads for the bb to something modern, but this may be relatively difficult (and wont be super strong). 

To quote Park Tool: "Hold cogs in clockwise direction with sprocket chain whip tool. Turn remover counter-clockwise, using a large adjustable wrench, the hex end of another Park Tool sprocket chain whip tool SR-1, or the Park Tool freewheel wrench FRW-1. It will require force to remove the lockring. Expect to hear a loud clicking sound as the locking teeth of the lockring separate." Though I think actually doing the task enough times would instill it (kinda like how "righty tighty, lefty loosy" gets instilled in your mind eventually, without the little mnemonic). 

Aside from dampening it (foams) or switching to trainer specific tires (which will also last longer, like the Continental Hometrainer), the type of trainer plays a big part. You can have a fan, something thats magnetic , fluid, etc. - the fluid trainers tend to be quieter than the ones which are fans, for example. Even within the same class, some models may be quieter than others. So, you may be able to get quieter operation by appropriate trainer selection. 

$URL$ might be a useful link to start with - It says Anjou on it, so its reasonable to guess its a Peugeot Anjou of some year. In that link, they do link to some old Peugeot catalogues and what not (for example: $URL$ is a 1989 Peugeot Anjou). Depending on what parts of the bike are original, you may be able to figure out what year it is from the catalogues. 

In the US, you generally expect bicycles to get cheaper towards October/November, rather than May/June/July. Everyone wants to buy a bicycle when Spring gets nice and Summer. Then, they'll ride a few days in the fall and put the bike away in winter. So, sales tend to decline in the Fall/Winter (and the deals come out), so looking in Fall is probably the best. As for tricks to get bicycles at cheaper prices, you could look at shops in different areas which may have different costs (locally, some bikes here are more expensive than going to one of the cities a few hours away; however, some manufacturers may have price control) or look used (but it seems like you're looking at relatively high end bikes in this case, so you may not have as much luck with it). You may also get a good deal on accessories with a bicycle (a certain amount of free kit in some places), so you could hawk those on eBay or something to recover some money.
