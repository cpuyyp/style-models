Essentially, there is a balance of training stress and recovery that has to happen. The stress puts the muscles in a state where they will have priority when the body repairs itself. The recovery is where the actual growth occurs. 

The bottom line is for a home budget you have to get the most bang for your buck. I don't have any information on how often machines of a certain type break down, or typical repair costs. As to your friend's assertion that the magnetic resistance is better for your joints, I don't think that really applies for elliptical trainers. If your foot were coming off the machine and landing back down on it, there might be something to that claim. As to general guidelines for purchasing home gym equipment: 

So make sure you have enough protein in your diet to support working out. I was on a metered diet that was definitely low carb with a controlled amount of protein. The amount of protein was not sufficient to work out on as well. I started at 133Kg and lost 38Kg through diet alone. I'm now off the diet but want to lose another 9Kg. I'm doing that through exercise and eating a balanced meal. So your weight loss path will likely be different than mine. Anything you can do to increase the fat burning potential for your body the better. My recommendation is this: 

If your sticking point is above the knee, bands will provide the best training benefit. If your sticking point is somewhere to just below the knee to just above it, block pulls (deadlift on blocks so the bar is just below the sticking point or below the knee) will give you a better training benefit. If your sticking point is about mid-shin, hamstrings are probably the weak link and Romanian Deadlifts would be a better training benefit. If you simply can't get the bar off the floor, you probably don't have one area weaker than any other--you simply need to get stronger overall. As to deadlifting with just bands, Charles Atlas made a good amount of progress with similar dynamic tension movements. You would probably be better served by doing banded squats. The band would go under your foot, and loop around your shoulders while you are at the bottom. Then perform several squats. But even more, you would be best served by finding a local gym with daily or weekly rates while you are on travel. Or just take the time off. 

To answer that question it would require a long discussion about the pancreas, the colon, the kidneys, the liver and general digestion. I believe the thyroid also has a role to play. The one organ that is most involved with regulating the fat stores is the pancreas. When your body has a surplus of blood sugar, it secretes insulin which stores the excess sugars as fat. When your body has a deficit of blood sugar, it secretes glucogon which converts fat to blood sugar. The other organs help in various ways. Essentially the kidneys will dispose of the excess waste as urea (urine), and the colon disposes of the food that could not be digested as feces. For most people, if you reduce the frequency and/or intensity of insulin spikes we can not only limit how much we store as fat, but how much fat we can burn throughout the day. Some people have a misbehaving thyroid, which requires a different approach. A bit of warning though, don't blindly cut all carbs without consulting an expert to make sure you have sufficient nutrients in other areas. 

Now, Jim Stoppani's program isn't the only way to gain mass, but it addresses the needs of a beginner body builder and adapts as they grow. The truth is you won't be able to keep up with Phase 1 while you are using the weights you use in Phase 4. This is due to recovery needs. Your body needs to be able to rebuild itself into a stronger and bigger you after the stress of training. The other side of the coin is food The point of bodybuilding is to get bigger muscles, but stay lean enough that you can see them. You need to eat like a bodybuilder to see the improvements you want. It requires calories to build muscle, but you don't want to just blindly eat everything in sight. Another bodybuilding article on a mass building diet outlines what your diet should consist of: 

You could be experiencing gas escaping, or tendons popping in and out of place. See this everyday mystery about cracking joints. Due to the repetitive nature of this affliction you have, it very well may have to do with the tendons. I would recommend: 

Continue until you stall (i.e. can't get all 5 sets of 5 reps in). Deadlifts in the SL5x5 program are a little different than the others because you are starting at 1 set of 5 reps and you go up by 10lb each session. In short in every session you increase weight. There are other strength programs where you increase much slower, but those are designed for advanced lifters who have already maxed out the gains from the beginner programs (like SL 5x5). 

You'll note that there is no timeline on this curve, because that changes as you get stronger. As a beginner, those changes happened daily or every other day. As you progress those changes can be weekly, biweekly, monthly, or over the span of multiple months. However, the basic mechanisms are the same: 

Basic General Adaptation Syndrome (GAS Theory) from Hans Selye tells us that as our body is stressed in some way, it adapts to handle that stress. The basic principle works for getting stronger and for other stressors like getting sick. The process of adaptation requires energy in some form--and this includes immune system response. Now, if you have more than 20% body fat, your body will probably be OK pulling the reserves from your fat. People with less than 15% body fat will likely need to supplement with food. That only speaks toward energy. NOTE: if you want your body to pull from your fat stores minimize the amount of carbohydrates you have. Carbs cause an insulin response, which suppresses your body's ability to burn fat until the blood sugar is back to normal. That said, your body needs other things than just food. You may need to increase your micronutrients to provide the raw materials for your body to construct the antidote for your particular sickness. This is where extra Vitamin C, magnesium, zinc, etc. help fight off sickness. Typically this is done with vitamin supplements. Lastly, most of your recovery processes happen when you are asleep or at the very least in a state of relative rest. Two of the most important things you can do in recovering from sickness is stay hydrated and sleep. 

Performing over 100 reps with any weight is a grueling exercise in endurance, and is very difficult. However, that effort does not translate to increasing your ability to do work. I.e. getting stronger or improving your energy systems. Just as important: warmup should just be that. Getting your muscles warm enough to handle the work load. Performing massive sets with a weight only 2kg from the work weight is going to pre-fatigue the muscles so that you are robbing from what you can do at the work weight. 

In some cases, strains come from muscle imbalances or weakness, and in other case they can be related to technique. In either case, when you do strain a muscle the following protocol works well: 

You will see belts that are wider in the back, but they do not lend any more support. They also tend not to be as thick as belts that are made for performance such as what I described above. Before buying a belt, make sure of the following things: 

Everything depends on the coach; however, bad form will prevent you from lifting heavier weights. If anything, form is more important with power lifting where the goal is to have the highest total on the platform. That said, there is a decently wide range of what constitutes good form, and it comes down to finding a coach who can help you find your optimal form. When shopping for a coach consider the following:
