Ultimately, the ethical ramifications of revenge are a reflection of your personal moral code. However, if you even entertain thoughts of revenge, you might want to be careful about sharing them publicly, because most people will condemn you. 

I read an article about a nurse who worked with the dying. Over the years she heard many last regrets, and she eventually decided to write about them. She said the #1 complaint she heard was that people hadn't led a life true to themselves. For example, children dream of growing up to become astronauts, mountain climbers or ballerinas. But most instead wind up working on assembly lines or as checkout clerks in grocery stores. Is there a philosophical term for this situation? For example, "Sophie's dreams of being a ballerina ended with a dead-end job in a warehouse. She never achieved her ______." EDIT: I asked a rather confusing question. The answers have given me a lot of food for thought. In fact, I think I should have asked my question a different way. In particular, someone pointed out that we can't all be ballerinas (or the #1 mountain climber). This might be thought of as being true to yourself in an occupational sense. But think about all the people whose very minds appear to be "stuck in the matrix." It may be inevitable that they should wind up with a dead-end job, but most people won't even make the tiniest effort to change their lot. You might say they go through life as apathetic cowards. 

Imagine a situation where an evil person does an evil deed. I don't want to get distracted with a strawman argument regarding the definition of "evil." Let's say the deed consists of murder, which most of us would agree is not a good thing. You could also replace "evil" with "immoral" or "bad." A realistic example could be a world leader who decides to invade another country, then justifies it by claiming his country needs more living space or the other country did something bad (which it really didn't). Now imagine if the media began promoting both the act and actor as good. As a result, ordinary citizens begin to believe that their leader and nationalistic war are both good. What kind of fallacy is this? As discussed in my answer below, the answer appears to be righteousness fallacy. 

Great question! I up voted it because I've been pondering that myself. In fact, I think I asked a very similar question here not long ago. Anyway, I think it helps to think of them as a continuum. On the left, we have science, which deals primarily with a combination of hard facts (things that are easily observed or measured), logic and intelligent theory. The beauty of science is that scientists around the world can understand each other and typically come to agreement on most things. (Few scientists would question the existence of gravity, for example.) Next, we have philosophy, which focuses on things that can't be studied under a microscope. In the frequent absence of hard facts, logic becomes more important. Philosophy is much more divided than science, with noted philosophers sometimes seemingly polar opposites of each other. Religion, of course, is similar to philosophy in that it focuses largely on abstractions that can't be readily observed or measured. However, religion is very different because it replaces rational inquiry with dogma and blind faith. Some people would disagree with that statement. It largely depends on how one defines religions, plus no two religions are exactly the same. But I certainly wouldn't put Christianity or Judaism in the same category as philosophy or science. Like many people, I have greater respect for the so-called Eastern religions. I've been trying to plug other "cognitive spheres" into this equation, notably spirituality. Spirituality is hard to discuss because it may be even harder to define than religion. But here's the scheme I'm working with: 

Like not smoking? One could well argue that not smoking is a moral act, but linking it to Hitler or anyone else doesn't make much sense. It's a moral act all by itself. If 10,000 nuns smoked, not smoking would still be an intelligent (and quite possibly moral) choice. EDIT: To further put this question in perspective, just replace "Hitler" with the name of one of history's biggest monsters, like Caligula, Abraham Lincoln or Milton Friedman. Many people regard Lincoln as an all-American hero and might therefore appreciate using his image to promote drinking milk or whatever good things he did. However, Lincoln also presided over the biggest mass execution in American history and may not be too highly admired by Native Americans. 

Dr. A is a very evil man who harms millions of people in other countries. In fact, thousands or millions of people die each year because of him. Let's say he's a mad scientist who produces some fraudulent drug that kills people. Citizen B decides to put a stop to the madness and kills Dr. A. It isn't a revenge killing; he acts calmly and rationally. And there's no politics involved; they're both civilians. Are there any notable philosophers who would consider Citizen B just as evil or immoral as Dr. A? If so, what logic would they use to arrive at that conclusion? I should emphasize that I'm not interested in religious/theological opinions (e.g. "because the Bible says so"). I'm strictly interested in philosophical arguments that can be backed up with some kind of logic. NOTE: I just read the Absolute Ethics discussion. I'm not sure if it answers my question or not. It kind of sounds like a religious argument to me in that it appears to based more on faith than logic. It sounds like Immanuel Kant is a notable philosopher who might consider Citizen B just as evil as Dr. A, but I'm not sure about his logic. So I think I'll select leroy's response as the correct answer. To put it in better perspective, it sounds like this would be a better complete response: Notable philosophical doctrines that would treat Dr. A and Citizen B as equally evil are probably limited to "faith-based" paradigms - e.g. religion and, arguably, absolute ethics. 

Yes, it can be argued that socialism is a failure. Or it can be argued that it's a success. Ditto for capitalism. As Fidel Castro noted, “They talk about the failure of Socialism, but where is the success of Capitalism in Africa, Asia, or Latin America?” The first socialist state, of course, was the Soviet Union. Most of its excesses can be attributed to Joseph Stalin. Another early convert was China. Both of those countries had problems of such magnitude it seems a miracle they survived, regardless of what economic system they embraced. Socialist states in general have been routinely undermined and even destroyed by the West. Libya boasted the highest standard of living in Africa before it was invaded and destroyed by NATO. So your question is based on a premise that's very shaky at best. For argument's sake, suppose we could fairly judge socialism to be somehow worse than capitalism. That still doesn't make capitalism a wonderful thing. For many people around the world, the word "capitalism" has long been synonymous with "greed," "corruption" and "exploitation." I'm not sure if it is recorded in Che Guevara's famous Motorcycle Diaries, but in the movie there's a scene where Guevara is visiting with a couple miners in Chile. They're working under harsh conditions in a mine run by some U.S. corporation, and they're frightened because they're communists - a status that can get them killed. I recall Che Guevara referring to communism as a strange new thing that they didn't really understand. All they knew was that it offered an alternative to capitalism, which was killing them. I'm not saying Karl Marx' ideas were wonderful; I don't know. But even though he's often regarded as the father of communism, he wasn't really its creator. In summary, it's difficult determining what Karl Marx' legacy is, let alone whether it's good. Good or not, we have to remember that Marx died before the Bolshevik Revolution, so he didn't have much to say about how people interpreted his ideas. 

I just read that Mao Tse Tung ordered peasants to kill sparrows, which eat edible seeds. His intentions were good; he wanted more food available for people. However, after millions of sparrows were killed, the insects the sparrows ate exploded in population, ravaging crops. Millions of people starved. This illustrates the well known fact that things don't always go according to plan. Or are you asking about a good "thing" that's intentionally used to do evil? One example might be vaccines. Vaccines were originally invented as a way to promote human health. However, there are concerns about vaccines being used to sterilize people, and some worry they could even become an instrument of eugenics. You said you want to stick to "philosophical viewpoints," so I'm not sure if the practical examples I offered are what you're looking for.
