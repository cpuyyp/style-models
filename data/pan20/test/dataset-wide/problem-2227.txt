The line titled "Handicap" contains the difficulty ranking of each hole on the course as played from the Men's or Senior's tees (Blue through Gold on this card). Hole 8 is the most difficult; it's the longest par-4 on the course, requiring a long iron or wood shot from the fairway to make green in regulation (in turn requiring you to avoid the fairway bunkers), with water bordering the hole on the left side on approach. Hole 12 is the easiest; the second-shortest par 4, and with no water and minimal hazards (one approach bunker). The Ladies' tees are typically placed much closer to the hole, especially on longer par 4 and 5s, to compensate for reduced drive distance between men and women, and that can make certain holes easier than they would be from the Men's tees. So, the Ladies' tees have their own handicap ranking, seen on the line under the distances for the Red tees (traditionally the Ladies' tees). For ladies, Hole 7 is the hardest on this course, because it's the second-longest par-4 as played from the reds (and only by 7 yards), and has water (though easily avoided, unless the hole severely slopes toward the hazard). Hole 13 is the easiest; par 3, no hazards, and the distance is somewhere in the mid-irons for most women. So, assuming you and I are both male golfers playing the course this card is from, with the handicaps stated above, I would add one stroke to your score (or deduct one from mine) when we played holes 4, 7, 8, 9, 14, 17 and 18. Now, I may not need those handicap strokes on those holes. For instance, I may have it together on hole 8, and birdie with a strong drive, accurate long iron or fairway wood approach and a one-putt, while you either two-putt it for par or have to make an up-and-down with an extra fairway stroke, so I would have won the hole without the handicap. Meanwhile, back on hole 5, I hit one in the lake and double-bogied, but you three-putted to win by one stroke. In that situation (or any other), I can't apply my handicap stroke on 8 to hole 5 to halve the hole; I just have to take the loss of hole there and do better on the next few to make it back up. 

There are a few reasons. First, between 10-15 years after initial onset of puberty, the body goes through a "settling" phase; growth and sexual maturation is completed, so some of the hormones are dialed back. Metabolism slows, calories consumed more easily turn to fat, and the body generally "bulks". All of these are counterproductive to maintaining a peak level of performance in athletics. Phelps, when training, eats 11,000 calories a day, mostly complex carbs. Before the big slowdown, a lot of that is readily available as blood glycogen, but after the metabolism drops insulin more readily turns those blood sugars to fat. That makes between about 25 and 28 years of age a critical dropout range beyond which it is extremely difficult to maintain a high level of performance and nigh impossible to keep up with the younger whippersnappers coming in behind you. Second, swimming takes a LOT of time and effort. When training for the buildup to the Olympics, you're in the pool pretty much all day, cycling between endurance-building (long swims in a particular stroke; 1000m fly is a common torture technique), muscle development (sprint lengths; 50/100/200m going all-out), skills drills (starts, turns, arm/leg isolation of various strokes), and practice meets (some more "practice" than others). And this is year-round; you're still training in the winter months, usually working around school schedules, which in most US climates requires an indoor heated pool just to be possible. At some point, usually very soon after college age, it becomes impractical to keep up this pace from a time and money perspective. Third, competitive swimming in the United States is one of those sports we pay attention to once every four years, and even then only the real standouts become household names (and not for long). After you've won a few gold medals in the Olympics and the World Championships, and maybe set a world record or two, you've pretty much done all you can do in the sport, and it's time to go off and find something else to do with the rest of your life. Contrasting that, in the popular US spectator sports like football, basketball, even hockey, you can make millions of dollars years beyond your performance peak as a "franchise player", a household name that puts butts in seats to see you. 

Unassisted double plays are uncommon, but they happen. First or third baseman catches a low line drive and tags the runner who led off and/or took off thinking there was no way you'd make that catch. Second baseman catches a one-hopper between first and second near the baseline, tags the base runner leaving first and beats the batter. Shortstop does the same with the second and first-base runners. An unassisted triple play, however, seems impossible without a huge blunder on the part of multiple runners or the umpire, especially with the IFR. The only way I can think of that it would realistically happen without a major runner blunder is for the shortstop, positioned close to the baseline and near second, to catch a screaming one-hopper, tag the runner leaving second, tag second base forcing out the first-base runner, and then it's a footrace to first and the batter has a head start. The batter would have to be trotting to first for some reason (injured, older slugger). The only other scenario I can think of is similar, but involves a pop fly and a sleeping umpire. Batter pops the ball high and right to second base, umpire doesn't signal IFR but batter's sure he's out. Shortstop or 2B muffs the catch, picks the ball up, tags the second-base runner, tags second base, and races the batter to first. Wikipedia's possible scenario has the second baseman or shortstop standing between the second-base runner and second base itself, and the second-base runner would take pains to prevent that, because if the catcher saw that he'd signal the pitcher for an easy 2B pickoff. It also requires the first-base runner to not see the catch before committing to take second base. Either way, Wikipedia's scenario requires multiple baserunner mistakes on top of a perfectly-placed hit and baseman. Are there any other scenarios likely enough to be plausible in MLB? 

Ask 15 "average golfers", you'll get 16 answers. It all depends. From your article which Ed helpfully digested, the average American golfer plays 46 rounds a year. The average golfer also has a 15 handicap, which sounds like I might need to give it up. Of course I'm not average in many ways: 

Several reasons, basically along the lines of "you don't want the pitcher batting last in the 9th inning": 

The primary and overarching rule in any sports league is that the on-field staff is infallible. Even for booth reviews in football, the replay must show that the call was clearly wrong in order for it to be reversed (and that aspect of the ref's on-field ruling must be reversible; you can't, for instance, assert that a penalty should have been called when there wasn't one). That said, most major leagues have adopted some sort of "appeals process", both in game and after the game is over. In some cases, rulings can be overturned on appeal even after the game is over, but in most cases, the spirit of the game and the assumption that "the referee is always right" still prevails, and the overwhelming majority of protests are unsuccessful on those grounds. What a protest can change is the outlook of the officials. When shown that they made a bad call, officials learn from their mistakes even if there is no official action taken as a result of the protest. If the call was obvious enough and blown badly enough, the referee can be removed as incompetent and replaced for future games (I refer you to the Packers/Seahawks game and the controversial call that ended it; that was a major factor in getting the NFL owners to strike a deal with the officials' union and get the replacement officials off the field). 

The first thing you must understand is that a 210-yard drive that flies in the direction you want it to go is much preferred over a drive that would have gone 300 yards had it not taken that huge right turn in mid air and sailed out of bounds. A "grip it and rip it" mentality will be far more detrimental to your score than a shorter drive distance. Second, yes, the professional players have great drives. However, they "drive for show, and putt for dough". Tiger can hit an 8-iron 180 yards and can drive well over 300. He still takes his putter with him for the round (even when he leaves his driver behind). Given that you can put a drive, wood or long iron shot on the fairway, and have at least one club in your bag that can reach that par-3 green (most par-3s I've seen are in mid-iron range, with a couple 200-yarders requiring a wood shot; they don't tend to test the 240-yard upper limit of what you can call a par-3, at least not from the normal Men's tee box), it's the short game that determines your score for a hole; I've had beautiful tee shots ruined by skulling the approach chip shot, and made the green in regulation only to four-putt. The drive distance used as a benchmark for the USGA's hypothetical "scratch golfer" (and thus for determining the par of a hole and course difficulty ratings) is only 250 yards, so if you can drive that distance, you can achieve a zero handicap. More distance is always desirable (until you're carrying your drives over the green into a lake) but never at the expense of accuracy and control. Given that, 210 yards is more like a good 3-wood distance than a drive, and it's understandable that you would want to improve that (again, not by much). Here are some dos and don'ts:
