It just so happens that a Latin word *uncia (apparently unattested but noted by Meyer-Lübke) for "finger joint" is mentioned in Meillet and Walde. It is mentioned under and apparently derived from uncus, "curved". Perhaps the root *un(i)(c)- for "one" originated in this practice of counting by finger joint, where you have twelve finger joints in the right hand for the thumb to touch? Note that uncus is apparently related to unguis "claw" (v. Meillet) and to English ungulate, anchor, and angle (all from Latin), and to English "nail" (from Proto-Germanic, v. Walde). The Proto-Indo-European root was apparently something like *-nk-, "bend" (Oxford English Dictionary); in some languages, a "vulgar" vowel like u- was prefixed (Meillet: "populaire"), resulting in uncus etc. If a uncia is related to uncus, then the precursor of unus "one" must be derived from uncia; but then this must have happened before the Italic and Germanic branches of Proto-Indo-European diverged, since the Germanic languages also have words for "one" based on this Proto-Indo-European precursor of unus. It seems unlikely that both uncus and uncia survived through the Proto-Gallo-Italic phase into Latin for so long and made it unscathed, especially considering that unus would still have had to drop its -k- sound! Therefore, if uncia "1/12" should be related to uncus "curved", it would have to be unrelated to unus/one; but the relation between unus and uncia appears to be undisputed, so it seems that uncus and uncia are not related. Perhaps there was some sort of folk etymology at work in the archaic age, where speakers or writers mixed up some of those words and their etymologies? 

I agree with Microtherion (fantastic name, I love it!!): the things you are already doing are great, but reading is what seems to be lacking. I mostly learn(ed) English that way. Seeing a lot of words and constructions in context greatly helps you to polish/grow your intuition; and it is relatively easy to motivate oneself to read. You can learn to speak a language like an expert by speaking and listening alone, but then you'd probably need a lot of exposure. The great advantage of reading is that you can look things up and go over a sentence or paragraph multiple times, and at your leisure. I think newspaper or Internet articles about something that interests you are a good start. Do make sure the website sticks to conventional grammar. Another thing that can help is chat rooms. The problem is that you need to find a room with interesting people who are willing to talk extensively to someone who does not speak the language well yet, but it is possible. 

Another common way of forming the perfect stem is by removing the theme vowel (if present) and adding -u-. This is especially common for verbs of the -ē- conjugation, but by no means limited to it. 

However, in many cases the suffix -t- has to come immediately after a consonant; in that case, many things can happen. This is perhaps unexpectedly not limited to consonant stems. After p and c, it can come immediately after: 

So it was an idiomatic development in older Latin. Because uncia was mainly the smallest unit of weight in early Republican currency, perhaps the smallest unit was simply called "one-ness" or "unit". It just so happened that an uncia was taken as 1/12th of an as, which was the central coin of the new Roman system introduced ca. 280 BC and based on the older system of the aes grave ("signed bronze"), where one unit of aes grave equalled twelve unciae, small "pellets" of bronze. Note that the weight represented by the uncia was also an important quantity that was often used, so uncia and as were the two main coins, and also the smallest and the largest, respectively. As a unit of weight, uncia was also used outside coins. Coins like the denarius, worth ten asses, were only introduced later; the word de-n-arius simply means something like "tenner" (cf. English de-cimal). However, an uncia was also one twelfth of a pes, a foot, like the English word inch, no doubt related. I don't know whether the unit of length or the unit of weight (from which English ounce) was older, so I don't know which influenced which. 

Why is "copula" a useful category? First of all, because copulae generally behave differently from transitive verbs and verbs that take adverbs as secondary complements. Secondly, because subject complements used to be clearly marked as such by being in the nominative case when the precursors to modern English still used cases consistently; this makes it easier to maintain a consistent set of labels for the same construction through the ages. It is the same construction, because that man was I has not changed essentially between then and now: it is rather that the case endings of nouns were dropped gradually. So we would have to take an arbitrary point in time at which we suddenly start using a different label for this construction. In addition, the gender of the subject could be used to identify subject complements too, before endings were dropped. An adjective would agree with the gender of the subject if used as a subject complement. Thirdly, many foreign languages still have clearly marked cases or genders, like German, in which subject complements are easier to identify than in English. The construction and the criteria I set out above are the same. Should we then call the same construction by different names in different languages? That is possible, but it obscures interlingual connections, and I would prefer to do that only if we have a very pressing reason to do so. Fourthly, people have been using this label for ages: why change it now, and bother them to learn yet another term without a strong reason? 

This is from a Latin document presumably written in the 14th century. Consider the third, long letter. It looks a bit like a long, vertical, pointy semi-oval, with a short horizontal line across, and a diagonal thingy at the top right. When using a quill, a line drawn down is usually thicker than up. Looking at the thin left half of the oval (2), you will assume that the thick, right half of the oval (1) must have gone down, the left half up. Similarly, a line from left to right is thicker than one drawn toward the left. The short, thick, diagonal line at the top (3) must have been drawn downward and to the right. This means that the main vertical line and the short diagonal line must have been drawn in separate strokes. As to the horizontal line (4), where a short horizontal line crosses a long vertical line, we usually draw the vertical line first, as in our modern letters t and f. So he must have begun at the top, drawn the vertical line downwards, and up again to the left, touching the starting point and closing the oval. Then he either lifted his quill, or he continued to draw the "flag", the thick diagonal line that goes from the top downwards to the right. Then he raised his quill to draw the horizontal line from left to right, continuing on into the next letter. One usually begins a stroke with an important part of a letter, whereas a decorative or connecting flourish is more likely to occur at the end of a stroke. All this taken together leads to the conclusion that this letter must be an f, and the word Infinita. 

As an alternative, it is possible that ja, ja originates in a polite phrase that no-one believes any more (instead of a faded ironic phrase). The fact that doubling a negative gives a positive is inherent in negations, because they invert whatever falls under their scope. Positives do not invert; they do not change what falls under their scope like that. Then again, who is to say what counts? Depending on one's definition, it could be argued that there are two positives, and that the whole is negative. I suppose it is a trivial matter at any rate. 

This sentence can be read in two ways; one is similar to the same sentence but in the third person or in the past: the utterance you were dismissed simply describes a situation where you were dismissed, but it is not a declaration. In that line of thought, you are dismissed could be read as a non-declarative description. The other reading is performative: by saying this, I affect the external world in such a way that the description becomes true and you are indeed dismissed. When both readings coincide, it is a declaration. You cannot remain undismissed after my utterance: there is a direct causal link. This is essential. From that it follows that a declaration must describe an utterance (among other things), or there cannot be an inescapable causal link. And so it must normally contain some verbal phrase that expresses an utterance. Note that the question who is to assign this truth value (you? I? someone else?) is open. An explicit declaration is one that is self descriptive, in that the descriptive aspect of the utterance as a whole accurately describes the performative utterance. In you are dismissed, this is not the case, because you are x does not describe an utterance at all; it is therefore considered implicit. The word dismissed does describe an utterance, in that dismissing someone is uttering certain words, but dismissed is not the whole utterance. 

Here the subject of conquer is the only Frenchmen; in a good computer to buy, the preceding noun phrase is the object. That is what makes this (albeit common) use of the attributive infinitive special. It seems the relation between the noun and the infinitive is better considered [noun]—[postpositional adjective] than [object]—[governing verb], although functionally it is both: if one treats it as a postpositional adjective, the word order makes sense, which it does not if you look at it as subject and verb. 

What are performative verbs and declarations? There is much confusion about what performatives and declarations are and how they should be classified. The following definition by Searle seems the most useful and exact one: 

This is could be read as a declaration, if by being out you mean the registered statistic in the game. That is also how the umpire means it, so from his perspective it is a declaration. However, if you read it as being at the designated position at that exact time, it is possible that the umpire was wrong: you can then say the umpire said "you're out!", but he was in fact not out. Here the question 'who is to judge the truth value?' becomes very relevant, and this goes beyond my answer. It is not explicit, however, because being out does not describe an utterance, and therefore it cannot describe itself. There is no verbal expression of utterance, as in I declare you out. 

The (unattested) Latin form was *habibilis, as mentioned by Sihler and noted by Tom Recht below. In classical Latin, this had been shortened to habilis, as it often happens with double syllables (called haplology). The h- had disappeared in certain French forms and dialects by the time the word was borrowed by English, and -lis regularly evolved into -le in French, resulting in English acquiring the word able. 

As to modern handwriting, the same techniques mostly apply. The only problem is that there is even less uniformity now than in the Middle Ages, when a scribe would at least follow some local scribal tradition. The same applies to your question why some people can read a certain manuscript while others cannot: they may be more used to a certain style, they might have more information about the background of the person who wrote it, or they might just be more talented. An important approach to a cursive hand that is difficult to read is to follow the ink (or other pigment) in chronological order. That is, when looking at a letter or character, one tries to determine where the scribe first touched the paper (or parchment, papyrus, wax, clay, wood...), which line or curve was drawn first, which next, which last. Doing so consciously can sometimes be just enough to realise what the scribe was doing. 

"Carthage must be destroyed." I'm wondering about the infinitive (ser): where does it come from? In what situations is the infinitive used after que: only with ter + que, or also with other verbs? It looks strange to me, because I don't know of any similar construction in the other Romance languages. But it is not at all unlikely that I missed parallels: does a similar construction exist in any of them? I know it doesn't exist in Latin: so in what way could it have developed from Latin constructions? Is it perhaps a combination of quod and the accusative with infinitive? I would appreciate any information that could help me put this construction in a broader perspective. 

The word sea/zee/See comes from Proto-Germanic *saiwi-z, "sea/swamp/lake?", Gothic **saiwi-*, "sea, marsh, lake"; it is uncertain where this stem came from. Some suggest it might have come from Proto-Indo-European **sai-*, "sorrow, sore" (Pokorny). In any case, it appears there is no clear boundary between sea and lake in this root either. From Kluge's Etymologisches Wörterbuch der deutschen Sprache: 

An different but interesting development in French is that of the word quoique, "what which", similar to Latin quidquid. It can mean "whatever"; but it has also developed a meaning "however", and even "although", as a full conjunction. That is, there is no longer a "what" to fulfil the function of a subject or object in the subordinate clause. La Harpe to Voltaire (s.xviii): 

As these terms originate in Indo-European grammar, I will focus on Indo-European languages; these names may not apply as well to non-Indo-European languages. 

Indefinite relative clauses seem to be intimately connected with a concessive ("although") connotation in many languages. 

Traditionally, 1 and 2 are known as verbs with object complements. A number of verbs can have those; they are similar to how copulae can have subject complements in that they either identify the object with its complement (I consider him my best friend) or assign/apply a property to it (I consider him dull), just as copulae do this with a subject and its complement. Other examples: 

Apparently stront comes from a Proto-Germanic root *strentan-/*stranta(n)-/*strant(i)ō(n)-, which meant "something long and stiff", after what the Etymologisch Woordenboek van het Nederlands calls "the shape of solid excrement". The EWN also notes that Latin borrowed it as strundius, which is attested in the 9th century. As you say in your comment based on Italian Wiktionary, Italian got stronzo from Lombardic strunz. The Lombards were a Germanic tribe that invaded Italy in the 6th century and settled there, giving modern Lombardy its name; so it makes sense that they should use the Germanic word (Middle German strunze meant "stront"). But Wiktionary also mentions Italian/Lombard sterco, which must come from Latin stercus "dung", related to Greek skôr, stem skat- "dung", as in scatological. So perhaps the Italian word is a fusion of the Germanic word and the Latin word? The EWN says stront is related to stronk "tree trunk" and Proto-Indo-European *stred- / *stredh-, which in turn may be an extension of *(s)ter(h1)- "be or become stiff". Which happens to resemble Latin stercus. 

Ja, ja in Dutch and German can express disbelief too. But I don't think ja, ja, да, да, yeah yeah, or yeah, right should really count; they do not express a double positive in the sense that one positive modifies the other or that both modify the same thing. They are just strong (because repeated) positives used ironically; they indicate disbelief—but is it an actual negation? You could use any locution to express a negative illocution: 

The German branch (English, German, etc.) and the Italic branch (Latin, Spanish, Italian, etc.) of the Indo-European languages each split off from Proto-Indo-European, their common ancestor. This probably happened There is no other relation between the two branches (except reciprocal borrowings and influence). Both come/come and how come from the same Proto-Indo-European root (probably something like **kʷo-*, ), but they went through different phonological changes in the mean time, so they look very different now. Spanish and Italian split off from their common ancestor Latin a short time ago, no more than, say, 1500 years ago, so they still look very much alike. There was also much contact between them, and hence more borrowings and mutual influence. This does not apply to the Germanic and Italic branches of Proto-Indo-European, whose oldest common ancestor existed over 5000 years ago; and the two branches generally didn't undergo much reciprocal influence either. 

Conclusion: A. It is easier to learn skills associated with producing language by immersion than by other means, but you can still learn them; B. Immersion is not enough for other skills, such as educated reading and writing. C. It greatly depends on the person. Immersion should be considered an important and efficient tool, but it is neither absolutely essential nor always sufficient. The best and quickest way to learn a language and all its facets is by a combination of reading, writing, and immersion (so speaking and listening). Reading includes both novels and grammar books. Chatting on-line has some of the important aspects of immersion, but it is of course confined to writing.
