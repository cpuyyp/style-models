So I participate in a road bike race at the end of the month, and due to the cold weather and general winter laziness I didn't bike a lot. I know that I can do the distance in theory; I've done a race of comparable distance, but a lot less elevation gain, last year. There is a maximum time for completion, too. 

I wonder about the differences between running on a track and running cross country. I know that it is very dependant on the condition of the x-country course, but I did some research and failed to find comparable times and distances. I also ask myself if it is healthier or worse to run cross country instead of running on the road. So, are there benefits to running cross country and how much more time should I expect to be needing for the same distance? 

Although I had to completely rewrite my answer, my main point is still valid. But I have to modify it a bit: What most of the fitness sites tell you is still crap. They give you a checklist and you have to check for certain features, and then they put you inside one class and make you believe that you have all of those features that are tied with it, this a bad oversimplification in my eyes. Which features are measured today? 

If you are eating normally (and healthy), you don't need supplements. Protein is not a magic muscle gainer, workouts are. 

I doubt that these stands are intended to be actually used with the weights described by the manufacturer. I guess the manufacturer only labels it with the weight you can put onto them without breaking them. I am using stands comparable to those in your picture when I visit my parents, they have a heavy disk at the bottom instead of extensions. Assuming a normal backsquat where you step back after lifting the bar out of the rack, the danger lies in the step forward when you finished your set. You are probably exhausted and are not completely able to control the step forward, you are happy to just slam the weights in the stand. Although this isn't how it should be, I guess this happens to everybody once in a while. I am not even big - 173cm / 5'8 - and even with small weights - I encountered the problem even with an empty bar (10kg in my case) - those stands will tip back a bit. The higher the weight is positioned and the bigger the plates get, the more careful you have to be, as the lever is quite big when squatting a high bar. It is probably safer to use other equipment if possible, however it depends on your goals, too. If you don't want to engage in a powerlifting (or strength gain) program and continue to lift in a lower range, these stands might be OK to buy, especially when just starting or having limited space. 

While the penis itself isn't a muscle that can be trained, but simply speaking just a sponge for blood, there are three muscles that are responsible for supporting ejaculation and maintaining an erection via compression of blood vessels. Musculus retractor penis It doesn't seem like this muscle is important in humans, the english wikipedia article doesn't tell much nor does the german version. It still exists in humans. Bulbospongiosus: 

In case you have not seen them, there are three sites on the StrongLifts page itself dedicated to increasing mobility. 

Of those I have only been doing the shoulder dislocations. Contrary to what the author of stronglifts says I would not recommend using a flexible band. This only makes it harder to keep your arms parallel to each other. Of course I didn't come up with that itself, it's what the coach in this video says. 

I started doing sports (mostly bicycling and swimming) half a year ago and started running a few weeks ago. I did not change my diet for any of those activities. The only reason I changed my diet was to lose weight. As long as you feel that you are living and eating healthy now, there is no real need to change your diet. You should however pay attention to your drinking habits. You will lose more water due sweating and your body might need some more water for muscle build up. I am not a big fan of supplements, but there are lacks on certain vitamins, minerals or trace elements in certain regions and you might want to ensure that your bodies supply on those is sufficient. I would recommend you not to eat to heavy immediately before running, it can be very uncomfortable. 

If you take a look at A Biometric Study of Human Basal Metabolism, where Harris and Benedict introduced their formula, you will see one important sentence: 

As this is a health question you should not rely on diagnoses given through the Internet. Go see a professional, that means someone who studied this stuff, a Sports Medicine Doctor or at least a general physician. Chiropractors, Manual Therapists, Gym Trainers, you never know how experienced they are, what they base their knowledge on, and if they got their certificate on a weekend course or if they worked a year for that. (This of course differs from country to country, too) From the hearsay I overheard when at my physiotherapist, I would guess that your base core muscles are too weak to support you. You can check this with planks and side planks. My next guess would be, that you have overstressed your joints. Your muscles and tendons adapt to new motions and exercises a lot faster than your bones and joints do, you could have permanently wrecked your cartilage. But again, what do I know, I can scare the heck out of you or give you advice that wont help your problem, so please: Go see a professional 

If you worry that alcohol prevents recovery of muscle, there are studies that show that high alcohol consumption actually does. 

If you were to train every muscle in the body, I only count the "show off muscles" here, like biceps, triceps, abs, etc not all in the body, you would train each muscle about once in a week, if not even less. It is widely accepted that muscles need some rest after you train them, but for achieving most muscle growth you should train them in when they are in the recovery phase. When this phase begins depends - as far as I remember - on the person and the muscle, but is generally said to be about two days later. Depending on what results you want to get it might be a good idea to use isolation exercises instead of compound exercises, that is focusing on a specific muscle instead of a bigger group or the whole body. But training it only once a week would probably not get you the results you want. My approach, if I would go to the gym twice a day would either be to think of four muscle groups I want to train (eg, abs&back, shoulders, arms, legs) and alternate between those sub-plans, If my goal was not too specific I would rotate them each week. Another possibility would be to do cardio in the morning and muscle training in the evening, with two focused sets. Again, it heavily depends on your specific goals how you show arrange your training. 

*) this activity is not recommended for people over 55, they should talk with a medical professional before attempting. 

The US Navy combined elements of freestyle, sidestroke and breaststroke to develop the Combat Sidestroke. It can be used with or without flippers, the swimmer only has to use a flutter kick instead of a scissor kick.2. 

If you want to be stronger you need to train your whole body, otherwise you will end up with a huge upper body, but lacking strength because your lower body can't support it. There are a lot of exercises you can do at home, if you want to continue doing push ups, which are great for your upper body, but strengthen your core, too, you might want to either go for more or make them even more complicated, even without a resistance band. You could try Diamond Push Ups, basically it is a normal push up, but you put your hands close together so that you thumb and index finger form a diamond shape. If you happen to have an exercise ball at home, you can do push ups on that, too. The legs on the ball or the hands on the ball. Those are a pretty strenuous exercises that train your stabilizing muscles in the back. You should do more than those two exercises you mention, as said above, go for a workout that trains all your muscles, of course you can set a focus, but you shouldn't ignore the others. Check out the link above, there are other programs listed, eg for crunches and dips. If you need more dig around for other body weight exercises. I personally do body weight exercises thrice a week, Monday, Wednesday and Friday. If you need the two days rest, take them, otherwise you could do more. As always you have to listen to your body first before listening to other people (especially those on the Internet). Your food plan sounds OK judging from what you tell, but check your drinking habits as well.
