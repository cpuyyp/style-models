Initially a large part of the money raised came from overseas (chiefly from the Dutch). However, due to the changing political situation by the time of the Napoleonic War, the money from the Dutch had mostly dried up. However, 

It appears to be a club in Boston and the date I'm guessing is the year the membership list was taken from. 

At the time of the changeover from wheellocks to flintlocks, most gun manufacture was bespoke, so it's not easy to find 'retail' prices for equivalent weapons. The best I could find was the following comparison: 

This is a tricky question to answer definitively given the complexity of the 250+ years of history of the East India Company in its various forms (referred to here, for simplicity, as the HEIC). While I think it would be impossible to prove that no single HEIC ship ever visited any part of the West Indies, I think it is safe to say that they didn't 'operate' in the West Indies (i.e. they didn't trade regularly or have any permanent presence there). The English (and later British) Joint Stock companies that were created for foreign ventures split into two types. The 'old world' ventures, like the East India Company and the Levant Company, were essentially trading companies where trading posts and colonies were created as a by-product of establishing trade. The 'new world' ventures, such as the Virginia Company, existed to create colonies (or "plantations") where trade was a by-product of the colonisation. So there was a difference in ethos between the companies trading to the East and West. The HEIC spent most of its existence fighting to protect its trade to the East Indies. While, at times, it had the theoretical advantage of possessing a monopoly on the trade, this monopoly only existed in terms of English (and later British) competition. The Portuguese, French and Dutch (especially) had their own East India companies each of which was competing to bring trade back to Europe and prevent their competitors from doing the same. Not only that but it had to fight constant political battles to protect this priviliged position in Parliament and in the Royal court. While the East Indies trade made the HEIC considerable amounts of money, much of this was reinvested in protecting its position from all comers (to the point that it was on the verge of bankruptcy on several occasions). Had the HEIC tried to branch out into trade with the new world, it wouldn't have had the advantage of a monopoly (which allowed for significantly higher freight rates) so the trade it had would have been significantly less profitable than trade to the East Indies. Since it always had a limited number of ships available, therefore, it would make little commercial sense to use their time on significantly less profitable trips to the West Indies. Also attempting to spread its influence to other parts of the world would probably have provoked calls from other British trading companies to remove the monopoly the HEIC had to the East.

It was also Edward's skill as a soldier, with his understanding of the science of war, that allowed him to see how the longbow could be a vital weapon on the battlefield by combining his bowmen with dismounted knights and men-at-arms. 

Did the problems of tactical control contribute to the failure of the operation and the loss of ships on the return? Certainly control over the fleet was never fully re-established following the flight from Calais but bad luck and poor navigation played a larger part in its losses. It was never part of the plan for the fleet to sail around the British Isles to return, so I'd imagine that the maps available for that part were more rudimentary. By the time they reached the open waters of the Atlantic many of the ships were in poor condition and were barely sea worthy. The relatively primitive navigation aids of the period meant that they failed to establish their position accurately. As a result, they ended up turning south far too close to the British isles. This, combined with unusually bad weather, lead to a large number of losses on the Scottish and Irish coasts. 

In person - The subordinate officers could meet the commander on his ship to receive orders. This allowed commanders to discuss strategy and tactics at a detailed level more quickly than would have been possible with any other method. Written instructions - These could be strategic communications, passed by despatch boats back to Spain and ahead to the Duke of Palma, or tactical communications within the fleet passed by ship's boat. These were most useful for passing more complicated orders than flags, guns or lights could transmit. Flags - While this seems an obvious method, it must be remembered that there was nothing like the signal codes and fighting instructions that were common to the professional navies of the late 17th and 18th Centuries. Flag signals would have been limited to pre-arranged orders such as "attack", "withdraw", "follow me", "anchor here", etc. Guns - Signal guns used in much the same way as flags to pass pre-arranged orders. They had the advantage of being useful at night or in poor visibility but were, obviously, of little use during a battle. Shouting - Orders could passed ship to ship by voice when they were close enough. This could also be used when sending a boat between ships to avoid any tricky transfer between boat and ship. While this method was limited in range, it did allow for more complex orders to be passed. Lights - Useful at night but even more limited than flags and guns in passing orders. 

The French navy suffered considerably due to the French revolution. Having finished the American War of Independence on something approaching a high (comparatively speaking), the French navy suffered a reverse that it never fully recovered from until well after the finish of the Napoleonic Wars. Like most other European navies of the time, the officers were often from the upper-classes and, as you probably guessed, there was a large-scale purge of these officers in the early period in question. Their replacements were rarely of high quality and, too often, had little or no experience of commanding a warship at sea, much less a warship in combat. Many of the aristocratic officer class fled the country (or failed to return) and these emigrés wound up in the navies of Britain, Austria and Russia fighting against their former homeland. Also the fervour of revolution and its ideal of equality meant that these replacement officers often had little control over the ship's crews. As an example, at the start of 1793 Vice-Admiral Morard de Galles took a small squadron to sea from Brest, upon their return he commented on the crew: 

The crux of his argument seems to be that because the British and Combined Fleets had come together purely as the result of Napoleon's invasion plan, once the threat of invasion was removed, there was no longer any purpose in the fleets engaging. He dismisses the mission that brought the combined fleet out of Cadiz (supporting French forces in Italy) as "entirely secondary" and so, presumably, of no strategic value to either side. Although the article doesn't explictly state it, I'm assuming that Monaque supposes that the alternative to battle would have been the continued blockade of the combined fleet in Cádiz (until the Spanish revolt in 1808). From a strategic point of view, would that have had the same outcome or were there stategic benefits to fighting? 

Making the paintings more portable allowed an artist to expand his potential market beyond his local area. It also made it easier to produce paintings "in the field" since the key materials were easier to get to the location. 

I cant answer for every country but for Britain, the move to formal education of naval gunnery officers came fairly late. The Royal Artillery College at Woolwich had been established in 1741 to train army officers in the necessary sciences. By comparison, the Royal Navy first established their gunnery school (known as HMS Excellent) as late as 1830. Brian Lavery in "Nelson's Navy" (Conway Press, 1989) says, of officers during the French Revolutionary & Napoleonic Wars, 

In effect, the purpose of the early laws was to distance the aggresive actions of the subject from that of the state while giving the injured party approval for a measured retaliation. 

The simple answer is that often the people involved write down (or verbally pass on information that is later written down by other people) these 'private communications' after the event, in memoirs, journals, letters, etc. Also 'official' secrets don't have to permanently stay secret, especially if the original reason for keeping them secret no longer applies, so 'private' correspondence and documents can be released to the public (and therefore to historians) once the need for secrecy is gone. The issue of fabrication is a different one and opens up a wider discussion of intended and accidental bias in historical reporting. There's also the issue of (mis)interpretation if the original language of the parties in the conversation is different to the language used by the historian. 

The reason for the re-emergence of the ram in the mid-1800s is essentially a technological one. The introduction of the nautical steam engine gave ships a reliable source of power and the ability to move in any direction, and the introduction of armor-plating gave them greater weight (and therefore momentum), structural strength and protection. During the Age-of-Sail most warships were wind-powered, square-rigged ships and, almost exclusively, had a broadside armament. This leads to several limitations; 

Rifleman Dodd is a work of fiction that is based upon and in real world events. Forester was a kean history buff and he did a lot of research which went into his books. For example, his more famous Hornblower series is based on a fictional sailor who rises through the ranks but it includes real ships, people and events. The lead character's adventures often include fictionalised versions of exploits by real sailors of the period. Similarly "Rifleman Dodd" is a fictional character that interacts with real people and events. The background events really happened and his regiment, the 95th Rifles, were really involved. it's just his personal exploits that are fiction. Forester was fortunate that several members of the Rifle Brigade (the 95th) wrote journals and autobiographies after the war. Together these give a good account of the world these men inhabited, how they were recruited, what day-to-day life was like in the Peninsular and what it was like in and after battle.

Like much legistation, the role of the letter of marque evolved from it's initial inception to it's eventual demise. The original purpose of the letter of marque and reprisal (to use the full title), was to allow subjects the ability to gain their own 'recompense' for injuries inflicted on them by foreign powers without the need for the states to go to war. Where "marque" referred to the crossing of frontiers and "reprisal" was the taking of goods in return (for the injuries previously suffered). 

Hoche himself described the force, raised in secret, in a letter to the Directorate, on the 11th December 1796... 

The individual reasons for the survival of the European microstates can be read from their histories on their respective wikipedia pages but in general it comes down to two main factors; firstly by the 19th Century they were already protectorates of larger neighbours and, secondly, they were too small to bother with. As an example of the first point, both Andorra and Monaco were effectively French protectorates and had been for centuries. Liechtenstein was initially part of the HRE, briefly under French control as part of the Confederation of the Rhine and then a protectorate of the Austrian Empire. In almost all cases, these were states with little or no military power and so posed no direct threat to their neighbours. They had few natural resources and they had correspondingly small populations, neither of which were worth invading to exploit. The exceptional microstate was Malta. After its capture from the French, it lost its independence and became part of the British Empire, remaining so until 1964. The difference being that Malta had great strategic value as a base in the middle of the Mediterranean Sea. 

It's also worth noting the far greater number of men that were medically discharged/invalided from the Navy in 1812. 

In his book "A Social History of the Navy 1793-1815", Michael Lewis gives the following breakdown of the background of Navy officers based on their parents' social status. 

As Wheeler & Broadley rightly noted, "No plan was assuredly ever conceived more entirely calculated to defeat its own object". In the event, the force that landed near Fishguard, on 22nd February 1797, consisted of around 1,400 men (with no artillery or cavalry). After a brief stand-off with the local militia force, the French surrendered without a fight on the 24th February, having shown little intention of doing anything else. 

By 1944 Germany was on the defensive and needed every man that was available. General conscription had been introduced in 1935, at which time it was a fairly accomodating system that allowed people some flexibility in when they did their service, but towards the end of the war this became "all hands on deck". 

"Rhineland; "GO 33 WD 45 as amended" is made up of the following: The first part, "Rhineland", states in which campaign area the soldier was in service. For soldiers that were in service for a long period, this could include multiple campaigns, such as “Naples-Foggia Sicily Normandy Rhineland Ardennes Central Europe”. "GO 33" refers to General Order 33 (which related to Battle Honors), while "WD 45" stands for War Department 1945 (the year in which the General Order was published) General Order 33, doesn't include "Rhineland" as one of its Theaters of Operation, that was added by General Order 40 (which was a amendment of GO 33 with changes to the Rome-Arno & Ardennes campaign areas as well as changing the of name of the "Germany" campaign to "Rhineland"). So presumably, the "as amended" part is actually refering to GO 40. From here, it's worth looking at the linked pdf too (note: the GOs are listed in reverse). 

As the wikipedia article states, the quote is from Charles Mackay's "Memoirs of Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds". The quoted lines appear on page 57, as item 17 in a list of over 80 "bubble" companies that were made illegal and abolished by the Privy council on the 12th July 1720. No further details are included. Without the company name or it's company officers, it would be impossible to determine who started the company and what it's purpose was (if it had one other than fraud). 

If you're willing to accept a snapshot of British society in the later part of the period, then you can reference the table given here which was taken from A Treatise on the wealth, power and resources of the British Empire (1814). While the data covers the whole of the British Empire (of the time), I would presume that the social stratification would be fairly uniform. So the percentage of rich to poor would be roughly the same for the British Isles as it would for the empire as a whole. Taking the given definition of 'rich' being any free holder with a couple of staff, which would roughly correspond to the fifth class and above (I've ignored those in military service), we would get; Rich - 4,316,110 Poor - 24,958,603 Which gives us an answer for 'rich' people of about 14% of the population.
