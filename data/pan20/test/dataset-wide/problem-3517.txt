Weibull discusses the issues with not knowing the actual payoff functions, the players not knowing the actual payoff functions (incomplete information), and situations where game theorists are less clear about what game theory is supposed to predict. 

There is a problem in how you translate completeness into behavior. Let $R$ be any binary relation, representing preferences, on a set $X$ of alternatives and $A\subseteq X$ be a nonempty set of alternatives available. The usual assumption is that the decisionmaker chooses an alternative $a\in A$ optimally according to the relation $R$. Here are three ways to interpret this: 

Scrooge McDuck likes swimming in money, which is why he accumulates a lot of it without any intention of ever spending it. If you think bringing in Scrooge McDuck is far-fetched and irrelevant, you are right. People do not generally accumulate wealth with no intention of ever spending it. But suppose there were such people and, to make things concrete, their wealth is in terms of houses. They don't live in these houses or use them in any way- otherwise, they would have consumption patterns very different from the rest of us. So there are a lot of unused houses standing around. You may consider such unused resources a problem. 

Yes, there is no equilibrium in pure strategies. For any price charged by firm 2 above $c_1$, firm one could only best respond by charging the largest price that is strictly smaller. which is impossible. If both firms charge at most $c_1$, one of these firms must make a loss, which cannot be a best response. So there is no Nash equilibrium in pure strategies. There are, however, equilibria in mixed strategies. Consider an equilibrium in which firm 1 chooses a price of $c_2$, while firm two randomizes uniformly over the interval $[c_2,c_2+\epsilon]$ for some $\epsilon>0$. For $\epsilon<c_2-c_1$, this is a Nash equilibrium and, moreover, it uses no weakly dominated strategies. Firm 1 is making a profit of $c_2-c_1$ and firm 2 a profit of $0$. Clearly, firm 2 has no profitable deviation. To see that firm $1$ has no profitable deviation, recall that there can be no profitable deviation in mixed strategies if there is no profitable deviation in pure strategies (a very general game-theoretic fact), and observe that firm $1$ cannot profit from deviating to a price strictly below $c_2$ or weakly above $c_2+\epsilon$. So take any $\delta$ satisfying $0<\delta<\epsilon$ and assume that firm 1 charges $c_2+\delta$ (note that $\delta=0$ would be no deviation.) The probability that firm 2 charges a lower price is $\delta/\epsilon$, so the expected profit of firm 1 is $$(1-\delta/\epsilon)(c_2-c_1+\delta)+\delta/\epsilon~ 0.$$ Write $K$ for $c_2-c_1$. We have a profitable deviation if $$(1-\delta/\epsilon)(K+\delta)>K,$$ which we can rearrange to get $$\delta(1-K/\epsilon-\delta/\epsilon)>0,$$ which is equivalent to $$K/\epsilon+\delta/\epsilon<1.$$ If $\epsilon< c_2-c_1=K$, this can never be the case, so we obtain a Nash equilibrium if $\epsilon>c_2-c_1$. One can actually use the same construction to construct equilibria in which firm 1 charges less than $c_2$, but in the resulting equilibrium, firm 2 must play a weakly dominated strategy. The construction in this answer is taken from the following short paper: Blume, Andreas. "Bertrand without fudge." Economics Letters 78.2 (2003): 167-168. 

In a 1929 paper, Harold Hotelling introduced what became the standard model of spatial competition. Two firms position themselves on an interval, which induces a certain demand structure, and then compete in prices. The model was influential and widely taught. The message was that firms diferentiate minimally, both locate in the center. But in 1979 (!) paper, d'Aspremont, Gabszewicz, and Thisse pointed out that the model has actually no equilibrium under Hotelling's original specifications. There is an important discontinuity that Hotelling and everyone afterwards ignored. 

No, the unique Nash equilibrium is the unique correlated equilibrium by a general property of two-player zero-sum games pointed out in: 

One can actually show the existence of solutions to the model by simpler methods, as David Gale eventually did, but here is the result of von Neumann in modern language: Theorem: Let $C$ and $K$ be nonempty convex and compact subsets of Euclidean spaces (of not necessarily the same dimension). Let $E$ and $F$ be closed subsets of $C\times K$ such that for each $x\in C$, the set $E_x=\{y\in K\mid (x,y)\in E\}$ is nonempty, convex, and compact and such that for each $y\in K$, the set $F^y=\{x\in C:(x,y)\in F\}$ is nonempty, convex, and compact. Then $E\cap F\neq\emptyset$. That Kakutani's fixed point theorem implies the result of von Neumann is shown in Kakutani's paper. But Kakutani's fixed point theorem is also an easy consequence of von Neumann's theorem. If $C=K$, then the assumptions on $E$ say that $E$ is the graph of an upper hemicontinuous correspondence with nonempty, convex, and compact values from $C$ to itself. That this correspondence has a fixed-point is equivalent to a point of the form $(x,x)$ being in the graph. Now if we let $F$ being the diagonal of $C$, that is $F=\{(x,x)\mid x\in C\}$, then $E$ and $F$ satisfy the conditions of von Neumann's result, so the intersection must be empty and the correspondence with graph $E$ must have a fixed-point. A reprint of von Neumann's paper can be found in this book. An English translation can be found here. 

There is an old result in dynamic programming due to David Blackwell, according to which stationary problems allow for stationary best responses. So if you would gain by changing your behavior after a certain history, you would gain by changing it at every history corresponding to the same state. For the original reference, see the corollary to Theorem 1 here. 

Convexity of the production set is indeed not needed for the proof of the first welfare theorem but for the proof of the second welfare theorem. It is not a necessary condition though. It is possible to interpret this as an existence issue. The first welfare theorem is about all competitive equilibria and holds trivially if there are none. The second welfare theorem, on the other hand, states that for a given Pareto efficient allocation, there is a price system and redistribution of endowments with respect to which it is a (quasi-)equilibrium. The standard proof of the second welfare theorem uses a result of Minkowski on the separation of nonoverlapping convex sets by a hyperplane, but it is possible to prove a version of the second welfare theorem as a corollary to an existence result by a nice argument due to Maskin and Roberts. The argument is quite easy in the case of an exchange economy: Take a Pareto efficient allocation as the endowment distribution. If a competitive equilibrium exists from these endowments, everyone will end up with something at least as good as their endowment. Since the endowment distribution was Pareto efficient, nobody can end up with something better. So everyone must be indifferent between their demanded commodity bundle and their endowment, so they might as well just demand just their endowment. The argument generalizes to economies with production. 

It is not that surprising if you have the right intuition, but let's make sure we consider it unsurprising for the right reasons. Roy's identity can be rewritten as $$x^*_{i}(\text{p},m)\frac{\partial v}{\partial m}=-\frac{\partial v}{\partial p_{i}}.$$ The right-hand side is the marginal utility loss from a price increase. The left-hand side is the amount of good $i$ consumed times the marginal utility of money. If the consumer were forced to consume exactly $x^*_{i}(\text{p},m)$ units of good $i$, this would be obvious. The consumer has to pay proportionally more of the income on buying good $i$, and cannot spend it on other things whose marginal utility equals the marginal utility of money. Of course, the consumer can make adjustments and is not forced to hold the amount fixed. But, similar as in Hotelling's lemma, the consumer who is at an optimum need not do any adjusting, indirect effects are negligible. And showing the latter is more than just evaluating utility at the appropriate Marshallian demands. 

The result that destruction can be beneficial comes from a paper by Robert Aumann and Bezalel Peleg, "A Note on Gale's Example," Journal of Mathematical Economics 1 (1974) pp. 209-211. 

Strict convexity of preferences is not needed in existence results for competitive equilibria. Leontief preferences are quite well-behaved. They are continuous, convex, and strongly monotonic. If all endowments are strictly positive, the existence of a competitive equilibrium in an exchange economy (or a production economy satisfying standard conditions) exists by the first result of the original Arrow-Debreu paper. Arrow-Debreu actually do not just require convexity, they make, as pointed out by denesp in a comment, the convexity assumption (III.c) on utility functions that $u(x)>u(x')$ and $0<t<1$ implies $u(tx+(1-t)x')>u(x')$. Plain convexity suffices for existence, but Leontief preferences do also satisfy condition (III.c).: Assume $\min\{\alpha_i x_i\}>\min\{\alpha_i x_i'\}$. Then $$\min\big\{\alpha_i (tx_i+(1-t)x_i')\big\}>\min\big\{\alpha_i tx_i\big\}+\min\big\{\alpha_i(1-t) x_i'\big\}$$ $$=t\min\{\alpha_i x_i\}+(1-t)\min\{\alpha_i x_i'\}>\min\{\alpha_i x_i'\}.$$ 

I don't quite know what it means to apply a mathematical result to a situation in which the assumptions are violated, but the same idea as in the classical version of Hotelling's lemma can be used to understand the marginal effect of wage changes and you can combine the two to understand what happens on the margin if you change both prices and wages. The underlying logic of Hotelling's lemma was that for a profit-maximizing firm, the marginal effect of adjustment outputs (and therefore inputs) is zero. This tells us that the marginal effect of wage changes on profits should be proportional to inputs used, that is $$\frac{\partial \pi(p,w)}{\partial w}=-x(p,w),$$ with $x(p,w)$ the optimal input bundle. This is indeed true and the proof is exactly the same as for the marginal effect of $p$, just replace the derivative with respect to $p$ by the derivative with respect to $w$. If $f$ is the production function, the profit function is given by $$\pi(p,w)=pf\big(x(p,w)\big)-wx(p,w).$$ Taking the derivative with respect to $w$ now gives us $$\frac{\partial \pi(p,w)}{\partial w}=pf'\big(x(p,w)\big)\frac{\partial x(p,w)}{\partial w}- x(p,w)-w\frac{\partial x(p,w)}{\partial w}.$$ The first order condition for $x(p,w)$ being a maximizer of $pf(x)-wx$ implies $$pf'\big(x(p,w)\big)- x(p,w)-w=0$$ and therefore $$pf'\big(x(p,w)\big)\frac{\partial x(p,w)}{\partial w}-w\frac{\partial x(p,w)}{\partial w}=0.$$ Substituting this in, we get $$\frac{\partial \pi(p,w)}{\partial w}=-x(p,w).$$ The envelope theorem generalizes the underlying idea that marginal benefits of adjustments for optimizing agents are zero for more general parameterized optimization problems. 

Yes. The Debreu version of the Sonnenschein-Mantel-Debreu theorem guarantees that excess demand has to satisfy very little restrictions if there are as many consumers as commodities. An explicit example of multiple equilibria in a $2\times 2$-exchange economy can be found in 

Quasi-concave utility functions represent convex preferences. But that preferences are convex means that the weakly-better sets are convex, it is not about the convexity of any function. 

So why should it count? Well, the Kakutani fixed point theorem is largely a variant (with a simplified proof) of a Lemma John von Neumann introduced in Karl Menger's mathematical colloquium in order to solve an economic growth model. 

Decreasing marginal returns to a factor means that keeping the other factors fixed, the marginal output generated by this factor is decreasing. When looking at returns to scale, we change all outputs. Increasing a factor with decreasing marginal returns can have an indirect effect in increasing the marginal productivity of other factors. If we increase all factors at the same time, the indirect effects may outweigh the direct effect. The production function $F:\mathbb{R}_+^2$ given by $$F(x,y)=(x+1)^{2/3}(y+1)^{2/3}$$ has decreasing marginal factor productivities everywhere but not decreasing returns to scale (it doesn't have increasing returns to scale either). 

For Pareto optimality, you can ignore the timing. Also, anything you know about Nash equilibria in this game is irrelevant. Let $v_F(w, L)$ be the payoff of the firm and $v_U(w, L)$ be the payoff of the union given $(w, L)$. What you are looking for are pairs $(w, L)$ such that neither the firm nor the union can have a higher payoff without the other side having a lower payoff. Equivalently, you want to the payoff of the firm to be as large as possible under the constraint that the union cannot have a lower payoff and you want the payoff of the union to be as large as possible under the constraint that the firm cannot have a lower payoff. This means that $(w,L)$ is Pareto optimal if and only if it solves the following two maximization problems: $$\max_{(w',L')} v_F~\text{ s.t.}~v_U(w',L')\geq v_U(w,L).$$ $$\max_{(w',L')} v_U~\text{ s.t.}~v_F(w',L')\geq v_F(w,L).$$ Now if you just have to find one Pareto optimum and not all Pareto optima, you can just maximize $v_F+v_U$. 

You are basically on the right track but might have been carried away by not writing down function arguments. The profit function $\pi$ has arguments $p$ and $w$; don't drop them. In Hotelling's lemma, $y$ is the output. On the other hand, you write $y$ for the production function. Let's make things clear by writing neutrally $f$ for the production function. The profit-maximizing input choice is $x(p,w)$, so the quantity produced is $f\big(x(p,w)\big)$, the correct meaning of $y$ in Hotelling's lemma. Hotelling's lemma then becomes $$\frac{\partial \pi(p,w)}{\partial p}=f\big(x(p,w)\big).$$ The profit function is given by $$\pi(p,w)=pf\big(x(p,w)\big)-wx(p,w).$$ Taking the derivative with respect to $p$ gives us $$\frac{\partial \pi(p,w)}{\partial p}=f\big(x(p,w)\big)+pf'\big(x(p,w)\big)\frac{\partial x(p,w)}{\partial p}-w\frac{\partial x(p,w)}{\partial p}.$$ This is pretty much what you got there above. Now $x(p,w)$ is by definition a maximizer of $pf(x)-wx$. We have the first order condition $pf'(x^*)=w$. Therefore, $$pf'\big(x(p,w)\big)-w=0,$$ which implies $$pf'\big(x(p,w)\big)\frac{\partial x(p,w)}{\partial p}-w\frac{\partial x(p,w)}{\partial p}=0$$ This reduces our expression for ${\partial \pi(p,w)}/{\partial p}$ to Hotelling's lemma. This tell's us also what the important message of Hotelling's lemma is: Indirect effects don't matter. A marginal change in prices has a direct effect on profits since the output gets multiplied by a different number. There is also an indirect effect that comes from firms adjusting how much to produce. Hotelling's lemma just tells us that the latter effect is zero for a profit-maximizing firm, which need not do much adjusting. At a profit maximum, the marginal effect of adjusting production on profits is zero. 

We have an allocation $(x^*,y^*)$ and a price system $p$ forming a price equilibrium with transfers.The assignment of wealth levels $(w_1,\ldots,w_I)$ has to satisfy $$\sum_i w_i=p\cdot\bar{\omega}+\sum_j p\cdot y_j^*.$$ One way to interpret the wealth levels is that the planner hands out coupons that can be traded at existing prices for commodities and chooses the production plans of the economy. But one can interpret the wealth distribution also as a distribution of the initial endowments and of firm shares. Let $w=\sum_i w_i$ and for each consumer $i$, let $m_i=w_i/w$, which is just the share consumer $i$ has in the aggregate wealth. Now give each consumer an endowment $\omega_i$ of $m_i \bar{\omega}$ and for each firm $j$ a share $\theta_{ij}$ equal to $m_i$. For the resulting private ownership economy, $(x^*,y^*)$ and $p$ constitute a Walrasian equilibrium, so one has reduced redistributing wealth to redistributing endowments and shares in firms. To see that everything works out, note that $$w_i=m_i w=m_i\bigg(p\cdot\bar{\omega}+\sum_j p\cdot y^*_j\bigg)=p\cdot m_i\bar{w}+\sum_j m_i p\cdot y_j^*=p\cdot \omega_i+\sum_j\theta_{ij} p\cdot y_j^*.$$ 

I know a lot of examples of mathematical results that have been first developed in economics, mostly result in set-valued analysis and convex analysis. My ignorance of engineering and physics keeps me from listing many examples there. Many results in optimal transport have certainly been used in many other areas. The Kakutani fixed-point theorem should also make the list in my humble opinion. Now Shizuo Kakutani was a pure mathematician who published this purely mathematical result in a pure math journal: 

There are three players, 1,2,3, and the action spaces of players 1 and 2 are both $[0,1]\times\mathbb{N}$, the action space of player 3 is $[0,1]$. The generic action of player 1 is written as $(x,m)$, the generic action of player 2 is written as $(y,n)$, and the generic action of player 3 is written as $(x')$. The payoff of player 3 is simply $1$ if $x'=x$ and $0$ otherwise. The payoffs of players 1 and 2 are more complicated. The payoff of player 1 and 2 is both $2$ if $y=x\neq x'$, and both $-2$ if $x=x'$. In the case that $y\neq x\neq x'$, the player with the highest number in the second coordinate gets a payoff of $1$ and the one with the lower number gets $-1$. If they pick the same number, they get both $0$. This game has no Nash equilibrium. Suppose there were one. If player 1 would not randomize in equilibrium, player 3 can match them for a lousy payoff of $-2$. By randomizing the payoff will be higher, but it will also be the case that with positive probability $y\neq x\neq x'$, since the behavior of all players is stochastically independent. But then both 1 and 2 have to play the game of picking a higher number and that game has no equilibrium even in mixed strategies (if mixed strategies must be countably additive). But there is a correlated equilibrium in which the behavior of 1 and 2 is given by a distribution on the diagonal $D=\{(x,y)\mid x=y\}$ without mass points, and player 3 plays anything stochastically independent. Player 1 and 2 can clearly do no better and there is no way for 3 to match 1 with positive probability.
