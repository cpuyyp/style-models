In addition to Nijs answer: For a single elimination tournament (playoff style) the number of games are X-1 (X being the number of participants) and 2^Y per participant (or less - see below) Lets say with 16 participating teams you'd have 15 games: 

Luckily Germany was awarded a penalty after the game was already over, thanks to the video technology (Game report). Now Slovenia files a protest hoping to get the match replayed. Although I like that decision I am not sure if it was a correct one... 

The term originates from French ("ailier de débordement") and got probably translated badly in the process. If my French isn't too rusty you're right and it's just a term for a traditional Winger who's main purpose is to overrun and escape the defenders (not "overflow" them). (See this article) 

Yes, it can be deadly. The Biathlon rifles from ANSCHÜTZ (and probably the others too) are Caliber .22 and are built for extreme precision, not for being safe against abuse (that would be impossible). And if you zoom in on that picture you can see that the ammo looks very serious too. Although the bullet speed is only 500 mph (normal bullets travel four to five times as fast) it will definitely hurt a lot. 

My interpretation is that they wanted to increase the number of hurdles to 10 but also keep the spacing. To do so they could just increase to 100 metres. This reasoning is also followed in the debate 80 meter hurdles?: 

Men's side Since the Open Era began in 1968, and until 2013, this only happened in 1969. That year, Rod Laver (born 1938) won the Grand Slam, which means he won all of them: Wimbledon, Australian Open, Roland Garros and US Open. I got to this result by parsing the results in Age of Grand Slam Winners - Open Era and completing those with List of List of Grand Slam men's singles champions. I added an extra column which contains solely the age (without months) and then did some scripting with it: 

I went through the IAAF site and checked the list of senior outdoor results on 100 metres men over years from 2001 until 2018 (for example, see the results from 2016). Considering those, I checked the worst position of a runner when running below 10 s, which means that that amount of people ran below that time. These are the results: On 4 times, 6 men ran below 10 s (see the 6 before the city where the championship was held; it represents the position): 

In the World Cup 2014, the semi-finals were held on 8th/9th July, and the final will be on 13th July. This gives Germany an extra day to rest/prepare compared to Argentina. This has been mentioned by the Argentinian coach, Alejandro Sabella: 

Your experienced in the bar of an initial improvement, then a decline, has also been studied in a controlled environment. Researchers T. Reilly and J. Scott summarized their study as follows: 

After the break, you can determine your group by calling a ball and pocketing it. But the rules explicitly say that you can't strike the eight-ball when the table is open. 

Well I didn't think this could ever happen, and that any punishment would be achieved by docking points, but at least according to the table in Wikipedia some games resulted in both teams losing. Summing the columns for wins and losses, you can see that 222 games were won, and 226 games lost. The total goal difference is also at -12. 

For certain, the governing body will not be happy with the behaviour of the other team and their coach, and it seems inconceivable that they would be rewarded for walking off by granting a rematch. In the simple case of a team being unable to play the match to the end due to players being injured or having to leave, you would probably be awarded the 3 points via a standard score set out in the rules (e.g. 3-0). If the other team are lucky, and have a good reputation, this is what will happen here too. But given that they refused to play after a disagreement with the referee, despite having enough players, and that the referee was pushed by a player, there could be more serious consequences for the team. You'll have to wait and see what the governing body decide. 

Secondly, does the rebound count? The other question is: Was the rebound an action where offside actually counts? The Laws are pretty clear in this case: 

If no the player who deflected the ball scored the goal. If yes it's up to the officials to decide (see below). 

Surprisingly, Football is one of these. The only restriction is a maximum age of 23 for the men's competition. 

The downhill competitions don't rely on wind that much. If it's too strong the whole competition will be postponed (they actually did that), so no athlete will have (dis)advantages due to different conditions. In downhill the piste is much more important and of course the weather altogether: 

The video shows the European Championships. So it simply wasn't an Olympic competition in that video. He achieved the Olympic record in the Sydney 2000 games with 180 kg, so that number is actually correct. And as you can see on that list every kg counts, so 1 kg increments are possible and achievable. An Olympic record is only recognized as such if it was achieved in the Olympics, even if it is the world record (or was in this case, since the world record has been beaten in 2007 when Andrei Rybakou lifted 187 kg in the World Championships). 

There are many skills you need to learn, and you need to find a team that practice regularly and will give you time to learn from them. Passing, receiving a pass, shooting and tackling are all obvious things that any player needs to do. But coming from Rugby I would suggest two things that may be alien at first 

The more telling statistics for a wicket keeper in the field are the number of dropped catches and missed stumpings per match. In the professional game, you would expect the wicketkeeper to catch all but the most difficult chances, and to cleanly gather the ball and attempt a stumping whenever possible. An example of this is when the England wicketkeeper Matt Prior was dropped for the series against New Zealand in 2008. The explanation by the Chairman of selectors was 

I doubt that this is the record, as Evans and the referee had a short discussion between the two cards, and assume that there must have been quicker double yellows in similar circumstances. 

From this definition it should be clear that this statistic will be positively correlated with driving accuracy, driving distance, accuracy and distance from sand, accuracy and distance from the rough etc. Returning to reality, there may be serious practical difficulties in finding out these average strokes remaining for large parts of the course, much of which is rarely played by the pro's, and the value would wildly vary in the chaotic world of deep rough and bunkers. So I wouldn't expect to see a reliable SG for each individual stroke any time soon, especially considering winds and changing pin positions. But everyone starts at the tee, and most end up putting from the green, so statistics from putting from 7ft 10in are available. For this reason it makes sense to just take the tee and green values, and calculate the rest as the difference. By doing this we lose the information of what happened between tee and green. Was it good accuracy and approach play (Black) or a great sand escape (Red), or something else. But objectively, compared to the average player1, a player with a positive SGtee-to-green did something pretty good between tee and green. 1 Note that SGputting is also a comparison with the average player. 

This means that 66 - 2 - 1 = 63 penalties were missed. In the "Least Effective Penalty Takers" section of that page we see other cases were 9 penalties were missed since the final score was 2-1 after 12 penalties: 

I wonder if some open data source exists with all this data to do some mining, likewise for ATP & WTA) 

For this specific year 2017 we read in Wimbledon 2017 seeds revealed in full as Andy Murray secures top spot for the first time: 

The problem is that the bigger distance between hurdles makes it hard to combine with the typical 4-step and may make them need an extra, smaller step that would break speed. If we were to have a 110m (W) with similar spacing, it should be like: 

My interpretation is that technique and spacing became so standard that changing the distance would have made it a completely new competition, hence it was kept. Time passed and women's 100 metres hurdles appeared: 

TL;DR: 110 m was set for historical reasons and women had the distance set to 100 m to both use metric units and keep consistency with the number of hurdles run by men (10). 

It is not enough to test on the day of the competition, even if a 100% foolproof test for all illegal substances were possible. A doping athlete can use a drug during the training period leading up to competition, then stop use in time for any traces to disappear from the body before the test is taken. But the effects on the body (e.g. increased muscle mass) will remain longer, giving an unfair advantage. This is the reason that out-of-competetion testing is routinely carried out too, but this raises the problems of resources, of trusting local testing authorities, and of athlete rights and privacy, so it is very difficult to stop doping completely. Regarding the top 3 places testing, I seem to remember an anecdote of some cyclist in the Tour de France making certain to finish 4th on a day that he had taken a stimulant due to testing the 3 podium positions, and only racing 100% for stage wins on clean days. I'm not sure if this is a true story or not, but it reinforces the point: if dopers know when the tests are going to be taken they will find a way to cheat without getting caught. 

It has not been considered yet, as the general director of La Vuelta says, since there is the combination ranking which makes it add up to four classifications overall. Wikipedia in Spanish states: 

I assume this can be decomposed in multiple statistics, but let's focus on the main one: is the free throw percentage of a player higher when playing in their stadium? I found some nice statistics, but could not find any splitting in home/away: 

It is indeed interesting to note that many sports have 11 players per team: American football, field hockey, cricket... 

Unlike the other Grand Slams, Wimblendon's seeds have more elements into consideration together with the ranking. This is explained in Wimbledon's Seeds page:

I recall reading some time ago a rather inspiring and interesting story about the importance of rest while training for a sport. This specific story was about a runner in the 50s that was training very hard for a 5K or 10K Championship, probably the European Athletic Championships. Back in those days, stated the text I read, runners would train hard without interleaving some resting days. Apparently, the benefits of rest were undiscovered, so they assumed that the more your trained, the better the results would be. However, that specific athlete had some serious health problem about a month before the race, leading him to remain at bed for a couple of weeks. Obviously, he could not train in all this period and he was very concerned about losing all his fitness for the race. Despite this fear, the athlete decided to go and run the race, and then it became obvious that his fitness wasn't worse but way better: not even did he win the race, but he even lapped the rest of the runners (that is, they were more than 400 m after him). I remember reading this some years ago in a book, but cannot recall more than the details I already mentioned. Some may be even wrong (maybe it was not in the 50s and maybe it was another championship). Since I somehow assumed he as Finnish, I did some research on some long-distance runners like Paavo Nurmi, but nothing arose from that. Is this story true? Was there such situation? 

So why should this matter? Lets assume I am a bent coach*, out to make money from the bookmakers. The odds of a team will change with their form. So assume Team A (my team) are set to play team D next week, and that the teams are evenly matched. The odds for Team A to win will be about evens. We can assume that these are the "fair" odds. But before that match, Team A lose to Team B and Team C, as I deliberately made bad coaching decisions . Now the odds for playing Team D are suddenly longer, and I bet on my team to win. I have manipulated the odds in my favour, and stand to make money. *This is purely hypothetical. I have no reason to suspect that Pete Rose was "bent", or ever gave anything other than his best efforts. According to his wikipedia article he claims 

At least two Swiss Wrestling (Schwingen) competitions are held every 6 years. The Umspunnen-Schwinget in Interlaken is held every 6 years. The last events were in 1999, 2006 (the 2005 event was postponed due to rain) and 2011. The next event will be in 2017. The Kilchberger Schwinget is also held every 6 years, with the last events in 2008 and 2014, and the next to be held in 2020. It is interesting to note that the biggest event, the Eidgenössisches Schwing- und Älplerfest is held every 3 years. Schwingen is not an Olympic sport, so there is no need to synchronize with the Olympics, but it may be an advantage for local festivals to avoid clashing with the national festival.
