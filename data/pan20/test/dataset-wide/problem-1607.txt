However, these studies should be viewed in the wider context of the literature. For an overview of that research, here is a good place to start. To quote an especially relevant paragraph. Note that it seems to basically contradict the findings above: 

Note that in the available translation of the sermon itself the specific language of "infidels" or "apostates" is not used directly by Baghdadi himself, but arguably implied. EDIT: ISIS directly discusses "apostasy" in various statements included as an appendix a Brookings report. In these statements they explicitly label the following groups as apostate: "[t]hose worshiping—or perceived to be worshiping—stones, saints, tombs, etc.", Shia muslims, "sorcerers", "whoever participates in the political process", "whoever extends to the occupier and his supporters any kind of assistance", "whoever disparages [the] honored stature and position [of the Prophet or the Rightly Guided Caliphs]", "all the rulers and armies of these states [of unbelief]", etc. This falls short of literally labeling all Muslim non-supporters as apostates, but it comes fairly close because it is so open-ended. The only explicit limit they place is where they say "we do not believe in the unbelief of the generality of those entering [the political process], so long as legal proof has not [yet] been furnished for them." 

In another large cross-sectional research(1), scientists and researchers were able to prove that physical exercise is correlated with lower risk of depression, however, fortunately for people against physical exercise, they couldn't prove a causal link between the two, researchers said they:

If marriage was defined as a father selling his daughter for "three goats and a cow”, then it would be dowry, but searching for the term "three goats and a cow" on: 

The good news: it prevents it from dying. The bad news: it isn't the most effective (more like least effective). Gazelle, an eCommerce company, which lets people sell their used cell phones and pays consumers for used or broken electronic devices, performed a series of tests in a quest to find out the most effective way to fix a water-damaged cell phone. White rice (uncooked) was able to turn on a cellphone but it wasn't the most effective: cat litter, instant couscous, and open-air sponge, silica gel all performed better than uncooked white rice. 

There are searchable compilations of his writings on religion, like Mark Twain on Religion and The Bible According to Mark Twain. You can also search Twain's letters here and here. No dice. 

I won't address US defensive capabilities or attempt to conclusively answer the question, but here is some of the key information one would have to consider on the North Korean side. From a 2015 article on Ars Technica: 

This is going to be a pretty disappointing answer, but here are various data points that might help. (Given the bickering in the comments to the question, I'll use the term "Romani" and hope for the best!) 

More effort at pooling and analyzing case-control studies has since taken place. Here's an example from 2004: 

In 2005, James J. Krupa, an Associate Professor of Biology, asked 600 students from his biology classes at the University of Kentucky if throwing rice at weddings would be harmful. 45% percent of the students alleged it was unsafe mentioning exploding birds as the reason. Krupa realizing this a teaching opportunity had his students test the claim as a lesson on the scientific method. The students carried out a series of experiments on:

With no doubt, more research is actually needed before it's completely understood how cognitive reserve works to delay the onset of Alzheimer's disease. So answering your question: 

No, there is no evidence to support this conclusion. What Hersch's article actually suggests is that Al-Nusra may have produced sarin in Syria. It had support from Turkey and possibly Saudi Arabia, but not the United States. 

As explained in the article "What ISIS Really Wants" by Graeme Wood, ISIS supporters see Baghdadi as a legitimate caliph. This is a defining feature of ISIS. Muslims in general recognize that bay'ah to a legitimate caliph would be a fundamental duty. But only ISIS supporters (not even Al-Qaeda) believe that any legitimate caliphate has existed since (at least) the fall of the Ottoman sultanate. According to Wood, referring to a particular sermon by Baghdadi: 

The survey mentions no research about music in particular, but there are a few studies that address rap and rock music videos: 

Birth Certificate missing from the UK Government After Kaye received a birth certificate from Web Sheriff (see point above), he went to a United Kingdom court to attempt to verify the validity of the birth certificate. He was told by the UK government that they could not verify the authenticity of this certificate, but that he could request a copy of the certificate himself since birth certificates are public record. Kaye paid the processing fees and requested a copy of the Cruz's birth certificate. However, it was not found. He reported:

I don't feel qualified to say decisively that Karnad's statement is untrue, but I suspect he might be oversimplifying the technology transfer described by political scientist Jonah Blank in a Foreign Affairs piece from 2015: 

Intelligence may be a proxy for something else. At least one study from 2014 emphasizes sensitivity to feelings of disgust. Deppe et al. from 2015 argue that the more relevant variable is reliance on intuition over reflection. In sum, the data is far from conclusive. At best it suggests that the question of cognitive ability shaping political orientation is worth further exploration. 

=== Another survey from 2006 looks at how media portrayals of violence (in general, not in music specifically) impact violent behavior. Quoting from the abstract: 

Documents almost all pieces of evidence showing that there has been a genocide against West Papua civilians. The document also argues that: 

Those claims are actually true, since there is some evidence online suggesting that bilingualism may (and not will) slow Alzheimer's Progression. There is an academic article published by NIH in 2010 which has been cited by 144 other articles: Here is the abstract: 

The whole idea that prone masturbation is harmful started in 1998 when Dr. Lawrence I. Sank proposed a theory of sexual dysfunction called Traumatic Masturbatory Syndrome (TMS) (1) . In his journal article, Dr. Sank speculated that the habit of masturbating prone (while lying face down — tending to rub penis against your hand, the surface of the floor, bed, pillow, or whatever it is laying on, in order to ejaculate) was responsible for severe sexual problems, including anorgasmia (delayed orgasms) and erectile dysfunction, suffered by four men he examined. (1) According to Sank, once the four men abandoned prone masturbation and learned to masturbate in a supine position using their hands their masturbating prone habit, their anorgasmia and erectile dysfunction supposedly became a thing of the past (they were cured of their sexual dysfunction) (1) . Sank's theory isn't widely recognized in the medical community and it is not generally accepted, because: 

Results along these lines have been replicated in multiple studies. Here are quotes from the abstracts of a few relevant articles. Note that most but not all of these studies list Gerulf Rieger as an author. Published in Psychological Science, 2004: 

TL;DR: There is a lot of relevant research and the findings are complex. They neither strongly support nor deny the assertion that listening to certain music or watching certain music videos may contribute to violent behavior. === This book chapter from 2003 covers research on "violent music" as it relates to child and adolescent development. It covers a lot of relevant ground, and is worth reading if you really want a full picture of what the research does and doesn't show on this question. Here is an analysis that comes under the heading "Suicides and Shootings". [Emphasis added in all cases.]: 

At the end of the page, many preview pictures are found along with the picture you're skeptical about. 

Invisible color, size and distance According to Benjamin Radford (3) , who has conducted field research at Loch Ness looking for its reputed denizen, the video shows no creature color, size or distance: 

4. Lawyer does not indicate a profession in the UK It seems that the word lawyer is not used to describe a profession in the United Kingdom. It is usually describes people who understand the law but not necessarily are real lawyers. According to BBC UK: 

First, I want to stress the fact that there is difference between delaying and preventing. The articles I have read online claim that bilingualism may delay Alzheimer's progression.
