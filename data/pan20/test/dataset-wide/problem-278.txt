A mist or vapor Asking for the shape of an infinite body that isn't infinite is somewhat... definite. So we're trying to get as close to infinite as we can. The problem, of course, is that the body gets in the way of every other body in the world. What would be the difference between such a creature and a ring of impassible mountains restricting access to the rest of the infinite world, making the world definite? After all, you're going to encounter this creature quite literally 99.99% of the time, so one hopes it has legs so you can walk beneath it... but then there'd be no sun... Unless the creature is something more ethereal, something that can penetrate into every nook and cranny, extend from beneath the ground to the heights of the sky, something that people can walk through and still experience the entirety of this voluminous world. Something that smacks just a bit of atmosphere... Conclusion: the creature is a mist or vapor Which also means you don't need to worry about where it's mouth is so that people can hear it roar from anywhere and everywhere. 

DISCLAIMER: This answer is from the perspective of a happy couple living in the United States. There is a massive amount of variability in fertility, health care, etc. around the world. Absolutely massive. I'm (somewhat arrogantly) assuming that the U.S. has the capacity to detect such a problem first due to the combination of high tech levels and large population bases. Addressing this question beyond this perspective might (and likely does) make the question too broad. 

And this is from a first-world perspective. Your second- and third-world countries would hardly be affected at all. But, to give basis to my number, bear in mind that the estimated annual death rate is just under 1%. Let's call it 1%. 0.01/365 = 0.0027% daily death rate. Estimated losses world-wide in a week due to the outage: 1% In most of the world almost nothing would happen. In your first-world countries, most deaths would occur due to panic and crime, with a more-than-their-fair-share occuring to the Mormons since we're known to horde store food. But, to be honest, most people would simply lock themselves at home and wait it out. The real devestation would be economic because banks won't stop counting interest during those days but most companies would grind to a halt. No money in + money due out = bankruptcy. 

You'll notice that I'm not going to mention things like resources or land. Those may be what you wish to acquire or achieve as a result of a war, but it's not enough to sustain the violence you're looking for. Not even insult will do that. Once these things are obtained or resolved, all the determination to get them drains away. You need something much more lasting than a goal of any kind to sustain the violence you're looking for. So... what do you need? You need Belief Soldiers need to believe... I mean really believe. Believe in a way that's religious to the core even if religion isn't part of the process. They need to believe in the cause so much that they'll accept the damage they leave behind to risk damage to themselves in the hope that they'll damage their enemies. There's an old adage, "there are no athiests in foxholes." It's relatively easy to bring a religious fervor to the military (Frank Herbert's Dune depends on this concept). But it's not at home. You see, supporters at home need belief, too. They need to believe that the world after the war will be better than the world before the war. They need to believe they can survive the conflict and its consequences. But they have the luxury of asking themselves, "is all this worth it?" Especially when the soldier is getting 2-3 meals a day but the family isn't due to rationing. They go to church each week and hear the regular rabble-rousing sermon and begin to wonder, "is this what god really wants?" It's usually much harder to cause belief in your supporters than it is in your soldiers. You need Hate Anger dissolves over time. You need hate. You need to be sure that you see your enemy as something deserving of the fate they receive. That they are contemptible, even a stain on your existence. The Bosnian wars are an interesting example. The people in Yugoslavia lived for generations, even intermarrying between faith and ethnic groups, but when society finally broke down into war, very old hatreds came to the surface. Hate usually takes time, lots of time, to develop. But, if you hate your enemy, it's much simpler to treat them as pond-scum in need of wiping from the earth. Again, this is much harder among the supporters, but not as hard as belief. Oddly, it is natural for humans to hate. In fact, we need to train ourselves not to. We naturally see competitors for mates, resources, etc., as something to be overcome and that very easily becomes hate. Look at how many people today are searching for a cause. It's so bad that people will glom on to the dumbest things, just because there's this inner need wired into us from our days on the Savanah to fight against something... anything... Therefore, hate is much simpler than belief ... but it still takes time. So you need to have a backstory that explains where the hate comes from — especially for your supporters. You need Desperation Luxury is your enemy. Even with an intense hate, if you have luxury, hate becomes something you indulge, not something that drives you. Apartheid is a good example of hate being a luxury. White Africa wasn't driven to anything, they were not desperate, and so the violence was much more subtle and much more insidious. Take away the luxury and suddenly you have the fierceness of a cornered animal. There are a couple of things that will help with all this... You need to Control Information You can't let photos of the carnage get back home. When photography finally caught up with the U.S. Civil War, the images of carnage greatly affected the supporters, who became less supportive. Just as it is natural to hate, it is also natural to feel compassion. Those bodies represent some mother's children, some child's father, some country's hope for the future. This is at war with the hate in our souls. Natural, because we have compassion for our children, which is why we're fighting for mates and resources, etc. If you don't control information, you sow the seeds of war weariness. You need to Use Propaganda Here's an example of where Nazi Germany really shined. It was a propaganda machine. It kept its supporters controlled by feeding them a constant stream of success stories, heros, reasons to hate, and reasons to believe. It worked so well that by the time the Nazi's were in retreat their economy was an absolute and complete shambles — something that was getting noticed, but was largly ignored due to the success of the propaganda engine. With this combination of behaviors and activites you can, theoretically, consumate a war having the violence you describe. However, you should not undersell the fact that every rational creature's behavior (when thought of as the masses and not the individual) will naturally avoid war soon after it begins. A race that is genetically prone to the behavior you want would be quickly swept from the ecological balance as being too upsetting to the balance. Thus, your story really isn't about the violence. That's just the window dressing that underscores the real message. It's about how you corrupt natural behaviors to promote such activity. You're not the first to try to tackle this idea. You won't be the last. Just remember, it's not about the violence, it's about the message. It's about how you control your own people. 

If that's what you're looking for (and there are no examples that I'm aware of... granted my limited exposure to all of zoology.. of this happening in reality to any creature on earth), then... Starting with today's human, the body would need to extend above the rib bones such that space is made for the brain, jaw (which wouldn't work very well), and sinuses, thus the shoulders are above the brain and face. This extension is 100% required as all the other space is completely taken up by, well, the heart, lungs, kidneys, liver, stomach.... Shoulder bones would need to develop a rib-like and cranial-like structure to produce and protect the space needed below for the brain and face. It would be remarkably vulnerable and so would be, I assume, very thick, possibly developing a protective covering like finger and toe nails. If the spine is left in its current state, then the facial area could bend just as the chest cavity does. That's not condusive to protecting the brain and would be problematic for breathing. It's more likely the spine through the facial area would become more ridged (though it couldn't be perfectly ridged). Some bone or very hard cartilege would be needed to protect the brain from the front and to provide structure for the eyes and jaw. This would further stiffen this portion of the spine. Without a head, the only way this creature could see behind him would be by turning the entire body. Roughly speaking, 50% of the sweep of our eyes is the turn of the waist, the rest is the turn of the head. That would be lost. This creature would have horrible peripheral vision and be remarkably vulnerable to attack from behind. Lifting something above your shoulders would be very problematic. We tilt our heads back, which doesn't significantly shift our center of gravity. This creature would have to lean back, which does significantly shift center of gravity. My suspicion is that this creature would rarely lift anything more than a foot above the shoulders. Ears are a bit of a problem. They developed as they have on humans to give us "3-D hearing" or the ability to track where a noise is coming from. There's nowhere on the new body to do this with just two ears. If in front of the arms, you'd have trouble hearing what's behind you and vice-versa. That may incline evolution to develop four ears (two in front, two in back) up around the shoulder areas... but the ears are simply a problem with this design. Ear lobes aren't just decorative, they help capture and funnel noise. There's kindof nowhere to put them on a body of this design. That would mean ear holes like birds and lizards have, possibly orbiting the shoulder protective bone. Finally, and not to be too crude about it... female mammary glands would need to be someplace else. They're on the outside of humans because there's no space for them inside. The proposed body could perhaps be elongated just a bit more to accomodate them with nipples below the "chin." But, well, problematic. I suspect we'd need to ask a woman about the difficulty of not being able to bend her head down to look at a suckling child. That's enough description. In our understanding of evolution, what could produce such a creature? Nothing that I'm aware of, there are so many weaknesses to this design and so many strengths to what we have that I can't imagine anything that would allow such a creature to evolve. However, for the purpose of full disclosure, I'm not an evolutionary scientist... so someone else may know better than I. 

So, when it comes to converting immaterial energy to material matter, you need to use Clarkean Magic like Star Trek transporters, and ignore the fact that something sinister is actually going on. 

Fuel Value Steam fuel is remarkably inefficient. A pound of coal produces 10.1Kbtu of heat. A gallon of gasoline produces 146.5Kbtu of heat. (Source) A gallon is 231 cubic inches. Coal density changes its volume substantially, but an average value appears to be 55Lbs/cu.ft, which means there are 7.35 lbs in 231 cubic inches for 74.24Kbtu of heat. 

And here's the second thing we need: to replace binary computing with something more valuable. Transistors made binary computing an easy path, but what if someone has the foresight to see what computing could become? Now that we have small, fast, efficient glarrys, we need to build a computer based on decimal math rather than binary math....
