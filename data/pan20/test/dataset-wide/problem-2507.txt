Just know that you felt something or noticed something into your five senses.for an example if you feel amgry just know that your are feeling angry. And then automatically you will give up that feeling(anger). Like that we should have a good comprehension about what we feel and notice into senses. In short just be aware of five senses. You do not want to spare a special time and do that,but just do your day to day activities with a good comprehension and awareness. In other words do them conciously.If you do so you do not want to waste your time on those meditations that are taught everywhere. 

Yes!what Lord Buddha taught is to give up your ego. Ego is the destroyer of ypur path to nirvana. Ego will ruin everything.but we cling to our ego and that vagues our path to understand what is life and nirvana. 

No one can declare that one cannot say he/she has achieved nirvana. Didn't lord Buddha declare that he achieved nibbana? If some one has achieved nirvana don't he/she has to declare it to others in order to teach them about the correct path to nirvana? If you say 'no', then how can he/she guide others to the nirvana? Thus it will depend on the person whether to declare it on public or not. No one can thoroughly say 'no'. 

Don't stress yourself trying to do those meditations uselessly. Just try out this: you just focus on your day to day activities with a good comprehension and awareness. In short be concious when doing things. That inhaling -exhaling meditation is just a basic and elememtry meditation which was taught for beginners. Just try iut what i explained. 

Why desiring to be a man? Just don't underestimate your womanhood like that. Just empower yourself and give a value to yourself. Society will say so many things.but who will give a damn? Just don't care what others say about women. Being a woman i thought in the same way now you are thinking.but it's some time ago and now I know the value and the importance of being a woman. Don't attribute such a value and an importance to men. No matter what your gender is if you are doing it right it will be the best. Those good notions of being a man have created by this patriarchal society.And we women should subotage those stupid values that make the women unimportant and miserable creatures. 

What this really about is anger management. Every time we let ourselves to get carried away by anger we end up doing/saying stupid things and then regretting it later. So being able to control anger and (verbal or actual) violence based on anger is beneficial to us and to others. 

is a standard phrase that means "I undertake the training rule to abstain from ..." The key therefore is , or, parsed out, . is usually translated as "sexual" and as "misconduct". Such a translation, however, is severely misreading a simple literal phrase. , the antonym of , generally means "wrong", "low quality", "sloppy" and literally "opposite", "contrary". means "conduct", or literally "going about", "walking". So far so good. , the root of , is often translated "lust" or "sensual pleasure" but its more precise meaning is fondness (combining such elements as love, desire, and taking pleasure in) for an object of material senses -- in other words "sensual fondness" -- not sexual but sensual! The key to understanding this phrase though is in , which gives it the meaning of "out of". Together, the phrase reads "Misbehaving out of sensual fondness" (or "Going astray out of ..."). This gives it a very different meaning than "sexual misconduct". The idea is, when one's mind is obsessed by an object of sensual pleasure, one's ability to reason about results and side-effects of one's acts gets severely impaired. One is then prone to making bad decisions, creating suffering for oneself and others. Instead, one should never act out of mere "sensual fondness"! One should act out of right understanding, out of compassion etc. 

Generally speaking Kaguypas seem to prefer to stay away from philosophical discussions and focus on practice, which makes sense given their self-identification as "the practice lineage": 

What is beginner's mind? Beginner's mind is obviously not actual beginner's mind, it is the clarity you get when you let the dust settle down either through meditation or by creating some distance between yourself and the situation. It is when you are not bogged down with too many details, perspectives and ambiguities but see the configuration of the situation with clarity. The difference between the two. The two are related, in both cases we talk about experience or perception. But the contexts are different, in case of Direct Seeing we are talking about someone starting with conceptual map and then finally "getting it" for real. While in the case of Beginner's Mind we are talking about someone starting with ambiguous experience and then attaining clarity. The end result is the same but the starting points are different. I don't think you put effort into Beginner's Mind. It comes by itself as a result of not proliferating the intoxication, not feeding the fire, the dust settling, the distance growing or whatever other metaphors you want to use. It's the effort of not-doing, not the effort of doing. Direct seeing on the other hand does require effort. This effort is known as Vipassana or Inquiry or Insight into your direct experience, guided by the conceptual map of Dharma. 

So to start with, we need separate "pro-life" (in the sense of being opposed to abortion) and "pro-choice" (in the sense of believing the state should restrict it). There are certainly Buddhists who are both pro-choice and anti-choice regardless of whether they are also "pro-life." It is widely recognized in a variety of sources that, in the traditional Buddhist sources, the ensoulment occurs at conception. Bhikkhu Bodhi mentions in the book In the Buddha's Words that consciousness (or perhaps more precisely viññāṇa) begins "from the moment of conception," though I don't know where precisely in the texts this is defined to be the case. We see that this translates to a "pro-life" and sometimes "anti-choice" attitude in the Theravada countries. Sri Lanka allows abortion to preserve the life of the woman but not for any other reason. Myanmar is similar. Thailand is slightly more permissive–especially since it allows for health of the mother under some circumstances and includes mental health–while still generally banning it. In Peter Harvey's An Introduction to Buddhist Ethics we see analysis that indicates that: 

This is one of those questions that is complicated by that in the United States the conversation around abortion looks and feels very different than it does from other countries in the world. It is also made complex by the interaction of the ideology and the "situation on the ground," where things are usually quite complicated. To quote Karma Lekshe Tsomo's excellent article Prolife, Prochoice: Buddhism and Reproductive Ethics: 

In Japan (and Korea per Harvey) it is much, much less restricted and the Japanese Buddhists are much more accepting of it. This was examined in the book Liquid Life: Abortion and Buddhism and Japan. It is notable that both US Buddhists and Japanese Buddhists tend to be much less opposed to abortion than other Buddhist groups. This issue is explored further in Michael G. Barnhart's Buddhism and the Morality of Abortion, which notes that: 

The short answer is "yes, historically, though it is generally frowned upon by many if not most modern Buddhists." I'm trying to find better citations than the ones than I am digging up immediately, but the best sources for this don't appear to be readily available online (or require more reading through to figure out what is being referred to). If anyone has some better references I'd love to see them, since mostly what I am finding are three or four pieces that reference one another. Regardless, moving on to the actual answer: In older texts you see a lot of references to what is probably Datura (certainly in some cases, likely in others) in early Buddhist magical texts and in a lot of precursors/early forms of Vajrayana. Ronald M. Davidson's Indian Esoteric Buddhism, for example: 

In my understanding, the way it works, ignorance (confusion/delusion/bewilderment) is the root of idealizing (hence attachment, attraction, obsession) and demonizing (hence aversion, hatred, negativity) - and then these two manifest as craving to either get some experience, or to get rid of some experience - which, when not satisfied, generates dukkha (the painful feeling of wrongness) due to the mismatch between "this" and the craved "that". A better translation of "ignorance" IMO is confusion or delusion - it's not just an absence of knowledge (that would only be half as bad) -- but an active presence of invalid knowledge, or invalid assumptions based on partial knowledge. What does this invalid knowledge pertain to? At most basic level, it pertains to (confusion about) real qualities of the object of our experience - on the basis of which then happens idealization or demonization. More generally, it pertains to the way objective and subjective reality gets mixed up. Most of what we perceive as reality is projection of mind. (This mind itself is a function of interactions and not an entity nor essence.) Based on this confusion we posit all kinds of naive assumptions about reality, from existence of entities, to identification with living organism, to appropriation of various views, values and goals. This identification with living organism and resulting taking of sides is said to perpetuate alienation, fear, conflicts, and suffering -- which only perpetuates alienation. Even more generally, it pertains to not-seeing inherent limits of mind's modeling capabilities - which leads to invalid expectation that mind's models can ever be accurate representations of reality - which leads to trouble and suffering. In light of the above, the only way to prevent or minimize suffering is to A) stay actively aware of the limited extent to which models can represent some aspects of reality; B) not hold onto outdated models as reality moves on -- but try to update and keep the models in sync with reality as much as possible; C) avoid reification falacy - instead pick a model as tool that better suits the job at hand - but also try to rely on nondiscrete holistic multi-faceted observation more than on the simplistic conceptual designations; and finally D) remember that no matter what we do we'll still have to rely on models at least to some extent - and as such they can never be 100% complete and in sync. 

It's not desire that leads to pleasure, it is ("good") action that does. Desire in and of itself is blind, it just wants, craves. Desire does not always translate into good action. Instead, 1) There could be passive frustrating hopeless desire. 2) There could be blind desire that makes you act in self-destructing ways. So desire for pleasure could very well lead to suffering. Either (1) suffering of frustrating hopeless desire, or (2) suffering of a bad side-effects of careless action. What leads to pleasure is "good" action. Good action is action that not only creates short-term pleasure, but creates indirect/latent causes for more pleasure and peace and harmony in the long-run! Good action is strategic! What's wrong with desire for pleasure? Desire for pleasure is not strategic. Desire for pleasure tends to be either short-sighted or careless in terms of side-effects. Now, you could ask, how can there be action without desire? Very simple! It is action informed by education, or right understanding, or shame, or honor, or fear etc. Not all action comes from desire. Finally, you should understand that in Buddhism pleasure is seen as inherently short-term and prone to side-effects, so per Buddhism the better goal is "peace" or "harmony". Therefore in Buddhism we say that right action, the one that comes from right understanding, leads to peace and harmony.
