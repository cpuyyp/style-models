Watching the 2013 Australia Vs England Test series ("The Ashes"), I have seen for the first time an interesting piece of technology which shows the rotation speed of the ball. This is used when spinners are bowling, to give viewers an idea how much each ball is spinning (so you can see if it was an arm ball, stock ball, big turner etc). This is called the 'rev counter'. Does anyone know, preferably with a reference, what technology this is based on? I would presume some kind of microwave doppler radar, but it seems like a very tricky thing to implement. I don't think it is a high speed camera as the results are obtained almost instantly once the delivery is bowled (as per the speed camera results, which do use a microwave doppler radar). 

I have played regular cricket for a number of years but am now not able to spend the many hours required on weekends to play. I have instead taken up indoor cricket. To be specific, this is the standard form of indoor cricket that originated in Australia, but is now played in a number of countries. Full details of the rules etc can be found here. I have been a decent bowler in outdoor cricket bowling line and length medium pace outswingers with an inswinger and off and leg cutters as variations (the leg cutter also functions as a slower ball). When bowling in indoor cricket though, I am getting worse results than players who on the face of it appear to be much worse bowlers. Clearly I am not adapting my game to the different requirements of indoor cricket. I tend to get driven to the back fence a lot. Can anyone outline the approach to take when bowling in indoor cricket, given the type of bowler I have been in outdoor cricket? 

I have played table tennis professionally at college level and I never bothered about these stats. These stats do not follow a common standard. I assume that they are put up by the manufacturer as a simple indication of whether the rubber/blade is more suited for the players style of play (offensive/defensive). Professionally, players do not a buy a single racket and use it like they do in tennis. they buy the blade and rubbers separately and match them to suit their style. Fully assembled rackets are usually used by amateurs and semi-professional players. So, to clear your confusion over the price and performance of a racket, it really doesn't matter. If you are going to buy a racket, I would suggest you to try it before you buy it. 

It is perfectly legal in table tennis to change the racket to other hand during a point. Though uncommon and extremely difficult, it does provide a few exciting moments for the spectators. ITTF has compiled a video capturing these exciting moments. And if it is legal for a point, it should be legal for a set and a match as well. 

Since this is your custom tournament and the participants are your friends, you can afford to experiment with the rules. My suggestion would be to start off with this, and whenever you find it biased in some way, just make a few rules changes and proceed. Without having a trial run, you will not be able to find out the drawbacks, and you may also find that the frequency of participation will require you to change the values of the system to give everyone a fair chance. One thing that I would like to point out is that you will need additional rules to accommodate a participant who joins the tournament after it had started. With that in place, give this system a run and see how it goes. 

Whenever a team has less than 5 riders to compete in the TTT, the time of the final rider counts. I do not have an official source, but this question has been asked quite often over the past few days and this was the answer provided every time. Furthermore, I believe, but I'm not 100% sure, when one or more of these riders finish out of time, the other riders will get the time of the last rider to finish in time. 

In preparation of international tournaments like the World Hockey League, Champions Trophy, World Championships or the Olympic Games, the Dutch women's field hockey team played several friendlies against male teams. 

Most points for the mountain classification Most first places at Hors Categorie climbs Most first places at first categorie climbs And so on... If both riders have finished first on the exact same distribution of mountains. That is, there is still no decisive winner. The rider that has best general classification wins the mountain jersey. 

I am no athletics trainer whatsoever, so this is from my personal experience as a footballer who only occasionally takes part in a run. In the next few days, train only on short distances with high pace. That can be anything from 1 km at full pace to a 5 km with intervals. Running anything more than 5 km makes no sense anymore. Your stamina is fine and should be the basis of a good performance. Train until two days before the race, after that, only a bit of jogging (low pace, small distance) if you feel like to. You should not feel anything from training activities on the day of the race. During the race, I think that you're best shot is to use your endurance training in your favor. So, try to get the pace up right from the beginning. Force the "sprinters" to put in enough effort right from the start to prevent them from getting a slow first kilometer and getting beat in a ferocious final kilometer.
