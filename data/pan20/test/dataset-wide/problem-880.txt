Hands down it's Jupiter. It has both the largest radius and faster rotational velocity of the planets, and smaller objects will not be able to compete with that huge radius. Jupiter's rotational velocity is approximately 13.4 km/s (with some variation due to wind currents, as it is a gas), which can be determined both from Doppler shifts of reflected sunlight, and also from watching the motion of equatorial cloud features. Saturn is only 10.9 km/s, as it has a longer rotation period and a smaller radius. None of the other planets can compete with Jupiter, and smaller objects would need prohibitively short rotation periods to have any chance. For example, the Earth would need to have a day that was about half an hour long to compete with Jupiter. Even a molecule that spins millions of times a second would need a size on the order of a cm to compete with Jupiter. 

No, those are two different nebulae. There are stars in our galaxy much older than 5.6 billion years. The problem is that "nebula" is a very generic term, so it can be a whole galaxy or even the remains of a single star. It's not even clear what is meant by the nebula from which our Sun formed, it could be the giant molecular cloud if our Sun formed in a huge cluster, or it could be something called a "proplyd" (which is much smaller) if the Sun formed in relative isolation. There are even proplyds that break off from giant molecular clouds in a kind of combined scenario where the GMC forms the proplyd and then the proplyd forms the star. In any event, it is important to realize that the galaxy formed from a huge nebula some 10 billion years ago, and the Sun formed from a much smaller nebula much later. 

Another point to bear in mind is that very few topics in astronomy are "important" in any kind of absolute or demonstrable way, astronomy is more or less the study of all the things that don't directly affect us (with a few exceptions that no longer motivate or justify astronomy). Instead, one of the most important reasons to do astronomy is to create a sense of place, a sense of where we stand in the grand scheme-- it is the way astronomy gives us a context we can't get from anything else. So I think discovery of life elsewhere would have a transformative effect in that respect, because it would change how we understand our own story. By that I mean, right now we really don't even know if we are looking for a story of life on Earth that sounds like a spectacularly unlikely sequence of events that could only occur on one planet in a trillion, or if we are looking for a common, even inevitable, story that happens almost everywhere. And there is no way we could ever know which story we are looking for by looking only at life on Earth. No study of evolution, no study of the history of our weather, no understanding of the reasons for mass extinctions or even if mass extinctions require any reason beyond chance fluctuations, could ever really tell us if the story we are telling about our own appearance on this planet is a common or inevitable kind of story, or a spectacularly unlikely story that could only play out at all in a truly vast universe. So that's one of the most important elements of discovering life elsewhere, to understand the nature of life itself, including our own. It's the sense of context that astronomy provides. 

I actually think you are supposed to assume the solar sail is unfurled while the spaceship is still quite far from the red giant (despite "too close"), because otherwise the problem is extremely difficult. At least if you are far from the red giant, you can assume all the light is incident along the normal to the sail, and if it's a mirror, it will also reflect back the same way. In that situation (only), you can simply take the radiative flux density (L / 4pi D^2), divide by c (to get a momentum flux), multiply by the area A, and double it (to account for straight-back reflection), resulting in an expression that is like zephyr's except without the 1/3 (which comes from assuming we are only talking about one instant and it is right at the surface of a blackbody with no limb darkening, none of which we should expect from a red giant), and my expression also has a 1/D^2 which is actually important in what follows. The reason I think this is what is intended is because only then is D not essential to treat in detail. It then becomes easy to figure out what the area of the sail needs to be, we can do it with energy considerations. At large D, the radiative force will be a constant multiple of the gravity, and that multiple needs to be "2" in order to get the spaceship to go back to infinity where it came from (assuming either the original speed at infinity was small, or that your goal is to return so whatever that original speed was, as these are the only ways you don't need to know that original speed). The gravitational force is GMm/D^2, so P times A needs to be twice that, where P is given above. The answer comes out A = 4pi G M m c / L, which is independent of the D where the sail is unfurled. The reason it's much harder if you don't make D large is that the incident flux is not along the normal any more, so you need an r-dependent factor that ranges from 1/3 right at the surface, to 1 farther out. You'd have to integrate the role of that factor to get the necessary A, whereas my answer doesn't need any of that. What's more, if you unfurl the sail right at the surface, the spacecraft will enter the star, and the radiative environment becomes even more complicated, not to mention possibly destroying the spacecraft. So I don't think any of those expressions are what you want, because you can't just get the force at the surface, you need to know the force that would succeed in getting the spacecraft to turn around, so it must exceed gravity by a factor that would be very hard to compute unless you take D large. 

One important concept that has not been mentioned yet is the "cosmological principle." This is the key simplifying idea for our cosmological models, it says that the universe is the same everywhere on the largest scales at a given age, so alien astronomers 50 billion light years from us that also conclude the universe is 13.8 billion years old will be observing pretty much all the same things we are. This principle is not proven by data, but the data is consistent with it, most notably the Hubble law and the homogeneity of the cosmic microwave background. It allows us to understand the past of our own part of the universe by seeing the past of distant parts (a constraint we are stuck with given the speed of light). So that's why a universe model that is finite in size must curve back on itself-- nothing else would satisfy the cosmological principle. This doesn't mean the principle is true, it means we are not going to part with it unless we have to. 

Yes, it's considered to be spatially flat on the largest scales we can observe, but we must remember that scientific measurements come with uncertainties, and our models can be replaced by better ones. At the present time, we have observations that say the universe is spatially flat to within a high degree of accuracy, but there is still some wiggle room there for it to be slightly curved that we cannot rule out. Also, we can only observe the part of the universe we can see, we cannot know that the rest of the universe has the same curvature as our portion does. We have a theoretical understanding that it would be very difficult for the universe to be close to flat, without being extremely close to flat, so we expect it is extremely close to flat. But theories can be replaced and usually are, and even if the theoretical expectation continues to pass tests way into the future, we still can never know the universe is exactly flat. But the bottom line is, we have both very good observations, and a good theory (the theory of inflation, and the fact that flatness is unstable with age under general relativity), that agree the universe on the largest scales we can observe is very close to spatially flat. Hence, we can create a model in which is it is flat, and use that model successfully. That's all you ever get in science. 

The situation doesn't even require general relativity, the same thing can happen with ants crawling on a rubber picnic sheet. Imagine you are sitting in the center of a very stretchy rubber sheet, and ants are crawling toward you at ant-speed from the outer edges of the sheet. You ask some friends to keep pulling the edges of the sheet away from you at a speed somewhat faster than ants can crawl. Will that protect you from the ants? No, believe it or not, the ants will still reach you. At first they are getting farther from you, but if you mark gridlines on that sheet, you'll see the ants are still advancing across those gridlines all the same. They get to you eventually, just like the light from a galaxy whose distance from us is increasing faster than c. Note the second quote is not about the speed at the edge of the sheet, it says the ants don't get to you if all the points on the sheet that the ants access are all moving away from you faster than ant-speed. That's a very different situation. 

What the Hubble constant really depends on is how old was the universe at the time, but if you have a dynamical model of the universe, you can map that into z and come up with a function H(z). So in that sense, the answer is "yes," but be careful-- we also think of z as a measure of how far away the objects are, and H does not depend on location it depends on age. What's more, the z we get from a given measurement reflects all the expansion, so all the H's, since that light was emitted, not just the value of that H at that z. It would be a bit like if you were using your height to talk about your age, and you look at a picture of yourself at 4 feet tall, and say you were growing two inches a year when you were that tall. That would be like the H that applies in that picture, but the ratio of the height you are now to the height in that picture depends on more than just the rate you were growing in that picture. (Also-- what do you mean the value of the Hubble constant is 0.7 now? That sounds like the fraction of total energy that is "dark energy," so is more about the rate of acceleration of the expansion rather than the rate of expansion itself. If you are asking about that, then this number has been rising with age of the universe, so can be mapped into a function of z if we are using z to talk about the age of the universe at the time.) 

It's a bit subtle, the key thing the partial ionization does is to keep the temperature from changing much. What you really want is an increase in density, not temperature. The reason the kappa mechanism is important is that it allows heat to be added to the gas when it is compressed, and removed when the gas is expanded, that's what allows for the pulsation to have energy added to it. Heat is added when the opacity is high, and removed when low, so you need the opacity to go up when the gas is compressed, and go down when the gas is expanded. Now, normally opacity goes down when gas is compressed, because the rise in temperature causes ionization, which actually hurts metal opacity by reducing the number of bound electrons (metal electrons have higher opacity in general when bound, due to resonances, than when free, though the hydrogen and helium we had in the Big Bang are an exception that works the other way-- in a star, it is usually metal opacity that is important and variable). But increases in density also tend to produce more bound metal electrons, so there's a competition there that temperature usually wins and stars are pulsationally stable. But in partial ionization zones, temperature changes are reduced by the phase changes eating up the excess energy, and that gives the density increase the edge that allows opacity to rise when the gas is compressed.
