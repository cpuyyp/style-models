Wearing a watch in general does have ramifications - you are perceived as more professional and caring about time (even though the watchless could use their phones) and you look at your phone less, giving people less opportunities to think you're checking for messages when it was just a time check. But the way that watch displays time to you is purely a matter of taste. Some will judge you for it, as they will judge for your shoes or your haircut. Don't sweat it though, it's really not a big deal at all. 

First, understand that 4 hours a week is a lot. That is 26 days a year. That's 5 weeks worth of time. You probably don't really need that much. So don't feel bad that you don't get to it every week. Second, goals like "spend 4 hours a week on research" are really hard to meet. Instead, work on having goals that are crisper. For example "move to the new version of [tool we use] within [x weeks] of release" or "never be more than [x releases] behind the latest on [library we use]" are simpler to measure, and carry their benefit right in the goal statement so everyone knows why you might need to do that. You can also have "try one new tool or library every month" and other slightly more open goals. Third, a goal ignored is time not spent. I presume you're doing something at least semi-agile so every two weeks or so there's some sort of meeting, either looking back over what's just been done or looking ahead and deciding what to do. As part of those meetings, you can checkpoint against the goals. What's been released or announced? Are you using the latest version? If not, who will be getting you there now? What tool or library is each person going to try this month? How did things go trying whatever you each tried last month? These checkpoints that already exist may provide all the structure you need, but if not, you can add a Lunch-and-Learn or similar peer-to-peer presentation. For example, if Jo tries out the new library and it's just not ready at all, a 20 minute presentation showing how, despite the buzz and hype when it was announced, it has nothing to handle [something important to your team] will let everyone know they're not missing an opportunity by not moving to that library. Then if Sue has been experimenting with a new technique and getting great results, a 20 minute presentation to at least show off the results (and perhaps start to teach the technique) will encourage everyone to learn it. The usual bribe for the lunch-and-learn is that the company orders pizza or some other hot food. If after 6 months of crisper goals, including these goals in planning and retrospective meetings, and holding peer-to-peer presentations, people are still not learning new things and you feel that you are missing some important innovations as a result, it will be time to spend money. Pluralsight subscriptions for everyone, and encourage them to use the offline viewers during their commutes. Start sending people to conferences - it punches a one-week hole in the schedule and ensures lots of opportunities to learn new things. Hire another person and lower everyone's billable hour target a little. The cost for these things should be justifiable by the gap between developer's knowledge and what they could have learned by now. 

The more complete your statement is, the less likely people will ask nosy questions. You don't want to close with "if there's anything else you want to know just swing by and ask me." This isn't a chit-chat topic. 

The thing is, what's annoying is not that they were lazy or ill informed or couldn't be bothered to get the info they needed. It's that they interrupted you to get it. Focus on that. And don't with-hold the answer as a way of punishing them, even if you're the boss. That's a great way to make people hate you. Also don't give passive-aggressive answers like "page 53 of [document]" when you're asked a question that has a one-word answer. It might make you feel better for a moment, but it won't actually turn them into people who look things up. 

If you honestly believe that, then either you work in a horrible place, and should look for another job as soon as you can, or you completely misunderstand when people explain politics to you, and you should refrain at all costs from providing your opinion to the people who decide about promotions in your company. Let me see if I can rewrite the sentence to match reality: 

One of those three will get you where you need to be. Since you haven't told us anything about your relationship, or what L is, it's hard to know how you might do #1. You need to say something to P like: 

Here's the problem with being honest in an exit interview: any given fact can be interpreted in at least two ways, and the circumstances of an exit interview (you're leaving and have in effect said you don't like working there any more or aren't up to working there any more) can sway your CEO to use the interpretation that will not achieve your wants (an easier life for your colleagues) and may hurt you in future. This is true whether you make entirely neutral fact based statements, or provide value judgements and give opinions. Example: "I was really overworked" or "deadlines were routinely set too tight" or "[person] did not manage our team deadlines well." You think you're giving important information about process and expectations. But it's easier to interpret as "Marche101 wasn't able to work at the pace we require." Eventually, when a steady stream of people who appeared in the hiring interviews to be able to work at an industry-appropriate pace continue to leave and make the same claim in their exit interviews, the other interpretation will kind of force itself on the CEO. But you have no idea how long that will take and in the meantime, the CEO remembers you as the one who couldn't work at an appropriate pace. So is there no room for honesty? Some would say no. I would say to sow a seed for the day the CEO is ready. So don't draw conclusions or offer advice, or say any sentences that start with I. If you can, don't offer anything until you are asked. Some exit interviews will ask "is there someone here that you had particular trouble working with?" or "if you could have changed one thing about this job, what would it be and would that have been enough for you to stay?" Rarely do they ask "why are you leaving?" directly. If you're not asked a specific question, just for "any advice or things you'd like us to know?" you really need to tread carefully. Perhaps "the work pace leading up to deadlines is not what it is in other firms" or "the process around scheduling here is unusual and I'm not sure it's the best it could be." A CEO who is interested and wants to make things better will ask more questions; one who has written you off already will thank you for sharing and move on to the next item on the exit interview checklist. By not saying anything super memorable before you know it will be well-received, you lower the chances of leaving a bad impression. 

That doesn't help me at all. Similarly, meta-stuff about how the recruiter deceived you doesn't help me either. Something like this might be good: 

I always keep in mind that there may be many people with the same name, and that the person I find in a search may not be the person who is applying to me. I have never voted "hire" or "no hire" simply because of something I found from a search. It has been fodder for interview questions though. And none of this is new - we used to search for what people were posting on usenet newsgroups, 20 years ago, for just the same reasons. 

In an interview, take advantage of the fact that you are not filling out a form online, or writing up a resume to a strict format. You are talking to a human. So answer in an honest, complete, and useful way. For example 

When I hire people, I do ask them to set their salary. "What do you want to be paid?" I ask them. Only if they refuse to name a number (having believed those people who claim the first to say a number "loses") do I offer one. [Do I always pay people what they want? Well, I don't always hire them, and wanting far more than what they are worth to me is one reason I might not.] Then once aboard, I tell them, "I want you to be happy and that includes with your pay. I will give you regular reviews and raises, but any time you feel you are not being paid properly, come and tell me and we'll see what we can do about it." In operation, what we can do about it is often "I see. Well to pay you that, I need you to X, Y, and Z consistently. Do you think you can get to that in 3 months? Let's meet then and confirm you have, and we'll raise your pay." The major downside to this is that employees rarely believe their employers genuinely want them to be happy and want to retain them. They believe the employer is trying to pay them as little as possible and that any statements about wanting to be nice are a trick to get the employee to relax and accept less than they are worth. They worry about "leaving money on the table" and being bad negotiators. This is most strong with new hires, who don't know anything about you and have no reason to trust you. If you wanted to implement an approach like this, you would need to "walk the walk" in a lot of other aspects (training, office d√©cor, upgrading hardware and software, flex hours, etc etc) so that people come to understand "this company is built on us and when we love our jobs, the owners make money, therefore the owners work at ensuring we love our jobs." There are people who will never set aside an adversarial mindset. The good news is your company improves when they leave. 

In my opinion, one too-personal piece of advice is too soon to tell the person not to discuss these topics with you further. I'm sure you reacted in the moment with a grimace or blush or some other involuntary indication that you didn't want this advice. Coming back to the topic now to say not to discuss that with you will have the opposite effect of what you want, increasing your coworker's interest and curiosity. I think you need to distinguish between questions and advice. You (unlike some other folks who ask about overly personal conversations at work) don't mind "how long have you been dating this person?" you just don't care for "oh my goodness in that case you should be married!" The great thing about this advice is that you're under no obligation to accept it or, and people sometimes don't realize this, to refute it. Her opinion doesn't matter to you, so you don't need to change it. This means that you don't need to rein yourself in at work if you don't want to. Had a great weekend with the boyfriend and feel like chatting about it? Go ahead. Maybe the coworker will offer unsolicited advice. So what? You can smile and carry on as though nothing was said. Or you can say "believe me Mary, I know you think we should be married already." It doesn't matter because she can't actually make you get married or break up. 

Don't assume people go to the links because you provide them. Include vital information (what you did; something about the employer such as "5 star hotel in downtown Toronto" or "busy accounting practice" or "nationally-known legal firm") in the description, just as you would without the link. The idea is that if someone wants to really drill in (you say that restaurant is fine dining, but what was on their menu? You say that law firm was known for its defense of celebrities, but let's see some press coverage) as part of a screening process, they can. The confidence you project by including this information is non-trivial, by the way. 

I take the hour (or two or three) a day that would be spent commuting and use it to connect to other people in my field. Not other telecommuters, I don't care where and how they work, but other developers in the languages and technologies I use. That's partly online (twitter, SO, my blog, ...) and partly real life - user groups, conferences, etc. If there is no local user group for whatever it is you do, maybe you could start one? These things fill the need for friends to chat to (and it isn't all shop talk) and can provide amazing career growth too - you'll get better at your job and meet a lot of people in your field. 

For women specifically you have an issue that men do not have. Men have a spectrum of clothing available to them that looks something like this: 

I would be vaguest with Charlie because you haven't reported anything about what he has said or done. Chances are he will send you to Andy (because he has the problem) or Bob (if he's actually your boss.) So tempting as it may be, don't start with the most senioe person. Start with the ones who have told you your performance is not what it should be. Whoever you talk to, whoever agrees to talk to you, ask them to please help you to do better. And listen carefully to what they tell you. They probably won't tell you again. While you may be scared to hear a big list of complaints, not hearing it won't keep them from acting on it. Your only chance to turn this around is to know what they care about and what they think is a problem. 

I wonder what choice you're trying to make? Is it "should I practice this one more time to be sure I cover everything I need to without making use of notes?" or "should I just leave my notes behind and pray I don't forget anything?" If it's the second one, keep rehearsing if you can. Whatever minor objection note-consulting might bring up in some people, it pales next to blowing your talk completely, forgetting important points, going twice or half the length you should, talking for 20 minutes to one slide and then discovering the next three slides had all the details you just said, and so on. Be prepared. Now, if you are prepared but are hoping for the comfort of notes just in case, that's a different story. In general, to be seen looking at your notes might cause some people to think you didn't practice or prepare enough. This isn't necessarily unprofessional - a quick debriefing with my colleagues after a business trip isn't something I rehearse, and a few notes on a piece of paper will ensure I cover all I need to. But if I've been asked to do a presentation, I should be "off book" or at least appear to be. Power point has a presentation mode that puts your whole slide on one screen (the projector), and the slide, its notes, and thumbnails of upcoming slides on another (your laptop). Glancing here will generally not look like consulting your notes. It's very helpful when I have an eight hour presentation to give for which people paid money. I need to be sure I do things in the right order, and with a large volume of material a few cues are helpful, but I don't want attendees thinking they paid for something that was under-rehearsed and ill-prepared - especially when it's not! To guauge the tone for the presentation you're worrying about, observe what happens when other people do the same kind of presentation. Do they visibly look at notes? If they do, glance around at the audience and see if anybody reacts at all. Figure out what the norm is for these events. By the way if you do use separate paper notes, either use a large font and lay the note on the desk or use an index card. An 8.5 x 11 sheet of paper in your hand will dramatically multiply any trembling from nerves, and make people think you are far more nervous than you are. True confidence comes from practice, but the appearance of confidence is something you can slip on just like a suit jacket.
