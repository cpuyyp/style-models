Due to US NRC standards, all Nuclear Power Plants include a containment vessel so the only way for them to spew toxic clouds would be for them to explode much like happened in Fukushima. So In the event of an EMP would we have nearly all of the active plants melting down and exploding? 

My question is: Is this an accurate statement that the government literally goes through schools and takes children to use as forced labor harvesting cotton? 

In an article from the National Journal released and linked to from the Drudge Report today(28MAR2014), Peter Pry, "a former CIA officer and head of a congressional advisory board on national security" claimed that a single EMP that is large enough to take out the power grid in the US would result in(among other things): 

In the White Collar TV Episode Bottlenecked it was claimed that a test of all vintage wines bottled before the ABomb would not contain any Cesium-137 but wine bottled in the years since all contain detectable amounts of Cesium-137. A search shows this could be plausible. But none of the sites I have found that explore this trope cite any reputable references for there claims of true. I can understand that if it is present that then you can say that the wine is not pre 1940's but is there any proof that the Cesium shows up in all wine bottled since? The EPA site says that: 

During a Press release today Senators Inhofe and Lucas accused the Department of Homeland Security of "limiting whatâ€™s available in the market with federal agencies purchasing unnecessary stockpiles of ammunition." Source Is there any evidence that this is actually the intent of the DHS as the press release indicates? Please note that this question is not about are the stockpiles unnecessary? Rather it is "Is the government building the stockpiles with the intent of limiting the availability of ammunition on the market?" For those saying that Inhofe is not accusing the administration of this here is a more direct accusation. 

1 pound requires 3500 calories of burn. So if you need to lose 10 pound smoking will take heavy smoking for 175 weeks. That is over 3 years. With the damage that it does to your body you are better off spending a half an hour a day doing a slow run(12 minute mile) and gaining benefits of that which include a greater calorie burn than best case smoking, than you are taking smoking back up. And the reasons given for smoking helping to lose weight: Smoking damages your body cause it to malfunction. source 

Source So the first time when it creates the oxide coating yes it ill consume oxygen to create the Chromium Oxide. After the initial coating the metal resists oxidation so it should consume little if any oxygen unless the oxide coating is removed. 

There are different styles of Learning. When you are taught using one that works well for you you learn well. When it is not unless you can adapt that to your style then you do not. However if you do not reach your potential then how can you measure your capacity. How can you tell if someone has reached their optimum potential. (For this the point where additional training and practice has negligible effect) It is claimed 10000 hours of practice is required to achieve expert level performance. Thought Experiment on how to do good evaluation as the question asks: So to create an experiment that could measure what you are asking for you would need to introduce controls. 

This is a tricky area. The US Constitution forbids the federal government (refered to as the state) from infringing on the rights of its citizens. The states then each have their own governing document, most of which incorporate the restrictions to include the state government. There is a point of controversy among some as to wether or not those restrictions are automatically conferred upon any governments underneath them. Here is a copy of the ordinance in question. (Thank you Oddthinking) Under the Arkanasas Constitution I would expect that the Article 1 Section 4 may provide some protection to the group: 

The reason these oils seem to penetrate more is due to the irritation caused by Capsaicin. Web MD Says: 

Source The "news" article is posted with out any credible sources. So my question is: Does Germany actually store ~50% of its physical gold reserves in the US Federal Reserve?Has Germany requested that the US Return the Gold it has entrusted the the US Federal Reserve? If so has the US refused to honor the request? Has Germany requested an audit of the actual gold in the reserves? Has the US refused the Audit Request? 

The closest thing the author of the site has to evidence is someone who said they were there years ago and heard it, or something like it said. Is there any evidence that Hubbard said this? 

From the cited passage of Deuteronomy If a man happens to meet a virgin who is not pledged to be married and rapes her and they are discovered, 29 he shall pay her father fifty shekels[c] of silver. He must marry the young woman, for he has violated her. He can never divorce her as long as he lives. 

However the UK Naval Mine Countermeasures site indicates that WWI Era Mines were more volatile. It also indicates that devices similar to the WWI designs have been used as recently as 1980 during the Iran-Iraq war, and that its forces are still called to deal with legacy WWI and WWII devices. So the devices being deployed today are designed not to detonate due to contact with sea life. Their are older devices still found (though rarely now) that are not discriminant. 

SOURCE Is there any evidence to support this claim? Was entering the 8 Zero's all that was required to launch World War III (Or at least a missle)? 

So while the oils feel like they are penetrating more I find no claims that it is actually absorbed by the skin at a greater rate. 

Article 12 (Starts page 40) deals with the powers of local governments and businesses incorporated in the state of Arkansas. Section 4: 

A family member posted a link to a blog about companies using slave labor. While the title is a bit misleading because it is not the companies themselves directly employing slave labor but rather their suppliers in foreign countries. Most of the claims boil down to sources using people under 18 working long hours for low pay rather than true slavery. However I did find one claim that I found very troubling: 

TL;DR; - Oxygen is consumed during the initial burn that creates the Oxide "Shell". Once the coating is there the chromium is protected from further oxidation so the answer becomes no. Though the amount of oxygen that it consumes will be negligible under normal circumstances. 

Natural gas burns at ~2770 C so if you are heating a skillet coated in teflon over a natural gas burner you have the potential to achieve spot temps over 260 C. So It would appear the the answer to your first question is yes 260C is achievable on a common household stove. Even DuPont the maker of teflon agrees that it is possible and should be avoided. There has been a link to reproductive problems with gases released by Teflon pans As for birds DuPont recognizes that the gases pose a danger to them. There are nonstick pans that are non-PTFE that would not have these problems. 

Technically yes. Though in the opposite of the way you are describing. The Hydrogen Fuel Cell harnesses waste energy from the chemical reaction between hydrogen and oxygen that produces water. 

This article basically says that you need to be careful when you quit smoking not to allow yourself to gain weight. However there is nothing that says that you can lose weight by smoking. In fact: 

In Vietnam it the rivers were mined to prevent the safe passage of forces opposed to Ho Chi Minh. There were forces with the primary duty to clear these mines. 

Because the rape would make the woman undesirable to other men as a wife, the fathers property would have been damaged. 

A legal advice site exists I do not see any statute that would prevent an attorney from exercising their free speech rights on a site like this. A quick Google search reveals literally hundreds of similar sites. The US Constitution states: 

I am a programmer and have been for over 20 years and I am starting to feel the effects of Carpal Tunnel Syndrome. I have always used the QWERTY style keyboard though I have often heard that the DVORAK style was better and more ergonomic. In doing research I found this site which claims: 

Short answer is NO corporations enjoy the same freedoms and rights as any natural person. The idea is called corporate personhood (Wikipedia has a great write up of this already) While this idea is unpopular it has been upheld several times and is considered the current law of the land. If a company is publicly traded then the SEC does have some requirements mostly that require accurate reporting but none that require the company actually attempt to make a profit. Most shareholders want a Return on Investment however you do not need to maximize profit to make a return on investment. A shareholder can vote to remove the board or any officers so generally they work to keep an acceptable ROI though stated goals. Though no law actually enforces that the company persue those goals nor does the law penalize those companies for not attempting to persue them so long as they do not attempt to represent that they are(commit fraud). A perfect example of this would be the American Red Cross it is a business lead by a CEO but operates as a non profit entity. While there are some specific things that the Red Cross has been chartered to do by law it operates independently and manages its finances as a business. 

But basically some cells can relocate. Almost all cancer types can spread. The biopsy is used because it is a way to extract the cells from the body to study them. There is not enough known about all cancers that research is needed. But the biopsy may cause cells to enter the bloodstream and allow them to form a Metastatic tumor elsewhere in the body. But sometimes the value of the biopsy results are worth the risk when it will provide a proper treatment program. I would also note that biopsy is just one of many diagnostic procedures that can be performed. 

(There is more to it on the site that does not seem relavent) However Arkansas does allow limited home rule which I would assume was used to enact this law. I would expect that the state constitution protections above would protect from this should it ever get to court. 

Detemine the best way to teach each of students. Force them to learn the same things in the way that teaches them the best. Carefully measure the results after certian numbers of hours and get a statisical sample. Then selectively inter breed them with each other. Gather data. Repeat the process. Probably repeat for several generations... Do we see the problems with this?` 

But I have never seen any actual proof of this and always assumed it was just one of those midwest folksy sayings. Is there any truth too it?

In addition the US used mines to prevent the VC from using the waterways. This site has a listing of different munitions and this PDF has better specs on weapons deployed in Iraq. A contact mine does not care what contacts it but generally requires the contact have enough force to prevent accidental detonation from wave action or debris. This US Navy Marine Mammal site claims: 

A claim was made today by an equipment manufacturing industry representative that in the last 10 years Non-Union labor had far out paced Union labor in productivity gains and that Non-Union Shops where now significantly more productive than Union Shops. Are there any statistics that can confirm or refute this? 

Source How stuff Works I heard this claim again today that the marijuana today is 10x more potent than it was in the 60's. The claim was from an unnamed law enforcement union official (presumably from California) about why marijuana should not be legalized. How stuff works came to the conclusion that it would be difficult to tell if it was more potent today. But with a claim of 10x that should be more refutable or verifiable. Is there any hard data anywhere to support or refute this or is this just a made up number? 

Water is a stable compound. So it is not going to split into its respective compound with out a catalyst. Because of this water will never act as the sole "Fuel." For Water Electrolysis to occur like you have suggested would also require an electrical input. This would more correctly be the termed the fuel that would run an Electrolysis Motor. There is currently no evidence of a motor that can do this more efficiently than a standard electric motor. 

So it would seem by this reading it would be more akin to today's statutory rape where the woman would not be able to consent though this would be less than involuntary. It should be noted that the passage requires the man to take his victim as his bride. There is nothing in the passage that requires the woman to accept the man as her husband. Another thing to consider is that the times were different. 

I have heard various versions of this meme and was tempted to quote it in a comment on another thread. This site appears to do a fairly decent job of investigating the claim but leaves the conclusion based at best on anecdotal evidence that is disputed. 

Drudge Report had a headline on 12-1-2013 that claimed that the PAL security protocol was illegally bypassed from 1962 through 1977 by setting the launch code to 00000000 on all minutemen missiles. 

Is there any evidence to back these claims up. When I search the internet I see several people who have decided through their anecdotal experience that they did not think so. Is there any actual evidence one way or the other?
