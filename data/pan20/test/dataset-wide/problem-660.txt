Start by ensuring your seat height and fore-aft position are correct. There are numerous resources available on the web for this. I personally find the Global Cycling Network's YouTube videos to be accessible and informative. Try this one for starters 

I don't think what what you are proposing to construct would not be anywhere near strong enough to function properly as a tire. Tires are not just molded rubber. They are contain a casing of continuous fibers that enables then to withstand inflation pressures and lateral forces caused by cornering. $URL$ By gluing parts of two tires together you would not have a continuous casing running through the tire. 

Look for cycling clubs and local bike shops (usually abbreviated to 'LBS' here) in your area. Many cycling clubs cater to casual riders and organize group rides that include casual groups. Many local bike shops also organize group rides that cater to casual riders. Riding with like-minded others so a great way to learn about cycling and find trails in your area suitable for the type of riding you want to do. 

I think road bikes are actually more durable than a lot of riders give them credit for. Unless you were seriously crashing into potholes there should not be any damage (although you may have picked up some paint dings from loose gravel surfaces). You can do a standard 'once-over', paying particular attention to the wheels: 

A good place to start is looking up the specifications of your current Suntour fork: $URL$ The important points are: 

Assuming you are talking about the original WD-40 product, no don't apply that to your frame. WD-40 is basically a light oil in a mineral solvent. The solvent carries the oil into tight spaces (such as a corroded thread fastener) via capillary action and this is what gives it its penetrating and loosening oil capability. The solvent then evaporates and leaves the oil behind. So, if you put WD-40 on your frame you are: 

As @ojs said length is measured steerer center to handlebar center, The other measurements to be aware of are the steerer diameter and handlebar diameter. On road bikes steerer tubes are usually 1 1/8 inch and handlebars 31.8mm. The numbers printed on the stem in the photo are max torque values for the steerer and bar clamp bolts. Note the units abbreviations of 'Nm' (Newton meters) and 'inlb' (inch pounds). 

Yes, this particular wheel rim size swap is possible with disc brake equipped bikes, if you have the tire clearance. 700c rims are 622mm in diameter. 650b rims are 584mm. The difference in radius - what has to be made up by a bigger tire - is 19mm. Assuming tire width is approximately tire height, going from a 28mm tire to a 42mm tire makes up most of that difference. 

There are various resources for determining tire width / rim inner width compatibility, including the chart on the Sheldon Brown page linked to in other answers here. Tire manufacturers should provide min and max rim widths for each tire model and size. Whether you can, or want to drop to a 2.1" from a 2.8" tire in terms of ride and handling depends on what type of bike you have and what riding you are doing. Presumably at 2.8" you have an MTB so you need to think about the potential for reduced bump absorption and traction with narrower tires. 

There is a confusing array of different types of bicycle available these days: road, mountain, hybrid, gravel, cyclocross, commuter - the list goes on. None of these types of bikes are 'better' than any other, each is just optimized for a particular type of riding. You will have to decide what kind of riding appeals to you the most. Also take into account what kind of roads and trails are accessible to you in your area. 

If you really need a freewheel on each side, that both drive the wheel forward, then you would need a custom built hub with a left hand freewheel thread on the left hand side, and you'd need to build a left hand freewheel too. If you just needed a freewheel on the right hand side, just use a single speed bike rear hub. You would of course need a custom fork for either as rear hubs are wider that front hubs. 

If there are several spokes showing this failure, it's not because of a single impact. I think it's safe to say that the rim was simply overloaded and has suffered metal fatigue from stress cycles imposed by the differing forces on the spoke as the wheel rotates. Can't say if the failure is because of overloading beyond what the wheel was designed for, or poor design or a manufacturing problem. 

Yes this is possible with a free-hub style hub, but you may run into some issues. You can use a sprocket from a 10 speed cassette, and replace the other sprockets with spacers. You can place the sprocket in the spacer stack to achieve good chain alignment. I don't know how Campagnalo cassettes are built but Shimano cassettes combine the largest sprockets onto a spider, so you would not be able to use those individually. Cassette sprockets are of course designed to enable the chain to come of them easily when shifting, so they are not as good as retaining the chain as a purpose made single-speed sprocket. For the same reason you may have an issue with the chain coming off the chainring without a front derailleur. This is why 1x systems use a 'double-wide' chainring for better chain retention. Sheldon Brown has a page that deals with single speeds: $URL$ find the section titled 'Cassette Hubs'. 

The specific points of damage I'd really be worried about are the hard edged dents near the junction with the bottom bracket shell lugs (red rectangle in pic below). I think there is a high probability that cracks will form from those points. 

Piecemeal upgrades on a low-middle level bikes is generally not worth it. Each individual upgrade does not buy you very much. The amount you will spend on enough upgrades to make a substantial difference will be more that the cost of a new better bike minus what you can get by selling the old bike on the used market. The possible exception for mid level bike that has a decent groupset is wheels. Wheel mass has a effect on acceleration than non-rotating parts. Other ways to spend your money: 

If you are coming back from a long layoff, I'd fix the Cannondale, then if you keep up riding in the future, spend some time considering if you want to upgrade and what to. It's never a good idea to be choosing a new bike under pressure to get riding. Make sure the things the repair shop wants to replace are really needed. Cables and housings - yes that's a good idea and relatively inexpensive, but you could do that yourself. Chain and cassette - make the shop prove they are worn out to the point of needing replacement. If not ride them until the do. Definitely get the shop to explain why exactly they want to replace the wheels, and what they want to replace them with. You might be able to get a better deal on the used market through Craigslist or Ebay. 

If you want to improve balance and control out of the saddle at any speed, even freewheeling, you just have to practice doing it. Note that balance while pedaling out of the saddle on a trainer vs. on the road will be very different as the bike is held firmly upright in the trainer With respect to power output: pedaling out of the saddle is usually done for a short burst of power against a high resistance with a low cadence - either up a short steep slope or accelerating in a too high gear. Pedaling at a sitting cadence while standing up will be quite inefficient. Basically, you have to get the gear ratio selection right to enable max power output. Lower for in the saddle, higher for out of the saddle. Edit: You might want to experiment with how forward or back over the bottom bracket you position yourself when out of the saddle. You may find you can find a more comfortable position that works better for you. 

I would say you either have an extremely worn out cassette and chain, or lack of tension in the rear derailleur. Possibly exacerbated by the gear indexing being out of adjustment. You can inspect the cassette sprockets for wear. Very worn teeth will be asymmetrical and look like a shark fin. A Google search will yield images of worn sprockets. Check the front chainrings at the same time. If the cassette, chain and chainrings are worn they simply have to be replaced. There are two tensioning springs in a rear derailleur known as the A and B springs. The A spring rotates the cage, the B spring tensions rotates the whole derailleur relative to the bike frame. Either could be broken. The B spring is adjusted by the 'B screw', this might be slackened off far too much. Change gears onto the smallest sprocket and chainring, then check to see if the derailleur and cage have any spring tension. You can Google for how to adjust the B screw. If either spring is broken you will probably need to replace the derailleur. 

Nope. For the cassette: the cassette mounts on the freehub body. The position of the freehub body on is fixed on the hub. Besides, there is no room for the cassette to move outwards as it's inside the frame. For the cranks: depending in what width bottom bracket shell you have, perhaps there might be a solution using a crank with a longer axle and a wider bottom bracket but you really don't want to do that because you'll end up with a very bad chain line alignment. I'm actually surprised you have not run into lack of tire space between the chainstays before hitting the chain. 

I can't see anything wrong at all. The any vibration you may feel when the rear wheels is spinning but the cranks and chain and cassette are not moving is due to the clicking of the pawls in the free-hub. I think if you hold a pedal and spin the cranks so the rear wheel turns you will not detect any vibration or 'shaking', as the free-hub will engage. I think if you ride the bike you will find it functions normally. 

I assume by 'hybrid tire' you mean a wide slick or semi-slick suitable for street use. You can fit any tire that is not too narrow for the rim, and not so large it interferes with the frame. The rims are 40mm so anything above 1.75" will work (although putting a narrow tire on this bike is not necessarily recommended). The stock tires are 3" but you would not want to go above that for street use. As the bike has disc brakes you can swap the wheels out for smaller diameter ones. Going to ISO 599 rims will drop the bike 12.5mm in addition to whatever effective wheel diameter reduction you get by fitting smaller width tires. I won't question why you want 26" wheels, but I will question why you'd buy a new bike then swap out a expensive major component ... err, well, I guess 26" wheel XC mountain bikes are not really available any more, but then have to consider if you'll have a hard time finding 26" disc brake MTB wheels (unless you wanna have a set built of course). 

These days there is a range of drop bar 'road' bikes with a spectrum of capabilities. Using some of Specialized's current range to illustrate: You can ride a 'race' bike such as the Tarmac with narrow, slick 23mm tires on a gravel or poorly paved surface, but it's not much fun, and you risk puncturing of damaging the wheels. The Diverge with it's 30mm tire does better, but don't expect to crash it over large potholes without consequence. The Sequoia with 27.5" wheels and 42mm tires is in mountain bike wheel territory and obviously deals with rough surfaces much better. Basically bigger tires means better rough surface capability, but at the expense of heavier, harder to accelerate wheels. For the C&O Canal towpath - a trail I'm very familiar with (fairly smooth crushed gravel, a few ruts and potholes) - a tire 28-35mm with some tread will probably work. 

The internet is replete with resources for bike assembly and maintenance. Google for instructions for fitting a quill stem. 

Depends on what derailleur and front rings you have. The current Deore XT M8000 GS (which we can probably assume you have) specs say: 

It's a bad idea to sand down or modify the carbon fiber of the seat tube. You don't know what you will do to its integrity or strength. I would do some research to find out if a replacement aluminum seat 'cap' that accommodates the clamp can be bought, and the proper technique and epoxy type for bonding it in. If you choose not to fix the frame, don't junk it. Stick it on Ebay with the appropriate disclaimer about the seat clamp. Maybe someone with the required know0how will but it up and fix it. 

Specific product recommendations are off topic here. However, we can point you in the right direction. At the time of writing SRAM makes 1x drivetrains for road, gravel or cyclocross bikes. Perhaps start with SRAM Apex-1 or Rival-1. 

I personally would not regard that site's seat height calculator as a good guide. It seems very simplistic, and there is no indication of what method it is based on. The best saddle height for any given rider really cannot be determined through a couple of measurements. Most methods involve the rider sitting on the bike, looking at how far the legs extend when pedaling, and making adjustments. Then making further adjustments based on how they feel while riding. One of my favorite guides to saddle height is this video from GCN. Googling can yield other guides and how-tos. Once you are sure your saddle height is good you can address hand pain. You may be in a too aggressive position (body leaning more forward) that is putting more weight on your hands than you want. The body's core strength serves to take weigh off of the hands, so you may find you get used to the new position and the problem goes away. If not consider raising and moving back your handlebars to achieve a slightly more upright riding position. 

This article talks about total derailleur capacity and gives a triple chainring example $URL$ As far as I know, there is nothing intrinsic about a triple that prevents fitting a larger sprocket cassette. If the derailleur has the required capacity (and accommodates the largest sprocket in the cassette), then it will work. 

Terminal velocity is reached when the force on the rider due to gravitation acceleration equals the force from aerodynamic drag on the rider and bicycle plus rolling resistance of the bicycle. In the calculation below I will assume rolling resistance of the bicycle is much less than the air drag and will omit it. I may update this later. I will use typical values for gravity, air density etc at sea level on Planet Earth. Gravitational force on the rider and bike F = m × g × sin(ϕ) 

Highly unlikely that tire installation was just clumsy enough to cause a slow puncture that appeared a couple of days later. Pinching the tube with a tire lever would cause a relatively large hole or rip. I think you would have a hard time convincing your repair shop they caused the problem in any case. Patch the leak and move on. 

Park tool has a guide to figuring out what type of free hub/freewheel you have, and what tool you need to get it off. $URL$ With that knowledge you should be able to to figure out what type of replacement freewheel/spocket you need (or two, as you have a flip-flop hub). Update: Also see the Sheldon Brown page on Freewheels. Depending on what the freewheel thread turns out to be, you should be able to get a replacement freewheel that has a more standard lockring. You might consider creating a 'bodged' tool to get the current freewheel off. You might be able to 'drift' the lockring loose by tapping the ring around with an old screwdriver and hammer. 

In reality it's not quite as complicated because a crankset intended for a particular style of bike will have the appropriate combination of BCD, choice of bottom bracket types and chainline. Older bikes used a threaded bottom bracket shell with either a loose or cassette type bearing and spindle. There are a couple of different types of interfaces between the spindle and crank arms. The bottom bracket bearings on an older bike may be worn out so replacing the bearings should be considered - this also gives you some more crank choices as the there are a few types that work with threaded shells. If you add photos of the existing crank and bottom bracket from both sides we can give you more specific guidance.
