I think that a mathematician/scientist is nothing different from an explorator, I mean a person who is physically exploring a place. Why the explorator is exploring? The taste for exploration is actually a basic instinct of any animal, it is good, from an evolutionary point of view, to have this kind of taste because it results in collecting potentially useful information, useful for survival and reproduction. This is true for the dog exploring his neighbourhood but also for a man building a science. The taste for exploration is mixed and reinforced by different incentives, one is beauty as you mentioned, another is challange (this is probably mostly human): feeling challanged by a difficult task (reaching some high peak) and then having the reward of looking everything with your new superior point of view. To answer your question I would say that the driving force of a mathematician is not "directly" the quest for knowledge, altought it is the result. Knowledge in itself wouldn't be pursued if one wouldn't have the taste for exploration or the urge to solve some kind of real problem. On the other hand if a community of mathematicians/scientists would be required to express what is the valuable thing they are working on they wouldn't say that "the community" is working to create beauty and achieving specific results as a challange to themself. 

Thanks again to everyone who has contributed to the answers. I thought I would take what I have read and learned from various sources to date and attempt to answer my own question. Not intended to be formal, necessarily free from contradiction or redundancy, or complete but here is an answer currently swimming around in my head.(Note: I tend to use the terms property, characteristic, and quality interchangeably throughout the answer).. Any and all things, physical and non-physical can be characterized with the same general label. Humans commonly use the term "object" as a label that can be used to reference any and all things. Humans can identify a particular object by scoping (or at least attempting to scope) the nature of the parts or boundaries for any aspect of an observation (physical or non-physical). All objects have some qualities or characteristics that are tied to the object (even a primitive term can be viewed as an object that has a characteristic of having no intrinsic relationships with other objects), so humans are often able to identify a previously observed object based on qualities or characteristics of a current observation. 

In welfare economics, there is a a similar position (without the naturalist presumption) about the good as opposed to the ought called the preference satisfaction view, the view that if someone chooses A over B, then he is better off with A than with B. As John Broome remarks, "... the preference-satisfaction theory is obviously false, and no one really believes it." (Broome 1999, p. 4) Perhaps something similar could be said about the above passage? Related to that, the view that preferences are revealed by choices is called revealed preferences theory in welfare economics and has also been challenged from various perspectives - e.g. based on a prior rejection of the preference satisfaction view, based on empirical phenomena (e.g. akrasia, Kahneman&Tversky's work, examples of intransitive preferences), or based on foundational value incomensurability and pluralism. Turning to values in the narrow sense, in the analytic literature on values I know of (von Wright, Hansson, Chang, Gert, Rabinowicz, ...) , values are either tied to the ought by definition according to the fitting attitude analysis of values, hence cannot be naturalized anyway, or they are characterized by their logical structure. In the latter case, there is much agreement with your points, because in order to make sense of the "producing a good feeling" analysis, more has to be said - comparative values have to be explained. And once you lay out how comparative values work in naturalistic terms, you might end up with the preference models of this tradition, thus implicitly defining values. However, at the same time it must be pointed out that the logic of "ought to" and related notions (must, permitted to, may) is not exactly the same and not directly derivable from the logic of values (i.e. essentially peference logic), or at least I'm not aware of such work. For example Hansson (2001) lays out values based on preference logic in the first part of his book and norms based on deontic logic in the second part of the book. (And deontic logics have much more problems than the modelling of preferences and values, which is fairly well-understood.) The bottomline is that there are many reasons why you are right and you can find a lot of literature on this topic within economics and philosophy, but of course at least for analytic philosophers the devil is always in the detail... 

Although the identification of Abstract objects may not require the process of abstraction, it seems plausible that the reason the word "Abstract" came in to use with the word "object" was because so many objects with the above qualities have/can been identified via some form of an abstraction process. 

Mathematics is the collection of patterns associated with abstract objects whereby the abstract objects appear to posses at least the following quality: 

So, then we have mathematicians. Mathematicians identify and analyze mathematics. In pursuit of their studies, mathematicians generate a "collection" of accepted methods, tools, techniques, standards, and best practices that are useful in advancing the body of knowledge associated with mathematics. Both the "collection" and the body of knowledge are shared and modified as the field matures as a set of highly connected mathematical realizations. 

Your question is connected to several other linked philosophicsl problems. I'll mention two of them: 1) The teleporter paradox: suppose you have a technology like this which can teleport things by destroying their physical bodies and recostructing them in a distant place. If you teleport yourself will you still exist when the process ends? 2) The hardware-software dualism and the location of the self: if you have a perfect copy of one's brain and body there is no way to decide who is the original person and who is the copy, so you might be lead to think that the self is connected to the concrete matter of the brain (and not to the information): if you replace matter, you replace the self. But the brain has a lot of matter which is not strictly necessary in order to make things work, and there is a lot of substitution naturally going on in any brain (cells which born/dies in adult brains) and apparently you cannot identify a "core" where the self could be. If these issues fascinate you maybe you will enjoy the famous book "The mind's I" by D. Hoftstadter. 

Taking this nice manuscript by Kevin Klement as a basis, let us check whether (1) ☐∃x∃y(Wx & Iyx) follows from the axioms of counterpart theory. Using the translation procedure from first-order modal logic to FOL with counterpart axioms, I obtain: (2) ∀w'[Ww' → ∃x∃y(Ixw' & Iyw' & Wx & Iyx)] If I'm not mistaken, (2) does not follow from the axioms of CT and is not valid in FOL+CT. In fact, the counterpart theory axioms only assert that there is something actual. Interestingly, there is also no axiom stating that every world inhabits itself. Since I'm not a Lewis expert, I welcome others to check this answer and perhaps improve it. (It's always better to check for yourself instead of relying on others in such matters, right?) 

And so how do humans recognize mathematical objects? Well, it occurs when one is able to identify objects that contain the qualities listed above for mathematical objects, usually done while studying mathematics or pondering interesting questions that contain mathematical elements. This will likely be done in the context of the human version of the "collection" and existing body of knowledge. By doing so, human mathematicians are able to leverage widely accepted approaches and conclusions against the mathematical object being observed. 

Many objects that have proven to be useful to human beings can be identified by the process of abstraction, whereby common characteristics observed from a collection of objects are labeled as an object in and of itself. Some of the objects that can be identified from the abstraction process have a a pattern of qualities that are consistent with what is known as Abstract objects. Abstract objects have a pattern of demonstrating at least the following qualities: 

I think there are wrong assumptions in your question. Actually there is no need (on a purely physical ground) for the thoughts to correspond in any way to a reality "outside" of the mind/brain. Thoughts are just linked to electric activity inside your brain, this is the only direct physical link between them and a physical reality. The reason why the thoughts often actually do correspond to real things outside is evolution and natural selection. And it happens that having also the ability to depart a little bit your thoughts from this correspondence is an evolutive advantage (you can build complex models, imagine scenarios before you meet them and be driven by fear or desire for those uncertain furure scenarios increasing your probability to survive, as explained by Rex here). 

No, a preorder relation - aka weak preference relation - or, equivalently, a strict ordering plus an equivalence relation suffice to talk about "more" or "less". Not all such relations can be represented by a "value function" and even if they can the value function is only ordinal and such a representation is still considered qualitative even though it involves real numbers. (The term "value function" comes from normative economics, where also sometimes "utility" is used, though the later is often reserved for values undr risk; I don't know how mathematicians would call it. It 's just a function v: D→ℝ from some domain of objects D to the reals such that v(a)≥v(b) ⇔ a≽b) For quantitative method, you likely want to measure intensities of "more" and "less" directly and compare distances such measures, which under normal circumstances would correspond to a cardinal utility function. That's all a bit vague and fuzzy; a fellow mathematician who knows some measure theory could give you more details and representation theorems. Or did I misunderstand your question?
