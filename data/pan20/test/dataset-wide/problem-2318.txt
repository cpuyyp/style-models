That is more clearly showing exposed beetle tunnels in what looks to be somewhat rotten wood. Here you can see the pattern is more random, with no consistent clawing or chewing in any directions. There are whole flat areas that are missing that don't look like linear features. The sides of the tunnels are also almost vertical in places. In short, this picture clearly shows insect damage. It would have avoided much confusion if you had shown this originally. A entomologist or maybe a forester familiar with your area can probably tell you what insect did this. The tunnels made by various insects have species-distinctive characteristics, like the general pattern, size, depth, crossectional shape, shape of entrance holes, etc. 

This happens to be from the Tonto National Forest in AZ. It's about as typical a trail sign as there is in the US. 

Most hummingbirds are attracted to red flowers in the wild. Therefore, a hummingbird feeder should mimic red flowers for best results. The color of the "nectar" itself doesn't matter. After all, hummingbirds don't see the nectar in flowers. They see the petals, which guide them to where the nectar is. However, some hummingbird feeders rely on the color of the nectar to provide the color queues to the bird, unlike real flowers. In those cases, you need red liquid. Sometimes you will see hummingbirds hover around the nectar reservoir instead of the opening in such feeders, although they usually figure it out and find how to sip the nectar. It should be no surprise the mimicking nature as best as possible yields the best results. This means having the right parts of the feeder look like a flower, with the nectar sippable thru the center of the flower. The picture of the hummingbird hovering by the trumpet-shaped flower on the picture of the right bottle in your question is a good example. The bird sees and homes in on the petals, and can't see the nectar at all. Flowers that have co-evolved with hummingbirds as pollinators tend to be trumpet-shaped, red, and just deep enough so that the hummingbird can reach the nectar in the bottom with its long and thin beak. This "locks out" some of the other nectar-seekers that don't have the right shape to get pollen stuck on them and then deliver it to the next flower of the same species. Therefore, make your hummingbird feeder with red trumpet-shaped flowers. The nectar then doesn't need to be a particular color since it shouldn't be visible directly anyway. As a interesting aside, some insects have evolved to work like hummingbirds and be able to sip nectar from deep trumpet-shaped flowers too, and pollinate the flowers in return like hummingbirds do. Some good examples are found in the sphinx moths, sometimes even called "hummingbird moths". I'm at the wrong computer right now, but maybe later I'll remember to upload a picture of a white lined sphinx moth sipping from a scarlet gillia flower. Both hummingbirds and these sphinx moths feed from and pollinate these flowers. I've even seen hummingbirds chasing away sphinx moths in the same patch of scarlet gillia. After being subjected to the same evolutionary pressure as the hummingbirds, the sphinx moth actually resembles a hummingbird in shape and behavior. It's really cool how nature works sometimes! Added Here is a picture of a white lined sphinx moth (Hyles lineata) sipping nectar from a scarlet gillia flower. 

The rod is 14 inches long, the fiberglass part is 6.5 mm in diameter, and the outer diameter of the aluminum piece is 9.5 mm. The fiberglass is cracked near the aluminum sleave, and it is rough with fibers sticking out at the right end where it fits into the aluminum sleave of the next piece. The problem is, the company that made this tent seems to have vanished and I don't know how to get replacement rods. I'd like to get a complete set of rods, since if this one went the others are probably not far behind. There seem to be aluminum rods available with bungy cord in the middle, but finding a set that is exactly the length this tent requires seems to be impossible. Anyone know how to get parts for this old tent, or have any other ideas? Added: Yes, it's easy to find generic replacement tent poles, but the ones I have seen are all quite different from what my tent uses. This is a particularly small tent and the radius of curvature is significantly smaller than other tents. This means the thicker poles that are easy to find would be stressed much more. Mine are only 6.5 mm diameter, probably for a good reason. The replacement poles are also much longer than mine. I suppose the long poles could be cut down, but cutting fiberglass is tricky and can easily damage the material if the right tools aren't used, which I probably don't have since I don't know exactly what the right tool would be. I am imagining just cutting with a saw would fray the fibers, which is basically cracking the fiberglass, which can't be a good thing. Another issue is that the pole ends need to fit into the grommets on my tent. I rather doubt there is such a thing as a standard grommet diameter. This is not as easy as just Googling for "tent pole replacement". Surely someone here has been thru this process before and has some words of wisdom? Added 2: This is in response to a comment asking for more details of the rods. The grommets that the end of the tent poles fit into are just circular metal disks with holes in them. I don't have the tent here, but the inner diameter of these holes is a little larger than the diameter of the tent poles, which is 6.5 mm. The picture shows a middle piece, but the end pieces have black plastic end caps, with the tips of those being about the same diameter as the fiberglass rod (6.5 mm). The fiberglass rods are solid, so have no inner diameter. 

No, there is nothing on the AT that justifies carrying a firearm. The extra weight and space is much more of a detriment than the extremely unlikely and frankly inconceivable case where a firearm would be a help. Since the AT crosses many jurisdictions, there may also be legal issues that could vary every few miles. The whole concept just doesn't make sense. A spare water bottle consuming the same space and weight would be far more useful. 

Here are some points of interest you should definitely include, based on your rough proposed area: Arches National Monument. It's at least worth a day trip thru there. There are some natural arches in other places in the general region, but there is nothing like Arches. Bryce Canyon. The highest concentration of the best hoodoos anywhere. It's also a nice and comfortable place to stay, being about 7000 feet up. Grand Canyon, of course. Grand Staircase - Escalante. There are slot canyons all over the region you intend to explore, but this place has some great ones, and they are accessible. It's also still fairly wild. I'd stay off the beaten track in the adjacent National Forest. The campground in Capitol Reef is overrun with tourists, screaming kids, and drunken yahoos being rowdy until 2:00 in the morning. Bisti De Na Zin Wilderness. This is a amazing but little-known place (Shh, don't tell anyone). It's about 35 miles south of Farmington NM in the Four Corners area, a little east of the north-south road. It's very primitive. There is just a parking area and a fence to keep cattle out. You walk in and at first it looks like nothing special. Poke around in the side canyons to the right (south), and you'll see a whole bunch of other-worldly rock formations. If NASA ever needs to fake a landing on a different planet, this is where they'll go. 

This one is on the top of Mt Lafayette in the White Mountain National Forest of NH. Again, it's basically the same design. The sign at top was recently replaced, and I'm not sure if it is more yellow due to being newer and not weathered yet (this location is above treeline open to the sky all year), or whether it's the new "composite" material that is plastic and wood. Presumably the Forest Service has looked into this and converged on something that works and has low lifetime cost. If it's good enough for the US Forest Service, it's good enough for me. However, we have had several people pushing us to use newer plastic material that is claimed to last longer than wood, although its also much more expensive. The main body of the plastic is white, but the front has a layer of dark green on it. Routing lines into it cuts thru the front layer to expose the back, so you get white letters on dark green. I've seen these signs and they are quite readable. The question is, do you know of any experience with different materials for trail signs? Are most wood because that's all that's been available until now? Are there organizations that are using newer materials where they would have used wood signs in the past? If so, is there any longevity data, lifetime cost data, etc? Also, any opinions on the esthetics? If you were hiking the back woods of a small town in New England and came accross non-traditional trail signs, would you think Yuk, this high-tech stuff doesn't belong in the woods, or Cool, these guys are keeping up with the times, or something else? Added about plastic signs I didn't have a picture of the type of plastic sign I described, so I took one yesterday afternoon: 

Here you can walk around all you want. In fact you have to because there aren't any trails. But as you can see, it's easy to walk where you're not causing any lasting harm. You may leave a few footprints, but after the next rain or after enough wind they will be gone with basically no evidence you were ever there. This happens to be in the Eagle Tail Wilderness in southwest AZ. So few people go there that it's OK. If 100s showed up daily, then different rules would need to be made. 

A bunch of years ago I got a good enough look at a Canada Goose on Plum Island in Massachusetts to read the tag number. Unfortunately I don't remember exactly where I eventually found to report it, but it was a central clearinghouse for such things, in Washington DC if I remember right. They even sent me a postcard later telling me that this particular bird was banded near where I saw it two years earlier. If I found another bird tag today, I'd probably start by reporting it to the state Fish and Wildlife office. They may not be the right ones to eventually get the information, but I'm sure they would either take the information directly or tell me where the right place to report it is. Another possibility is to contact someone at a local Audubon Society office. Again, they may not be who ultimately needs to know, but they really should be able to refer you to the right place. 

That tree got bent over but not snapped when it was just tall enough so that its tip was where the end of the bend is now. One of the small branches near that tip happened to point upwards after the bending. That branch basically became the new trunk. The existing bent wood stayed where it was, with layers added each year enlarging its diameter. Now 25 year later you come along and see it. The tree survived its early trauma, but if it weren't growing at the side of a field that is actively maintained, it probably would not have gotten enough light to compete. Note that some of its branches are already dead. 

35° is 35°, whether in your car, in your pack, or in your refrigerator back home. However, handling raw meat otherwise is very different outdoors than at home. Personally, I think bringing raw meat into the wilderness is a bad idea. There are plenty of other foods that give you the same or better nutrition, don't require as careful handling, weigh less, and aren't as much of a predator-magnet. For example, if you really want to bring meat, try jerky. It preserves much better, can be chewed as-is without needing cooking, weighs a lot less, and takes up less space for the same amount of protein. If you are going into bear country, then raw meat is a particularly bad idea. Bears have such sensitive noses that a couple layers of plastic bags won't help much. I'm not sure there is such a thing as a "odor proof" bag to the point a bear can't smell meat inside. One advantage of being human is being able so survive on a very wide spectrum of foods. If you're going into the wilderness for a few days, leave the raw meat at home. Have a steak dinner when you get back. 

There is no such place. 40-60°F is a very narrow range. 20°F can be just from day and night variation, which leaves basically nothing for seasonal variation. Even if you meant daytime highs, I still don't think there is any place on earth that fits this description, let alone anywhere in the US. Let's flip this around and think of what would make a place have very low temperature variation. Seasonal variations get larger towards the poles, so starting in the tropics is probably a good idea. 60°F is very low for the tropics, so that means moving up in altitude. Even ignoring the rain criterion, this still sounds like a impossible goal. Imagine looking for this place by trying different elevations in the Andes near the equator. By the time you get to 60°F highs, you will be well below freezing at other times. Obviously anyplace with snow on the ground, ever, doesn't fit your criteria. Again, there is no such place here on earth in the open. What you ask does exist in caves.
