First of all this is behavior you should stop doing. You might be ashamed of your grades, but worst case is they turn you down. By not replying you are forcing them to turn you down. Stop caring about their decision, just send the grades when they ask. You have already explained why you grades are not as good as they might have been, and that explanation seems to have been acknowledged. Second to answer your question, I don't think you can gain anything from offering an explanation. Simply reply with: "My grades are attached, sorry for the delay." If you start saying that you are ashamed and that is why you didn't respond timely, they will think this is behavior that will be reflected in the job. I.e. that you will stick you head in the ground when faced with situations that you are not proud of (and there will probably be several of those), instead of handling the situation to the best of your abilities. This is not a good trait. 

Formal: Dates of employment and your responsibilities. Professional: How is your personal approach to the tasks/challenges you were presented during your employment. How do you usually contribute to team effort, and how can your next employer best utilise your skills. Etc. Personal: A bit about your personal relation with your previous boss. How did you contribute to the atmosphere at the workplace, what is your general mood, etc. In DK it is common to have a friendship-like relationship with your boss, you are pretty much seen as equal but with different responsibilities. Your boss decides what you do, and you do what your boss decides (unless you have a better idea), but that does not mean you are not (almost) equals. Contact information, such that the next employer can call and validate the information and get more details. 

But that is only 7 hours of sleep a night. I know it is common in this modern cooperate world to only sleep 7 or 6 hours a night, but most people need around 8. I myself am around 8.5. And as others have stated, exercise, it really improves the quality of your sleep. 

For diversity, let me provide an answer that is not US centric, but Denmark centric (and possibly also applies to much of the EU.) It is customary, when you quit your job, to ask for a written recommendation from your nearest boss. And unless you were fired for not doing your job, your boss will most probably provide one. It is normally a single full page with: 

Tell the interviewer about your career objective that can fit into their industry. Explain your real need of job and it's importance for mutual benefits of you and company. Sociology has many things to do with all companies, resources often don't perform well or don't work because of their personal issues and not because of technically sound. You can become a counselor and be like a freelancer where companies can get appointments from you to have discussions with you for a particular employee to share their issues to find a way to fix it. 

If they target and question your age. Then you can convince the interviewer easily with the same factor a plus point by saying to them, "Since I aged I got experience in my life which could save people falling into a pit, if I counsel them..." where you can say it as added advantage of hiring you. 

Be focused on work, The reason of those juniors not addressing you with a respect should not affect the work. Since people work as programmer and the job they are in; makes them to think the company is adapting US culture of addressing co-workers or senior programmers with their first name. Which is being un-pleasant for some people. Get them to a table or just express strongly at once while they call you with your name or anything which makes you offend, that you don't like the way that they use to address you and ask them to address you in way that you would like to be called. Don't get disturbed with their addressing method to you and spoil your productivity. your ultimate goal is to work, perform, grow and get paid. If they still don't listen to you and keep addressing you in way that you don't like. Then obviously you should take this to your decision making authority in your office to warn them severely. Make sure their friendship with you is not getting spoiled at the same time. If there is no effect after all this... Just stop talking to them unless it's official. 

This is a very common issue in India. Since Indians fall in between multiactive and reactive culture line. The seniors would expect respect. This is no one's fault. The tradition is as such made everyone in this country to behave with respect. Even though I can't able to see any questions from you, I can suggest you something as below, 

Let the recruiter know you received a competing higher offer but you are still very interested in their company. Ask if they might have any flexibility to compete with the other offer. Tell them that given the long-term financial impact, you need a day or two to think about it. 

I have been in this situation before and when I discussed my concerns with ownership, I was shocked that they took the side of the people who were hurting productivity and morale. I've since moved on to greener pastures, but in today's economy I know sometimes staying put and putting up with the nonsense makes the most sense. What I've found is that if ownership does not care, you cannot make them care. You can try, but generally that works out badly for you. Unless the ownership has enough respect for you that you can chirp in their ear without hurting your career, I think your choices are to accept things as they are or look elsewhere and move along where your motivation and "higher standards" will be an asset and not a detriment. 

Depending on the position, a lot of companies won't consider non-local candidates at all. On the other hand, if you have advanced / renowned / specialized skills they may be happy to fly you in and put you up in a nice hotel just for the interview. You could look for job offerings that specifically mention a willingness to relocate candidates. Go on-site at least once before accepting any offers. There are some things you just can't tell from skype. Or if you're sure you know where you want to be, if at all possible, I would move first and look in person. If you can't afford to do that, try to schedule more than one on-site interview in the same city during the same week so you can check out multiple opportunities on a single trip. 

You wrote "Since our corporate credit cards had expired the week before, they told me to use my own credit card. They also said to decline the rental car insurance as it was covered under their corporate agreement." How did they tell you this, do you have it in writing? If so, I imagine you have a very good leg to stand on, that you just followed orders and therefore the company is liable. Even if not, you still have a good argument, especially if the person who instructed you is willing to admit it / unable to refute it. I suggest communicating with your insurance company about the situation - speak in hyptotheticals until you're ready to file a claim. Since chances are they would rather not pay and raise your premiums, they may go to bat for you against your employer regarding liability, and they likely have the lawyer resources to get it resolved quickly in your favor. Ultimately this battle is between your insurer and your employer (your premiums increasing is just collateral damage), and if your insurer turns out to be strong and gets your employer to admit liability after gathering the facts, your employer shouldn't hold that against you. 

maybe based on expectations about their future performance and contribution to the company...? Yes, there is no doubt it's a bias. Unanimously, to get into an university like Harvard/Princeton/etc isn't that simple. A candidate has to cross all the hurdles, which includes their entire academic history into a rigorous test to keep up their good performance until they pass out the university with a graduation. So the corporate world respect them regardless of whether they have a practical real world experience, knowledge and wisdom. what I can do to stand out among all these Ivy Leaguers. What do they have that I do not have (apart from the degree), and how can I get that or learn that? The best way is being an asset, to become irreplaceable, a game changer and a person with values. Even if you learn or get a thing which is a difference between you and Ivy leaguers, it doesn't going to get you awards, appraisals, salary hike, etc., unless you apply it in a correct situation to make the company benefited. The gap between you and ivy leaguers have..and if you fill it, will that help you to win the race? So instead of worrying about the gap, concentrate on your way to win. The way your employer sees you and him doesn't gonna change until you make changes in your company with your efforts. Stick yourself to the goal of company. Check whether your personal goals that are being mutual with your company's goals and values. Work on it. For example: if you are a product developer, invent something which has been never done in an industry, go out and attend competitions to get your work on journals, be a team player at the first place which is primary responsibility. Improve the team's profit as much as you can which should top the list. If you are a business development executive, get a deal for the company which can increase the job opportunities and company's gross turn over. If my high performance today is not enough, then what do I need to signal to my employers so I also am seen as an equal? As I said before in the instance of product developer, create a valuable asset to the company. If your performance is not felt enough by the upper level management then it's a negative hit however, you can signal your employer by contributing your skills and efforts on something else like managing a team and helping your co workers to achieve the overall performance of your team etc.
