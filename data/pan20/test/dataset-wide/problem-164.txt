extensive education will be the key to success. 500 years ago, most people didn't think they were smart enough to learn how to read. today, basic literacy is nearly universal. even entry level jobs like ticket taker or cashier require some literacy. in the post-automation world, learning to identify and solve problems robots can't will be a basic skill that everyone learns. today most first world children receive between 12 and 23 years of education. in the post-automation world, people may receive at 20-30 years of education before they are considered "qualified" for a skilled career. in addition to subsidizing education, the government will probably implement a universal basic income. this would allow everyone to buy minimal food, clothing and shelter. in fact, a similar scheme was proposed in the united states in 1969 (killed in the senate) and recently voted on in switzerland (only 23% in favor). income disparity will increase exponentially. ever since the invention of the plow, income disparity has been getting exponentially larger because technology has allowed some people to become more productive than other people. while no one is likely to starve to death in the post-automation world, there will be people who only have the basics. in contrast, the super-rich are likely to have their own private floating island. on the plus side, those same super-rich will probably spend a lot of time making life better for the desperately poor (e.g. by eradicating malaria). or maybe it would be a utopia. if all manual labor is really done by robots, then in theory that includes building robots. in which case robots would be virtually free so surely some rich person will give one to everyone on the planet. life would be pretty easy if everyone had their own personal robot slave. with the cost of manual labor dirt cheap, anyone could grow all their own food, and build their own floating island. the only scarce resources would be raw materials and energy. and considering the abundant aluminum silicates in the earth's crust are easily made into aluminum and glass given enough energy, really only energy would be scarce. 

Upper Limit on the size of the head Technically humans have two brains: One in the head, another(smaller, much less powerful) in the stomach. The second brain basically regulates function of the digestive organs, or something. Maybe it can be thought of as an outpost of the first brain, a small outcropping of nerves that need to be "where the action is," i.e. a field operation. Now imagine that evolution decides humans need to get smarter, but the head is already big enough to cause childbirth difficulties(this is the case). The solution is that the second brain gets bigger, and is used for "multi-threaded computation." Here would be an example of Multi-threaded computation: Such tasks would comprise situations when the primary brain can give the secondary brain a simple problem and a time allotment, and the secondary brain can solve it all on its own, without using the incredible faculties of the primary brain. An example is counting, or arithmetic: It's very simple to do(theoretically at least), and it does not require very much real-time data transfer between the primary and secondary brains. Basically, the primary brain sends some simple information(what's the prime factorization of 23856293698273325739248573029876129384762983462138741241234612394872649876219834?), where the number of nerve impulses needed to send the problem is relatively small compared to the complexity of solving the problem, and then the secondary brain works on it, and works on it, and works on it, and then sends back: The answer is 2*3*5*7*11 etc. etc., which is also a relatively small number of nerve pulses relative to the complexity of the problem. Now, imagine that the secondary brain gets bigger and more powerful as the need arises until it's fair to call it an actual brain as opposed to just a nerve cluster in the stomach. Disclaimer -- When you assume human brains are basically just squishy computers, it will be much easier to think about them, and also a whole lot more incorrect. 

if you just want a semantic solution, you could have a big lake draining into a small lake, which later drains into the ocean. the locals might call the big lake a "sea" and the small lake a "lake", but a "sea" is by definition salty, which means the lake would be salty too. the connection between two would be a salty river. salty rivers on earth tend to be extremely rare, short and short lived (in geological time). but hey, they happen. 

on the plus side: almost everything that uses timezones would be simpler. specifically, when traveling or communicating across timezones. this includes reading things written in another timezone. notable examples include: 

pixelation basically, any simulation has a max resolution. at some point, you stop drawing discrete pixels, and just calculate the average effect of everything below that resolution as a continuous field of forces and probabilities. for example, if you wanted to simulate the solar system without calculating the position and velocity of every electron, then you would simply use an equation to compute the average position and velocity the planets and other large bodies. the pixelation limit of that simulation would be at the planet level and you couldn't break apart a planet to look at how it's internal components interact. if you want to "zoom in" on part of the earth and see animals running around, you need to increase your computing power substantially. the pixel limit of our universe appears to be sub-atomic particles (e.g. electrons), indicating that we live in a simulation that pixelates at around the size of an electron. you simply can not assign a location and velocity to an electron in any meaningful way because it is smaller than a "pixel" in the simulator that runs our universe. 

It's not that you need more coal. Hundreds of years after the start of the industrial revolution, and the world still isn't particularly close to running out of coal, even after long term increases in consumption. What you need instead is a lack of availability of other fuels-- no oil, no gas, no hydro, solar, etc as realistic options. Because oil and gas are produced mostly in the oceans, you could have a world with minimal tectonic plate action to move land to where the oceans used to be. Hydro power and wind will be developed as soon as the coal-fired generator/electricity itself, but these technologies, as in our world, could easily be too rare/expensive to develop on a large scale. Nuclear power of course can only be developed once atomic physics is well understood. All of this leaving a world dominated by coal. There's only one problem. China and India are huge coal users in our world, but they don't have steam powered trains. They use coal for electricity generation. How are you going to prevent this from happening? Perhaps the coal in your world is very clean-burning, so there is no incentive to switch to electricity from the steam- powered model. 

Assuming they don't land on the polar ice caps, in the middle of a desert, or during winter and an ice age, they can survive up to 430 million years ago, the approximate time period of the evolution of woody trees. So long as humans have wood to make spears, they can out-hunt any other predator in existence. Of course, I wouldn't say their survival is assured, but it seems likely. There are always animals to hunt, and there will be many, many more in a pre-human world. 

private property is generally simple. all people recognize the value of "i won't steal your stuff if you don't steal mine". conflict arises over shared resources (e.g. the air, the water, etc.). so, maybe the elves don't like the dragons flying over (and pooping on) their fields. maybe the dragons don't like the elves draining the rivers for irrigation. other resources can be seen as "shared". perhaps the elves view the forest as a "shared" resource they occasionally visit, but the dragons think they own the whole place. if either race could consistently control the land, then the dispute would end. but if the elves and dragons both regularly use the land with impunity, then it is de facto shared and conflict will continue. shared resource are particularly problematic when the two races use them in mutually exclusive ways. e.g. the elves want to clear land of trees to plant the crops they need, but the dragons want to grow trees which they need to build their nests. since both races view the land as a shared resource, and both races think they know the "right" way to use the land, conflict is likely to become intense. 

i don't think it would make any difference at all. a 30-40% strength advantage is absolutely devastating in 1-on-1 combat. 100-300% is simply overkill. women had very little political power until the "rule of law" took hold. after which, their relative physical strength was virtually irrelevant. 

That's an interesting question, since we have absolutely no idea what conditions are ideal for developing even carbon-based life. For instance, for carbon-based life, we would expect something like an atmosphere high in ammonia or other simple nitrogenous compounds(you need some 20-30 distinct proteins for DNA replication) to even have a shot in hell at producing life, yet there is no evidence for this kind of atmosphere existing on earth; based on our current knowledge, it is exceedingly improbable that on an earth-like planet(or any planet really), carbon-based life would arise by chance. Yet, it did. The bottom line is that nobody has any idea what chemistry is likely to produce life. But why try to use science to answer a question that it cannot answer? The origin of life in your universe could be a mystery in yours as much as it is in ours. Perhaps in your universe, the panspermia theory is correct, and life arose only once, somewhere incredibly far away. Perhaps your silicon-based life was created by carbon-based scientists, whose civilization was eventually destroyed without a trace. Perhaps your universe is a simulation in the mind of a deity. There are so many ways you can go with this. 

The planet could be a giant prairie. Grass can grow, but not much else. Hence why humans have to eat grazing animals, instead of plants directly. Similarly, if humans rip up the prairie and plant crops, you get a dustbowl that grows out of proportion and destroys a everything. Or, whenever humans settle down in one place, endemic disease eventually destroys the population and forces a return to hunter-gathering. Edit: If you downvoted, why don't you take a trip down to your nearest grassland, and try and eke out a living by eating seeds, and then come back and tell me how easy it is. 

taunting it seems common for soldiers to expose their butt or genitals prior to a battle as a way of taunting the enemy (e.g. the pissing champion of meereen). if this tradition became so common as to be expected, then you might have soldiers simply leaving their butt exposed as a show of bravery (cf. the red barron painting a bright red target on his plane). 

short answer: all rivers between a lake and a sea will flow to the sea basically, if the sea can flow into an area (e.g. a lake), it will quickly fill that area and stop flowing. rivers constantly flow into the sea because the sea is constantly evaporating away due to it's huge surface area. there are exceptions, but they are far less common than the standard rain to river to lake to sea paradigm. just for fun, i'll list some exceptions: 

some rivers end in a salt lake, salt flats or salt marsh. the water flows into the salty area, then evaporates away leaving behind the salt and other sediment. this area might not be called a "sea" if it isn't a large enough body of standing water. some rivers will flow "backwards" at high tide. nearly all rivers do this to some extent. they generally don't flow backwards long or hard enough to actually reach an area called a "lake". after earthquakes, it may take a short time for the sea to flow into a newly created depression. this situation generally resolves within a few days. 

Would the people become 10x heavier? If so, drowning becomes a serious risk, as these hypothetical humans would obtain a much smaller percentage of their needed swimming-force from their buoyancy, and being 10x stronger would not save them. (Ex. Suppose that normal humans are 10% denser than water, and are twice as strong as they need to be to tread. Aka, they can tread 2*10%= 20% of their own weight. Therefore, your hypothetical humans would also be able to tread 20% of their own weight, but now buoyancy only provides an additional 10% of their weight. Meaning they have only 30% of the necessary force, and are not nearly strong enough to swim). If the people stay roughly the same weight, then they become much more dangerous to each other and themselves. They can now jump about 3 times as high, greatly increasing the risk of landing badly. A toddler could easily push you out of a window. And it becomes impossible to subdue somebody without using weapons, as one small kick from them will launch you(and them) into orbit, meaning that cops and bouncers will favor the use of deadly weapons. 

I think a major drawback to birds wearing armor, is that they most likely will not be able to armor their wings. Wings need to be in contact with the air to work properly, so wing armor would need to be at once skintight and offer projection. Metal is out of the question, as are almost all man-made materials. Maybe a thin film of kevlar could work, but that's about it. Birds are more than 50% wing by area(and the larger the bird, the higher the percentage), and probably most vulnerable at the wing. So individual bird-armor seems unrealistic. However, I don't think this entirely rules out armor, just individual bird armor. Several birds would be able to carry a large cloth capable of stopping most projectiles, providing tactical cover for other birds to shelter behind(the cloth can be extended upward with wire so it protects the birds carrying it). These cloths would be like mobile trenches, and battles might turn into encirclement contests between these mobile defenses. You could add slits to fire projectiles through. You could get creative, either way I think this is how bird armor is going to evolve. Some birds will carry the armor, while others will perform combat function. Individual armor just doesn't seem to make much sense. 

1066~1440 CE before the normans conquered england in 1066-1072ce, the residents of england spoke a language called "old english", which is arguably more similar to modern german than modern english (e.g. Beowulf 700~1050ce). so, before 1066 you would have almost no chance of understanding anyone without significant study. after the normans conquered england, the conqueror's "old french" mixed with the commoner's "old english" to form a new simpler language we today call "english". that said, it took a few generations for the languages to mix, so in 1073 you would be just about as lost as 1065, but by 1300's things would start sounding familiar (e.g. the canterbury tales from 1386). still, without modern printing, dialects varied widely between towns, classes and generations. in fact, a typical uneducated serf would have a gruff german vocabulary you would consider rudimentary, while an "old money" noble conversation would sound closer to french and might actually include a few french or latin words. it wasn't until the printing press was invented in 1440 that the english language started to unify and stabilize into what we would recognize as "modern english" (e.g. asop's fables from 1484, typeface notwithstanding). so, listening to an educated person speak in 1450 london would be almost perfectly intelligible. you might need a few days to get used to their accent, word choice and world view, but the vocabulary and grammar would be perfectly serviceable to discuss most topics. futher reading: $URL$ side notes: you must keep in mind that the culture of pre-modern england was very different from today. on the one hand, without mass transportation, most people lived their entire lives within 40km of their home. with no dictionaries, they expected to have difficulty communicating with anyone who lived more than one village away. as such, they would probably be more adept at bridging the dialect gap than you. in a big city like london, you could probably find someone you could understand quickly. on the other hand, rural strangercide was much more common, and they might just kill you rather than try to figure out why you left your previous home (presumably not by choice...). at the very least, once the local lord determined you did not belong to any other lord, he would probably try to force you to work his land rather than accept the preposterous premise that your knowledge could be more valuable than your muscles. even today, you can see the upper/lower class french/german split in distinctions like a restaurant's "beef" (french bœuf) vs a farmer's "cow" (german kuh). or lower class german expressions like "blow up" vs upper class terminology such as "explode".
