If you've got superluminal drives, then you've got time travel. In a relativistic universe, those are just two different ways of talking about the same capability. So if your galaxy is 30,000 light years across then every decade or so you map it as it was 30,000 years ago and then send the map back in time by 30,000 years to the people who need it. 

No, it’s utterly implausible. A mutant isn’t a person with special powers, it’s a person with a genetic disease, varying from trivial to fatal depending on the nature of the mutation. A very very few mutations give some selective advantage and enter the general gene pool of the species, but your screamers need a completely impossible number of different favourable mutations. 

In the northern hemisphere, the winters would be a bit colder and the summers a bit hotter. In the southern hemisphere, it would be the other way around. It wouldn't be a big effect, as you can tell from the fact that seasons work pretty much the same in the northern and southern hemispheres at present despite the Earth being closer to the sun in the northern winter and southern summer. 

To deal with a linguistic point first, you can't have anywhere with 2.5 hours of daylight but no noon, since noon is simply the middle of the period of daylight. Kiruna in Sweden right now has 2.5 hours of daylight and probably a similar period of dusk, because it's close to the Arctic Circle and it's midwinter And there's life in Kiruna. The short period of daylight won't last long, of course. But if your planet has a similar axial tilt to the Earth but circles a very large star at a very large distance, it could have a much longer year so that the far north has an extended period of little daylight (or no daylight, within the Arctic Circle). Life would evolve to cope with it. Try reading the Helliconia trilogy by Brian Aldiss, which is set on a world like this. You do have a problem. Very large stars have a very short life, not long enough for complex life to evolve on their planets. 

Ctalul is too close to Darstan to have a day that's different from its orbital period -- it will be tidally locked. For example, Iapetus is tidally locked to Saturn despite being much further away, with an orbital period of 79 days. 

Pure silver is too soft for most of the uses that you list. If it's impure, then silver is not the only metal they've got access to -- they've also got whatever the silver is alloyed with, which they can extract and purify in its own right. 

Tell the scientists about nuclear fission, but also tell them it has been proved in your time that a fusion explosion would ignite the Earth's atmosphere, and so it was never done. There was in any case some concern about that possibility during the development of fusion weapons and before the first test, and hopefully your input would be enough to prevent fusion weapons from ever being developed and tested. 

They would die. Nitrogen is an essential component of protein, and if you lose 2/3 of the protein in your body, you are dead. 

Yes, if there was bacterial contamination in the vial. The human DNA won't do anything, but any bacteria that are in the vial might manage to survive and reproduce. 

A technical development can't change the law. The development of cultured meat might lead to pressure for a change in the law, but could not itself make real meat illegal. 

A 28˚C increase probably kills all life on Earth in the long run, except perhaps bacteria deep underground or in the upper atmosphere, because it turns the Earth into Venus. We're already very close to the inner edge of the habitable zone around the Sun, and such a big increase would push us over. The problem is that the upper atmosphere gets full of water vapour, which photodissociates into oxygen and hydrogen, and the hydrogen then escapes into space. Over millions of years, the Earth loses all its water. With no plant life, CO2 emitted by geological action is no longer removed from the atmosphere and we get a runaway greenhouse effect ending up with a dense CO2 atmosphere and a very hot surface temperature. 

As is usual for questions of this kind, the major effect would be an intensive re-evaluation of everything we think we know about the universe, since this would be obvious evidence of the supernatural. There's no way it could happen naturally. The physical effects would be secondary to the societal and psychological effects. 

There is no limit on how much damage a small light object can do if thrown fast enough. A pencil thrown at sufficiently close to light speed could destroy the Earth. 

In Vernor Vinge's novel A Deepness In The Sky, humanity measures time in seconds from a particular arbitrary date, which is commonly thought to be the first Moon landing but upon closer examination turns out to be 1 January 1970 -- the Unix epoch. There are no hours, days, weeks, months or years; just seconds, kiloseconds (about 15 minutes), megaseconds (about 10 days), and so on. 

You could try hydrogen sulfide. It's not stable in the long-term in an oxygen atmosphere, but it could be continually renewed from biological sources, and you don't need a high concentration. You can have it be either smelly or fatal, but not both, since fatal concentrations paralyse the sense of smell and so can't be smelled. You'd only need 1 part per million to make your planet smell very bad, or maybe 100 to 300 parts per million to be lethal. 

The traditional hand-wave to get you effectively unlimited energy (but not infinite energy, which would destroy the universe) is to say that it's based on extracting zero-point energy. Since no one has any idea how this might be done, no one can say that you're doing it wrong. 

You can't do it with a nuclear weapon. But you could conceivably do it with a particle accelerator more than a million times more powerful than the Large Hadron Collider. It's theoretically possible that the current vacuum state of the universe is only metastable, and a lower-energy vacuum state exists. A single event with sufficient energy could trigger the collapse of the current vacuum state to the lower-energy one, which would then spread at the speed of light destroying everything. But it would have to be very high energy, since cosmic ray collisions have been observed with energies a million times higher than we've ever managed with current particle accelerators, and those collisions have obviously not destroyed the universe. 

Nearly all known exoplanets, including pulsar planets, are quite close to their primaries with correspondingly short orbital periods, since we need several orbits worth of data to detect them. But for this question we want to go to the other extreme and consider planets as far away from their primary as possible, about which we don’t know very much since we’ve only detected a handful by direct optical imaging. It’s perfectly possible and indeed likely that a type II supernova will have gas giant planets at a distance of half a light year or more, and they will easily survive the supernova, but there’s no way we could detect them without millennia of data. We couldn’t even detect a gas giant planet of our own sun at that distance, and one or more may well exist. 

Working up Wikipedia's list of solar system bodies in size order, S/2009 S 1 seems to be the smallest body that meets your criteria (it's a moon of Saturn), and therefore the most likely to be an alien artifact (it's only 300 metres across). If you want bodies that people have heard of, Icarus is a reasonably well-known asteroid and is only 700 metres across. 

The tides and orbit only depend on the centre of gravity. If you had some infeasibly strong substance from which you could make an ellipsoidal moon with the same mass as our current moon, and you were to remove our current moon and replace it with the new moon with its centre of gravity in the same place and moving with the same velocity, then nothing would change. It would stay in exactly the same orbit and the tides would be exactly the same. It would just look a bit different. An ellipsoidal moon would experience tides differently, and would probably be more likely to tidally lock to its primary -- but our moon is already tidally locked to the Earth, so nothing would change there either. 

Neither. Evolution is about the interaction of organisms with the environment, and a change in the environment doesn't affect it. The only thing that could mess with evolution would be if every single individual had exactly two children, 100% of whom survived to adulthood to have their own two children, which is obviously never going to happen. 

It would need a large body to travel through the solar system, disrupting the orbits of the planets. A large rogue planet or brown dwarf star would be the most likely candidates. If it didn’t come very close to the Earth, which it wouldn’t need to, then it wouldn’t be particularly damaging to the Earth except for pulling it out of solar orbit. Underground bunkers with nuclear power and hydroponics could keep going more or less indefinitely. Some life would also remain around deep ocean geothermal vents, since the deep oceans would be insulated by the ice above them, and the Earth would remain geologically active. In theory it could eventually suffer the reverse catastrophe, but it would take hundreds of thousands of years at the fastest, and would be very very unlikely. 

No, it's not a stable setup. You've got the planet at the two stars' L1 point, but that's dynamically unstable, and when it drifts away it will tend to drift further. Only the L4 and L5 points are dynamically stable, and so they're your only options for a planet that's linked to two stars in this way. 

Either the land is surrounded by water and swamp for much of the year but it dries out enough to cross in summer, or it's surrounded by water all year but it freezes over enough to cross in winter. Take your pick. 

Without intelligent intervention of some kind, whether technologically advanced human, alien or divine, this simply isn't possible. Oxygen is highly reactive, and thus any substance that was available on the Earth to react with it and take it out of the atmosphere would already have done so. And there's a lot of oxygen in the atmosphere, so it will take a correspondingly large effect to remove enough of it on your desired timescale. 

What do you mean by a "region"? I think it's safe to say that the Siberian Traps were pretty hot for the million years or so that they were erupting. And in general, volcanic or geothermal activity is a better way to get a very hot region than climatology. 

There’s no particular reason to believe that an AI would make a good warship crew. It would be walking a very fine line between being smart enough to be as effective as a human crew, and being smart enough to immediately desert. Or the three laws of robotics may apply, or the society may value AIs equally with humans (e.g Iain M Banks’s Culture) and not want to put them in harm’s way. 

Look at David Weber's Honor Harrington series. It's heavily concerned with space combat, mostly using missiles. But most of the missiles in the series are drones by your definition -- they don't close to point-blank distance and explode, they close to stand-off distance and emit a bomb-pumped laser beam at the target. That's because close-in point defence systems are good enough to destroy missiles that close to point-blank range, but not good enough to destroy drones closing to a few million miles away.
