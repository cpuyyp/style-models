As noted in comments and other answers, the principle of explosion is not applicable in this case so the first answer is invalid. You probably had in mind the fact than in logic, "if A then B" is trivially true when A is false. But that doesn't apply to counterfactuals. Your sentence is not "if there are two moons, ..." but "if there were two moons, ...". That makes all the difference! Simple propositional logic is not the proper tool to analyse conditionals. It is a tool to talk about what is actually the case, not what would possibly be the case. Thus your (1) is an incorrect answer but your (2) can still be considered. As noted by virmaior, counterfactuals can be analysed in terms of possible worlds (and modal logic is the right tool for that). However before talking about possibilities and impossibilities we must specify what possibilities are at stake: are they technical possibilities? Physical possibilities? Logical possibilities? Take the following statement: "I am now in New York, but I could be in Paris within a few minutes." Well no, this is technically impossible. However it is physically possible since I wouldn't exceed the speed of light. Only the technology is missing. I could add to the sentence "if I had the technology to travel that fast" and the sentence becomes true. Or just imagine the sentence pronounced by a Star Trek character, and it becomes true. And if you stick only to logical possibilities you can even break the laws of physics if you wish! What this example intents to show is that counterfactual talk is very sensitive to the context and that the truth value of a counterfactual depends on additional assumptions. What the context fixes is a set of rules regarding what can change or not from possible worlds to possible worlds, i.e. what is necessary or not. Generally, locutors assume something like a ceteris paribus clause (all things equal), which means that you should change the minimum possible to render the counterfactual true: all the rest should remain fixed. A ceteris paribus clause could help understand how one would typically respond to your example questions: if there were two moons, but all the rest remains unchanged: poets are inspired alike by moons, etc. If I were rich, but my personality, desires, tastes remained the same. That explains why your (2) is inappropriate. (2) assumes that the only relevant rules regarding what remains unchanged in other possible worlds are the laws of physics. It's not how people generally understand counterfactuals: thay assume a maximum set of things remain true in these other possible worlds. This is also why counterfactuals depend on the context (while physical laws are not contextual). If you want authors who reflected on counterfactuals, you can have a look at David Lewis for example, or Maudlin's "metaphysics within physics" (more about laws of nature, but there are parts about counterfactuals). 

Personally I don't think any of these reasons are good (although some are not so easily rejected) and we can discuss that in comments if you want. 

I tend to share your puzzlement. A lot of contemporary metaphysicians seem to have an outdated view of physics, not only about determinism but also about locality or mereology (this was criticized by Ladyman and Ross in "everything must go") . I think the main reasons are the following: 

I cannot answer for the historical aspect of the question (I don't know enough Spinoza) but I would say that today it is generally assumed that the universality of laws is analytic: laws are always and everywhere the same by definition, otherwise they're not laws but local facts (whether there are indeed true laws of nature in this sense is another question). Regarding modern physics: it's important to distinguish between universality and unification. Physics is not unified because we have more than one theory to reflect different aspects of the universe, but each theory purports to be universal in its application. In particular, both QM and GR apply always and everywhere. 

Idealism is certainly sceptic about the existence of an external world, but not about truth generally: idealists will construe truth as a matter of coherence of one's representations rather than correspondence to the world (a belief is true if coherent with our whole set of beliefs--this is kind of holistic). 

Basically, your question concerns the content of perception ("what we perceive"). As explained here, "content" can be understood in two senses, as in "the content of a bucket" or "the content of a story". You seem to imply the first sense in your question, where the content of perception would be "what is in the mind when we perceive something" (you say "our brains representation of objects"). Some philosophers hold this view as well, but there are reasons to think that the second sense is more appropriate, where, so to speak, perceiving is representing something outside (and it's not, literally speaking, the brain that represents, but the perceiving agent). In this second sense, the content of perception is, as in "content of a story", some external state of affairs, and it is closely related to belief. As explained in the entry linked above, there are reasons to adopt this understanding if one accepts that perception can be falsidical (we see a fish, but there's no fish). In this view, we perceive (=represent) external objects directly. This does not mean that we perceive them "as they are" though. Applied to light, there's a further step because even if we perceive "brightness" (conceived of as an external, objective state of affairs) this does not mean that we perceive "electromagnetic radiations" (or their amplitude). The further step is a reductionist account that would entail that brightness just is (amplitude of) electromagnetic radiation. But once the first step is assumed, this question is just a question of reduction and is independent of perception and less problematic. Now you can still deny that perception has content in the "story" sense, and distinguish perception and judgement, as some philosophers do. Then perhaps we do not perceive electromagnetic radiations. You can find references in the entry linked above. 

Kripke formulated an argument against the identity theory (between mental and physical) which is similar in spirit to Chalmers' zombie argument, but he did not use philosophical zombies explicitely. His argument is based on rigid designation (the fact that names are used, in natural languages, as if they were refering to essences, or necessary properties, possessed in every possible world) and the necessity of identity (if a is identical to b, it is so in every possible world). He concludes that if pain were identical to a physical brain state, it would have to be necessary so, but it is perfectly conceivable that a feeling of pain exist without the corresponding brain state (or the converse). Therefore pain is not identical to a brain state. The argument faces the same kind of objection than Chalmers', in particular: why should we infer metaphysical possibility from conceivability?

Galileo's argument shows that the magnitude which determines the speed of free fall must be intensive, not extensive. In the case of charges, the relevant magnitude is charge per mass unit. Same in the case of cross sections: it is cross-section per mass unit. These magnitudes are intensive. When attaching two objects, you double the resistance of the air, but you also double inertial mass, so the two objects will not fall slowlier or faster than each separately (contrarily to what you are saying). Galileo's argument remains valid in this case. Idem in the case of charges attracted by a magnet: two charges won't be attracted faster when tied together, because inertial mass adds up as well as charge. The premiss on which the argument rests is that a continuous change in the arrangement of a situation cannot produce a discontinuous change in the dynamics of these arrangement (change an arrangement a little and the dynamics should change a little). If an extensive quantity is involved in movement then the principle fails: there'd be a discontinuity between the dynamics of two spheres with an infinitely small gap and two connected spheres, which seems absurd. In conclusion: you might quibble on the formulation, but given this premiss of continuity of change, Galileo's argument is sound. EDIT: perhaps the argument is even more general and does not depend on continuous change. Consider a composite system S1+S2. The extensive magnitudes of S1 and S2 will add up while the speeds of S1 and S2 won't (you'll take average speed for the composite system). Insofar as nature's behaviour does not depend on how you name and group things, extensive magnitudes cannot be directly relevant for movement.
