In your example, whether His boss is analysed as a DP or as an NP with the noun boss as head, the possessive his does not c-command John (you are mistaken in this respect), which, as a consequence, is 'free' and satisfies Principle C of Binding Theory, as all r-expressions must. What Principle C says is only that r-expressions must not be c-commanded (and therefore automatically 'bound') by any co-referential expression, be it in the same 'binding domain' (the clause, in this case) or in a higher one, but that does not block co-reference between his and John: as his does not c-command John, it cannot bind it either (= make John obligatorily co-referential with it). Principle C allows his and John to not be co-referential; it by no means forces then to be non-coreferential, a very different claim. In consequence, in your example the possessive his may indeed refer to the same individual as the noun John does (= John, in that case), but it need not; it may also refer to any other male individual. The only r-expression that does c-command John in your example is His boss, but His boss cannot possibly be interpreted as referring to the same individual John does; if it could, the r-expression John would automatically be 'bound', in violation of Principle C of Binding Theory, and to save the sentence it would be necessary to replace it with the matching reflexive himself, according to Principle A. 

Obviously, in cases like Greg Lee's above, a non-finite clause introduced by the 'complementizers' with or without simply cannot be controlled, because 'Control', as defined in GB, P&P and subsequent Chomskian metatheory, does not apply to 'referential' NP/DPs like the onlookers, which, by definition, must be autonomous in reference (recall Principle C of Binding Theory), but, assuming you are interested only in non-finite predications containing PRO subjects, the answer is still No, non-finite adverbial clauses do not have to be 'controlled', because their PRO subject can - if only in exceptional cases - be arbitrary in reference, as in e.g. PRO Talking about serious matters now, what do you think of Trump's attitude towards Russia and Putin? Of course, in all the examples you provide in your question (and you could have added predications apparently consisting only of PPs, NPs, etc.), PRO subjects are controlled, and they are controlled by the subject of the 'main clause', but there is no choice: such PROs cannot be controlled by NP/DPs in any other position, because 'control' requires c-command and no NP/DP can c-command a detached adjunct from any lower position than that of subject. As to whether Green with envy, Bound in leather, etc. could be analysed other than as bare (or 'small', 'reduced', 'verbless' etc.) 'clauses' (i.e.,'predications'), I agree with you that, from a Chomskian perspective, they cannot, but, even if, according to some other grammatical metatheory, they could be considered detached 'predicative' APs (PPs, NPs, etc.), instead of 'clauses', the fact would remain that green, bound, etc. are 'open', one-place 'predicates', and, unless a 'predicate' has a 'subject' argument, it is, by definition, 'unsaturated' and uninterpretable (in the sense that any unvalued variable makes the value of the function undefinable). Hence, even if other grammatical metatheories are entitled to object to 'empty' categories like Chomsky's PRO, they still have to say somehow that the 'external' argument of green, bound, etc. (or its theta-role) is 'discharged' ('satisfied', 'saturated',... you name it) by the entity referred to by the subject of the main clause, which makes such alternative solutions and Chomsky's original one mere notational variants of each other at best! (i.e., provided the alternative solutions represent co-reference, c-command restrictions, and other principles of Control Theory in terms comparable in rigor and accuracy to Chomsky's own). 

By policy, UNICODE does not assign code points for contextual variants. Some contextual variants are in by exception—their purpose is to guarantee round-trip equivalence with some older legacy standards that were in existence before UNICODE. So you should go with the single code point for ARABIC LETTER DOTLESS FEH (U+06A1) and let the typesetting engine do the contextualisation. When the engine does not reproduce the handwriting faithfully, you can hint the contextual variant using one of the two characters ZERO WIDTH JOINER and ZERO WIDTH NON-JOINER. EDIT: This means in particular, that you should not use the available contextual variants for encoding the Arabic script and treat them as deprecated or compatibility only characters. 

We don't have records of spoken Latin, but there are some works (e.g., the commedies of Plautus) that are less formal and more colloquial than others. AFAIK, there are no grammatical divergences in Plautus from classical Latin of his time. 

Formally, Latin has perfect imperatives, too. They are very rare and usually only used with verbs that exist only in the perfect stem, like meminisse "to remember" with the imperative forms memento! and mementote! 

A historical approach to phonetic alphabets, Alexander Bell's Visible Speech, used rotations systematically. The Canadian Aboriginal syllabics (mentioned in Sumelic's comment) is an example for a script systematically using rotations in practical use. However, you can't do it in an alphabet based on the Latin alphabet, because of pairs of letters like (n, u) or (b, q). The letter "o" is invariant under rotation and not usable in such a font. IPA created new letters by rotation, but this is done arbitrarily and without systematic meaning of rotation.

Inspired by this question Which Indo European language best preserves the features of Proto Indo-European?, I want to ask the follow-up question: What did we learn for the reconstruction of Proto-Indogermanic from the Tocharian languages? The proto-language was already well fleshed out before the discovery of the Tocharian inscriptions. Did their discovery bring up some new insights? 

If 'something similar' to Latin -que is good enough for you, present-day Spanish conmigo contains an old preposition or prepositional clitic suffix -cum hidden under the current from -go. [Our conmigo actually derives from cum mecum, where the -cum part of mecum was originally an adposition/a syntactic affix meaning 'with' arguably similar to the -que clitic meaning 'and'. That construction was, of course, redundant, a remnant of the stage at which late spoken Latin was becoming a head-complement language, what Romance languages soon were to develop into, but still contained important residues, mainly in VPs and PPs, of the earlier complement-head phase]. Less obviously, present-day Spanish quisqui, as in todo quisqui (= every body), cada quisqui (= each person), is a reflex of Latin quis-que (originally perhaps = somebody else). 

The existence of adjectival or adverbial complements of prepositions is very improbable on purely conceptual grounds, because a) all true prepositions are two-place predicates, b) by definition, a predicate must take one or more arguments as its complements (broad sense, 'subjects' included), c) arguments must be encoded by referential expressions (names referring to 'entities', including time intervals, space regions or states of affairs) and d) both adjectives and adverbs are themselves predicates (of 'nominal' expressions in one case, of verbal or 'extended verbal' projections in the other), not arguments (note that they name nth-order properties, not individuals or situations). Hence, all, or the great majority of, the cases of P+Adj or P+Adv you might think of if you just look up the part of speech of words in commercial dictionaries are not real adverbs (or adjectives). Typical examples are words like yesterday, today, tomorrow, now, then, here, there,... traditionally considered adverbs, but long ago reanalysed by serious syntacticians as NPs or deictics pointing to temporal or spatial regions. In some cases, their nominal character becomes obvious as soon as you consider that they may take genitive inflections (cf. yesterday's/today's/tomorrow's newspapers). In others (now, then, here, there,...) that evidence is not available for purely morphological or historical reasons (e.g., Modern English deictics do not inflect for case). As to apparent P + Adj constructions, the evidence for 'nominal' status of the adjective is perhaps less compelling, and in some cases, there is no obvious analytical alternative yet, but some of those adjectives are the reflexes of translations from Latin (where 'altus'[> high], for example, was both an adjective and a noun meaning 'heaven' amongst other things), or nominalizations of a special kind (e.g., the use of guapo or listo in Spanish expressions like ir de guapo por la vida, pasarse de listo, etc.). Apart from that, in many cases, the would-be P+Adj constructions have been re-analysed (at least within certain syntactic theories) and there is evidence that what seemed to be a preposition is not really such, but an 'inflectional' category or a complementizer (e.g., in English, the as or the for of consider somebody as intelligent, or take something for granted, etc.). In general, thus, given the conceptual difficulties that the mere existence of P+Adj constructions raises, would-be cases of adjectival complements of prepositions probably result from the fact that most grammars have not yet analysed such constructions in sufficient depth, or, if some have, due to the fact that commercial dictionaries are very reluctant to change the 'part of speech' attributions that Greek, Latin and mediaeval grammarians established centuries or millennia ago and that remain in use in the elementary school grammars by which most of us learn the little we know about the syntax of our native languages.

Heterographs, as you call them, are pretty common. German uses spelling to differentiate word pars like Lerche/Lärche, Lied/Lid, fiel/viel, mehr/Meer, Mohr/Moor, mahlen/malen; French differentiates a/à, ou/où, etc. Heteronyms, as you call them, also occur in other languages, German has the nice doublet Montage (Mondays/assembly, installation, mounting). German also has some ambiguous compounds like Wachstube (Wach-Stube or Wachs-Tube) or Staubecken (Stau-Becken or Staub-Ecken). I think specially heteronyms are more frequent in English than in any other language I know. This has to do with the age of the established orthography and the on-going evolution of the spoken language leading to a gulf between spoken and written language. 

Probably the closest thing coming to your question are the Greek Numeral signs Stigma and Digamma (6), Qoppa (90), and Sanpi (900) that aren't used as letters anymore, but have uppercase and lowercase forms. There are also uppercase and lowercase Roman Numerals. Note that bicameral scripts are rare (compared to the number of writing systems), there are only three fully bicameral scripts (Latin, Greek, and Cyrillic), and one that once was bicameral (Georgian). [I don't know how bicameral Glagolitic is, at least it has both cases in Unicode.] 

Some examples for the German language (with links to maps!): The word Jause is an Austriacism and is rarely found outside the Austrian borders. The word Broiler still reflects the boundary between Eastern and Western Germany; note also the word Poulet being restricted to Switzerland, Alsace, Lorraine and Luxembourg on the same map. Also the word Topfen is becoming more and more an Austriacism, loosing ground in Bavaria to Quark. Lower level boundaries between different states of Germany can be seen in this map: Different states of Germany use different terminology for written school exams. Here, Bavaria is sticking out. 

In modern English, certain (but not, or not yet, all) 'time-interval-in-which-event-occurs' adjuncts can be constructed apparently (1) without temporal prepositions or case inflections (as in I received the money this morning/yesterday/last Friday/this week/last month/this summer/this year, etc.). The same construction occurs, although not exactly in all the same cases, in modern Spanish, several other western IE languages, and Mandarin. How common this construction is in Human Language, in general, I do not know, though. Could somebody here give me examples of languages - preferably IE ones, since I know virtually nothing about other language families - in which this 'bare NP adverbial' construction is also possible, and, especially, of languages, if any, in which it is not? (2) Thank you. (1) Please note my 'apparently': I am not saying that English or Spanish 'bare' NP time adjuncts are really 'bare' (i.e., lacking even 'covert' prepositions, phonetically null K(ase)-assigning functional heads,'inherent', lexically-conditioned Case-features, or whatever structural devices eventually account for their function and interpretation); all I meant to say is that at PF they seem to be mere uninflected NP's/DP's, rather than PP's, K(ase)P's, or Case-inflected NP's/DP's, and what I wanted to know is which other languages have this surface property and which, if any, do not. I know, though, that the question might be undecidable (for reasons briefly explained in note (2) below). (2) Needless to say, the construction will be trivially impossible, by definition, in any language in which all 'bare NP' time adjuncts must carry overt case inflections (accusative, genitive, dative, instrumental,...), as might well be the case in German, Russian, Polish, Hungarian, Finnish,...Latin (but I am not sure whether, in such languages, literally all 'bare NP' adjuncts must be overtly inflected; maybe some needn't be). [Note that, at bottom, this uncertainty may turn into a theoretical issue, instead of a factual one, because the possibility cannot be discarded that even apparently uninflected NP's should after all covertly carry 'abstract' Case (e.g., whichever the 'default' Case may be in the corresponding language, say 'objective', in English). What's more, of course really 'bare' (here: prepositionless and caseless) NP's will be impossible on theoretical grounds if the 'Case Filter' is a correct principle of Human Language and applies to all NP's. However, even if it is, whether it must apply to all NP's, including (2nd. order) NP predicates, instead of just to argument NP's is unclear to me]. Such issues might make my question unanswerable, and I am ready to delete it if so considered, but my original intention was to leave them aside and just find out what other languages have 'bare NP' time adjuncts that seem caseless at 'surface structure/PF' and which, if any, prohibit them (possibly disregarding German, Polish, etc., if their 'bare NP' adverbials do, in fact, invariably require case-marked NP's, which, as I said, I do not know). 

It lies in the nature of the participle in German that it combines verbal and adjectival aspects. There is a German name for the participle, Mittelwort, which is coined for this double nature. Having said that, it is conventional to regard the German participle as a form of the verb. The reason is, that it can be regularly derived from the verb and the the verbal lemma behind it is transparent and obvious. A few participles crossed the border to adjectives diachronically (this happened when the participle survived, but the main verb fell out of use; an example is the German adjective eigen). 

There is a diachronic tendency to drop the use of articles for some of the countries (Saarland, Iran, Irak) but not for others (die Schweiz, die Türkei) 

The German publisher Klett Verlag has bilingual dictionaries called "Thematischer Grund- und Aufbauwortschatz Englisch" (for English) and "Thematischer Grund- und Aufbauwortschatz Spanisch" (for Spanish) that may meet your criteria. They are directed at language learners, and the frequency data are not included in the dictionaries (but the organisation by semantic fields is well-done). 

Besides cognates, there are also chance coincidences (say, Maya vuh and German Buch "book") when clearly unrelated words have the same sound and meaning in different languages. 

For a human annotated corpus, there should be documentation available on the annotation scheme. In particular, you should already know whether the annotation "squash" refers to the sport or the fruit. When the documentation of the annotation scheme is lost, your outlined approach using category specific words for unclear categories looks valid. A topic model is an entirely different beast and I doubt that it will help you much for your particular question. A resource with semantic relationships (e.g., a WordNet, an ontology, or a thessaurus) can prove useful. 

This question is inspired by the comments to my answer on this question. Are there reversed affricates, i.e., fricatives ending in a homorganic stop, attested in any language of the world? What is the usual term for such kind of a sound?
