Göring, however, does not see things like this, and actually summarizes the plot of Orwell's yet to be written novell 1984: 

From the off: The phrase "Wir haben es nicht gewusst" is a lie. Many Germans have later admitted that the deportation and mass killing of Jews, Gipsies and political prisoners was a public secret. At first, it could well be that not everybody was equally aware, and yes, the German economy was headed in the right direction, and yes the Nazi regime did manage to create jobs, and instill on the people a lost sense of pride. So it's not unlikely that, at first, people were willing to subject themselves and others to the nasty sides of the regime. By the time the ghastly things that were going on had become this public secret, the Nazi apparatus had managed to infiltrate every aspect of daily life, though. There are recorded accounts of children that got sent home from school, and were expressly prohibited to attend classes until they joined the Hitler Jugend. Though this does not serve as justification, with the rise of fascism, there grew a sense of terror among the population, too: if they didn't contribute, that was seen as a sign of rebellion, and thus they, too, could fall victim. But that's just one of many reasons why the Nazi's could keep on doing what they did, and does not answer your question. For that, we need to go back to the end of WWI. Germany had capitulated, and was heavily punished (Treaty of Versailles). WWI was in part caused by the Germans wanting a part of the colonial pie that the rest of Europe were having (among other things of course) as you may know. While the Treaty of Versailles was said to be about making amends and repaying war damage to those countries involved, it also prohibited Germany to expand its borders (ie: no colonies). Do not underestimate the social trauma a nation can sustain when, already having had to admit defeat, being forced to forego the perks (colonies back then were seen as a nations right) other countries so happily grant themselves. A nation is a mass of people, and a mass behaves irrational and emotional (like a toddler). Tell a 3 year old it's done wrong, punish it and then tell it, it has to watch while other toddlers are eating its sweets, it'll cry, kick and scream. So there was a genuine feeling of betrayal and disgruntlement in Germany. There had also been a long tradition of antisemitism in Europe. Couple that to the rise of Communism (Russian revolution happened during WWI) and you have: Anger, Fear (of Communism) and a not-well-liked minority. That's an explosive mix, no matter how you look at it. All you need is a spark: a charismatic leader, preferable one that also manages to restore some of the national pride that the country in question seems to have lost. An interesting read in this respect is "The Nuremberg Diary". Gustave Gilber, an American psychologist interviewed Hermann Göring and wrote their conversation down: 

I'm curious about this convention. How did it develop and what was its intended purpose? Naturally, in a battle, any enemy should be "fair game", but if this convention was observed, it must have had a clear benefit to everyone. 

But did not give references or citations on this statement, and did not explain who was harbouring the refugees, what they had to do with Venezuela and the Netherlands, and how this led to an attack and overthrow of a foreign government.

My question was, how secret or well-known were these countries' involvement in this role? Did the general public (in Iran and in the West) know about this? Or did only "conspiracy theorists" believe that the US and the UK did this, initially? 

French used to have a status as working language for international institutions, somewhat like English today (or Latin in the past for Catholic Europe). This was the case around the time of the founding of Chalmers University of Technology (1829). It is not surprising if some universities during that time used a French motto. Today there are also universities and other institutions in non English-speaking countries that uses English motto, for example Erasmus University. From Wikipedia 

Disclaimer: As I was made aware of this by Drux' comments: my answer may lead some people to believe that I am in some way justifying people not intervening, or even actively participating in the Holocaust. If read the comments below, I hope it is self-evident that this is not the case. Just to be clear: I absolutely and unequivocally condemn any action that discriminates on the basis of religion and or race, be it in the past, present or future. My main interest, as far as history is concerned, is 20th century geo-politics. The question of how could this happen is one that we all ask about every genocide. What I tend to do (and attempted to do in my answer) is to shift that question to could this happen (again) today or is it happening again. Of course, when attempting to apply this very sensitive subject (WWII genocide) to modern-day politics, I recognize the fact that bad choice of words or phrasing can lead to misunderstandings. It also stands to reason that a 1-on-1 "projection" of past events onto the present is, by definition false/flawed. But the cliché of history repeating itself is, IMHO, not all together absurd. Anyway, it is not my intention to hurt people, I am not trying to negate or minimize any of the atrocities that were committed. My only goal is to communicate what I believe are genuine similarities between the rise of Nazi Germany and today's political tendencies/evolutions. And to avoid any further misunderstandings, let's not beat around the bush: I have no sympathies towards anything even remotely resembling fascism or (neo-)Nazism whatsoever. So if you are a neo-Nazi looking to recruit: try your luck at the local asylum, or try reading a book, instead of using it as a hammer. If the contents of my answer below offends anyone for any reason, do not hesitate to leave a comment, and I'll be happy to clarify whatever needs clarification, or edit my answer in accordingly. 

In the middle ages, Christian-held Spain were split into different kingdoms and realms. Before the eventual unification by the "Catholic Monarchs" (Ferdinand II and Isabela I), other kings have unified multiple kingdoms, but the kingdoms split again between children. For example: 

Muhammad I of Granada, the founder the last Spanish Muslim kingdom, was also known by the name "Ibn al-Ahmar" ("son of al-Ahmar") The dynasty he founded, the Nasrid dynasty, was also known as "Banu al-Ahmar" ("children of al-Ahmar"). It seems that ''ahmar'' simply means "red" in Arabic. How did Muhammad I and the dynasty come to be associated with these names? 

In the introduction of his translation to the historical novel Footsteps, the translator Max Lane (who is also described as a researcher on Indonesia) said that in the beginning of the novel, the book's hero: 

The Muslims of al-Andalus (Islamic Iberia) consisted of Arabs, Berbers and native Iberians who converted to Islam (+descendants). Were there significant social distinctions between the three ethnic groups? The official and literary language was Arabic and presumably everybody speaks it. But did they, for example, live in separate communities, speak in different vernaculars at home, or have distinguishable names, clothings or customs from each other? Did they intermarry? Or were they generally assimilated since they had the same religion? I'm interested in the period around the 10th century, e.g. during the Caliphate of Córdoba: long enough after the initial conquest, but still before the disintegration of the Muslim power. 

All things asside, but in the interest of correctness, this may not be Stalin's quote How about this one, by Jean Rostand: 

Leaders are indeed the ones that make out the policies, both domestic and foreign. It is they who stand to gain from conflict. Economic and geopolitical factors come into play, and quickly overtake humanitarian considerations. As far as the leaders of a country are concerned, human casualties become statistics, and are seen as part of the cost vs benefits analysis. Basically, it's as Joseph Stalin (allegedly) stated: 

When you speak of WWII and the Holocaust in particular, it stands to reason that the same "rule" applies: the people aren't actively asking for pogroms. But Göring continues: 

How could something like the Holocaust happen, and could it happen again? I'm afraid to say that I believe it can happen anywhere, and if it were to happen again in our life-time, we wouldn't realize it before it's too late, and even so: few of us would actually have the courage to step up and do something about it. A couple of books that are loosely related, in the sense that they touch on, or identify similarities between nazi- or communist dictatorships and current western foreign policies: Gore Vidal: Permanent war for Permanent Peace William Blum: Rogue State 

Even more worrying, though: this phenomenon is so inherent to human nature, we don't even notice it's going on all around us: After 9/11, Bill Mahr caught some slack for saying the suicide attackers were not cowards. At the same time, Howard Stern stated that America should choose "any Arab country, they're all harbouring terrorists, and just nuke 'em". Bill Mahr was fired, Howerd Stern wasn't. Look at the people who have used the quote: "You're either with us, or against us" in various forms here: Lenin (Communist), Mussolini (Fascist), George W Bush (US president), Hillary Clinton (US Foreign Secretary) and Vic Toews (Canadian public safety minister). Since the Communist and Fascist dictators, the phrase has always been used in a context of threads to national security, mainly terrorism. This threat is also used to justify mass surveillance, invasive searches in airport security, The patriot act (Christ, patriotism and (extreme) nationalism is in the name), active prosecution of whistle-blowers like Edward Snowden, and racial profiling. Now think about these things, and read the quote by Göring a second time: 

Edit: As promised, here are some scholarly sources that support this view: For example, Alexander Diener and Joshua Hagen wrote in Borders: A Very Short Introduction (Oxford University Press, 2012) 

The Netherlands attacked Venezuela in 1908, which resulted in the overthrow of Venezuelan President Cipriano Castro. According to the New York Times article Dutch at War with Venezuela, the Dutch said that attack was: 

During the 1991 Gulf War there were a lot of lopsided tank battles where such a large number of Iraqi vehicles got destroyed for very little Coalition losses. For example in the Battle of Norfolk about 750 Iraqi tanks were destroyed against 5 Coalition tanks destroyed (according to wikipedia). Before you answer "the Americans and the British had better training and tactics" or other high-level explanation, my question is more about how it physically happened? I have a hard time imagining a battle, with almost a thousand tanks on each side, where one side just destroyed the other with such impunity. Did the Iraqis get completely destroyed without having a chance of firing back? Or did they fire back but it did not really hurt the Coalition forces? Neither are easy to imagine when they had almost 1,000 tanks in one place. 

Also note that the border runs through a mountaineous area called the Tenasserim Hills, which acts as a barrier between the two states. 

The Christian Kingdoms of Spain were at intermittent wars with the Muslims and also with each other (e.g. see Timeline of the Muslim presence in the Iberian Peninsula which contains dates of major battles and wars). In addition, unlike France and England who could come up with some sort of truce while they went on Crusade, I don't think the Muslims of Spain would have granted any truce to respect their Christian rivals going on Crusade. Therefore, sending their leaders and warriors across the sea to fight someone else's war would have been a suicidal move for these kingdoms. 

I thought for sure I learned this in school, but I can't find any reference to it online. The basic idea I remember is that for one reason or another the Ayatollah and his followers believed furniture to be evil, or at least un-Islamic, and convinced his countrymen to burn all the furniture they owned. I searched Google trying to find explanations of the phenomenon (wanting to know the basis of the belief) and found not even a reference to it having happened. Did it happen? Did something similar happen (just chairs and not tables, for instance)? Is my recollection mistaken? 

Lucifer was not the name of the king in Isaiah 14. As your linked Wikipedia article mentions, it's debated which king of Babylon is referenced in the passage. It names Nebuchadnezzar, Nabonidus, and several Assyrian kings as possibilities. So where does "Lucifer" come from? So where did "Lucifer" come from? Let's look at Isaiah 14:12 in a literal English translation of the Hebrew: 

J. Edgar Hoover's FBI had a vendetta against Martin Luther King, Jr. They wiretapped him, threatened to expose his sexual misconduct, accused him of Communist sympathies, and even went so far as to send him a letter encouraging him to commit suicide (though some maintain it was just telling him to step down from leadership). It's easy to think that the FBI was just trying to discredit the civil rights movement as a whole, and that one of their castration strategies was removing the figurehead or fracturing the movement. But the account of William Sullivan, the author of the threatening letter, tells a different story, namely that he hoped they could bring Samuel Pierce to the forefront of the movement to minimize the shock of the removal of King. According to his autobiography, he wrote the following in a letter to Hoover: 

Note that bishoprics and cities are named but not where the borders are. In fact, the treaty doesn't seem to imagine that there are borders at all. Where are the limits of the "Bishoprick of Metz"? I assume that this is determined by local practices. Other provisions about who owns what are also in this manner. The Treaty of Tordesillas (1494) did famously define exact borders, but this method of definition were initially only used for territories and colonies outside Europe and not for Europe only. Not to mention the impossibility of marking the borders defined in that treaty. Compare with the modern day Treaty of Versailles: 

The Constitutional Revolution of Iran in 1906 resulted in a constitution that established a parliament and a constitutional monarchy. Interestingly, it was based on the Belgian constitution. Was there any reason that Belgium was particularly chosen as a model? There was a lot of constitutional monarchies in the West at that time. Belgium wasn't among the most prestigious or famous of them, and I couldn't think of any special similarities between Iran and Belgium. 

Has a such hypothetical scenario happened in any hereditary monarchy? Was there anyone who took the throne "temporarily", only to be later displaced by a better heir who were born after his/her predecessor's death? 

but did not explain what the "unfriendly acts" were. Wikipedia's Dutch–Venezuelan crisis of 1908 has slighly more details 

The use of Arabic was not restricted to Muslims either. Jewish author in the Islamic world, e.g. Saadia Gaon (d. 942) and Maimonides (12th century) wrote extensively in Arabic. Further reading
