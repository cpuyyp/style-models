The exact path is very different for each player. Many players will skip one or several of the following levels of the minor leagues. For college pitchers, often the first thing they must do is finish their current collegiate seasons. Here are the possible levels of professional baseball in most major league organizations: 

This article indicates (through an analysis of 100 leagues across several sites), that there is not a strong correlation between picking first or last and winning your league. 

Now, the fourth pick is still a pretty good player, and there is a pretty good chance that you are going to get the second or third pick. However, depending on the draft it may not be the kind of no-brainer that the top pick often is. Therefore tanking in the NBA is only a good strategy if you believe the draft is good enough that the top 3-4 players in the draft are potential franchise defining players. The question of "has any team ever purposely tanked" is an incredibly difficult one. Plenty of teams give up and trade major pieces at the trade deadline in both basketball and baseball. However, no player would admit to playing less than 100%, and coaches are often fired if their team performs poorly, regardless of the players they have on the team, so it's not in their best interest. So while management can, and will put teams in positions to fail, the players and coaches usually try to do everything they can to not be that last place team. A great example of this is interviews with Indianapolis Colts players this past year, they knew they were bad, and would be assured a new franchise QB if they had the worst record, but they also knew their jobs were at stake if they didn't at least try their hardest. And at the end of the year when they were the worst team in the league. Despite the fact that they were in position to draft a brand new franchise quarter back, they fired their GM. The players, coaches and management reiterated time and again that "there is no suck for Luck going on. The other thing that goes into the equation of whether or not to tank is the question of what do you owe the folks that pay the bills. Namely your fans and your television and radio contracts. If you trade away your best players, is the product that you put out on the floor for the last 30-40 games of the season worth the (often obscene) ticket cost your fans are paying? If they stop showing up because you are awful this year, will they re-up their season tickets next year? Even if you only get the 4th pick of the draft? Will your TV and Radio partners give you a poorer contract when it comes time to re-up if they know that you have a tendency to throw a season away for potential draft picks? In summary, it's an incredibly hard decision for management and ownership when it comes to the trade deadline about whether or not to trade away your best players and play for picks. But (at least on the public face) it's always a clear choice for players and coaches, play as hard as you can and try to win the games that you can. Unless as a coach you have a clear direction from management to sit your best players in the final couple of games, you will be trying to win what games you can so that you might actually get to keep your job at the end of the year. And as a player you're interest is in making sure that you put yourself in the best position to continue playing your sport, which means playing as well as you possible can. 

This really depends on your barrel shape and the angle at which you fire. The natural ballistic path of a paint ball (with nothing special done in the barrel), is to fly straight, and then down (really it's an arced trajectory that is the downward half of a parabolic curve). The downward motion is caused by gravity so the motion is governed by the basic ballistic equation. (d = vt-32.2t^2+h where h is the initial height in ft, t is time in seconds and v is initial (muzzle) velocity in fps and d is the distance in feet traveled at time t). This equation assumes you are shooting flat straight, however, if you are shooting up, then you need two factors in your velocity to account for the upwards and outward velocity, this can be determined using trigonometry. More complicated barrel configurations may have rifling that causes the ball to spin coming out of the barrel causing it to have angular momentum that counteracts the initial effects of gravity and give it a longer straighter trajectory (this is mostly to counter the wind though, not necessarily gravity) Other barrels put backspin on the ball which causes it to have angular momentum against gravity again allowing for a longer trajectory in the ballistic arc. Both of these motion types introduce spin on the ball and complicate the equations governing the ball's fall in a way that is not easy to write out an equation for (the basic ballistic equation is basically universal, the equations for these would not be). There are other factors that complicate the trajectory as well. The most notable factor is wind. If you are playing indoors, this is probably not a concern, but outdoors, especially in windy conditions can make shots very wild and must be compensated for. 

Yes. Saves and holds, like wins, are wholly dependent on the score and do not account for whether or not a run is earned or unearned. The save rule's first clause is the one clearly in play here 10.18.a 

The lottery system makes it very difficult to effectively tank your season in the NBA. Basically no matter how bad you are, there is always a chance that you will not get one of the top 3 picks (in fact, the worst team in the league has rarely been awarded the top draft pick). Here are the odds that the worst team in the NBA gets a pick at or better than the current pick, starting with pick 1. (assuming 2 teams do not tie for the worst record) 

As far as breathing goes, breath deeply, this will fill your lungs. The better your lung capacity, the lower your overall body density will be and you will float better. As far as being able to so something like float and play the violin, my guess is that this particular swimmer has a bit of help from her suit. It looks to me like there is a bit of air trapped in the legs. However, there is a great deal of practice involved even still. Wanted to address one more thing. If you're actually doing the backstroke (or back crawl), in the style of competitive swimming, then you shouldn't have much trouble floating (this isn't really floating per-se, it's swimming, which is different then simply being buoyant). This is because your motion should be a big part of what is keeping you on the surface, your kick should create plenty of upward motion and should keep you on top of the water. 

The simple answer here is that you cannot trade draft picks because the trading of draft picks is not allowed by the collective bargaining agreement. The CBA for any American sport league lays out the terms on which the players and owners agree to run their sports league. It, along with unions and some other legal maneuvering are required in order to escape anti-trust regulations that are set up by the United States Congress to promote competition and limit monopolies. Because Sport Leagues are functionally monopolies there are special protections in place so that they can exist (primarily CBAs and Unions for players, coaches and officials) without serious legal repercussions. When players and owners cannot come to terms on a CBA you see the kind of legal maneuvering that the NFL and their players' association participated in last summer. Baseball just signed a brand new collective bargaining agreement before this current season that is good for a number of years. While that brought numerous changes to the draft, the trading of draft picks was not one of the changes that was made. 

Because of the nature of the collective bargaining agreement, starting pitchers are rarely treated any differently than any other player. There are some occasional differences between pitchers and position players (like the length of rehab stints). However, paychecks is not one of those places. They earn their checks based on the amount of time they are on the roster. MLB players get paid on the 1st and 15th, unlike in other sports that play weekly where you get paid weekly (like the NFL). Most MLB contracts are completely garunteed though so you get the full amount of your contract regardless of roster status (rookie contracts are different though). This means that in general, a players contract value will be divided up by the number of pay periods during the season (12 or so), and they would get paid that amount each check. 

The break and speed of these pitches vary quite dramatically so it's important for the catcher to know what's coming. The reason that a pitcher has so many pitches is so that he can vary the speed, rotation, location and break to the batter. If the batter knows what pitch is coming they can largely negate the advantage that the pitcher creates by being able to mix their pitches. Generally you want signs to be simple between a pitcher and a catcher. This is due to the fact that miscommunication with signals can lead to passed balls, wild pitches and even injury to the catcher. This means that most of the time it makes sense for the catcher and pitcher to communicate via a simple system. The catcher shows the sign between his legs and the pitcher either nods to accept the sign or shakes his head to tell the catcher to change pitches. Then the catcher places his glove in the intended location and that becomes the target location for the pitch. However, this is not the whole story. The catcher is generally not just calling pitches. Generally pitch selection is either the result of prior planning and discussion with the pitcher (they will generally meet before a game to work on how to get specific hitters out). Or the pitches are relayed by the manager or pitching coach from the dugout to the catcher and then to the pitcher. Some specific situations where this system changes: 

On ticket sales alone in 2012-13 the Heat made 1.44 million per game. That said, the average NBA fan spends something like and additional $25 (the numbers for cost I see seem to indicate that it's tickets for 4 + ~$100 which then divided 4 ways gives us $25). The Heat regularly sell out regular season games and I'm sure they fill to capacity for these playoff games. The max capacity for their arena is listed at 19,600. Which puts combined concessions and parking at around half a million dollars per game. That means their revenue including concessions and parking comes in at least 2 million dollars per game (this is low considering they raise average ticket prices for playoff games). This suggests that by playing 2 extra home playoff games the heat brought in an additional 4 million dollars in revenue. However, this doesn't necessarily directly benefit the Heat. They are subject to a revenue sharing agreement with the league and as much as 30% of their profits may be shared. 

That's basically it, those are the four scenarios for a pitch, it's called a ball, it's called a strike, it's contacted by the batter and it hits the batter. 

First the basics. Baseball rosters are 40 men. There are three locations that a player on the 40 man roster can be.
