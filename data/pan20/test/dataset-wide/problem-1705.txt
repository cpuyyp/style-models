Use the TMPDIR environment variable to tell mysqldump where to put its temporary files, and point it to a writable location. 

Actually, your LDAP domain should probably just be , not . This is also known as the base name in format. You might want to do a to reconfigure your OpenLDAP installation accordingly. Then, use as the LDAP URI (don't include the domain on the end), and set Ldapadmin to use as the base. You may also need to specify a bind DN (which looks something like ) and a bind password in order to fully connect to your server. 

If I ping a VPN address from the Smoothwall box, it works. However, when I try to ping a VPN address from any other host on the local 192.168.65.0/24 subnet, I get a "Destination Port Unreachable" result. If I set a route on the local host to send VPN traffic directly to the 192.168.65.160 gateway, that works. It's only when I try to route VPN traffic through the Smoothwall box that it doesn't get through. What's going on? 

I've found that specifying "-O maxssf=0" on the ldapsearch command line is necessary in order for GSSAPI AD searches to work properly. The following command works for me to search the AD global catalog via a SSL connection: 

Also, in order for Kerberos authentication to work with ldapsearch, DNS must be properly configured for reverse IP lookups. If not, you'll get a "cannot determine realm for numeric host address" error. If necessary, you can put the IP and hostname of your AD server in your hosts file to get it working. 

I have a Smoothwall box set up as my main gateway at 192.168.65.1. I also have a Proxmox virtual server at 192.168.65.160 that I use to make outbound VPN connections. Since the Smoothwall box is the default gateway, I want to to set it to route all local 192.168.65.0/24 network traffic bound for VPN destinations (such as the 192.168.1.0/24 subnet) to the 192.168.65.160 address. Smoothwall is configured with /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward set to 1. The routing table is set as follows (eth0 = RED interface): 

One way of doing this is through path-based authorization. This way you could setup the archives to be viewed only by those people in your team. Here is a page from the Subversion Red Book about Path-Based Authorization: $URL$ You will be able to set the permissions using what's called an authz file. Just make sure to test this with different users. Play with the different settings. Once the authorization settings are to your liking, then you can open your firewall port to the WAN. Subversion has 2 servers, svnserve (svn:// protocol) and Apache-WebDAV (http:// protocol). I recommend that you use VisualSVN, if you choose the HTTP protocol. I have a product that handles the svnserve server. It's called PainlessSVN. There's a couple places where you may be able to get help. WanDisco Subversion Community Subversion Forums 

I'm currently using the free hMailServer for SMTP, POP3, and IMAP. It has been pretty solid in the couple years that I've been using it. I've run it on Windows 2003 R2 and Windows 2008 Standard and Enterprise. I'm using SquirrelMail for webmail. This is PHP, but it wasn't that hard to setup. This is free as well. The best commercial experience that I had with a non-Exchange server was MDaemon from Alt-N Technologies. It has the best OWA like UI, and it has a connector for Outlook, so that it thinks it is an Exchange server. The price for this server is not as much as others, but still too much for me. There are several other email servers: Open Source/Free 

There are many more servers out there. The ones I listed here are the ones I had tried at one point in the past. 

One way of getting this to work is to download a copy of SQL Server Express, and restore the backup there. Sometimes this doesn't work, so you could try downloading a trial version of SQL Server Standard. I think it has something like a 180 day trial. Once you got the database restored, then you can use your favorite ETL tools to move the data into PostgreSQL. 

There's no need to dump the password into an actual file. Just echo it with the -n flag to prevent the newline, then read it in from the STDIN file descriptor (/dev/fd/0) as follows: 

You can get a dump of the PHP environment by setting up a page with the following code and pointing your browser to it: 

Make sure that the "mydestination" parameter in /etc/postfix/main.cf includes the "localhost" value. Add the following line to /etc/aliases. Run "postalias /etc/aliases" after editing is done. This is what actually passes emails destined for "robotscript@localhost" to your PHP script. Your script should be set up to read the contents of the email from STDIN. 

Your RewriteRule directive is looking for the URL to start with either a forward slash followed by "secure_secrets" or only by "secure_secrets" - you don't mention the "~user" part anywhere. 

This can be accomplished by using recipient_bcc_maps to BCC all emails to a local-only address that is configured to route to your script. Add the following line to /etc/postfix/recipient_bcc. Run "postmap /etc/postfix/recipient_bcc" after editing is done. This tells Postfix to BCC all emails where the domain matches "@yourdomain.tld" to the "robotscript@localhost" address. 

Make sure to chmod the permissions to 0600 on that options file to prevent it from being viewable by anyone except the owner. Then your mysql command would be: 

First, make sure you have a line in your /etc/apache2/ports.conf file. Then try changing to in your config. 

It sounds like you may need to configure the refint overlay, which helps to maintain a directory's referential integrity in situations such as that which you described. There is a page at $URL$ which may be helpful towards setting up this overlay. 

Add the following line to /etc/postfix/transport. Run "postmap /etc/postfix/transport" after editing is done. This tells Postfix that emails destined for the "robotscript@localhost" address are to be delivered directly on this server, and not relayed elsewhere. 

Just set up a VirtualHost for my.drupal.com and configure its DocumentRoot to point to the directory in which you've installed Drupal. Then configure an Alias inside that DocumentRoot to point /vislab to the root location of the static content (which is in a separate folder from the Drupal files). Here's a brief example: 

My favorite utility is RAdmin by Famatech. My favorite feature is the ability to work behind NAT firewalls. It is mainly a remote control administration tool, but it has different connection "modes" that lets you work with the specific computer in different ways. There's another tool that I want to try, but haven't yet. It's called Network Administrator by IntelliAdmin. It will let you a lot of stuff in the background, without interrupting your users. These company also has several other useful tools. 

If you don't mind a commercial solution, there a business telnet client called TeSSH, that has a rich scripting language, and can be run from the command-line. It has support for writting scripts in vbs, perl, and lua. It's fairly inexpensive at $34.95. You can also visit the TeSSH Support Forums. 

I fought with this for a few weeks. Here are the settings that I'm using on 3 ASP.NET websites that use SMTP gateway to send their emails: Address: smtp.gmail.com Port: 587 1) The port is very important. You may have to enter it like smtp.gmail.com:587 in your SMTP server. I haven't touched Microsoft SMTP in years, so I can't remember what the setup screen looks like. 2) Make sure to enable SSL for SMTP, as gmail requires it. 3) SMTP Authentication should be set to Basic. 4) Make sure that you are using an actual email and not an email alias to authenticate. This one gave me lot of trouble. This is how I got it working. 

That looks like as if the Subversion server is not running. I've done that quite a few times myself. I've done this so much, that I created a page for me to look it up. I use the custom svnserve.exe server. If this is what you're using then look at the URL below for how to turn it into a Windows Service. $URL$ I've settled on the CollabNet binaries, as they have a nice install package for both the svnserve and Apache editions of the server. 

There are several ways that you can do this: Use a build server I've heard of teams using CCNET.net or FinalBuilder Server for this. Basically, what happens is that the build script has code to push the latest build, every time somebody makes a check in. I wouldn't recommend this for production though. This should work fine for a staging environment though. I'm not very familiar with build servers on Linux, but I know that there are a few. There's also Ant, and even Make scripts that could be used for this. Put a working copy on the staging server Just do a check out, and map the correct folder to be the root of the web app. Somebody on the team will have to manually update this working copy, but this gives you the flexibility to revert to a previous version if necessary. Caveats You'll need to make sure that you exclude the .svn folders when you pointing the website to the working copy. I wouldn't recommend using a Subversion hook script for this. You can pretty much use any scripting engine that available in Linux to do post-commit scripts. I typed "post-commit hook script linux" in Google, and got some good hits.
