I do believe the location, and this is my best guess, is the Military Armistice Building in South Korea. Exactly which armistice meeting (they've had quite a few now) it is, I am not sure. But it does look quite similar to the room in the photos. I cannot be certain though. [ [ [ 

So what Pieter describes is the political mechanism though which the French and British Armies were allowed onto Belgian soil. However the second part of your question seems to imply How did they physically get there?, which I would like to address. Transport and Supply in World War One So I was actually unable to find where the BEF disembarked in 1914. But what we do know is that they arrived at the front 3 days after the declaration of war. The BEF participated in the series of battles known as the Battles of the Frontier, quite notably the battle of Mons. My best guess is that the BEF disembarked in Calais from Britain and were then deployed in Belgium via rail. They then deployed from the railhead to fight the Battle of Mons before retreating. The rest as they say is history. I'll elucidate in a bit after dinner. 

So what we are able to tell from this source that the Russians used over 100 different ciphers, some of which we would can reliably infer would be poly-alphabetic, but in also many events either transmitted in the clear or: 

Another interesting point is that there were significant forces crammed into Galicia, despite the front being only 260km long, the Russians were able to achieve a decisive victory in a matter of months. The East Prussian campaign also offers another insight into how strategic imperatives influenced the prosecution of the campaign. Due to the unique shape of East Prussia being connected to the rest of the German state by the Danzig corridor, the Germans were simply unable to conduct a passive defence and used their rail networks and superior command control to execute a devastating counter offensive that utterly annihilated Samsonov's 2nd Army. Both the ability (or lack thereof) to control large armies and a lack of "strategic" space is what often caused a devolution to trench warfare. However, these factors alone did not drive a devolution into attritional warfare. We also know that the industrialization of warfare and Europe also presented difficult tactical and operational challenges that took officers on both sides some time to learn how to over come. The vast resources available to both the Allies and the Central Powers also ensured that the war was never going to be settled with short battles of maneuver. 

This, as is history's wont, a question with quite a few events leading up to it. Pan-Slavism - the ethnic element As mentioned in the comments on the OP, Pan-Nationalism was all the rage at the time. In response to the Frankfurt Assembly and the Unification of Germany some Slavs felt that their rights were in danger as a result: $URL$ Pan-Slavism never really took off for the Czechs, but in the Balkans were the Slavs had been dominated by the Ottomans and Austrians for centuries, the idea had great appeal and gained traction. The Balkan Slavs naturally looked to Imperial Russia, as the great "Slavic" power, as a natural ally; in turn the Russians saw them as allies against its two rivals, the Ottoman Empire and Austria. Orthodox Christianity Versus Islam - the religious element There was also the religious element. The Balkans had large Christian/Orthodox and chafed under their Muslim overlords. Russia, an Orthodox nation thus had strong cultural ties to the Balkans and many Orthodox Christians lived under Ottoman rule and were treated as second-class citizens. The Russians contended that the Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca granted them the right to protect Orthodox Christian in Turkey. This contention was one of the tensions that led to the Crimean War. 

As anyone can see, what Mr PewDie is wearing is khaki, not blue grey. It is not consistent with any uniform, although bearing the most resemblance to the 1938 British Battledress. It bears about as much historical accuracy as one could expect from somebody who streams video games on YouTube for a living. What PewPewDie is wearing is not a uniform, but a costume. I would expect that anybody who mistook it for any uniform in Nazi Germany is colourblind. 

Is the question: "Why did the Great Britain not assist Greek expansionism in the Aegean (specifically Asia Minor/Anatolia) at the expense of the Turks?" Well Jon Custer's comment that war-weariness on the part of the Allies played a role is true. None of the nations in the Entente had appetite for continuing a costly war. The Treaty of Sevres outlined the partition of Turkey which was concluded in 1920 The Treaty of Sevres However the Allied powers had begun secretly partioning the Ottoman Empire as per the Sykes-Picot agreement as early as 1915. Sykes Picot Agreement It would seem that Great Britain was also fully aware of the atrocities taking place in Anatolia by the Greek forces there as well. The British definitely felt that the Greeks had overstepped their mark in Turkey violating the concessions given to them at the conclusion of World War I. It is quite possible given that in 1919 the Ottoman government in Constantinople was under British control; the British wished to preserve the partition of the Ottoman Empire as per the terms agreed in both the yYkes Picot Agreement and Sevres Treaty The British notified the Greeks that they were in violation of the agreement sometime around June 1919 (see Title: Eastern Report No. 124 Author: Foreign Office Date: 12 June 1919 ) 

Title: Eastern Report No. 129 Author: Foreign Office 17 July 1919 So it seems clear that the British felt the Greeks had overstepped the mark, and they wholly intended to keep to the terms of the peace conference. It's quite possible as well that the British may have felt that the Greek acquisitions may have ended up conflicting with the Italian concessions in Anatolia. So the "why" is quite simply because the Greeks were already acting in contravention to the orders handed down by the Paris peace conference. That's just my overview of the situation. I'm sure there's more to be dug around once I can dig up the relevant Foreign Office and Cabinet Papers - of which getting the specific volumes is taking a tad more time than I have available. 

There were not. The unbroken line of defenses stretching across France was what drove a number of the strategic, operational and tactical challenges that led to the necessary revolutions in military science that ended the conflict, such as the use of tanks and coordinated artillery. It took a lot of trial and error though. It is pertinent to note in theaters where operational mobility was permitted, both sides attempted to make use of it. This includes Palestine, Prussia and Eastern Europe. 

Well it seems likely that he existed if that's what you mean to ask. When you say "give a modern historic outlook and the existence of the prophet" what do you mean? Wikipedia has a large number of sources $URL$ I certainly don't think that somebody simply made him up if that's what you mean to imply. If you wish to read about the early days of Islam (i.e Mohammad's life) it would seem you would be well served by following the sources in the Wikipedia article. It seems that there were lots of reference amongst the Byzantines, Jews and the Europeans to Mohammad and Islam in general. I am no expert on the subject, but given the impact he had on the Middle East (prosecuting war in the Middle East, siring children etc.) I would say his existence was far more established than that that of, say, Jesus of Nazareth. 

Said to two governors regarding the Civil Rights Act of 1964, according to then-Air Force One steward Robert MacMillan. As quoted in Inside the White House (1996), by Ronald Kessler, New York: Simon and Schuster, p. 33. $URL$ Apparently. 

I think more than anything the reasons were geopolitical expediency. For example Germany and Japan began rapprochement when they signed the Anti-Comintern Pact in 1936. At this time Hitler was looking for a reliable partner to contain the Soviet Union - and when the Chinese nationalists signed the Sino-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact, Hitler concluded that Japan would be a more reliable partner against the Soviets in East Asia. This was despite the fact that by 1938 Japan had not decided to expand north against the Soviets. The Japanese also felt driven closer to Germany as the United States placed greater export controls on the Japanese to deter further territorial expansion. It is also true that the Prussians and later Germans played a part in the industrialisation of Japan and the drafting of its Constitution. To quote wikipedia, From the signing of the Anti-Comintern Pact to the Tripartite Pact in 1940 

It's not specifically any uniform. Probably just something he picked up in a costume or surplus store. So the officers cap is a Service Dress Cap of the British Army style. However that horse pin/insignia on the front is meaningless, the symbol might be used in some militaries but the pin it self is obviously too plain/cheap to be part of any officer's dress. It's hard to tell whether it is just a cheap patch or a pin. Certainly not regulation. The Service Dress cap could be attributed to any number of Commonwealth/Dominion militaries at the time. Similiarly, the jacket could be of any number of types. It could be a British Service blouse, or an Ike jacket or any number of service coats; it could be simply a cheap brown jacket he ordered from China on ebay - it's simply too hard to tell with so little to go on. However, what's quite telling here is the rank insignia he has put on the epaulettes - two "gold" diamond insignia. Now these could be construed as the SS ranks of Oberfeldwebel (Oberfähnrich OA/ Offiziersanwärter) but as we can see from the colouring on that page - it's completely wrong. The colours on the epaulette and collar were just as indicative of what that soldier or officers MOS and rank were as much as the insignia. 

This article from The Economist lays out some great texts that cover a lot of aspects of the war, and is worth perusing if you are looking for further read on the topic. 2 This article also outlines how many battles on the Eastern Front were battles of maneuver rather than attrition. Simply put, the Eastern front allowed opportunities for maneuver that the West did not. $URL$ [please not this answer is only a first draft, and it is 3am here, and I'm having a glass of wine, typing on a keyboard without a space bar - I do apolgise for what is in my mind a rather terribly written post - expect it to be revisited over the next 24 hours.] 

In 1875-76, as a result of deteriorating Ottoman administration in the Balkans a Bosnia, Bulgaria and Herzegovina revolted against the Ottoman Empire. Serbia also declared war on the Ottomans on the 30th of June in 1876. Russia, justifying its position on the grounds of "fraternal allegiance" under Pan-Slavism, also declared war, beginning the Russo-Turkish War 1877-1878. Thus the Great Eastern Crisis was under way. 

To frame what the OP is asking the question is "Why didn't the Eastern Front devolve into an attritional conflict like the Western Front?" we need to examine what were the tactical and operational reasons for the devolution of warfare into stalemate. The two obvious and interrelated causes are: 1. Space and 2. Command and Control. Space: By the beginning of 1915 warfare on the Western Front had devolved into a stalemate as a result of the Race to the Sea which meant there was no potential for maneuver to achieve the upper hand. However this was not unique to France, and we can see the same result for example in the Dardanelles Campaign. The terrain did not permit manuever so the conflict become a war of attrition. Another poster also mentioned the Italian campaign. Command and Control: It seems to surprise some but the ability to control large armies (one hundred thousand plus) simply didn't exist before the end of the First World War. Even with the space to maneuver, the Americans found in the Civil War that it was not easy to achieve a breakthrough when faced with significant defenses (see the Seven Days Battles). In fact the Americans never really were able to develop sufficient ability to command large bodies of troops nor manage their logistics during that conflict, rather it being won through the far superior industrial capacity of the North rather than the evolution of the operational art. We see similar results in the excessive casualties suffered by both sides. Another example of command and control hindering the offensive movement of an army occurred at the First Battle of Gaza. The Australian Light Horse were able to enter the city at the end of the day, but were withdrawn due to concerns regarding Turkish reinforcements and poor communications. In fact communications played a very large role in poor C&C in WW1. 

It's hyperbole. By what rubric are we measuring greatest? Let's make no mistake, ALexander achieved some amazing victories - but were they the astoundingest ? Did he overcome the greatest tactical or strategic disadvantages? Where's the measurements? Territory conquered? At any rate, the one to me that was always the most portentous, (and some might dispute this rather oblique, sleep deprived, wine fueled answer.) The Gordian Knot. 

So we can infer that the possibility that the Russians were using a cipher as devastatingly primitive as a Caesar shift is quite high - but that it is also just as likely that in reality, communications were intercepted in the clear. The cause seems to be likely down to poor operational security from the Russians. It seems also likely that the Soviets did possess comparatively sophisticated ciphers for the day; but that they didn't use them as a result of poor signals discipline. It would also appear that an Ian Johnson has done some work on this exact subject in a paper titled "No Divine Intervention: A Reexamination of the Battle of Warsaw, 1920" which I was unfortunately unable to source at this time. In conclusion not only does it seem likely this tale is accurate, it probably does not even represent the extent to which the Poles had compromised Russian signals. There seems to have been quite a bit of research done on this particular penetration of Russian communications networks during this time. $URL$ $URL$
