A rim worn down from age through braking may shudder. In my experience the rim shuddered more when the tyre was more highly inflated. This can be tested by clamping the brakes on the bicycle, and turning the wheel to detect uneven deformation when the brakes grip excessively at particular points. The deformation in this case will not be immediately obvious to touch or sight. After testing with the brakes, the deformation should appear as a spreading of the rim at the most worn section. In this circumstance the rim will need to be replaced, involving rebuilding the wheel. 

I've switched to a CF seatpost since then, same problem occured, but hair spray come to rescue again. No slipping for months. 

"XOR" stands for nothing, it's a typo in "XCR". Here's a review of this bike where you can read the model clearly on photos and the XCR aggregate page on Suntour's website. 

The frame seems suspicious: it clearly was TIG-welded, just look at those smooth tube joints and compare to 80s lugged frames, which means the MY should be at least in mid 90s. The Dyna looks very similar, but the the dropouts don't match (holes vs no holes). Newer frames either have seatpost bolt inline with top tube or a modern collar, but the frame in question has the bolt at least a centimeter higher than the top of the top tube. The paint doesn't match the time period either, the most similar paint jobs date to 80s lugged frames, just like the head badge. I think it was repainted with the use of an aftermarket decals set. I'd look for any branding cues in every crook and nanny and ask the previous owner about the model and paint job. 

There's yet another reason to replace tyres, not covered above: When the bead snaps and pierces the sidewall. An unusual failure mode for a Schwalbe Marathon Plus. 

It turns out the core issue was frame deformation from a 2 km / h collision with a car near the bottom bracket bending the rear triangle out of true and this changing the chain line. Unexpected. 

I own a Serfas USL-5 raider usb headlight. This failed after very heavy rain, the blue charge light lights, but the switch won't produce light? What should I do. 

Yes, you can, but a 2mm spacer might be need. 10 speed Shimano MTB cassettes require same freehub body width as 11 speed. Meanwhile, Shimano road-specific cassettes are ~2mm wider. To be sure, I'd measure freehub body width (36.75 on that pic). If it's about 37mm, that means rear hub can accomodate wider 11 speed road cassettes and you will need a spacer for sure. Otherwise, you can put a 10 speed cassette as is. On a side note, Novatec (Joytech) produces a wide variety of hubs, same models can have both XD, 10 and 11 freehub body options. 

Don't attempt user service. The rubber front-piece doesn't give access to the body, the case body is tightly shut, and there is no way in through the power button. All you'll do is ruin the pre-existing water resistance by damaging the seal on the rubber front-piece. Do leave the light indoors in a dry area and allow natural movement of moisture to clear the light. In some cases this will allow the light to return to normal functioning after 2-3 days or more. If you have removed the rubber front-piece, carefully and gently use a flat nose screwdriver or plastic probe to lift the plastic body of the light and try to use finger pressure to cram the rubber gasket back into place. It will be held by plastic alligator style jaws that come together when the body of the light reseals. Just be gentle and keep at it and you'll get most if not all of the way there eventually. 

You can't use Hope Tech 3 V4 calipers with Shimano levers because Hope brakes generally use DOT fluid, which is incompatible with Shimano's mineral oil fluid. Technically, you can connect them, but the seals might/will fail. However, there is a Hope RX-4 SH post mount caliper which is specifically marketed as compatible with Shimano drop bar levers and uses mineral oil. It's similar to Tech 3 V4 and even uses the same pad, I see no reason why it wouldn't work just as well for MTB applications as for road/gravel/CX. 

I had this happen one time on a stint down the coast. Six flats. All rim-side. Lovely. I've already seen some good solutions above, but I'll throw in my two-cents just for clarity's sake. First, it's probably not the patch but the tube getting re-punctured/stressed in the same place - the patch just happens to be there, so I would (as someone above suggested) switch out rim-tape (that being said, try using a new tire just to take that variable out of play). Also, run your finger inside the rim to see if there are any sharp pieces sticking out either on the side or from the spoke hole. You may need to use a file to smooth them out or remove them. You didn't describe the puncture, and it may have been caused by the spoke-hole, or it could have been something else. It's worth taking a closer look - if it's a length-wise cut, rather than a puncture, the rims are biting into the tire, and the rim-strip should fix the problem - as long as it's wide enough. Also, when you see the rim tape sliding around, you have to ask 'why?'. You may have been riding on underinflated tires, or had a small collision with a curb which created the stress that caused the flat. 

I am now a food delivery boy. I currently check brake and tyre pressure daily by riding. I wipe my chain and brake surfaces weekly. My weekly run is 400 km and 66 hours on road. As a non mechanic what cleaning or user service schedule should I follow for safety and component longevity. I have already decided on 4 lbs services a year. 

Very large old-fashioned saddlebags might be a go. They exist. Brooks stock ones up to 10L in canvas. Revelate has a more modern underseat "holster" that can take a 14L drybag. Carradice make up to 24L traditional saddlebags in "100%" waterproofed duck. 

Ultegra switched to 10 speed with 6600 model. Judging by Google, Shimano unveiled the groupset in 2004 and it became available in October 2004. 

This part is officially called "cable hook" and "cable hook unit" in Shimano docs. See attached image (I won't link it because the PDF is not hosted by Shimano) and this document (page 7). 

If you want to put 2.2" tires in place of current 2.25" tires, then yes, you can do that. That's less than a 2mm difference, given that tires conform to marketed width at all (which they tend not to). Generally, any smaller tire size (of compatible beat seat diameter) won't cause any issues, unless there's a huge mismatch between rim and tire width (i.e. 40mm internal width rims and 25mm wide tires aren't a good idea, same goes for 10cm fat tires and 18mm rims, but that's not your case). I advise to consult this page on a topic of tires sizing. 

I replaced a worn chain the day after the chain indicator check showed 100% wear. I replaced the 8 speed 52 full link chain with 52 + a half link plus a quick connector. The quick connector is fully seated. Chain skip is happening on all gears under load. The bike is a loaded work bike and did not have skip on the old chain. The old chain was last checked at 2200 or 2400 km. Why am I experiencing chain skip? 

Looks like you have a set of Hayes HFX Max G1, you can use these pads. Surprisingly, a lot of other people experience the same issue as you. 

Obviously, an 11-speed cassette is required. For a road bike: you should check if your freehub body has a spacer, if it does then the hub can accept any Shimano/SRAM 11 speed cassette. If there's no spacer, you can get a Shimano CS-HG800 (works with narrow freehub bodies). If freehub is Campy-spec, then any Campy 11-speed cassette will fit. Another option is to source a wider, aftermarket freehub body if such an option is available. For MTB: get any 11-speed cassette compatible with your freehub (which is most likely a regular Shimano HG). You will need 11-speed shifter(s), compatible with your new RD. A cheaper solution might be to get a friction shifter or only a rear shifter and leave the old front shifter as is. You did not say what RD you already have, but I hope it's a not an MTB-specific one, otherwise you'd have "fun" looking for a compatible shifter option (there are some). Any 11 speed chain. Make sure your new RD can clear the biggest cog on the new cassette. Usually, this info can be found in product manual. Make sure the RD can handle the chain growth capacity. I'm not sure road 11 speed system work with a triple up front, you did not specify what the current groupset is.
