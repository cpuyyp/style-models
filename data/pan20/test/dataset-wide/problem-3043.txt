Perhaps we need more hard information in order to give correct support to a serious explanation of the facts. In the present state of our knowledge, I am afraid we simply cannot give a definite answer to the question. [2] Compare with the 1783/84 Laki event, that affected mostly the British Isles and parts of the North of France - but not Southern Europe or the Balkans. This is typical of wind patterns over the North Atlantic. 

Was the supernova detected in Europe, but not reported? If so, detected by whom? Why was is not reported? Or if reported, why has the information not been conserved until now? Was the supernova not detected in Europe, and if so why not? Was there less interest in celestial phenomena than in the Orient? Or was there less knowledge available to interpret observed phenomena? Why is there no report of observations of the supernova in the Western arab word, either the Magreb or the Andalous? These civilizations were perfectly up to date on scientific advances, and well connected with the rest of the arab-speaking sphere of influence (e.g. Baghdad). 

Basically, what can be seen here is that the 1054 Crab Nebula supernova is at about 20 degrees removed from the sun during daylight hours, when at maximum emission. It must have been difficult to see in this conjunction, as are the planets Mercury and Venus when very close to the Sun. Difficult - but not impossible. Moreover, this difficulty would have been precisely the same, seen either from North-Western Europe or from East Asia. At earlier or later dates, the Sun would have been further apart from the supernova thus lessening glare, but the supernova's own emission levels were much lower. Now, consider where the supernova has been documented from: very clearly in China and Japan, with perhaps one observation from the Middle East. Does this mean it was not observed in Europe? One must think not, even though local conditions could have interfered: increased cloud cover or volcanic emissions. These could have had an influence in some parts of Europe, but not on a sufficient scale to affect the complete continent[2]. Thus, we are confronted by a natural phenomenon that, from a physical standpoint, could very well have been observed from Europe as from Asia, but that has been clearly documented only in the East. To my mind, this is already a significant development, leading us to a series of questions:

Q3- So After 7 hours for the last man in the army to go through the mountain, they actually camped there. How come?! Answer: I believe they were looting camps of the Canaanite rebels. Not camping as such. 

Siege Engines - Catapults (Trebuchets) & the Ox-Bow There were mainly 3 types of siege engines: older human-powered and newer ‘counterweighted’ trebuchets. The difference is in the details, of operations and effectiveness. And the third is an ox-bow which, according to some, was the state-of-art in 13th century siege equipment. This is probably what everyone refers to as superior because it was an improved version of Chinese over-sized crossbows, and therefore unique to the Mongols 

Viet Minh and Ho Chi Minh Do not forget the origin of the Viet Minh, it was anti-imperialist and anti-colonialist, not anti-Viet. In 1976, Saigon (in South Vietnam) changed its name to Ho Chi Minh City. And who was Ho Chi Minh? The founder/creator of Democratic Republic of Vietnam (North Vietnam). Liberation All of Vietnam celebrates Reunification Day (aka as Liberation Day), after they kicked out the US Army from Saigon. The answer to your question(s) should be obvious if you think about these simple but crucial points for a moment without reference to accepted wisdom (whatever that means). In short, the question does not really make any sense from a Viet perspective. 

Using workers' income figures in specific sectors may be difficult, since some sectors relied a lot on slaves (e.g. mining), and others may have used different sources of manpower in different geographic regions (e.g. agriculture: free workers in Italy, slaves in Sicily). So the income aproach may be difficult. Likewise, the expenditure approach may be complex, unless we have access to data on the consumption of goods (through the amount of taxation levied upon goods, perhaps?) This would leave us with the production approach, i.e. determine the amount of goods produced in each geographical region, find market prices for these goods, multiply getting the production value per sector and per region. Just an impression I have: maybe the Roman Empire is actually a good place to try this out, since a relatively small types of goods seem to have occupied a disproportionately large proportion of trade. Transport of olive oil, wine, wheat, metals (and slaves?) would cover a large part of what has been found in shipwrecks. Of course, this should not let us forget smaller production of goods not offered up for trade. Brassica in Campania would have mostly been consumed locally. But it may give a rough idea of the relative importance of productive sectors. What I am wondering about is how to estimate the importance of the terciary sector. May not be easy when doctors, scribes, et al. will often have been slaves bought for the task. HTH 

There are several points to be considered in this question. Let us start by seeing some hard facts. As quoted by Wikipedia article SN1054: "Crab Nebula probably appeared in April or early May, rising to its maximum brightness of between apparent magnitude −7 and −4.5 (brighter than everything in the night sky except the Moon) by July. The supernova was visible to the naked eye for about two years after its first observation. Thanks to the recorded observations of Far Eastern and Middle Eastern astronomers of 1054, Crab Nebula became the first astronomical object recognized as being connected to a supernova explosion." Mayall, Nicholas Ulrich (1939). "The Crab Nebula, a Probable Supernova". Astronomical Society of the Pacific Leaflets 3 (119): 145. The important facts are the months in which each phase of the supernova took place. Supernovas have a characteristic curve (actually, two or more types of curves) which describes how light emission takes place. From a low initial value (April/May in the case of SN 1054), emission increases rapidly to a maximum within about 20-40 days (July 10th), then decreases more slowly over a period of 40-60 days. Now, the position of the supernova in the sky is also relevant. In this case right ascension is 5h34m, declination is 22 degrees. However, in early July (such as now), the sun is very close to this position, at least during daylight hours as seen from Northern Europe. Please consider the following screenshot from the Stellarium software, calculated for Paris on July 13, 2015. 

The printing press (as mentioned in a previous, very good, answere) allowed knowledge to be spread far and fast. People were able to learn from other's mistakes. For example the Aztecs sent their Emperor to meet Cortes and his soldiers because they believed he was unbeatable - any Western European soldier would have known that would result in his capture or death but even the most senior Aztecs did not because the Western Europeans knew from written history that between aggressive enemies who did not respect each other's Gods (even if they themselves could not read, that is how the knowledge was stored) that type of strategy would not work. Updated in response to comment (sorry, I cannot post comments to reply for some reason): The reason it was the European section of Euroasia who benefitted most from the above is a combinations of reasons: 

These are both good answers but I think I can offer some extra points not included in them (after I have +1ed them both)! This is all cloaked in the wool of human history (there is always a counter example somewhere and a lot of this deals only in the general cases): The driver seems to be (as stated previously) the multiple states of almost equal power causing a massive arms race which knocked on to races in pretty much everything else. Each nation was essentially a full time competitor so the incentive to trade, explore, research and develop was huge. Once this is in motion everything procedes at an exponential rate. The climate allowing effective farming to be embraced, which included the following effects: 

India's first (& most reliable) census was from 1867 to 1871, known as 1872 Census of India. Government of India confirms this in their census history So, there is no data prior to this census, hence all numbers below are estimates. In terms of estimated population, circa 1800 to 1850, The Cambridge Economic History of India, Volume 2, c.1751–c.1970 provides estimates on p.466, Table 5.1 (the range is from different authors' estimates): 

Finally, I don't think the Japanese (during WW2) had any real intention of occupying Ceylon or thereabouts (southern India) because it is quite far outside (geographically) from their concept of Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. 

Finally, as Wikipedia entry of this battle states, the date of this battle can be different from the one you've provided (1457 BC). This battle given by Cline is dated 1479 BC. 

Historical Linguistics: West Asia? (additional info and sources) I have read the answer by T.E.D -- which is the only answer that seems worthy of consideration (the others are inchoate). We can learn a bit by what he is saying. In this, I hope to help clarify, not to repudiate, because I am no more qualified to answer this question than TED. And, more often than not, he is correct on history of linguistics of Eurasian cultures. Using Wikipedia, TED makes the point of differentiating cultures in West Asia vs East Asia, . Note that this differentiation is based on a purely linguistic argument. I would say be careful, because:
