I am wondering what is the best way to approach sick leaves when dealing with remote workers / telecommuters. Is there an Additional Stigma? What's the Difference when You're Already Home? I feel like there's an additional stigma for remote workers: there's the fear of suspicion of co-workers that they're slacking if they take a day off even though they already work from the "comfort" of their home office, and the notion that they're already partly on leave anyways. While working from home doesn't mean you're in your pyjamas with a cup of coco working with your laptop on the couch in front of the TV zith kids screaming around and chit-chatting with friends or relatives simultaneously (or at least I hope that's not the general case, but to each their own so long as you manage to work...), the naming itself of the "home office" carries with it the notion that you are already home. So it's not that far-fetched to think you could just sit at your desk and work at a slower pace, especially as "it's right there", you don't have the actual commute, and you don't risk spreading your germs around the "real" office and contaminate your co-workers. Surely, You Can Drag Yourself to your Desk or Stay in Bed and Type, Right? Plus it's not unusual for companies to allow people to work from home if they feel sick. Whether that's a good thing and a form of pressure is a different question, and it comes with known caveats, but as this practice exists, it makes it even harder to consider taking a sick leave for tele-commuters. Of course we're not talking about a prolonged sick leave for a broken limb or a long-lasting condition that would require treatment and really impeach a worker's abilities. So... 

I also am not a lawyer (but I have some interest in the law). I do have 35 years experience in the UK workplace. (I refer to "Alice"â€¡ rather than "Person A" below, as I find it easier to read) Don't worry about it. 

A number of people have mentioned that you (depending on jurisdiction - not in Scotland for example) need consideration to create a contract. However that neglects the possibility that the NDA is not a contract, but is instead creating or documenting a duty of confidence. If it ever came down to them suing you for breach of confidence, then the fact you had signed an NDA would make it clear that you were aware that the info was confidential. I would ignore the request and say nothing. 

I agree with the "you'll be fine" tenor of the other answers here. I want to add one additional suggestion: If you feel that your dress is uncomfortably different from the others and want to change it, one option is go more formal. For example, wear a vest (UK: waistcoat) and bow-tie. For some groups, the point of tee-shirt and jeans is to identify how unconventional they are (compared to "normal business" - the fact that it is very, very, conventional for a small web startup is not the point); wearing ultra-formal clothes is also unconventional and as such, more acceptable than normal business attire. The other point to make is: ask. If this is your first (or early) job, people will be fine about you asking if your clothing is OK. 

Would do. Amend wording where applicable. I'd say that just saying you need it to provide "proof of employment" to some organization is likely to be the least suspicious and usually lets them know you need it rather quickly. 

They've got more motivational pull than a free lunch or an awkward company-sponsored binge-drinling opportunity that not everybody might enjoy to attend. Of course it's hard to please every one, but at least the fact that you try is good enough, and that you don't seem to be cheap about it and to just use a carrot to lead them. Everybody hates it when they slave for weeks and then just get a lousy 2 hour lunch or just a evening party. Sure that cost you money, but it doesn't take away the bitterness. Of course if everything else is already pretty great in your company and nothing is too important or urgent to improve (by your employees's own admission in totally anonymous surveys), then by all means, focus on the parties. Motivation Comes from Conviction First and Foremost But all the above is not what motivates people. Money might, for a while, but only if they like what they do will it keep them at it long enough. Otherwise at some point interest will fade. Same for just a fancy and fun environment. They need to believe - at least a little bit - that what they do matters. For starters, that means it's on you to hire the right persons for the right jobs. And you need to make them feel like what they do is useful, and that they can take pride in it. You don't necessarily need "big goals" or to have them convinced they'll "change the world", like I see in so many soon-to-be-defunct startups' ads. But they need to feel some degree of pride in what they do, if you want that to translate to a certain degree of commitment. 

The only thing that would make it unethical is if you negotiate with "if you don't give me a pay-rise, I will look for another job". That should be treated as a commitment to stay for at least a year (unless there is a significant change in your circumstances - eg a partner moving to another state). However, if you go in with "I think I've done pretty well over the last year, do you agree I am due a rise?", there isn't a problem. 

I used to work nine-hour days regularly (and happily), and then my son was born. Suddenly I had to leave at 5:30 to pick him up from nursery. It turned out that the world did not collapse, nobody at my office objected, and there was no negative impact on my job. The first thing I would try, is just saying "I'm not being productive any longer, I'm off." and leaving the office at a reasonable time. It's important to set expectations. Remember the amount of work you get done, is not linear with the number of hours you spend in the office - in fact, for many creative tasks, if you stay too long you are likely to undo good work you did earlier. If there is push back from your manager when you try to work reasonable hours, I would polish my CV and start looking for a better job. When asked, I would say that I was looking for a better work-life balance, and was working 50 hour weeks by my third week. (You need to get that figure in - just saying that you don't like working long hours will be a red flag to employers. Saying that you don't like working 50 hours weeks won't.)
