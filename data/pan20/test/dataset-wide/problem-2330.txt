The answers to this question may differ based on location, but I can tell you that in my part of the world there is legislation in place for controlling populations of certain birds (as well as other pesky critters). Bird feeders are for bird watchers who want to attract birds into their yards. I'm the other type of people. I have raspberries, saskatoons, cherries, and apples growing in my yard, so I want the birds to stay away. I have bird nets protecting my trees and bushes, owl decoys to scare the birds away (as do many of my neighbours), and a list of all the birds considered "nuisance birds" under Alberta legislation that anyone can legally dispose off using good husbandry. There is no ecological justification for feeding birds, they don't need the food, the vast majority of the birds eating from your feeders aren't threatened species. Odds are many of the birds you're feeding are in the same boat as sparrows, starlings, magpies and rock doves are in Alberta; they're considered nuisance birds, and do damage to the crops meant for people. Providing them with food only increases their numbers, and gives added cause for agriculturalist to cull them in order to control their numbers. If you enjoy having the birds in your yard, that's fine. But you're not helping them. In fact. you're doing the opposite. Some of the birds you so generously feed likely become dependant on the food you provide them to the point where they would struggle if you were to stop. Bird feeders are for bird watchers. They aren't for the birds, they're for the people who fill the feeders and like to watch the birds. There's nothing wrong with feeding the birds, just keep in mind that there are also lots of places where there's nothing wrong with killing them just to reduce their numbers (or teaching them a lesson for ruining all my cherries). 

Big wall climbers always leave their harnesses on, at most they will loosen or unstrap their leg loops while they're in their portaledge. There's really no reason to ever take off your waistbelt, as you can change your pants and shirt with it on (although maybe slightly loosened) and when you toilet you only need to take your leg loops off so you can pull your pants down to poop into a bag with detergent in it and store it in your poop tube/waste case. Climbers will pee over the edge (depending on what the etiquette is for the area), but only girls need to remover their leg loops to accomplish that (unless they're packing a funnel like a GoGirl or Freshette). 

There are even screwgate biners with devices that will prevent crossloading which also work to prevent the screwgate from opening unintentionally: 

Edit: Over 1000 species of rhododendrons/azaleas exist. All parts of the plant are considered poisonous, and as little as ingestion of 0.2% of an individualâ€™s body weight can result in poisoning. When ingested, clinical signs include gastrointestinal signs (e.g., drooling, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, inappetance), cardiovascular (e.g., abnormal heart rate, heart arrhythmias, weakness, hypotension), and central nervous system signs (e.g., depression, tremors, transient blindness, seizures, coma, etc.). The overall prognosis is fair with treatment. When burned the gryanotoxin is destroyed at temperatures of 150 degrees Celsius and above, and no evidence of toxicity has been found in the smoke or coals of the rhododendron plant. It is a hard long-burning wood and can be used safely. However, inhalation of any smoke from any fire can have harmful health effects and should generally be avoided. 

There are such things as reusable energy-absorbers, they use rope and a braking plate to absorb the energy of a fall. Stiched webbing energy-absorbers are only intended to catch one fall, but that fall typically has to exert at least 2.5kN (250kg) on the device before it will start to tear. If the threads in the energy absorber tear, then yes, it needs to be replaced, if you do not replace it, then it will not absorb as much or any shock at all the next time you take a fall and could fail. 

First of all, modern technology has eliminated the necessity of using campfires to stay warm at night with light weight tents and effective sleeping systems. There was a time when fires were almost a necessity in order to sleep comfortably in the cold, but nowadays they are only required in survival situations, and are actually frowned upon by people who practice Leave No Trace ethical camping. But, knowing how to construct an effective fire screen is still valuable knowledge to possess if you ever do find yourself in a survival situation. Reflectors were used to capture more of a fire's heat by reflecting what heat was being radiated away from your bed back into your open sleeping shelter. A more efficient reflector would obviously reflect as much of that radiating heat into your shelter as possible. 

I'm a very static climber, but back in the day I was one of those climbing cave rats who campused and dyno'd his way through as much of a problem as he could. The key to becoming a more static climber, is to learn more technique and balance. I learned how to be a static climber from bouldering. You can learn a lot from reading a book, or watching some videos, but the best way to learn is to have a skilled climber teach you footwork and different handholds, and then practice a lot at your local climbing gym. I learned all my technique from hanging out at the wall and projecting bouldering problems with climbers who were way out of my league. The thing I love most about the climbing community is everyone is always very encouraging and keen to share their knowledge and offer advice. Bouldering is a great way to learn technique and develop strength because you're doing short strenuous climbs that usually revolve around doing one or two very specific moves, as a beginner you almost learn a new move every time you climb a new problem, especially if you're with a group of people all trying to project the same problem, because unlike sport climbing where you're usually by yourself up on the wall, bouldering is a very social sport, with a group of people all hanging out on the ground while one person tries the problem out at a time. A few exercises you can do on your own to learn more balance and climb more static, is first of all, learn how to crimp, and climb more routes that use lots a tiny crimps and slopey sloper holds. Crimps and slopers are terrible to hang onto, as you can easily pop or slide off just by changing your body position, they also require a lot of finger and core strength, which makes them perfect for learning how to static climb, because you're forced to learn balance in order to make any use out of them. Teeny tiny crimps are one of my favorites because you can't just grab at them like a big jug, you have to get your fingertips on them, settle into a good crimp and then lock off your thumb before shifting your weight. Slopers are another favourite for a couple of reasons, first of all they're next to impossible to injure yourself on-they're very tendon friendly (unlike crimps)-secondly, they give you great abs. Slopers are the holds you notice a lot of people screaming in the gym to hang onto them, that's because you have to tense up your core a lot in order to keep them. I used to practice crimps and balance by traversing my local wall (which was textured) without using any holds. It took me a very long time before I had fianlly figured out the beta to get all the way across, and there'd be some parts where I'd be flexing every part of my body just so I could cross my left hand one hand width over my right. Footwork is hugely important when static climbing, one drill you can try to teach yourself better footwork is to consciously move your feet two or three times every time you move a hand once. Footwork is key for good balance. Another way to learn footwork is to climb one-handed. with only one hand on the wall, you naturally are forced to rely a lot more on your feet. Lastly, another fun drill to try in order to make you climb more statically is to climb blindfolded. You aren't going to be dynoing to anything you can't see, and being blind naturally makes you very cautious, so you slow down and spend more time feeling your balance trying to find holds in places that make sense for how your body is balanced vs. trying to jump up and grab that big tempting jug you can see higher on the wall. Static climbing is "smarter" climbing, the more you think your way through a climb, the more static you're going to be. 

Put your clothes, water and soap into the bag (fill 20-40% of the volume of the bag). Get as much of the air out of the bag as you can (saturate your clothes and work out any air that might be trapped in material-getting as much air out as possible really helps you out in the next step) and then roll the top 4-5 times and clip it. Rub your clothes together inside the bag for a couple minutes - for better results you could pack a small silicone washboard, something like an anti-skidding silicone washboard for the shower might even work. Pour out the soapy water and replace with clean rinse water. Rinse (shake the bag). Wring out as much water as you can, if you have a towel you can press your clothes in it to draw out extra moisture, then hang them to dry while you sleep. 

There's zero industry standardization for calculating the volume of a bag, and there are numerous factors that affect the total volume - like home many pockets/compartments are in the bag and, and the overall non-uniform shape of the bag. Most companies just do an approximation by stuffing a bag full, then measuring its length, width, and height and doing a simple calculation for volume (L x W x H = V), and rounding to the nearest Litre/5 Litres (1,000cm3 = 1 Litre). You can quickly measure the approximate volume of your bag by stuffing it with pillows or a sleeping bag, then taking your three measurements with a tape measure. You don't have to be exact, because not a single bag on the market is, which is why you can fit more stuff in some brands of 30L bags than you can into other's. From your picture I'm guessing that's a 20-30L bag. Odds are you'll measure the volume of your bag an it'll come out to some odd measurement like 26.87L, in which case your bag would probably have been marketed as either a 25L bag, or a 30L bag. You can take the time to try and figure out the exact volume of your bag, but what is that really going to benefit you aside from satisfying your curiosity? All that matters is how much stuff you can fit in it. The sizes in Litres are just meant to help you get you into the ballpark of what you're looking for in size when shopping for bags. 

Thimbleberry leaves are my favourite (Rubus spectabilis), They're all over the place in the Kootenays in British Columbia (Southern Canadian Rockies). They're soft and they're about the size of your hand or bigger. The berries are very tasty too, so you you can have a peachy-fuzz-tart-raspberry snack while you do your business. 

16ft (5m) When rock climbing, you're pretty much guranteed to be landing on rock if you fall. When I trained in CSPS and EMP III, the magic number was 16ft (~5m). If someone fell from upright with their feet above that height or higher onto a solid surface, then they were an instant bag and drag, aka: strapped to a spine-board and rushed to the hospital. Unless you land on your feet, and you have the leg strength to soak up the force of the landing or you have the skills to tuck and roll, then you're either going to break bones or suffer internal injuries. You won't die instantly from this height (unless you land on your head or neck) but you will be at risk of dying from shock if you can't get help. So, according to emergency first-aid responders (in Canada), the answer to your question would be; a fall from any height above 16ft or 5m can result in serious injury that could lead to death. 

Off width cracks are cracks that are too big to finger jam or fist jam, but too small for you to fit inside and chimney climb, so you have to come up with really awkward and very physically excerting moves to get up them, like climbing upside down (literally). Basically they are cracks that are just the right width to not be fun, and take a lot of physical exertion to climb. Off width climbing is a lot of grunting, struggling, and trying to wedge your various body parts any where you can. You come out at the top dirty, sweating, scraped up all over and absolutely exhausted. A common technique to get through off widths is to essentially use your arms and legs the way you would use your fingers in finger cracks, shove as much as you can inside the crack and then bend them to get them jammed. Other than that, the answer to how you climb offwidths is, "However you can." 

The simple answer is the weight of your rope. When you're at the top of a pitch, you will have the full weight of 60m of static line below you, braking on your device. As you move down the rope, there is less and less rope below you, ergo less weight and friction on the braking end of your device. To avoid this, as well as any possible rope entanglements from throwing your rope over the side of a cliff, you can rappel with your rope flaked out nicely in a sling clipped to the side of your harness, and let it out as you descend, this eliminates the extra weight on the device: Learn This: Alpine Rope Management 

First thing you want to do is get as much of the skunk goo off of you as you can. Using paper towel, tissues, or a rag you can throw away, dab the spray off your skin. Rinsing with water does not work because the skunk spray is oil based. 

In brief, the better your shelter is planned out, and the more time you dedicate to building it well, the more efficient your reflector is going to be. Your biggest enemy is going to be the wind, if you can't avoid setting up camp in a windy location, then you need to spend more time constructing a shelter which will protect against the wind, in the plains you can easily accomplish this by digging a pit shelter if it's feasible for you to do so and the ground is soft. If you have as many as four people, you could build four lean-tos in a closed square and all sleep around the fire, then the only heat that could escape the would be that which is going straight up. This basically emulates a teepee, which is also an extremely effective shelter for reflecting heat from a fire. Other tips for improving the efficiency of your wind screen would be to use more reflective materials such as tin foil, or a survival blanket, or by building screens in a semi-circle around the back and sides of your fire so no more heat is wasted. Simple geometry can even aid in improving efficiency, by angling your screen/s to more effectively direct the heat where you need it. The simplest way to make your screen more effective, is just to make it bigger. Walk around your shelter and your fire to see where the heat is radiating away from your bed and keep adding onto your reflector, or add more reflectors to direct more heat from your fire back into your shelter.
