Actually, it would require a square of the effort, as pressure is force per unit area. And that's before we consider the resistance of the filter. It's infeasible for any creature to go much past its normal intake pressure due to this. 

Suicide The only way to avoid your punishment is to commit suicide in such a way that the body is utterly destroyed, or impossible to access. Thus, when are you done with your nefarious deeds, you simply bail out on your punishment. This could be achieved by throwing yourself into a volcano (though the Church has a good 15 minutes to retrieve some piece of you), or by being intentionally consumed by a whale. If the Church doesn't have some way to track you, they'll never find the body. Run to the Hills The other option is more likely if the person isn't ready to terminate their own life in exchange for their crimes. They could simply flee society. Once again, assuming the Church doesn't have some infallible way of tracking the convict, then they could escape somewhere remote, and then resurface with a new identity elsewhere in the continent, or just live in the woods forever. This has some interesting implications in that there may be entire societies of subversive groups who were charged (wrongly or rightly) for crimes, and have not paid the price. Tracking On the flip side, if the Church does have some method of infallibly tracking the convict, the only option becomes a hasty and thorough suicide, such as the aforementioned volcano option. 

CIVILIZATION HAS POTENTIAL TO EASILY SPREAD NORTH (or up a mountain chain) All these excellent insulating materials mean that theoretically buildings can be heated more efficiently and civilization can advance more easily in harsher climates, especially if one can afford to melt snow by spreading a lot of salt around. BUT (speaking of architecture) CONCRETE INVENTION WILL BE somewhat HINDERED Just a wild guess but in a context in which salt spreading for melting purposes is invented before concrete, the latter has a few chances to be invented and extensively used since salt is reinforced concrete’s worst enemy: we can afford to use it in modern world just because we spend a lot of money in building maintenance but this is still really an unbelievable architectonic nonsense. CLEANER PEOPLE Salt is very important in the process of manufacturing soap. To make it obscenely simple soap is made up by fat or tallow and alkaline salts. The salts were the expensive part so soap was a thing for riches. But in this salty utopia soap is a cheap byproduct of animal processing, since a vast variety of salts can be found with relatively little effort. MINING SALT WILL SPEED UP INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION Mining salt was one of the most expensive, laborious and dangerous of operations, due to rapid dehydration caused by constant contact with the salt (both in the mine passages and scattered in the air as salt dust), among other problems borne of accidental excessive sodium intake. While salt is now plentiful, until the Industrial Revolution it was difficult to come by, and salt mining was often done by slave or prison labor. This is obviously not true in a society in which salt is found at surface level and is also nearly infinite. There will probably be professional salt miners and refiners and the industry will be extremely well developed. And there are other substances you can come by while mining salt, such as sulfur, natural gases and even petroleum (trapped under salt slabs by the their impermeable nature). All of them are important substances for technological development and their discovery and exploitation will probably come earlier than in real world because of all this salt mining activity. Obviously all this line of reasoning assumes you can access a 3500 mt deep incandescent basin without consequences, which I anyway doubt (see later, An Impossible Utopia). 

Filtering CO with only a semi-permeable membrane is impossible, due to its similar size to O2. Thus, to satisfy all conditions, we need some mechanism that will separate out unwanted chemicals (preferably in a way that doesn't poison the animal), and then allow the required chemicals (oxygen) into a semi-permeable membrane for a final size pass. The setup that would achieve this is a biochemical filter that feeds into our semi-permeable membrane, and finally into the bloodstream. This has some important implications. The creature will probably have no way of dealing with chemicals that do end inside its blood, such as dissolved CO in liquids, and thus there is a variety of liquids (and solids) that would decompose in the body and become toxic. This is the equivalent of injecting ethanol into someone. You're bypassing the liver, which would normally deal with it. Besides this, its breathing liver (if you will), would need to be able to neutralise a variety of harmful chemicals. Due to how absurdly complex biochemistry is, there probably exists some gas that will get through the filter and come out toxic (this is why methanol kills humans but ethanol does not. Neither are very toxic in the first order, however the same chemical pathway that turns ethanol into vinegar, turns methanol into formic acid, which is quite toxic). Thus it's impossible to have a creature that will survive all airborne contaminants. There will exist some situation in which they'll need a gas mask. However you can have a creature that can deal with most commonly found contaminants on the planet upon which they reside, with analogues to those contaminants being toxic. 

EDIT: I saw others pointed out the same criticality and you readily linked a scientific paper which directly addresses the topic. I’m amazed at the complexity of climate. And as naive as it may sound, I really didn’t consider the extensive mountain chains which surround the Mediterranean Sea. If I understood correctly the paper, you can legitimately have cool, even humid (!) climate on land above sea level while still having an arid extreme environment below. That’s amazing. I suppose that this is made possible by the fact that this dry pit of hell was not caused by climate but rather by extreme depth. Fascinating, thanks for making me discover this unbelievable phenomenon. 

EVEN MORE MINING (AND WAR) Did you know Nitrate minerals are often mined for use in the production of lethal explosives? AFTERLIFE WOULD NOT BE THE SAME AGAIN Unlike real world salt would not be considered a “sacred substance” (but I guess that a nearly endless salt desert will be regarded with a certain reverence, same way as sand is not a sacred substance but a desert can be a holy place). I don’t know if this is necessarily true since according to gospels Jesus, who lived in a geographical area plenty of salt, still used salt a metaphor to indicate something very precious (but that can be cultural contamination). Sure thing, sooner or later primitive societies around this sparkling abyss will discover the important mummification properties of salt, and not unlike how ancient Egyptian did with Natron Valley and the substance which goes by the same name, mummification and body preservation in the afterlife could become an important part of their religious consciousness. 

Not necessarily. Logistics The answer to any question of "should we do X" can always be rephrased as "is the benefit of doing X greater than the cost(s) of doing X". So let's rephrase: In a civilisation that has access to tonnes of planets, would vertical farming outweigh the cost of setting up the farms? For certain planets, the answer would be yes. Temperate planets that are close to existing hub worlds for example would have low cost of transport for goods manufactured on them (food included), thus more extreme forms of manufacturing (such as vertical farms) could be utilised before it becomes inefficient to build more dense and/or complex systems. It's not just a matter of the space required, but also the world's climate (and how easily it can be terraformed), as well as how it relates to the economy at large. If it is in a convenient location, or is highly abundant in a particular resource, then it may be worth it to employ advanced engineering techniques to maximise the utility of that planet. 

There are two approaches you could take here. Semi-Permeable Membranes Membranes of this type allow only certain ions or particles via diffusion or passive/active transport. A dialysis machine for example uses this sort of membrane. For ion transport, these require a carrier fluid. Oxygen, Nitrogen and CO2 are all mildly soluble in water, so we could use something water-based as the carrier. In this situation, the membrane is just a sieve with an extremely fine mesh size. Well-controlled, this mesh would only allow your selected compounds through. Sickness or mutation could cause this to malfunction in similar ways to how kidney disease affects humans. Interestingly, this means that compounds with a similar physical size to your usual source will be allowed through. This is similar to why carbon monoxide ends up in our bloodstream. It has a similar size and charge to oxygen, and thus gets through the sieve. To prevent poisoning via these chemicals, a secondary mechanism is present in most complex life forms. Biochemical Filters Our liver is one of these. It uses various enzymes and chemical pathways to process chemicals in our bloodstream, and neutralise toxins. This type of filter is often employed after initial size and charge filtering via the normal input pathway (the lungs in this case). Let me get back to your question. 

THINGS CAN GO REALLY WRONG In a certain sense the civilization depicted up to this point is an unbalanced society in which the access to a “modern” comfort such as mass food preservation is unmatched by other solutions to manage population growth such as medicine and fast travel, although the former can supposedly benefit from the salts mining industry (e.g. soap). Primitive societies will be confronted early with the problem of overpopulation, and the ratio between resources and mouths to feed is very reminiscent of the story of a people who loved to build giant stone heads. Factors like increased interaction between different civilizations, war over resources (with explosives!) and population booms due to better diet and better hygiene will all play a role in a fast changing and complex society. And let's not talk about salt tornadoes ravaging the countryside. However all things considered I think that if certain conditions are met it can find its balance. If only this wasn’t… AN IMPOSSIBLE UTOPIA The amazing advantages which came from having an endless reserve of useful minerals is almost too incredible to be real. I know this is not part of the question, but since you provided a specific setting I think it's fair to point out its glitches. The real problem with this scenario is that the conditions which are to be met to make this unbelievably vast salt flat possible will at the same time make human colonization impossible. Not only the intolerable climate will hinder any colonization attempt, but there will be no fishing industry and no farming; in short, nothing to use the salt for. Sure, all the other important properties will be of some value, but the impossible climate will render salt mining in this area as expensive and dangerous as in real world, essentially canceling out the advantages. 

Yes, of course. Our lungs do this. The type of membrane you want is a semi-permeable membrane. The material used for this would be similar to mammalian veins, as they perform gas exchange in our bodies. 

This boils down to the age old question of "can crime be eliminated"? The short version is no. Over a long enough time scale, some poor sod will break the law, either out of ignorance or malice. As for why someone might break the law considering the penalties are so harsh. It's a cost-benefit question. After all, you can only be punished if you are caught, and also convicted. Thus a good lawyer and/or some crafty planning will let you get away with it. If we assume that the judges are all-knowing, mind-reading gods, and that all judgements are true and fair, then we can still fall back on the person only being convicted if caught, so they could just become a fugitive, after all the punishment doesn't get much worse for each subsequent crime. A person treated like X becomes X, because there is no possible downside to doing so. The way they are treated will not change. This is a flaw in all extreme punishments. Once you cross the line, there's no, or little harm in crossing it more. Thus, in such a system you would have no minor crime, and the occasional murderous rampage. EDIT: Extra information has been provided by the creator, thus some clarification is required. The Church has some way of determining a corpse's crimes This changes a few things. Now it is an invetibality that if caught, a fugitive will be subjected to their torture/punishment (whether they are executed first or not). In this scenario, these people have two major options:
