Cracked, stiff, brittle, or containing small puncture holes: if your older tires fit any of these four aspects, it's time to swap them out. However, I would also ask yourself if you remember what those tires have been through. The tires may still be flexible and appear uncracked but be full of micro-cracks and punctures that you can't see with the naked eye. These small fissures can be disastrous when you're in the middle of a run. Spraying an inflated tire with soap & water can help find a leak, but many soaps will actually damage the rubber, making that technique counter-productive. Unless you're just planning to use the bike for a quick run to the corner store, remember the old adage: "when in doubt, swap it out". If I obtain a "used" bike, or rescue one being tossed, replacing the tires and the tubes are the first things I do. 

I've used both fingerless track mits and full-fingered gloves. I've found the main difference comes from what you intend to do, and how long you want to do it. Comfort: I found the fingerless mitts a lot more comfortable, making them great for longer rides. This would be especially important if you're looking at touring through a residential area, taking the long commute to work, or otherwise staying on roads. Once the temperatures start to drop however, the comfort of the fingerless mitts is defeated by the cold, so it's a good plan to switch up during these conditions. Protection: When just biking around the city, chances are if there's an accident, having your palms protected by the fingerless mitts is enough. With smooth ashpalt beneath you, your fingers aren't going to do much in assist in breaking your fall. When mountain biking however, every bit of extra protection helps. The full-fingered gloves provide enough protection to keep your hands working well after most collisions, flips, slides, and scrapes. They won't do much to prevent a full-on break, but stopping a lot of scrapes and bruises can be a lifesaver, especially if you use those fingers for your living. Sweat: Both gloves do provide some wicking. The long-fingered gloves pull the sweat from the entire hand, whereas the fingerless only grab the palm. This can make a huge difference on exhausting rides as the grips on the bicycle get covered in sweat. Grip: Although both types of gloves provide additional grips via the palm, only the long-fingered gloves provide additional grip in the fingers. This can provide a lot of advantages if you're worried about aging handlebar grips, or are forced to discard the grips after an accident and cycle back to town using only the raw handlebars. Tactile Sensation: Here is where the fingerless gloves shine. Because they're still fully exposed, you can feel everythign with your fingers as per normal. This means you can quickly pull over to check your cell phone, fiddle with your bike computer, or whatever else you may need to do that requires fine motor skills in the middle of your trip. Although I've come to miss my tactile sensation, I've found the full-fingered gloves to be more useful on the whole and have opted to use them for the majority of my cycling trips. 

Here is an example of how it works. The below route is between two points in Palos Verde, CA - a notoriously hilly (fun) area. Min Elevation OFF: 

Min Elevation ON: Here's the route with the same end points and the feature turned on -- a savings of 348 feet of elevation gain, but an extra 2.5 miles of riding. 

I commute on my bike through an industrial area and cross many train tracks. They very in degrees: most are perpendicular to the road, but some have a very low angle. This question is two part: 

Strava has this feature in the route planning tool. In the header, you can see it has toggle switches for popularity (pretty nifty if the area is new to you), min-elevation (what you're looking for), and manual. 

What is the best way to cross tracks. It is commonly known that perpendicular is best, but sometimes that is difficult to do given traffic and road circumstances. Also, should one "hop" to reduce impact on tires, or is their some other better technique? It can feel quite jarring to fly over tracks - is there a risk of damaging a bike? Assuming that some kind of altered riding pattern is preferred, what is the best way to do so without impeding traffic or upsetting drivers. Some of the tracks I cross have no shoulder but they do have anxious cars speeding up to get on the freeway. A dismount would be very unpopular in those settings. 

If you look closely at the zoomed photo on Specialized's site, you can see that the label on the "custom" front derailleur says only "SRAM" and "2x10". The regular ones made by SRAM say "X0" or other model names on them, e.g. here: $URL$ It appears that the style of mount is readily available, but perhaps not the precise model with no labeling that Specialized is using. Maybe that means they're using something "between" the regular SRAM grades, or maybe a different surface finish, or.... But this shouldn't matter if you simply need to buy a replacement. 

Current rim depths tend to be between 20mm and 80mm. You can choose along this spectrum to trade weight for aero, but for general use 30mm or 40mm is probably reasonable. Hand-built wheels are an advantage if done well, because they are less likely to have broken spokes. There are plenty of custom wheel builders out there, plus some mass-market manufacturers who advertise hand-built wheels (obviously they'll automate what they can, but hopefully the important parts are done by hand). For hubs you will find two types: cartridge bearing and cone bearing. The former are adjustment-free and you generally can replace the bearings if needed, whilst the latter require adjustment to get the perfect spin. You'll probably want butted spokes of some kind. I dislike aero spokes (with flattened midsections) because they are painful to work on (you inevitably whack your hand with the spokes when working on the bike, and bladed spokes can actually cut you). A recent trend is toward wider rims, which allow more tire volume and are sensible if you will run 25-28mm tires. It's also easier to install and remove wheels if the tire is not much wider than the rim. In your price range you should be able to find 30mm deep wheels around 1500 grams, give or take. 

I commuted often on this trail for awhile and loved it. Most of the trail is free of vehicle traffic and has bridges going over roads. It's a heavily shaded trail that can provide a nice respite from the sun during the hot summer. Potholes are minimal, though minor cracks from tree roots are not uncommon. Also, there can be quite a bit of debris on the trail after a good wind storm. Not too far out of the city the path has a wooden ramp, in good condition, that last about 50 yards. During the commuting hours, foot traffic exists, but I remember going at a pretty good rate with no issues. There are a couple poorly lit tunnels, so you will want a bike light. 

I was reading this article on the most commonly stolen cars, and having my bike stolen recently, I got to thinking: do certain makes/models/types of bikes get stolen more than others? My bike was a 15 year-old GT Aggressor 2.0 (Mountain bike) and it was stolen out of my back yard. I just have a hard time thinking that someone was seeking out that year/model. It would seem that most bike thefts are crimes of opportunity, opposed to targeted attacks, but I don't see any data to back that up. Also, it seems like for cars, the cars that are stolen the most, just so happen to be the same cars most commonly driven. I assume the same would go for bicycles? Any bike thieves want to chime in? 

Replace your RD-6700-GS derailleur with an XT M771 SGS "9 speed" (also works with 10) rear derailleur. It is important that the new derailleur is NOT labeled "Dyna-Sys" (which won't work). This has a "capacity" of 45 teeth; your front big/small rings are 50/30t (n.b. you also mentioned 52t, not sure which is right). So of the 45 tooth capacity you use 20 in the front, leaving 25 for the rear. That means you can use an 11-36 cassette, which would be a huge improvement (20% gear reduction vs your 30t). Total cost around $120-160 (derailleur, cassette, chain). Replace your crankset. This is problematic because MTB front derailleurs are not compatible with your road shifter. You'd probably need to use a bar-end shifter instead, which is not expensive but might not be to your liking if you use the front shifter a lot. You could use an XT crankset and get down to say 24t instead of your existing 30t. But you'll lose some top-end gears. Total cost around $150-400 (crankset, derailleur, shifter, chain). 

Trek used to make only "WSD" versions of the same model names sold "for men." But things aren't that simple anymore! What's the men's version of the Lexa SLX?
