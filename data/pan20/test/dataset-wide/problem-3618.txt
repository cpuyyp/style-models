There is one and only one way to get "abs". Lose weight. That is to say, reduce body fat. The overwhelming way to lose weight is to cut carbs from your diet. If you want abs, that's all there is to it. And, of lesser importance, basically reducing your calorie intake - eating well. As they say "fat loss happens in the kitchen only". Regarding doing aerobic exercise - for example, say you run for 90 minutes each and every day. That will use a tiny amount of calories, which may help with your diet. (NOTE HOWEVER that aerobic exercise literally makes you hungry ... so it can very much hurt your efforts to slash carbohydrate intake.) Regarding weightlifting, it has essentially no connection, whatsoever, to eliminating body fat. I'd just forget it for a couple of years until your abs look great, ie, you have a low body fat percentage. Getting "abs" is simply about slashing your body fat percentage. You do that overwhelmingly by slashing carb intake from your diet. "Fat loss happens in the kitchen only" In the first instance, it goes without saying you have to absolutely totally eliminate bread, pasta, rice and potatoes from your diet - simply, never again in your life allow these to pass your lips. (It's totally self-evident that you cannot, of course, ever eat candy, chocolate, cake, sodas, fruit etc. - zero sweets.) Aim for 70-100 grams of carbs a day in the first instance. You'll see incredible abs in as little as a year or two.

Sean, it's important to keep exercising, add muscle building to your routine, etc., but is there a specific answer to your question? Why there? As Berin mentions, "you" can't target where your body loses fat from. Indeed, "you" can't control your heart beat, for example. But ... something in your body controls your heart beat. And, something in your body controls where the fat is going on or off. What is that "something"? It is your hormones, and I'm going to guess specifically your sex hormones. As an engineer you'll be pleased to know the problem is rational, solvable, and you can do something about it, but first you'll need to gather a lot of information and have a lot of theory on your side before you have practice on your side. in short, it seems that the trio of your 

It is absolutely impossible to eliminate body fat in "only one place". Lifting weights has no connection to eliminating body fat. Lifting weights makes your muscles larger (which is totally fantastic) but has no connection to eliminating body fat. The only way to eliminate body fat is via diet. Body fat is simply caused by eating carbohydrates, which triggers your pancreas to cause glycerides (always present in your bloodstream) to pass in to fat cells in your body (becoming triglycerides). It's just that simple. 

Amazing you can run a lot on just fruits and veg! Regarding that particularly sort of odd tingly problem you describe. I've got a feeling it might be a problem relating to hypoglycemia - a difficult and sometimes misunderstood condition. It can lead to issues like migraines if (in short) you have problems with the dynamics of your bloody sugar levels. I encourage you to buy this book: by Dr Wolfgang Lutz and turn to page 42 for details. Notice the graphs on page 43 - that seemingly tiny difference is a huge difference in your body operations. Since I guess you've lived on just sugar for a few years (most fruit and veg is just sugar), your body chemistry, anything could be happening. If you turn back to the comparative graph on page 39 you will see exactly why fat people get fat, if their insulin response is stuffed-up. Anyway the section on hypoglycemia (and indeed the whole book) may answer the questions you have. Alternately if you speak german consider that "point-diet" book that is popular in austria, etc. at the moment. In short you will (IMO) have to carefully manage your protein and fat balance (and also any carbs you eat) perhaps for some time (a year?) until your body chemistry - basically the "decay time" of that insulin function - returns to some sort of normality. I bet that the problem you describe is some variety of hypoglycemia-like problem caused by your bloody sugar levels going crazy in one direction or the other. As Berin explains, you should really carefully choose "slow" carbohydrates (G.I.) if you must eat carbohydrates. 

To eliminate body fat just slash carbohydrate intake. You might say "OK, I'll eat zero carbohydrates" but that simply won't work (it's simply impossible to have that much willpower). You have to eat the "Goldilocks" amount of carbohydrates (about 70 grams a day) ..... not too little, not too much. 

That is from this book which you should also check out. Once again, something in your body controls where the fat is going on and off. What is that something? Your hormonal balance. My guess, your sex hormones. Your sex hormones, growth hormones, and insulin, must stay together, so if one is too high (whether generally throughout the day, or, perhaps at critical moments during the process of eating and digestion) the other is too low. As you are an engineer, I also particularly recommend chapter 5 of Life Without Bread which will explain exactly in detail the energy processes in your body, both anaerobic and aerobic. I also strongly recommend Practical Programming for Strength Training by Rippetoe & Kilgore which is a fantastic book. (Which Berin pointed out on this forum, it is a great book thanks Berin!) And I recommend "Chemicals for Life and Living" by Eiichiro Ochiai. Those four books are a great start. But definitely Life Without Bread by Lutz for a great exposition of catabolic and anabolic hormones in your body - how your body works and "makes decisions"! Otherwise you're just plugging in resistors and capacitors with no idea what those do. I hope it helps! PS for future readers, regarding Sean's excellent idea (below) to get actual lab work done. Beginning page 57 of Life Without Bread, Lutz, an explanation in great detail of exactly the three clinical tests, which are available, which investigate your sugar response curve. To repeat myself, Schole/Sallmann/Harish of "metabolism" - in other words, the ongoing balance and/or war between catabolic and anabolic processes in your body. once again, chapter 3 of Lutz is the best explanation I have found of the topic (having read about 10 related books).
