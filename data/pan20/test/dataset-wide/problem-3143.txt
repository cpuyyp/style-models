The term "standard model" was faddish in several different scientific contexts in the 1960s and 1970s, however, I think the reason it became adopted permanently in physics was the influence of the use of the term in astronomy. In astronomy the model of the evolution of the universe which today we know as the "Big Bang Theory", was frequently referred to as the "standard model" because there were many different theories of the universe, but the Big Bang theory was by far the most popular, so it became known as the standard model. For example, you can read about this usage in the lecture "Relativistic cosmology" by Ellis, Cargese Lectures in Physics, 1973. So, that was 1973. Right about this time the same term started to get applied to then-current Weinberg-Salam theory of quantum particle physics. The earliest reference to this in a paper I could find was, "Weak nonleptonic decays of charmed hadrons in models with right-handed currents" by G Branco, RN Mohapatra, T Hagiwara, DP Sidhu. Physical Review D, 1976. In this paper it says, 

There are no cases I know of where some fact in his histories has been shown to be false by other reliable evidence. There are many instances where his facts have been corroborated by other evidence. His claims, as far as I have read, are self-consistent. There are, to my knowledge, no significant complaints among Roman writers about the accuracy of his writings. Since Caesar became imperator everything that he wrote was heavily scrutinized by critics of different types in Greece and Italy. These writers would have access to competing accounts of Caesar's compaigns and it is very possible that had Caesar falsified information it would have come out, yet it is hard to find any instance of this happening. 

It took about two weeks. By 1890 postal unions had been formed allowing mail to transit around the world to most places. The domestic rate in the US was 2¢ per ounce. For a first class letter weighing 1/2 ounce or less to Britain the union cost would be an additional 5¢. Thus, the total cost was 7¢ for a first class letter. Here are the rates from 1890, excerpted to show Great Britain: 

Basic flame weapons are effective against flammable targets or in very close quarters. Normally they are not used in any situation where the defenders would have a clear view of the attackers. Flame weapons are currently popular among insurgent fighters due to their simple operation and effectiveness in ambush situations. In World War II, flame throwers were used to clear out no-surrender fortified positions which were primarily found in the Pacific theater of war. Normally when a line or position is overrun the defenders will retreat or surrender. This was not the case for Japanese forces which would often hole up in pillboxes or bunkers and fight to the end. Against such positions a flame thrower is effective if the attacker can approach it from the side or the rear and incinerate it. When the defensive line is intact this is not usually possible, so flame throwers were primarily used in "mop up" operations to destroy fortifications that had already been strategically nullified. In modern warfare, flame throwers are considered to be largely superseded by thermobaric weapons or incendiary rockets which are more powerful and work at longer ranges. Thermobaric weapons are useful in urban or other close quarters in which it is either (1) difficult to target projectile weapons, or (2) the situation is so close, that the use of projectile weapons could harm friendly forces accidentally. 

Whitefield, Bangalore, was older but smaller than McCluskieganj. Legend has it Winstorn Churchill courted the daughter of a hotel keeper there. Vide $URL$ 

The major 'families' are generally equated with language families- so it was theorized that there was Proto Indo European Religion which differentiated into Indo-Iranian, Greek, Celtic and so on. Similarly a Semitic, Ural Altaic, Munda etc family of Religions was believed to exist. More recently Michael Witzel of Harvard University has published a 'family' type theory of Myths. He thinks myths are very ancient and represent the 'ancestors' of the 'religious families' you refer to. Essentially he makes a sharp distinction between Gondwanan (with a Sub Saharan origin) and Laurentian (Eurasian) families of myths. 

Democracy evolved out of the notion that if the people who pay the taxes decide how that money should be spent, then- provided people are rational- tax money will be spent on 'public goods' which enable 'endogenous growth' which involves decentralised innovation and enterprise. Thus the Democracy becomes richer and stronger than its autocratic rivals. Britain became the greatest Imperial power the world has ever seen because, in the Seventeenth Century, it decided to keep the Navy under the control of the tax-payer not the King. Thus the profits from its burgeoning naval might remained in private hands and though there was a lot of corruption, in an emergency, or when an opportunity arose, tax payers would agree- through their elected representatives in Parliament- to pay more in the short run so as to be a lot richer in the long run. India did have 'tribal republics' (janapadas) which had some 'democratic features', however Indian Empires could not be based on a particular tribal identity because of the vastness of the land. It also did have a 'Guild' (Shreni) system whereby merchants and artisans had some countervailing power over monarchs. The same was true of 'caste' brotherhoods (biradaris) more especially those of dominant cultivator castes. Speaking generally, most of India was a segmentary society at the micro-level- i.e. relatively autonomous but highly differentiated- with an overarching, surplus extracting, Imperial administration whose strength fluctuated with economic conditions. India did have some promising 'Prussias'- i.e. tribal/caste based warlike monarchies which might have united the country- but they weren't developing naval power and thus could never really compete with a global naval power. Even China started to succumb because it ignored the navy. Strangely, India continues to neglect its ports and merchant marine which is why, unlike Japan, South Korea and now China, it will remain poor. The Brits could dominate India because the made the profit of exports and imports and also could move troops around by sea. Later they built railways and paid off or crushed internal opposition. Still- like other Empires in India's past- British power was bound to crumble because sooner or later the people wouldn't be able to pay enough tax to finance the Imperial canopy. Thus some far-sighted British administrators wanted to bring representative local government to India so that small towns could gain 'endogenous growth' by taxing themselves for public good provision. In other words, the British saw that some limited democracy at the local level was necessary to prevent the same thing happening to their Empire in India as had happened to the Mughals or to the Portuguese. The Indians did not want to pay taxes in return for having elected representatives who would set a budget. They also did not want to be ruled by anybody. Why? They were suspicious of both 'leaders' and officials. The genius of Mahatma Gandhi was that he promised the Indians an anarchic utopia where there would be no taxes and no officials. Thus, in theory, people could vote for the Congress party without having to pay taxes. However, this also meant that India failed to develop after Independence. In the short run 'begging bowl' diplomacy could give the illusion of progress but longer term it became apparent that the poor can only lift themselves up if they pay a little in tax and elect smart people to decide how to spend it best. 

It is because Corregidor is dominated by Alas-Asin at the end of the Bataan. Anyone controlling Alas-Asin can easily shell all of Corregidor. Originally the US fortress on Corregidor (Fort Mills) had only surface fortifications, but the Army realized that the fort was completely vulnerable to a shore bombardment. Therefore, to make the fort a "self-sufficient" bastion, the tunnels were dug, potentially allowing the US forces on the island to resist a siege, at least temporarily. These preparations later proved to be very useful, because the island was able to hold out against the Japanese for four months during World War II. 

Acne has aways been around historically. The skin of the face, as opposed to the body, is smoother, softer, more oily and grows faster, hence it is more vulnerable to any kind of imbalance. The reason why certain populations have less or more acne depends on their breeding. Since acne is a strong, negative mating selector, as long as a population breeds within itself, people with poorly balanced skin tend to get weeded out over time. Mating outside the group can cause changes to the skin leading to it being imbalanced and not having the proper defenses against acne-related infection. Therefore, among close-knit ethnic groups with no outside mating you may often find no instances of acne, but among cosmopolitan populations like big international cities, you will find a lot of acne. 

It was more of a nuisance, than a reason for defeat. The part of a track that is hard to build is the bed. To narrow a track, all you have to do is pull out the spikes, move the rail and drive the spikes back in again. The bigger problem for the Germans was that the rail system in Russia is a hub-and-spokes design where all roads lead to Rome, meaning Moscow. The Germans didn't need rail lines going to Moscow. They needed rail lines going to Berlin. In other words, the big problem was not the gauge of the railroads, it was their direction. 

No, there was no way to tell. If a confrontation occurred, there were laws that dictated how the parties involved were supposed to announce themselves to each other. Note that in the period in question the old samurai system was starting to break down. 

I will answer this in two parts, concerning historical tradition and actual historical documents. Historical Tradition and Writings None of the stories from the Hebrew Book of Names, which you know as the "Exodus" are found either in Egyptian sources or in later Greek sources describing Egyptian mythology with the exception of the account of Manetho. The account of Manetho, a 3rd century BC Greek writer, is called the Aegyptica and is purported to be based on old Egyptian history. In addition to Manetho's book we have a response attributed to "Flavius Josephus" which is a critique of Manetho's book. In the critique, the author seems to acknowledge the basic facts of the account as being true while denying various minor aspects. Manetho's account of the Hebrews is a long discursion from his main topic which is on the kings (pharaohs) of Egypt. We do not have the full original text of the Aegyptica, but only later epitomes, such as those by Syncellus. The account in the "Josephus" work, Contra Apionem is most detailed, so I will paraphrase it here: 

Muhammad Ali Jinnah was the founder of Pakistan. He started of as a strong Indian Nationalist. However he was disturbed by the comparative backwardness of Muslims in Big Business. Jinnah, like the Turkish economist Timur Kuran, identified the cause of as Islam's Inheritance Law. His own community was exempt from it and had done well. If reforming the Religious Law was impossible, then an alternative was the creation of a Muslim state where non-Muslims would have a lower status. The 'poet-prophet' of Pakistan, Iqbal- also a Nationalist originally- came to believe that Hinduism was based on the Caste system and thus Hindus could never embrace Socialism. Thus he thought separation from the Hindus would be beneficial for ordinary Muslims. Liaqat Ali Khan, who represented the younger generation of Muslim 'barristocrats', had a different perspective. By the time he returned to India, it was clear that Indian politicians, not British Civil Servants, would have their hands on the levers of power and patronage. However, so long as elections were held periodically, people like himself would not enjoy the sort of feudal power they had traditionally possessed. Liaqat saw that if the Muslim League created Pakistan by saying 'Islam is in danger' then it could keep a monopoly of power by simply repeating the slogan. He himself, once in power, showed no eagerness to hold elections and only lost his throne because he was assassinated. The case of Zafarullah Khan is more tragic. He was an Ahmadiyya and viewed the struggle for Pakistan as part of the founder of his sect's mission to restore Islam to its early glory. By the time he died, his sect had been classed as non-Muslim. One final point- non-Muslim minorities in Muslim majority areas quickly understood that their lives and property were not safe. Thus, there would have been an exchange of population even if some sort of Federal solution had been put into effect. 

After Independence, the Indian National Congress was confident of winning a General Election because of its superb grass-roots network and system of patronage. Moreover, Nehru understood that it was his enemies on the Right who had most to lose from free and fair elections while his friends on the Left, outside the Congress, stood most to benefit. Convincing election victories- in which the main opposition was visibly Leftist- gave the Indian regime great legitimacy. There could be no question of an Army coup because the Sandhurst trained General Staff had less influence over the NCOs than their 'gram sarpanch' (village headman) who was probably already part of the Congress machine. In Pakistan, the situation was very different. Jinnah and Liaqat's Muslim League had successfully played the 'Islam in danger' card but there was no way they could carry East Bengal- which had the majority of voters and whose politicians were far more like their counterparts across the border. Even within West Pakistan, immigrant politicians like Liaqat were at a disadvantage. The Muslim landed gentry preferred to deal with Aristocratic Premiers, like Tiwana, as opposed to verbose middle class lawyers . On the other hand, the military- because their officers were rewarded with generous land grants (something which didn't happen in India)- had to work with the 'feudal' land-lords and accommodate their interests. In any case, after the assassination of Liaqat, the Muslim League had no West Wing leaders of stature who were not disqualified by reason of Religious affiliation. In the event, a former soldier turned Political Service officer rose to the top but his unpopularity was such that the ambitious Army Chief had no difficulty packing him off to exile. What alternative was there to the Army? The politicians wouldn't hold elections and thus secure legitimacy because they would lose. The Civil Service had no link to the grass-roots. By contrast, the Army had a network which reached down to the villages. Thus General Ayub Khan saw it as sponsoring something called 'Basic Democracy'. However, elections were still represented a source of danger. Fatima Jinnah, the elderly sister of the founder of the country, did surprisingly well by falsely claiming that Ayub had sold out to the Indians on the Indus water issue. Democracy wasn't good for Pakistan. It split the country and then enthroned a paranoid dictator. The Army had to step in to hang him by the neck simply to save their own skins. In contrast to India, the Pakistani political class had not developed esprit de corps by sharing jail cells nor had they established a personal reputation for self-sacrifice. By contrast, the Pakistani soldier- however much he might enrich himself- needed to have shown courage in battle simply so as to be accepted by his peers. Thus, disillusionment with elected politicians, who enrich themselves unconscionably, always leaves a window open, in Pakistan, for military intervention because there literally is no alternative. 

The one on the left is a detail from the Gunstrup cauldron (4th century), and the other is a depiction of a berzerker from the 7th century. Also, this quote from Diodorus Siculus: 

There were actually two brothers, Tiberius and Gaius Gracchus, known as the "Gracchi". They were demagogues who promoted the interests of plebians and socii in Rome. Their movement signalled the downfall of the Roman Republic. When they could not overthrow the privileges of the long-born Romans (known as Optimates), they started efforts to overthrow the republic by force. These efforts ended in disaster and the traditional forces in the city had them and their followers murdered. This set a bad precedent in which the fate of Rome would be decided by violence and power, not by the votes of the original citizens, the Optimates. The Gracchi were followed by Gaius Marius, who was a novus homo. He saw the power the disenfranchised could give him. Marius, repeatedly elected Consul, did everything he could to become a dictator and essentially restore Rome to a kingship--something it had foresworn centuries ago when the republic was founded. When the champion of the republic, Sulla, left to fight Mithridates, who led a rebellion of the Greeks against Roman rule, Marius took advantage of the opportunity to dissolve the senate, and make himself dictator by force and started executing republicans. At this, Sulla returned to Rome with his legions, instituting a civil war. Marius responded by offering freedom to any slave would fight with him against Sulla. Originally, only full citizens who owned land were allowed to be in the army. For Marius to arm slaves was a complete abandonment of the principles of the republic and an attempt at despotism. Sulla entered Rome with his legions--an illegal act--and eventually defeated Marius the Younger (who committed suicide) and killed thousands of his supporters (the elder Marius had died earlier). All of the slave-soldiers and other usurpers were hunted down and put to death. Then Sulla restored the laws and institutions of the republic and retired. This peace only lasted a short time. Julius Caesar, a follower of Marius with family ties to the Marians, followed the exact path that Marius had--gathering power from the plebs and non-citizens until he had enough power to make himself dictator. This was the beginning of the empire and the final end of the Roman republic. (There is a story that Caesar was originally on the lists to be executed, even though he was a young man. Powerful and connected women in the city interceded to protect Caesar and Sulla's men came to him and insisted Caesar be taken off the lists. Sulla warned them, "In this young man, there are many Mariuses." Nevertheless, Caesar was taken off the lists.)
