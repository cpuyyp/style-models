Use Competitive Cyclist's recommendations Visit LBS and borrow/rent use an adjustable stem to determine correct angle and length based on trial and error. Or lastly, I would refer to personal comfort in terms of how much stress/stretch you desire for your back - the old rule of thumb is while mounted on bike you want the intersection of the handlebar/stem mounting point to obscure the view of your front hub. 

Whatever path you decide, my recommendation is to take and record the following measurements, the two main #'s I use as I move from bike to bike: 1. Top of saddle to center of bottom bracket 2. Tip of saddle to handlebar Hope this helps! Any questions lmk! 

Hope this helps! Added information more specific to your question: Standing vs. Sitting - when standing your legs are now carrying your body's full weight compared to sitting when the brunt of your body weight is being supported by your saddle. Standing requires more energy, but also allows for greater power output. Notice how when standing you breathing increases dramatically. So what does this mean? Typically if the climb is a short, sharp spike then standing may be required and fatigue is less likely occur. If the climb is very long, it is probably wise to stay seated until you are about at the crest or the end of the climb is in sight. In terms of gearing, try to not let your climbing cadence drop below 75 rpm. Once cadence is in the 60 rpm range you are shifting from aerobic to anaerobic exercise and muscle fatigue will set in much faster. On flats, your cadence should be in the 85-95 range. 

I concur with M. Werner & previously used this answer (someone down voted :-O) for similar question: IMO single most important factor of cycling joy is FIT! This is a great tool and worth the effort: $URL$ I have used it myself and referred countless folks to it, all with great success! Good luck! Added for this post: Once you take the measurements and input the data into the fit calculator, you can email yourself the results. Over the years I have been able to move from bike to bike focusing on two measurements which were initially provided by the fit calculator: 1. Saddle Height 2. Cock pit length which is the tip of the saddle to the handlebar. Also, I have been professionally fitted and came out with identical set up as I did when I did the recommended fit calculator. Order of adjustments based on the methods described by M. Werner: 1. Set saddle height 2. Set fore-and-aft of saddle (I use a level here and strongly recommend using one) Once saddle position is set move to handlebars/stem, 3 options here: 

I have ridden ceramic BB bearings. This is my one and only experience. They seemed to take a couple rides to break-in which definitely seemed odd. One of my training partners noticed the same thing, but in his case, it was after 90 minutes that the bearings seemed to spin freely. I rode them for just shy of a year, which is approximately the same usage I get out of standard bearings. Based on the insane price and insignificant difference, I opted to go back to stainless. The riding partner, I mentioned earlier, is on his second set after going back to stainless. If funds permit, I am open to trying again. It was not a bad experience in anyway. Another buddy has swapped all bearings including derailleur pulley bearings and swears by it!! That's all I got! 

Andrew, without knowing how much time you have to train before the trek, I cannot provide an answer to that portion of the question. Time between trek and ride is 4 days...much of this has to be based on how stiff, sore or banged up you feel, but this is an idea of what I would do. Day 1 - Lots of rest, hot bath, and massage. Ride bike on lightest gear for 20-45 minutes. Lightly stretch - focus on core and lower body. Eat only natural, organic, healthy foods and lots of liquids. Day 2 - Same as above but increase spin time to 30-60 minutes. Day 3 - Same as above, but do an hour on the bike and if your body can handle it, stand out of the saddle and use the gears to add resistance, nothing crazy, but you want to push some blood into your muscles...if you are still way too sore - just spin lightly as described above, but increase spin time to 60-75 minutes. Day 4 - If you were not able to add resistance on Day 3 do so now. If you were able to do resistance on Day 3, then spin 60-90 minutes extremely light. My experience is an active yet gentle recovery works best. Your legs are going to want to stiffen up, so the main goal is to keep them warm and loose! If no one will give you a massage, I suggest buying a massager. This is the one I use and it is awesome! $URL$ Good luck! 

I agree with both answers thus far, but fact is to meet your nutritional needs for any ride close to this distance you need to start preparing three days out! Experience is the best teacher and it is always better to have too much food/drink than not enough. I am huge fan of PB&J's on pumpernickel bagels! 

An answer I had posted previously: I ride both SS/FG and approach climbing hills much of the same way I would if I were on a geared bike with one very big exception...MOMENTUM. When on a heavily geared SS/FG I gain as much speed as possible going into the hill and push hard to maintain it throughout the climb. Basic climbing tips: 

Actually your recovery should start on the bike. What I mean by that is the primary fuel used is carbohydrates and you should be re-fueling throughout the ride even at the end of the ride. Carbohydrates are easy to digest and provide highly efficient energy. Hydration is also key as well. Post ride, the optimal window for glycogen restoration is 30 minutes once exercise stops! Your muscles are depleted and craving carbs. Once you get into the habit of doing this, you will be shocked if you miss this window how much more slowly you recover. There is a lot of debate about protein to carbo ratios which I will not introduce here. Why not pure protein? It is takes way too long to digest and you miss the optimal window. If you are trying to build muscle mass, protein would be ideal, but as cyclists we do not want or need the mass. My recovery drink of choice: Organic Low Fat Chocolate Milk. For me it has the right balance/ratio of carbs and protein. Hope this helps!
