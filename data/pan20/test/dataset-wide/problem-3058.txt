This is a bit of a tricky question. Before speaking of historical views of homosexuality, it is very important to understand what is being spoken about. Prior to the 20th century, there really was no concept of homosexuality as we understand it today. In the late 19th century, the concept of homosexuality as an actual orientation was first proposed and referred to as 'sexual inversion.' (And that was in a book meant for mostly academic audiences, so it was decades before this became a widespread social idea.) Prior to that point, there simply was no concept of homosexuality as we understand it. There were many groups which opposed homosexual ACTS, but these were mostly viewed as crimes like theft, murder, etc. While there were certainly people who preferred to commit these crimes more than others, just like there are career thieves and petty thieves, the idea that those people would necessarily oppose heterosexual relationships was unknown. Likewise, the idea that a person was unlikely to commit homosexual acts simply because they are involved in a heterosexual relationship was unknown. Today we believe that homosexuality sets a person apart as a different KIND of person. It's not simply an act which anyone is liable to commit and which does not necessarily have wide-ranging implications about the person who commits it. It is important to keep this in mind when reading about historical attitudes toward homosexuality. Committing homosexual acts was seen as a moral failing, but not a systemic one. So why was it a moral failing at all? It mostly comes down to incorrect understanding of the purpose of human sexuality. In ancient Greece, for example, sex was seen as a power display. Those who penetrated were more powerful than those who were penetrated. Most of our modern ideas about sexuality are inherited from ideas that first gained widespread acceptance during the Industrial Revolution. The Industrial Revolution, and the fact it created a situation where adolescents were mostly no longer able to get a job which paid enough to support a family, led to widespread acceptance of the idea that bodily pleasure was destructive. In religious circles it was seen as impious, in secular circles it was seen as unhealthy. Basically any form of pleasure, including sexual pleasure, was seen as a potentially lethal weakness. People who were 'slaves to their passion' were seen as weak and corrupt. It all came down to productivity. Homosexual acts produced pleasure, but could not produce children. Pleasure was seen as a dangerous temptation, and failing to produce anything seen as a moral failure. It is important to note that even during the Industrial Revolution, the time during which religious ideas opposing sex really took center stage (they existed previously but were like Catholic views on contraception today... simply ignored in most cases. Families slept, and screwed, in common rooms. Children grew up exposed to sex from birth and the lower classes at least saw no reason to prohibit child sex play so it was universal and that led to a whole life filled with sex. What else did the lower class have to do for fun?), their opposition was quite different from the opposition we see today. They had, as did every culture except modern western cultures, a category of human relationship which we have somehow managed to completely eliminate - platonic romance. Platonic romances were romantic, but supposedly nonsexual, relationships between same-sex persons. Even married men and women were likely to have same-sex friends which they viewed romantically. They would exchange gifts, write love poems and songs for one another, pledge undying love, etc. When modern people read of these relationships they project modern ideas of homosexuality onto them which is really inappropriate and ignorant. They simply did not tie sex and love together the way we do. Sex was seen first as an entertainment, then as a lamentable necessity of the human animal. Though not related to homosexuality, I feel it important to mention the view of sexuality prior to this. Development of agriculture had even more impact on how people viewed sexuality, and we retain some of those beliefs today. It was the birth of sex being seen as something which should be controlled. Unlike tribal situations, where children were raised amongst the entire tribe, once people settled down and started agriculture it became very expensive for a man to raise a child which was not his own. This motivated men to control womens sexuality. This started the idea that a mans spouse and children were property of the man. 'Deflowering' a mans daughter was seen as a PROPERTY crime. We still retain vestiges of this. When someone speaks of "saving myself", and otherwise uses economic language when speaking of sexuality, this is where it came from. They are "saving" their value for a dowry for their father.

So we're talking about a mode of research that's not focused on primary research, but on solving real-world (i.e. industry) problems, by interdisciplinary teams formed of industry and academia, where industry's needs set the tone (and provide the funding). So it's not that academia makes no discoveries, but they're not necessarily found in academic laboratories. 

There are branches in philosophy and sociology of science that talk about Mode 1 vs. Mode 2 of scientific production. Mode 1 is the "classic" form of research, perfomed mostly in academia and driven by a linear improve-the-state-of-knowledge mentality that science has defined as its ethos for the last couple of centuries. Wikipedia defines it as: 

All these shows (and other works of fiction) go back, at most, around 2,500-3,000 years. Anatomically modern man, so-called homo sapiens sapiens, is usually thought to have arisen around 150,000-200,000 years ago. So from an evolutionary viewpoint, these timeframes are mostly irrelevant - people haven't changed much between early Greek times and the Middle Ages, and neither have other animals. It's just too brief a period for major evolutionary change. What has happened to animals over that time is domestication - the artificial selection and breeding of animals, which began (according to Wikipedia), around 6000 years ago. I'm not entirely sure what horses looked like back then, though. Genetically they were similar to today's horses, but since we can see huge differences between different horse breeds, even though they're the same species, we can suppose that Spartan horses in the 6th century BC might have been different from horses used by Scandinavians in the 8th century AD. As for the question of how long they've been on Earth - it's hard to answer. "Horses", of some definition, have been around for millions of years, though only at some point could they be considered identical to today's horses. And as for why you keep seeing them everywhere, whether in historical accounts, historical fiction or history-inspired fiction is just because they're so useful. Horses were used by any civilization they were introduced to because they are strong, reliable animals for work and transportation. Goats are used for milk and meat and keeping greenery under control. Man domesticated animals for their usefulness, and horses and goats, alongside the rest of the farmhouse gang, are very useful. 

However, in the past decades, so-called Mode 2 science has risen to the forefront. Again, from Wikipedia, quoting Camille Limoges: 

You will not get anywhere by trying to divide events as historical or political. The same thing can be both, and it depends on how you approach it. History is any event that is approached with a historical mindset - using the tools of historical research. A political scientist or political commentator could approach the same events as political events. The distinction is not in the event. Therefore, I don't think you can set any cutoff point to determine if something is an historical event or not. Even a current event happening live - like, perhaps, Russia annexing the Crimea - is a historical event. Good commentary on it would involve a political commentator to give a political explanation of what is happening, but also a historian to give the historical perspective. Events do not occur in a vacuum, and there's always an historical context. The same can be applied to any relevant discipline. A movie comes out. Is this a cultural event? An historical event? An entertainment-history event? The answer is, of course, all of the above, depends on how you interpret it. 

The Cabinet Historique et topographique militaire was created by a decree the 28th August 1794. The decree goes in detail about the work and the organization to the point of naming who does what. A second decree (16/06/1795) has also elements of organization. The decrees don't mention office hours. The work done by the bureau in support of the armies was important but not time critical in a way that would need special hours. Even though the idea of office hours is somewhat anachronistic, the hours mentioned by Andrews would be odd. Nevertheless, there's no source for these hours. I would think then the Bureau had not odd hours (the other would be that its hours wouldn't be odd at the time, but as far as I know, they would be) and there's no source supporting such thesis. Also, the idea that a 8 hours day would leave a lot a free time is somewhat strange. It's not a big day but not a small one either. If someone can provide a source I'll happilly revise my opinion. As for Andrews: I couldn't consult Napoleon the Great. But the text it's the same in his Napoleon: A Life [the same book with UK title]. Andrews has only two references for the passage that don't justify the points of fact (even less the reasoning). A primary source, i.e. a quote from a letter that Napoleon wrote to his brother. A secondary source, p. 128 of a book from historian Howard Brown. Andrews use of Napoleon's letter is strange: "three days later [20/08/1795] he was crowing to Joseph: ‘I am at this moment attached to the Topographical Department of the Committee of Public Safety for the direction of armies.'" The full letter is available in translation. It starts "I am attached for the present to the topograpical board of the Comittee of Public Safety for the direction of the armies; I replace Carnot." It then goes on for a full page on completely unrelated matters. I don't see any crowing. Self-agrandizement (to replace Carnot?)? well it's Napoléon... As to the analysis of the Bureau functions it seems to be based on a page of Brown. I couldn't check this book but I would be surprised that it would bring something new to this answer (a part giving some credibility to Andrews ideas about the Bureau). The assertion about the hours goes without reference and its not clear that its source is Brown (there's another unrelated reference before the assertion).
