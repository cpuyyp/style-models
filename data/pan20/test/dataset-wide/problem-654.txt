The scenario: you're riding in a curb-adjacent, paint-only bike lane. You happen to look over your shoulder (or in your mirror) and see a vehicle approaching from behind, either fully in the bike lane, or close enough that they can't safely pass. Assume that veering to the inside of the approaching vehicle's path (away from the curb) is not an option, and that there is no time to slow and dismount onto the sidewalk. Is there any technique which can be used here to quickly lift the bike both up and to the side, while traveling at speed, such that you could safely continue your ride on the raised sidewalk until the danger has passed? Answers that do not require suspension would be ideal, and it would be especially helpful (though improbable) to find a technique that can also be used while carrying reasonably-weighted (~10 pounds) panniers on a rear rack. 

I ride a hybrid cycle to/from work each day (10 km / 6 US miles each way). The handle bars are flat, and I ride with my thumbs gripped around the handle and 2 fingers close to or over the brakes (I feel safer). Last year I rode every weekday without problems, but this year I am getting some pain in my front shoulder muscle on my right side. I was doing 20 chinups and 50 pushups each day, so I cut these out for a while to see if it would help. I'm still cycling and still getting the pain. It hurts most when I sleep at night (I am a side sleeper) and when I wake up I feel the pain in a small area (front deltoid). I am wondering if other people had similar pain and any suggestions? Perhaps riding with my seat higher, or riding a racing bike would help, or even those little "verticle handles" that can be attached on very the end of my handle bars pointing upwards. Maybe my muscle development was assymetric with all the exercises that hit the front (cycling, pushups) without balancing exercises for the back? I'm 39, 6 foot / 86 kg and in otherwise very good physical shape. Thanks for any tips / advice PS. I'm a computer programmer by trade and use my right arm often during the day with the mouse.

This is the first time I've heard of such thing. Here's my analysis of it. I'm assuming the magnetising of the drive train is referring to the chain and rear sprocket (if it's a hub motor). These components could theoretically become magnetised through rubbing if they travel through a magnetic field in one direction (either north to south poles or vice versa). They have to contain iron for this to work. Ebike motors are mostly brushless, which have permanent magnets inside. And also the chain and sprocket is often made of stainless steel (more below). So it sounds possible that those components could be magnetised as you would mostly pedal forwards. However, here are some doubts to whether it needs to be demagnetised: Magnets made from rubbing are only temporary. They lose their magnetic field over time and knocking. The magnetic field around a brushless motor is complicated, as there are multiple permanent magnets inside arranged in a circular fashion. So any rubbing may be cancelled out by this arrangement. Some stainless steel actually can't be magnetised. I haven't checked yet but you can by holding a fridge magnet and see if the chain and rear sprocket reacts to it. The only debris that would stick due to magnetism is ferrous materials. Most debris in cities are not. But that would largely depend which geographical area you're in. In conclusion, I'm very doubtful whether this is needed at all. And as you've mentioned, there are magnetic sensitive sensors on some Ebikes. Demagnetising could potentially damage them and the motor. Some sites I used to confirm my understanding: 

I am working to improve my segment times on Strava riding 10km to/from work. My average speed is 32 kmph, and over short segments (1km) I can set avg speed 44 kmph / max 49. Over the last year I have invested in a new bike and bike shoes, and now I leave a week's supply of clothes in advance in my work locker so that I can ride without a backpack - all of these improved my strava times. Now, I am wondering if my "standard" bike helmet is a source of wind resistance that can be improved. Is there a sort of bike helmet that is more aerodynamic? For example, a tempo helmet, or a helmet that doesn't have the "cooling" holes? What features and considerations should I look for when buying a helmet, given I am most interested in riding faster. Cheers Viking Steve. 

Yes it's possible, but there are a few things to check before getting a new battery: Some battery systems communicates information to the controller. There are no standards here, so most likely different brands are not compatible. To know whether your battery has this, check connector between the battery and controller. If it's more than a simple 2 pin (positive and negative) connection to the battery, it's likely you'll need to get a battery from the same brand and ask them about whether it's compatible. If there's only a simple connection, then you're in luck, as you can use a generic battery as replacement. But there's still a few things to be aware of: 

I'm relatively new to mountain biking, and am considering purchasing a new, less expensive bike to help me learn to ride wooden obstacles (skinnies, curved bridges, etc.) without fear of damaging my "good" mountain bike in a hard fall. I've also wanted to pick up a snow bike (or "fat bike"), but can't really justify the cost considering my area gets, at most, 3 or so snowstorms per year. But looking at these two issues together makes me wonder: would the wider, lower-pressure tires on a snow bike make it easier to learn correct technique & feel for riding on slick, wooden obstacles? What would be the benefits/drawbacks of very wide vs. standard-width MTB tires in this scenario? 

Side note: because of the smaller capacity, you'll be using a wider charge and discharge range on the battery. For Li-ion batteries, this results in shorter lifespan of the battery. Just something you might want to be aware of. As a rule of thumb, you should get a battery size that will mean you only need to use max 80% of it's full capacity before recharging. This will greatly enhance the lifespan compared to a 100% charge / discharge each time. 

Stopping distance is definitely something to be aware of. As speed increases, the distance needed to stop increases non-linearly. For illustration, in cars, with 1 sec reaction time: 

I've just recently replaced the brakes on my MTB with a pair of Shimano XT hydraulics. The rear brake line was extremely long for my frame's routing, so I had to cut it and subsequently bleed the system. For the most part, everything seems to have gone well; the rear brake lever is now very firm and responsive, slightly more so than the front (which I did not shorten or bleed). However, I've noticed that the rear brake lever no longer returns instantaneously. If I had to guess, I'd say it takes around 0.2 seconds to return from the fully depressed position. By contrast, the front lever returns so quickly that it makes a slight "snap" sound when it hits its limit. I replaced both the olive and needle insert when reinstalling the brake line. I noticed that both of these parts had a thick grease generously applied to them from the factory. I'm unsure if this is typical for Shimano brakes, though I've never seen pre-applied grease on the spares for Avid or Tektro brakes. I have a sneaking suspicion that this may be the culprit, but I'm not sure how to validate that without disassembling the brakes again and swapping in new connector spares. This doesn't seem to affect the brake's function right now, since the pads don't noticeably drag against the rotor during the return interval. But it does concern me that I may have done something wrong while reinstalling the brake line, and that this might be a precursor to more serious problems in the future. Any ideas what I might have done wrong, or how to further troubleshoot this issue? Some more details: 

What sort of speed improvement can I expect going from a $1000 hybrid bike (Merida Crossway Striker) to a $2000 road bike (Cannondale CAAD 10 - 105), all other things being equal? Presently I can commute to work (9km) in 17-18 minutes. It's mostly flat on a dedicated cycle path. I am hoping to shave maybe 30 seconds off my time. Is this a reasonable expectation? 

Up til now I have ridden with Strava running on my mobile phone sitting in a special mobile phone holder which sits up on my handlebars. Now I am looking for a better solution, both more aerodynamic for my new bike, and also with longer battery life (My present phone only lasts 2 hours with gps running). How do I select the lightest / best device that runs Strava? It obviously needs to be GPS capable. What features do I look for? Is it a smart phone? A smart watch? A garmin device? The device being light, comfortable, reliable and able to record rides of 4 hours or more would be ideal. Thanks for any suggestions.
