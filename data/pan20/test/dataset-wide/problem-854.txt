Also... Is there any way to get these percentages for systems that have primaries that are Giants (more than 2 Solar Masses) Major Stars (0.5 to 2 Solar Masses), and Minor Stars (0.5 Solar Masses... red dwarfs) I have found an article that says... Giant Stars = 80% have companions Major Stars = 50% have companions Minor Stars = 25% have companions Sources: $URL$ $URL$ $URL$ 

Or you could use some other arbitrary number, but you'd need to make that argument. I however think that a star density definition should be how we should define things "officially" because it is more or less how most people think of the galactic limits in the first place. Of course if you define it like that then you're dealing with issues like the New Outer Arm where the density falls off and then increases, the actual density isn't a perfect shape, and we might have to say that things we call 2 or 3 galaxies are actually 1 galaxy, such as the 2 dwarf galaxies orbiting the Milky Way or the where there exist 2 galaxies with a stream of stars between the two as they merge over millions/billions of years. 

What are the percentages of systems that have x number of stars in them? What I have found thus far is something like: 

I'm looking for the distribution of spectral types in the "giant" star category. This category is defined as basically B and O main sequence stars and any star that is larger than main sequences outside of it. My first thought was that the M, K, G, F, and A type distribution were the same as they are in the main sequence but then I realized M has to be dropped, and then i'm not quite sure how K, G, F, and A types evolve and usually only Red Giants are mentioned and I couldn't find numbers for the giants so I'm stuck. To be clear, I want to know the percentage of giant stars that are in each of the spectral types. So if there are 1000 stars in a given area and 100 giant stars in that areas I only want to know the percentage of each spectral type of the stars in that 100. 

Full answer: a conjunction like this 'nearly' happened on May 5th, 2000. NASA published an article about this event, stating: 

As @RobJeffries mentions, you can calculate the difference from the equations which define magnitude and flux. But this particular case is even covered in the Wikipedia article on apparent magnitude: 

Does Polaris have a trail in the sky timelapse? Yes. Every star has a trail, but it's smaller if it's closer to the pole. Polaris is close to the pole but it's still 45 (arc)minutes away. I don't think it's visible with the naked eye; no star trail is visible with the naked eye as you only see one 'instance' of the sky. What perhaps would work, and is more feasible for stars closer to the celestial equator, is trying to see the movement of a star compared to an object on Earth, e.g. a tree, a building or the horizon. The exposure times of the photos are different, as @J.Chomel notes in the comments. You can calculate the exposure time by looking at the arc length; in 23 hours and 56 minutes (a 'sidereal day'), a star will make a full circle. The trails on the last photo have an arc length of about 8 degrees, corresponding to about 30 minutes; the first two photos are more like 9 resp. 5 hours. Also, the zoom factor (of the lens) may play a role; if a photo is zoomed in more, Polaris' movement is more likely to be visible. I'm not sure if this plays a role in this photos, though. 

I'm very sorry for you, but this is just (mathematical) probability at work and no (astronomical) pattern. I'm on mobile right now so I can't do a full analysis, but note that if you divide Mercury's period (3520.2) by 89 instead of 88, the result is 39.55. Still pretty close to 39.88. In other words, the larger the numbers get, the easier is to find a 'divisor' close to 39.88. 

One would not, under normal conditions, die within seconds. This is a common trope in science fiction, but there has been quite a bit of real research into the subject. Let's speak on each point. 

In this video there is blue diffused sunlight present in the atmosphere. At any point where you might expect blue light to be diffused from the Moon, there is also blue light diffused from the Sun being added back into what you see. To know for sure, you would need to have a recording from night. The density of air could also be a consideration. The perspective in the video shows the moon from above cloud clover passing below cloud cover. The further the light passes from the Earth's surface doesn't only result in less distance spent in the atmosphere, but also the density of air throughout the entire passage. 

As noted the radiation and temperature is not terribly dangerous, but with no way to repressurize the room this can quickly turn fatal. The Russian Soyuz II mission ended catastrophically when the capsule carrying the cosmonauts depressurized on way for reentry, killing all three crew members on board. A valve malfunctioned during the reentry, causing depressurization. The craft was recovered after reentry and had not taken any significant damage. It was believed that Patsayev had made attempts to fix the valve in order to save the crew, but unfortunately there was simply too little time to accomplish this. Initial reports suggested that the crew had died of asphyxiation, however autopsies showed that the cause was hemorrhaging in the brain - reportedly caused by oxygen and nitrogen in the blood boiling. Not sure how this works out with Landis's claim that blood does not boil. Radiation Will Make Astronauts' Trip to Mars Even Riskier Richard A. Kerr Science 31 May 2013: 340 (6136), 1031. [DOI:10.1126/science.340.6136.1031] 

(Note however that the research here is actually attempting to avoid such instabilities, and they accomplish this by adding even more mass, such that the body can support even greater rotational velocity without encounter instability. Additionally, they're trying to create millisecond pulsars, but we don't need to do this as they exist naturally, so we could save ourselves a lot of time by (very carefully) approaching an existing millisecond pulsar) I don't think this would exactly be breaking apart (despite Wikipedia's use of that exact verbiage to describe it), but it allows for the return of mass that was at one point in a neutron star. Of course, chances are our theoretical neutron star miners are very likely to be the ones who put that mass on the neutron star to begin with. On the other hand, this (hopefully) accomplishes the task without reducing the object to a quark star or black hole. 

Sol is about in the middle betwen the center and the classically defined edge. We have a density of about 1/4ly stars. It gets much denser within 5kly of the center of the galaxy, not sure how the density falls towards the edge. We also have the spiral arms which are density waves which are less dense outside of them... Beyond this there isn't much more of an exact answer due to not be able to see beyond 100 or 1000pc of Sol. As far as density beyond that, just look up the equation for volume of a cylinder, you can get that from the density in the wiki page if you find the volume of a sphere or cylinder (which is what you need beyond 1000ly radius) and then just divide. 

It is argued that the edge of the galaxy has the halo of dark matter at around 100,000 light years, but there are arguments that extend the galaxy from anywhere between it being 120,000 to 200,000. The major factor though for putting the edge at around 100,000 light years is that there is a major star density fall off for no known reason. Similarly the depth of the galaxy is said to be 10,000 ly at the bulge and 1,000 ly for the rest of the galactic plane. There is similarly no reason for the fall off in star density in that direction known. And there are massive xray and gamma ray structure coming out of the galactic center that is 50,000 ly on either side which you could argue is the real edge of the galaxy along that axis. So what lies at the edge of the galaxy depends on how you define the edge of the galaxy which could be: 

In the Gliese catalog there are a bunch of prefixes, such as GJ, GI, Wo, etc. My question is do the numbers overlap ever? I tried to look it up, but nothing I could find was conclusive to me. 

Phone cameras just aren't designed to take good photographs of astronomical objects. The sensor is too small and the configuration options (like exposure time) are minimal. For astronomical photography, a better option is to use (the body of) a DSLR (or the analog version); the lens is provided by your telescope. Another option is a specialized CCD camera. 

By definition, it is zero; the ecliptic is the plane of earth's orbit (or rather, the inverse: the path the Sun seems to follow along the sky). But you're probably looking for variations in the axial tilt of the Earth. There's a lot of formulas in the article, and on the (astronomically speaking) short timescale of a few million years, it oscillates between 22 and 24.5 degrees with a period of about 41,000 years. See the graph below, the red dot is the year 2000: 

Is it moving straight to the west (i.e. it keeps the same distance from the horizon) or does it 'move with the stars'? Have you checked an online planetarium like The Sky Live? Based on the current information, it could just be Sirius, the brightest star in the night sky, or even Venus which is currently in her Evenstar period (but planets generally don't twinkle). 

Well, this radiation is way too small to be detected by itself, even if the black hole would be at our doorstep. However, the radiation makes the black hole less massive and smaller and finally it will vanish, producing a gamma ray flash which we hope is detectable, even from a very large distance. As @JamesK notes in the comments, this evaporation will take extremely long for the 'common' black holes caused by supernovae and those found in galaxy centers, but smaller primordial black holes, formed in the very beginning of the universe, could be evaporating now and that's why we have a telescope looking for those gamma ray flashes. 

As discussed here, the path of the Sun resembles a sine wave (see the image below), with a (semi-)amplitude equal to the axial tilt of the Earth, usually denoted $\varepsilon$, about 23.4 degrees. A simple formula, which might be accurate for your purposes, is the following: if $a$ denotes the right ascension (in hours), the declination $\delta$ is given by the following formula: $$\delta = \varepsilon \sin(2\pi\frac{a}{24h})$$ The actual formula is more complicated. From the formulas linked to by @barrycarter: $$\alpha = \arctan(\cos\varepsilon \tan\lambda)$$ $$\delta = \arcsin(\sin\varepsilon \sin\lambda)$$ we obtain $$\tan\alpha = \cos\varepsilon \tan\lambda$$ $$\frac{\tan\alpha}{\cos\varepsilon} = \tan\lambda$$ so $$\lambda = \arctan\frac{\tan\alpha}{\cos\varepsilon}$$ Plugging this into the declination formula, and using the fact that $\sin(\arctan(x)) = \frac{x}{\pm\sqrt{x^2+1}}$, we get $$\delta = \arcsin(\sin\varepsilon \frac{\tan\alpha}{\pm\sqrt{\tan^2\alpha+\cos^2\varepsilon}})$$ (here the right ascension $\alpha$ is measured in radians or degrees, not hours). 

As you've said, the definition of binary star systems would mean that the cases you are describing would not be considered binary star systems. That said, there are other arrangements which exceed binary, but are often thought of as including binary relationships. This is due to star systems which reach beyond binary often resulting in hierarchical arrangements. For instance, many triple star systems involve what is largely a close binary star system with a third star that orbits the pair at a much greater distance. For an extreme example of this, consider Castor, which is a sextuple star system containing three binary star pairs. These systems wouldn't technically be said to be binary star systems, but rather to contain binary pairs, but given the question I can't think of a better way of having a binary star system that isn't a binary star system. Note that the hierarchical nature of super-binary systems is a matter of system evolution. Systems which would not be considered hierarchical are believed to be unstable, which would eventually result in the ejection of a star from the system. 

19390101 is the date (1939-01-01). The first zero (Marked as SC) is the station code, the second the recorded hour, and the third the recorded minute (H/M). Most of this is 0 due to being interpolated data. After this information, there are 72 remaining columns (numbered 1-72 above), which represents collected data consolidated in groups of 5 degrees, presumably starting at 0. Given the amount of interpolation of old data the value may be questionable, but newer data appear to be more complete. The data format might be a little overwhelming to work with, but you can organize it in excel quite easily - paste it in and each line break will form a row, then use the text-to-column function to break each data into its own column. 

Light refracts in the atmosphere, causing the light to scatter in many directions. This light scattering is what causes our day to be blue, our sunsets to be their red-orange-violetish colors and allows us to see the light of the Sun shortly before sunrise and after sunset. As this only begins happening in any significant amount after the light enters Earth's atmosphere, there should not be any notable difference in the color or intensity of light between you and the moon and any other part of the sky at a relative angle from the Sun. On the other hand, the foreground does not have direct light on the photographer's side (because it is nearly between the sun and the photographer) and there is a very limited amount of atmosphere to scatter light. As a result, less light will be coming to the camera from that direction.
