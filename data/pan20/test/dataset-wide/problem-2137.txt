This is the real question and the answer is more than you think. If we assume many tech workers have poor social skills, they probably underestimate the importance even in their current position. Here are some typical requirements in many job posting: 

Stick with the timeliness factor mentioned above. Once you get them trained to a level they are comfortable doing the task on their own, just let them know you are going to remove their entry from your system. Also, let them know what to do if they have any other problems of this nature besides entering them into your system. Maybe they should send an email for training, usage question and any other non-bug related incident. 

I would ask if potential bosses should be included, because this question is about one of the most unethical things I would have been asked to do. 

Go through this exercise with the before (month he thought you did more) and then after (the period of time you production decreased) on your own. You may discover that you are not getting more tickets done even by weight, so this may indicate you may be spending more time on other tasks: documentation, email, talking to clients on the phone, etc. Then you can have a conversation with your boss with hopefully some objective information about the amount of work you're doing. If there is a drastic discrepancy on the amount of weight your boss would give to a task, you may find where the problem is. However you go about it, you and your boss need to discuss this in more detail. 

If someone is willing to offer you a better job, then you should take it. However, you need to make sure your next position is better. 

As a manager, it would be more professional for you to focus on work outcomes rather than the appearance of being professional. You're in the business of creating software; leave the appearances to sales and marketing. Just make sure you're not eating in your private office. Leading by example usually works best. 

Somone has to establish priorities. This can be one of the pitfalls of self-managing teams. There will be projects/tasks that no one wants to do (cmon, admit it), so they never get done. Rarely will anyone attend your meeting because they have nothing else to do. The less influencial your boss is within the company, the harder this job is going to be. A solution may be to expedite getting your own team and resources for your projects. 

You need to start asking your boss, if not the CEO, what your responsibility is when it comes to managing this person. Once you know what those in charge expect, then you can approach her and act accordingly. This can range from treating her like everyone else, so she learns what it means to have a job and follow directions or your boss doesn't want to upset the CEO so you need to just let it go. Just make sure you get the straight information and you find out how anyone else in the company would be treated for noncompliance. If it's not a fireable offense for others, it's not for her either. 

Don't feel like you need to give immediate answers. Suggest to your coworkers that you take some time to look into the problem and set a time-line to get back with them. If they push for an immediate response, remind them about the negative feedback you've received and emphasize you're working on them and prefer not to commit them at this time. The more desperate they are, the more likely they'll offer to over-look them. Work on your responses. Limit the points to make initially. If you're asked for more detail, have a few of those ready. As developers, we know we have to deal with the details and edge cases, but many people don't work that way. Give them straight-forward answers. Elaborate when necessary. If you're wrong, seems like this group would let you know. If they're so concerned with the correct answer maybe they'll learn to ask someone else. 

Take the interviews. You owe it to yourself to improve your job finding skills. Most people don't advertise what they'll pay, so how else can you be certain where you stand in the job market until someone else offers you another job? There are a few things in the workplace that you just don't talk about and some assumptions people make. The "are you wasting someone's time" factor goes both ways. Recruiters: 1. Will never tell you that you're not the top choice and will interview you anyway. 2. Are sales people and will at least want the opportunity to talk you into the job. 3. Some positions are practically already filled, but for some regulatory reasons, they have to interview at least 3 people. Rarely will you find anyone who is completely open about where you stand before having an interview. There is always a chance you may discover during the interview process that the position turns out to be better than the one you have. If you're open-minded about the job market and are eager to advance, no job interview is a waste of time. I turned down my last offer 4 times and on the 3rd one, I really thought I would take. I think both parties learned a lesson on this one. It's only a waste of time if everyone doesn't learn something from it. If a company can't apply what they learned from failing to hire me, that's not my problem. 

I think you're dealing with someone who doesn't really want to help you. If you're going to stop asking questions, you've probably help him reach his goal. You have to persevere. Be explicit in your need for more details. You may find that he has other time demands that limits his ability to help you. This could be a case where the two of you need to speak to a supervisor about how to handle the lack of time. Maybe something can be taken off of his plate. Onboarding is not easy for technical positions and can take more time and energy than some people realize. Some projects or tasks need to be moved back. Hopefully, everyone realizes you're just trying to do your job the best you can. No one wants to be a drain on everyone else. Based on the fact that this person was instructed to help you, no one should think you don't have the horsepower to figure things out on your own. Asking for the name of the test server isn't something you can find on the web. 

Consider including in your quotes an amount of time for client meetings. After that, you can then charge for consulting. They key is to convey that your time is important and only so much of it is included in the price of your product. This way, they know in advance and can decide whether or not to do business with you. If it was such a big deal (as in you had somewhere else to be), why didn't you leave and schedule at a different time? 

It's great that your manager is highly regarded for his technical abilities, but because of his lack of political/social involvement, your group is being hindered. He thinks it is great that your team gets everything done for him. He has no reason to think you need additional resources. You get the job done. I suggest you inform your manager that you need more resources. My guess is many people including you in your group are over-worked and will probably burn out. Start taking time for these other activities. Use as an example of getting information too late because you're out of the loop. Insert yourself in the loop. You will probably have to push back on due dates. Your manager may not like it. Stop thinking of these activities as wastes of time, gossip or socializing (socializing at work is very important as you've discovered). If this is how your company does things, you have to do what you can to fit in the culture. Very important things are being discussed. In case your boss asks you what you've been doing, tell him how ineffective it is for you to be the last to know on everything, so you joined the party. 

Don't be so quick to avoid conflict. Some conflict is good, but everyone needs to know how to engage in it and how far they can go. Eventually, you have to stop debating and get things done. It's important that the leader brief new hires about what is currently going on and what input you expect from the new person. It doesn't sound like you did that. I once joined a team that was at the tail-end of a very difficult conversion. This project delayed the filling of the position I took which made everyone's job even harder. I felt like some people were being lazy. I was able to adjust my perceptions when I realized all the hours they were putting in previously and am very thankful I never voiced this opinion because I would have looked like a fool. It would then be very difficult to get everyone's trust if I would have accused them. As the leader, you have to decide if what Thomas is proposing makes sense in the context of this team and the current project. What may technically be the best strategy could be a poor choice if it means requiring your team to disproportionately use up time learning new technology and refactoring existing code. I prefer to never allow code or any other work product to be done in isolation. The greatest writers have had editors. No one is perfect. This is why code reviews are a common practice. Of course your team prefers to avoid any scrutiny which I think is bad. That doesn't mean the new guy gets to come in and tell everyone how bad they are without knowing all the factors. Thomas may need to learn how to be tactful. It may not be what he is saying as much as the way he is saying it. If he doesn't agree with a technology choice, he needs to learn not to interject conclusions like the others are just lazy and/or unskilled. Make sure you address everyone and let them know they are to act professionally and get things done. If that means Thomas has to just flow with the group, that's the decision the leader has to make. You may want to suggest to the others to not be so sensitive and if they're going to make technical choices, they better be prepared to justify them to their coworkers, management and clients. 

I don't know how much feedback you've given this person, so I think you need to be direct. When you see him with your cup, take another community cup, walk over to the person and ask for your cup back. He can pour what is left into the empty cup. This person is being intentionally rude, so you need to provide some negative consequences for stealing your property (And borrowing without permission is stealing.). 

You should address your plans for freelancing in your cover letter. Acknowledge you've been doing it with the permission of your current employer. Also, indicate whether or not you plan on continuing and whether or not you will leave it up to your next employer. If the type of work done under contract is similar to what you do on your current job, there's no reason to include it in a resume when looking for full-time work. The only reason I could think it is important is if you don't have a lot of experience or you're applying with consulting firms who may be interested in whether or not you can work with different clients. 

Ask someone at Company A for their advice. It may be common in this particular industry for HR departments to track where and why're they're losing intern candidates. This way, your company knows that the other company (B) also wanted to hire you and anything negative they could say about you would make them look foolish. 

Do some training if needed and focus on the idea that you built a way for them to take care of this themselves to save time. Most people prefer this anyway unless they feel it is too complex. 

I'm not going to pretend this is an enjoyable situation, but are there any other negative consequences? 

At some point in the interview process, your new employer should have known about your current status. They should ask when you can be available. Hopefully they want to encourage you to give ample notice. It's a sign of professionalism and I'm sure they don't want to hire people who don't care about these things. Ask your current employer how much time they need, but let them know you won't go beyond what is considered appropriate in your area of the country. There's no reason to burn a bridge here if you can avoid it. You never know; they may tell you your time is up when you give notice. 

Many companies, industries and departments have some sort of critical time and many employees are not allowed to take time off during them. Usually, everyone is aware of this and take these jobs with that understanding in mind. There's tax season, holiday retail shopping, end of quarter accounting, or selling fireworks on Independence Day. If you're working on different projects where these times aren't as predictable, that can be tougher. Try to have as much advanced notice as possible. If you don't have to have absolutely everyone all the time, create some sort of rotation to allow for coverage. The bad part is, you'll lose good employees if these crunch times occur too often or intrude on personal matters. No one will say this until it is too late because they don't want to jeopardize their job. I had a job that locked me into the month end accounting batch processing whether is was a weekend or not, so I was constantly looking for a job that didn't have that requirement and unfortunately for that company, it wasn't that hard.
