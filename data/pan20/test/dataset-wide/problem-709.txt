The same web page, "Complete bike parts kit" tab lists both 29" and 26" wheels as options, depending on frame size: 

Tires pumped up to max pressure may blow up at the spokes due to a poor rim tape. This does not happen immediately after or during the inflation process but it can take some time to develop. In one of my cases, I heard a blowout and hissing of air at 2 a.m. though I'd pumped them at 10 p.m. Alternatively, it could be just a regular tire/tube puncture that took some time to develop, and a high pressure helped it to manifest itself. Which is good — now you can fix it at home, not on the road. Open the tire, get the tube and inspect it. If it blew up at the rim, check the rim tape as well as it will blow up again with another tube if not fixed. If it is just a regular puncture, simply change the tube. If you do not know how to change a tube in a tire, take your time and follow one of the numerous on-line guides. 

The crank does not generate power. A human does. As such, crank length is only a part of equation to get power (in Watts): P = F×l×ω, where F is the force one applies (Newtons), l is the distance between axle and pedal (meters) and ω is angular speed (radians per second). The higher the force and rotation frequency, the more the power. Certain crank lengths may be more comfortable for a given human, thus allowing to achieve higher resulting power. I assume the optimal crank length depends more on legs' geometry, but I doubt that there is a ready equation for that. And do not forget clearance issues — if you take a crank that is too long, it will start interfering with frame or even ground. The only way a crank could be able to limit power is if it would be possible to break it by applied force. That would require an inhuman strength. So it is not the crank or even not a bike, it is human. Cranks and bicycles are literally levers in mechanical sense, and the golden rule of mechanics states that no advantage in power can be achieved with a lever. 

Any regular mountain bike wheel with diameter 26 inches, rim width between 20-30 mm and a freewheel would likely to work. Cheap wheels in this category cannot be too wide for you, and absolutely most of them have 135 mm hub width and QR skewer to attach the wheel, which should be what your frame's rear dropouts will accept. You will also need to buy matching tires (anything from 26" × 1.5" to 26" × 2.1" to your liking), inner tubes (almost any marked as 26" will do) and a cassette that fasts to the wheel's freehub. The choice of cassette depends on how many gears your rear derailleur has; for an 8-speed derailleur you will need a cassette with 8 cogs etc. 

That depends on what "feel" you want to have from your shock. If you never tried both types of suspension medium (coil vs air), you cannot choose for yourself in advance which one you you would prefer, as it is a taste question. Maybe you will feel significant difference, but it would be caused by the fact that the new shock is new and of higher tier quality. Maybe you won't notice any difference at all. 

It can be called "standing sprint" if used by a road race bicyclist during a race/training. At MTB, it can be associated with "attack position", where one leaves the saddle momentarily (or for quite prolonged periods of time in fact, thanks @mattnz) to not be thrown out of the bike by the saddle launching the rider into space. For regular commuters, Sheldon Brown considers the need to stand up while pedaling as a sign of a bad technique or poor bike fit: 

It is the internal distance between rear dropouts that defines the replacement QR skewer. The existing skewer can be used as a supplementary information. That distance also matches the hub locknut-to-locknut distance, but the latter is harder to measure because it is hard to insert the caliper between spokes. The image taken from Sheldon Brown's page. 

As the comments to the question reasonably state, the problem of dissimilar metals contacting is really not applicable in the case of a fork and a headtube, because there is no direct contact. 

Several ideas are below. You can try to find the vendor of your brakes by net-searching for your bicycle name and model year and then looking after the parts list that comes with the bike. To help you figure out how to assemble parts, you can look at another already assembled caliper. You have two identical calipers on your bike and you've touched only only of them, right? If you have another caliper assembled, you can look at it as a reference of at least how externally visible parts should be connected. You can find reassembly manuals for other vendors' calipers and use them as an inspiration material. That would not help you directly but it may simplify understanding of how things are supposed to work. After all, the operation principles of mechanical brakes are the same. For example, Avid BB5/BB7 disassembly/reassembly manuals are available on the net. Lastly, I do not think these are all details that you show on the picture. It seems like two bolts holding the caliper body together are missing, and I cannot find the part that might be dedicated to a pad position adjustment. 

It was extra sad because I changed a faulty hub on the same wheel barely several months before that, and the first hub only did 40 km. 

If the chainring/cassette are only moderately worn, you could try to wait until the new chain wears a little. Then the unpleasant sound may go away. This, and flipping the chainring, helped me on my singlespeed. Oiling the new chain more than one would regularly do may give a short relief but in general it will not help in the long term. In any case, no guarantee when the noise disappears. To understand how worn your drivetrain is, measure your old chain's length relative to a new one. There are cheap devices available for that. An increase of 0.5% (for an 11-speed chain) means it is heavily worn, and so is the rest of the drivetrain. 0.25% or less means moderate wear. 

Factors that decide whether or not a certain tire width fill be compatible with your bicycle are many. This applies to any transition that keeps the tire diameter (29 → 29+, 27.5 → 27.5+, 26 → 26+). The most important, in my opinion, are the following. 

There are several (five) questions in your post, and it is hard to answer all of them at once. Comments seem to answer some of them, and I would refer to manufacturer's manuals of respective parts you've installed for identification purposes. The third thing (silver ring) is Mavic's spacer for 10-speed Shimano cassettes placed on their freehubs. If you use 11-speed cassette, then you don't need it. 

Where things may bind is where heterogeneous surfaces contact and do not move relatively to each other. The most notorious pair is seatpost and seattube. For a titanium fork, the stem/steering tube contact point should be something to watch for instead. 

So you need first to make sure that your bike runs wheel size 26", as Ryde Taurus rims are 26". Having smaller wheels on a frame designed for bigger wheels is possible for disk brake systems, but it is not recommended unless you are certain (i.e. you have already tried it) you will be fine with changed (worsened) bike handling. 

As this hub has pressed-in cartridge bearings, it means that the axle sits pressed into the inner races of both bearings and cannot be extracted without some sort of smashing process. This is meant to be done when your are about to change both bearings as they are not designed to be reused after extraction. All in all, it is expected that you are unable to extract the axle at this point. The lock nut is unrelated to axle being "stuck". If you screw on two locknuts on another side of the axle again, you can use them to place a counter-action wrench and thus be able to unscrew the thing from the other side. 

Measure the distance with a caliper up to 1 mm accuracy. The most common modern values for QR-designated rear dropouts are 135 mm for mountainbike and 130 mm for road bikes. Other things I've heard of are 170 mm and 190 mm for fat bikes and 132.5 mm "gnot right" specific to Surly bikes. For a new QR skewer it is important that its unthreaded length is not too long, otherwise you will not be able to thread the locknut tight on it. 

The good thing is, even after all these crashes most of the riders were able to walk away from them more or less fine. That stresses proper use of personal protection. P.S. Every bicycle user manual that I've read (and I am one of those weird people who actually read manuals to things) states that bicycling is inherently dangerous activity. Not just MTB but any cycling. So, wear protection appropriate to your discipline, know your skills and improve them, regularly take care of your bike, and have fun! 

The difference between 165mm and 150mm is 10%; it wouldn't come without a notice. I would not recommend doing that unless you have a chance of trying it and then going back if you don't like it. 

The body fixing bolt part 13 is clearly detachable. It is only a question what size of a hex key is needed. Here's a view on how it is done: 

If the damaged wheel comes with a cheap to midrange bicycle, it should not be fixed for economical purposes. What you should do is to buy a new matching wheel. Otherwise the cost of replacement rim, new spokes and nipples plus manual labor of a wheel builder may easily overshadow the cost of a complete factory-built wheel. If you are really determined to save the most of the wheel, you should look for a matching replacement rim. Fixing the current rim is unrealistic as there is no ready equipment for that, and DYI would most likely make an unbalanced wheel or unreliable fix. Sad things like this happen. I was backpacking once and discovered that my rear rim cracked exactly at the midway point of my trip. Managed to get back home safely and made this picture: 

Water will always find a way to enter the frame, if not through the bolt hole then via the seat tube or head tube or gas exhaust holes. Turning the bike upside down will not be very effective unless you fall into a river often. What you can do is 1) make sure that water has regular ways to leave the frame; 2) use special coatings on the inside surfaces to inhibit or prevent rust ; 3) perform regular maintainance to prevent bike parts from binding together. The lowest point of the frame is its bottom bracket shell. That is where all water tend to come. Check if the frame has a hole there so that water can drip out. You will need to strip your frame before applying a rust inhibitor. See a good guide here: $URL$ Lastly, you should put grease at the places where the frame holds other parts: bottom bracket threads, seatpost, quill stem (if you have a threaded one ). That would prevent parts rusting together, making it impossible to detach them later. 

Because you said you have disk brakes, it is unlikely that the unevenness is in the rim/tire. It must be something at the hub. Because you said it is visible at the rim, it is not a bent brake disk (unless you have both rim and disk bent). It is also unlikely to be loose bearing cups, though I would have checked them as well. When the wheel is not rotating, try to wobble it sideways with your hand. If it does wobble, tune up the hub. The last possibility is that the wheel's axle does not sit properly in the dropouts, i.e. it is not installed correctly as the whole unit. Loosen the quick release skewer or nuts that hold the wheel and make sure that you've pressed it all the way in the frame's dropouts before closing skewer or tightening the nuts again. 

We do not know how often and how hard these bicycles were crashed before they finally gave in. Damage, especially in carbon parts, is not easy to see without special equipment. Quite a few crashes in the video were caused by front wheel detachment. That's not frame but fork issue or rather user installation error. A couple of episodes demonstrate just direct crashes. Nothing is guaranteed not to break after that. I am not sure that all of these bikes were used in their intended discipline. I've had bad experience riding an XC hardtail on an DH course.
