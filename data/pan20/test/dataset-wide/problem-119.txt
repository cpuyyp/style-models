General Backstory: Humans have advanced enough that they are capable of simulating, entire solar systems that have sapiens life. Earth was destroyed not long after the singularity, because of some experiment that goes wrong in a new scientific field. Two centuries later, whatever a new scientific discovery happens, they begin their experiments in a simulated reality before they do it in ours. The problem is the total disregards of the sapiens life in the simulations by our society they are not considered people (because they are fake, created by humans) with is ironic by a society that has the technology to upload minds to a computer and laws regarding the equality between a.i. and humans. My novel: A certain enterprise simulates, a world loosely based on fantasy worlds, with creatures more dangerous than anything, including something like the dinosaurs. The world has several "species" (more like Neandertals and our other ancestors) of sapients. Each species has a specific group of modifications (that are the prototypes without the limitations that are dictated by the law, the modifications will be available in future decades) that give them the abilities necessary (barely?) to survive their environment. My question: Is regarding, the technological level that the sapients will have, I don't know how to make plausible explanations of why they are behind even the industrial revolution, of course, some extinct sapients have reached nuclear energy but destroyed themselves blowing each other. I came up with two that combined maybe can achieve what I want. The first is a protocol in the simulation that slows down advancements regarding energy technologies and the second is that the planet is very harsh, even if the sapients survive the majority of their predators and even hunt them too, there are some that are impossible (Megalodon but in the ground?). PS - I don't write English very well, please have patience with me. 

Have you considered making it a sexually transmitted disease? The kind of ant infection you are interested in is very unlikely to scale to a whole human body. It operates not through hormones or neurotransmitters, nor brain manipulation, both of which are more likely to work on a large complex organism. Instead it overrides existing motor controls and sends signals to ant muscles directly, while the ant might be fully conscious. Even if it somehow gains the processing power to navigate a human body through complex environments, it would be a slow and inefficient process and give people too much time to notice and react. Humans also have a more powerful and very different immune system. Instead, shallow fungal infection is much easier and faster, and much less alarming than total body control. To achieve the goal of killing and eating humans, it could be sexually transmitted and destroy and consume human reproductive cells and fetuses, which at least some people consider human beings - even if you disagree, the goal of destroying humanity would still be achieved. To speed up spreading, it could use its muscle-controlling powers to affect human sexual behavior and make its host continually stimulated and have more pleasure/last longer, so they will have sex with more people(but not so obvious to be alarming), and this would be easier and require less "intelligence" than controlling the whole body. People may even willingly get infected even after it's found out if it doesn't otherwise negatively impact their lives too much. If you are being nice, just stop there. If you want to make it slowly destroy the host or turn them into classical zombies, this method can buy you time. A zombie apocalypse doesn't have look like "The Last of Us". In some sense, what the organism's behavior is helping to reproduce and evolve is what's really in charge. We could be living more or less normal lives and still be scientifically zombies if all human achievements and desires and relationships would only serve our invisible fungal masters. 

I would say you should look at Jewish Diaspora in Europe: since dispersion they were able to maintain a high cohesion among it's people, develop distinct philosophical thought, and for long time maintain certain level of self-governance within host nation's. Not exactly empire, but still enormous achievement for exiled nation, and it answers the question whether people disperse among other nation's can maintain cultural identity. 

Kassam-type rockets (simplified version of Soviet Grad MLRS rocket) especially if you can also master real explosives for warhead (like dynamite). They already can be produced with access to very low-tech equipment and should be doable in middle age workshop. Would change warfare pretty quickly: no massive charge of cavalry, walls of no use, naval warfare would change fast, etc. 

In Russian empire convicts were sent to Siberia for permanent settlement, as punishment and a way to identify them, those who commited grievous crimes (quite a wide definition at that time), would often have been cropped ( their ears cut off), and/or have their nostrils teared. Branding face (usually forehead) with hot iron was also common. Cutting off limbs was much less common, as made inmate unfit for forced labour. Provided authorities with difficult to hide way to identify prisoners. 

So do other changes that were done to the person's body persist during and after the change, or are all unintended changes automatically corrected until the person changes into an exact copy of the target? Like, if he is hungry, hurt, or learned something new, would it matter when the transformation is complete? What if he died? And is the target state a "snapshot" of the other person at the time of spell casting, or a continuously changing state of the living other person? If these changes don't matter, I guess the person would be very confused(under strict physical explanations of consciousness). If furthermore the target state is a static snapshot, he would be practically unable to remember anything or keep doing anything for any length of time as information in his brain is overwritten, probably trapped somewhere or wandering in the street not knowing where he is or how he should do the random task that were on the target's mind. Otherwise he will behave disoriented if the target state is changing, as new experiences and intentions keep flowing into his brain and old stuff are wiped out. His knowledge will be disrupted and incoherent, as memory is somewhat distributed and a partial change will end up with lots of mixed and matched facts and silly associations, probably like those we experience in dreams. If however the spell is not self-correcting, things get much worse. Like, the immune system could attack partially transformed parts of the body, unless the spell can keep the changes to so many types of cells in the immune system, existing antibodies, and antigens in perfect synchronization. Any difference could lead to bad autoimmune reactions that will not get corrected, and unlike in the previous case, the person could just die. And memory is actually volatile, each time we recollect something our brains have to store it again into long term memory or it's lost(or so I'm told). So while mental inconsistencies are just a temporary inconvenience in the previous case, it will cause partially transmitted memories from the target to be overwritten by old/wrong ones as the person will certainly be constantly trying to reflect, wondering what the **** am I remembering? The transformation will not be safe or accurate unless the person is put into metabolic stasis(sleep is not goo enough, memory processing happens during sleep too). 

Before getting to technicalities (branch of knowledge, skills worth preserving) you need a highly self-organised self-governing group of people with a sense of mission that could do the job. Most likely they would be followers of religion that gives you sense of living and death, gives meaning to your suffering and strength to not be fearful of death and allows for a rise of some kind of warrior code (maybe among caste/clan of warriors). They would have a developed law system (not necessarily a complex one, but strictly adhered to), that will satisfy the need for justice and would be envyed by outsiders. In post-apocalyptic world they would appear most likely first as followers of some highly revered figure, maybe considered prophet. This group must also be self-perpetuating, either through recruiting new members, or natural growth. Preserving knowledge MUST be essential to its stated purpose: rebuilding God's Kingdom, or whatever purpose you give them. If the group considers knowledge evil and root of problems, they won't try to preserve it. Examples: early Church communities, highland clans (these are less likely to be concerned about knowledge preservation), Jewish people throughout most of their history, etc. Once you have your group and where it exists (decaying cities, as early Church in late Roman Empire; group of highly protected sheltered compounds in srarcely populated areas, what would likely be a feature of some reclusive Christian denominations in US) it can be easier to determine what kind of knowledge they need, as it is highly unlikely they could or will attempt to preserve all knowledge.
