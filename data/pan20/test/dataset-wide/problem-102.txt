Mages that powerful are likely to be in charge. ~They~ build (have built for them) the walls to keep non-mages from bothering ~their~ cities. Mages own the cities; they aren't going to be in the employ of some non-mage foot-slogger. Walls exist to allow for gates. The existence of gates as the only means of access to a town or city forces all traffic through a bottleneck - this allows for control, of people, of trade (taxing goods to generate revenue for the city). If you want gates, you have to have walls high enough to stop people climbing over them. Walls - of some kind - exist to separate the civilised from the wild. Keep your livestock behind a wall and the wolves won't eat them; keep your valuables behind a wall, and they are safe from itinerant thieves and beggars. They also foster in-group identity: "those within the wall" vs "outsiders". 

Motivation. If you become overwhelmed, burnt out, unable to get by day-to-day, summoning a (leaner, meaner) more motivated version of your past self might give 'you' an opportunity to clear the decks, so that when you return to you, your day-to-day existence all the things you didn't have energy for are now done. This would probably rely on the things needing doing being things you would have done before - so if you were once really into DIY, decorating etc., but no longer have mental energy for, you could summon your past self, and when you wake up, you house has had a makeover! Same logic might apply to any complex task (re-building a classic car, organising a database etc., depending on what is was you used to be motivated to do.) All assumes your past self will be cooperative, of course! 

You should look into Population Viability Analysis, and Minimum Population Size. For conservation purposes PVA tries to model non-extinction to 1000 years. This study suggests conventional estimates for MPS - at least 500 adults - are off by at least an order of magnitude (so suggesting a minimum population of 5000 to have a reasonable chance of survival to 1000 years). The problem with PVA is that is requires multiple assumptions, and the further forwards you project, the less reliable your point estimates. I'd suggest either really getting into PVA, or picking some suitably large ball-park, at least in the tens of thousands. That's going to be some large space ship. Either that, or a smaller population, cryogenically frozen (if possible). 

The problem with really high altitude is going to be more than growing food - how do the people survive (too cold, not enough oxygen)? If altitude is lower, say in line with the Ethiopian Highlands, then you could grow grass (and raise livestock) on the roofs of all the buildings. However, you may have relatively small human populations in these cities, as the area of land necessary to support them will otherwise probably be larger than the total area of roof-space (see this post for some relevant details). It might be possible to harvest flocks of birds attracted to any arable crops your citizens plant, but scale issues will likely remain - real medieval cities needed large areas of 'countryside' to support their populations. If you're willing to 'bend' the rules about your benders, then you could potentially overcome the lack of oxygen and temperature issues associated with high altitude, and if you're willing to postulate flying cities, then why not postulate fictitious, nutritionally dense, food that can be grown in the space available? (edit: I've ignored the water issue: I assume that your 'water benders' can extract some from the air - included exhaled water vapour - and otherwise recycle urine into drinkable water. If not - as the comments note, water will be THE issue) 

The key to answering this question lies in its premise - that the hunter-gatherers are (some of) the survivors of a war; they are the product of the society/ies that waged the war, not a marginalised group that has already been pushed into marginal habitats by agricultural people. Thus consider who would most likely adopt such a lifestyle - presumably those already most suited to living off the land. It would seem logical that these 'new' hunter-gatherers would be drawn disproportionately from the military, and even from special forces (and even if not disproportionately initially, a few seasons of unsuccessful foraging by the less experienced would result in this distinction). So, for these people, a hunter-gather lifestyle offers the advantage of near continuous training in the abilities necessary to operate as a guerrilla army/armies. High levels of physical fitness (at least in terms of endurance/stamina), passing undetected through various habitats (or they don't get to eat - they'll need some level of animal protein), stalking and ambush skills (depending on the nature of the available weaponry). If this persists for multiple generations, the initial ex-military composition and outlook could generate a culture that reinforced resilience, stealth, self-sufficiency and mutual support - essentially the skills valued in small teams of real-world special forces. They would still be subject to the constraint faced by all hunter-gatherers, that their numbers are limited by the availability of food within their hunting grounds, and so would rapidly come to be outnumbered by the food-rich urbanite agriculturalists (although the hunter-gatherers would likely enjoy better health: $URL$ Of course, these hunter-gatherers would also be the most skilled at raiding the supplies of the agriculturalists! If this scenario played out over generations, one could envisage a situation where these hunter-gathers would be valued as scouts, or special forces operatives, by the agriculturalists - agriculture-based civilisations typically end up going to war with one another. Or perhaps the hunter-gatherers offer such services in exchange for non-incursion into hunting grounds, and might be able to influence balance of power between their neighbours. One thing that is unlikely to happen in this post-apocalyptic scenario is the pushing of hunter-gatherers into increasing marginal habitats: they start with the military advantage, and will likely maintain it unless or until the urban societies develop more advanced technology (assuming, of course, the hunter-gathers can't just steal it...) 

I want to offer a contrary opinion to the question "Could such a creature evolve?", and argue, yes, minotaurs could evolve. Before starting, it is worth noting that the minotaur of greek mythology (i.e. THE minotaur) was a singular individual created by divine intervention; if we want to consider the possibility of minotaur evolution, we need to allow for the existence of a population of minotaurs, more like the minotaurs that populate fantasy RPGs, C.S. Lewis's Narnia etc. The key element in understanding how a human or human-like ancestor could give rise to a population of minotaurs is to recognise (assume) that typically minotaur traits are secondary sexual characteristics that emerge largely after puberty under the influence of a testosterone surge. (This limits the typical minotaur appearance to males; females would be substantially less "minotaur-like", and we expect/predict a substantial amount of sexual dimorphism, perhaps of a similar degree to that seen in gorillas where adult males can approach twice the body mass of adult females). This should get around any obstetric complications associated with a human-like mother giving birth to a horned bull-like head! Evolutionary Scenario: Imagine a pre-minotaur population where physical strength is important for male reproductive success. This may be because the environment poses particular challenges; because of violent confrontations between males of different groups (as in real-world chimpanzees); of perhaps because males' access to potential mates is mediately largely by competition between males - bigger, stronger males outcompete the smaller weaker ones, and father more (most) of the babies. This is seen in multiple real-world non-human primate species, so is not unreasonable. Imagine a male is born with a genetic mutation that has two effects: distortion of the skull (a hint of a bovine appearance), and increased responsiveness to testosterone at puberty, such that post-puberty this male is larger and stronger than other males. This will result in increased mating share, with his offspring inheriting these proto-minotaur traits. If we wanted to we, could also imagine that testosterone at puberty also exaggerates the bovine-like features of the skull; regardless, it may well also increase the aggressiveness of these males. Over time, the population would come be dominated by individuals (males) who have this proto-minotaur phenotype. Now imagine also that a genetic trait exists that is expressed in females that relates to mate-preference. Given opportunity to exercise choice (which might be just a matter of being more or less resistant to male mating approaches), females "prefer" (i.e. are more likely to mate with) more physically-powerful males. Particularly if the increased aggressiveness between proto-minotaur males led to a population structured into small groups, females might be able to skip out of one group and join another - not that different to the situation that seen in modern gorillas, where females choose which harem to join - and this leads (at least in this scenario) to inter-sexual selection that, over generations, exaggerates the proto-minotaur traits into full-blown minotaur. Horns, for example, extending and developing from initial small bony spurs of the semi-bovine skull, perhaps even acting as honest signals of the male's genetic quality even though they are exaggerated beyond useful, head-butting size/shape. For females on the other hand, we would not expect a significant increase in body mass over the ancestral population (perhaps a little, as it might be dragged upward by selection on male body mass), and the bovine-like features would not be as strongly exaggerated, but they would be noticeably not human. Female minotaurs should be smaller, less aggressive, and less bull-like. Social structure might mirror that seen in gorillas, with males holding harems, dispersing at puberty and spending time alone before assembling their own harems, but the need to hunt for meat - we're still assuming these minotaurs are (at least part-time) carnivores - would probably require cooperation between males to bring down large prey, so perhaps harems nested in a more chimpanzee-like community structure might work? (incidentally, this is what Edgar Rice Burroughs came up with for his fictional apes in Tarzan, but I didn't recall that until I got to this point in the argument). Note that this line of evolution would equip minotaurs with primate-like teeth, allowing for the exaggerated canines seen in much of the artwork, rather than the typical bovine dentition more suitable for eating grass. So an evolutionary argument can be mounted for minotaurs, that avoids both Goldschmidt's 'hopeful monster' speculation, and particularly unusual birth complications.
