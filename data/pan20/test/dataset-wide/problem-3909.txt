I am used to thinking of matrices in terms of linear transformations, but it occurred to me that skew-symmetric matrices are a potential counterexample. I can think of at least two examples in which skew symmetric matrices crop up: 

I am pretty sure that it is unknown how to prove such a theorem. (Edit: See the comment, this may no longer be true!) By sieve methods, if you could prove your claim for an arbitrarily small value of $\delta$ (and with a larger error term allowed), then you would establish the density of squarefree discriminants in your family (since the small primes are easy to handle). I presume that this paper by Poonen represents the state of the art. It is conditional on ABC, so if you believe Mochizuki's proof then you're done. Otherwise, you have to ask that the discriminant polynomial be "special" in some way, and use the fact that it is not just a generic polynomial. As you mentioned one approach leads to invariant theory, representation theory, etc. but as field counting goes our knowledge is so far limited to degrees $\leq 5$. (Of course if anyone does know how to solve this problem I would be very interested!)

There are many models for spectra, by which I mean a model category whose homotopy category is triangulated-equivalent to the stable homotopy category. In each model, there are ways to construct Eilenberg-MacLane spectra $HA$, where $A$ is an abelian group. In $S$-modules, this is described in Section IV.2 of this version of EKMM. In symmetric spectra, this is described in Example 1.14 of Stefan Schwede's book project (version 3.0). 

For this example, I can imagine an equivalence constructed more or less by hand. A functor in the Segal-to-Stasheff direction would involve some choices. References to more general results of the form "homotopy algebras à la Stasheff $\simeq$ homotopy algebras à la Segal" would be welcome. Here are some references I've looked at. 

+1 to Micah, read his answer first! As an addendum, the $L$-function of an elliptic curve looks like (and is) an $L$-function of degree 2. It has a certain conductor, which is defined in terms of the primes of bad reduction and which affects the analytic behavior of the $L$-function. But beyond that, there is unfortunately not a lot that is known from an analytic perspective for elliptic curve $L$-functions in particular. Once it is proved that they have analytic continuation and a functional equation, knowledge of where the $L$-function came from seems to be disappointingly useless for proving theorems. (With some exceptions, e.g., the value of the critical point; there is also the modularity theorem, etc. but I am not regarding that as "analytic".) There is a lot of general machinery, which is very well explained in Chapter 5 of Iwaniec and Kowalski for general $L$-functions in general. Beyond that, my impression (which could be mistaken) is that not a whole lot is known. 

I think Milne is right. If a prime $p$ does not ramify in fields $K_i$, then it does not ramify in their compositum. So you know that 5 can't ramify in $L$, because it visibly doesn't ramify in any of the quadratic fields. Moreover, PARI/GP tells me that the field generated by $x^4 + 2 x^2 + 25$ has discriminant $576$, but that the polynomial has discriminant $3686400$, so $5$ does divide the index of $M$ in $\mathcal{O}_L$. 

Here's an example of missing pullback in the homotopy category of spaces, related to Neil's and Qiaochu's answers. I'll work in pointed spaces, though we'll see that the argument also works in unpointed spaces. Let's say we work in the usual homotopy category (i.e., the localization with respect to weak homotopy equivalences). Assume that $$\require{AMScd} \begin{CD} P @>>> K(\mathbb{Z},2)\\ @VVV @VV {n} V\\ \ast @>>> K(\mathbb{Z},2)\\ \end{CD}$$ is a pullback in the homotopy category. This says that maps $[X,P]$ consist of the subset of $[X,K(\mathbb{Z},2)]$ of maps becoming null-homotopic after composing with $n \colon K(\mathbb{Z},2) \to K(\mathbb{Z},2)$, in other words, the $n$-torsion in $[X,K(\mathbb{Z},2)]$. Taking $X = S^0$ yields that $P$ is path-connected. Taking spheres $X = S^i$ yields that $P$ is weakly contractible. In particular, $P$ has the singular cohomology of a point. Now let $\alpha \colon K(\mathbb{Z}/n,1) \to K(\mathbb{Z},2)$ be a generator of $H^2( K(\mathbb{Z}/n,1); \mathbb{Z}) = \mathbb{Z}/n$. The equality $n \alpha = 0$ implies that $\alpha$ factors through $P$. This is a contradiction, since $\alpha$ induces a non-zero map on cohomology $H^2(-;\mathbb{Z})$. Remark 1. The argument also works in the naive homotopy category (i.e., spaces and homotopy classes of maps). The space $P$ might not have the homotopy type of a CW complex and we don't know that singular cohomology $H^2(P;\mathbb{Z})$ is represented by maps $P \to K(\mathbb{Z},2)$; we only used $H^2(P;\mathbb{Z}) = 0$. For the fact that a weak homotopy equivalence induces an isomorphism on singular (co)homology, see Hatcher Proposition 4.21. Remark 2: Let's adapt the example to unpointed spaces. Recall that for path-connected $Y$, the forgetful map $[X,Y]_* \to [X,Y]$ from pointed homotopy classes of pointed maps to unpointed homotopy classes of unpointed maps is surjective and induces a bijection $[X,Y] = [X,Y]_* / \pi_1(Y)$ to the set of $\pi_1(Y)$-orbits in $[X,Y]_*$; see Hatcher Proposition 4A.2. In the example above, taking $X = \ast$ yields that $P$ is path-connected. Taking $X = S^1$ yields that $\pi_1(P)$ has only one conjugacy class, hence is the trivial group. The rest of the argument goes through. 

In a context of blind source separation (e.g. you want to extract the voice of a singer from a song), many approaches consist in maximizing the independence between the components of a certain decomposition of an input signal. However, the signals are often considered only as random variables, although their temporal structure is often strong. I am interested in reading / learning / developing about an appropriate generalization of this approach where the signal is now modeled as a stochastic process (and even a diffusion process is it makes things simpler). So first I need a manageable definition and measure of the independence between the components of a stochastic process. For a random variable $X$ on $\mathbb{R}^n$, the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the joint and the product of the marginal distributions of $X$ is often used to measure the degree of independence between the components of $X$. It is written $$ I = \int p(X) log \frac{p(X)}{\prod_{a=1}^n p_a(X_a)}dX $$ where $p_a(X_a)$ is a marginal probability function. If $I=0$, the components are completely independent. How can I generalize it to stochastic processes? On this link $URL$ is given the definition of the independence between two stochastic processes. I guess this could lead to a formal generalization but I do not manage to write it. Can anyone do it? Besides, I am afraid it would lead to unpractical computations. So I am thinking that maybe with sufficient strong conditions on the stochastic process (which will not be worse than the usual ergodic random variable approach), one could simplify this expression up to a practical one. For instance, assuming that the process is solution to a stochastic differential equation, I am dreaming of the power of Girsanov theorem to compute the fraction in the above equation... Do you have the answers to my questions? Do you know any litterature on this topic? Any advice about the direction I should take? Thanks for your help. 

Cliched perhaps, but my fellow graduate students when I was in grad school. They're the ones that answered my questions when I got lost, shared their half-baked ideas and listened to mine, showed me just how many interesting fields of math there are and how many different perspectives people can have on the same subject, and cheered me on when things were difficult. 

Hello all -- I have the privilege of teaching an introductory graduate course in analytic number theory at the University of South Carolina this fall. What topics should I definitely cover? I'm not lacking for good material of course. I intend to cover much of Davenport; there is also Cojocaru and Murty's introduction to sieve methods; there is interesting elementary work by Chebyshev et al. on counting primes; there is also Apostol's excellent book; I could dip into Pollack's new book; and there are many other excellent sources as well. I should also make sure the students master partial summation, big-O, and the kinds of contour integration that come up in typical problems. I feel prepared to do a good job, and I will also have good people to ask for advice in my new department, but I would cheerfully welcome further advice, opinions, etc. from anyone who would like to offer them. Any thoughts? Thanks to all. --Frank 

In the introduction to [1], Badzioch writes: "Also, $A_{\infty}$-spaces can be viewed as homotopy algebras over the algebraic theory $T_{\mathrm{Mon}}$ such that the corresponding strict algebras describe monoids." He then points out that his main result specialized to the case of monoids yields an equivalence of homotopy theories $$h\mathrm{Alg}_{\mathrm{Mon}} \simeq \mathrm{Alg}_{\mathrm{Mon}}$$ between homotopy monoids à la Segal and (strict) topological monoids. Combined with the equivalence $$A_{\infty}-\mathrm{Spaces} \simeq h\mathrm{Alg}_{\mathrm{Mon}}$$ which he alluded to, this provides an alternate proof of the known equivalence $A_{\infty}-\mathrm{Spaces} \simeq \mathrm{Alg}_{\mathrm{Mon}}$ explained beautifully here. 

Consider the endomorphism ring spectrum $R = \mathrm{End}_S(H\mathbb{F}_p)$ of the mod $p$ Eilenberg-MacLane spectrum $H\mathbb{F}_p$. The homotopy groups of $R$ are the Steenrod algebra $A^*$ with reversed grading: $$\pi_n R = [\Sigma^n H\mathbb{F}_p, H\mathbb{F}_p] = A^{-n}.$$ This spectrum $R$ is an associative $S$-algebra (or $A_{\infty}$ ring spectrum). Moreover, $R$ is an $H\mathbb{F}_p$-module spectrum, say, using the $H\mathbb{F}_p$-module structure on the target $H\mathbb{F}_p$. In particular, $R$ is an $H\mathbb{Z}$-module spectrum. However, $R$ is known not to be an $H\mathbb{F}_p$-algebra spectrum. 

Here are two examples similar to Ben's answer, followed by an example with a path-connected space. Let $[X,Y]$ denote the naive pointed homotopy classes of pointed maps. We're comparing the (say, unreduced) singular cohomology functor $H^n(X;G)$ to the naively represented functor $[X_+, K(G,n)]$. As Chris pointed out, singular cohomology is representable in the derived sense, i.e., agrees with its value on a CW approximation of $X$. Example 1. Let $T \subset \mathbb{R}^2$ be the topologist's sine curve $$T = \{ (x, \sin \frac{1}{x}) \mid x \in (0,1] \} \cup \{(0,0)\}.$$ Its zeroth singular cohomology is the finite product $$H^0(T;\mathbb{Z}) = \mathrm{Hom}_{\mathbb{Z}}(H_0(T;\mathbb{Z}), \mathbb{Z}) = \mathrm{Set}(\pi_0(T),\mathbb{Z}) = \mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}.$$ Its zeroth naive cohomology is $$[T_+, K(\mathbb{Z},0)] = \mathrm{Set}(\ast,\mathbb{Z}) = \mathbb{Z}.$$ A CW approximation $S^0 \stackrel{\sim}{\to} T$ induces on zeroth naive cohomology the diagonal inclusion $\mathbb{Z} \hookrightarrow \mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}$. Example 2. Let $X \subset \mathbb{R}$ be $$X = \{ \frac{1}{n} \mid n \in \mathbb{N} \} \cup \{0\}.$$ Let me name the points $x_n = \frac{1}{n}$ and $x_{\infty} = 0$ for convenience. The zeroth singular cohomology is the countable product $$H^0(X;\mathbb{Z}) = \mathrm{Set}(\pi_0(X),\mathbb{Z}) = \prod_{n \in \mathbb{N} \cup \{\infty\}} \mathbb{Z}.$$ The zeroth naive cohomology is the subgroup $$[X_+, K(\mathbb{Z},0)] = \{ (a_n) \in \prod_{n \in \mathbb{N} \cup \{\infty\}} \mathbb{Z} \mid (a_n) \text{ is eventually constant}\},$$ which happens to be a free abelian group on countably many generators. A CW approximation from the discrete space $\coprod_{x \in X} \{x\} = \mathbb{N} \cup \{\infty\} \stackrel{\sim}{\to} X$ induces on zeroth naive cohomology the inclusion of said subgroup. Example 3. Let $E = \bigcup_{n \in \mathbb{N}} C_n$ be the Hawaiian earring, where $C_n \subset \mathbb{R}^2$ denotes the circle of radius $\frac{1}{n}$ centered at $(\frac{1}{n},0)$. There is a surjective map $H_1(E; \mathbb{Z}) \twoheadrightarrow \prod_{n \in \mathbb{N}} \mathbb{Z}$; see for instance Hatcher Example 1.25 or [1]. Dualization into $\mathbb{Q}$ yields an injective map $$\mathrm{Hom}_{\mathbb{Z}}(\prod_{i \in \mathbb{N}} \mathbb{Z}, \mathbb{Q}) \hookrightarrow \mathrm{Hom}_{\mathbb{Z}}(H_1(E; \mathbb{Z}), \mathbb{Q}) = H^1(E; \mathbb{Q}),$$ which shows that the first singular cohomology $H^1(E; \mathbb{Q})$ has uncountable dimension as a vector space over $\mathbb{Q}$. Indeed, the vector space $$\mathrm{Hom}_{\mathbb{Z}}(\prod_{i \in \mathbb{N}} \mathbb{Z}, \mathbb{Q}) = \mathrm{Hom}_{\mathbb{Q}}(\mathbb{Q} \otimes_{\mathbb{Z}} (\prod_{i \in \mathbb{N}} \mathbb{Z}), \mathbb{Q})$$ has uncountable dimension since $\mathbb{Q} \otimes_{\mathbb{Z}} (\prod_{i \in \mathbb{N}} \mathbb{Z})$ does. Now denote $W_n = \bigcup_{i=1}^n C_i \cong \bigvee_{i=1}^n S^1$ and consider the retraction $E \to W_n$ that collapses all the circles $C_i$ with $i>n$ to the basepoint. Take a CW complex $K(\mathbb{Q},1)$. Any (pointed) map $E \to K(\mathbb{Q},1)$ is (pointed) homotopic to a map which factors as $E \to W_n \to K(\mathbb{Q},1)$ for $n$ large enough. This shows that the map $$\bigoplus_{i \in \mathbb{N}} \mathbb{Q} = \operatorname{colim}_n [W_n, K(\mathbb{Q},1)] \twoheadrightarrow [E,K(\mathbb{Q},1)]$$ is surjective, and thus the naive cohomology group $[E,K(\mathbb{Q},1)]$ is countable. In particular, a CW approximation $X' \stackrel{\sim}{\to} X$ induces a non-surjective map on naive cohomology $[E,K(\mathbb{Q},1)] \to H^1(E;\mathbb{Q})$. Edit. For the record, I previously thought that a similar argument would work with integral cohomology $H^1(E;\mathbb{Z})$, but I had forgotten Specker's theorem $\mathrm{Hom}_{\mathbb{Z}}(\prod_{i \in \mathbb{N}} \mathbb{Z}, \mathbb{Z}) \cong \bigoplus_{i \in \mathbb{N}} \mathbb{Z}$. In fact, it turns out that said cohomology group is $H^1(E;\mathbb{Z}) \cong \bigoplus_{i \in \mathbb{N}} \mathbb{Z}$, as explained here.

Here is a partial answer to your question. Basically, the methods of Goldston, Graham, Pintz, and Yildirim (see here) have some bearing on your question. Look at the series $$\sum_{N < n < 2N} \bigg( \chi_1(n) + \chi_1(n + 2) + \chi_2(n + 2) \bigg) \bigg( \sum_d \lambda_d \bigg)^2$$ where the $\lambda_d$ are the usual Selberg sieve coefficients or some variant, and $\chi_1$ and $\chi_2$ are the characteristic functions of products of exactly one or two primes. Then I worked out a back of a napkin calculation using Theorems 7-9 in GGPY (possibly I made some mistake), and on the Elliott-Halberstam conjecture (a big assumption!) the above is positive, which gives another proof of Chen's theorem (this one conditional). One nice feature of the GGPY sieve is that it is compatible with the kind of conditions you describe. For example, let $\chi_2$ be the characteristic function of $E_2$ numbers whose prime factors are both 1 mod 4, or split completely in your favorite Galois extension, or some other appropriate condition. (See the GGPY paper as well as a followup which I wrote.) Then the machinery still works. You just multiply the contribution from the $E_2$ numbers by a fourth. In fact you can do better and only sieve on integers $n$ congruent to 1 mod 4, in which case you only have to divide by a half. According to my napkin calculation, this is numerically not enough, the series is asymptotically slightly negative, and so this argument fails to prove your assertion, even on EH. So perhaps your question really is "difficult" in the way suggested by the parity problem. But this at least shows you how you can hope to prove statements related to what you asked for.
