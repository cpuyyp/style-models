The teaching of English started in the early 19th century due to British incursions, particularly the Phaeton Incident (French studies started at the same time, due to Russian incursions as French was the language of the Russian upper class who attempted to contact and trade with Japan). Initially, the Dutch interpreters in Nagasaki tried to learn from a few Dutch merchants who had some English, but this was not entirely successful. Shipwrecked sailors were the next best source of English, although the extent of this teaching source is not known. The most famous of these 'teachers' was Ranald MacDonald who taught for around 6 moths in 1849. He had a very positive experience in Japan according to his testimony to the US congress at a later date. Serious widespread English studies started in the 1870s when individual regional lords were competing for influence in the new era promulgated in 1868. When domains were abolished in 1973, the new central government took control and English education initially reduced and then increased when it was chosen over German and Chinese (Mandarin) as the preferred foreign language after the Imperial rescript on education was promulgated in the late 1880s. From this time onwards English has been the preferred foreign language in education although other languages are also taught, including Mandarin, Korean, French, German and, in specialist schools, other languages from around the world. In 1989 it was stipulated that English should be taught for communicative purpose, although no measures were taken to achieve this aim. In 2003 the government took major measures to retrain English teachers and reform the curriculum, which appears to have had some success. In 2013, it was stipulated that all English lessons should be taught in English in state run schools. There has been little research done on whether this has been implemented or not. 

A stele was found in the area of ancient Moab from the 12th century B.C. during Pharaoh Rameses II's domination of Canaan, which depicts a local ruler flanked by two (possibly Egyptian) gods, and the stele is made in imitation of the Egyptian style. 

When was the first recorded use of a printing press in Muslim lands? (Note: I am not asking what the first Islamic book printed on a printing press was, given that it might very well have been from a printing press operating in Europe. I want to know about actual adoption of the printing press in Muslim lands.) What is the oldest known Islamic work of art composed on canvas? 

It may be taken for granted now that Islamic countries use both, but since they appear to be exclusively European innovations at that time of the Renaissance Islamic adoption of it must have been taken from them at some later time. Islamic art was of course prolific at that time, but I've never heard of Islamic use of canvas during the Middle Ages, for example. Also, although I am especially interested to know the answer to those questions specifically in instances outside of the European continent, in terms of spread of influence I have to wonder if the Muslim held portions of Spain during the Renaissance Era were perhaps the earliest adopters of those technologies for printing and art. Can anyone provide at least a rough guess for when those two things first appeared in the Muslim world, even if we do not know the actual earliest instances precisely? 

Without you narrowing down your inquiry further though it is tough to know what specific areas to hit upon. However, those topics about Socrates, the Suda, and later Byzantine Greek scholarship were the first things to come to mind when I read the OP. Perhaps this will be of some assistance. 

Korea had a Yangban class which might be compared with samurai status but was closer to the Chinese scholarly ruling class. Most historians hold that the scholar class achieved power in China (or Chinese dynasties of whatever race, except perhaps the Mongol Yuan one) while the warrior class gained power in Japan. During the late 17th, 18th and early 19th centuries, this warrior class became a scholarly administrative class, or at the lower level a parasite class who lived off peasants' labour through small stipends from their clan lords. A few clans, notably, Satsuma, allowed samurai to also engage in horticulture, but they were the exception rather than the rule. 

I have no idea whether the offer is true or not, but it runs true to the Showa Emperor's beliefs. There is a fair amount of evidence that he was not a supporter of the militarist bent taken during the 30s and only accepted the war as a fait accompli. Japan entered the war of the 30s and 40s mainly due to fanatic junior officers taking the law in to their own hands in 'the name of the Emperor'. The Emperor himself sadly could not comment on the actions because 1) his voice was too holy to be heard (how convenient) and 2) during his stay at Buckingham Palace at a guest of George IV in 1921 he is said to have become a devotee of constitutional monarchy in the British style. i.e. he believed he could not interfere in the 'democratic' process. Interestingly, Japan was the only belligerent in WWII to not suspend elections, therefore preserving the appearance of democracy on the outside. This is a very plausible situation as the Japanese monarchy was very Anglophile at the time and Hirohito is quoted as saying his stay in Britain was the happiest time of his life.
