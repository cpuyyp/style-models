For the idea you propose, it doesn't really matter which of these we consider, or whether we consider some other model for the number and structure of the epochs, so long as there are at least three epochs — one for the older brother to be born in, one for the younger brother to be born in, and one for the present day. Times are given by ordered pairs (E,t), where (E,t) < (E',t') if either E < E', or E = E' and t < t'. (In the latter case, the difference in time between the events is t' − t; but in the former case, the first event precedes the second by an infinite duration goverened by the difference between the epochs.) Hypothetically, the father doesn't have to be "born" in any epoch, unless there are things which are meant to be older than him — even something finitely older than him would imply that there was at least one moment in time in which the father didn't exist, and that moment has to belong to an epoch under this model of time. So, just having three epochs would suffice, although there could be more. On causality in infinite stretches of time As to cause and effect, there is a reasonable question as to how an event in one epoch affects events infinitely further in time. The very existence of these infinitely old creatures across the epochs is one example of that: the father, for instance, may reasonably be construed as causing (among other things) his own continued existence. The notion of time that I've put forward doesn't give any description of what a continuous sort of causality would look like which ties together the epochs; perhaps if these infinitely aged creatures went into a sort of dormant state, and then awoke in another epcoh, you could simply define the continuity of their existence in terms of convergent states of their behaviour agreeing with each other going into the infinite future of one epoch and the infinite past of another. This implicitly invokes a notion of topology both on the timeline stretching across epochs, but also on the behaviours of the creatures. For instance, we probably demand some serious stability of these infinitely aged creatures if we want to prevent the argument that the creatures in one epoch were swapped out with a different set of infinitely aged creatures in another epoch. As to how to treat causality of these infinitely aged creatures on their presumably less permanent environment, it's hard to say. If the infinitely old creatures are the only fixed points of the world, so that everything about them is subject to change, then it is only meaningful if we suppose that there are meaningful features of the world as a whole in one epoch which arose as a result of the behaviour of the old ones in a previous epoch. 

So we can see just by calculation that they are logically equivalent propositions, or "constraints". Does P ⊃ Q mean that there's a cause-and-effect relationship? Something that trips up a lot of people is thinking about logical conditional statements as though they were cause-and-effect relationships. While cause-and-effect is one kind of conditional statement, it is not the only kind; so you should be careful not to assume that a logical "if-then" statement is saying anything about cause and effect. For instance, you might worry about conditional statements such as 

One could say that the Halting Problem indicates that unpacking the implications of logical propositions is in principle only simple if you are lucky enough that the proposition itself is one with a simple structure. In any logical framework which is sufficiently complicated to be interesting, the fact of what the logical consequences are may not even exist, from a constructivist point of view. The Halting Problem indicates that clever reasoning, using an understanding of the big picture and insight into the structure of a logical situation, some times is not enough. There is an infinite hierarchy of logical problems having subtler and subtler structure, receding to a horizon of problems which can scarcely be said to have structure at all; and so to resolve those problems, there exist no time-saving techniques — to find the answers, there is no recourse but brute force computation. If you believe that the world is modeled well enough by logic that you're tempted to say that the world "seems logical", it follows that there are likely to be an infinite hierarchy of physical phenomena of increasing complexity, to the point where there will be incomprehensible phenomena about which we can scarcely form any intelligent ideas; where in the end the only thing there is to do is to watch them unfold with time. 

may be described as "any [thing] which is a Scottish person eats their porridge plain", or "for any [thing] x: if x is a Scottish person, then x eats their porridge plain", which we can render as 

Your strategy, in the game, would obviously depend on whether you think such a predictor is possible, and honest. If you don't, you should take both boxes; if you do believe in the predictor, you shouldn't. If you believe in the predictor but get an empty box, that's tough: you were wrong either about it's ability to predict (if you go away empty-handed) or its intent to act in good faith (if you intended to take only one box but take both after re-evaluating your relationship with the predictor). However, the premise of the puzzle disallows this contingency. You may not believe that the game can be realised in fact, but the premise of the question is that the predictor is both perfect at prediction and honest. And in this case, any doubt of the player is a matter only of not knowing, or accepting, that premise. If you accept the premise of the question, it's obvious how you ought to act. The only question, then, is whether you accept the premise of the question! If you don't, then it's not that Newcomb's paradox is unsolvable: it's that you refuse to regard it as worthy of serious consideration. And that's bound up with issues of philosophical naturalism (computational complexity in particular), and psychology. 

One must be careful of what qualities one thinks of as being subject to a continuity constraint, or else one obtains Zeno-like paradoxes. Is the transition from "nothing" to "something" necessarily discontinuous? Physically realistic or no, I can certainly imagine a vacuum slowly producing a continuous substance (i.e. not composed of atoms) starting at some time T, so that as one considers times arbitrarily soon after T one finds arbitrarily little of the substance. Thus the amount of the continuous matter itself varies continuously with time. There are two criticisms that I can think of concerning this. One is that it violates modern ideas about physics (which is of course atomistic), and the second is that even in this case there is a transition from "nothingness" to "something" at time T which is not affected by the fact that there is initially very little of that "something". I address these as follows. 

What objections are there to suicide in general, and how do they apply under the Many Worlds Interpretation? Case #2 here hints at the importance of this question. An inescapable fact of suicide is that someone dies, and that this affects those who knew the dead. If you are the one committing suicide, you might not care about the consequences, or — in circumstances where you are moved to suicide by intolerable physical or mental distress rather than a bizarre get-rich quick scheme — you may decide that the consequences are acceptable. But others, your friends, family, and other social entanglements, must cope with the social trauma caused by your death, and in particular the social ramifications of choosing to die in such a scheme. If you are in great pain, they might themselves find it a relief that you can find release, if they are able to understand things in that way. But as a pact with nearly a thousand strangers, on the premise that you will only experience worlds where you get rich? Suicide causes a social injury to the people left behind, who in all branches of the wave-function must cope with the needless deaths of 999 people. Furthermore, anyone who may be directly affected is only spared this burden in 1/1000 of the amplitude of the wave function. The fact that the deaths are all of greedy solopsists may not prove much consolation to those who know better sides of them. Is suicide without duress, less irresponsible if taken up at random, as in a perfectly "fair" game of Russian Roulette? Even if we weight the moral barrier by the probabilities involved, a 99.9% chance of a terrible act is hardly less than the terrible act, for the people left behind. But a final, practical concern — the details of the execution of such a suicide pact may be crucial. One should take care that it is impossible to learn how the gamble pays off before getting killed. The ideal is for the random process which determines who lives and who dies to be a purified quantum mechanical process, such as the decay of a radioactive nucleus, which triggers a lethal mechanism so reliably and immediately that you have no room for conscious experiences between the period before the gamble, and after you have "won". This is the only way to try to ensure that your consciousness does not blunder into the branch of the wave-function in which you have lost. This is presumed to be important, because if once you have experienced a world in which you will not live, that copy of you will experience being killed. Indeed, as we do not understand how consciousness works, we cannot guarantee that you will only experience victory, rather than death. I have played the lottery a few times, and never experienced winning the lottery. I presume that this is not due to a mechanism to kill me if I would otherwise have won. The versions of me who have won, would presumably exist just as readily, and without any marked improvement of their circumstances, if I had been killed by a quantum catastrophe just before the results of the lottery arose in the branches where I would lose. Why should that version of me rejoice, that there are metaphorical graveyards filled with versions of me less lucky than him? And why should I suppose, if I take up quantum Russian roulette, that I will experience something rather than nothing — when I don't know why I experience anything to begin with, nor my somewhat atypical (turn of the 21st century Canadian-born) life in particular? A concern for social responsibilities will halt a believer in the Many Worlds Interpretation just as easily as it will halt a non-believer; and for those less certain about social responsibilities, a reflection on just how little we understand the cause of conscious experience should also give them pause. 

— Saint Augustine of Hippo, Confessions Brief remarks on medical facts and limited historical speculation As a supplement, I'll just remark that it appears that the "folklore" about hymens — that is, the common ideas which permeate non-medical professionals — is not exactly accurate. In particular the hymen does not cover the entire vagina (which would prevent women from menstruating), and in grown women is an elastic membrane which is not necessarily damaged in any substantial way with sexual intercourse (and may of course be damaged in other ways). See for instance the Wikipedia page on the hymen. Of course, the idea that there could be some quite patchy medical knowledge which might inform societal values is not surprising, and we cannot expect ancient cultures to have had enough detachment (or female empowerment enough) to think about calmly about exploring such topics. The very fact that women have often not been systematically given any substantial room to direct their own lives, that women were (ahem) an object of interest for many generations of men who had substantial political power, and the very foggy notions that ancient, medieval, and even colonial western societies have had about reproduction in general (let alone the special case of the anatomy of female genitalia), went some way to permit all sorts of ungrounded ideas about "purity" and ways that "purity" might be indicated to gain currency, when it can be quite well argued that it was both (a) purely a conceptual invention except inasmuch as it was inversely correlated with the woman's experience of the world; and (b) physically accurate only to the extent that the women whose virginity was so highly prized, may not yet have actually been sexually mature. An apology Surely someone who is not a complete dilettante in philosophy, let alone gender studies, can write a more comprehensive answer than this. I would be happier if someone with a stronger background could make this answer quite obsolete. 

I have a similar, but somewhat different, answer to quen_tin — To the best of our knowledge, no piece of mathematics, nor theory of phenomena, can ever prove to you that you are not the only sapient being. Mathematics are just symbols, and if you're inclined to doubt the existence of other intelligent beings, then you should be doubtful of any interpretation you have been taught to impose on those symbols — though no interpretation of those symbols that I know of have anything to say on the subject. Quantum mechanics is no more special than Newtonian mechanics in this respect. A lot of emphasis is put on "observers" in popular and elementary presentations of quantum mechanics, but there is no reason to believe that a tape recorder is any different from a human as regards "observation". What is it that is important about a so-called 'observer', to you? Reacting to physical occurances? But that is something that all matter does; only the reaction of some matter is more predictable than others. Is it that they have some inherent special property, such as a soul? But quantum mechanics — being a theory of physics — has no room nor patience for distinctions such as essences and accidents: properties of all things — yourself included — are emergent from dynamics, and beneath this is nothing more than motion and the void. Of course, the dynamics are so absurdly complex that to consider calculating what those reactions might be is a ridiculous conceit, but the point remains — if you take QM seriously, you should accept that you are a mode of a standing wave, as is everything else that you perceive. Nor should this seem to you to be more nihilistic than if you were an animated piece of clay, as the old tales have it, albeit subject to the laws of physics: either way, you are a piece of matter which is acting as matter will act, however elaborate the action. No matter what laws of physics you acknowledge, you are drawn to Descartes' question: is everything you see really just a cleverly constructed illusion, designed to fool you into assuming things which are false? What is important to you about the notion of 'observer' in this case? Discarding the conceit of extracting metaphysics from quantum mechanics, perhaps you are really asking whether you have peers. Are you in some fundamental sense alone? 

Syllogistic reasoning is therefore a special case of quantificational logic; it is a framework in which one can confidently reason syllogistically, without being limited only to syllogisms. But one should not feel absolutely restricted to using quantificational logic, or any particular logic; it suffices to use some logic which is both effective and reliable for coming to usable conclusions. 

We can do something similar for universal quantification. For instance, if we want to talk about things which are true for all Scots, we can do this by making a statement which is true of any object x, if x is a Scot. For instance, 

Undoubtedly yes, particularly in the case of Einstein's work. His famed Gedankenexperiments, and the logical consequences thereof, are the subject of this work of art; his prose is the execution — which are the more excellent because they don't involve heavy mathematics; his use of simple algebra to tackle the subject of what we call special relativity is routinely extolled by physics educators, and amounts to an appraisal of artistic technique used to convey an important subject. That the subject is important intellectually and instrumentally rather than grasping at human emotion directly is, to me, beside the point. Furthermore, as an afficionado of clear communication, I would rate the clarity of the prose as nearly matching Bertrand Russell, another great mathematician and (quite independently but more importantly in this case) explicator, whose prose is a pleasure to read because he makes approaching subtle distinctions nearly effortless through his precise but flowing style. I am less directly familiar with Newton's Principia as a body of text, and perhaps a modern appraisal would find it wanting somewhat in style; as medieval artists today might be criticized anachronistically for their lack of use of perspective (for realistic geometric representation, not only being unavailable to them, was perhaps not their intent either). Newton uses a lot more argumentation using Euclidean axiomatic constructions than any modern approach would ever use; but of course, Newton invented most of the tools we would use today to convey the subject, and was secretive enough not to use them in his own treatise on natural philosophy. We might construe Newton's work as an exercise in constraint as a body of art treating its proper subject, but it is a body of art that would be extremely challenging to most who tried to appreciate it. But these are the works of masters, and besides are mostly full of prose. You probably mean to ask whether we are meant to interpret the formal symbolic treatment of the mathematics as poetry. Calling it "poetry" is a bit much, perhaps; but it does get across that I mean a style of writing which is in sharp distinction from representing anything like normal speech. Indeed, writing a piece of mathematics involves a lot of precise repetitive acts and carefully judged movements in particular directions, so that if one must describe an analogue to mathematics in another creative field, it would be perhaps more appropriate to compare it to dancing, and in particular ballet. Certainly I am struck by the extent to which a mathematical development can be graceful and flows smoothly — or clumsily fails to do so. If mathematics is an art, is it a representational art? Absolutely, yes. Even the most abstract mathematics is grasping at notions of relationships and structure; extremely technical formulations of ideas that perhaps only a philosopher would love, except in those cases that physicists or other scientists discover them in their subject. Or, of course, a brilliant artist such as M.C. Escher, who without mathematical training intuited tilings of the hyperbolic plane in such works as Angels and Demons:
