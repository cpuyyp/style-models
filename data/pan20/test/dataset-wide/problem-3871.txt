Hitchin's paper was written shorly after Mirror Symmetry is T-duality and it is a matematical explanation of the paper. Essentially Maclean proved that the moduli space of sL submanifolds is unobstructed and its tangent space is the space of harmonic 1-forms on the sL submanifold. A natural metric which you can put on the moduli space is the $L^2$ metric on harmonic forms. When the sL submanifold is a torus, the moduli space also has an "affine structure". This was already known from integrable systems, they are called action coordinates. They are affine because they are defined up to affine transformations (with linear part having integral coefficients). Hitchin shows that with respect to these coordinates the metric can be expressed as the Hessian of a function. Hitchin also shows that the moduli space has two affine strutures (this is because of the "special" condition). The two affine structures are related by Legendre transform using the Hessian (i.e.the metric). So one could say that mirror symmetry is "Legendre transform". Things have developed a lot since Hitchin's paper, and M. Gross surveys these developements. How to do "quantum corrections" to the metric is a major open problem, there are many approaches. They seem all quite difficult.... Auroux in the paper mentioned above deals with it. I heard a talk of Fukaya where he wants do do it with Floer homology for families, but I do not know much about it. Then there is the program of Kontsevich and Soibelmann, using rigid analytic geometry and the Gross-Siebert program. It seems that quantum corrections could be understood in terms of "tropical geometry" in the moduli space of SL tori (an "affine manifold with sigularities"). In a recent paper of M. Gross ("Mirror symmetry for $\mathbb{P}^{2}$ and tropical geometry"), he explains how "period calculations" can be understood in terms of tropical geometry (at least for $\mathbb{P}^{2}$). Here you can find a link to a book of M. Gross where he explains the connection between tropical geometry and mirror symmetry. 

Since B-fields are being discussed in the other question, i'll try to answer your question on the complexified Kahler moduli. The set of Kahler classes of a Kahler manifold is an open cone in $H^{1,1}(X, C) \cap H^2(X, R)$. There are results on the structure of this cone which roughly say that it is rational polyhedral away from some set (I think!). In the construction of the complexified Kahler cone you have to take a "framing" of this cone, in the end you get something isomorphic to $(\Delta^{\ast})^{h^{1,1}}$, where $\Delta^*$ is the punctured disc in $C$. This matches the moduli of complex structures of the mirror, near a large complex structure limit point. These things are discussed in the book "Calabi-Yau manifolds and related geometries", by Gross, Huybrechts and Joyce. 

I think I have one: consider a torus in $\mathbb{R}^{3}$ embedded as a surface of rotation, e.g. rotate a circle of radius $1$ in the zy plane with center $(0,2,0)$ around the $z$ axis. Now put a small sphere with center $(0,2,0)$ and radius $\epsilon$. Then the map $T \rightarrow S^{2}$ given by projection towards the center of the sphere should give an isomorphism in $H^{2}$ (since the degree is 1) but it is obviously not surjective in $H^{1}$ 

I do not know of a reference, but maybe the problem can be reduced to studying the problem on the sphere $S^2$ and on the torus $T$ and then looking for solutions with certain symmetries. For instance, if $f$ is a function on $RP^2$ then it comes from a function $g$ on $S^2$ such that $g(p) = g(-p)$. Solve $\nabla^{2} u = f$ on $S^2$, then I think that $u' = (u(p) + u(-p))/2$ is a solution of your problem on $RP^2$. 

A discrete version of curvature may help highschool students. Take a polyhedron in $R^3$ and define the curvature at a vertex $v$ by $2 \pi K(v) = 2 \pi - \theta_1 - \ldots - \theta_k$, where $\theta_j$ is the angle at $v$ of the j-th 2-face containing $v$. This gives a measure of how sharp that vertex is. For simplicity, assume there are only three faces meeting at $v$. Let the normal vectors to the faces be $n_1$, $n_2$, $n_3$. They are the corners of a geodesic triangle on the sphere, which is an analog of the region spanned by the Gauss map on a surface. By spherical geometry we have that the area of this triangle is $A = \beta_1 + \beta_2 + \beta_3 - \pi$, where $\beta_j$'s are the angles. One then shows that $\beta_j = \pi - \theta_j$, so we have the nice formula $ A = 2 \pi K(v)$. I think that similarily one can argue with parallel transport (see comment by pasquale below). I have not tried the computation, but it should work. Also the global Gauss-Bonnet theorem holds: if you sum the curvature of the vertices on a closed polyhedron the result is the Euler charcteristic (I think this was orginally proved by Descartes, but I'm not sure). 

I think you can use wedge products. Choose $v \in V_1$, then $u \in V_2$, which is linearly independent. Map the flag to $([v], [v \wedge u]) \in (CP^{2})^2$. This should be well defined and holomorphic. 

A toy model for mirror symmetry is the following. Consider a real manifold (not necessarily compact) $B$ with an atlas of affine coordinates, i.e. such that the change of coordinate maps are of the type $x \mapsto Mx + b$ where $M$ and $b$ are constant. Then the tangent bundle $TB$ has natural complex coordinates given by $z = x +i y$, where $y$ are coordinates on the fibre. If further one assumes that $\det M = 1$ then $TM$ also has a nowhere vanishing holomorphic $n$-form. On the other hand $T^*B$ has it's usual simplectic structure. So $TB$ and $T^*B$ can be thought of being mirror. One can also twist the complex structure on $TB$ with a B-field. One can go a bit further too, in fact suppose $\gamma$ in $B$ is a affine curve (i.e. a straight line in affine coordinates). Then one can lift $\gamma$ to a Lagrangian submanifold $L_{\gamma}$ of $T^*B$ by adding the anhilator of $\gamma'(t)$ in the fibre at $\gamma(t)$. On the other hand the same curve lifts to a complex object in $TB$ by adding the line generated by $\gamma'$ inside the fibre $T_{\gamma} B$. If the affine structure is also integral (i.e. $M$ and $b$ have integral coefficients), then one can also partially compactify by taking latices $\Lambda \subset TB$ and its dual $\Lambda^'$ and then form torus bundles $X = TB / \Lambda$ and $X^* = T^*B / \Lambda^'$. This picture is too simple to work in the compact case, but it is expected that actual mirror symmetry is a perturbation of this. What I just described is the SYZ approach to mirror symmetry. 

I tried a computation, I hope it's correct. I considered the map h = Re $z^p$ + Re $w^p$ on the sphere, and I found four sets of critical points: (1) ($\mu_{1}^{+} / \sqrt{2}$, $\mu_{2}^{+} / \sqrt{2}$), (2) ($\mu_{1}^{-}/ \sqrt{2}$, $\mu_{2}^{-} / \sqrt{2}$), (3) ($\mu_{1}^{+}$, 0) and (0, $\mu_{2}^{+}$), (4) ($\mu_{1}^{-}$, 0) and (0, $\mu_{2}^{-}$), where $\mu_{j}^+$ denotes a p-root of 1 and $\mu_{j}^-$ denotes a p-root of -1. The first set gives maxima (where h = 2), the second set gives minima (h=-2) and the other two give index 1 and 2 points (I think). The first and second set contribute to p points in the lens space, the other two contribute 2 points each. Perhaps doing Morse homology as Pietro suggested counting connecting flow lines gives you the correct result.... but I have not tried. 

I think that $F(n)$ with a Kahler form such that the base $\mathbb{P}^1$ has area 2 and the fibre has area 1, is symplectomorphic to $F(n+2)$ with the Kahler form such that base and fibre have area 1. There is a "visual proof" of this which uses an idea of Leung and Symington (in an article called "Almost toric manifolds", on the arxiv). The operation is called "nodal trade", and is pictured below. Figure A) is the image of the moment map of the toric variety $F(n)$. You can perturb the moment map to another Lagrangian fibration, so to replace a "corner" with a singular Lagrangian fibre (a pinched torus) over the red cross in figure B). Then you can slide this fibre along the dashed straight line until it hits the opposite edge and becomes another "corner". This gives figure C) which is the polytope of $F(n+2)$. Leung and Symington explain these operations carefully in the above paper. alt text $URL$ 

If you consider a frame of your bundle E, say $E_1$...$E_k$ then there will be forms $\omega_{jk}$ such that $$ \nabla E_j = \omega_{jk} E_k$$ (summation over repeated indices). The notation $\nabla_X E_j$ becomes $\omega_{jk}(X) E_k$. So for instance $$\nabla_X \nabla_Y (E_j) = X(\omega_{jk}(Y))E_k + \omega_{jk}(Y)\omega_{kl}(X) E_l $$ where I have applyied the rules you mentioned. On the other hand $$\nabla \circ \nabla (E_j) = \nabla(\omega_{jk} E_k) =d\omega_{jk}E_k - \omega_{jk}\wedge (\nabla E_k) = (d\omega_{jl} - \omega_{jk} \wedge \omega_{kl}) E_l, $$ (again applying the rules). Now you can apply the above two forms to vectors X and Y. You will need the formula $$ d\omega_{jl}(X,Y) = X(\omega_{jl}(Y)) - Y(\omega_{jl}(X)) - \omega_{jl}([X,Y]), $$ this is how the $\nabla_{[X,Y]}$ part comes out in the curvature. By applying all these ideas in the end you get the "usual" formula for the curvature. Reference: a good book on this is "From calculus to cohomology" by Madsen and Tornehave.
