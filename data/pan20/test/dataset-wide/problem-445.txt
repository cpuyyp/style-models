The simple answer is that it can't. The only way that something like Melange would work is if it was far more complex than a simple molecule. Maybe symbiotic bacteria or viruses within the plant that are also able to act on mammalian systems once ingested. 

I think your intuition is correct. For the most part electronics are designed for function, not to look pretty. The aliens may well use different measurements, units, signs. They may have different electrical standards (so a USB plug would be totally different for example) but the core components themselves when you get right down to transistors, capacitors and wires, would all be very recognizable. Due to the difference in units and interfaces using earth and alien electronics together would be tricky, but even so it would be possible. 

So as long as the station was sufficiently large humans would see very few effects and would quickly acclimatise. 

Eggs don't split. Identical twins happen when one egg is fertilized then part way through gestation it splits into two. Non-identical twins happen when the mother releases two eggs at once and both are fertilized by different sperm. However the situation you are asking for is possible, however very unlikely. There are documented cases of it happening: $URL$ The most likely cause is that something happens after the egg splits to cause one twin to mirror but not the other. 

The scariest threat is the unknown one. He should use his gunpowder and whatever other technology he has in a demonstration to envoys of the empire and then offer them a deal that allows them to save face without needing to invade them - and without showing what the limitations of the weapons may be. For example set up a cliff face with demolition charges, bring them along, wave your hands around, say some magic words, blow the cliff. Say "this is what we do to mountains that get in our way". Don't tell them anything about the weeks it told you to set up the charges, how long it took to work, etc. Make up some mystic woojoo and also tell them that it only works within a certain range of your kingdom. This will make them see it as a serious deterrent but without being scared you will use it to attack them. Maybe use some simple chinese lanterns to fly lights into the sky, show off a few other flashy things and hint that you have access to more. 

The way I'd do it is Photoshop, if you don't have access to that you could achieve the same with Gimp although the Photoshop tools would make it easier. Get aerial photos that cover the types of terrains and climates you need (i.e. mountains, forest, beach, wood, etc). Overlay them on top of each other and then airbrush away parts of the layers. So mountain layer on top, delete everything not mountains. Then forest layer, delete everything not forest, etc until you get down to the final layer which is the ocean. You can also use "content-aware fill" to fill in any missing details on your island as well. For good results you'll also need an airbrush that is capable of sensing a range of pressure values and a fair amount of practice. 

The simplest way is just to have rockets not work or be inefficient. Anything else already doesn't work in space as there is no air to push against. So gunpowder for example is very diesel/steampunk ish and actually doesn't have great energy density. Some gunpowder rockets strapped to a ship may be able to give it a temporary burst of speed but you'd rapidly run out of gunpowder. Restrict access to high explosives or advanced rocket fuels and you're fine. 

Use hexagonal rooms to pack them together nicely and then internally plaster/etc the corners into smooth curves so that you end up with rooms with no corners. The amount of space you loose smoothing out the corners depends on just how curved they have to be to allow them. You can probably run cables and suchlike through the space they leave though. 

Redundant organs The ability to function without certain organs for a while as the organ repairs itself (or just in a last frenzied burst/monologue before they die if that's your intention). Thick hide, bone, scales, fur, etc shielding the organs. 

Essentially you need to lay a trap for them in this situation. Present a temptation, whether that's money, sex, drugs or rock and roll...something that you know the person will want. Unfortunately for you it depends on just how dedicated and smart the infiltrator is. If they keep the eye on the big prize then they will not succumb to the smaller traps. However most people are rarely perfect and will tend to slip up given the chance to do so. Be aware though that most of your non-infiltrators are also non-perfect humans. So faced with exactly the same test they may well also fail! 

The simplest way to build this would be to create the ring to have a similar density to the air, this would then automatically stabalise it as if it sinks down density around it would increase and push it back out again. You could then increase that stability by using the fact that air in different places is flowing at different speeds and the ring is not. Place ailerons, wings, or even sails on the surface of the machine and fairly basic automated control would be able to hold it in place. You have a bigger problem though which is the massive amount of air you are sucking into and out of the ring in order to process it. That would effectively place massive engines all the way around the ring pulling it through the atmosphere. That would need to be factored into any design of the ring. Honestly I know it doesn't have the same "coolness" impact factor as a ring circling a gas giant but you may be better off using an autonomous swarm approach. Just release millions of small ships that float around gathering resources and then hand the results off to collectors that then hand it off to bigger collectors etc. This is much easier to scale and avoids the problem of keeping the ring coherent. 

There is a lot of momentum in a ship, and even worse if the hull gets breached then water pours in and the ship is going down. In other words basically no speed is safe to collide, although obviously the slower you are going the less dangerous it is. Remember that waves will be lifting you up and down against whatever you hit and smashing you into it even after you have stopped. This is why boats have fenders. So they wouldn't lose masts (at least immediately) but even at slow speeds they are likely to smash open a large hole. Once a hole is formed the boat will only force itself further and harder onto the rocks as well since it is losing buoyancy and still being forced by the waves. 

The simplest way to achieve this is just have the planet in orbit around a cooler (redder) star than our sun. You can adjust the orbit to still be in the habitable band and the incoming red light would color the whole sky that way. The next best solution would probably to have much less water and a lot of iron oxide on the planet. Vast arid areas would cause dust to be picked up in the wind and colour the entire sky. This would clear sometimes and at other times be a full-on sandstorm. 

You would need a reason why the raw strength of men is more useful in the villages than out on the hunt. I'd suggest that you can use the tree-living nature of your people to achieve that. Men stay in the village to haul heavy loads up and down trees, build new tree houses, and generally do the heavy lifting. In the meantime groups of women and younger (teenage) males go out in hunting parties along routes that would not take the weight of the men. They use nets dropped from above and spears, bows, or possibly even blow darts to hunt their prey. In this way agility and lightweight are values in hunters over strength, while raw strength is still needed in the village. (Particularly if they haven't developed the block and tackle so everything has to be done using raw strength and hauling on ropes with no leverage advantage). 

With our current technology level it's highly unlikely that any substantial transfer of materials would take place due to the exorbitant cost of lifting them into and out of the relevant gravity wells of the two planets. Very small high value objects might be worth transporting but in general the cost would not be worthwhile. There would need to be some sort of massive breakthrough in launch efficiency (for example construction of a space elevator) to make this viable. However what could well happen is the exchange of information and ideas. TV shows, entertainment, music, the internet would all be transmitted. Scientific ideas and patents might be recognised or traded between the two planets, etc. These could and would happen now and bring value to both planets. Information transfer would be both easier and more valuable than any sort of physical trade for a very long time. It's impossible to predict how long as making travel cheap enough would need some sort of quantum leap in technology that is hard to predict. 

So this is a genetically engineered combat beast? It seems like they would have something considerably faster at their disposal than a sewing kit. Instead imagine they have a long line of barbed spines along the outside of their forelimbs. In combat they use these as weapons, slashing and stabbing with them. They are designed to break off and regrow and are barbed in order to stay inside the poor victim. They also have a secondary purpose though. If a dragon is injured they drive the spines through their own flesh. then pull them back so the barbs pull the wound closed. They then break off the spines leaving them in place holding the wound closed. The entire process takes seconds and is done by reflex if injured and the dragon can reach its own wound, or to aid each other. 

If they've watched the sort of films you're talking about then the only possible answer is that they make it breathe fire. It would probably glow and make a strange sound first (cos that's what happens in films) then open its mouth and fire would spew out. Beyond that if they want it to complete its mission then small arms are no threat. It would need radiation detectors to detect nuclear land mines and some sort of medium range interceptor missiles that can be used both to take out the land mines and any incoming nukes. Beyond that it's fine. It will rampage around as a virtually unstoppable self-repairing killing machine. P.S. Note that something like this forming would most likely get noticed, even in Antarctica. That thing is big. 

What you are describing is theoretically possible. There would probably be robots in a mix of different sizes involved but they would land on a planet and begin harvesting local resources to make more of themselves. They would then seed the planet with basic life-forms adapted to the local environment, produce and launch many more versions of themselves, and then self destruct. They would not be programmed with all possible forms of life (that would be impossible as the numbers are vast). Instead they would have procedural generation routines that are able to construct a basic life-form for the local conditions (think single celled organisms) and then release them to seed the planet with life. Be aware that this sort of viral replication gets complicated if these seeders start running into each other and into already seeded planets. Particularly if there is a replication error and the objectives for the seeders starts to change. 

There is a flaw in your reasoning here. You assume that there has to be an evolutionary advantage for something to happen. In many cases though so long as there isn't a disadvantage then something that does no harm can easily exist. For example human hair comes in a wide range of styles and colours because none of them has a significant advantage over any other so natural variance comes into play. So long as green skin is just as effective as some other colour (or maybe it's selected for because potential mates think it looks good in which case it just has to not be too much of a drawback) then it's just natural variance. 

Guns have no defenses against magic and lots of fiddly little moving parts. This means that you could have it trivial for the heroes to disable the enemy guns with a simple spell or ability. Snipers are harder but defenses could still be put in place. For example being able to detect hostile intent/an attack even without needing to see the attacker.
