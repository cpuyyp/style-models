I haven't calculated this one exactly, but $h(C)$ appears to be slightly bigger than $8$. Note that for each $n$ there is an increasing sequence $d_n<d_{n_1}<d_{n_2}<\cdots$ because for each extremal constellation $C$, we can imagine an additional concentric circle, sufficiently big, and add a number of disks centered on it such that each of the separating lines of $C$ is intersected by one of them. But I think that $\{d_n\}$ is bounded overall, and it even seems like $d_n$ cannot exceed $8$ very much. So: 

As $n$ grows, there are so many degrees of freedom that heuristically, rigid O-circuits of length $n$ should be extremely scarce. For example, even $(xy)^kz (XY)^kZ$, which might seem a good candidate at first glance, is not rigid for $k\ge2$ (it satisfies condition 3, taking the first and the first as the black parts). Or what about ? I imagine that for the latter, if one seizes the corresponding metal construction at two well-chosen opposite vertices, it might be possible to 'twist' it, but I have no idea how to prove or disprove that (other than by manipulating a physical object). 

This is inspired by this problem about randomly broken sticks that can form a triangle. It goes in a different direction than this generalization about randomly broken sticks that can form a tetrahedron. Choose a point $P$ at random inside the unit disk. Choose two directions at random and cut the disk in four parts by the two segments through $P$ in these directions. 

It seems to me like such polynomials are very rare, at least for degree $>4$. I conjecture that cyclotomic polynomials $\Phi_n(x^k)$, as long as they are irreducible, are uniformly splitting. Given that the constant term must be $\pm1$, it seems reasonable to expect most if not all uniformly splitting polynomials to be symmetric (in the sense of having self-mirrored coefficients). Then all factors of a (uniform) split for a given $p$ look somewhat like "conjugates" of each other, in a yet-to-define broader way obviously involving the primitive elements of $\mathbb F_{p}$. Might Galois theory be of any help here? And: 

I couldn't resist... A different construction, which is "irreducible" also for odd $n$ unlike the construction of Ace of Base, is already implied by the very first example the OP gives. (Did you find it by computer and didn't notice?) Look at the differences of the numerators... It can be straight away generalized to $$\boxed{\sin\left(\dfrac{\pi}{2^{n+1}+2} \right)\prod\limits_{k=1}^{n-1}\sin\left(\dfrac{2^n+2^k+1}{2^{n+1}+2}\pi \right)=\dfrac1{2^n}}.$$ Sure enough, denoting $\sin\left(\dfrac{k\pi}{2^{n+1}+2}\right)$ and $\cos\left(\dfrac{k\pi}{2^{n+1}+2}\right)$ by $s_k$ and $c_k$ respectively, we have $$LHS=s_1\prod\limits_{k=1}^{n-1}c_{2^k} =\frac1{2c_1}s_2\prod\limits_{k=1}^{n-1}c_{2^k} =\frac1{4c_1}s_4\prod\limits_{k=2}^{n-1}c_{2^k} =\cdots=\frac{s_{2^{n}}}{2^nc_1}=\frac1{2^n}.$$ 

So for all $x$ in a neighborhood of zero, by subtracting columns we find that the 2-vectors $(B-A)x$ and $(C-A)x$ are linearly dependent, i.e. scalar multiples of each other. Suppose $(B-A)x=\lambda(C-A)x$ and $(B-A)y=\mu(C-A)y$ for an $y$ in the same neighborhood such that $x-y$ is also in the same neighborhood. Subtracting both, we find $\lambda =\mu$ and thus $(B-A)=\lambda(C-A)$, i.e. the set $\{A,B,C\}$ is linearly dependent. I do not yet see how this argument can be extended directly to bigger matrices, like e.g. $$M(x)=\left(\begin{array}{cccc}Ax&Bx&Cx&Dx\\1&1&1&1\end{array}\right)$$ with $3\times3$ matrices $A,B,C,D$ and $x\in\mathbb R^3$, but it seems to look rather straightforward. 

I am only interested in regular graphs here and guess anyway that the higher the "symmetry" of $G$, the smaller $\ell(G)$ and $sc(G)$. The idea is in fact inspired by the construction mentioned here. I am probably not the first person thinking about that, so I'll ask first what is known about $\ell(G)$. In particular: 

The Wolfram functions collection contains a small number of integrals of products and quotients of terms $\Gamma(a_i\pm t)$ over a vertical line, all of which can be evaluated in terms of only gamma functions. Does somebody know references concerning formulae of this type? If they are obtained by the residue theorem, how? The second one seems to be false. By putting $2b=a-c+1$, we would get from it, after using the doubling formula, $$\int_{\gamma-i\infty}^{\gamma+i\infty}\Gamma(a+t)\Gamma(c-t)dt=2\pi i\cdot2^{a+c}{\Gamma(a+c)},$$ whereas for $a,c\in\mathbb Z$ such that $a+c\ge1$, we have $$\int\limits_{\gamma-i\infty}^{\gamma+i\infty}\Gamma(a+t)\Gamma(c-t)dt=\pi i\int\limits_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{\overbrace{(1-a-t)\cdots(c-1-t)}^{(a+c-1)\ {terms}}}{\cosh \pi t}dt=\pi i\int\limits_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{\Gamma(c-t)\; dt}{\Gamma(1-a-t)\cosh \pi t}$$ which may be written in umbral form as $(1-a-\frac E2)\cdots(c-1-\frac E2)$, i.e. as a linear combination of terms $\int\limits_{-\infty}^{\infty}\dfrac{t^{k}dt}{\cosh \pi t}=\dfrac{E_k}{2^k}$, where the $E_k$ are the (absolute) Euler numbers, thus it can definitely not be written in terms of $\Gamma(a+c)$ etc. Some others of the Wolfram identities look like they could be generalized, e.g. the first and third one. Is it true e.g. that for $n\ge3$, $$\int_{\gamma-i\infty}^{\gamma+i\infty}\prod\limits_{j=1}^n\Bigl(\Gamma(a_j+t)\Gamma(b_j-t)\Bigr)dt=2\pi i\frac{\prod_j\prod_k\Gamma(a_j+b_k)}{\Gamma(\sum a_j+\sum b_j)^{n-1}}$$ where all products and sums run from $1$ to $n$? (Note that again, this does not hold for $n=1$.) 

I have excluded the self-complementary groups, i.e. the groups for which $\langle a\rangle=\langle N-a\rangle $, because for those, we already know that $g(a,N)$ is algebraic by the reflection formula. Likewise I have excluded subgroups whose members form essentially an arithmetic sequence (more precisely, a set $\{\lambda s+t\}\cap \mathbb Z_N^*$ for given $s,t$), as those can be handled by the multiplication formula and yield again algebraic products. Call the remaining subgroups and the associated gamma products non-trivial. A systematic search (with reasonably high numerical precision) shows that of the non-trivial algebraic gamma products, most are of the form $q^{u/v}$ with integers $u,v$. Generally, $u/v$ is positive and $q$ a prime dividing $N$. But there are exceptions like $g(24,203)=7^{-1/2}$ or $g(103,420)=(3^3\cdot5^3\cdot7)^{1/6}$. For $n\le300$, there are $106$ non-trivial algebraic gamma products, $88$ of which can be written in form $q^{u/v}$. (With $v=1$ for 36 of them.) The $18$ remaining ones occur for $N= 60,105,120,140,156,180,220,231,255,285,300$ (note that all these $N$'s have at least three prime divisors) and have minimal polynomials of degrees $2,4,6$ or $8$. The latter holds for all $N\le 1000$. Moreover so far all of them can be written with radicals, e.g. $g(103,105)=\sqrt[3]{3(1701+166\sqrt{105})}$ or $g(41,156)=2 \sqrt[4]{13}(2\sqrt{3}+\sqrt{13})$ or $g(83,120)=\sqrt{3(\sqrt{3}-1)(\sqrt{30}-5)}$. A few of these identities, e.g. the one for $g(83,120)$, can be derived by using the standard formulas (thus in the way the OP asks next to the end). But I doubt this is possible where e.g. $\sqrt{13}$ occurs. You can get more similar identities by taking the cosets of the same groups. I haven't looked systematically at them, but conjecturally, if $g(a,N)$ is algebraic, so is $g_b(a,N)$. Note that generally, $g_b(a,N)/g(a,N)$ does not seem to be algebraic. The distribution of the non trivial subgroups seems to be at least as irregular as the distribution of the primes and not even very much correlated with the structure of $\mathbb Z_N^*$. 

More generally now, for a natural $k\ge2$ consider $kn$ unit disks as above. Let $d_{k,n}$ be the smallest $h(C)$ of any constellation $C$ of $kn$ disks such that there is a separating set of $k-1$ parallel lines (i.e. each of the $k$ strips defined by them contains exactly $n$ disks). If $k_1n_1=k_2n_2$ and $k_2$ is a multiple of $k_1$, obviously $d_{k_2,n_2}\ge d_{k_1,n_1}$, and looking at $d_{2,8}=d_8$ above vs. $d_{4,4}$, I'd expect that this inequality is generally strict. The following example for $k=4,n=2$ features a regular 7-gon, has $h(C)\approx 12.5$, which I would guess is best possible, and shows that no line of a separating set needs to touch more than two disks, some may even float around $-$ yet it is tight in a sense. So for $k>2$, the search for extremal constellations is much more tricky than for $k=2$, but I think there are good reasons that again, those must have an $s$-fold symmetry. 

Let $A$ and $B$ be $n\times n$ Hermitian positive definite matrices and $k>0$ real. Then $A^k$ is well-defined and experimentally, we have $$\det(A^k+BABA^{-1})\geqslant \det(A^k+BA^{-1}BA),$$or equivalently $$\det(A^k+A^{-1}BAB)\geqslant \det(A^k+ABA^{-1}B).$$ Note that this would imply the inequality $\color{green}{\det (A^2+BAAB)\geqslant \det(A^2+ABBA)}$ found (but presumably unproved) by M. Lin, which is mentioned in a comment here. One striking fact is that $B$ (or $A$, same outcome) can be multiplied by a positive factor, which means that the inequality remains valid for any "proportionality" between the two terms of each sum. Indeed, for any $\lambda>0$, we have equivalently $$\det(A^k+\color{red}\lambda BABA^{-1})\geqslant \det(A^k+\color{red}\lambda BA^{-1}BA).$$ 

For $n=9$, there is a highly symmetric O-circuit, but I'm not at all sure it is rigid: on a rhombicuboctahedron, consider the three squares adjacent to a triangle; their 9 outer edges form an O-circuit. There should be O-circuits for $n=7$, but with little symmetry. (Note that they imply quadrilaterals of sides $1,\sqrt{2},\sqrt{2},\sqrt{2}$ in space.) Any idea about their rigidity?

Given $n\ge 2$. For a real $d>2$, consider a constellation $C$ of $2n$ disks of radius $1$ in the plane such that $h(C)$, the minimal distance between any two of their centers, is equal to $d$. Let $d_n$ be the smallest $d$ such that any such constellation is separable, i.e. that there is a line which has $n$ disks on either side of it. We'll call such lines separating lines. They may touch some disks but not intersect them. (It is easy to see that such a $d$ and thus $d_n$ exists, by using a different scaling: Choose $2n$ points as centers, start with very small disks and increase the common radius of the disks as much as possible without destroying the separability. Then rescale to radius 1.) Denote by $\mathcal C_n$ the set of all separable constellations of $2n$ unit disks. Let's call a $C\in\mathcal C_n$ tight if each separating line touches at least three of the disks. Obviously, an extremal $C\in\mathcal C_n$ (i.e. such that $h(C)=d_n$) must be tight, and so we have the equivalent definition $d_n=\max \{h(C): C\in\mathcal C_n \text{ is tight}\}$. A tight constellation must have a somewhat high degree of symmetry, presumably a $s$-fold rotational symmetry for some $s\ge3$. If there is a disk at the center (and thus $s$ odd), $C$ seems to be much "better" (i.e. closer to extremal) than if not. A trivial lower bound for $n\ge 4$ is $d_n\ge8\cos\frac\pi{4n-2}$, attained for a constellation $C$ that has one disk at the center and the others forming a regular $(2n-1)$-gon around it. For $n=2,3$, the same construction is extremal and yields $d_n=2\csc\frac\pi{4n-2}$ (note that for $n\le 3$, $h(C)$ is the circumradius of the $(2n-1)$-gon, whereas for $n\ge4$ it's its side). The image shows the $n=3$ case with $h(C)\approx 6.472$ and the $n=8$ case with $h(C)\approx 7.956$. I'd conjecture that if $2n-1$ is prime, this is best possible. So:
