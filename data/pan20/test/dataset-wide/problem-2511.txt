The second ("noble or ariya") I've not much to say about -- bits of Buddhism or doctrine are ariya by its own definition. The third ("better than others") is difficult to generalise about. I expect stream-winners have a clear view of what Buddhism is (before that it's difficult to be sure of what you're talking about). According to this answer, making comparisons is a form of "conceit", and only a stream-winner will only give rise to true conceit i.e. true comparisons. If it is not right to say so, how right or wrong is it to assume that? I think you're asking, "If it's wrong to say so is it alright to assume it?" Firstly I think that whether it's right or wrong doesn't depend on whether you say so. Still there may be circumstances (perhaps when you're working with someone, and therefore busy with something else, or not wanting to proselytise when that's not welcome) when it's inappropriate to say so. If it is wrong to say so, it may be wrong to assume it. And according to some doctrine -- e.g. Paramatthaka Sutta (SN 4.5) -- I think that views themselves, attachment to views, seeing a view as supreme, is itself a kind of fetter. Myself as a "traditional Buddhist" from Myanmar, I find it pretty disturbing to see Buddhists here having blindfolded faith in Buddhism and every act of monks and religious leaders. I guess that's so, yes. Living in the West, here, I haven't seen many monks in person, nor acting as leaders -- and I haven't seen any who seem to be misbehaving -- but I do see news, sometimes, interviews, where a monk seems to be quite hostile for example, which I find strange -- like a lot of news though that might be exceptional, news tends to report on what's scandalous rather than on what's normal, which can lead to a false (or extremist) impression. I did read a booklet called The Broken Buddha once, so I hope I don't have a false (over-idealised and blindfold) view of modern society. 

Buddhism is more or less antithetical to the doctrine of a soul (it teaches Anatta), and so "rebirth" is a more usual translation than "reincarnation", of "what the Buddha said". Then, searching for rebirth instead of reincarnation, you can find many suttas which mention "rebirth" -- for example using this search of the Access to Insight web site (on that page, click on "suttas" instead of "All results") ... that search seems to return nearly 400 suttas ... and I hope that's an answer to your question? Access to Insight hosts translations of many but not all of the suttas in the Pali canon. These sources are the "suttas" of the "Pali canon (Wikipedia)". Additionally, note too that there are more than 100 topics tagged rebirth on this site (many more than are tagged 'reincarnation'). 

The History of the Bhikkhuni Sangha by Dr. Chatsumarn Kabilsingh (as well as another like it by Dhammananda bhikkhuni) says that their presence at the first council wasn't recorded (what was recorded was the council's making Ananda apologize for introducing women into the sangha). It also says, 

The thing I concentrate on when driving is good-will and the desire to avoid hurting other people. See also for example, 

But how? I mean when someone blinded how they can realize their mistakes. And here Samana Johnan explained in his answer of my question - Does love mean crime? that it doesn't cease or conquer. I think that Andrei was answering the question, "Should I hate them?": and that the answer was, "No, you shouldn't." Samana Johann was trying to answer a question about "love". "Love" is a complicated word, which can include good-will, attachment, lust, all sorts of different meanings good and bad. Instead of "love" the verse Andrei quoted is more precise than that, it uses the word avera which means "absence of emnity/revenge/hatred/hostility" (and this sutta fragment too uses the word, averena). 

There are suttas which describe or recommend an attitude towards food (I expect there are in the vinaya too), for example from the Bhikkhuni Sutta, 

I don't know how to reconcile the timeline of that, with the Anatta-lakkhana sutta's being the second sutta. This question is discussed on pages 43 through 44 (i.e pages 2 and 3 of the PDF file) of this document: Assaji Sutta (also known as "SD 42.8" of Piya Tan's Sutta Discovery series). The bit of that that's relevevant to your question is: 

A common description of life is as "samsara": which means "wandering from one world to another". There are many published descriptions of "samsara": for example here, or here. Also, life (or "existence", or "things we've put together") is described as having three characteristics: i.e. impermanent, unsatisfying, and non-self. 

Note the other answers, which say that conjectures about the Big Bang are irrelevant to Buddhism. The "beginning" is also described (it's described as being something which cannot be discerned), in suttas, for example the Gaddula Sutta: 

You wrote, "equally disturbing real life events I unfortunately witnessed in my life", which I haven't witnessed so I'm not an expert. If you meant it literally (I hope you didn't) it could be a question for you to ask a responsible professional e.g. your medical doctor. My guess is that one component of post-traumatic stress is a kind of dukkha, i.e. thinking something like, "I wish that had not happened, that should not have happened, that was morally wrong, they were wrong, or I was wrong, or etc." One of the therapies for post-traumatic stress (as it, i.e. the therapy, is taught in non-Buddhist circles in the West) consists of training the victim to remain mindful of the present. For example, perhaps you've been attacked while you were in the shower and now you have "flash-backs" when you're showering: one form of therapy encourages you to remain conscious of this shower which is happening now, which is normal and safe and under your control (I haven't had that training/therapy myself but perhaps it means to stay conscious of your five senses e.g. what you see and hear and feel now, as an antidote or alternative to getting lost in the sixth sense of mind-ideas and memories). Perhaps the parallel between that and Buddhist meditation is clear. Another form of suffering that can afflict a victim with PTSD might be an inability to forgive the aggressor (e.g. "I hate him because he did that to me"). To deal with this kind of trauma, Buddhism might recommend metta and/or anatta (and averena, non-hatred). 

I might add that Mahayana includes relying on or benefiting from the Buddha. That's not part of the question, but I wanted to mention it because it's important. 

I think I see the practice of not "trading in meat, weapons, or poisons" as what you might call an "indirect" means of compassion and allaying suffering. It might be (or become) so easy to practice, though, that it is not "going out of one's way to give aid where possible". 

Like the referenced 37th precept, the Buddhist Monastic Code (Patimokkha Rules) also contains various references to avoiding danger, including, 

... without defining what "truth" is, thence argues that perceptions are "illusion". In a statement like ... 

An important part of Buddhist doctrine is to not identify in this way with form (nor any other skandha). Another way to phrase this is that we shouldn't become attached (nor try to become attached to) to any specific view of self (the answer to the questions which you quoted was "no", and "no", and "no"). The suttas are full of this: they mention "clinging-aggregates" in the first noble truth of first sutta; "non-self" as the subject of the second sutta; questions involving views-of-self being described as "attending inappropriately" and leading to "a thicket of views" in MN 2; "being" being identified with suffering in SN 5.10, and so on. Given that anatta is recommended for us, presumably the Buddha has perfected that practice. So in the same way that we should not have some fixed of self (and in particular shouldn't identify it with the skandhas, nor identify it with something other than the skandhas), a similar doctrine is appropriate for a view of the Tathagata (note that the "Tathagata" is a title or a description of the Buddha). So I think that's a summary, a brief explanation, of the sutta you referenced. People talk about it a lot (there are 60+ topics on this site tagged anatman, and others on the topic of "self" and "identity-view" and so on), but it's kind of fundamental, with not-self being one of the Three marks of existence. You also quoted, "when you can't pin down the Tathagata" ... for more on a similar topic I recommend Why is the Buddha described as trackless?. 

I'm not sure about phenomenology in Pali, which I think is a subject of the Abhidhamma. So far as I know, the Pali canon doesn't say that the "outer world" is more or less than some counterpart "inner world". If you read about Ayatana it says that there are "external" and "internal" sense objects, maybe without saying that one is a reflection of the other. On the other hand, "Rupa" (which I understand as meaning "forms" or "external objects") shows up among the 5 aggregates and the 12 nidanas ... in context maybe we should understand as saying that Rupa has some existence (though not "self-existence") but it's important because of its effect on our consciousness. While I'm mentioning "rupa" let me also mention "dhamma", since other answers here talk about it ... it's a word with many meanings, I think one of those meanings is that it means "idea" ... I think the Sabba Sutta implies that dhammas are perceived by the mind, in a way that's similar to (no more and no less important than) the way in which forms are perceived by the eye, etc. 

So not "adornment", like 'decoration', but rather "requisite" or "necessity" or perhaps "tool" or sine qua non. So I think it's saying, "give with the understanding that the giving is necessary for the mind" (instead of for example, "give with the hope of getting something, like 'calmness', in return"). 

How can this idea be best applied in meditation? For example, how would meditating on the causes of suffering--to arouse compassion--be achieved? My personal experience is that it doesn't work like that. For example if I'm in conflict with someone because we both want something, or want different things, you might hope that my understanding their motive would make me more compassionate. And in theory, intellectually, understanding the motives of the other person, and understanding our situation, works to some extent, sometimes ... but it's impermanent, not really stable ... because even if I understand or forgive them, I still can't get what I crave ... which fuels conflict ... ... so the more stable cessation of dukkha coincides with a cessation of my own craving, and cessation of fuelling own craving ... possibly replacing that craving with compassion ... but the generation-of-compassion alone (i.e. understanding other people's motives, without considering or reconsidering own motives such as craving) isn't enough. 

So this raises a dilemma. Continue being gentle and compassionate with loving kindness, and get eaten. Or react harshly when necessary and risk darkening ourselves. Or, is there a proper middle path? I hope this is a false dilemma. Some of the Buddhist principles that might help you to prosper (rather than "to be eaten") include: 

Have you read the Rigveda and the Upanishads? It seems to me that the Agañña Sutta is of that style: 

Buddhism does believe in "Kamma" which I suppose is a way of saying that "events and experiences are stored". 

Firstly so far as I know there is definitely wholesome and unwholesome sankappa. I say that because Right Resolve (samma sankappo) is the second of the eight path factors in the Noble Eightfold Path: 

Secondly, I don't know whether there is such a thing as wholesome cetanā. I say that because Karma is intention (cetanā), good actions lead to good rebirths, bad actions lead to bad rebirths, however I thought the goal (or a goal) was for there to be no more becoming at all: to stop karma, which I think means stopping cetanā. I admit that there are fruits (phala) defined, but still. Don't the suttas on the subject of cetanā suggest that it's best to have no cetanā at all? 

In 'pure' mathematics, the truth of an expression like depends on the definition of the addition operator and the definitions of the numbers such as and and and so on. I think these definitions are 'axiomatic'. In 'applied' mathematics e.g.when you're adding physical objects (such as apples), then the truth depends on your ability to identity "one apple" (which isn't obvious: in the real world, some apples are smaller, some are attached to the tree, some are rotting, etc.). Furthermore mathematics is something which you do (sometimes) and which you stop doing: therefore IMO it's conditioned and impermanent. 

Its western border is the Seleucid empire which appears to be where modern-day Iran is (note that Iran I think might be ethnically Persian rather than Arabian). It also includes modern-day countries like Pakistan and Afghanistan (which are Islamic but not exactly Arabic). This map is labelled "Buddhist proselytism at the time of king Ashoka (260–218 BCE)": 

When (historically) was this view introduced into scriptures? What is the evidence and/or reasoning for this view? Is this view espoused by all schools of Buddhism, or do different traditions have different views? 

Yes I'm not sure what "spiritual" means -- does it imply a mind/body or matter/spirit duality that's common in Christian tradition (heaven/earth, God/man, etc.)? Etymologically the word is 

I think it's famously difficult to identity the Buddha; for example, in the Sariputta-Kotthita Sutta 

Some of the attributes of God include "eternal" and "omni-present" ... which (i.e. "God is always present with you") is a useful attribute, when you want a friend (or when you want a father, etc.). Buddhists are taught to avoid putting their trust/faith into things (sights, senses, feelings, other people) which are impermanent, so perhaps Buddhists too develop a relationship with (i.e. an attachment to) that which is ever-present or, if there's no such thing, then they develop non-attachment. 

As a counter to the other answer, Wikipedia's article on upāya ('skillful means') describes the Parable of the burning house: 

So saṅkhārā are impermanent. Saṅkhārā are described elsewhere (e.g. Can anyone explain Sanskara / Sankara indepth?) but I think it means: 

The Buddha also made remarks about being harmless, not killing, allowing other being to live free from fear. Again I'm not aware of his saying that in an "environmental" context, but according to environmentalists, there is such a thing as being "harmful to the environment" which isn't the same as being "harmless" or "saving the environment"; and that destruction of natural habitat and indigenous wildlife is "killing". 

The key point is that I and my desire for chocolate are both here in me, not over there in a shop. The chocolate is what it is (e.g. sugary, expensive, wrapped in paper, digestible, etc.). My desire for it (which is what makes it special) is within me, is not from separate me. Also my desire for it is a property of me, not a property of the chocolate: my desire for chocolate exists because I have indulged in chocolate in the past -- it's not (or is not only) a property inherent in the chocolate. The chocolate isn't thinking, "I am desirable", the desire is yours not of the chocolate. Thinking that the object of the desire is separate is a delusion, partly because the desire is internal, and partly because it may not be a desire that you can satisfy: if you had the chocolate, would you then be satisfied? Or would you need more chocolate? Wouldn't it be more satisfying to not want chocolate? So one (of many) techniques of Buddhism would be to think, "OK, I'm thinking of chocolate. But this craving for chocolate isn't much fun. I have better things to do than crave chocolate. I don't want this craving for chocolate. This craving for chocolate is unsatisfactory. I experience distaste for this craving." And so you decide you don't like the desire. Don't want the desire. And that without the desire you also no longer want the chocolate. "Chocolate? No thanks! It isn't good for me, it doesn't do anything for me." I'm going to try to claim that this has introduced two other key Buddhist concepts: i.e. "Anicca" (the pleasure of chocolate would be transient at best), and "Anatta" (I am not a desire for chocolate). I mention this because it too is not exactly "emotionless". Seeing various desire and saying that the desire are unsatisfactory might be called 'Right view' which is the first step of "Noble eightfold path". The next step, which follows from that view, is 'Right intention' a.k.a. 'Right resolve' which includes 'renunciation'. And that, 'renunciation', finally provides a way to answer your question: which is about "avoiding attachment". It answers the question because you can use it to begin to look-up reference articles about the corresponding word, e.g. Nekkhamma on Wikipedia, or by searching for 'renunciation' on Access to Insight (press the 'Search' button), which returns many articles such as:
