You were an employee of the staffing agencies. If as part of checking your employment history a potential employer were to contact the well known company, they would be told you never worked there. This is not an unusual situation, on two occasions I have changed companies but still kept the same desk at the customer site. In the narrative you can explain that you supported a contract for company X, or government agency Y. 2013-Present 

What went wrong is that you thought you understand the calculus used to determine layoffs. When you first hear of layoff you should assume that you will directly or indirectly be hurt by them. In a direct way you can lose your job, or see a reduction in pay; in an indirect way you can be forced to change your job or work location. Everybody hopes that they are safe, but management never tells you exactly what they are trying to achieve. Are they trying to reduce the number of locations or people? Are they trying to reduce the number of people on overhead? Are they reacting to the losses in some part of their business so everybody related to that part is at risk? How they get to those goals is always a mystery. Sometimes they save or cut people based on what project they are on, other times they cut or save based on specific evaluations. It is possible to be the best person, and underpaid but still be cut; other times an overpaid under-performer will be saved. Keep in mind in large layoffs there is little you can do to avoid the axe once you are identified by their system. I have seen surprises with every layoff, including people getting notices the day after winning an award for outstanding performance. Next time be prepared to jump so that if the axe comes you are ready. 

The scope of what is checked can vary depending on what is needed by the company, position, and customer, and what is blocked by the law. It can be employment history, financial, criminal. It can take a couple of days or it can take months. They might also request non-work references. When employment checks are done, they don't care about exact dates, but they do care about months. If they discover that the dates were manipulated to hide a hole in employment history or to skip listing a very short they would be concerned. Most companies will only provide employment date, and title information for background checks. They might provide salary information for loan approvals checks. Financial checks may be required by some employers/positions. They will look into judgements and defaults because that may show lack of judgement. High levels of debt may show a motivation to steal. Criminal checks are obvious, but what would disqualify a candidate does vary by company and position. Violent crimes are bad for all positions, but reckless driving would be a concern for a position as an ambulance driver.\ advice: If you don't know a date try and determine the date, but then note your uncertainty. Be truthful when answering all questions. The investigator discovering a minor problem that you didn't note on the forms can make the situation worse. 

If the job posting includes the must have requirement that you have used a specific product, you will have an uphill battle if you only have experience in using a related product. You must include the name of the desired product in a line on your resume or cover letter or you risk having an automated system reject your application before a human even reads it. In some companies the recruiting staff knows nothing about the actual position being filled, they are applying the business rules (requirements) provided by the team that needs the position filled and the corporate requirements. Many times I have had to provide synonyms for the technologies so that nothing that might be related is missed. Because you don't have an exact match for a required technology you will have to show either a depth of knowledge on the topic or a breadth of tool experience related to the topic. You should also make it clear that on other occasions you have been a quick learner when a new tool was needed for a project. If the job positing has the software as desired instead of required, you are in much better shape. You can easily describe experience in a way to show you meet the qualification. 

If that offer from company A is in writing and has no contingencies, and there is nothing that company B could offer you that would make you not pick company A. Then cancel the interview and tell them why: tell them you have decided to accept an offer from another company. You don't need to tell them more than that. But if all the conditions outlined in the first paragraph have not been met, then the fact that you have an offer from company A doesn't stop you from interviewing with company B; or applying to company C, D and E. A few years ago I applied for several positions during the week that I had between the first offer that had contingencies and a low salary, and the eventual one I accepted that had zero contingencies and additional compensation. 

Almost all the places I have applied in the last 10 years have required the applicant to enter the information on the resume into little text boxes on the website. They did have an ingest tool try and pull the data, but in all cases I had to adjust the information because their ability to take unstructured text and make sense of it was limited. The key word scan is trying to match words or phrases to a list of phrases they have specified a important. The more you match the more likely you are to have your info read by a person. In general the formatting has no impact on the key word search as long as the system can read the document. For many positions a resume that looks great and prints clean will not influence the chance of getting a job because HR will read what is entered into the text boxes, and the first time many interviewers will see the resume in its clean printing format is when you hand it to them at the interview. Don't over think this. 

A checkered driving record shows a lack of judgement. The tickets cost you money, the increased insurance costs you money. Yet if the tickets continue it is a sign that you have judgement issues. Even without government contracts they are asking you to be responsible with their equipment. They also have to trust you to safeguard company and customer information. A thing that can trip you up is not disclosing in advance the bad information. If you don't mentioned the suspended license, it is viewed more harshly when the background check discovers it. 

The issue will be if they call your current employer and they mention the gap. You didn't just skip the company you fudged the dates to hide the employer I would just list it. Tell them what you accomplished. But if you really don't think that there is enough positives to write about don't list it but don't hide it. Be prepared to be asked about it. Know how you will respond. Don't be defensive about it. Tell them the job wasn't what you were promised, you made the best of it, and decided to return to your former employer when that opportunity presented itself. They will be concerned you could do that gain. But reassure them that due to the changes in the current company you have no intention of going back. 

Telling them now, invites them to worry about your commitment. That means that they will start thinking of you as a short timer. When a decent offer comes in then decide if you want to switch or not. That decent offer could be in a day. a month or a year. If it a perfect offer take it, if not you can reject it if the situation with your current company is good. Now would be the time to discuss your future with the company. Ask what happens in a year if the project is a success. Ask what success means. Ask if success will result in raise, promotion, or some other benefit. Though they generally won't put this in writing it will let you know what they are willing to discuss, and it will let them know that you are expecting some reward. As you move forward you can add into your calculus the promise of the reward for a job well done. 

Some companies will negotiate a higher rate of accruing vacation days for a new employee that is not in a low level position. They are aware that an employee will move from 10 to 15 to 20 days per year. They may be willing to bump you to a higher level because they know you were earning more vacation at your previous employer. They are very unlikely to move you above their max rate. Ask them when is it normal to be moved to the high vacation level. Keep in mind that they are trying to fit your salary, taxes, insurance, and other benefits plus their overhead and profits within the maximum rate they can charge customers. You might be forced to lower your hourly pay rate to keep your billing rate in a range to allow them to make a profit. Another possibility is that some companies allow you to purchase additional vacation days. They pull $x from each paycheck throughout the year. This lets you purchase 5 or 10 additional days. Others will allow you to take Leave Without Pay (LWOP). You will have to investigate how they handle benefits during a pay period where you are on LWOP for a significant amount of time. 

Does a LinkedIn bio carry more weight than a resume? One with few contacts might not be worth anything. One created just days before the application was submitted is not anymore reliable. If you provide them with a way to absolutely link you with a specific social media account, then you are opening yourself up to a source of negative info. If they were to Google a common name, and make a hiring determination based on what they found they would be making decisions on untrusted data. If they know that you are claiming this particular account, they know the negative info has been blessed or acknowledged by you. Unless they use the information on the social media account to reach out to others to give recommendations, they are still basing their evaluation on a document that you wrote. I only see the confirmed social media account as a way to eliminate candidates who have applied. Although in what seems to be a contradiction, social media accounts are used to solicit potential candidates. 

If the company collected the information in a survey then they have to have a plan for using the results of the survey. Collecting the data, and publishing the results, without using them to address issues sets the company up for failure. (Collecting the data without publishing the results is also bad). Several different levels of management need to workout a plan to address the problems. Some problems will be localized, and others widespread throughout the company. Assuming that pay is the real problem, and that improving salaries is the only way forward. You said that there is no money for raises, but you also said there are no defined plans relating profits to raises. That may be the clue. Make a plan. Publicize the plan. And then keep to the plan. Making sure that managements number one goal is getting the performance the plan expects. It is also possible that local management is not doing enough to fight for their employees. Either way the next part of the survey process is to make solid plans for improvement for all parts of the company. This may involve more surveys, focus groups, outside organizations...Ask the company what is the next step, and then ask to be part of the team working on that step.
