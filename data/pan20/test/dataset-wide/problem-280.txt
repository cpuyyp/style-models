I'm sure dozens of other things could be figured out as well, but this shows it has general uses that are fairly utilitarian. Even if these have overlap with other elements, that just helps to how that they each have viability. EDIT2: 

What exists today that satisfies the effect you're looking for: While this doesn't quite answer your question, there are bullets that do both of the things you want and are also fairly exotic: Incendiary Depleted Uranium bullets Depleted Uranium is a more dense material than what it is being fired at (in part because it is very rare with respect to Steel.) This helps it penetrate most targets very easily. Because of this penetration, it happens to then be quite effective as a carrier of Incendiary munitions* because it will deliver them to the inside of the armored thing. *Note: might be the wrong word here. If this is scaled down it can still be useful against unarmored targets provided the delay for the explosive is such that it would generally travel a couple inches before exploding. Use in other fiction works It's worth noting that (while it's all handwavium) this is what is used in Warhammer 40k essentially; and they call their Bolts "Explosive Penetrators" IIRC. What is wrong with the concept and how to fix it If you're looking for super-heating the target to soften the armor, the reason it works is because the armor is being superheated, not because the ammunition is. This tends to occur with Anti-Tank munitions; where part of the munition is designed to super-heat the tank's armor prior to the impact of the the rest of the munition, allowing it to penetrate much more easily (to the point that modern munitions on a successful hit are normally one-hit-knock-outs; "successful hit" not counting reactive armor and other technological countermeasures to this style of munition.) In your case you could end up with a weapon that fires two different munitions in rapid succession (on the assumption you need super-heating to be part of the process) one that attempts to melt the opponent's armor via some reaction or application of thermite or something; and a second that hits the target a moment later and more easily pierces it. For soft targets the first round would likely be deadly since its going to burn them severely AND cause kinetic damage, aside from whatever the effects of the second round are. For harder targets you will damage the armor on one side and release a fragmenting or bouncing projectile into their suit, almost assuredly causing terrible damage. In general, all targets that require penetration will have a fragmenting or bouncing bullet problem, and all others will get hit twice and have extreme burns on top of two applications of severe kinetic damage. 

While (as an AI professional) believe this is essentially impossible; WERE it possible I'd mention that it's possible that the AI was not "finished" when it launched off. If you created something that is running magnificently but you didn't get to really QA it for fear of being unable to reproduce the result; or it moved to fast and "escaped the network"; or any number of other reasons.. it may just be that when it "launched off" you have no idea what it's issues are. Much like Y2k was a giant nothing but we thought the world would blow up, it could be it was never conceived that it could run out of tasks, and now the consequences are unknown. You literally don't have to have this solved for your story until the end of it; in which case you'll probably already know the best ending you could do based on how your wrote the rest of it. 

Why you don't create a hive-like species? Individuals beings won't value possessions for themselves, nor themselves - something is only useful, only has value if it can help the colony or the "queen". If you think about it, bees, ants and termites are already pretty societies without the concept of ownership - at least inside their huge families. Heck, even their lives aren't something they own - their lives are tools for the colony. You may check out the borg from the Star Trek Universe. They are already pretty much what you want! 

Well... you got some stuff not quite right there. Centaurs by no means need to graze. They may be half-horse, but they are also half-humans. More than anything, they would be hunters - excellent hunters, that hunt with the extra speed from a horse and with powerful spears. Digitigrade feet are, to some extent, not that far away from high heels. If you look what some Korean dancers can do on heels, It's totally plausible to see a creature naturally evolved to walk like that. Maybe they need some extra reinforcement on their feet, but it's nothing that humans can't already do with training. It just becomes easier with evolution. Swimmers that use mermaid tails are becoming more and more common. While they are not as efficient swimmers as, let say, sharks, they are far better than regular, "legged" swimmers. Still, that's not quite right you're looking for, it seems. What I did on one my RPG settings: 

But really, you don't need much to justify your people being racists than just picturing them as human-like. We are that bad. 

This isn't our land anymore, kiddo. There was a time in the past your old grampa here would oversee all of those mining operations, from the Red Hills all the way to the Prima City. It was such a sight - all those white, shiny domes, resting on the red blessed lands of Mars. Heh, Red. Red meant money, back then, kid. Nowadays it means just death and a idiotic flag. Nothing more. Your gramps was all fine and good, riding under the sun on my trusty Palomino-II rover, keeping an eye on those robotic builders while they put down the tracks for the Red Planet Express, to the notes of "I'm working on a Railroad", a nice, old song from my youth. I don't know, it seemed somehow appropriate. But them, those dammed reddies showed up. We always thought that it would be aliens, or some sort of magic gate that would wipe us out from this planet. But no, it was the reddies. Those reddies, back from earth. They weren't happy with our claim on this rock, oh, they weren't, I'll tell you that, and they went all North Korean on us. Sent some interplanetary missiles, right down on us. They would take some time to hit Prima City, but that didn't meant we could stay, oh no. We had to leave. Weren't going to be nuked by those reds that easily, oh, no. So we had to pack up and leave. We had to scramble every single bit of tech we had to transform the Red Planet Express into this damn beast she is today. We put her on tracks, but a different type of track. Tank tracks. We buffed up her engine, we gave her a huge array of weaps and drilling tools to make sure she would be able to clear the way. We made her into this dammed beast, oh, yeah, and your grampa was there to make sure she worked just fine. I handled those nukengines as I would handle my wife, with passion and desire for my work. 'Cause, kiddo, if we weren't fast enough, we would be just bones on the red sand by now. That's how she came to be, and just a little bit of her huge, long history. She's chugging down nukefuel for sixty years now, and it's nowhere near stopping. And you'll be the one that will make sure she keeps that way, to make sure those cogs don't stop spinning and she doesn't stop cruising the red sand. We can't stop for long. We need to keep moving, to keep watch of the skies above us. 'Cause you never know when another nuke is coming, and you won't want to be sitting down when it arrives. So now she is yours to drive, kiddo. Make sure to take good care of it. I know you'll make Grampa proud. With those words, the Machinist took out his overseer pin from his jumpsuit. He held it on his hand for a moment, looking at it with eyes that almost gave out sadness. For him, it was the end of a life of dedication to the engines that kept his people and his family alive. But he wasn't able to hold back the smile that slowly crept on his lips. Well, yeah, it may be the end of his story as the Overseer for the Red Planet Express, but it wouldn't be the end of her story. She would keep rolling on the red, dusty surface of that wild planet, running away from an invisible threat that may not even exist anymore. She would rage on, keeping everyone inside her safe. Keeping his story safe. And, more than everything, giving those people inside her a reason to hope for a future when shouldn't be none. 

Radiation is a scary thing, but it's just one example you could use. I don't think scarcity of resources will work out, unless you create some mystery "Resource X" that is A) Scarce and B) needed. Iridium would do nicely if you want to use existing resources. Wikipedia lists Iridium consumption as 10 tonnes in 2010. That's not a whole lot, and if the rockets or the supplies needed it, you'd find Earth significantly lacking it. But again, you run into the issues 

You cannot use this as-is for justification for such a conflict. Compare rocket size with the size of a mountain. Now take earth's mountain ridges. Clearly we could lose a mountain, of which many rockets could be made. (Gross oversimplification, but clearly in raw tonnes of material, this is not a problem). But let's say you DO want this as a concept. There's a movie that has in Earth-orbit colony and a kind-of conflict between Earth and the Colony. That movie is Elysium. Basically, people ruined earth, and now the rich live on the colony, whilst the poor slave away on earth. 

Now, imagine if there was a faulty (by our standards!) theory that had these "magical spirits" that "conduct magic". There are 4 elements to control, and various substances are made of these four elements. Depending on how much of an element it contains, one can control it to a certain degree. Faulty theories ("The sun rotates around the earth") can halt scientific/academic progress for a long time. Add in a world where strange occurrences CAN be explained by magic, and it becomes that much harder to advance technology. Another way to halt scientific progress is if the use of magic strains the mind. If people are constantly mentally tired from doing magic (because by doing magic, a by-product that affects the brain forms in the body), they might not make discoveries as fast. 

People are lazy and will use any means that doesn't take too much effort at their disposal to do a task in a simpler manner. Academics are interested in the workings of something, and will dedicate time towards discovering how it works and how to apply this knowledge. We need to find a way to stop both of these archetypes from progressing technology. The people If magic can be shaped to one's will, then some of the hard work might be made easier through the use of magic. This leads to a less pressing need to come up with an easier method. Unless magic is expensive, it comes with the convenience of being always available. Physical, technological objects tend to lack this property. An example of this convenience would be a remote control in our world: when one doesn't have to get up to perform an action, there's no pressing need to invent. 

This is all a "maybe if" statement, though. Humans are such curious beings. Personally, I think that what you propose can't happen - there'll always be some people who will try to find out the workings of the universe, and magic will just be integrated with that. It might go at a slower progress, however. A slower rate of technological progress is also not too strange. They won't stay stuck at the middle ages, but I could see the middle ages stretching a couple thousand years. 

Allow me to make some generalizations, so that I may reduce innovative "power" by showing how these groups of people don't have a reason or don't have the means to advance research. 

If you place your colonies further away, you could argue that there is a resource (resource X) that allows fast rockets. Resource X is troublesome to excavate, polluting, rare, expensive... you name it. Imagine resource X to be of nuclear origin, but 10x all it's factors and you get something that's pretty nasty. You still need an opponent, though. If me donating you goods costs me a lot, I might just stop. What's preventing me from stopping with sending you goods? Death of a colony? Then why are the people angry? Surely they understand? The idea is workable, but you need another source of conflict. Ecological conflict on a small scale is usually people not wanting to pay for getting rid of their trash properly, so they just dump it. Maybe there's one continent responsible for the colonies and it's polluting the world with the constant rocket launches using Resource X. Background radiation levels are on the rise. Radiation chart: (For better viewing, I recommend the original on XKCD) Basically, the "daily dose" of 10 micro Sv is already increased to 50 micro Sv, and in the future it looks like it will go up to 100 micro Sv and 250 micro Sv. Now, this doesn't seem bad, but the radiation gets in the food, and the water, and slowly the whole world is poisoned.
