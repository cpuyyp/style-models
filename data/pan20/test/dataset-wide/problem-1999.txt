To help cement the above, please visit the SCRUM GUIDE . . . the guiding principles of SCRUM by those who came up with the idea. PS: For those who are not thinking this one through. As explained earlier, I was close to wrapping up my training. I was in the middle of customizing the solution for the training exercise to show that not only had I learned the inner workings of the framework, I could also customize, troubleshoot, and re-create existing controls in this new tool. And Yes, the client did pay for me to acquire all this knowledge which I have now. 

some customer requires a new project. TIM has no idea about the requirements, the feasibility or the scope of the project because of experience and background. TIM goes to one expert, who has a deep knowledge of the technology required and is able to design and see the project to completion. When the expert says "what is the project about?" TIM will systematically reply: "you are the expert, you have to tell me!" or "there is only you, you have to make this happen!". At this point the expert has two alternatives: A) accept the project, making all the work, or B) keep focusing on his current workload and push the project back declaring it as unfeasible. In case A), the expert will start talking directly to the customer and do all the work, keeping TIM informed until the project is completed. During this process TIM will provide no practical contribution other than anecdotes from LinkedIn articles. In case B) the expert will keep doing his job, but the manager will badmouth the expert as "not being a team player" and going against the best interests of the company. In case A), TIM will add a complete project to his portfolio AND he will go around saying that he successfully managed a highly qualified team for a very ambitious project. TIM gets a big bonus, the expert maybe gets some peanuts if TIM feels magnanimous. In case B), the expert will be seen negatively by the higher management, because those guys also have no technical background and can't evaluate adequately the value of the rest of the things the expert did beyond this refused project. 

Please take this F-16 and transport 500 People 2000 Miles away tonight. If you can't, that means F-16 is slow! Yeah right! That's the logic your boss is using. If transporting 500 people is so important to him, he should charter an airliner, if he refuses to do that and F-16 fails to do what he wants that doesn't make that F-16 bad. Find the most hardworking dump truck ( 10 Ton) driver ever and ask him to shift a mine load of coal (300 T) overnight in 5 runs 100 miles away otherwise you'll lose a deal; You sure will! Your boss is trying to use a Serial cable for Parallel output expectations, It's his fault his headache to deal with. If a boss is not willing to provide adequate resources to get the job done its him to blame regardless of what you're told. If the deals were so important, he should have arranged to gather enough resources to get it done. You can't go to moon on even the best helicopter in the whole world. It's his management that will cause the loss, not your work. Such a company is bound to go under, today or tomorrow, with or without you. Don't sweat. 

New job, not enough support, random people jumping messing up priorities without a proper process. Somebody called it a "learning opportunity". I am having a chat with my CEO soon. She's very well networked and funded several companies. My question is: how to best leverage this top-level interaction? Should I discuss my problems and ask for help? Should I say that everything is amazing and that I want to do even more? If I feel that my manager is blocking me, should I discuss this? I want to make the most of this, but I am afraid of stirring trouble. 

That is so so so soooo wrong! Answering a professional question that you have no clue about, without doing any research, is actually the unprofessional thing to do here. Telling someone I will research on this and get back to you is one of the most appropriate responses you can have. If I was the interviewer or even your boss and I was certain that what I asked is not everyday knowledge that you should already know, I would be pleased with your response. 

Listen to this guy. 10 years from now on you will be thinking fondly of his advice and will be regretting not paying heed. In the present you are fresh, energetic, eager to work as fast as you can but slowly you will tend to find less energy to keep up the pace over the years. There will be a day you will start thinking I can take it a little easy I don't have to do everything yesterday but by that time you would already have gained reputation for getting things done yesterday and you will have to keep the pace up even when you don't feel up to it. I don't know or care about the motives of this person for telling you to slow down, but the advice itself is very good. Send me back 15 years I would take it. 

I am a customer-facing programmer who is growing in a commercial direction. In the last 34 months I have been very successful at bringing opportunities to the company, often doing the job of the only salesperson I support. I brought millions over the years, directly responsible for several new customers in my territory. I asked to have more formal responsibilities for the territory I cover. My manager is being pressured to hand me over to some other manager. The head of sales wants me to join him as technical support. Both moves will bring more structure and lower decisional power. In other words, without commercial managers I have been doing so great on the commercial side that now commercial managers want to manage me. Meanwhile, the CEO asked me to create a full plan for the territory for next 12 months, putting together all my knowledge of the upcoming opportunities, with detailed estimates. I know I can pull this off, because I know well customers, product and market. However, there is no committment by the CEO or the company to give me a bigger role, and it's possible that even after I do this my work will be handed over to somebody else. Managers argue about giving me a more structured, smaller role; the CEO wants me to complete a major project; in either case, there is no promotion in sight, and I never had one in almost three years. My question is: should I accept a project well above my pay grade from the CEO, without rewards in sight, ignoring all other managers' requests for "surrender"? Is it realistic to expect that a big success with the CEO will override all other crap about my role? Or am I wasting my time? 

I just got laid off of a job after just 5 weeks. I have worked, and was hired as Senior Engineer working middle-ware/server-side with a bit of client-side scripting work here and there(jquery comes handy in these cases),and then given a "training exercise" to, as I assumed, help me ramp up on a client-side framework working with native JavaScript, that was new to me. So, thinking like a "Senior" programmer, I jumped into working to gain the deep understanding of client-side framework, and the various ways it worked to process my calls, so I can better tackle the task and others to follow. After about 3 weeks of working on it(company orientation meetings and all), I was about 96% through but the client decided I have spent too much time in working on it. The expectation was that I would spend at most a week on the project and ramping up - copy-pasting where I could - to get the task over with. I understand now that though I was brought on-board as a Senior engineer, I was in fact expected to first learn to work with the new library(copy-paste wherever I could), and then gain the understanding required over time, while working and pushing out code that is production ready, written in that library. There was daily communication of updates during SCRUM meetings every morning. The question here is . QUESTIONS 1) When you find yourself expected to learn new technology in a very short time, and you have not only informed your manager of your inability to complete the training in such a short period, but made sure to provide daily updates, and ensured the line of communication stayed open for anyone who had additional questions, what do you do? 2) In the scenario above, was the client's expectation (complete training exercise within a week, start churning out production-ready code by the next week) unrealistic or was it in line with an "Agile" approach to learning that I am likely unaware of or not trained in? OR 2) Was my approach, which I assumed to be in the best interest of the company, to spend at least a month ensuring I gained solid grasp of this new technology so I could produce higher quality results than those before me, wrong? 3) Given that this supposedly "agile" training approach is unfit for me, how do avoid being locked into such a commitment on future assignments? How do I stress that I require a good amount of time to learn new technologies without hurting my chances of getting the job during interviews? SCRUM <=== A.K.A Daily Update Communication Meetings 

That might serve as one of the reasons why you shouldn't try to be indispensable for any certain position at work 

Andy's picture that you have painted clearly makes me believe that if Andy had heard that conversation, you would not be sitting here guessing whether he did. You would have received a call back right there. So, don't worry :) And that is the recommended practice at least in our culture, cross the bridge when it arrives. 

Set the alarm after the regular office time is over. Everyone who stays in office after that and has to go out must disable the alarm and then set it again before leaving. Following this protocol will ensure the alarm is always set and there is no guesswork involved whether someone else is still in the building or not. Yes it is a little extra hassle for everyone to do it but it ensures its set always. Neither does it cost you an extra dime nor does it rely on guesswork. 

In both cases my work is delayed in exchange for almost no contribution, and my own boss is already aligning this project with the company's interests. My question is: how can I defend myself from all these self-invited contributors, in a professional way which will protect my best interests without damaging my career? 

What is the difference between a Business Development Manager and a Salesperson? I am interested in understanding how these two roles differ on a day-to-day basis, and how they interact with each other. EDIT: my basic knowledge would separate the two roles between "generating new leads" and "closing deals, managing current accounts". But I am trying to understand if this is correct, and how the roles interact.
