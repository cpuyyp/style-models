I would just get really riled with the coworker and tell them loud and plain that you can't work with the blind open and to damn well shut it when I come back in the room. If this doesn't work, get hold of a big mirror, preferably a fresnel lens, and point it so when s/he opens the blind,their monitor melts. This would be an interim fix until I boot management up the backside with a 'fix this before I call health and safety inspectors' warning. 

My approach to this kind of problem is to ensure there is sufficient methodology and tooling in place to make the issue technical and not personal. For example, make sure you have automated builds and smoke tests. If these get broken, have a rule that the breaker must provide food at the next team meeting. Sometimes people will just boldly challenge the status quo in a selfish quest for personal progress. In a way, this is normal. It is entrepreneurial at best. The individual is moving forward in a framework that permits it. So, change the framework. Those types of people will not be thwarted, they will make progress in different ways. So as a manager your aim is to harness that spirit and direct it in a way that is positive for the team and the aims. Part of that strategy of harnessing will is to make sure people still feel a sense of ownership. The most popular answer here thus far advocates a philosophy of renunciation of ownership. I think this may be counterproductive. Let people passionately own their area. But make sure they do not trespass others'. 

In Central Europe in IT it is expected that you join on a lower salary and undergo a trial period. In IT this can easily be 12 month, especially for a junior. To then expect a rise is normal. There is no logical implication that this would imply an annual rise. Since the financial crisis CPI inflation rarely has any effect on salary. The contrary. Since the crisis, the biggest effect on salaried employee living costs is consumer debt interest rates which have dropped annually. CPI inflation is much lower than asset price inflation. 

Do exactly as you wish. If you want a job where you can yawn when tired and dress as you wish, keep being exactly as you are, without compromise. If you feel you were unfairly treated, then screw them. You win. You avoided being treated like a monkey later. Hey this is a short answer but in a nutshell this is all you need to know. 

I used to be part of a team of four people. One was the manager, the other three developers. The manager is/was my mentor and has always kept me under his wing, which I truly appreciate. Over the last few years the team has dissolved, primarily due to one person leaving for personal reasons (left organization) and the last team member eventually moved to another internal position. My manager became a Director but kept me as his direct employee because I'm a good problem solver and he wanted someone that he could assign to fires that he couldn't handle (a black bag man, in his words). Eventually I ended up in a windowless office (this isn't a punishment or anything, it's just lonely tbh, even though I am very involved in office events such as organizing parties and internal employee sponsored studies. The point is I'm social, but isolated at the same time) in the System Engineering area of the IS department. I have no team, and no real manager in the sense of any weekly meetings and/or directions or plans. Eventually, another Director starts "becoming" my manager. I say "becoming" because it just kind of happened, there was no official discussion or anything like that this person would be by manager, they just slowly began directing parts of my work. The problem with this is obvious - I am now getting input from two separate high level people, input which often differs in scope and direction. I have no team, I have no manager who can help and guide me. And to be perfectly honest, cute situation has been grinding me down, my work has begun to suffer in my personal opinion, but I still received good reviews and bonuses. All that brings me to my question: I ended up speaking to both Directors about how I feel. I spoke to the non-Mentor director about how I felt isolated and confused due to incoming information and without support. I admit that I was a little emotional in the sense that it was obvious the situation was really bothering me and I had to discuss it with someone who I work with frequently. After this conversation I spoke to my mentor and immediately explained that I had had this conversation with the other Director. I feel that I handled the situation incorrectly, although I was honest, calm, respectful and polite . Although I feel I have to walk softly in order to protect myself and not also start some flame war between Directors (and possible future VPs). What would have been the best way to handle something like this? Note: my organization employs 4000 people and has an HR department. One of the people in this little drama (not me) is in a relationship with the person who runs the HR department. I can also see the writing on the wall and have already begun applying for new positions, internal and external. Office politics are confusing to me and I don't want be involved, but didn't know how to handle the situation. Thanks!
