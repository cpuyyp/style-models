It also states that "You must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice." If superdb.com does this, then it does exactly what the contributors expected it to do. By doing so, the original contributors get the credit they expected from the license. Now perhaps this particular open-source database software was unaware of what their license choice meant, in which case such actions might be preying on the ignorant. But if we assume they knew what they were doing, they picked this particular license out of the dozens of similar licenses which draw the line slightly differently. There was intent to support this action. Thus, to argue that such an act is unethical is to argue that the act the contributors intended you to do is unethical. While you could argue that there are sufficient negative consequences to make it unethical, doing so with the contributors expressed intent is a difficult argument to make. You would likely have to argue that the contributor's choice of license was also unethical, because it provided too much freedom and not enough guidance. (assuming this action is actually legal. The way I read the license, it's legal, but a lawyer may know better than I) 

Now, if I want to amplify a signal using a transistor, I will build an amplifier which provides inputs within the Ohmic Region. The audio amplifier in your phone or stereo does this. The goal of such an amplifier is to maintain the characteristic of the sound by simply making it "bigger." Now, let us say there is a "lesser" input (which would correspond to the pornography of your original question) which fits nicely within this region. We actually have well understood rules for dealing with the consequences of this. By the analogy, the effect on both the viewer of pornography and the associated degradation of women fit within a region which can be simply thought of as "amplification." This tends to be thought of as a grey area in ethics: where something is considered bad, but can be balanced against other effects to determine if it is worth pushing back against, or if there are bigger fish to fry. However, a larger signal can cross a line. A "greater" input (corresponding to prostitution) may leave this region and enter the saturation region. Any signal which enters this region behaves using different rules. Because the curve is so flat in that region, it is hard to tell the difference between 5V (perhaps a minor sex-for-cash enterprise) and 15V (a major heroin-abusing prostitution cartel) simply by observing the output. In electrical engineering, this change is from amplification to "switching." In a more social analogy, it means the system must treat this as a switch - you are either on the wrong side, or the right side. The grey areas which showed up in the Ohmic region is made invisible by the logic of this saturation region. This is where we see arguments like "you are with us, or you are against us." Push further, and we reach breakdown points. At this point, all useful models start to fall apart. This is the point where you see people "putting their foot down," and allowing all sorts of atrocities in order to combat something. Most societies avoid this with prejudice, but we can see this in comic books, when a hero is told to "do whatever it takes" and goes very far down "the dark path" before arising victorious. All of this is just a model. It does not have to be a valid challenge to your position. However, it is based on a very simple model: 

Edit: responding to your comment in my answer (because that way I can use newlines): The change in wording reflects the classic logic decomposition of "P -> Q" into "NOT(P) OR Q". Limiting myself to just Actions rather than All-Things without loss of generality (so the wording is a bit easier to read): 

Is this an a priori statement, or an empirical one? I believe Kant is arguing that, unless you can prove that you have observed every woman in the universe, you cannot make any empirical statement about "all women," because you simply cannot know. You must make an a priori claim because you are assuming truth about "all women" without actually observing them. Meanwhile, Feynman is arguing that no philosopher makes an a priori statement of truth without some empirical evidence to back up their claim. It may be faint, but some how the philosopher's experience works its way into the choice to make a declaration. Which point of view you agree with depends mostly on which direction you want to take the topic. If you find that empiricism is overstepping its bounds, making claims about things it should not claim, you may side with Kant, arguing such claims are a priori. If you find that philosophers are making things up that do not match with the world view your experiences are developing, you may side with Feynman, arguing that experience is essential in any such claim. 

You can name it anything you like. I would call it "wasting time," and immediately dig in on the that was their logic. You could call it a Hasty Generalization or a False Generalization or a False Equivalence if you really wanted names. But the big issue is in how they managed to assert . The particular fallacy is really there, not in the following rambling about the consequences of . We can't name that fallacy in general because there's any number of ways to make that incorrect assertion, many of which have their own name. In reality, the only issue that arises here is that speaker B got to spend time discussing how Q is bad. This wastes time, and might bias third parties. But it's not actually the fallacy itself. The fallacy is in the logic that wasn't correct. 

Another thing to consider: perhaps there are other definitions of "true" and "false" which are more nuanced than those you use currently. Both are just words, four and five letters long respectively. It's the concepts behind those words that are so powerful. However, logic does not define True nor False. In fact, if you look at the fundamentals of mathematics, True and False are not constructed using predicate logic or anything like that. They are constructs that are defined implicitly by defining their behaviors with respect to operators (such as X OR False -> X) One utilitarian point of view would be to declare that the version of "true" you are using can never possibly be attained via empirical evidence, because there are always questions of whether we perceive what we perceive. Such a truth becomes a mathematical oddity, creating a skeptic mindset. However, if we recognize that, we can repurpose "true" to also include things where determining their truth-ness is actually more expensive (from a utilitarian POV) than the gains which one can get from knowing the answer. Why not declare something to be true when one's value is increased by such a declaration, even if one is ontologically wrong. This is certainly not the only definition of "truth" out there, but I provide it as a tool to kindle ideas for other meanings. For example, many religious individuals "count" something as true without any empirical evidence for it at all (or, in some cases, empirical evidence which cannot be described to the non-initiated). Thus one can say there are many many individuals who have other definitions of truth besides the one you are using, and you have the freedom to explore them all, if you so wish. 

The loophole needed is that the original problem is phrased in a language. In our case, the language is English. English turns out to be a really poor language for discussing bridge crossings, so we turn to the language of math. We define a translation of the original problem (in English) into a new problem, defined purely in the language of mathematics. We then do the problem in mathematics, and translate the answer back into English. Anyone is free to question whether the translation of the original problem fully captures the English version. Anyone is free to question the translation of the mathematical answer into English. In fact, this happens on a regular basis. Look up any "proofs" regarding omnipotence and omniscience and you'll see just how much people disagree on translations for these words. As for the Koenigsberg bridge problem, I would argue that you could translate the problem into a topology problem (every point in the city has "neighbors"), then use math to perfectly translate that into the graph problem.
