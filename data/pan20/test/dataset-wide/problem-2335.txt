First, if you remove the descender from the harness, you can accidently drop it down (this really happens sometimes). Second, you have one more connection, which you need to control. This can increase the risk, if you are tired and/or do a lot of descents in a row. Third, and the most important, figure 8 twists and tangles the rope like hell. It is not a problem when you need to descent 100 meters in the mountains, but it's much worse when you are descending 500 meters in a cave. 

The most obvious thing is an emergency blanket. It will add a lot of extra insulation per gram. It'a good to have one in you bag on any trip. However, a mere blanket is definitely not enough for all seasons, elevations and weather conditions. When planning at home, you should ask yourself a question: "What will happen to me if I have to be on the route overnight?" Than take this much insulation that will make the answer not worse than "no permanent injury". While at home, think of where (at which points of your route) would you sleep if something happens. Good shelter is very important, because wind and elements take a huge amount of heat from you. On top of the mountain is the worst, near a wall is better, between 3 walls (rocks) is even better, snow cave is the best (so learn how to dig one, if you are going very high up or in winter). Another lifesaver is water boiling gear (I'd recommend JetBoil), it also has a very high rate of heating per gram (compared e.g. to clothes). Of course you'll need water to boil, so know where you can find it or take some extra. 

Admittedly, my first aid training has lapsed - but the last mountain first aid course I took about 5 years ago made a point of matching the speed of onset. For example - if a person has fallen into an icy stream, they will have very rapidly cooled. You need to get their core temperature up, fast - the best way to do this is to strip them down out of their wet clothes and dry, and then, while still unclothed (this is not the time to be body shy), into a sleeping bag with someone else. However, if it is a result of long-term exposure, then you can't just rapidly heat them up (no matter how bad it may seem). If they haven't gone too far (teeth are still chattering, they're still shivering) - extra layers and, a hot, sweet drink can help. Keep them moving. If they are not shivering anymore, they're pretty much heading into hypothermic shock - at that point, get them into a sleeping bag with another warm body. You should strip outer layers, but t-shirts and shorts can be left on. If you're in a large enough group and you have to stop, send a party for help. 

I'm not sure that this is something that can be properly explained over the internet. You really need to be instructed and supervised by a real person - preferably indoors first. I have found a pretty good instructional video on YouTube, although it is quite basic - I've reviewed a few others on there, and they are unfortunately questionable in their technique. Belaying is about judgement - you need to give the climber enough slack that they are free to move up the crag, but not so much that they will fall too far if they slip. How you approach belaying will depend on whether the climber is leading or using a top-anchor. About the only thing I can state absolutely over the internet - you always need to have a grip on the rope that is trailing from your belay/friction device down to the ground. A loose hold on this will just let the rope run through your hand(s) freely in the event of a fall, given you friction burns and endangering the climber. 

There is more than one reason, which makes you feel warmer sleeping with less clothes (even if it's perfectly dry): 

(origin: commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Corda_alpinismo.jpg) This is a "last resort" type method, because it is quite hard on your body on inclined slopes and simply painful on verticals. But it works and you can even use a prusik to back it up. Because the rope presses hard on your leg and eats up your clothes by friction, people started to add more fabric to their pants at the main friction point. Then they started to sew metallic parts to their pants. Then they realized that they didn't need pants if they had metallic parts. This way the first belay devices were born. 

If I get it right, they are using the idea of hunters, who attached a deer skin (fur outside) to the ski (e.g. like this). It's called "камус" and "Steigfell", and I don't know an English word for it. Just like you can pet your cat in one direction and can't do it in the opposite direction, with Steigfell on you can easily glide in one direction (forward) and if you try to glide backwards, the fur will "bristle up". I never tried it myself, but I know a couple of people who say it really works: you can easily go uphill, without (much) affecting forward gliding performance. When skiing backcountry making your own track on snow, even "climbing" 5-10 degree slops can be very tiresome (or you use a grip wax and sacrifice gliding at all). So having a Steigfell (in your case, integrated) is a huge advantage. But don't expect to be able to walk a 30-deg slope uphill. 

In addition to great strategy advice by Kate Gregory and berry120, there are some technical points. Take a deep breath If there is no immediate health/life risk, take a deep breath and think a little. 1-5 minutes of planning beforehead will help you do important things first, and avoid doing unnecessary or dangerous things. At this time, you will decide, if you are calling 911 immediately, if you are fighting or retreating and how to fight most efficiently. Estimate the danger I'm not a fire expert, so the following classification is very rough. 

You'd be much better off doing the research before you head into the areas - print off tide tables for where you are heading to and for the period you'll be there. Tide tables should be available on your local meteorological service's website - and should include things like average range of the tide. The actual range between low and high tide is dependent on a few things, including the time of the month (greater range around full/new moons) and also the lay of the land (constrictions - like gullies in cliff faces - can experience greater tidal ranges). 

This is why I like the pouches that have a zip-lock bottom as well as a cap on the top - it makes it a lot easier to clean the inside and leave it open to let it fully dry. My friend also swore by leaving the pouch in the freezer when not in use - this would obviously slow down mould growth considerably in between uses. 

I found this PDF from UNESCO It would seem ethanol (denatured alcohol) is top of the list, but petrol is pretty good and probably more cost-effective. The both have similar densities (about 0.7 kg/l). No data on white gas, but given the chemical content of it, I shouldn't think it's too far off petrol. However, as Zoul points out in the comment below - ethanol releases its energy slower, so it isn't all that useful. Another consideration is soot - petrol can leave a fair bit of soot, and dirties up your jets. Ethanol burns a lot cleaner (denatured alcohol may soot up some more, because of the additives). Personally - I use an omni-fuel burner which could burn propane, butane, white gas, petrol and kerosene. Most of the time, I use Coleman's fuel (a type of white gas). I found one litre of that would easily last me three days of breakfasts, dinners and cups of tea. I also think ethanol burners are pretty dangerous - they're prone to being kicked over and spreading burning fuel, and the flame burns clear. Update: an alternative to liquid/gas burners are hexamine fuel blocks - they're what I used to get when in the Territorial Army, and one block will boil a pint of water and last for several minutes (great for boil-in-the-bags and leaving a water for a brew). They're pretty light-weight, and the burner is simply a foldable tin stand (saving weight from a liquid/gas burner). 

Choose patch material not weaker than original material Choose nylon thread, which is NOT stronger, than both original and new materials (otherwise it will rip the weaker material like a knife). Sew together the two materials overlapped, avoid passing thread through 1 layer of the material (see #2). Usually more stitches of thiner thread is better than few stitches of thicker one (look at your harness where this principle is demonstrated in its extreme). 

There is at least one option from Ferrino, but I am sure there are more from "mountain" brands. Maybe you should stop looking for "4 season" and start looking for extreme/mountaineering/alpinism solutions, because high mountain expeditions usually imply low temperatures and high winds. But make sure you the tent is not an "emergency" tent. However you are right, sleeping in a 1-person tent in winter is not recommended at all, at least if you have relatively little experience in winter camping. In e.g. -10 or -20 C it is still cold when you sleep tightly packed with your friends, and it is much worse when you are alone. And if you make a mistake letting yourself to get too cold, there may be no one around to help you. So in winter people in my area tend to travel in relatively big groups and (if possible) to have a log stove inside their tent, which is obviously impossible with a small tent (please don't take this as an advice to burn any kind of stove inside you tent, it is always very risky). If you still want to try, then there are some key points that you will want to check when shopping for your tent: 

Make sure the problem is in the shoes first. First, if you run on asphalt, try running on dirt trails. They are softer and provide much less shock to your joints. Second, make sure your running technic is correct. I would recommend the book from a world champion Gordon Pirie, which is very understandable by a non-professional runner. One basic idea from the book is that you should land on your toe, not on your heel. This introduces another joint to participate in shock absorbtion, distributing the force more evenly. I don't claim that this is the only right technic, but it does work. The book has advice on running shoes too, but they are quite different from what you usually hear from the adverticements. I have had the same problem too, and running on the dirt + landing on my toe (well, more on my toe, than on my heel) pushed the limit from 1 our to 2+ hours. 

As well as squeezing stress balls and pulling on fingerboards, I bought a powerball a few years ago after one of my friends lent me his. It really helps with the wrist and forearm, and if you get the RPM counter, you can have a bit of fun, too. 

You need to distill it - I'm assuming that freezing is not an option (unless you're camping in the extreme latitudes). This is easiest, as the ice on top is almost pure water. Where you don't have a freezer available - boiling the water, capturing the steam and condensing it back to water will provide pure water. 

While this is by far not a universal truth, in general, women tend to have more slender feet than men. Then again - some women have wide, plate-like feet, and some men have thin feet. Also, I've noticed that women's hill shoes tend to be 'prettier' (I'm not sure why - I doubt that this is actually a consideration for most hillwalking women - but that's just my opinion). However, as you've discovered, not all feet are equal - and not all boots. If you were to try men's boots from a different manufacture or even design, then you might not find them as comfortable. The only real way to compare the fit is to have both the men's and women's version of the same boot in the same size, and see how you go over comparable walks. 

Okay - I found that both my Langmuir (Mountaincraft and Leadership) and my Mountaineers (Mountaineering: The Freedom of the Hills) have pretty good advice about lightning. I would advise anyone planning on heading out into the hills to read both of these excellent books - Langmuir is the book for British Mountain Leader Training, and the Mountaineers covers a lot extra information for activities over in North America. I don't think being away from the treeline is particular problematic (unless you are the only thing on a very flat piece of ground). As long as you are not on the top of a ridge/hill, then there is a safe "shadow zone" on the side of the hill - I think something of the order of 2/3 of the way between the hilltop and its base. The only thing is - you should sit on top of a plastic sheet or your backpack to prevent picking up stray eddy currents from the ground. From Langmuir (Mountaincraft and Leadership, 3rd Edition): You can get a shadow from a 7m or taller cliff where the safe zone is between 3m from the base out to the height of the cliff - this means standing 5m from a 7m cliff should reduce your chance of a lightning strike (note - reduce - there is still a chance you can get hit, there is no 0%). There is a diagram on page 227 of 3rd Edition - I can't find one to link to, unfortunately. He doesn't say how steep the cliff should be, though. If you enter a cave for shelter (or dive under a boulder) - you must have at least 3m head room (so - 5m total) and 1m to either side. From The Mountaineers (Mountaineering: The Freedom of the Hills, 6th Edition): These guys are pretty clear: 

Put rubbers/galoshas (or any other huge size boots) on your ski boots. Remove the soles of your previous ski boots (or any other of your old boots with good grip) and glue them to a spare pair of NNN bindings. Click off your skis, click on your anti slip soles. Use the method of rubbers with spikes, but skip spikes. Again, you can use a part of your old boots for this. 

It's the same deal as with mittens, which are warmer than gloves. When you wear a lot of clothes, there is additional separation between the parts of your body and more exposed surface. More surface means more heat transfer from the body to the environment. And if you share a bag with someone, you get less heat from one another. What's more, your arms and legs, which produce less heat, get separated by thick clothes from your torso (and from each other). So you end up with uncomfortably (or even painfully) cold toes or arms. In winter/high altitude you are usually wearing a lot of clothes and it's quite bulky. When you get into your sleeping bag like this, some parts of your body get compressed/clamped (e.g. armpits, elbows, ...). This leads to worse blood circulation and less heat for peripherial parts of your body. 

One point besides being warm (which is a really tough task by itself), is having something to drink - it's not easy in below-freezing temperatures. You'd want to have a reliable stove or you'll be forced to share your body heat with this show filled bottle. Another option is using sun light to melt snow during the daytime: use a lens or try to heat your black sleeping mat - but this will probably work in the summer only. Having a stove and a gas cartridge is really a big deal in winter survival. Just as a good map and a compass are. I hope you are asking just to be prepared for some highly improbable emergency. If chances of this surviving-without-sleeping-bag situation are high, I would just cancel the trip - or get enough camping gear to make this not an emergency but a routine. And please don't go alone. And if you get such an emergency, it's essential to think of it as an emergency, i.e. don't try to finish he planned route, don't hesitate to call a helicopter if you have the option, don't hesitate to leave some expensive but heavy/unnecessarry gear behind, etc.
