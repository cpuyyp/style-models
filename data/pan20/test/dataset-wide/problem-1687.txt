I not sure to what you want to install both apache version on your server. It is like you want the brand new model of car and the old one too. There is no reason you can not install it but there will be a problem if they try to serve on the same port (80) as on will block the other. But if you configure them on different port it will work. Again I don't know why you want to do this. 

It's not not secure from people sniffing the network. Just think about it when user need to connect there javascript hashes their password and send them to the server. The server compares it to the database. A sniffer would only have to sniff the password and send it to the server so this is as secure as clear text password. As others said I recommend SSL/TLS tunnels to be establish to connect to your server. 

If I understood well you want to delegate the DNS from your registar to your own DNS server. So yes it is possible you just have to tell your registar to point to it. You will need to add an NS record and a A record to point to your server and server's IP address And so you'll will be the authoritative DNS server for your zone. It should look like this: registar: example.com. IN NS ns1.example.com. example.com. IN NS ns2.example.com. ns1.example.com. IN A 0.0.0.0 ;; ip of ns server is needed because it's the only way for everbody ns2.example.com. IN A 0.0.0.0 ;; to know where you are You: example.com. IN SOA ( ;;; soa blargh!! As it means Start Of Authority you are the one ) example.com. IN NS ns1.example.com. example.com. IN NS ns2.example.com. a.ramdom.host.example.com. IN A 0.0.0.0 ;; ip of a random host 

I installed the SonicWALL Global VPN Client on a MS Server 2008 R2 File and Print server, connected the client to the local SonicWALL, and then installed the local printers on the remote print server and deployed them via Group Policy. This solution will work for legacy printers until I can replace them with "cloud enabled" printers. 

I have two AD servers separated by a T1. Location A, which hosts the primary AD / DNS / Roaming Profiles server is subnet 192.168.0 Location B, which is the secondary AD server (I'm trying to configure but...) is on subnet 192.168.1 I understand this may be a DNS issue. The only DNS server I have assigned to that subnet via DHCP on a Sonicwall is the AD server in Location A. I got positive results from DNS tests in ping and nslookup. I have joined, unjoined, rejoined the domain. All Event Viewer is telling me that the login is taking too long, it took 931 second, it's taking to long to log off, and there's a csc resource cannot be loaded... Is it simply that the profile is too large in size for the T1? I've enabled Folder Redirection - still taking forever, stuck at "waiting for user profile service". Note that this happens on both Win2k8R2 and regular Windows 7 in Location B. Now happening at Location A as well... [Possibly fixed - it may just be raw profile size, even with folder redirection on] What is the best way to troubleshoot this issue? 

It seems that the return path for the packets is not known. To be sure you would need to check intermediate routes, I'll get to that in the end. When you ping 10.10.3.50 from the 10.10.2.0/24 host it is forwarded your default gateway (lets assume 10.10.2.1), then itself checks its own routing table and sees the route for 10.10.3.0/24 via 10.10.1.5. A ICMP redirect can normally be ignored since its purpose is only to shorten hops needed and router load. But it is sent because its seems that the next hop is on the same physical net as the request cames from. But what you should check is wheter or not the 10.10.3.0/24 router as a route for the source subnet 10.10.2.0/24. 

Try to see documentation about iptables there should be some config about caping bandwith. But on the other end you should try to configure iptables to ban bad IPs so it will clear the problem and also you will be able to report IPs and time of the attack to authorities. 

It seems to be an client problem why it's declining the address. Is it well configured to use a DHCP address. Try runing dhclient manually. 

As they are block these connections are not harmful for a DDOS. Logs are only there to let you know who tried to attack you. What is harmful is when the number of half connection opened gets near the limit you specified in your config. What I suggest you is to follow the advice of Zypher and have your firewall to moderate these connections. 

I was copying a VM between datastores last night when I looked away and then the vCenter host started restarting due to Windows update... The VM transfer between was aborted, but now the VMDK file it was transferring is locked and I can't start the virtual machine. The Knowledge base articles I've found are too cryptic, I just need to get the vmdk unlocked... How? vCenter / ESXi 5.0 Error: "Unable to access file [NEXSAN_SAS] rds-sv-ent/rds-sv-ent_1.vmdk since it is locked" More Details: "An unexpected error was received from the ESX host while powering on VM vm-261. Reason: Failed to lock the file. Cannot open the disk '/vmfs/volumes/4f4bb0fe-f7daabec-6a41-ac162d73a349/rds-sv-ent/rds-sv-ent_1.vmdk' or one of the snapshot disks it depends on. " 

I have a Google Chrome software install group policy object that works perfectly except when logging into the the Terminal (Remote Desktop) Services Server. It's configured under "User Configuration" in Group Policy. The group policy is linked to both my Employee OU, which contains the user account that is logging into the RDS server, and directly under the Domain, but it refuses to be acknowledged. Why? 

I'm running your standard Domain set up - AD with DNS and a RDS server. On the RDS server, I've mapped some drives to a local NAS using the DNS shortname... \\folders\sharedfolder \\folders is a static DNS entry on the AD server. "Randomly" it starts throwing the error "Windows cannot access \\folders" I can: ping folders nslookup folders (connects to local DNS server and returns the proper IP) connect by ip address \\192.168.1.111\sharefolder connect by FQDN \\folders.domain.com\sharedfolder but I cannot use \\folders\sharedfolders again until I restart the RDS server. net view \\folders = System error 53 has occured. Thing is, I restarted the server Saturday afternoon for the problem and now it's Monday morning and right back to it! 

For some reason those cmdlet are availible using the 64 bit version of powershell. It is shown as Windows PowerShell in the menu, without the trailling (x86). If it is not shown in the applications menu just search for it. You should then have access to the cmdlet for deduplication. 

Context switch are normal. A process is assigned to an quanta of time, if it finish (or it paused caused by the need of ressources) what it have to do it can let the processor go. That said to count how many context switch are done (it becomes a stackoverflow.com answers) it would take the internal kernel schedule() command to write into the processes tables. A there is no such thing if you program your own kernel you'll be able to see but it's quite difficult. 

I accidently create a "\" file into my linux how to revert it. I tried rm \ (as it's the escaping character it didn't work), rm '\' and rm \\ nothing worked. 

If you have access to the firewall inside the router, I would deny HTTP packets coming from the WAN interface. If the HTTP is accepted from the inside then with the vpn it is just a question of connecting to the vpn and then to the remote access. 

In grub legacy it uses exclusively menu.lst. In grub2 grub.cfg which you should never modify by your self. If I recall correctly there are commands called grub2-install and update-grub2 on debian that will configure grub.cfg. 

The setup: Plantronics USB CS50 Headset > USB Port of "Thin Client" (Running Win Pro) > (Wireless) RDP to Remote Desktop Server > Eyebeam Softphone Client > VOIP Server > Caller (cell phone or another in-office extension) During a live phone call, the incoming voice (From the caller played through the USB Headset on the remote client computer) is all broken up and barely intelligible. The outgoing voice recorded from the remote client computer and sent to the caller is flawless. Any other audio playback is flawless as well. For example, the caller can call and leave a voicemail on the VOIP server and then the user can play the voicemail back through the headset on the remote client and it's clear as day. Is there anything I can do to improve the audio playback sound quality during a live call? Note: I am currently using "Play on this computer" versus "Play on remote computer" as the server does not have a sound card installed. 

I had more problems even after disabling RF Monitoring, but upgrading the Sonicwall to SonicOS 5.8.0.3 (which also upgrades the Sonicpoints) seems to have alleviated the issue. 

I spun up a Remote Desktop Server instance on Amazon's Virtual Private Cloud service... What's the best/easiest way to print from the VPC to local printers? The local printers are IP based, but not "cloud printers". I'm familiar with how Cloud Printing works for Chrome, but is there a way to install a cloud printer as a regular Windows printer on a Remote Desktop Server and "just have it work?" 

I am using Windows Server 2012 R2, and after it reboots I absolutely need to connect to it in local or else it will not allow any connections (RDP, shared folders). What is the option (local or group policy) to allow connection without needing one to connect to it in person. 

An apple's airport express can do do the job as well as any other wireless router. You'll need to configure the router in a browser type: 192.168.1.1 or 192.168.0.1 and follow what you need to. 

First what would you install apt instead of having yum? And second you'll need to find a source to had to yum so it can install apt, but because the two programs (apt and yum) are doing the same job but on different platform I don't think you will find one. So I think you'll need to build apt from source (see on Source Forge). 

Normally it will be an unsigned 32 bit (on 32-bit system) so 2^32 = 4294967296. So the range is 0-4294967295. 

If you run bash yo can edit /etc/profile and /etc/bashrc. They are analog to the user ~/.profile and ~/.bashrc. So put all your common vars in /etc and user more specifc in ~/. 

What you'll have to do is use UUID of your partition instead of partition special file. If your unbuntu is recent it will use UUID by default in GRUB and /etc/fstab. 

Another option - which I actually did - was to use ImageX to write an image of the second drive to the first drive, disconnect the second drive, import the VM with the vCenter AWS import tool and then add a volume to the imported VM and use ImageX to expand the image back to the second volume. Worked flawlessly! 

I lucked out in the case. Upon writing this, the main disk was locked. I removed the VM from inventory and readded it - no good. I vMotioned the VM between hosts and noticed now the main vmdk (OS Drive) wasn't locked, but the ancillary swap drive. I disconnected that and started the VM - good to go. Powered down the VM, reattached the swap drive, 100% ok. These two sites were very helpful: $URL$ $URL$ 

I have an ESXi host with the following virtual machines: 1 x Active Directory Server 1 x Remote Desktop Services Server 1 x SQL Database Server 1 x Accounting Software Application Server I have a second "blank/empty" ESXi host. In theory, what I wanted to do was simply schedule the VMs to be cloned the second host as a backup. If something happen to the first server, I could simply boot the VMs on the second machine and resume as if the first never went down. In practice, this seems a lot less practical having done quite a few searches here on SF. My main concern is the integrity and consistency of the SQL database... This backup strategy does not seem to be recommended for SQL servers due to unwritten data residing in memory. I suppose I could shutdown the server, clone it, then reboot, but in my perfect world, I'd like to duplicate these VMs at least nightly while still live. What would be the best backup strategy for replicating these particular types of servers to a second ESXi host nightly while they are still live? Consider separate options for a budget of $1,000 and a budget of $10,000. Is there a better possible backup strategy as a whole? 

So I would check if your receiving end has any delay to fetch mail or that the server that receives the mail did not put in a long anti-spam check. I would pull out the logs from your mail server at that moment to see what happened wrong. If the header is right you should look at 2015-09-08 03:19 -0600 (your servers local time). 

You can install a RAID volume utility that will do the mirroring during runtime, but to get there you'll need to copy the entire disk (not only files but the whole disk in raw like with dd command in unix). 

The ~ means the home directory of the current user (or the user you try to connect to), but watch out adding the authorized_keys file to a user permits the one with the private key to connect to your server (without any password). 

auditd is a good utility to know what have been done to every file. It might not be what you need tough. 

The problem with well constructed rootkit is that they modify your system's command; like ps and top to not show the processes of the rootkit and ls to not show files of the rootkit. So what you'll need to do is to get these command possibly from source or in binairies form. (Be sure to be well signed). But the trick of a root kit (I've seen it) is that they maybe corrupted your compiler too. So when the compiler knows he is compiling ls or ps or any command he infectet them as well. When I saw this problem I said fine lets recompile gcc, but no what I need to have to compile gcc...the infecte gcc....so when he knows he is compiling itself he infect it so it can infect the command. You will say that this come big and difficult to detect, yes but rare are the root kit that are so bulletproof I just gave youthe worse case. Seriously, if you are sure that there is a root kit in your server, reinstall it!
