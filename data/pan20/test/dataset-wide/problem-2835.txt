I agree with the observation that the Wikipedia definitions (but really article introductions which is not quite a definition) are insufficient. I've wrestled with these issues a good bit myself, and in trying to educate other people in physics. I believe there is a notable missing piece here, which is geometry. I find that people will very often question the philosophical basis of physics, but when I challenge them to question the philosophical basis of geometry, they don't even understand what I'm talking about. In reality though, geometry was the fist in the progression of a scientific worldview. Geometry is a perquisite for physics in the truest sense. Now, let me echo something from a previous answer. 

Well this has been subject to various philosophical debates for a very long time. If you look at the definition of the two terms, you will get what seems like a circular answer. One refers to the other and the other refers back, case in point: 

The trend of the differences for duty seem to imply that some part of the social contract is responsible for it. Duty to vote can be a burden to some and liability to others (the disenfranchised vs. those seeking future political office). Calling to be a soldier, cop, doctor, journalist, humanitarian, activist, etc etc (suggesting a familial trend - my father, his father, and his father ^n was a soldier so its my calling to serve, etc). So we can say perhaps that DUTY is born out of ideology or social contract which motivates the action with a sense of implied greater purpose. Now looking at the differences for obligation seem to imply imposition of some of kind of responsibility out of legal, moral, or religious rules/laws. Obligation to obey traffic rules, caring for your offsprings, going to church, academic honor to not plagiarize or cheat, do not steal, do not kill, etc, you get the idea. We can perhaps see that obligation tends to come out of legal responsibility, moral or religious beliefs. The differences may seem subtle but they do include nuances that may be significant to how the individual behavior is guided. 

Our vision may be 2D, but just like a computer screen, the smallest detail that can be represented is limited. These days, we have a very good intuition due to computers that a higher dimensional concept can be mimicked by a lower dimensional source of information, provided that it is not represented in infinite detail. I think this allows us to break off from the false notion of perception of the "obvious" world around us, and reduces the problem to that fact, the simple observation, that we have senses. Beyond that, consistent laws can be formulated for what we see through those senses. Physics, and more specifically the mechanics you re is merely one stage in that process. 

The connection between mathematics and art goes back thousands of years. Mathematics has been used in the design of Gothic cathedrals, Rose windows, oriental rugs, mosaics and tilings. Geometric forms were fundamental to the cubists and many abstract expressionists, and award-winning sculptors have used topology as the basis for their pieces. Dutch artist M.C. Escher represented infinity, Möbius bands, tessellations, deformations, reflections, Platonic solids, spirals, symmetry, and the hyperbolic plane in his works. Mathematicians and artists continue to create stunning works in all media and to explore the visualization of mathematics--origami, computer-generated landscapes, tesselations, fractals, anamorphic art, and more. AMS One of the most commonly observed art created by mathematics is the various algorithms that organically create fractals and patterns for example. Consider Fractal Geometry. Creation of natural objects normally the subject of artwork through a mathematical formula is just as artistic: 

Kierkegaard and Nietzsche are often treated together as early existentialists. This is rather odd, as Kierkegaard was self-consciously seeking to be an orthodox Christian, and Nietzsche was self-consciously seeking to destroy Christianity. Nevertheless, after reading only a little bit of Nietzsche I have seen some parallels to Kierkegaard already. (Citations below from The Portable Nietzsche). For example: 

Terminological Background The traditional tripartite view of human nature, or the trichotomy of human persons, refers to the distinguishing of soul and spirit in humans (the body of course being the third part). In Christian theology, this is usually associated with the idea that in regeneration, the spirit is made new but not the soul. Thus "the tension between soul and spirit accounts for many of the struggles of the life of faith" (Richard Gamble, The Whole Counsel of God, Vol I, 247). The bipartite view of human nature (which Gamble argues for), or the dichotomy of human persons, is the view that there is no difference between soul and spirit. In Christian theology, this is often accompanied by interpreting πνευματικός in most of its occurrences in the New Testament as referring to the Holy Spirit of God rather than the spirit of man. I am more familiar with the bi- than the tri- view. Question Reading The Sickness Unto Death, I am trying to get my mind around Kierkegaard's understanding of human nature. It seems fairly clear that he does not equate soul and spirit; for example, on the (in)famous first page he says: 

I want to drive a little in the direction of perception, and the basis for believing that we have observed something. It is apparent to most people that we live in a 3-dimensional world, as evidenced by their senses, but the idea of 3 dimensions is a geometric concept. Geometry applies rules that demand consistency of statements regarding a real observed phenomena. That real phenomena is the apparently 3-D (+time), apparently Euclidean space that we live in. Basic Newtonian kinematics extends the tenants of geometry to motion of objects. I think that a major roadblock here is the question of "what is our perception?" If one fully accepts the tenants of geometry, then they can simply make a definition of perception that is the evolution of the geometric form of the world around them over time. If you do that, Newtonian kinematics is not lacking anything in terms of physical justification because it is demonstrated to be very well reproducible. Values such as mass and energy are not derivable from the basics of geometry although a value such as volume is. These values that arise in the formulation of physics that were not present previously can be taken as nothing more than an intermediary - something introduced in order to maintain a consistent set of laws. For this question, I think that what I've written is sufficient for the philosophical justification of physics with the assumptions I've mentioned (like acceptance of geometry), but I want to take a step back before concluding. Our perception is not exactly that of 3-D Euclidean space + time. From the moment we gain consciousness we find ourselves experiencing that geometry, but we only experience it indirectly, through other senses that are both: 

Mathematics is considered a universal language because the principles which it holds are the same no matter what. 10 of something is 10 of that thing no matter where you are, what you speak, and how you write it. This is the reason why the SETI project has been broadcasting mathematical formulas on multiple bases ensuring that the recipient will understand at least one of them if not all of them like we do. Because math is a fundamental building block foundation, any civilization or lifeform will have to have a form of it. This means that at that level, they will have math and can communicate back to establish a cipher for bilateral communication. They can choose base number system 2 binary (how computers communicate) 3 ternary 4 quaternary 5 quinary 6 senary 7 septenary 8 octal 9 nonary 10 decimal (how we commonly refer to real numbers) 11 undenary 12 duodecimal 16 hexadecimal (again commonly used in programming and computer hardware) 20 vigesimal (Aztecs and Mayans used this for planetary positions) 60 sexagesimal (used by the Babylonians and still used to measure time) and even if they use one that is not here, when we send them the same value on all of these bases, they can use it to calculate what it would be on their math base and send it back allowing us to figure out the base and establish a key. This is absolutely critical in foundation of language and basic communication with unknown languages, similar to the techniques used to decipher hieroglyphs, ancient Persian tablets and so on. This is how we decipher dead languages on our planet, so it will be applied to any new intelligence in the universe and if they are intelligent enough to be communicating with us or even receiving us, then they have reached a development stage allowing them to comprehend and adapt. Now that being said, given that math and geometry are steps toward understanding elements of physics, they would have come to the same conclusions as we have over the years. They may have come to them at different order, with different level of specificity and by different names, but the principles of the physical universe would be observed. Now barring a silicone based lifeform able to live on the surface of a red giant and breath sulfur, we can safely assume the same rules of physical universe would apply to them as well. 

This bears similarity to Kierkegaard's idea of "in despair not wanting to be oneself" (Anti-Climacus in The Sickness Unto Death). Also: 

Once again, Kierkegaard speaks much of spirit and consciousness of spirit/self. Wikipedia claims that Nietzsche said he would read Kierkegaard. Do we know whether he actually did? If not, can their commonalities be traced back to some other philosopher they both read? For example, perhaps "consciousness of spirit" is terminology from Hegel? 

Nevertheless, it also seems to me that this is significantly different than the traditional tripartite view of man; he does not seem to conceptualize spirit as one of three components of man, but the relation of the two components. How does Kierkegaard's position compare to standard bipartite and tripartite views of human nature? 

I have been a hacker and programmer since I was 14 and I have done advanced education and research in Artificial Intelligence. We all know that we do not yet have a computer entity that is "truly" intelligent since all have to conform to their coding and logic proposed by the programmer(s) therefore limited by the scope of those instructions. However, let's assume for the sake of argument that one of those machines becomes sentient, like humans. It thinks for itself, by itself and without any reliance on programmatic logic. It would be considered a new lifeform; albeit created by man. Here is my question: If god has made us in his own image and therefore is God because he created us, does that also mean that if we as humans create a sentient lifeform from say Artificial Intelligence, would we be considered it's God? I ask because if the premise for God is that he/she/it created us, then by all standards we would be God as we have created a sentient being. So in essence, we are to it as god is to us, right? 

When interpreting any author, it is crucial to understand his terms. Reading The Book on Adler (sometimes titled Concerning Authority and Revelation), I have come to understand that the essentially Christian (which I take to be equivalent to "the essence of Christianity") is a key phrase for Kierkegaard. But what does he mean by this? In which of his books does he discuss what this means? Many people have different opinions on what is the essence of Christianity is, so I cannot assume that Kierkegaard means by this what I would envision by it. Here is an example use of the phrase in context (The Book on Adler, ed. and tr. Hong & Hong, 116): 

So simply put, mathematics can indeed be art as well as the foundation for beauty, symmetry and organizational foundation of building or drawing in general. 

Now you can see that in a way they are being defined interchangeably. However it seems that what separates the two are a matter of perspective and understanding of its context. Ironically what brings more light to this difference are the synonyms. Observe that while some of the synonyms are the same, given the way they are defined not a real surprise, there are key differences in there that if they were truly the same would not happen. The primary differences are:
