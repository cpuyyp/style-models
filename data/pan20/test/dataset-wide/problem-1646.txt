There are studies that has shown a link between what you eat and how likely you are to get a girl or a boy. The difference is very small though, and "sour" doesn't seem to be relevant. The only food item they studied that had an effect seemed to have been cereal. $URL$ Another study looked at the amount of calcium, magnesium, sodium and potassium ingested, and the authors advise that a woman who wants to conceive a boy should eat foods high in sodium and potassium for a girl, she should eat foods high in calcium and magnesium: $URL$ However, they seem to have been claiming this since the early 80's without anyone else corroborating this. (When scanning the net, I also encountered claims that making the body more alkaline, including eating a lot of lemons would produce a boy. :-) ) 

Germany changed their laws in 2002, making prostitution equal to any job, so you have to pay taxes and get social security etc. There is no indication this increased the amount of trafficking. But then again prostitution was semi-legal already before 2002. Ref: $URL$ Sweden criminalized prostitution in 1999. One of the stated arguments was lowering trafficking. Unfortunately there was no statistics available before 2003 (see above ref), so we don't know if it has increased or decreased. So there is no data to say either way. 

And this is still two separate questions, but I'll make an attempt to answer one of them. Or maybe a half. Namely "did Muhammad have sex with Aisha when she was nine years old". And the answer to that is as far as we can ascertain, a big question mark. We simply don't know. The sources on Aisha is the Hadith, which are texts collected about Muhammad about a 100 or 200 years after his death. We don't know how accurate they are, but they are generally seen to be quite trustworthy, but they are at best second-hand accounts. These sources (1, 2, 3, 4,) agree on that Muhammad and Aisha was engaged when she was 6 years old. But they can be separated according to who is the original source. Many of them attribute themselves to Aisha herself. She consistently says that she moved into Muhammad's household at the age of 9. No quote attributed to her says that the marriage was consummated at that (or any other) time. Other quotes do say that is was consummated when she was nine. But the question then is how they know? Reasonably only Muhammad and Aisha knew. And the question also arises to what "consummated" means. In western tradition the marriage is consummated when you have intercourse. I can't find any source that says what word is used in the Arabic originals, so I don't know if the implications are the same. Also, Aisha never had any children. But she used her position as Muhammads wife to wield power after his death, claiming to be his favorite wife in some of the quotes above. With her youth combined with the fact that she had no children, it might have been that people claimed that their marriage had never been consummated in an effort to minimize her influence. In that case of course other trustworthy people would have to step up and say that it was consummated. And since the culture at this time had no qualms about marriages to children, they didn't claim that it was consummated when she was 18 (at which point Muhammad was dying anyway) but more realistically that it was consummated when she joined Muhammad's household. And today people then go "Ugh, child molester!" as a result. But in the end, the only sources we have are third-hand sources saying that the marriage was consummated when she was nine, although we don't know exactly what that means, and we can't be sure what happened, because only Aisha and Muhammad knew for sure, and they didn't say. 

There is no evidence that any superatural claims have any sort of validity. This includes all forms of magic. Reference: $URL$ 

Yes, you can be naturally better at it. People with Aspergers are often highly logical and intelligent and good at computers. Aspergers is over-represented in computing, and generally accepted as being just a sort of computer-nerdery turned up to 11. The people with Aspergers are better at maths and computers than people in general, and there is little doubt genetics are involved in Aspergers. Hence it is clear that genetics can cause you to be so disposed that you have a easier time for the types of formal logical thinking that computers and maths require. Aspergers is also not a on/off disorder, but a spectrum where everyone ends up somewhere on the spectrum. At one end there are people who are autistic, and on the other end people who have very high social IQ's. So how good you are at maths or computers are at least partially determined by your genetics. Math skills has also been shown to be heritable in many studies: 

First of all, the rise in any particular cause of death requires that this cause of death is generally accepted as a cause of death by those who write the death certificates. Most of the rise in SIDS that came as you notice in the wake of vaccinations, come because terms like crib death and SIDS didn't exist before, and became gradually more accepted during this time. Causes of death are subject to trends and fashions too. (ref) So why does this arise after vaccines? Well, the rise of crib death does not come from a rise in babies suddenly dying for unknown causes, it comes from a decline in babies dying. Child mortality had declined from 400 in 1000 to 3-8 in 1000 in the rich countries since 1800. Yes, 200 years ago, 2 of every 5 kids would die before they reached 5 years of age. That children died was so normal that nobody outside the immediate family would really take much notice. And the amount of reasons were so many and so badly understood that nobody would be surprised that a child died for no apparent reason. And much of this decline came about because of vaccines! Still in the 50's 30 out of every 1000 children would die before 5 in the USA, four times as many as now. The result is that now, thanks to better hygiene and general vaccinations it is now very unusual when babies die. And parents nowadays want to know why their baby died. 200 years ago, there was no why. It was gods decision. He picked 2 out of 5, and that was that. But now both parents and doctors get frustrated when they can't find out why, because that means that can't prevent it in the future. So since the 50's when there is no obvious cause, you start noting that there is no obvious cause, and hence you get a rise in unexplained SIDS / cot death /crib death, up until it's general acceptance of the condition in the 1970's. Since the mid 80's the rate has been sinking, as the problems causing this are getting better understood, and recommendations to not smoke and put the baby on it's back has taken hold. That sinking rate could not have happened if vaccines was the problem.
