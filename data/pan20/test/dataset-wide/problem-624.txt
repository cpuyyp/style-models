Note that even if you get a derailleur on using the chain tug with derailleur hanger, you still need: 

The preferred way to do this is to use something like JP Weigle Framesaver. This is an aerosol so you're more likely to get the product in more places which should be protected. And it will dry much quicker (though it has been known to make seat posts somewhat prone to slipping). However, companies like Surly still state boiled linseed oil and motor fogging oil are acceptable ways to protect the inside of the frame from rusting. John Allen also discusses a product called Boeshield T9. You're only saving about 5 bucks probably by using boiled linseed oil, so I don't see the point in preferring it unless you already have it / have some problems with aerosols. 

For those who aren't familiar, a SRAM Automatix hub is a 2-sped internal gear hub which shifts automatically, with the shift mechanism and everything contained in the hub. The mechanism is mechanical, and there aren't any batteries or anything involved. So, no cables to the back of the bike needed except for a brake cable if you have a freewheel Automatix (rim brake), disc brake Automatix or roller brake automatix. The coaster brake variant will not need a brake cable, obviously. There are in some sense similar products from Sturmy Archer (Sturmy Archer Kickback, which you backpedal a bit to shift), but the Automatix is the leader of the pack since shifts automatically without any user intervention. While Automatix hubs are pretty reliable and work well, they aren't very popular in the grand scheme of bicycles. And whats available is highly market dependent. You're primarily going to find automatix on things marketed as city bikes or something similar. Major manufacturers like Specialized have had them in the past, but you might end up having to go with a more boutique manufacturer (e.g. Mission Cycles). Your bike shop should be able to help you. The swapping in of an automatix wheel is straightforward but not necessarily trivial; you have to sort out your rear brake situation (coaster, disc or roller in the hub, or have the hub freewheel and use a rim brake), have the right hub spacing for your frame and an appropriate rim size. I'd say its not significantly easier than getting a bike with automatix in the first place. 

Mudguards can be measured in a few different ways, so different brands may vary. And it seems the SKS model numbers and names have recently changed, so some websites may still refer to the old names. For SKS Chromoplastic, 'P35' refers to the width of the mudguard. For it to fit, the guard has to be a bit wider than the tyre, probably at least 5mm more. From the SKS website, the Chromoplastic 35mm is designed to fit a 700 x 20-28 tyre. So for a 40mm tyre, you should look for a 50mm mudguard. Or a bit wider if your tyre is particularly wide or knobbly. SKS do make a Chromoplastic P50 (also known as 'Hybrid' size), designed for 38-45mm tyres, so that would fit fine. Or another option would be the SKS Bluemel B53, which is 53mm wide so fits 700 x 38-47 tyres. 

Shimano Deore XT T8000 is a groupset designed for trekking, touring and commuting bicycles. It is different to the XT for mountain bikes (currently XT M8000). So some bike shops may not sell the whole range of trekking components. 

Mars Bars are not that great for cycling. Yes, they have quite a lot of calories, so will give you some energy. But most of that is simple sugars, so it may be a quick energy boost, but soon followed by an energy crash. Also Mars Bars have quite a lot of fat (about 17g per 100g), so this can not be easily digested while cycling hard - it could just make you sick. Mars Bars are not very practical either. On a warm day, a bar in your back pocket will probably melt, so become rather messy and difficult to eat. 

Much of this is due to UCI regulations. They specify what shape and size of frame can be used. It is not allowed to add extra parts just for improving aerodynamics. See the UCI document Technical Regulations For Bicycles - A Practical Guide To Implementation (PDF) which covers most of this. As it says for Article 1.3.020, the frame elements must be tubular, with a maximum transverse dimension of 8 cm and a minimum transverse dimension of 2.5 cm, in a maximum ratio of 1:3. Also Article 1.3.024 "Protective screens, aerodynamic shapes, fairings or any other device that is added or forms part of the structure, and that is destined or has the effect of reducing wind resistance, are prohibited." It could be possible to make a more aerodynamic bike that was not allowed by the UCI. But you would be restricted by what races it could be ridden in. A few brands have mode non-UCI compliant race bikes, mostly designed for triathlon. eg some versions of the Specialized Transition or Shiv, which have extra aerodynamic tubes etc. 

Drive trains make some noise. The rear derailleur has little wheels which turn and the ability to vibrate a bit (these noises can increase with age of derailleur, or if you've damaged it by hitting it) while the chain sometimes rubs on the front derailleur. The chain can make some noise if its not running perfectly aligned. Bent chainrings can also cause some noise. Badly rusted chains can also be noisy (especially if they skip due to rust). If you cross-chain, such as using the big front chainring with the big rear cog or the small front chainring with the smallest rear cog, the chain runs at an extreme angle and likely there will be some noise at least from the front derailleur since the chain will likely rub (you can "trim" the front derailleur for some adjustment with friction shifters). This is by design -- the derailleurs have an operating point which is good (e.g. when not cross chaining) and when you deviate from it, you get some noise. Other sources of noise in the drivetrain can be in the bottom bracket or the hub/wheels. In short, don't run absurd combinations except for service (small front/small back being one), and make sure your derailleurs are properly adjusted. See this link for rear derailleur adjustment (also hanger alignment if you've crashed) and this one for front derailleur adjustment. From what it sounds like, you're having issues when cross-chaining, and in this case, noise is normal. 

Running 23 mm tires on a rim width of 23 mm is insane -- your tires should be around to 40-50 mm. To summarize Sheldon Brown's page: Narrow tire on wide rim = pinch flats + damage from road hazards (which is the case you are in) Wide tire on narrow rim = sidewall damage + rim failure and bad handling You need to get a narrower rim for the bike (or possibly do a 650b conversion if possible, so you can run decent sized tires). 

You've really got a few things going here. For going up hills easier, you have 2 aspects for a given bike: 

Just like cars, things change between model years. Sometimes they spec up the bikes and sometimes they spec them down even with the same model number. And sometimes its for profit margin reasons or to improve sales next to competitors. In this case, for example, the main differences between the same bike in 2 model years are a slight geometry change, a different brand of brakes and a slightly bigger tire. As for different model numbers, they have different quality levels of components. Think of it as buying a car, with the base package, or the mid level package or top level package. Typically, you'll get some nicer components (better fork/brakes/drivetrain/wheels), though in some brands, there are more pronounced differences than different components bolted on to the same frame (e.g. the low end ones are made of aluminum and the high end ones are made of carbon fiber). 

For plotting routes, to transfer to the GPS. Depends on what sort of maps you want to use, some options include 

You could find a bike shop to fit the replacement fork. It may cost anything between £20 and £50, depends on the shop and just what needs done. Or if you want to replace the fork yourself, you will need several tools. Probably including several spanners, and possibly also headset tools. If you don't have these, you may be able to borrow them from someone. The best option could be a DIY bike workshop, eg the one suggested by Booker. They will have tools you can use, plus they may be able to advise on what you need to do. Depending on how your fork was damaged, its possible that other parts of the bike are broken. So it is worth checking it all carefully. The worst would be if the frame is bent or broken, that would be a lot of cost and work to replace. If the frame is damaged, you may be better off just replacing the whole bike. 

For a ready made part, see Fly Pedals. This is essentially just a metal platform, which you bolt cleats onto, then clip them into your pedals. They are threaded with holes for 2-bolt or 3-bolt cleats, so should work with most mountain bike or road bike clipless pedals (including SPD-SL). Note these are not yet available, but you can pre-order them from the Fly Pedals website. Some more details on Fly Pedals on Kickstarter - that page says delivery from end of July 2014. 

It is possible to buy a basic new fork for about £20 to £30. eg Raleigh 700C 1 1/8" Threaded Fork from Evans. Or there's a variety of options on Ebay, either new or used. Or some cycling forums have classified sections, so you could post a wanted advert. Though there are several things to check to ensure a replacement fork is compatible: 

That has a link to download it as a GPX file, so you could load that onto a GPS device, or other mapping software as required. 

Whereas a commuter bike is designed more for comfort, and carrying luggage as required. So it may have: 

Shimano make several models of pedals with SPD one side, and flat on the other. So they can be used with SPD shoes or normal shoes. Options include: PD-A530 

To go from a triple to a compact, you generally need to switch the front derailleur for one for doubles (make sure it can be attached to your frame and the right cable pull; front derailleurs have different cage shapes between doubles and triples), the front shifter (if indexed; you need a double shifter rather than a triple shifter, and it needs to have compatible cable pull with the front derailleur) and if you're using a bottom bracket with a spindle (like a standard JIS/ISO bottom bracket, Octalink, etc.), you may need to have a different spindle length (to get the right chainline). And of course, you need the compact crankset (which is compatible with your bottom bracket). In your case, you have a hollowtech II bottom bracket (with a Shimano road group), so you need: 

Reed switch (a switch which physically closes with a magnetic field). If you swap the two wires, the sensor will work fine (i.e. it doesn't matter). You can test for this using the continuity tester mode of your multimeter (you'll have continuity if the magnet is near the sensor, and open circuit with the magnet far away). Hall effect sensor (Generally, there are 3 wires on here: Vdd, ground and the output of the sensor). There are 3!=6 ways you can wire it (so 5 ways to mess it up). Most likely, you won't get a reading from the sensor until you get it right if you don't hook it up correctly. As noted by Chris H, if you have a Hall effect sensor, chances are the wires will be color coded so you'll figure out Vdd and ground, and the remainder is output. Your multimeter won't really help you here. An inductor (basically, a coil of wire). If you swap the two wires, the sensor would work fine (it'd be equivalent to moving the sensor to the other side of the bike, i.e. it doesn't matter). Your multimeter will show continuity always, but if you have a LCR meter, you can check the inductance. If you measure resistance, you should see a few ohms. 

Don't ride like a numpty -- jumping curbs at 18 stone is not a good idea, especially with a loaded bike. You need to ride more carefully. However, many non-racing bikes these days are rated for around 18-19 stone riders (but of course, heavier riders will be more likely to cause damage). As for what to look for, a good quality hub (e.g. Shimano Deore), 32 or 36 spokes and a good name rim. It's not just the components that matter, but how they're put together, which means if you're concerned about it, talk to a good wheel builder. Some examples of why its not just the spoke count or whatever are outlined at this page by Peter White (thus, there isn't an objective number that will tell you wheel x is going to be stronger than wheel y -- a poorly built 36 spoke wheel can be much weaker than a well built 32 spoke wheel). Also, make sure your tire pressure is set appropriately for your weight.
