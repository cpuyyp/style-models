I am requesting a certificate that must be approved by the CA administrator. When I make the request, it appears in the CA pending request folder and I right click to issue the certificate. but the approved certificates don’t appear in the personal folder of the requesting computer. I have tried refreshing the certificates mmc and updating the machine group policies but the certificate does not appear in the client computer. My question what I need to do after issuing a certificate in order make it appear in the certificate vault of the computer. 

I am in a command prompt of winPE and would like to start from there, the installation of windows 8. I have the files of the installation media on the local drive but I dont know what is the file that I need to execute in order to start the windows installation wizard.

I am trying to create a script in powershell that request and install an available application for a user or computer in the sccm application catalog. I know that there is a way to force sccm client actions using wmi methods. Example 

I am creating a schedules task to run just before it's created and deleted after it runs. I am using the tool, schtasks to create the scheduled task, but i havent found the parameter to run the task "At task creation/modification" 

There is a way that by executing a wmi method or command line, in the users computer, to force the installation of and application. 

Create or edit the vhosts.conf in your apache conf.d (or equivalent depending on OS). Use the NameVirtualHost directive to handle the DNS names. 

I'm working on getting some servers running in the EC2 environment and I'm noticing some errors with ntpd trying to sync (using CentOS). I was reading on this site and the impression I get is that I don't need to run ntpd since EC2 is Xen and the host takes care of the time for the virtual servers. $URL$ Is this accurate or do I need to figure out how to get around the error I'm having? cap_set_proc() failed to drop root privileges It looks like it involves building a new kernel and other stuff I'd rather not do if I don't have to. 

For an internal network, if you don't want to pay for the wildcard cert (or dedicated cert for the server), simply create a self signed certificate. Since it's your company, it shouldn't be too much of an issue for the users to accept the certificate. And depending on how your network works (and your admin friendliness), you might even be able to push it to the users so they won't be bothered. If you're dealing with any sort of sensitive information, you should be doing it over HTTPS. 

You can also add ports to the ProxyPass directive if you don't want your friend to change firewall rules, service setting etc. Or you can even be a reverse proxy for another external IP address too. 

I have submitted a certificate request to my windows standalone-CA, I already issued the certificate by approving the pending request, but I dont know ow to export the .cer file from the CA 

I need to request a certificate via command line I have investigated that certreq is the tool that can request the certificate. I am used to the gui to request the certificate by selecting one of the available templates, but I need to do the same via command line. Any ideas about how to achieve this? 

My question is; how can I create a scheduled task via command line, with the trigger “At task creation/modification". 

I am creating a VPN in a virtual server in azure using the RRAS role, I have found that I can have internet access while i am connected to the vpn by disabling in the network adapter advanced option "use default gateway on remote network". By disabling this, the traffic and the resolution begins to flow through my local router and I need that all the resolution and routing to be performed by rras how can y create a vpn full tunnel vpn in RRAS with internet access? 

I have downloaded a media from msdn of windows server 2012 to upgrade a server core to gui, but this media does not have de winsxs folder in the source folder there is just a SXS folder. I have tried to install the feature with this folder as a, path but is not working. My question is what is the difference between the winsxs and the sxs folder and why is this folder missing from the installation media. 

I'm wanting SNI on my CentOS 5.5 dev server and since it looks like I'm out of luck with the current repo versions of openssl and apache, before I go compiling custom RPMs I thought I'd see if I could get it working with gnutls. Anyone know how to do this? According to yum, gnutls is already installed but I don't see it in my apache modules directory. 

You could also do this using virtual hosts and setup Apache as a reverse proxy. This is how I have it setup where I work. 

A reboot will keep it's settings. If you bring up a new instance then you'll need some way to manage the IP's. A startup script is probably the way to go. Pull the instance metadata and update a config file (perhaps in S3) or DNS entry. You can also use an elastic IP and configure a cname which will resolve to the internal address within the EC2 environment. To do this, assign an elastic IP and note the public DNS string (there's a pattern but it's good to check) and create the cname record with it. The advantage with elastic IP cnames is you don't have to wait for DNS propagation. 

I've recently been moving our instances to EBS instances (CentOS) and still have a bit of confusion on what's happening when I "stop" and instance. I have some of my services with runlevels 345 on but when I start a stopped instance the services don't start. What's actually happening when I issue a stop command to the instance, and how do I get my services to start automatically when I start the instance up again? 

I am not sure this is done correctly or has any effect at all. I also did not find any mentioning of iptables in any file in /var/log. So what else can I do? Thank you for your help. p.s.: After adding the crontab line as suggested by lain, I can find the following in the file /var/logauth.log 

so the relative link now points somewhere wrong. To fix it, I added to the top of another init script the line (ATTENTION: HACK!!!) 

and similar for all runlevels, the links create looked totally perfect in the recovery mode. However, when I was finally able to log back in using the hack described above, I could see that all the links were broken, i.e. 

which worked fine and allowed me to log back in. I then removed all the broken links and created new ones, using update.rc. Again thank you very much for all the help! 

I looked in /etc/rc*.d/ for a link to the /etc/init.d/ssh script and found none. So I am expecting that sshd is not started properly on boot. Since I cannot run any programs in my system, I cannot use update-rc to change this. I tried to make a link manually using ln -s /etc/init.d/ssh /etc/rc6.d/K09sshd and restarted the server - this did not fix the problem. I do not know wether it is at all possible to do it like this and whether it is correct to create it in rc6.d and whether the K09 is correct. I just copied that from apache. I also tried to change my /etc/iptables.rules file to allow everything:
