The answer to your question is no. More generally, for functions of exponential type $b$ (which means $|f(z)|\leq Me^{b|z|}$), define the indicator: $$h(\theta)=\limsup_{r\to\infty}\frac{\log|f(re^{i\theta})|}{r}.$$ Then there is a description of all possible indicators: they are trigonometrically convex: $$h''+h\geq 0,$$ where derivatives should be understood in the generalized sense where they do not exist. Equivalently and more intuitively: possible indicators are exactly the support functions of compact convex sets. From which follows that $\min h\geq -\max h$. There are many deep generalizations of these things to functions which are not necessarily of exponential type, and for decrease not necessarily on a straight line. For example, there is a theorem of Hayman and Kjellberg that for every curve $\gamma$ tending to infinity, $$\limsup_{z\to\infty,\;z\in\gamma}\frac{\log|f(z)|}{M(|z|)}\geq -1.$$ This holds for every non-constant entire function (not necessarily of exponential type). 

No. Complex structure on $X$ "knows" whether an end is a hole or a puncture. The conformal invariant responsible for this is called the extremal length of the family of closed curves surrounding the hole/puncture. See Ahlfors, Lectures on quasiconformal mappings. The simplest case is a sphere with a puncture (conformally equivalent to the plane) vs sphere with a hole (conformally equivalent to a disk). These two things are conformally not equivalent. This is essentially Anton Petrunin's remark. 

There is a spectral theorem for unbounded operators. It is not simple. But if you have an unbounded operator, and want to use the spectral theorem, you have to use it:-) The difficult thing is to actually define the operator (using the boundary conditions) and prove that it is self-adjoint. Verification of all facts you mentioned is not simple, but there are many good books on this, some of them are: MR1186643 Berezin, F. A.; Shubin, M. A. The Schrödinger equation. Kluwer , Dordrecht, 1991. xviii+555. Reed and Simon, Methods of modern mathematical physics. 

In the work of Riemann you can see both notions, but they are not clearly distinguished. The relation between these two things is the following. A Riemann surface spread over the sphere is a pair $(F,p)$ where $F$ is an abstract surface, and $p:F\to S$ is a holomorphic map to the Riemann sphere. Critical points of $p$ are called "branch points" of the surface $(F,p)$, and so on. If you have an analytic germ, and perform an analytic continuation over all paths on which continuation is possible, you obtain a Riemann surface spread over the sphere $(F,p)$ whose $F$-part is an abstract Riemann surface. To visualize a Riemann surface spread over the sphere, you make cuts and paste it from sheets. The cuts and sheets are arbitrary to some extent (they are not intrinsically connected with $(F,p)$; the fact that physicists frequently ignore). Most of the modern literature uses the first meaning. Some modern mathematical works (besides the elementary complex variables textbooks) which deal with surfaces spread over the plane or sphere are the papers of J. Ecalle on resurgent functions, or my survey on Geometric theory of meromorphic functions, which can be found in $URL$ or the work of H. Stahl, arXiv:1205.3811. For many people with modern education (who think that a Riemann surface is a "complex 1-dimensional manifold"), the expression "the Riemann surface of $\sqrt{z}$" is meaningless, because this is just the same as the sphere. 

For statement 2, you have to specify whether $f$ is allowed to have zeros. (If yes, this is a metric with isolated singularities, but can be complete. If $f$ is free of zeros, it is always incomlete by a deep result of A. Huber MR0094452) To prove statement 1, it is better to make the change of the variable $z=1/w$, then we have to prove that $$\int_1^\infty\int_{-\pi}^\pi |f(re^{it})|dt \; r^{-3}dr<\infty$$ implies that $f$ has a simple pole at $\infty$. This can be done with the help of the inequality $$\max_{t}u(re^{it})\leq \frac{R+r}{R-r}\int u(Re^{it})dt +O(1), \quad 2< r< R,$$ which is true for every subharmonic function $u$, and we apply it to $u=|f|$. The inequality follows from the Poisson formula applied to the least harmonic majorant of $u$ in the ring $2< |z|\leq R$. 

Every real polynomial $f$ is the sum of TWO polynomials $g,h$ with all zeros real (of the same degree). Indeed, take any $g_1$ of the same degree as $f$, whose roots are real and simple. Small perturbation does not destroy this property. Therefore $h_1=g_1+\epsilon f$ also has real zeros when $\epsilon$ is small and real. Now take $g=-g_1/\epsilon, \; h=h_1/\epsilon$. We obtain $f=g+h$, and both $g,h$ have real zeros. A stronger result is available: Every real entire function $f$ of exponential type and satisfying $$\int_{-\infty}^\infty\frac{\log|f(x)|}{1+x^2}dx<\infty$$ (evidently this class contains all real polynomials) is a sum of two entire functions of the same exponential type with all zeros real (and moreover, with all $\pm1$ points real). Your conjecture is not a formal corollary from this result, because it does not say that the summands are polynomials if $f$ is a polynomial, but if you look at the proof you see that when applied to a polynomial it gives polynomials of the same degree (the general idea of the proof is the same as in my proof in the first paragraph).

AMS Translations, Ser. 2, 131.American Mathematical Society, Providence, RI, 1986. viii+120 pp. ISBN: 0-8218-3106-2 Remark 1. There is a lot of arbitrary choice in the construction in the first paragraph. One reasonable choice of $g_1$ would be the Chebyshev polynomial of degree $d=\mathrm{deg}\, f$. It has $d+1$ points of alternance, where the critical values are $\pm1$. So if we take $\epsilon<1/\| f\|,$ where $\| f\|$ is the $\sup$-norm on $[-1,1]$, then the construction works, because $g_1+\epsilon f$ has at least $d$ sign changes on $[0,1]$ thus all roots are real. So the coefficients of $g$ and $h$ can be estimated in terms of $\| f\|$ or in terms of the sup-norm on any interval. One can probably state and solve some extremal problem about this. Remark 2. In the original problem (see the reference on BAMS in the question), $f$ is a Hurwitz polynomial (zeros in the left-half-plane), and it is required that $g,h$ be also Hurwitz. This can be easily achieved even without the condition that $f$ is Hurwitz. Indeed, the argument in Remark 1 yields $g,h$ whose zeros lie on an arbitrary prescribed interval. 

Obtaining old issues of this journal is difficult, though perhaps some American libraries have it, and you can try Interlibrary Loan (ILL). Alternatively, there are two volumes of collected papers Markov's Collected papers, MR0050525 the papers you are looking for must be in this volume. Our library has this, so you can surely obtain this via ILL. BTW, historians say that Markov chains were introduced for the first time in his paper of 1913, here is an account available online: $URL$ It gives a reference to an English translation which must be easily available. Also: $URL$ which has links to some translations. Here is one of the papers you are asking: $URL$ 

This question belongs more to philosophy rather than mathematics, so it might be out of scope of this site. But the general answer is that mathematical models are only an approximation to reality, and we choose those approximations which are convenient. For example, we can discover sometimes that the space/time is not really continuous but consists of some discrete objects. But this will not make calculus based on the concept of real number useless or obsolete. One can argue without end whether real numbers really correspond to something "real". Nevertheless they are useful in physics and engineering. (See, for example, N. J. Wildberger, Real fish, real numbers, real jobs, The Mathematical Intelligencer, Volume 21, Issue 2, pp 4–7.) Same with probability. Continuous distributions historically arise as approximations to discrete distributions (normal distribution is an approximation of the binomial distribution via the de Moivre-Laplace theorem). But normal distribution is much nicer from the mathematical point of view and therefore it must be used, even if when the "real" distribution under consideration is binomial. In other words, the accepted axioms of Probability are chosen (from the several proposed systems) because of their mathematical convenience, rather than because they better approximate the "real world" from the philosophical point of view. (Of the systems of mathematical foundations of probability which were competing with Kolmogorov's axioms, I can mention those proposed by S. Bernstein, R. von Mises and H. Steinhaus. And philosophic considerations played a secondary role in the choice). 

In your statement, you do not say explicitly, whether $p$ is aloowed to have other zeros, except those in the set $A$. If you want to construct an entire function with zeros and ones exactly prescribed, this is clearly impossible when your sets $A$ and $B$ are both finite. For the reason explained by Robin Chapman. If you want ones to be exactly prescribed, and function having zeros on the set $A$, and perhaps other zeros, then this is possible: take $p(z)=1+(z-b_1)...(z-b_n)\exp g(z)$ and use interpolation for $g$. 

A good modern source in English is N. Akhiezer, Elements of the theory of elliptic functions. The formulas you are asking are in section 21, chapter IV. 

I think that the answer is no. Here is a somewhat related problem. Every curve curve $C$ of genus >0, has meromorphic functions $x,y$ on it which are not related by any equation of the form $f(x)=g(y)$. I denote by $(x)=(x)^+-(x)^-$ the principal divisor of an element $x$, zeros minus poles. If $x$ and $y$ are two elemets of the field of meromorphic functions on $C$, related by $f(x)=g(y)$, where $f,g$ are ratonal functions, then the divisors of poles of $x$ and $y$ are related as follows: $$m(x)^-\sim n(y)^-,$$ where $\sim$ means the usual equivalence of divisors. (Two dividors $d$ and $e$ are equivalent if $d=e+(z)$). And $m,n$ are degrees of $f,g$. Now the factor of the set of all divisors over this equivalent equation is a torus of dimension $g$ ($g$ is the genus of $C$). We only need the fact that it is uncountable for $g>0$. So we can always find incommensurable divisors of the form $(x)^-$ and $(y)^-$. These $x$ and $y$ are related by some polynomial relation $F(x,y)=0$, but cannot be related by an equation of the form $f(x)=g(y)$. This solution was explained me by Drinfeld in 1980 when I asked him more general question: Can every algebraic relation $F(x,y)=0$ be obtained from a chain $x=x_1,x_2,x_3,\ldots,x_n=y$ where $x_i$ and $x_{i+1}$ are related by $f_i(x_i)=f_{i+1}(x_{i+1})$, with some rational functions $f_i$, by elimination of $x_2,...x_{n-1}$? The answer is no, for the same reason). 

I think the question is too broad. What are "specific properties"? All sorts of equilibrium measures from potential theory quality. Here is an example of a deep result: on every compact set in $R^n$ there exists a non-zero measure satisfying the doubling condition, which means that the measure of every ball is at most constant times the measure of twice smaller ball with the same center. MR0765294. 

You probably want $L$ to be continuous with respect to the topology of $E$, not just $C(z)$ And $E$ is equipped with its usual topology: uniform convergence on compact subsets of $\Omega\backslash K$. If this is so, the extension is impossible. Even if your $K$ is one point. In this case a function $f\in E$ expands into a Laurent series $\sum a_nz^n$ and $\overline\partial$ must be an infinite sum of derivatives of $\delta$-function. This will not converge for a test function in the Schwartz space $D$. But this defines a continuous linear functional on a much smaller space of germs of analytic functions in a neighborhood of $K$, that is a hyperfunction. In other words, in this case $\overline\partial$ does not exist in the sense of distributions but exists in the sense of hyperfunctions. 

Unlike Mathscinet, Zentralblatt usually reviews translations. I checked Zentralblatt, and found no translation of this work. So probably English translation does not exist. Actually very few works of Gauss have been translated into Engish (I know only 2 or 3). However I believe that there are two detailed expositions of this work: In English: I. Todhunter, History of the mathematical theories of attraction and the figure of the Earth, 2 volumes, 1873, Dover reprint 1962. And in French: P. Appel, Traite de macanique rationnelle. Tome 4, Fasc. I. Figures d'equilibre d'une mass liquide homogene en rotation, Paris, 1932. 

You have to specify what you mean by $L^2$. Is this $L^2$ with respect to Lebesgue measure (area) in $D$? Whatever you mean by $L^2$, the answer is "no". The reason is Jensen's formula. It says that a function which has too many zeros must grow fast. If you want to solve it in weighted $L^2$ space, then your weight must be related to the growth rate of the set $X$. If instead you want to fix the weight in $L^2$, the conditions on $X$ will come from the Jensen formula. If you are interested in $L^2$ without weight, look in the books about Bergman space. There you can find the exact conditions on $X$. 

The idea behind this theorem is actually simple. For the Fourier transform to make sense (with usual understanding of the integral) the function $\omega$ must be summable, that is in $L^1(0,+\infty)$. This immediately implies that the Fourier integral converges not only on the real line but also in the lower half-plane, so $f$ is an analytic function in the lower half-plane which is bounded. Indeed, $$|f(t)|\leq\int_0^\infty|\omega(t)|e^{\Im t}dt\leq\int_0^\infty|\omega(t)|dt,$$ because $\Im t\leq 0$. Now, there is a general principle that a bounded analytic function cannot be too small. This is easier to see in the unit disc. $\log|f(z)|$ is subharmonic which means that $$\log|f(0)|\leq\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_0^{2\pi}\log|f(e^{i\theta})|d\theta.$$ The integrand is bounded from above, so the integral of the NEGATIVE part of $\log|f(e^{i\theta})|$ must converge. (If $f(0)=0$ this is still true: just divide $f$ by an appropriate power of $z$; this will not change the right hand side). This is called Jensen's inequality. Now, this fact that the negative part of $\log|f |$ is integrable, when transfered from the disc to the half-plane via conformal mapping, means exactly that the logarithmic integral $$\int_0^\infty\frac{\log|f(t)|}{1+t^2}dt$$ cannot diverge to $-\infty$, that is the Wiener-Paley theorem. Of course, one can argue directly in the half-plane without the reference to the unit disc. Boundedness of $\log|f|$ from above implies that the Poisson integral of its boundary value on the real line must converge, which is exactly the same condition. Now Beurling-Malliavin theorem says essentially that the condition of convergence of the log integral is best possible (subject to some technical regularity assumptions). Even if you consider $\omega$ of arbitrarily small compact support. A good modern reference for all these things is the books of P. Koosis.

Let me explain first what Anton wrote: we construct piecewise linear function $f$ by on $[0,n]$ by induction in $n$. Suppose that it is already constructed on $[0,n]$. Define the right derivative $D^+f(n)$ so that your inequality is violated. Then extend $f$ linearly on $[n,n+1]$. Then smoothen, if you need a smooth function. However, inequality $f'\leq f^{1+\epsilon}$ holds on ``most'' of the positive ray: the set where it is violated has finite measure. Indeed, assuming that $f$ is increasing, let $E$ be the set where $f'>f^{1+\epsilon}$, and $a>0$ is the left-most point of $E$. Then $$|E|\leq\int_E\frac{f'}{f^{1+\epsilon}}dx=\int_{f(E)}\frac{dw}{w^{1+\epsilon}}<\int_{f(a)}\frac{dw}{w^{1+\epsilon}}<\infty.$$ I do not know what is the appropriate extension of this argument to higher dimensions, but certainly some statements of this sort can be made. 

If $0$ is a pole, then there is a formula for the residue $$\mathrm{res}_0=\lim_{x\to 0}\frac{1}{(n-1)!}\frac{d^{n-1}}{dx^{n-1}}x^nf(x),$$ which involves only the restriction of $f$ on the real line. If $0$ is an essential singularity, there is no formula, except the complex integral defining the residue, and it is hard to imagine any formula which will involve only the restriction on the real line and some limits. The reason is that in a neighborhood of an essential singularity, every continuous function on the real line can be approximated with any accuracy (error tending to zero arbitrarily fast as $x\to 0$) by an analytic function with any residue.
