Snake bites (i.e pinch flats) depend on tyre strength, tube thickness (in case you use tubes), rider weight, riding style, terain and luck (or unluck). You really need to experiment with the pressures. For example test if 25/30 PSI (front/rear) feels good and see how long you can go with that without a pinch flat. If you get a pinch flat on the rear once a year then I guess you can continue using 25/30. But if you, like me, get them once a week then you definitelly need to increase the pressure. Note that pinch flats usually happen on the rear. In the last 3 years I've had 2 pinch flats on the front and like 20 on the rear. If in the end of this iterative process you have increased the pressure too much (e.g 45+ PSI) then there is a high possibility that the specific bike and tyres you use are not meant to do what you make them do. i.e you need heavier tyres or more suspension. Note that if you switch to tubeless you'll be able to run the same PSI and most probably completely avoid pinch flats. Note though that pinch flats are still possible. Also, make sure you read: 

As soon as the freecoaster engages it will come to an abrupt hault. If you do that while going backwards that means that your front end will most likely want to rise. In BMX this is usually accompanied by a 180 degrees movement of the body so the bike turns and and you continue forward with the momentum you already had going backwards. Note that a freecoaster may have been set in such a way that it has some degrees of slack (a dead period) between pedaling and the moment the freecoaster engages. This, for example, can be set to 60 degrees (1/6 of full circle) or even more if you are into bmx flatland riding. The reason is that on some tricks you need to be on the pedals going backwards (possibly only on the rear wheel only) so you really wouldn't want an accidental engage of the freecoaster due to your foot minor movements while trying to balance. 

The is the tool for this job. Remove the outer cap using an allen key and then install the CWP-7. There is no need to tighten it ultra hard. Then use an allen key on the CWP-7 and start tightening the bolt. The extractor will "penetrate" the crank and the crank arm will start detaching itself from the other crank arm which also has the spindle. 

One possible and modern solution is: none. Go 1x10 or 1x11 with a narrow wide chain ring and a RD with a clutch. 

decide not to absorb anything and let the bike (suspensions) handle it, or absorb a bit by leaning my back (humping) which is obviously super wrong and dangerous and has already caused me some lower back pains 

"Recommended psi" are just recommendations and your weight is just one parameter. Other parameters which play role in this are: 

A more important reason to mount it to you head is that you'll most probably end up with the correct footage. The handlebars do not always point to where we are looking. Examples: 

I think you are refering to compression. Rebound is damping when the fork travel tries to return to original length. Compression is damping when the fork travel is being reduced (in high or low speed) due to a bump, a root, a landing. You cannot have a single rebound setting that will be the best for you in all terrains. Thus you'll either want to find a generally good setting that will work in the most places you ride at, or fiddle with it whenever you change terrain or riding style (dh vs dirt jumps). I suggest you aim for the first, at least for 6-12 months of riding with your new hardware. A middle setting generally is a safe start. Count the clicks you have and just set it at the middle. In that setting start riding in trails that you know well so you can get a feel of the suspensions. If it seems to work well then leave it like that. 

For downhill and all forms of trail riding (freeride, enduro, all mountain etc) the prefered way is 1 finger (index) on each lever. Anything else can be dangerous. If the brakes are not powerful enough for dealing with this then they either need fix or replacement to proper brakes for this type of riding. Also, riders position the levers closer to the stem (leaving 1 to 2 inches space between the grip and lever clamp) in order to enforce that only 1 finger can go on the lever. This also helps the finger pull the lever from its most powerful spot. 

how the rider unclips at 1:10 in order to save himself at 1:12. This of course will work well as long as you've set a moderate tension so you can unclip pretty easily (but not very very easily). 

my list of favourite energy bombs (some are not very portable and some others you may not be able to easily find them in your country): 

Yes, your knees. In order to ride comparably to a full suspension you need to be more skilled on the bike. A lot of people with full suspension bikes who are serious about their riding also ride hardtails in order to gain that skill. 

I won't suggest any brands but here are some ingredients that will allow you to go cheap and reliable: 

You should only care about sag % and the amount of travel that you use in your regular do-it-all rides (more is better; 80-90% of travel used is the usual). 

I don't think you'll have a problem. Aero spokes are no less strong than regular double butted spokes. I use them for downhill riding and whenever one breaks (due to bad handling, loose spokes or extreme impacts) it is never on the bladed flat area. They'll either break close to the nipple or close to the spoke head. Also note that usually spokes break one by one and never all together. So even in the rare scenario that one breaks (probably because they where too loose) the wheel will be able to continue riding normally and you'll replace it and retighten as soon as you can. 

On your rear derailleur there are two boundaries adjustment screws marked and . These are the high and low limit adjusters. Most probably your screw is way screwed in and doesn't allow the derailleur to move to 1st and 2nd gears. You need to unscrew this until it can move there. Have a look at $URL$ for more detailed info. 

Whether your numbers are descent depend on who will answer. I've never riden road so I find those numbers descent, but some people who ride road may tell you that those numbers are mediocre. If you want to find out how you compare against others (and your self) in parts of that ride I suggest that you start using strava. Used wiselly it's a great tool for enhancing your rides, improving yourself as a rider and adding a lot of fun to routes that you may find boring. 

Just keep on doing the same route and you'll see progress very fast. Also this will soon not be true: 

New bikes are usually good to go. The LBS (local bike shop) will usually allow you to bring it back after a months time in order to readjust and tighten things that may have come lose. Ask about whether this is supported or not. Also ask about the guarantee and its exact details. Also you could ask for a test ride (even in the parking lot) to make sure that the bike works. Generally the bike should: 

Most (at least those who pedal more than 5 miles per ride and have been riding for more than 1 year) use some form of spandex with padding below the shorts. 

This is a hard problem. I've changed 4 knee pads through 3 years in order to find the best ones which stay in place. So, to answer your question, in order to have the pads stay in place you need: 

You can get injuries from all kind of exercices if not done correctly. You cannot get injuries by cycling (unless you crash or overdo it or have bad posture). What you can end up with though with cycling only is a weak upper body. 

You'll only choose the rear wheen travel based on what you want to do. For example if you want to do downhill racing then 203mm is the norm. Whichever brand and frame you choose will come with a rear shock installed which has very specific size specifications, e.g 9.5x3 (that is eye to eye and shock travel in inches) and even if you wanted to change the rear shock you'd have to go with those specs. 

Your bleed was probably not perfect. It is normal. Pulling a perfect bleed is a bit hard for first timers. Possible reasons for a not perfect bleed: 

Having said that, I don't think that you need to change your chain and cassette. Unless you do racing you can get away with the same chain and cassette for 2-3 years. 

The best thing you can do is contact the LBS (local bike shop) or online shop where from you got the bike. They'll tell you what to do (most probably handle it with the distributor themselves or tell you to contact the distributor directly). Take good photos of the issue and forward them to the ones you contact. Keep your purchase receipt handy for when requested. 

It would be very wrong to be able to reach that by pressing down hard. It would also be wrong to use that 20mm on a soft trail ride. That 20mm is there for dealing with the very rough stuff such as jumps or drops to flat, hitting rocks or roots hard etc. That 20mm may save you from falling once or twice and is also there to prevent you from damaging the forks. Note though that bottoming out the fork once per ride is not very bad and will most probably not damage the forks. Also note that I've also used a talas 32 100/120/140 2009 for 2 years and the last 20mm of travel would only work on drops and hard hits on fast downhill runs. 

Aaron's answer is great but since you mention the words "downhill" and "technical descents" the rule of thumb is that "constant pressure on the brakes" is not appropriate. It does not allow you to ride safely, enjoy the ride and evolve as a rider. That's because: 

The crash made the chain drop from the currently selected front chainring to a smaller one (i.e if you have 3 rings and you where on the middle, it jumped on the 1st - lefmost- smaller one). The crash didn't change any gear on the shifter though, it just made the chain pop to a smaller ring. Maybe not fully, but partially. Afterwards cranking a couple of pedal strokes made you feel that the pedals where "moving fast". After a while though, and since the front deraileur was still in the original position (maybe middle ring), the chain moved again back to the middle ring making the gearing ratio as previous. Dropping the chain is common in MTBs without a chain guide. What happened to you is normal. 

Doesn't happen. The hands and elbows in modern MTBs are very very wide compared to the shorts and at the same level/height with the shorts. If something is to catch, it's the hands/handlebars/elbows/shoulders first. Never the shorts. 

I used to ride with skate shoes for a year and it was not good. I didn't know it. Generally skate shoes: 

If you have a modern BMX then the saddle should be super low. If it is not then move it at the very bottom. BMX bikes are very very stiff (100psi tyres, rigid cromo frame, rock solid wheels) so you need to absorb the imact with your feet and upper body. Landing with the rear wheel first (just slightly) helps trigger the feet at the exactly correct time. Another thing that helps is that when you start descending (from the bunnyhop) you extend your feet in order to give yourself enough room for absorption. If you don't absorb with your feet then the weakest link will have to deal with the whole impact (knees, pedals, head tube of frame etc). Keep in mind though that parts do fail. Broken pedals and bent rims is not something unexpectable in the BMX world. 

This cannot be taught. No matter how much theoretical advice you seek and how much you think about it, you'll never learn how to fall if you don't fall often, especially at a young age. After years of BMXing I think that one needs 10-100 falls to start becoming better at it. 

On the other hand, not braking everywhere on the course will let you go over obstacles, roots, rocks easier. That's especially important for the front wheel which, even when under minimal braking, when it hits an obstacle it doesn't react very well. It transmits a lot of feedback on the handlebars and unless you know what you are doing may give you slight problems (regarding riding stance, line choice, balance) which is something that is not welcome when riding downhill. Note though that riding downhill is hard. If you find yourself unable to do proper braking on a course then maybe it's too steep for you. Find a flatter course and try to master all of its parts with minimal and purposeful braking. 

Theoretically they are not. One could design a pivot system which would give 180mm of rear wheel travel with a 18mm shock travel. This would not work correctly though. The ratio between the wheel travel and the shock travel is called the suspension leverage ratio. A 180 to 76.2 setup gives us a leverage ratio of ~2.36 to 1. Some companies (e.g $URL$ claim that a lower leverage ratio (e.g 2:1) has significant advantages for downhill racing. 

Start with 40 PSI on the rear and 35 PSI on the front and ride at that pressure for a couple of rides to understand how it feels. Then adjust +-3 PSI to see how the handling changes. If you ever get a pinch flat increase 1 PSI on front and 4 on the rear. For trails, aim for a 10-20% height reduction on the tyre height on where it touches the ground when you are standing on the bike.
