This is extremely helpful because it allows a quick and robust interpretation of geologic processes if a similar facies is found in another rock around the world. 

Matan, the continents where we all live "float" on the Earth's mantle. The continents are made out of relatively brittle rock called the "Crust" and the mantle is made out of much more ductile material. The mantle, however, is NOT liquid. It is just much more ductile than the crust so, in geologic time, it can flow (like silly putty). Also, the mantle is much more dense, so the crust doesn't sink into it by gravitational/bouyancy forces alone. 

Felsic magmas contain much more silica (SiO2) than mafic magmas (almost by definition). The excess silica chains cause the magma to be much more viscous and therefore more prone to explosive eruptions (they trap gas and require high pressures to flow). This is why felsic magmas produce crazy explosive pyroclastic flows (forming ignimbrite) and very mafic magmas (like in Hawaii) just flow nicely downhill. Btw, water decreases the viscosity of magmas, but the amount depends on composition as well as temperature. There is a nice transition between felsic magmas and mafic magmas showing that decrease in viscosity. Check out the source below: Whittington et al (2009): "The viscosity of hydrous dacitic liquids: implications for the rheology of evolving silicic magmas" 

"Traveltime inversion" is a very broad category that includes any inverse problem where the input data is a time-delay from a seismic source impulse to when it is received at a seismometer. This includes refraction tomography, reflection tomography, and most implementations of full-waveform inversion (i.e. using diving waves). The output (i.e. what you are solving for) here is a velocity model that best explains all time-delay data simultaneously given the known physics of wave propagation. "Waveform inversion" is the category that includes all post-migration reflection seismic inverse problems where the input is a single trace or an offset gather (constant X,Y for all input reflections). The output in these are the vertically-varying elastic properties (acoustic impedance, vp/vs, density, etc) that best explain the observed seismic trace/gather (i.e. waveform) given the physics of seismic reflection. This is commonly called "amplitude inversion" because amplitude is one of the main inputs here (although phase and frequency are involved as well). "Hybrid inversion" is what Yilmaz is calling the recent methods that try to use both the seismic time-delays and ampltidues/waveforms to solve for the best elastic property model that simultaneously explain both types of observations. He cites some recent examples in that paper. The first one I saw on this was Misra and Sacchi (2008). The problem with this stuff is that things become highly nonlinear and therefore require global optimization techniques which are way slower. "Joint inversion" is just combining different types of geophysical data. For example, let's say you are trying to map the 3D structure of a salt dome. You can use 3D seismic reflection data to map the top of a salt dome easily, but the base is usually really tough due to imaging problems below the salt. Gravity data only gives you the cumulative response of the entire 3D structure below so many salt dome shapes could give you the same gravity response. However, you can use the seismic data to map the top of the salt, then the gravity data to constrain the base, then use that model to re-migrate the seismic data and you should have a good top and base of salt. Similarly, you could pose the problem as a joint-inverse problem where you are looking for the best 3D structural model that simultaneously properly migrates the seismic data and also explains the gravity response. Hope this helps! 

In the case of cooling magma to form rocks, the slower the cooling, the larger the crystals will be. So rocks that cooled near the surface, will be composed of tiny crystals while rocks that cooled deeper will have larger crystals. 

I have a seismic dataset that contains a depth-migrated seismic (amplitude) volume in depth and then the exact same volume converted to time using the migration velocities. Unfortunately, I do not have the velocity volume used to do the conversion. How can I extract the velocity volume using only these two (amplitude) volumes? Since the signals are exactly the same, just stretched and squeezed, I believe the solution will require something like dynamic time warping but I don't have enough experience with this to make it work. Since each trace in the volume is converted independently, this reduces to a 1D problem. An optimal solution for a single trace can be used to solve the entire 3D volume (unless there is a lot of error and then we can have lateral instability, but I can live with that). I will eventually need to code it in MATLAB for application on sgy-formatted data. 

Additionally, experimental geologists will then try to recreate the set of characteristics in a laboratory flume experiment in order to gain even more insight as to the necessary flow conditions that had to have taken place. 

Transverse isotropy (also called hexagonal symmetry) is a special kind of anisotropy in which there exists a special "axis of symmetry" such that the property you are measuring appears to be the same as you make measurements perpendicular to this axis. Basically, rotating around this axis of symmetry, the property looks pretty much the same, i.e. it is isotropic in this transverse direction. However, once you go off axis, then the measured property will change. 

That looks like vesicular basalt. Does it have green crystals on it (olivine)? If so, then it will be pretty heavy. Just my guess... 

In geology (especially in sedimentary geology), transverse isotropy is usually a good approximation to many phenomena (elasticity, permeability, heat conductivity, etc.) due to the fact rocks are deposited mostly horizontally. This means that things will look very similar laterally (in both N-S and E-W directions) but very different vertically. 

It depends on what your starting information about your seismic data is. For example, if you know that your data contains an impulsive (minimum phase) source wavelet (i.e. the acquisition source was dynamite or a big ol' hammer, or some other impulsive source, and has not been modified) then you can apply the workflow of txpaulm or use spiking deconvolution. But realize that you are making an assumption about the shape of your wavelet's phase spectrum, which is a very good assumption most of the time. If you don't want to make the minimum phase assumption for your wavelet (i.e. you think you have a mixed phase wavelet), you will need to make some other assumption or incorporate some other piece of information. A very popular method for estimating a mixed phased wavelet is that of Walden and White (1998). They incorporate additional information from a reflectivity series calculated at a well and then find the impulse response filter that best predicts (in the least squares sense) the seismic data extracted along the well path. The trick here is that you are assuming that you know the velocity function (time-depth curve) along the well to correctly compare the well's calculated reflectivity series (in depth) with the extracted seismic data (in time). Errors in the time-depth curve will propagate into your extracted wavelet. What you can do is to first approximate the real wavelet with a simple zero-phase phase wavelet extracted from the autocorrelation of the seismic data (or you can use a Ricker wavelet of a reasonable dominant frequency if you want) and make a synthetic seismogram at the well. Then modify the time-depth relation along the well path (i.e. stretch and squeeze your synthetic) until your well is kinda-sorta fitting. Then go back and extract a better constant-phase wavelet (no more Ricker) through autocorrelation and try to modify the constant phase while simultaneously tweaking the time-depth curve along the well. You should already be close the right time-depth curve but this will get you pretty damn close to the answer. Once you are happy with the position of your synthetic with respect to the seismic data, then you can apply the method of Walden and White (1998) to get the best fit filter that gets you from the reflectivity at the well to the seismic data along the well path. This filter is your mixed phase wavelet (at that one well location). If you do this at a couple wells and notice that the wavelet is relatively consistent, you can average the wavelets and apply the method of txpaulm to make your entire seismic data zero-phase. Ok then, sorry for the long block of text... Now, what if you don't have wells or don't want to use them for some reason? Well, you can still estimate the phase spectrum of your wavelet directly from the seismic data by using the method Velis and Ulrych (1996) (and optimized by Misra and Sacchi (2007)) based on 4th order cumulant matching between the seismic trace and an all-pass filter. Since this optimization problem is nonlinear, the method is computationally intensive as it requires a global optimization algorithm (Very Fast Simulated Annealing) and can be sensitive to noise. However, since this method does not require a well, it can be used to test the stationarity assumption about the seismic wavelet. Mixed-phase wavelet extraction is a very popular field of research and you can probably find more information looking through the SEG and EAGE online libraries. Good luck! -Antonio 

This question is in the context of velocity model building for reflection seismic imaging (between 0km and 10km in a sedimentary basin). This is really a rock physics question disguised as an imaging question. A brief description of what I am trying to do: In order to perform seismic imaging (aka seismic migration), we assume that the velocity structure of the earth is known. This allows us to place the recorded reflection amplitudes in the correct location in 3D space to give us a real representation of the underlying geology (including depth, dips, and scaled reflection coefficients). We can obtain this laterally varying velocity model from iterative traveltime tomography of the same data. We typically account for the polar velocity anisotropy (i.e. difference in velocity of the same rock when measured parallel vs perpendicular to bedding planes) in the form of Thomsen parameters, in a symmetry model usually called TTI (tilted transverse isotropy). The final model consists of 5 spatially varying parameters:
