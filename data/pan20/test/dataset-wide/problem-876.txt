They could time the transit, which would last hours, with great precision. But they had to wait until the next transit of Venus in 1761. Then, observers observed the black drop effect, which made it very hard to time the event from start to finish precisely. 

The average angular diameter of the Moon, as seen from the Earth, is about 31 arcminutes. The angular diameter depends on the distance between the two objects and the diameter of the object being viewed. Specifically, for small angles, it is the diameter divided by the distance. When the distance is the same, the angular size is proportional to the diameter. The distance remains the same when viewing the Earth from the Moon, but the Earth is larger. According to NASA, the diameter of the Moon is 3,476 km, and the diameter of the Earth is 12,756 km. So, because it's proportional, the angular diameter can be calculated as follows: $a_{Earth} = a_{Moon} \times {d_{Earth}\over d_{Moon}}$ $ = 31 arcminutes \times {12,756 km \over 3,476 km}$ $ \approx 114 arcminutes$, or just under 2 degrees. This is approximate, because not only is this valid only for small degrees, where the tangent of an angle can be approximated by the angle itself (in radians), the Earth-Moon distance varies because the Moon's orbit around the Earth is an ellipse. 

tl;dr- Your moon's dimensions look pretty decent, but the lighting effect is causing your moon to be mostly dark and dim, causing it to appear even smaller. You could probably fix this pretty easily by adjusting the lighting model for the moon object. 

I checked your numbers; they match Wikipedia's. I made the scene you described in the question in a ray-tracer that I've created and haven't released (so we're definitely using different software). Compared the result to the picture provided in @Alchimista's answer, using the 60-degree camera angle they'd estimated for that picture and matched its dimensions. 

Our moons look like they might be of about the same dimension, except they're drawn differently. I drew mine as a 100% white light; any ray that hit it returned a perfectly white pixel. Yours looks mostly dark, with a specular highlight. However, a specular highlight isn't a good model for the moon; at least, not one as sharp as used in that scene. As can be seen in the overlay with the photo's moon, the real-life moon has a more reflective effect with a brighter region (though that'll vary with the phase of the moon, e.g. a full moon vs. the crescent-moon that appears in the photo). In short, the moon's probably going to look small without the typical scenery around it, though the choice of lighting effect makes it look yet smaller. 

Using the Earth-Moon distance and the separation of the Moon from the Sun in the sky when the Moon was at exactly half-phase, Aristarchus calculated the Earth-Sun distance. 

Incorrect. Even if the Earth had no axial tilt and the Moon had an equatorial orbit, that doesn't mean that every new moon would be a total solar eclipse. Yes, the moon would always generate some kind of an eclipse at every new moon, but it's orbit shape hasn't changed -- it's still an ellipse. It's further at some points in its orbit and closer at others. When it's further away at new moon, it appears smaller than the sun in the sky, making an annular (ring) eclipse, not a total eclipse. 

Generally not correct. Solar time is based on the average time it takes for the sun to cross the meridian (24 hours), and sidereal time is based on the time it takes for a star to cross the meridian. Sidereal time counts 24 "hours" in 23 hours, 56 minutes, and 4 seconds, meaning that it runs slightly faster than our normal solar time. There is one day in which solar and sidereal time are 12 hours off, on the northward equinox in March. The Sun is on the northward equinox, but solar time is measured since midnight where sidereal time is measured since passing the meridian (local noon). There is one day in which solar and sidereal time coincide, on the southward equinox in September. The Sun is on the southward equinox, 180 degrees in the sky from the northward equinox, so the 12 hours off from midnight and the Sun being 12 hours off from the northward equinox cancel. 

The stars between galaxies are called "intergalactic stars", and one study (2012) claims to have identified about 675 of them between the Milky Way and Andromeda: 

Ray-tracer didn't account for any atmospheric effects. Aimed the camera directly at the moon, whereas the picture had the moon a bit off-center. Ray-tracer used exactly 60-degrees for the horizontal view angle, but that was only an estimate for the camera's. Used numbers given in question for moon's distance/size. Presumably the moon wasn't at exactly that estimated average distance in the picture. The ray-tracer image and the picture used slightly different pixel heights/widths, since I eye-ball'd it. They were pretty close (overlayed the windows), but probably not exact. 

And here's an overlay, cropping out the parts of the moon in the photo that didn't fit into the ray-tracer's moon's frame: 

Here's the image of the moon I got (didn't put in the Earth; the stars in the background are randomly generated): 

Just to avoid confusion, I didn't actually use the shared photo file, but rather a screenshot of the photo. The relevant point there is that the pixel dimensions of the ray-traced image may not match the photo's pixel dimensions for this reason. Next, I overlaid your moon with a red-framed version of mine: 

This American Meteor Society resource seems also to indicate that meteorites can fall to the ground without being extremely hot. 

Generally, the closer you are to the equator, the more the sun would be covered. But this would vary slightly depending on the distance of the Moon from the Earth, and it wouldn't depend solely on your latitude. As Gerald points out, the moon's shadow, in which you would see a total solar eclipse, is cone-shaped. Different points on the Earth close to the equator would experience a different cross-section of the cone, which may be narrower or wider depending on your exact location. Where the eclipse is partial, the apparent size of the moon would control how much of the Sun is covered. A further-away moon would appear smaller in the sky and thus cover less of the Sun. Close to the borderline where the Moon appears to graze the Sun, the Moon may miss the Sun entirely if it's far enough and it appears small enough. 

For the same reason as (1), the path of totality would vary from a maximum amount down to nothing. For annular eclipses there would be a similar path of annularity instead. But whichever path it is would always be centered on the equator. 

There is a tentative detection of a GRB simultaneously with an FRB, DeLaunay et al 2016. If it is true, it would mean that at least some FRBs have the same origin as some GRBs. Theoretically many possibilities were suggested before and after this tentative, detection. For now they all remain quite speculative, and more observations are required (and planned) For some selection of models, it could be interesting to look into citations to this paper or its references. 

The interpretation you suggest in the second paragraph is incorrect. It is understandable, since there is a debate in the literature - different papers come to potentially contradicting conclusions. "Excluding a possibility that the event is associated with substantial gamma-ray radiation, directed towards the observer" simply means that no observable GRB is found, hinting that may be the original detection was caused by instrumental background: each detector has it's own instrumental backgrounds, only real events should be seen by all sufficiently sensitive instruments. In principle, it is always possible that the merger generated beamed emission, directed somewhere else. No instrument should have seen it directly, and there is no simple way to know if it happened. This upper limit is derived from the observation of another satellite (INTEGRAL/SPI-ACS, Savchenko et al 2016) than the original detection (Fermi/GBM, Connaughton et al 2016). Also an alternative analysis of the Fermi/GBM data (Greiner et al 2016) suggested that no event can be found in the GBM data - their opinion is that it was a background fluctuation of some kind. Right now, the teams who reported these conflicting results are working together, trying to come up with a consistent picture, which might be, in principle, a GRB with this or that properties associated with the GW150914, an unrelated GRB with some properties, or no detection whatsoever. This work is centered on cross-calibrating and comparing instruments, and is also useful to avoid these kind of uncertainties in the future. One could try to characterize the spectral properties of this event, following the approach of the original Fermi/GBM team. But unfortunately, the measurement appeared to be in very unlucky conditions for Fermi/GBM (in bad direction). Which is why the signal was very weak (below what would be usually reported for a real GRB, though recently the attempts were made to decrease these thresholds, see Goldstein et al 2017 ), and spectral characterization is loose. You can look for some details to Veres et al 2016. With these large uncertainties the spectrum is compatible to that of known short GRBs. The luminosity estimate depends on the spectrum, but is seems to be at the lower end of the short GRB sample (see e.g. Wanderman et al 2015) But because the uncertainties are large, the event, if real, might be unusual as well. The INTEGRAL observation, non-detection, would imply much softer (perhaps, unusual for a short GRB) or/and a weaker burst, possibly incompatible even with the highly uncertain Fermi/GBM data. Duration of this possible GRB possibly associated with GW event is the easy part and is about 1 s long, typical for a short GRB (Kouveliotou et al 1993). 

Any bacteria present in a meteor would not necessarily burn. According to the Bad Astronomer's "Bad Addendum" to another unrelated point, "A Meteoric Rise", meteors sure do get extremely hot, but that outside part usually ablates away, leaving the inner part that was extremely cold for who knows how long, which may not have warmed up much during the fall. 

Basically, Huygens used good methods, except for using "numerology and mysticism" to determine the size of Venus. He was lucky that Venus was almost the size of Earth; that made his estimate for the AU pretty close. Not long after, Cassini used the parallax of Mars to determine the AU. (Same article as linked above.) 

With respect to the Sun, the Earth rotates once every 24 hours. But because the Sun's apparent position changes in the sky due to Earth's revolution around the Sun, the Earth rotates once every 23 hours, 56 minutes, 4 seconds with respect to the stars. Because of this 3 minutes, 56 seconds difference, all stars rise and set 3 minutes, 56 seconds earlier each succeeding day. This applies to the time of a star passing through the meridian as well. So, on the next day, April 29, Arcturus will pass the meridian at 22:56:04.
