That would give a month's weight of food as around 38kg. That's less than the average weight of a person, by a factor of around 2. I would expect an average British person to be eating significantly more than the average for people worldwide. They could be eating less than the average for the US, but I doubt it is by a factor of 2. So no the claim is not strictly true. But an error by a factor of two is actually pretty good for a web comic, and might be just a case of artistic license 

It also says that the quote from Everett Koop (Surgeon General, alleged in the ACSA net article to have said "tobacco radiation is probably responsible for 90% of tobacco-related cancer") can't be tracked down (quoted on the web thousands of times, but no indication of when and on what programme he allegedly said it). 

It also lacks any explanation of how the alleged radiation could have caused these deaths. The usual statement has to be made about all such allegations:"correlation is not causation". The Canadian article is just a rant with no information. It doesn't even state whether the infant death rate went up before or after the Fukushima tragedy (which took place halfway through the period that article claims to have figures for). Against this is the truth that the amounts of radiation which reached the US (and Canada) were absolutely trivial. Here is an article giving some information: initial readings are "about a billion times beneath levels that would be health threatening." People who don't understand radiation often assume that "any radiation causes disease", forgetting that we are all subjected to much more radiation than reached North America from Japan just from natural sources.

NO, (or YES dependent on the definition of primary energy) as answer to the claim: "Wind power does not account for less than half a percent of total global energy usage in 2014." The wording of the report (from Jordys answer)indicates that they compared electrical output of renewables to the energy contents of combustibles. Putting these on the same graph can be wrong depending on the definition of primary energy. The caveat of this answer is that it is based on the definition of primary energy. The authors should have mentioned it, if they made the analysis while regarding the difference between primary and secondary energy for renewables. As they didn't, they most likely used the less favourable definition of primary energy with regard to renewables. 

The 'source' for the Wikipedia statement was a 'conspiracy theory' page of the Sonoma County Free Press. This isn't a reliable source for the claim by Wikipedia's standards, and the statement has since been removed from Wikipedia. This page is a pretty thorough debunking of claims about Bohemian Grove made by Alex Jones (gun nut and conspiracy theorist), which points out that Calvin Coolidge (Republican President 1923-29) was not a member. 

The repetition of the story by reputable news outlets who normally do a decent job fact checking. For example Fortune magazine, Science, The Independent The almost complete absence of right wing media pointing out that this is not true. You know if there was a way to be attacking the President on this they would be doing it. 

The pay of pilots covers a huge spectrum. Experienced plots for major airlines are well paid. However the pilots of regional airlines and commuter lines are sometimes paid much much less. This is partly because there is a glut of pilots right now, and also because pilots use these jobs as a way to gain the experience they need to be hired by the major airlines. This site (thanks erekalper) gives ranges of salaries. Note that some of them (hello United) go down to $21,000! Delta goes down to $35,000 and SkyWest to $45,000, neither a lot of money for someone who has had to undergo years of training and qualification and who literally has your life in their hands. The difference from airline to airline is also huge. This Wall Street Journal article (thanks fred) points out that the starting salary for US Airways is $21,000. Since they haven't been hiring for years there are no pilots on 'starting salary', but that's what they would get. The pilots of the Colgan Air plane that crashed into Buffalo were on about $24,000. So in short:Yes, it is perfectly possible that the guy piloting your plane could be earning a poverty wage. Make of that what you will. Non-airline commercial piloting jobs are paid even less, because they are the stepping stone to the junior airline positions (there is, incidentally, a licensing difference between an 'airline pilot' and a 'commercial pilot' - any reference to 'airline pilots' should exclude the guy flying a Piper Cub, even for money). (Technically some of the salaries in the first survey could be for a flight engineer, but flight engineers are a vanishing breed in these days of two-person cockpits.) 

Yes, there's some alien hunting going on. Detection Well, yes, money is being spent to search for intelligent aliens. The obvious case is SETI, the Search for ExtraTerrestrial Intelligence. Quoting from their mission statement, 

The important part there is (2): Detection. In terms of financial status, they are a 501(c)3 non-profit organization. They are, of course, fond of donations from people and corporations. So yes, they are spending money. Transmission The Arecibo Observatory is another famous player in the extraterrestrial contact arena. Their description of themselves is 

A NASA article says the same thing, using an actual airplane. The plane will bank and turn on the side with the aileron that is tilted up. This video shows the plane turning in the direction that has the aileron down. 

The whole idea seems like a load of rubbish, especially since the principles the experiment would be based on are extremely unsound. I'm quite skeptical about the claim, but I'm not fully convinced that it was fake, because there are claims that the ship's logs (which purportedly put the ship somewhere completely different, far from Philadelphia) were falsified. In short, there doesn't seem to be a neutral (i.e. not by the Navy or the original claimants) record of the actions of the U.S.S. Eldridge during this time period, which for me would be the clincher. At least, I can't find one. Did the Philadelphia Experiment ever take place? 

Mental exhaustion (also mental fatigue, mental stress) is certainly absolutely real, and in no way related to boredom or loss of motivation. In fact the opposite is usually the case - many studies relate mental exhaustion to a perceived inability to perform a task that they really want to perform. A significant instance is RAF fighter pilots during the Battle of Britain, who were frequently (and understandably) found to have a high level of mental exhaustion. Even at this stage they had a high level of motivation, and frequently had to be explicitly ordered, against their own request, to take a break before their fatigue caused them to become ineffective. Some studies on the subject: 

While it is possible that the ABC poll mentioned may have had flaws, ABC is an experienced polling organization. It is unlikely that it has made an error of tens of percents in the estimates. The given percentage is 61, with a margin of error of about 3%. This is in line with other polls. This one gives 54% as the number who believe in a six-day creation. This one gives 55%. This one says 40%. This one says 66%. So while the precise figure is hard to determine, and probably depends on the question, is is clearly true that something in the region of half of Americans believe in the literal truth of Genesis. And by implication Noah's Ark. 

I came across this article, with another picture of the plane in mid-flight. The flaps are in the same positions (their red circles in the following picture, not mine): 

Addendum Six months after this question was asked, Batygin & Brown (2016) (arXiv) showed indirect evidence for the existence of a ninth planet with a semi-major axis of ~700 AU and an eccentricity of ~0.6, swinging it as close as 200 AU to the Sun and as far as 1200 AU away from it. As of several months after the paper's publication, no direct evidence of Planet 9 has been found (as expected), but the Subaru Telescope is expected to play a major role in the search for it. Hopefully, observational data can support the models in the years to come - within five years, perhaps, according to Brown. The new results aren't quite the same as the results of de la Fuente Marcos & de la Fuente Marcos (2014), which are cited in the question (and in the paper by Batygin & Brown). For example, the original claim posits a planet with a semi-major axis at ~200 AU, in addition to another planet with a semi-major axis at ~250 AU, in a 3:2 resonance. Furthermore, Batygin & Brown explicitly address and criticize the results of de la Fuente Marcos & de la Fuente Marcos and the similar studies by Trujillo & Sheppard (2014) (pdf here), who proposed the use of the Kozai mechanism as an orbiting body is perturbed by another body with a greater semi-major axis. In particular, they note that the orbits of the two planets would have to have orbital parameters within a small range of values. Also, another large body (e.g. a passing star) would likely have been required, which would have produced effects that conflict with observations. 

As is often the case, Snopes has already looked at this. A large march in Poland did take place on 11th November 2015, but it was well reported in mainstream media. Numbers were less than 150,000 and not all were protesting Muslim immigration. Reports on the attendance at the march vary, with organizers claiming 50,000, and police 25,000. The march was widely reported: 

Here is an interesting article that seems to back up your friend's claims. The article says that bus occupancy is about 9, and car occupancy about 1.57, and cites a study that buses are more polluting than cars at these figures. 

The figures of around 50% 'not sure' is fairly constant across all the Republican primary supports, with the happy exception of George Pataki, whose supporters returned a 100% 'not sure'. Presumably George Pataki scores high among people who listen to questions and know the names of countries. The 50% 'not sure' is also fairly constant across all other demographics. 

Starting with two sexually mature rats (and assuming averages of all the above throughout), the original pair will produce 7 litters of 8 rats in a year - 56 rats. The first litter in the second generation become fertile at 4 months after birth (5 months from the start of the year), and so the four females in that litter will have around 7/12*7 = 4 litters each in the year - 128 rats. 128 + 56 = 184. That's so close to the 200 that we don't need to worry about the remaining 6 litters or further generations. Rats are clearly capable of becoming at least 200 within a year. 

Supporting claims based on primary and secondary energy definitions (NO as answer) Primary energy (1,3) is the energy contained in a fuel. So to speak the released heat in perfect combustion. Unburnt fuel is part of many energy conversion cycles. It is not the generated useful energy. Non-Fuel based primary energy would be the input to the system, not the generated useful energy. For wind turbines this would be the energy contained in the wind, a perfect wind turbine can only get around 60% of the winds energy (Betz's law). For solar we have around 15-20% conversion efficiency. Therefore the primary energy of renewables is many times higher than the listed numbers. Secondary energy (1,3) is the energy of energy carriers, these are for example fuels and electricity. Fuel can be an input for electricity generation, so even there are subclasses regarding the quality of the secondary energy. (Oil would be primary, gasoline a secondary energy in some regards, even though we don't use all of the energy in gasoline either) Exaggerated alternative data (just to make a point) Primary solar energy heats the earth during the whole year, if we assume that heating needs(relative to the avg temperature of space of a few Kelvin) are met by solar power, we get about 99.9+% (didn't calculate it actually) of the primary energy in solar. Counterargument (YES as answer) A claim arguing that the definition of primary energy is usually as probably envisioned by the authors of the Energy Report, from Ref 3: 

So the claim is really only supported in one region of the brain, not all regions. Note the phrasing here. It doesn't say that there are more connections between hemispheres in one gender and more connections inside hemispheres in the other gender, but rather that strength is different. Not necessarily number. The article only tells half of the truth. Consider it untruthful. The image, by the way, is from Figure 2 of the paper. The caption reads: 

Whether or not this is evolution is open to interpretation. It sounds a lot like it, and though the processes Chuang Tzu describes aren't the evolutionary mechanisms we theorize about today, they're remarkably similar to Darwinian evolution in the relationship between species; i.e. one insect being directly connected to another insect, but being indirectly connected to, say, a human. Chuang Tzu is also referred to as Zhuang Zhou, a name you mentioned. Could Zhuang Zhou (aka Zhuangzi) be Tson Tse? Zhuang Zhou lived in the 4th and 3rd centuries B.C., two centuries ahead of the hypothetical Tson Tse. Yet Nehru says that Tson Tse lived at the same time as the Buddha, whose lifetime is not yet entirely established - he may have lived partly in the 4th century B.C. Nehru could have been mistaken about the date, and even the name of the philosopher - as Wikipedia says (emphasis mine):
