You may run into some poor shifting performance, but the system should still function. If you are unhappy with the performance, 8 speed chainrings will mount on your current crankset, so there's no need to change-up everything. 

The most important thing is to make sure your core temperature is high enough. As your body begins to chill, it pulls blood away from the extremities, to maintain its core temp. Often times cyclists will think "my core temperature feels fine, but my hands are cold" so they think they need warmer gloves, when in reality they need another jacket/vest/jersey/base layer. Also, remember body heat is generated in your torso, and has to be piped to your hands. If, for example, you were riding with bare arms, and giant oven-mitt gloves, your hands would still get cold, because the blood would have lost too much of its heat before ever reaching your hands. Again, long-sleeved jacket/jerseys, base layers, and arm warmers can all help significantly with keeping hands warm. Good gloves are important to keeping your hands warm, but they're just one part of the chain, and if any of the pieces are missing, not even the thickest, warmest gloves in the world will stop your hands from getting cold. 

These would maintain the flat portion allowing you to keep your current brake levers, but would give you a more extended position on the horns (similar to riding the hoods of a drop bar or a flat bar with bar ends.) There are bar-end levers that work quite well with these bars if you so choose. Alternatively, you could experiment with adding bar ends on your current bar. Drop bars (curly in your question?) come in a few different shapes and widths - some are more comfortable in the drops and others more comfortable on the hoods of your brakes. This will likely require a brake lever upgrade, but such is life. From top to bottom: classic road, randonneur, ergonomic, track: 

The only time I've seen pedals in a newish bike strip out of the crank was when the mechanic who assembled the bike overtightens the pedals (the mechanic was a younger me, but you live and you learn.) Often, people will forget that left pedals are left-hand threaded and will strip them out when they try to remove them. The mechanical motion of pedaling causes metal-metal mating surfaces to fret - microscopic motion back and forth causing noticeable wear. If this were a bike from the 70's with aluminum cranks it wouldn't be a surprising failure mechanism. However, since these are new bikes, the most likely explanation is that who ever assembled these bikes tightened the pedals too much. There is no way a child could be riding the bicycle enough to cause a pedal to strip out. To have it happen three times is incredibly unlikely, though. I'd avoid buying department store bikes and refer to your local bike shop for any repairs or replacements. 

As I see it, you have two main options. The first is that you buy new/better brakes, the second is that you adjust the cable tension so that the brakes function correctly in the "open" position. This will kill the "quick release" functionality, but should otherwise function correctly. 

That dimension refers to the depth of the rim. See this article on some particular carbon rims, that includes a cross-sectional diagram. Deeper wheels tend to be more aerodynamic, though they are heavier, and handle worse in crosswinds. Thus, different rim depths are more suitable for different types of races. 88mm rims are almost exclusively used in time trials and triathlons, while shallow rims will be more popular for races with lots of climbing. For riders without the luxury of multiple wheelsets, 38-60mm seems to be the standard depth. The life span of carbon rims (or any rim, for that matter) depends greatly on the type of riding done. Typically, a wheel will need to be replaced because the braking surface has worn down. This means that the wheel's longevity is dependent on the type of riding done. Long descents with lots of braking will accelerate the wear. Riding in the rain will accelerate the wear. Keeping the brake pads and rims clean will increase the longevity. Also, some carbon wheels have carbon braking surfaces, which are more sensitive, while others have aluminum braking surfaces, which are more durable. So I am hesitant to give an exact number, but I'd say a reasonably-well maintained wheelset should probably last 10,000-20,000 miles. 

As tools a I just have the basics, when i search for freewheel remover I see hundreds of different things like this: 

I wasn't really happy with the brakes so I decided to search for a good used ones. I found a good offer for the shimano 7800 BR and bought them. I installed the front one without problems but the rear one is being a nightmare. The problem: When I try to install the shimano brakes one pad reaches perfectly the rim but the other one (opposite side than the cable) does not reach the rim and collides with the rubber of the tire. I can't find which model of brakes did the bike had, I can only see the brand written and it says promax. Here are some photos of the two brakes: 

And here the brake pad reaches the rim if I have a little angle between the bridge and the brake, but I can tighten the brake in that position: Is there anything I can do to install this brakes in this bike? 

You're right on the money in terms of commuting upgrades. Buying used bikes is a great way to go about acquiring a ride, but sometimes bikes need a bit of refitting for commuting. I took a look at the 1981 Miyata Catalog. Models from year to year are generally similar, so this should be accurate for most late 70s early 80s 912s. This bike is described as a "fast sport rider for racing-oriented cyclists," meaning that it isn't going to fit fat tires, fenders, or racks too easily. What is important is the distance between the tire and the frame. You may be able to get away with a 700c x32 tire and narrow, metal fenders. Metal fenders are a bit more expensive than plastic, but can be bent to fit into tight places. Note that most fender manufacturers specify 10mm clearance between the tire and the fender, so as to prevent a pebble or twig from tearing your fenders off. There may or may not be braze-ons for fenders or racks, but that is easy to get around. Lots of bike shops sell metal clamps that secure everything to the stays quite well. If you're comfortable with the largest possible tire being ~32mm, go for it! Understand, however, that bikes designed for skinny tires and no fenders may be difficult to fit. If you decide not to, look for Touring or Sports-Touring models which always have clearance and braze-ons (In this catalog, the 1000 and 610 are both touring models). One alternative option that will require more work is to convert the wheel size from 700c to 650b. This will involve new wheels and long-reach brakes, but it will allow you to run fatter tires and fenders with no issues. 

As long as you're not adding larger cogs than you've got on right now, your existing chain should be a functional length. One more thing to consider is that if your current chain has significant wear, running it with a new cassette can damage the cassette (effectively very rapidly turning your "new" cassette into your "old" cassette), so even though your old chain should work fine with your new cassette, it may be worth it to replace it anyway. 

How long a tire lasts depends on a number of factors, including what type of tires you ride, how much you weigh, the conditions you ride in, front vs rear tire, etc. In general, a good set of tires will last a couple thousand miles. When the tire is totally worn out, you can usually see threads beneath the rubber in places. Alternatively, the tire may start to bulge in spots. In practice, road tires rarely get to this point. Much more commonly, they start accumulating a lot of cuts from glass and other debris in the road. When you start getting disproportionately many flats, it's a good idea to replace the tire (you can use the tire longer, but you'll probably waste more than a new tire's cost in tubes). 

I can't see what is wrong with the new ones, that doesn't allow the right side to reach the rim, because the height of both seems to be the same. The width of the tyre (28) should not be the problem as the front one works perfectly There is a washer that was in the old brakes but does't make any difference for this problem if I put it or not. To show better the problem. This is the bridge: 

As I learned in this question, the cog of my freewheel are damaged and should be replaced. I've been searching for some information but I'm still not sure of what I need. At the beginning I though I just needed to search for a cog like this with 1/8" like my chain: 

But reading the description it seems like it's only for fixed gears, so I was completely worng. Searching for more items under the single speed category in the website everything looked like that. What do I need to buy as replacement? This is how what I have now: 

BMX style platform pedals are super popular and work for lots of people. The cheaper ones are probably the most affordable/functional pedals out there. These pedals range from fat and chunky plastic to graceful CNC aluminum (and there are lots of garish colors out there for those into color-coordination.) Some of these pedals have provisions for reflectors and most allow for strap-type foot retention (but not toe clips.) The more expensive pedals will have sealed bearings, but you generally get what you pay for. The big benefit of this style of pedal is that they have a nice flat platform with lots of grip. Metal platforms frequently have pins set into the tops to add grip which, if you've ever ridden these pedals in shorts, leads to frequent bloody shins (so avoid expensive pants or delicate leg skin.) Cruisers and utility bikes will sometimes have plastic or composite pedals with rubberized tops that don't tear your shins into ribbons. I have a set of VP 001 Thin Gripsters and they're great for commuting and hauling around town. They do have sharp little nubbins, but I can deal with it as they're really shine in the rain and snow. They're noticeably thinner than other platforms (hence the name) but they're wide and long so I never misstep. The big drawback to these pedals is that they're heavy and wide (plus the bloody shins, but I covered that.) The weight is a compromise in any case, but the width can sometimes be a real problem i.e. a low bottom bracket with long cranks will dig your pedal into the pavement while cornering. Similarly, riding a bike with lots of toe overlap on the front wheel will lead to endless suffering in tight places. These can be avoided with careful maneuvering but will surprise the unawares. 

Perhaps your best option is Gear Finder provided by Bicycling Magazine. They have various bikes organized by type, price, and some sub-details. As for why you don't see the same types of databases that you see for computer products, this is because the people who actually make these things (computer programmers) are much more likely to be interested in computers (as a product) than bicycles. 

Wear proper cycling shorts under your chamois-free tights. This provides you with an additional layer of warmth without sacrificing the protection a chamois provides. Buy leg warmers to complement your cycling shorts. Leg warmers are just an insulated sleeve that goes over your leg and runs from the ankle to just below the crotch. When you say you spotted other cyclists wearing tights under their shorts, it is much more likely that they were only wearing leg warmers. This provides them with the added leg protection, without a layer of material in between their body and the chamois. Buy tights with a chamois. These are designed to fully replace your shorts, rather than complement them. 

I have a singlespeed with a flipflop hub to change to fixed gear. In my freewheel sprocket I have 16 teeth and in the ring chain 46 teeth. For me this is almost always the perfect combination for touring where I live. But sometimes I want to go up a mountain (15-17% ) and I,m not strong enough to keep pedaling. I,d like to have the fixie side as backup for those occasions with more teeth. I don't have any local shop to try gear ratios so I have t guess and buy. Is there any method to guess how many more teeth do I need considering what I already have? I can go around 15km/h in a 7%hill. 

I've been using the last year thickslicks to driver mainly inside my city and I usually tried to don't go through anything else but asphalt to prevent punctures. I've been wondering if going through a rocky path (or something similar with lot of little rocks) with thickslicks (700x28) and pressure around 100psi is more likely to get a puncture than the traditional wider and with tread tires that most MTB bikes have. Example with no tread: 

As a cyclist who had a hard time getting comfortable on road geometry with drop handlebars, I will recommend that you ride as many different bikes as possible for a long time before you consider dropping money on a "custom" bike. Considering frame material and construction, geometry quirks, wheel sizes, brake types, drivetrain compatibility, tire clearance, frame lifespan, braze-ons, so on and so forth....there are LOTS of different bikes out there. To illustrate this, consider: 

You can purchase suspension-corrected rigid forks which are designed to work with the geometry that suspended frames offer (Essentially the axle-crown measurement places the head tube where it needs to be. Pretty simple.) There are a few manufacturers out there, but my favorite is Surly (in terms of quality and in value. They offer several forks for 26"-29" with disc and canti options.) 

Safe is a relative term in this instance. A shirt might protect you in a fall, but only just. You'll know immediately whether a shirt can protect your skin from sticks, branches, and prickers dangling into the trail. If you were going fast enough flying insects may even make an impact, though I can't imagine it'd be terribly painful. Shirts do offer some protection from two things: sunburns (and subsequent skin cancer) and bites from insects (potentially carrying disease.) For lightly complexioned people, skin cancer is a huge danger and can develop even without having been sunburned. Insect-borne diseases are also a big deal in most places. Having been treated for Lyme disease, I can attest to the importance of wearing insect repellent and, yes, shirts. Additionally, that thin layer of material actually keeps you cooler by blocking the sun from reaching your skin - this is the same reason why desert dwelling peoples wear lightweight material all over their bodies. Having a shirt on also keeps you from sweating all over your bike and other gear. In terms of etiquette: if you're out in the woods and there aren't many people around, go for it. If you're bumping elbows with people on a multi-use trail, maybe consider some modesty.
