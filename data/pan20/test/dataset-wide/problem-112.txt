We can't say. A parrot can realistically mimic a can opener, an opera singer, cats and dogs and doorbells, Piano riffs and human speech. Not to mention the calls of other birds! Parrots don't have big brains, their tongues are not as prehensile as ours; their lips and cheeks are not flexible, they have no teeth to brace a tongue against. We use all those to form sounds like "P", "G", "T", "SSHHH", etc: Parrots accomplish all those with vocal gymnastics in the throat, not the mouth, and we humans cannot tell the difference. Which means a "standard" vocal tract already shared by most animals is probably enough. The real changes are in the brain, in two parts. First is the ability to hear a sound and (somehow) translate that into whatever complex series of muscle controls would produce it. We hear a new word, and usually in a single try can produce that word. Not so for other sounds; for us. But a parrot can hear a doorbell, and it's brain translates that into muscular controls that reproduce it so well it fools humans. (Yes, they have perfect pitch too, so even more neural equipment on the hearing side). That is about inputs; The second area of the brain is obviously that masterful control center of the output side: The vocal tract itself; timing and fine control over the shape of the throat and tongue, air pressures, pitch, tone and volume required to reproduce sounds with such precision and accuracy, and speed of changes. Exactly what changes are required in the brain are impossible to describe; we truly do not know that much. But you can be certain there are genes to lay down this neural machinery: The proof is in the pudding, Parrots can speak perfect Chinese, Russian, and English. Squirrels suck at Chinese! Which means, Logan, give the animals a voice box with muscular control, and you are set. The neural machinery can fit in a parrot's cute little head, the necessary nerves and muscles can fit in their little throat. 

Actual hunter-gatherers in the Australian Outback find berries (sugar is a carb) and various kinds of root vegetables (similar to potatoes, carrots, etc) and even leaf and stem vegetables that can be boiled to palatability. Also, wild honey is pure sugar. Added: Presumably nomadic herders can do the same to get some carbohydrates. If they have human levels of intelligence, they can also recognize a root vegetable from its leaves; spot a wild honeycomb (the honey won't rot), or see wild melons, squash, etc. Even nomads tend to follow a circuit and have temporary encampments at a feeding and watering spot; so they may know the area and what to look for. That said, I don't think carbohydrates are medically necessary at all; many fishing hunter-gatherers have lived exclusively on protein and fat, like the Inuit used to do with whale meat and blubber. Humans can do that indefinitely and, as in the Atkin's diet, it can deliver many beneficial effects. In fact one of the medical 'cancer' diets is an extreme ketogenic diet with near-zero carbohydrates (See e.g Ketogenic Diets by Kossoff,Freeman,Turner,Rubenstein (all MDs); or "Cancer as a Metabolic Disease" by Thomas Seyfried; a medical tome detailing the chemistry behind why such diets work). This diet is also routinely prescribed to lessen the frequency and severity of epileptic seizures, and other forms of seizures. 

Geckos can walk up walls, glass, on ceilings, etc due to Van der Waals forces: See $URL$ These are not gravity, or glue, or secretions; it is inter-molecular forces; and in fact are strong enough to counter-act Earth gravity for a relatively heavy creature. The same could apply to creatures in a weightless environment; and there is good reason for that to be done. Although "swimming" through air is an option (birds and insects do it), it takes a lot of energy. Being able to stick to a surface is useful. Being able to walk on one; like a gecko, could be useful too. Static electricity often causes floating objects to stick to surfaces; and some of these have calories. So surfaces may be where small insects alight to hunt for those calories; and being able to wait for such insects without expending any energy and eat them is a useful adaptation. I'm not sure what your goal is; but the Van der Waals forces that can keep a gecko upside down on the ceiling have been, in experiments, scaled up to hold 200 lb men on the ceiling, and that is against Earth gravity. Presumably it would be pretty easy, in a weightless environment, to stick to any surface if normal sized human feet and/or hands had evolved the tiny gecko hairs that allow geckos to stick to surfaces. The writing job is to find a plausible reason for walking such surfaces; but I think you (the OP) already have something in mind. 

That doesn't stop the Druids, with healing magic. How powerful or fast is the healing magic? Is it a weapon itself, in war? I have shot both a regular bow and a crossbow, it is not instantly easy to hit the bullseye with it. So while a bolt to the head of a druid might kill it; that is a small target, and can be protected by a shield or helmet. Suppose along with healing, druids can also magically turn off pain in war: They might as well, any injuries are going to be healed anyway, and any damage caused to their bodies by ignoring pain will be magically disappeared as well. Unlike the Europeans, make the Druids extremely hard to kill; it isn't enough to put a bolt in their heart and move on; put ten bolts in them and they are still coming at you with an axe like its a minor inconvenience. A European soldier could get so used to Griffins as to not think of them as magic, but the Druids in war could seem unstoppable. 

If you are looking for "most likely", the answer is most likely physics. Genes are instructions for forming proteins and guiding the combinations of proteins into larger structures. That's it! All the sci-fi that attributes magical powers to "genes" or "Mutations" (like the series "Heroes", or the series "Zoo" which say mutations can cause telekinesis) are just trying to avoid saying it is magic, when it is. So the attribute it to something few people understand, genetics. Just like crystal power and pyramid power folk are attributing magical powers to "quantum action" and "fields". Of course, genes can create structures that use physics; my own brain is sending electrical signals to my fingers, with precise timing and force to activate muscles that cause a physical change in the world; pressing keys to type these words. Genes formed my eyes which are reacting, by the laws of physics (which for argument's sake encompasses all of bio-electric chemistry), to form images that help guide the firing of those muscles. But it is implausible to suggest things as large as cells are going to have any kind of ability to generate the power and precision necessary to break spacetime and do something on a macroscopic scale like move a body through another dimension. Any ability to enter a different reality would have to be currently unknown physics. Still magic, of course, but not as dumb a handwave as "genetics." Physics can plausibly operate on a subatomic scale, focus energy, or better yet, signal a much larger and more powerful machine, even one powered by a star or black hole, to create a dimensional rift that would be safe to pass through. As we already know, devices can be incredibly small. So Thor can get to Asgard because some insanely advanced technology is embedded innocuously in something like a ring, medallion, armband, or in the handle of his hammer, and when he wants to open the portal this device sends a signal to Asgard which commands a planet-sized machine to create a portal he can step through. Of course even Thor doesn't have to know how it works; his people may have found this billion year old tech left behind by aliens long ago, and learned to use it. 

It is virtually impossible to do without a complete map of every neuron (100 billion of them) and synapse connecting neurons (up to 1000 trillion of them). See Here for a description of the biology of human memory. Then you must have the ability to rewrite all of those, physically breaking and reforming synaptic connections in the brain. The brain is not a computer with a blank slate of hardware that can contain data, knowledge, programming or instructions. What we are in personality or knowledge or skill is 100% encoded in the physical arrangement of cells, the precise way neurons fire and activate other neurons due to physical wiring from one to the next; those physical wires connect through synapses where one neuron 'touches' another (with a small gap for atoms of chemicals to flow between them). To know something new requires a rewiring of this tangled mess, a literal growing process like growing vines. There is no PLACE in the brain to "download" anything, even when you hear a sound it is converted into electrical stimulation of cells, that fire if they recognize the pattern to stimulate other cells, and eventually stimulate cells to reconfigure their connections (synapses) so you know something new. Worse than that, HOW you know something is unique to you and your experiences. What you think of when I say "car" is unique to you and your lifetime of experiences with cars. For non-English speakers it may mean nothing, for a car designer or mechanic it may mean far more. This is because in your lifetime your brain has developed a "model", encoded in neurons and synapses, of what a "car" is, how they differ, the appearances, how they work, and so on. Any new thing for you to learn about cars has to fit into your existing model and modify your existing tens of thousands of neurons and millions of synapses devoted to your current understanding of cars, AND how cars link to everything else in your life. Even if we had the tech to map the neurons and synapses (we don't), that is just analogous to a microscope, seeing them is not enough. We don't have anything remotely close to being able to manipulate the brain or create a new synapse, certainly not without surgery. There will never be a high speed download of data, or skills, or knowledge to the brain. Thinking and learning will not get faster than the biological limits. That said, you CAN train your brain, through exercises, to remember far more than most people do naturally, learn faster, read far faster, and so on. Speed reading is a real thing, people really can train their brain to read and recite a book, and so on. 

Those two things are contradictory; pacifism is more advanced. Nearly all animals (including humans) have a natural inclination toward violence for securing their "survival goods" (food, water, shelter, hunting territory); it is why we have been at constant war in one place or another for literally all of history. A pacifist nation has a moral philosophy against the use of violence, which your aggressive nation does not have. That points to a cohesive (not disparate) and advanced (not primitive) religion, like Buddhism or the "turn the other cheek", "give him your coat", and "render unto Caesar what is Caesar's" form of Christianity. I would not assume your pacifists are just cowards, afraid to fight. That is contrary to human nature, especially the behavior of young men that are more rebellious and ready to prove themselves to win status and females. (I am not being sexist; this is basic human psychology across many cultures.) So unlike other answers here, I will be contrarian: I think your setup makes it much less likely a region will convert in the time frame allowed. People that subscribe to pacifism so strongly they'd rather be conquered than fight are not going to ditch that for a new religion that allows violent coercion in just 10 years. Violent coercion is what they have been regarding for a lifetime as primitive, it is why we call such violent conquerers "barbaric" and "brutal" and "beastly". How to fix it. Get rid of the pacifism. They can be fractious tribes with poor organization and mistrust of each other; with perhaps uneasy truces between them. Each tribe can have its own local versions of religious beliefs, including the knowledge that they are the only few thousand people that believe their particular version, making it much more likely, after being militarily conquered, that they will ditch their religion and 'join the crowd', believe what the hundreds of thousands or millions believe. As for the conquering nation; they can equate openly preaching heresy (against the State religion) with rebellion that is punishable by death. They don't have to punish private practice at all, and can even say so: Religions whither and die quickly if they cannot be publicly practiced; for a variety of reasons in human psychology, including wanting to fit in socially. If everybody is going to church for the State religion, others want to go too. Whatever religion exists in the conquered regions to start, make it actually primitive: violent, bloody, and above all, fractured into a hundred similar but disagreeing factions in different towns and regions, even to the point of mutual hate or demonizing each other's beliefs. This will make them reluctant to put aside their differences, and thus too slow to cooperate in repelling an invader. You implement something like this, from Martin Niemöller:
