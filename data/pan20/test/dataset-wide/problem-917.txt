There are several options -- which makes sense, as this is a story which explores the idea of infinity. The Library is spherical Immediately following the line "I say that the Library is unending", the narrator says: 

Together, the two themes are extremely intriguing, because they are in tension with another. If robots are, in some way, human, they cannot be anticipated and controlled. And to the extent that they follow logic to whatever conclusion it lead them, then they are clearly something other than human. There are many ways for these themes to conflict and interact. One example is Reason, where a robot believes he is a prophet, and comes up with bizarre, mystical explanations for the world it observes. Clearly, this robot is behaving irrationally, and in some ways in a very human way -- but the protagonists observe it is still following the Three Laws, so it is being both robotic and human at the same time. This, of course, hints at what further tension could develop if the robot's irrational, human-like beliefs didn't happen to dovetail so nicely with what the humans wanted the robots to do anyway. 

The dragon is a metaphor for Death, particularly by old age and by disease. This ties directly into Grey's previous recent video, "Why Die?", where he makes the same argument but without the metaphor. By providing a manifestation, a dragon "responsible" for death, and people accepting its inevitability, Bostrom argues that the world has accepted the fact of Death as inevitable, even when that might no longer be the case. Bostrom himself writes, in the original text: 

I think the disconnect may derive from regarding Shakespeare's plays as being written literature. The publication of the text versions of his play, whether in the the First Folios, the quartos, or any later form, were subsequent to the performance of the work. Although Shakespeare is potentially more widely read than any other poet, this method of engaging in is work is always secondary. The poetry of Shakespeare's plays is meant to be spoken. Thus, the metric problems you refer to would have been non-issues: 

Ruthlessness for sure. Ruthlessness can appear sadistic, but with sadism, the intent is to cause suffering for the purpose of pleasure/satisfaction. With ruthlessness, the goal is to achieve an outcome. A sadist can be ruthless in how they approach their sadism, but not all ruthlessness is sadistic in intent. I found nothing in the books to indicate that Gale is sadistic, only that he is angry about the condition of the districts, and willing to kill without remorse to achieve the goal of overthrowing the established order. Gale is a soldier. The job of the soldier is to kill without remorse, with the most effective means available. Gale's ruthlessness, his willingness to kill for expedience,* is a factor in her choosing Peeta over Gale. Katniss, a hunter as opposed to a soldier, kills only when necessary for survival. 

Humanity's control and understanding of the technology it has created. Non-human life, and the capacity of life which simulates humanity to feel and be human. 

The stories of I, Robot - and Asimov's robot stories in general - tend to circle around two central themes: 

Daniel Handler's A Series of Unfortunate Events, written under his Lemony Snicket pseudonym, delves into a great many intriguing themes -- the blindness and dysfunctionality of modern society; living with uncertainty and incomplete information; the ambiguity of moral judgments; society's tendency to clash and schism. These themes are constant and developed throughout the series. In addition, there is a very distinct tone that Handler maintains in all his Snicket work -- quirkiness, idiosyncrasy, and dark, deadpan humor. Do Handler's work aimed for adults, have similar themes and/or tone? Or are they extremely different, in nature? 

"Lord of the Flies" is a direct reference to Beelzebub (from the Hebrew ba'al z'vuv, בעל זבוב, literally "lord of flies.") Beelzebub is well known as a dark god, a demon, or another name for Satan himself. The clear implication, in the context of the book, is that humanity -- freed of restraints, left to its own devices -- will naturally tend to cruel and hellish behavior; that people are devils, if given the chance. 

Not in terms of what might incite the sub-optimal condition of war, which, in some cases, can be justified, but that many events and many deaths can be regarded as senseless (i.e. having no good reason.) The reason I focus on this as the simple answer is that the death in question occurs after victory has been achieved. It's senseless because there is no reason to continue the fighting. This is compounded in that the victims in this case were non-combatants. For parallels, I might look at Sam Fuller's The Big Red One, based on Fuller's experiences in WWII. (The opening scene touches on this very subject.) This is also a major theme of the more recent Letters from Iwo Jima. 

Is a restatement of a very old philosophical question in Christianity. Here I think it could refer to his faith in love, on a transcendental level, but the need for confirmation on a physical level. 

With each section divided by a plot point. It is important to note that the three-act structure is mostly associated with story arcs in cinema in the contemporary landscape. Wikipedia lists it exclusively as a structure utilized in film and television. Despite the potentially hyperbolic title of this page, it is nevertheless an extremely insightful and useful analysis. The reason you won't find much on three-act structure in plays is because number of acts in any given play is quite variable. Modern and contemporary playwrights, dating to at least Ibsen, experiment with different act structures. A good playwright can find a way to structure their story regardless of the act structure, as is demonstrated by many works considered masterpieces with structures beginning at one act and proceeding upwards from there. Contemporary dramaturges regularly alter the "breakup" of longer plays, as the contemporary theater tend to avoid productions with more than a single intermission. Thus a "five-act" Shakespeare play is commonly presented in two halves, with a single intermission. I put "five-acts" in quotes because this structure is a later innovation, not present in Elizabethan, or even Jacobean, drama in any formal sense. 

So, yes, those languages should not technically exist within the Library. But the Library is a dazzling thought experiment; not a "real" or rigorously-speculated world. In the service of the thought experiment, real languages serve Borges far better than imaginary ones could. 

This is a community-wiki answer where we can compile a list of names and their meanings. Tai-kun, Japanese. This name has a double meaning: "Tai-kun," as written, is applying the "-kun" suffix for "boy" or "young man" to the name or nickname "Tai." This is consistent with the book's description: 

The later quote is much more straightforward -- it's clear that we're talking about somebody being analogous to God, and not actually being God itself. The statement here is that, somewhere in the infinity of the library, there must exist a perfect and accurate index. The Librarian who stumbles across it may be no different or better than any other Librarian -- but by having discovered the true index, he will be able to find anything in the Library he desires. This, in this story, is akin to Godhood. This is a complex and unusual view of godhood -- one in which godhood is a thing of beauty and inspiration, the idea of finding order in chaos, and also almost impossible to touch or come near, because the library is so vast that the god, or the book, cannot be found. 

FOOTNOTES: [A] Looking upward to God was very famously reinforced by Donne in the Holy Sonnets "Thou Hast Made Me, And Shall Thy Work Decay": "I dare not move my dim eyes any way, / Despair behind, and death before doth cast / Such terror, and my feebled flesh doth waste / By sin in it, which it towards hell doth weigh. / Only thou art above, and when towards thee / By thy leave I can look, I rise again;" Eliot wrote a book on The Varieties of Metaphysical Poetry which discusses Dante and Donne. I don't know if the title is intentionally a reference to William James' earlier and highly influential The Varieties of Religious Experience, but it seems not unlikely. [B] "And Jesus went into the temple of God, and cast out all them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers, and the seats of them that sold doves, And said unto them, It is written, My house shall be called the house of prayer; but ye have made it a den of thieves."  Matthew 21:12–13 [C] The linked image depicts a vintage Mallory Stetson derby bowler hat. I personally like to think that Eliot, who was originally American, and would have certainly been aware of the gunslingers mythos of the Old West, was using that term to give a sort of frontier feel. Modern financialism, and financialism in general, has always been, in part, about "pushing the envelope". (Successfully pushing the envelop includes management of risk.) [D] Baudelaire uses “mon semblable”, translated as “my fellow” by Google. “Semblable” in English means “counterpart” or “equal”. In contemporary English, semblance is typically used in a pejorative sense, as in “similar in appearance but not in reality”, but the traditional usage is simple “resemblance”. [E] Achilles "mania" is generally translated, not improperly, as “rage” and “wrath”, but I think in this context, the direct rendering of the greek μῆνιν (mania) is more instructive. Here mania can mean obsession, excessive exuberance, overactivity detrimental to one's health, (Achilles' mania has fatal consequences;) [F] The dread of having one's body unburied and defiled is related to its shamefulness in an honor culture. [G] From Euripides' Hecuba: 

So, the Purifiers are a form of destructive, narrow-minded zealotry. They destroy items of inner beauty, while on a quest that sounds attractive, but upon deeper understanding, is utterly futile. And now we reach the Crimson Hexagon: 

But L, throughout the story and backstory both, is removed from the action. She's often mentioned as a quiet voice of reason, and a twist near the end has her hand in it -- but it seems we never really learn who L is, what her relationship to Cosey was, and why it is that she alone has such insight. What do we actually know about L? Is any justification for her uniqueness given -- do we get any sense of why she is a reliable guide and narrator, when all the other characters are wrapped up in their flaws and histories? What structural or thematic role does her character fulfill in the book? 

A connection to Romeo and Juliet would never have occurred to me -- they aren't forbidden lovers; they don't seem to be breaking social or cultural barriers; they don't seem to share any of Romeo and Juliets iconic traits or contrast with them (in anything but youthful, sexual passion). But the character names seem heavily suggestive, and Showalter clearly found a link. Is there a significant comparison to be drawn here? 

I don't think this is a prophecy about Psyche's fate so much as a cryptic prophecy about her future husband, (but not so cryptic that the audience wouldn't get the reference.) The Golden Ass is a bawdy comedy, and comedies usually end in reconciliation, if not marriage. 

Normally, this would be cycle of life type stuff, generation out of destruction, a major theme in the later Four Quartets, but not in The Waste Land, in the wake of the deadliest calamity in human history up to that point. This is not merely a comment on the First World War, or even of wars exclusively, but on the history of mankind in general, and the relationship, in many cases, of inhumanity to material gain. Even in the face of, or wake of, destruction, the banker's primary concern is the bottom line. The blitheness of the passage reinforces the concept of casual inhumanity, which may be the greatest horror of all. 

Regarding "Segundus", it means "second" in Latin, thus "John the Second". I'm not sure how to interpret that in context, but there does seem to be some history regarding Latinate English names. This is an area of interest, although I know very little about it. (Offhand, I recall Stoppard's "Septimus Hodge" from the play Arcadia, which is worth seeing/reading, particularly if you are a Strange&Norrell fan.) 

In conclusion: the Crimson Hexagon is the enticing, but impossible goal, that zealots uses as a hollow drive and justification for their destruction. 

In other words, he posits that the Library is literally infinite; that the 25^1312000 individual books repeat over and over. He calls this "elegant," as yet another hope for order in random chaos -- here is suggesting, not only that there are infinite copies of all books, but that the arrangement of those books is preserved. This is an order that cannot be perceived, tested, or comprehended by any mortal, but its (hypothetical) existence is a comfort to the narrator. Another variation arises naturally -- that the Library does extend infinitely, but with different arrangements of the books. Eventually, of course, you would exhaust the possible arrangements of books -- but you could create new configurations of those arrangements, and their location respective to one another. However you look at this, Borges is demonstrating the idea of magnitudes of infinity - e.g. the idea of an infinity of infinities. The Library is metaphorically infinite Part of the point here is that the narrator has no idea what the structure of the universe is. He has no way to discover it. He can guess and conjecture, but is overwhelmed by the ungraspable nature of the Library, and of infinity. The thing is, infinity is not a concept the human mind can grasp easily. In many ways, it is easier for us to understand something finite but whose immensity presses upon us (i.e., a finite Borgesian Library), than the infinity of our own universe (where it is so easy to focus on our own planet, country, home). Understanding true infinity is very difficult; creating an example of true infinity might have resulted in less powerful imagery. But Borges's Library is immense in a way we can grasp intuitively. It gives you a sense of scale -- the difficulty of finding a single comprehensible word in a book generated from random characters; the existence of books that are works of truth and art, as the product of randomly combining characters until one forms. This is not literally infinite, but it feels so near the real thing, as to be metaphorically infinite, to demonstrate the sense of infinity even if it isn't the real thing.
