We can't do this to experienced financial practitioners because they are competitive and highly employable. For your friend - Pay or never step into finance. 

Your experience is not unusual. Many people have had this experience, it's quite common. If you take note at the Kaggle prize winners, they would spend months just on improving error rate by something 2%. The non-winners could spend even more time on no improvement gain. If your existing model is already good, it's not simple to improve it even further. For example, deep learning might not improve the performance much if the data can be linearly separable. You're not alone. 

Sounds like software engineering is not appropriate for you. I suggest you may want to jump into the finance sector. The Wall Street pays lot of money. 

There's nothing to worry here. It might be your friend's only chance to get into the field. You might want to congratulate your friend for the job offer. It's a deal. Your friends buys a job. That's no free lunch, remember your friend has no relevant experience. Your friend is expected to pay to learn. It's just like buying a car, buying a house ... It's a business deal. Nothing suspicious here. Why the bankers receive so much money, and your friends can't (your friend has to pay!)? Want to blame? Blame for the incompetence. Your friend is not good enough, Simple. Read on. 

In general, it's best to clear this up as early as possible. An interview situation in which you are on first-name with the interviewer is probably relaxed enough for you to state your preferred name during the introduction, though I wouldn't correct them if they slip up. (I say "probably" because that depends a bit on how you read the interviewer.) In your case, this is slightly more complicated because all the people you talked to in the interview know you by your first name. How to proceed depends a bit on the circumstances. If you talk to different people, you get a new chance for a first introduction: use it. Otherwise correcting an earlier assumption might be awkward. On the other hand, a friendly explanation ("Actually, I prefer to go by Sara but I was so nervous last time I didn't say anything") might also leave a favourable impression. Again, it depends on your interviewers. Either way, when introducing yourself to the team as a group, it's probably best to mention your full name (first and middle name, because some of them know you by your first name) and stress your preference to be called "Sara". When introduced to people one at a time, you can go directly with "Sara" from the start. If you're introduced by someone else, ask them beforehand to introduce you as "Sara". Later on, a few friendly reminders are probably okay, but if your nickname doesn't stick, it's best to just accept that. 

Your salary is a reflection of how competitive the company thinks your are. It might not have anything to do with your 5-years experience. 

Sorry, working overtime in highly competitive places like Singapore is very common. You are not alone as many Asian cities like Hong Kong, South Korea and Japan are like that. There is nothing suspicious in your question. Working until the next day is not unusual, something that the Europeans here don’t understand. It’s part of the Asian working culture. You are expected to work as long as your body can physical capable of. It will get better once you move into more senior position. Unfortunately, if you don’t obey you are not considered as employable. For your records, my Asian friends would frequently work until 3 or 4 am just before the deadline. Your situation is not as bad as you might think. The Singapore law allows you to say NO. You don’t have to work overtime if you really insist. But ... prepare for pressure, revenge and anger from your team as you're breaking the working culture and trust. It’s bad if you are the only one leaving home early when the whole team stay late. Again, working late is absolutely expected in Asia. Choose: 

A few members of our current worker's council ("Betriebsrat") are leaving the company, so we'll need to find new candidates. I've discussed this topic with some of my colleagues and it seems like nobody really wants to do the part (including myself) but pretty much everyone agrees that someone should. Because of that I'm at least considering the idea of candidating. I know about the short-term benefits of being in the workers' council (increased job protection etc.), but I'm not going to be in this company forever and I'm worried about the long-term consequences. 

Disclaimer: I don't have prosopagnosia myself, but I do have difficulty remembering both names and faces (to a smaller degree). I feel that the best way to deal with this kind of problem is upfront, i.e. the first time you're introduced to a new person. "I have trouble recognizing faces, so please don't take it personally if I don't recognize you the next time we meet. If you want to talk to me, just say hi." Personally, I wouldn't use the more technical term unless someone asks about it. While people might have heard the term "face blindness", hardly anyone will recognize "prosopagnosia". Since you already have been working with your colleagues for a while, you might want to use a casual chatting situation (going to lunch together, hanging out by the coffee machine) to explain your problem. "By the way, I don't know if you noticed, but I'm unable to recognize faces. When I don't greet (any of) you I don't mean to be rude. I simply don't recognize you." Unfortunately, by now you probably have earned a reputation of being rude and standoffish, but if you explain your handicap often enough, chances are people will be understanding. Also, depending on how many people are in your office, you could just say hi (or nod or whatever) to everyone you meet as a friendly non-committal greeting, at least when you first arrive in the morning. After that, I don't think I ever greet my colleagues when I pass them in the corridor. 

The best strategy is to use the money to buy some programming books. Make yourself work 7 days and the boss works 7 days as well. Do it yourself. 

You are really not in business to judge somebody else vacation time. Those UK staffs are entitled to receive their legal benefits. You may also take some sick leaves to compensate yourself for the unfairness. Not feeling happy? You could resign your US position and then move to the UK yourself for better vacation benefits. That will make your new position equal to your former UK based but working in US workmates. 

Your former colleagues owed you nothing, it was your own decision leaving. Why would they try to help you? Who do you think you are? Threatening to remove them from your contacts for not recommending a job that they might not have is selfish and stupid. How well do they really know you? What do they get for helping you? Give a reason why they should help you especially the company had already attempted to convince you for staying. You shouldn't have contacted them in the first place, you should have contacted your former boss or/and hiring manager. Your contact list will be almost empty if everyone in your list must offer you a job. Had you ever offered them anything? You are now external to the company and it's employees. They have no obligation for offering you any employment. It was your fault for moving to a new position. -------- Don't remove them just because you have no response. They were not obligated to write you back. The point of Linkedln is to keep a professional network, and you shouldn't have any personal information that you don't feel sharing just because you don't have response. 

I've never heard of the idea of explicitly answering the "N years of X" question. Usually, that's answered by the CV in which you list your part-time jobs with start and end dates. Finished projects count for a lot! Bonus points if you can link to the websites and/or present testimonials by happy customers. It's not clear how much of your experience consists of private projects, but absolutely list them too. However, if nothing was published or hosted on github etc. that might not count for much. I usually summarize my projects in a single bullet point. Use the cover letter to expound the skills you earned during the projects, both when it comes to coding and soft skills. 

10 years is much too large a gap to leave unexplained, especially if it's a recent gap. I agree with Christopher that your would-be employer is likely to assume the worst. Also, you held the job for 10 years, and you'd lose out on all the experience gained during that time. I would list the job and any relevant skills, but don't include the reason for leaving in the resume at all, for any job listed. However, be prepared for the inevitable question in the interview. When that happens, don't lie! (That could be grounds for dismissal even if they only find out about it after you're already hired.) Without knowing the specifics for your firing, you can probably present the information in a way that doesn't entirely damn you: For example, if you were ultimately fired because of a mistake you made, own up to it (but maybe play it down a little) and explain why it won't happen again. 

The most common strategy for career switching is to go back to university, gain a degree say in finance, and then start fresh as a graduate programmer. Full-time master degrees should take you just about a year to complete. 

There's not much you can do. If you aren't allowed to internal transfer, then you don't have the power to do it. You could try to talk to the higher level, but that still wouldn't work if your manager refuses. Check if you have redundancy package (large companies in many countries need to do that). If you don't, I'd look for a new job if I were you. 

Unfortunately this is common in finance startups. I know it well because I was in finance. The finance startups can do that because: 

When I interview candidates, I always ask for Github projects. Why? That's because I'd have better insight of what the candidate can do without asking them for a stressful stupid coding test. If your job requires bash script, that doesn't mean you must have an open source project for bash. You just need to build a portfolio of open-source projects you have done. Build something you love, do it good. Try to start a community for your project. 

It's absolutely OK to ask this question, same as asking whether it's a technical interview or you're talking to HR. I don't think anyone will hold it against you. I've always asked something along the lines of, "Could you tell me who I will be talking to?" which kills two birds with one stone as not only tells you how many people will take part in the interview but also gives you information about your interview partners (i.e. their position in the company). 

"Experience with the agile methodology" sounds like something that would be listed among the skills the employer considers "nice to have". But even if it's listed among the "required" skills, if it's the only missing skill, you should apply anyway. The agile workflow is not that difficult and if you're not the one who has to organize it (don't apply for the position of Scrum Coach, for example), it should be easy to pick up. Depending on how strictly you followed the Waterfall model before, it might take some getting used to that development requirements are not set in stone before you start working. That doesn't mean there's no planning at all, but that the initial roadmap is comparatively rough ("we need feature A, feature B and feature C, and each will take roughly 3 months to implement"). A more detailed planning takes place when the time of implementation approaches, and the feature is then "broken down" into smaller portions that can be easily estimated and completed in a much shorter time frame. That means that you'll usually spend several iterations working on the same feature, but again, each iteration is only planned in (even finer) detail shortly before you'll start working on it. The idea behind this is to avoid wasting time planning something that might end up on the cutting table when requirements change in response to already delivered features. That said, as others said, not having experience with the agile methodology does mean that you don't know whether the agile workflow even suits your style of working. Whether that's a problem is up to the employer to decide. And it certainly can't hurt to read up on the theory and the pros and cons of the methodology. 

You might feel uncomfortable for the discussion but that is really none of your business. The point of the employment for you is to make money and contribute the society. As long as the business is solid and profitable, there is nothing you should do. 

From the company perspective, you have nothing exciting to offer thus your salary should be lower than a new potential intelligent junior developer. You shouldn't be sad but take it as an opportunity. Now, you know there is someone in your team understand software development better than you. You can learn from the new developer and absorb the new skills into your your works. 

Please ask yourself and your senior data scientists if the target performance is reasonable or not. For example, it's not reasonable to expect a 100% accuracy for the simple MINST data set. Assume the target performance is reasonable and your boss wants that to happen. Generally, you have the following options: 

I don't see anything wrong. That's not your coworker's properties, everything belongs to the company. You're free to do whatever you want and exploit the company's assets to your advantage. Yes, don't need to ask, just do it. The management will be appreciated. You're not being rude, you're just doing your job.
