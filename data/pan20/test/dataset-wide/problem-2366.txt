Assuming you ear is in good condition as you hear well in night. Since you are sensitive at night, and not at day, when things are quiet, is that you are more composed or focused with you attention at the ear to hearing than in day time. During the perhaps with other activities you are also distracted hence attention is not fulling on the sounds you hear. 

Te,vijja Sutta Mahāsupina Jātaka does mention the Buddha interpreting 16 dreams King Pasenadi Kosala. But with regarding dreams, there might be no accurate way to interpret them, by anyone other than the Buddha. Dreams are not meditative states. In meditation you should be focusing on a particular object or having awareness. In both cases it is unlikely you might have a dream unless you dose off. 

Maybe you are swallowing air. This could be the case. Or generally you have become sensitive to your digesting process which you didn't notice before. Heavy meals can do this perhaps. Try lighter meals. Sometimes based on olf Karma practitioners get certain recurring issues for a period. See if this is the case after a few months. If you have a teacher discuss this with him / her. If not perhaps you can try visiting one or andd organised course where you have a chance to discuss these issues with a teacher.

How is the mind matter process described and explained according to the Buddhist teachings? How does it related to Cognitive Psychology? How is the next moment created from the current? What is the mechanism behind it? How does this process sustain its self? What are the variation with regard to this if any? 

You are wasting your time and others time. Talk that is productive towards betterment of oneself, which lacks proper reasoning (mud slinging), if you are monk not connected with the goal, the pratice, the Dhamma or Vinaya. 

What every order both develop Jhana is important to strengthening of wisdom and ultimately both should be developed. So when practising meditation, it is not the best to take the stance that you aim to develop exclusively on or the other, though different techniques maybe conducive for one or the other, but at time when you reap better results in areas which were not intended this also should be accepted. (Having concentration can lead to wisdom and wisdom lead to concentration through the practice is geared to the other.) If you have concentration wisdom is easy but you need some active effort (through not very much) to develop it though. 

There are 2 main bodily functions. The breath and the heartbeat. In calming the bodily fabrications it is not just calming the breath until it stops. When the breath stops then you have to look at any movement on the body. Generally it will be the heartbeat. This will also eventually slowdown and stop. This is the point where you have calmed down all bodily fabrications. (In context of Anapana you have completed the 1st 4 stages.) 

There are multiple Maras in Buddhism. One of them is a Deva. Other others being death, conditioned existence, and unskillful emotions. 

The demarcation of Sankara is Nirvana which is not conditioned. Everything else is: beings, world, external, objects, etc. which is conditioned. 

This appears in the Najīratisutta ( Najīrati - What does not decay / what does not age; version in Sinhala and English). From what I have heard and learned in this context what is referenced as Nama is reputation and not the mind. E.g. the some historic people are long gone but they are still remembered for what they were. 

There is both a physical and non physical part. Science cannot proble not non physical aspects hence. So any scientific proof and disproof is not considering all the facts. 

A plant also lives but is not a being as it does not meet the above. It does not have a mind (henceforth Citta and Cetasika doe not arise) or consciousness, not subjected DO or 4NT. Plants also need nutrients but not the 4 nutrients which sustain a being. A being is born another being in one of the 31 planes of existence or becomes extinguished if you attain Nibbana. An animate being cannot become an inanimate object like a stone. Perhaps a way to access if a something is alive is through birth, aging and death along with the above factors. Something that is born ages and dies. Plants also does the same so they are alive but not beings. 

Another way these symptoms can have arisen is higher insights: The Progress of Insight - Awareness of Fearfulness to Knowledge of Re-observation Also some mild forms of restlessness can be due to low level defilements and excessive thinking and pondering about the Dhamma which is mentioned in (Yuga,naddha) Paṭipadā Sutta. 

The most detail version of Dependent Origination (DO) contains 24 points and extremely complicated like a web, which is called Conditional Relations or Patthana. The 12 link version is a simplification. Also there other simplified versions of which can can read more in Dependent Arising by Piya Tan. If you take DO the most important part is as this is the place you can break the cycle. If you look at Nutriment (ahara) this teachers this subset. If you look Suttas like Pahāna Sutta which essentially teachers a more simplified version of this: or more inline with how it i presented: . Also note when it says craving this includes aversion as aversion is a craving to part with. Based on the audience and their inclination to understand, the Buddha is presenting accordingly. 

All Theravada Buddhists abstain from Alcohol. This is well explained in "THE FIVE PRECEPTS" which is a very good read on the 5 precepts. 

Dhātu Vibhaṅga Sutta So when you get a sense imput be equanimous towards these sensation without it leading to craving, aversion and ignorance. 

Modern Understating There are infinite number of Buddhas in the past (though only few are recorded), and they preached the same Dhamma. With respect to Science this is always in constant evolution in terms of the understanding and body of knowledge. Though Science generally may not refute Buddhism drawing parallels may not be useful. Understanding the 4 Elements Understanding of the 4 elements should be at the experiential level or at the level that is felt. Conceptual understanding falls into the sphere of Perception, through this is also essential, but as stepping stone to the next item which is putting into practice with a view to experience it for one self. 

Process of insight up roots Loba, Dosa, Moha 1st and hence as you practice you are left with more Aloba, Adosa, Amoha and Ahetuka states of mind. In addition 5 hindrances also fall away of which ill will is diminishments cases more competition. When liberated you are left Ahetuka but still evil roots are no more hence relatively compassionate with someone who has ill will and the evil roots. 

If you consolidate the instructions from the Tripitaka and other sources what would be the variations and additions to the instructions given in the Maha Satipatthana Sutta? 

The interaction of these perceptions are causing grief and pain. You cannot just get rid of perception at will. The process to get rid of the perception thus riding your self of the pain is Vipassana Meditation. 

Though is modern times this might seem controversial Bahu Dhātuka Sutta mentions certain things a woman cannot achieve: 

Udumbarika Sihanada Sutta According to the above statement you do not have to change any of your practices and faiths. In addition to whatever practices you are doing now practice: 

Material pleasures are based on sensations. Ultimate spiritual pleasures of Nirvana independent of sensation. Regarding material pleasure, or pleasure of a householder, there are 6 types which is elaborated in Sal,āyatana Vibhanga Sutta. At an intermediate state or spirituality (still working towards Nirvana) there are 6 kinds of pleasures associated with renunciation which is elaborated in Sal,āyatana Vibhanga Sutta. In simple terms the difference is the householder pleasure is through acquiring and getting pleasant experiences while spiritual pleases is thought renunciation and understanding / wisdom / seeing things as they are. Since the ultimate spiritual pressure does not end or pass away and independent of any external factor or cause it is far superior than any pleasure based on sensations which are temporary and not in one's control and cause by or dependent on any other factors and causes. The intermediate pleasures or pleasures of renunciation, are still based on understanding and wisdom, hence they are also superior. 

No. If someone is trying to kill you for not converting though death is inevitable there is no self hate. 

Also be warned that only a few a successful in developing supernormal powers and this can become a hindrance, hence you are better of working towards liberation. 

The key ingredient in mindfulness is what ever you sense you should not react with craving and clinging noting the sensation is impermanent. To make your body sensitive You should make your body sensitive since all mind matter creates sensations and any changes in the aggregates is sensed through the sensation it creates. So in doing any of the 4 foundation of mindfulness sensation play a key role. Scan your body from part to part systematically without missing any part until you feel some sensation in the part you examine. Start with small areas and linger on the part during the start but keep increasing the pace you move and the size of the area seeing if you are fully sensitive to any sensation in the whole area when doing so, i.e., when you sense something in the whole area move on to another area systemically - the time to sense any sensation will become shorter and shorter until it becomes instant and through out the body. Calm the fabrications You have to calm all fabrication before realising the final goal. Passive You keep looking at sensation the fabrications will disappear. First the gross sensations and then pleasant sensation leaving you with neutral sensations. After some practice, mere looking at any fabrication it disappears. Active Calm the breath by looking at the process its speed and length, make the efforts to anchor the mind, if there are body sensations look at it until it disappears (it happens in a short duration) until you have pleasant or neutral sensations Overcoming some of the hindrances As I see it, there seams to be some hindrances to your daily practice. They might be the following: Agitation If your mind seams very active and restless then more from part to part fast scanning large areas but progressively staying longer and making the area a bit smaller. Note the speed and length or breathing also. Mental Lethargy Increase space of scanning to arouse energy. This is also a mental fabrication do generally you should do this in a medium pace (not too long or too short in any part). Do some intentional breathing increasing the length and speed marginally. 

Mental Fabrications is associated with sensations, hence will not stop until sensations stop. There are ways to stop thoughts is to develop Nirodha Samapatti or realise Nirvana by other means. When you have Nirvana as object only will your thinking stop. Verbal fabrication which is Thinking and Pondering will stop in the second Jhana. When breathing stops your bodily fabrications have stopped. But when thoughts arise new fabrications arise which might have bodily impact hence breathing start again. The there is a gap or breathing stops you have to contemplate the sensations you experience in the upper lip or even the whole body. See: LECTURE FOUR: MASTERING THE VEDANA by ANAPANASATI - MINDFULNESS WITH BREATHING Unveiling the Secrets of Life: a Manual for Serious Beginners. When the breath is there look at the flow and touch of the breath. When it is not the sensations on the last point the breath touched. (2nd Tetrads) Do not get alarmed if your breath stops for a long duration but this should not be forced.
