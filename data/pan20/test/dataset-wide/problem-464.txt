I recently bought a Scott CR1 SL 2012 frame to replace a crash damaged frame on my 2009 Boardman Team Carbon road bike. The intention being to move as much as possible across from the old bike on to the new bike. Mostly all went well, I even managed to cut the fork and install the headset. I didn't have any specific tools and the press-fit went in by firm hand pressure. Anyway, on to the BB and crank. The old bike was running SRAM Rival and SRAM GXP cranks. New frame came with Shimano press-fit BB already fitted (I believe to be Shimano SM-BB91-41B). From a lot of internet searching it was still unclear whether the BB is compatible with GPX crank so I gave it a go to see. Once fitted it actually seemed fine but after a short test ride there was a bit of play that no tightening could get rid of. I left it for a week then went back to it to remove when I had a spare 5 minutes...... Oh dear, in my rush I forgot that to remove I need to leave the outer 'screw' in and loosen the inner one to push the crank arm off. Instead I screwed a crankpuller in to the crankarm and kept tigntening and managed to strip it. So now left with a stuck crank arm. So first things - need to remove the crankarm, I have tried hammering it outwards and it seems to have budged a bit but now none further. Going to try a gentle ride soon to see if that helps. The arm is knackered so also could cut it off but how easy is that? Any other suggestions. I'm not sure riding it is going to work but it may..... Once it is off what to do next? I think options are: 1) Swap BB to Sram BB86 GXP and stick with my crankset after buying a new crankarm. Problem here is removing and fitting the BBs, new tools etc 2) Go Shimano crankset, the 'off the shelf' bike uses Dura Ace but could use a lower range crankset that would fit the BB I suppose. I'm leaning towards (2) as it involves less fitment work on my part although will cost a bit more but at the same time I don't mind upgrading anyway..... Any thoughts on first of all removing the old arm? Then what would you do given my options? Thanks 

You can completely change the front setup (shifter, cables, crankset and/or derailleur) completely independently of the cassette and rear derailleur/shifter with no problem. If it's a used bike it may be worth checking the chain/cassette are not worn in case the do need to be changed (but would be unrelated to the fact that the front setup was changed) Update - As per comment from @batman, if the size of the crankset has changed the length of the chain may need to be updated also 

I replaced my brake pads about a week ago and today I noticed that, when turning (or generally under lateral force), the rim touches one of the brake pads (depending on which way I'm turning. I hadn't noticed it before but today was the first wet day so maybe the sound was louder because of this. I don't notice myself slowing down at all, but don't really want to be unnecessarily wearing down my brakes. The brakes aren't super close when released, maybe 2-3mm on each side. I would expect a certain amount of flex in the wheel, but as I built the wheel myself I just wanted to check that this wasn't a problem with my build (though its already done 1000 miles probably so it cant be too bad!) There would be room to widen the brakes slightly if this is all that might be required. When stationary and holding the wheel and applying lateral force manually I can make the rim touch either brake pad without a great deal of effort. Any input appreciated Thanks! 

(update) You can checkout some design under wikipedia bicycle parking rack page. the easiest way is google "buy bicycle parking rack". Depends on region, there may not be "ready made" for mass bicycle parking near your local bicycle shop. You need to find workshop that fabricate those rack/stand/pole/etc. 

About the "metal deteriorate issues" - A proper maintain steel frame will not rust. Lube and oil them, you will never see the oxidisation - Alluminium "rust" will stop when oxidation form on the outer layer. In addition, steel frame WILL NOT rust, if you maintain it properly. 

In fact, using a cloth to wipe clean the bike dirt are quite eco-friendly. You might use less water if doing it properly. It also reduce the risk of splashing water into bearing,etc. For heavy dirt like mud, first use gardening spray lightly spray to wet up dirt in order to remove them. Just be careful when dumping the waste water, toilet bowl is a good idea compare to bathtub drain. For greasy part, spray grease removal/solvent and use paper towel instead of cloth. Don't feel bad about "saving the tree" on the paper towel. Though cloth are "reusable" ,you will waste water and pouring those greasy dirt into your drainage, which is more harmful to the environment. 

Grease itself does has various characteristic depends on application. Unless you are going to submerge your bicycle and keep cycling, otherwise general purpose grease will do the job. Just a plain copy and paste : 

Stationary stand on the pedal to lighten a bump is a different story. While standing to pedal yourself up to the hill is a bad idea. Sheldon brown has write something about Standing while Cycling and how to fix it or avoid it. Putting too much pressure on the knee is how people getting sport injuries from bicycling. I just want to add one more point : knee injuries are difficult to heal. The knee Meniscus are not renewable. You need to checkout explicit instruction to train to use the muscle and tendon around the knee. 

The cable could have broken, leaving the derailleur sitting on the smallest cog on the upper limit. I had this a few weeks ago, the cable had broken within the shifter so was not immediately visible. If when shifting you feel little or no resistance when trying to change to a lower gear this will be a good indicator that this is the problem. 

This is very doable! I'm midway though building my fourth and fifth wheels for my own bikes from scratch with no more than an upside down bike, the internet and a spoke key (or screwdriver to begin with). There are a number of different lacing patterns to choose from depending on your own preference and possibly the length of spoke available to you. There are also a number of websites which will tell you what length the spokes will need to be, though in this case you can just measure the existing ones. Definitely don't by cheap spokes (unless they are good quality spokes for a great price). My third wheel lasted less than one day because two spokes snapped within 20 miles. It could be that this was down to a poor build but my first two wheels are still good after 500 miles with no adjustment required (using ACI plain guage spokes). Once you start getting towards tension (you can pretty much feel how tight they should be from a built wheel) focus primarily on any vertical movement before lateral as this is much more difficult to correct when at full tension. Put the wheel under tension before assuming its completed. When I think I'm true I squeeze the spokes together with my hands, and check true again. Then I attach the wheel to a bike and walk it around whilst applying some pressure to either the seat or handlebars depending on the wheel and check true again. THEN I go for a ride around a car park and, you guessed it! Check true again! Its not a hugely difficult task to complete, but a very difficult one to perfect.
