Obviously copyright infringement, under every main stream school of thought is wrong. You put work into creating something, such as a video file that is a movie that you spent millions of dollars to produce, and you therefore have, according to every main stream school of thought, the right to sell that video file for a profit. I'm clarifying that I understand this, and that I realize it's common sense, but I have the sneaking suspicion that if I were to question one of the leading proponents of copyright infringement, for example an operator of The Piriate Bay, and member/founder of a pro-copyright-infringement religion, Kopimism, I would receive some form of very thoroughly thought out philosophical reasoning for supporting copyright infringement. Unfortunately, I dont have the privilege of being able to have a discussion with such a person, in order to poke and prod for logical, fundamental reasoning for such support. I'm very curious though, to discover and dissect the arguments behind this school of thought, so I ask: Does anyone know what philosophical arguments / logic copyright infringement supporters, use to defend and promote their position? 

– roughly one quarter are wins and it seems intuitively the ratio would converge to 0.25. So obviously, just any and all infinite sequences, which converge “correctly” (like the first very regular one), will not do. They may in some sense not be “random” and so not admissible. But if we want to base our concept of probability on infinite sequences, we would at least need an exact grasp what infinite sequences are random and therefore admissible. Mises failed to give such a criterion. And so his analogy with the concept of velocity in physics breaks down, similar problems don't occur in the calculus machinery used there. It's still, by itself, a non-argument to just say that infinite sequences do not exist in observable reality. 

The Chinese room argument is very fascinating, but it is not remotely decisive, because as close as we get to what's going on in the Chinese room “AI”, something may escape the in(tro)spection of the human interpreter of the “Chinese question answering” program – and exactly what we miss may be the elusive “mental content” (intentionality). Later, when Searle had thought about the issue more deeply, he came up with far stronger, indeed devastating, – though more “boring” – arguments which can be found in his paper “Is the Brain a Digital Computer?”, mainly section IV. Now why does Searle think that consciousness is “obviously” physical? He never gave us a satisfying answer to this question! Searle is, for all the evidence we have, a great influential and original1 philosopher, but still a confused one. He is able to make interesting and extremely strong arguments, but sometimes his views just lack justification and he doesn't really care! He may even admit the flaws in his argumentation, like that the analogy between solidity and consciousness as physical macro-properties is very questionable (because solidity is, contrary to consciousness, readily 3rd person-observable, exactly like the micro-structure of the body – so no solution to the p-zombie argument or the hard problem of consciousness is in sight here), but for whatever reason still sticks to it. Searle is a philosopher who readily grants that “[t]he property dualist and I are in agreement that consciousness is ontologically irreducible”, but still doesn't bother to give a good reason – it's probably obvious that his arguments (for example in his essay “Why I Am Not a Property Dualist”) are unpersuasive for anyone with some philosophical maturity (see here) – why the obvious conclusion that some form of dualism is unavoidable, does not follow. Why Searle sometimes works so sloppily is unanswerable, of course. But he does. 

I'm not enough of a philosopher to properly analyze this particular argument, but I'm curious about it and I'd like to see it dissected and explained. 

When you're raised from childhood to believe in faith, its unlikely that you will grow to think outside of that faith, especially if your religion implements a system of repetition where you verbally confirm that faith daily and weekly. You constantly repeat it, everyone around you confirms it, it makes you feel at peace, makes you feel safe, why would you want to think in any other way? My thought about this is that there's a fundamental problem with this way of thinking. Because it seems as a society, by condoning this kind of thinking, we make our population as a whole highly susceptible to extremist and non-tolerant ideas derived from religion. An example: Islamist Extremism, where women and homosexuals can be put to death for pursuing their personal freedoms, and people believe certain cultures should be attacked, that certain people should be killed. If people were not raised with a religious background, I don't see this issue as being possible. It seems to me that this is proof that religion or "believing without proof or logical reasoning" is problematic, that it damages logical decision making in society. Is this an accurate and logical assessment, or am I looking at this information the wrong way? 

What it says, in my perspective is, is analogous to the following: You don't specifically need software application A to show the logical behavior of transistors inside a CPU. You could also do that with software application B. So here software application A and B are the subject matter, or the content terms. Where as the behavior of the CPU is the abstract level you are proving the logical behavior of. Here is another example. The concept of addition. Here I proof the logical validity of addition: "When I take 3 apples, and I take 2 apples more, and put these inside a bag, I have 5 apples in my bag." The logical concept proven here doesn't require an example with apples. It could have been any example to explain the concept op addition. So the subject matter of apples inside a bag is not important to proof the logical form of addition. If apples would be required, its not an abstract logical concept. As logic doesn't apply to specific matter. Math for example doesn't only apply to the stock market, but applies on the whole universe. 

Is mereological nihilism, the metaphysical doctrine that objects with proper parts do not exist, the same as atomism? If not, what are the differences? How can mereological nihilism work without assuming that there are at some point only objects which do not contain parts, i.e. philosophical atoms (things that are not composed, which means undividable)? If philosophical atoms do not exist, it would follow from mereological nihilism that nothing does exist, because everything has proper parts. 

A reductio ad absurdum is a correct way to argue. An argument by lack of imagination is an informal fallacy. But if a reductio ad absurdum is applied outside of a highly formalized setting like mathematics, how do we distinguish it from an argument by lack of imagination? Isn't stating that something is absurd the same as stating that you can't imagine it to be true? 

But clearly: “proof, that X does not exist” ≫ “presenting evidence against X” That is, a proof is a strong conclusive result, the bar for it is much higher than for just presenting some evidence. So in his fairy-analogy he subtly changed the subject. Therefore Dawkins engages in straw-manning. But this doesn't have anything to do with the fairies. What if Dawkins had said the following: (?) 

I've been thinking about government assistance, and on one hand, I dont want to let people die, but on the other hand, I dont want to let them live by taking advantage of my generosity. For example, if a capable person refuses to work, what would logic in favor of humanitarianism suggest that we do? Let them starve? Feed them anyway? Both choices seem to lead to frowned upon results. If too many people take advantage of a system in which all people will be fed regardless, it seems that the society may weaken or collapse. And then there's a matter of fairness, in regards to the people who work, and have their earnings taxed to feed those who wont work. Is there any philosophy which addresses this problem? I'm looking for a citation of any philosophy on the subject which wouldn't be considered "highly" controversial. I'd narrow my question to a single philosophy, but I haven't heard of one which covers this problem. 

Maybe this can't and shouldn't be altogether answered in a "yes or no" format without pulling from subjective opinion, but perhaps there is or is not invalid logic or circular reasoning or perhaps it's a perfectly acceptable logical argument, so far as structure is concerned. 

But chewing gum looks strikingly parallel to masturbation. It even decreases appetite, like masturbation temporarily reduces sexual tension. The digestive system prepares for food, but no food is taken. The reproductive system of a solitary masturbating woman prepares for heterosexual intercourse (or so claims Feser), but in the end, no man has sex with her. So to finally get to the question: In the article, is the differentiation between “contrary to” and “other than” really meaningful? If yes, then how exactly should we understand it? If not, can you go into more details how and why the reasoning here became fallacious? PS: I'm genuinely just trying to understand how people manage to reach such strange conclusions – no intentions to make this an “am I right?” post. 

The example you give comes from political philosophy. But who can deny that political philosophy is relevant? Who can claim that Locke or Marx were not enormously influential? And they are surely examples of careful reasoning. Historically, political philosophy mainly worked through convincing the elites, which in turn influenced the masses. Change coming from the masses itself rarely had something to do with political philosophy, it was caused by empirical data which had discredited the elites. Now, if users on this site boringly demolish a mind-blowingly stupid slogan, I think that this is relevant to real life, because it is some tiny, tiny step to get get away from this disdainful view about the masses. It hopefully inoculated those 32K viewers against one of the most extreme examples of stupid thinking in the public discourse and in turn may raise the level of debate. 

From my interpretation, religion is a school of thought that encourages or rather demands that we believe in something on faith. Faith is to believe in something because we have been told that it is true and we must believe it without any proof of its existence or proof that it's the right way to think. Our parents teach us this, our society confirms that we must follow this teaching. I think that's all common knowledge, nothing to argue about there, but this next thought is an idea that I'd like to question. I'd like to know if my following idea makes sense logically or not, and why: 

The simple, fundamental answer: "Logic" is fundamentally just mathematics. A + B = C. But our ideas as humans are so complex and so subjective, they don't fit into any math equation. Our brain has developed in such a way that can calculate the logic of these ideas, but it's not by any means a truly logical calculation, but more of a rough estimate. Engineers working to develop Artificial Intelligence, I'm told, are having a big problem figuring out how to get their algorithms to work because they can't figure out how to teach a computer to make the "correct decision". They're trying to calculate "right and wrong" in binary and it wont work. To solution will be to stop trying to calculate "right and wrong" because it doesnt exist. Only our personal emotional interpretations exist. As a society, and as cultures, we have had to unify our "personal interpretations" of right and wrong in order to live in harmony, but logical decision making will always be just a rough estimate, a very imperfect calculation because logical thinking is purely relative. 

This is something you can teach yourself, just like playing the piano. The point of this is that you self-reflect that you are not doing anymore what you want to do and get back at it. Google on "lucid dreaming and fMRI" and you will have biological evidence that areas in the brain of self reflection are more active during lucid(conscious/awake) dreaming, than non lucid dreaming. That your mind is wondering of is because the angst/anxiety is controlling you (or you let it control you). First you will experience those fears that are just beneath the conscious surface. The more you practice the exercise above, the more angst you will discover that lies deep down inside you. When you know/experience they are there, you can do something about it, recude them, and take control. Can you imagine, that those fears that live deep down inside you, that almost never get to the surface, influence very much of your daily life experience? As long as there are others things controlling you (or you are letting them control you) you have less control than you could possible have: you are dreaming. This has thought me that I am dreaming often throughout the day, while almost anybody would say they are perfectly awake and not dreaming at all. That is because I am not skilled enough yet to constantly think about what I want and act upon that. The exercise above gives me more control of experience life because I can put more into it of how I want it to be, because of reducing the fears. I even start living at night: consciously experiencing the dream reality. Its starts with playing around (like children learn their environment) but it becomes more than that. You can really practice overcoming fears and use strong willpower (intention) to create what you want and see the effects immediately. So the give one concrete answer to your question: You know you aren't dreaming in some aspect when you have consciously created what you wanted in that aspect that has created synergy (more than there was). I use aspect because again, this isn't a binary state. It is not that you create all that you(with good intention) desire, or you create nothing at all. That would also imply there is an ending state. But combining stuff to create synergy is endless. It is fact you can create partially, step by step, what you desire: the house, spouse, children, work, quality time you desire, as long as it creates synergy. That is how your consciousness grows. Look up things like: 

One definition of “essentialism” would be that it is a kind of realism of universals with the additional claim that every particular p instantiates a certain universal E which determines its existence. That is: “p exists” can only be true as long as p exemplifies E. But then someone like EJ Lowe claims: 

If we interpret “if A then B” as “it can never be the case that A is true and B is false” and reasonable infer from the definition of “triangle” that a triangle being two-sided can never happen, then your sentence is true. Because if A is always wrong, this alone makes “if A then B” true. Curiously, with this interpretation, also the following sentence: 

But if everything is metaphysically contingent, why should we think that “anything can happen”? Between 

Assumption as in blind faith? No. But “assumption” that we need rational insight beyond formal proofs, yes. The “assumption” that the axiom systems lack internal contradiction (= one is able to derive both a theorem and its negation from the axioms) is usually necessary for mathematics. That would be the easy answer. More difficult is the question of applied mathematics, because mathematics is obviously applied directly in many cases, not just as a tool of a clearly empirical science like physics. If we put together 1 l of a blue chemical and 1 l of a red chemical and create a purple mixture, mathematics can't tell us, of course, that we will get 2 l of purple mixture. But the curious thing is that if we do get, say, 1.8 l of purple mixture, we don't shrug it off like “Well, mathematics doesn't have anything to do with reality anyway!”, no, we look for an explanation, like a chemical reaction or physical causes, for this “abnormal behavior”. The usual mathematical operations, from +, -, /, * to differentiation & integration, seem to mirror an abstract “ideal behavior” of the real world, and that's something that can't be justified empirically. But for somebody to call this blind faith he must have developed a strong allergy to anything that looks a bit like rationalism. 

No, it wouldn't, it would be better. If all beings were to act good, synergy will be formed, hence everybody would live a happier live. "Would it be better if everyone was good?" Yes. 

You might be very interested in reading this book: $URL$ I read it 5/6 so far, its really life perspective changing and very positive and constructive. Its the best book I read about truth and consciousness so far, and I read quiet a few. With its logical assessments and derivations, it truly is a Big Theory of Everything. 

Don't anthropomorphize God. It doesn't have to necessarily be a being with feelings. It might just be a system that hosts beings to evolve, that have feelings. Flooding the earth in SimCity isn't horrible at all to the computer that causes the event. 

This answer is based on the following assumption: It is better to have experience accompanied by knowledge, than just knowledge. So lets try the following to (hopefully) gain experience. See it as me proving to you that you can discern between states of dreaming and states of wakefulness, I can't just do that with solely you reading text I typed, you have to do something. This is based on the assumption that reality is more than just intellect. The other (right) half of your brain is also involved in processing your reality, and that is the emotional/experimental aspect. So do the exercise below, please:
