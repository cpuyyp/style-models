No it is not ! Let $f:\mathbb{A}^1\to\mathbb{A}^1$ be defined by $f(x)=x^2$. It is not surjective at the level of $k$-points, because there are elements of $k$ that are not squares. 

The new edition of SGA3 by Philippe Gille et Patrick Polo provides a connected example due to Raynaud. It is in SGA3 Exposé VIA Exemples 1.3.2 (2) and you may find it at $URL$ This example is $2$-dimensional, but it is easy to modify it to get a $1$-dimensional example if the characteristic of the base field is at least $3$. More precisely, let $G$ be defined by the equations $X^p-tY^p=Y^p-tZ^p=0$ in the additive group $\mathbb{G}_a^3$ over the field $\mathbb{F}_p(t)$, $p\neq 2$. Then $G$ is a connected group scheme of dimension $1$ whose reduction is not a subgroup scheme, as may be seen by following step by step the arguments of loc. cit. 

It is a theorem of Sumihiro (Equivariant completion, Corollary 2) that a normal variety over an algebraically closed field with an action of a torus is covered by invariant affine open subsets. Here, the normality hypothesis is necessary : the conclusion does not hold for the action of $\mathbb{G}_m$ on $\mathbb{P}^1$ with $0$ and $\infty$ glued together transversally. The hypothesis that the group is a torus is also necessary. Indeed, the statement already fails for SL(2), even for a proper action. There is an example in Białynicki-Birula and Święcicka's paper "On complete orbit spaces of SL(2) actions II". 

Motivation: Erdos-Renyi random graphs $G(n,p)$ must have average vertex degree greater than, before they become connected and have nice expansion properties, etc. But this is because they still have isolated vertices. Here we don't have the problem of isolated vertices. (I think I can show that these graphs are a.a.s. connected.) I am aware of the large literature on random $d$-regular graphs, but I thought this might be an alternative model if one does not care about regularity. I am especially wondering about spectral properties of these graphs. 

Torquato and Stillinger have a recent survey article that discusses some questions like this: Jammed hard-particle packings: From Kepler to Bernal and beyond They are particularly interested in random packings. A short answer to your question is that for hard spheres, it is generally believed that random jammed packings are close to "isostatic," meaning the average contact number is $2d$, where $d$ is the dimension. 

There have been several recent advances on packing regular tetrahedra in $\mathbb{R}^3$. All the results I've seen have been lower bounds -- first John Conway and Sal Torquato showed that there exists an arrangement of tetraheda filling about 72% of space. This has been improved in a series of papers, and the latest result of which I am aware is Elizabeth Chen's record of 85.63%. (A NYTimes article summarizing the history of the problem can be found here.) My question is does anyone know of any upper bounds, either published or unpublished? I saw a colloquium by Jeff Lagarias, and he said someone was claiming that they had proved something like $1 - 10^{-26}$, but that it was still unpublished. (A compactness argument gives that since regular tetrahedra don't tile space the maximum volume is strictly less than one, but this argument does not give a quantitative bound.) 

There are such examples over some fields with trivial Brauer group, but not over finite fields. Let me explain why. Over a finite field $k$, any geometrically integral variety $X$ has a zero-cycle of degree $1$. Indeed, by the Lang-Weil estimates, it has a rational point over the field extensions of $k$ of degrees $2^n$ and $3^n$ for $n\gg 0$, and these degrees are prime to each other. If $X$ is moreover proper, it follows that the Picard functor $T\mapsto \text{Pic}(X_T)/\text{Pic}(T)$ is already a fppf sheaf (and is moreover representable). When $X$ has a rational point, the argument given in [Néron models, 8.1, p. 203] uses the fact that the rational point induces a retraction of the natural pull-back map $\text{Br}(T)\to \text{Br}(X_T)$. But if there is only a zero-cycle of degree 1, it is still possible to construct such a retraction using restriction and corestriction maps for the Brauer groups, so that the argument still works. On the other hand, suppose that $k=\mathbb{C}((t))$: this field has trivial Brauer group because it is $C_1$ by Lang's theorem. Let $C/k$ be a smooth geometrically connected genus $1$ curve whose minimal regular model over $\mathbb{C}[[t]]$ has a multiple special fiber, so that $C$ has no rational point. Then I claim that the functor $T\mapsto \text{Pic}(X_T)/\text{Pic}(T)$ is not a fppf sheaf. Indeed, if it were, it would be representable by the Picard scheme of $C$. In particular, there would be a Poincaré line bundle $\mathcal{L}$ on $C\times E$, where $E$ is the jacobian of $C$. Let $\bar{k}/k$ be an algebraic closure. Then $\mathcal{L}_{\bar{k}}$ is also a Poincaré line bundle realizing $C_{\bar{k}}$ as the jacobian of $E_{\bar{k}}$: in particular, there exists a unique $x\in C(\bar{k})$ such that $\mathcal{L}|_{E_x}$ is trivial. But if $y\in C(\bar{k})$ is in the Galois-orbit of $x$, $\mathcal{L}|_{E_y}$ also has a nowhere vanishing section, hence is also trivial, proving that $y=x$. This shows that $x$ induces a rational point on $C$, a contradiction. As a last comment, if $k=\mathbb{C}((t))$, and $C/k$ is a smooth geometrically connected genus 2 curve, then $C$ necessarily has a degree $1$ zero-cycle, so that the Picard functor $T\mapsto \text{Pic}(X_T)/\text{Pic}(T)$ is already a fppf sheaf (and is moreover representable). For this and related results, see [Esnault, Levine, Wittenberg, Index of varieties over Henselian fields and Euler characteristic of coherent sheaves, Example 2.6]. 

It is easier to just look at one row. Let $c$ be the number of chosen cells to be fixed as $1$, then its distribution is $\frac{{\left( {\begin{array}{*{20}{c}} {n - 1} \\ c \end{array}} \right)\left( {\begin{array}{*{20}{c}} {\frac{{{n^2} - n}}{2} - (n - 1)} \\ {k - c} \end{array}} \right)}}{{\left( {\begin{array}{*{20}{c}} {\frac{{{n^2} - n}}{2}} \\ k \end{array}} \right)}}$, which equals the probability of $c$ chosen cells in the first row. The sum of the remaining $n-1-c$ cells are i.i.d. uniform, and their sum is Irwin–Hall distribution. However, I have trouble to find the distribution for min/max row sum, as the row sums are not even independent. 

Let $X$ be an $n\times n$ symmetric random matrix whose diagonal is fixed as $1$, and every element in the upper triangle (excluding the diagonal) is drawn from Bernoulli($p$). The elements in the lower triangle is then set to ensure symmetry. First ask a simple question, for such a random matrix, let $\lambda_1(X)$ denotes the largest eigenvalue of $X$, then 

This result is exactly Theorem 4a of Nagata's paper "On rational surfaces, II". Nagata's terminology and notations are a little bit old-fashioned, but it is still very legible ! 

Yes, there is such an example in [Choi, Positive semidefinite biquadratic forms, §4]. It is proven there that the polynomial $$x^4+y^4-2(x^2+y^2)zw+z^2w^2+2(x^2z^2+y^2w^2)$$ is positive semidefinite, but not a sum of squares. 

The description of the Hilbert scheme of complete intersections (obtained by taking in an iterative way open subsets of grassmannian bundles, as explained in the answer above) may be found in part 2.2 of my thesis $URL$ If the distinct degrees are $\delta_1<\dots<\delta_r$, at the $i$-th step you construct a grassmannian bundle corresponding to choosing the equations of degree $\delta_i$ up to multiples of the equations of lower degree, and you remove the closed locus where your equations do not define a complete intersection. Note that this space is smooth. It is not complete unless $k=1$. However, the construction above provides an explicit compactification if $d_1\leq d_2=\dots=d_k$. This compactification is studied in part 2 of arXiv:1111.1589. The Picard group of this Hilbert scheme is easy to describe (its rank increases by one with each grassmannian bundle and it is not changed when removing the small closed loci).The class of the discriminant in this Picard group (i.e. the degrees of the discriminant) is calculated in arXiv:1009.0704 Théorème 1.3, building on Gel'fand, Kapranov and Zelevinsky's work. 

A simulation shows $\frac{\lambda_1(X)}{n}$ looks like Gaussian (10000 samples of $1000\times 1000$ matrices, Bernoulli distribution parameter by 0.7). 

I know in random matrix theory, it is standard to study the distribution of eigenvalues of $\frac{X}{\sqrt n}$, and it obeys semi-circle law. My question is, rather than the largest/smallest eigenvalue of $X/\sqrt n$, 

Suppose $X$ is the original matrix of $n$ columns, and $P$ is the $n \times n$ correlation matrix of $X$. $P$ is symmetric positive semi-definite. Denote the largest eigenvalue of $P$ is $\lambda$, then we must have $\frac{\lambda}{n} \in [0,1]$ and it is called the principal score. Randomly sample $k$ columns $(k <n)$ from $X$ and compute the correlation matrix $P_0$ of this sampled subset. Denote the new principal score as $\frac{\lambda_0}{k}$. The problem is 

I make an experiment over a $100\times 100$ such random matrix, and the histogram of the min row sum divided by 100 (which normalizes the value to $[0,1]$) looks like the following 

According to the book "King of Infinite Space" Coxeter, "tickled his readers with unexpected turns of phrase such as": 

By "a triangulation of $X$", I mean a simplicial complex whose geometric realization is homeomorphic to $X$. Tutte showed that the number of combinatorially distinct triangulations $t(n)$ of the $2$-dimensional sphere on $n+3$ vertices is asymptotically given by $$t(n) \approx \frac{1}{16} \sqrt{\frac{3}{2 \pi}}n^{-5/2} \left( \frac{256}{27} \right)^n.$$ What is known about the number of combinatorially distinct triangulations $t(n,g)$ of the genus $g$ surface? (1) It seems likely to me that for fixed $g$, the growth is still roughly exponential, and maybe even $$ t(n,g) = \exp \left( c_1 n + c_2 \log n + c_3 + o(1) \right)$$ for some constants $c_1, c_2, c_3 \in \mathbb{R}$ which only depend on $g$. For example in the case $g=0$, Tutte's result gives that $c_1 = 256 / 27$, $c_2= -5 / 2$, and $c_3 = \log \left( \frac{1}{16} \sqrt{\frac{3}{2 \pi}} \right)$. Is the growth of $T(n,g)$ always exponential in $n$, and if so can we at least compute the base of the exponent $c_1$ for higher $g$? Updated: The rooted version of this question is answered in the paper: Z.-C. Gao. The number of rooted triangular maps on a surface. Journal of Combinatorial Theory, Series B, 52(2):236 – 249, 1991. For fixed genus $g$, Gao establishes strong results along the lines of the above. (2) At the other extreme, is anything known about the rate of growth of $t(n,g)$ as $n \to \infty$ if $g \approx cn^2$ for some constant $0 < c< 1/12$? (3) Finally, let $T(n)$ be the total number of combinatorial types of triangulated surfaces on $n$ vertices. What is the rate of growth of $T(n)$ as $n \to \infty$? Updated: What I would really like to know is if we can not establish the rate of growth of $T(n)$, is there at least an upper bound of order $$T(n) = n^{o(n)}?$$ Or let $\tilde{T}(n)$ denote the number of labelled triangulated surfaces on $n$ vertices. Is it true that $$\tilde{T}(n) = n^{n+o(n)}?$$ Since $\tilde{T}(n) \le n! T(n)$, the second inequality would follow from the first. Gao's results give that if we assume that the genus $g$ is bounded, then we get the stronger bound $$T(n) = n^{O(n /\log n),}$$ but I still don't know how to handle $g$ growing with $n$.
