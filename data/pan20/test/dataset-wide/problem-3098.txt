Note: Not meant to be taken literally - this is just what they would've meant. The actual word pagan came from Latin, and replaced the native heathen in Middle English. 

Modern Yoga as it is known in the West gained traction in the late 1890s, when Indian monks began transmitting their knowledge to the Western world. Specifically, the influential Swami Vivekananda is often credited with introducing Yoga to the West. 

Thus excluding James II & VII, and his successors, from the thrones of Great Britain. Even this was merely a reflection of the existing political environment and mood of the nation. It created a pro forma exclusion of the Jacobites, but their chances were very minimal either way. 

Ancient Rome had land deeds and registrations. Most of it has long since been lost, but there are still plenty of examples. Note that Roman rule lasted a long time and stretched across three continents; unsurprisingly, the exact details of the system in place differed across time and space. For example, there is a land deed found among the papyri excavated at Nessana, in the Eastern Roman Empire. Probably due to its location, it was written in Greek rather than Latin. The document notified the Land Office that the brothers Abraham and Abu-Zunayn were transferring a piece of ancestral land to a comrade, Thomas. The boundaries of the property were also spelt out. 

Marriage Another aspect of the Petrine reforms concerned marriage. Peter broke the customary monopoly of Muscovite parents in arranging marriages for their children. Whereas before, brides and grooms might only meet for the first time on their wedding night, now Peter demanded freely given consent from both parties. 

The katana style swords remained the standard into and till the end of the Second World War, with another version coming out in 1943. 1: Jowett, Philip S. The Japanese Army 1931-45 (2): 1942-45. Vol. 2. Osprey Publishing, 2002. 

Undeterred, the next year John Jay and another local merchant, Thomas Croft, launched a second expedition with two ships. Croft was later charged in connection of this voyage for shipping salt illegally, but exonerated on the grounds that he was exploring, not trading. The Court of the Exchequer noted in its proceedings that: 

The certificate was stamped in red ink with the state seal, which apparently contained stylised Chinese characters. Reportedly, there were also several Chinese characters near the edges. This might have been decorative patterns misinterpreted by chroniclers, though. Unfortunately there are no known surviving examples of this paper money. Which is unsurprising, considering that the disastrous attempt lasted mere months, and Gaykhatu himself was killed the following year. Most of what we know thus comes from literary records.

"Was ocean-seafaring done by only a small group (a caste? a tribe?) of the wider population?" It depends on how far you mean. Obviously, only vey specially trained navigators, as Tupaia was, could have known how to reach islands hundreds and even a thousand kilometers away. They could not have seen where they were going, and had to rely on specialist knowledge of navigation by sun and the stars, as well as wave and wind patterns. On the other hand, the ability to kayak between nearby islands within a local island group was not remarkable. 

The Book of Rites, in a chapter on Touhu, records an apparently complete composition for drums. Known as the Lu Drums () or the Xue Drums (), it seems to be intended for a match of the semi-ritualistic game of pitch-pot. This is considered the oldest extant musical score in Chinese history. 

However, again, they did not consider expelling all of the Palestinians. For one thing, unlike 1948, there was no huge reserve of Jewish immigrants to settle all this land. For another, Israel believed that maintaining an Arabic population in the West Bank would form a "human bridge" to the other Arab nations. 

During the First World War, King Albert I of Belgium assumed personal command of the Belgian Armed Forces. He wasn't just visiting the front - he went into the fields with his troops and commanded them in the fighting, including at the pivotal Battle of the Yser. I don't know if this counts as "taking part in military actions" - it kind of depends on whether one interprets that as physically fighting vs being a frontline commander. Though according to Wikipedia German troops refrained from shooting him, which would suggest he was rather in the thick of it. At any rate, afterwards King Albert stayed and continued to direct the Yser Front until the end of the war (while the Belgian government evacuated to France). In 1918 the King commanded the Belgian wing of the Allied Hundred Days Offensive, including the Fifth Battle of Ypres. This is just a few months after peace on the Eastern Front. 

This is not to say that Shakespeare's Venice was a racist society (debate on this continues), but evidently the characters are well aware of race, especially as an emotional factor. By implication, so were the intended English audience. Moreover, visually, Othello's black skin is repeatedly associated with something bad. For example the Duke, in an effort to help, tells Brabantio: 

Last but not the least, we know for a fact that it is the consensus of medieval scholars that the Earth is indeed spherical. 

There was kind of a pact from the very start. When the Liberal Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone attempted to pass the First Home Rule Bill, the Conservatives sough support from within Liberal ranks. Liberal members who voted against the Second Reading of the bill were promised non-competition, and 93 of them sided with the Conservatives in the vote. 

Yes. Tsar Nicholas II issued a manifesto on 19 July (i.e. 1 August, New Style) which is considered Russia's declaration of war against Germany. Made in response to the German notice, it was read to a crowd from the balcony of the Winter Palace in Saint Petersburg at 3 p.m. the next day. I can't locate the original text, but here's a translated excerpt: 

One key lies in their treatment of illegitimacy, or bastardy. In Roman society, as is typical of the West in general, illegitimate children had no formal link to their fathers. This was true from the earliest times, and lasted well into the Imperial period before a softening of the laws occurred in the second and third centuries.1 

Europe Not directly related to the question, but European states did not rely on the personal wealth of diplomats, either. Or at least, not exclusively. In the same letter to Monroe, Adams explained that in addition to a base salary: 

Feudal lords have obligations to any liege from whom they hold fiefs in fealty. If a lord holds fiefs in two kingdoms, he is under feudal obligations to both sovereigns. This applies even if a vassal inherits a kingdom and become a king in his own right. For example, the Kings of England remained nominal feudal vassals to the Crown of France for their continental possessions. This is evidenced by such instances as when the Lusignans (who were vassals of King John in his capacity as Count of Poitou), feeling wronged by John, appealed directly to King Philip II in Paris. Moreover, when John refused a royal summon to the French court, Philip declared his French possessions forfeit and seized them. In the other cases, the kings of England paid homage (usually kicking and screaming all the way) to the kings of France over their continental possessions. The most fitting example to your question, though, would be the Dukes of Burgundy. While nominally a French fief, the lords of Burgundy acquired many territories that were nominally part of the Holy Roman Empire. In AD 1416, John the Fearless paid homage to the Emperor for Franche Comté, which was an Imperial fief, while the French King Charles VII later exempted his son from paying homage in an agreement (i.e. normally the Duke of Burgundy was obliged to paid homage). Thus we may observe that, his position in the realm of England notwithstanding, King John was legally subject to the feudal overlordship of Philip with regards to his holdings in France. Of course, note that in practice a vassal with many holdings might be too powerful for the nominal liege to do anything about. 

Politically, this also meant that Sweden, a minor power, was aligned with Nazi Germany. Hitler could get what he needed from Sweden by diplomacy or coercion. Soviet Russia, in contrast, was an ideological enemy and a competing or potentially competing great power. Although it ended badly, that gave Hitler an actual motivation to invade (in addition to his personal issues). Now, if Sweden refused to supply Germany's resource needs, then that would probably have increased the likelihood of an invasion; but Swedish leaders cooperated with Hitler. 

The dialog on HBO is obviously dramatised, but Washington did privately profess to disapprove of such titles. In a letter to David Stuart dated 26 July 1789, Washington wrote that: 

Due to the prestige attached to the veterans, their characteristic hair cut was retained and emulated as the armies demobilised. This was reinforced by the adoption of crew cuts for servicemen during WWII. Obviously there's a great deal of generalisation going on when we speak in such terms as the hair length of entire societies. Some men, even today, kept their hair long. Meanwhile, many women also cut their hair short, especially during the inter-war years. The bob cut for instance became popularised after 1920. This wasn't the first time people cut their hair short, though. As the Industrial Revolution progressed in the 18th century, short hair became attractive to those working with machinery for safety reasons (many women likewise cut their hair short for the same reason when they entered the war factories during the two World Wars). The long, wavy or curly hair portrayed in early centuries thus became a rarity during the 19th century. Nonetheless long hair was not out of the ordinary, and middle to upper class men typical hair lengths remain much longer than would be the norm after the World Wars. Some examples of men with longer hair during the 19th century include: 

In contrast, the Japanese article says the cannons fired blanks and did not result in any deaths. This seems to match what the Naval History and Heritage Command says, hich seems to suggest (based on the wording of "implied") that the guns weren't actually used on the Japanese. 

It is true that Tripoli threatened war twice in February, on the 8th and 16th. Specifically, on the 8th the Bashaw threatened to declare war within 40 days, upon the arrival of incoming presents form Algiers. What actually happened was that the fickle Bashaw soon changed his mind. He decided to postpon the declaration so as to give the United States more time to fold to his bluff write a letter to Algiers first: 

Even at its lowest, the death rate was high enough that a majority of gladiators were likely to die in arena before retirement. That said, the turnover in gladiatorial games was probably not that high, since rank and file gladiators seemed to only fight a few times each year. Some even complained of excessive idleness. A successful gladiator could fight many more games, but were more likely also to be spared for the occasional losses. 

Contrary to the assertions of some, written history was very prominent in China long before the Tang dynasty. A strong culture of writing existed in Ancient China, as attested to most famously by extensive inscriptions on some 150,000 pieces of oracle bones found from the reign of King Wu Ding of Shang (1250-1192 B.C.) onward. Important documentation of historical events begin to appear en masse in inscriptions on bronzewares by the Chou Dynasty (770-255 B.C.). Such archaeological sources provide corroboration for ancient history chronicles as well as primary information. The highly influential Han Dynasty Records of the Grand Historian by Ssuma Chhien (139–86 B.C.), for instance, provided a list of Shang Dynasty kings which were confirmed in the early 1900s by oracle bones excavated from Anyang. The oldest extant fragments of this text date from the Northern and Southern Dynasties period (A.D. 420-589). Canonically, the oldest history text was the Classics of History. It was "edited" together by Confucius (551–479 B.C.) during the Spring and Autumn Era, from a collection of earlier works. The oldest existing copy is a set of excavated bamboo slips, dating from the mid-late Warring States Era (c. 305 B.C.). Traditional versions of the Classics of History date from the Chin Dynasty (A.D. 265–420), after known original copies were destroyed during the Qin Dynasty's suppression, and the early Han Dynasty recreations lost in warfare. Notably, during this period a set of ancient historical annals were discovered in an old tomb: the Bamboo Annals. It appears to be the official history of the State of Wei (403–225 B.C.) from the Warring States era, and recounted history from pre-Xia Dynasty legends to the reign of King Hsiang (319–296 B.C.). Unfortunately most of its contents has been lost. A notable example of a well-preserved ancient Chinese history manuscript comes from a set of annals contained in bamboo slips excavated from the tomb of a government official in Yúnmèng. The Shuihudi_Qin Annals recorded major events of the last century of the Warring States era, leading up to the conquest of the six eastern states by Qin. This set of annals were produced during the short lived Qin Dynasty (221-206 B.C.) and was part of an extensive collection that seemed to have helped the official (whose tomb it was found in) administer the Qin Qmpire's laws. 

Alternatively, if modernity equates high economic productivity, then modernisation could be considered the process of making that possible. Rostow's definition thus defines modernisation as achieving the preconditions for such an "economic take-off": 

Of course, as you pointed out, there's still considerable debate over the exact causes of the Soviet collapse. Which make sense- the Roman Empire fell in the West over 1500 years ago and entire careers are still being made debating why it happened. However, it's important to note that even those who attribute credit to American administrations, generally do not dispute the fact that the Soviet collapsed under domestic tension. No one contends that a foreign invasion ended the Communist government, as Louise Bryant thought would happen. Instead, the primarily debate is whether the Soviet collapse was inevitable, and to what extent the Western Allies added to that pressure. 

The building in question is the Palazzo Eridania, built in 1908 by the architect Richard Haupt. It is situated on Corso Andrea Podestà, 2. As far as I can tell there is no deeper significance in the choice of decorations. 

These were ultimately was agreed to in principle by the Serbian government, but carefully laced with enough conditions so that non-compliance was all but assured. As was the case with point six, these articles were unacceptable because they would have given Austria extreme authority over Serbian internal affairs. Consequently, although it is usually said that Serbia accepted these terms, the Serbian reply actually noted that: 

1873 A mono-metallic, gold standard was introduced only much later by the Coinage Act of 1873. For obvious reasons none of the Founding Fathers had anything to do with it. 

Rather than the stock market crash, the early 1990s recession in the Philippines was actually due to a combination of long term macroeconomic weakness, natural disasters, the oil price shock, and general global economic downturn. Beginning first in 1989, a drought hit the agricultural sector, at the time almost 1/4 of the Philippines economy, hard. Next the islands were struck the twin disasters of the Luzhon Earthquake and Typhoon Ruping. Together they killed over two thousand people and inflicted billions in damages. Then Mount Pinatubo erupted, killing almost another 1000 Filipinos. Agriculture was once again devastated by millions in damages as hundreds of thousands of acres of crops were wiped out along with nearly a million livestock. In addition to the series of unfortunate events, the global economy went into a downturn due to an oil price shock induced by the Gulf War. The weakness of the economy of the Philippines came to the fore under these pressures. Notice how while Thailand and Indonesia did fine, the Filipino economy crashed in the mid 1980s. Dictator Ferdinand Marcos, who was in power until 1980s, left behind a huge debt - over $60 billion. Inflation and unemployment were both well above 10%. The cumulative effect of all these is that the Filipino economy lost $3 billion in 1990 and 1991 - representing about 5% of the Gross National Product at the time. Hence the sudden drop you see on the GDP growth charts. Source: 

On the other hand, the law gave rise to a loophole for freeing slaves, by having someone go to the Praetor and argue a slave was wrongfully held. The owner could then deliberately throw the case, allowing the slave to be declared free.
