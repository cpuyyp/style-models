so in essence the ship was a valid target as blockade runner. And the Lusitania was no exception, strangely everyone remembers the unrestricted submarine warfare, but nobody seemed to notice that Great Britain threw the rulebook of naval warfare into the water. Racism and imperialism. Racism was alive and well during the beginning of the 20th century and Germany was neither an exception nor outstanding in this regard. So accusing them of evil thoughts was ridiculous as any culture can testify which had the dubious pleasure to be civilized by colonial powers. Pointing out the Hun talk of Emperor Wilhelm was first-class hypocrisy because every colonial power was committing atrocities in China. And if someone think that Great Britain belongs to the good guys may be reminded what happened one year later. Endpoint After the horrific war the original viewpoint had deeply changed. It was such an amount of devastation and loss of life that the remaining people were simply stunned. The romantic ideal of war had died. As humans are, they were searching someone who was responsible and Germany was easy to blame. While Germany started the fire, it was definitely not the evil Hun as it was painted by the Allies and the Allies were not so good and blameless as they wanted to be seen. 

The reform corrected the timepoint of Easter, the highest religious ceremony in Christendom. Easter is the first Sunday after the first full moon after spring (fixed on March 21st). Equinox correction (so that the seasons are correct again) needs the true year's length. The Julian year is 0.0078 days (1 day in 128.2 years) longer than the correct year. As the Julian year was too long, Easter was more and more delayed in time. 1582-325 = 1257 years divided by 128.2 yields 9.8 days. Now we do not have 0.8 days, so we are using 10 days, adding effectively an offset of 0.2 days. If you now use the shifted value and calculate backwards as the proleptic Gregorian calendar does, you have this 0.2 offset, so the original 10 days offset will only come a bit before 325, in this case February 28th, 300. 

For all what we know the Mongolian Empire was not simply a collection of brainless brutes, but they had intense knowledge of their opponents: descriptions, maps, information about the technology, culture and especially competing groups of people which can be used to their advantage. Also their military leadership was efficient, knowledgable and adaptable. Khublai Khan was very interested in adapting and fostering Chinese and Muslim knowledge. So why did the Mongols destroy the libraries when they raided Baghdad in 1258? Shouldn't the vast knowledge available about the lands in the West, Europe and Africa and the available technology have tempted them to plunder and evaluate the scriptures for their own purposes? 

To be frank, it seems the author has no clue. [...], he didn't have friends or relatives in high places, [...] He was in the Beer Hall Putsch which was promoted by Erich Ludendorff, the former German General of World War I and idolized as "the brain of the war". While not leading anymore, Ludendorff had tremendous connections and support. His influence was so great that Ludendorff was acquitted despite being the leading force of the Putsch. He was a penniless immigrant True insofar as he entered Germany after leaving Vienna 1914. But not in the war (soldier pay) and definitely not after entering politics. When Hitler appealed to the German voters and asked for their trust, he could muster only one argument in his favor: his experiences in the trenches had taught him what you can never learn at university, at general headquarters or at a government ministry. People followed him, and voted for him because they identified with him, and because they too believed that the world is a jungle, and that what doesn't kill us only makes us stronger. Sorry to be blunt: Bullshit. First of all: The German military had a comment: an unspoken rule book what is appropiate for a soldier. Bragging or pointing out the own role in the war was out of order. People followed him because he was a demagogue and a good speaker. He knew how to push the lizard buttons: Animosity against an common enemy, scapegoating, giving easy to understand destinations and worldviews. Giving people the hope of a comeback and revenge of Germany against the perceived humiliating defeat and the Treaty of Versailles. At least one thing is pointing in the right direction: During the fight for power there was an influential party almost exclusively supported by soldiers: The Stahlhelm. Hitler had naturally as WWI veteran automatically its sympathies. It is also important to know that "German voters" were not unison. Communists, Nazis and the middle-class voters were hostile to each other and had very different ideas how Germany should continue. At another point the author points out Hitler's undistinguished military service record over four years. How did he explain that Hitler was awarded the Iron Cross First Class ? While the number of crosses were inflated, still there were only 200 000 crosses IC 1st for 13 000 000 soldiers, making it 1 for 50 soldiers. I am not a historian, but from a German perspective the books sounds like badly researched kitsch. 

The Battle of the Long Sault While the historiography gives many conflicting details and claims without sources (Some historians said...), I refer to the writings by contemporary witness Pierre-Esprit Radisson. According to him the French settlements got intel from trappers, mountainman and friendly Indians that the Iroquois were preparing one massive assault on the french settlements which were allied with the Hurons and Algonquin. Approximately 1000 warriors were moving in to assault the settlements and burn them to the ground. Adam Dollard des Ormeaux made the desperate decision to move against the Iroquois with only 17 of voluntary militia. He absolutely knew that it was a suicide mission, but he intended to inflict such heavy losses that the Iroquois would think twice to continue the attack on the settlements which had more weapons and men available. Every volunteer sweared to God that he would not give up and fight until the bitter end. For this reason Dollard had much more muskets and gunpowder than a normal hunting party and also grape shot. The allied Hurons were also an important factor that the numerical superiority was not so overwhelming. The Wikipedia article is silent why such a small force was capable to hold off 200 Iroquois warriors for several days. The Iroquois were used to ambush the enemy party once they fired their muskets because the reloading time was slow. Their problem was that Dollard had three muskets available for each shooter and each shooter had one reloader who was reloading the muskets as fast as possible, so they were able to repel the attacks and inflict heavy losses. After a backup of 500 warriors arrived and started a human wave attack, the defenders switched to grapeshot and inflicted horrible losses. While they finally succumbed, Dollard was successful: His strategy inflicted such losses that the Iroquois give up to attack the settlements.
