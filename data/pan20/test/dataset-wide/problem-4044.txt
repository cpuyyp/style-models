There's a paper of H. L. Royden "Holomorphic fiber bundles with hyperbolic fiber", Proc. AMS, Volume 43, Number 2, April 1974 which proves "Theorem: The holomorphic fiber bundles with hyperbolic fiber M and base B are in natural one-to-one correspondence with the homomor- phisms of the fundamental group of B into the group of biholomorphic automorphisms of M onto itself. " In other words, it appears that holomorphic disc bundles are naturally flat. Note: the first projection $p_1: \mathbb{B}^2\to \mathbb{D}$ of the real 4-ball to the disc is not a holomorphic bundle of discs, because it is not locally trivial. To see why, suppose we have an isomorphism $f:p_1^{-1}(D)\to D\times \mathbb{D}$ of bundles over a sufficently small disc $D$ of radius $r<1$ around zero. Write $f(x,y) = (x, f_2(x,y))$. Now choose $y_0\in p_1^{-1}(0)$ with $\sqrt{1-r^2} <|y_0|< 1$, so that it is sent via the second projection $p_2:\mathbb{B}^2\to\mathbb{D}$ outside the disc of radius $\sqrt{1-r^2}$. By assumption, $p_1$ has a section $s$ over $D$ passing through $y_0$ -- this is just a level set of $f_2$. Composing, we obtain $ h=p_2\circ s : D\to \mathbb{D}$. I claim $h$ fails the maximum modulus principle for holomorphic functions. Why? Any circle of sufficiently large radius in $D$ must be sent by $h$ inside a disc of radius strictly less than $|y_0|$ around $0$. Meanwhile, the center of the disc $D$ is sent to $p_2(y_0)$, which has norm equal to $|y_0|$. This goes against the maximum principle or the Gauss mean value theorem, if you like. 

You are certainly allowed to do this and you will get a right derived functor because you are looking at resolutions $G^\bullet \to I^\bullet$ (note how the arrow is pointing to the right!). This works because any two injective resolutions $I^\bullet$ of $G^\bullet$ are homotopy equivalent, so you can use this to compute the right derived functor of absolutely any functor. However, the derived tensor product is defined as a left derived functor. Maybe this will help: the derived tensor product can be computed by taking a K-flat resolution in either variable. Thus you can first take a K-flat resolution $F^\bullet \to F$ (if $F$ is a sheaf this can be just your usual bounded above complex of flat modules resolving $F$) and then $Tot(F^\bullet \otimes G^\bullet)$ computes the derived tensor product. You don't even have to replace $G^\bullet$; in fact, since now $F^\bullet$ is K-flat you can reoplace $G^\bullet$ by any quasi-isomorphic complex and you get the same answer in the derived category. 

Let $f: M \to N$ be a smooth maps between smooth manifolds. Then $f$ is a submersion (by definition) if its differential is also surjective. Now suppose $f$ is surjective. Is it possible that the surjective map $f$ fails to be a submersion on a set in $N$ of measure non-zero? If so, what is such a map? Suppose the manifolds $M$ and $N$ are non-compact. Does this change the previous answer? Thanks! 

The answer of Theo basically says it all what the exponential is concerned, but I maybe can shed some light regarding the optimization perspective. Let $M$ be your Lie group and suppose it is a subgroup of $\textrm{GL}_n$. Now, if you want to solve \[ \min f(x) \quad \textrm{s.t. $x \in M$} \] by an iterative method, one usually uses a so-called smooth retraction map \[ R_x: T_x M \to M. \] to replace your current approximation $x$ to $x_+ := R_x(\Delta)$. Think for example of doing a line-search $R_x(-t \textrm{ grad}_x f)$ for $t>0$ where $\textrm{ grad}_x f$ is the Riemannian gradient of $f$. (The retraction map has to fulfill some properties, in order for this to work, likes smoothness and being a first-order approximation of the geodesics (see below).) Due to the left (or right) action of a Lie group on itself by multiplication, the exponential mapping at the identity $\exp$ can be transported to get a retraction at $x$ as $x\exp$. As Theo already explained, $\exp$ does not need to be a global diffeomorphism, but that is not needed for optimization, since we perform updates locally. Another typical choice for $R_x$ are the geodesics in $x$. For some metrics, the $\exp$ coincides with the geodesics (for instance, bi-invariant metrics), but not always. One can also use cheaper alternatives for $R_x$ if your are only concerned with optimization. A nice reference for this retraction-based optimization on manifolds (and so, also Lie groups) is $URL$ . 

It appears these lattices can be described as a kind of twisted product of the simple lattice $[n]=\{0,1,2,\ldots, n-1\}$ with the usual order. To construct the lattice of subsequences of the sequence of weakly decreasing positive integers $(k_1,\ldots, k_N)$, let $m(k)$ be the multiplicity of the integer $k$ in the given sequence and form the product $$[d(1)]\times \cdots \times [d(N)],$$ equipped with the order $(a_1,\ldots, a_N)\leq (b_1,\ldots, b_N)$ iff $$a_N\leq b_N$$ $$a_N+a_{N-1}\leq b_N + b_{N-1}$$ $$\ldots$$ $$a_N+\cdots + a_1\leq b_N+\cdots + b_1.$$ For example, for the sequence $(3,2,1,1)$, we have $d(1)=2$ and $d(2)=d(3)=1$, so that the lattice is given by $[2]\times [1]\times [1]$, with the order given above. This must be a standard construction in poset/lattice theory, please let me know if you've seen it somewhere. 

You may already know this but there is this really fun paper by Bruce Reznick where he finds some interesting rational curves on Fermat hypersurfaces. For example conics on the degree 5 Fermat hypersurface in P^3. See Matt Deland's thesis for more on these examples (page 52 ff) and more on rational curves on hypersurfaces. As was mentioned in the comments, algebraic geometers working over algebraically closed fields know very little for any particular hypersurface and quite a bit (part of it conjectural) for a general hypersurface. Hope you can help us! 

You can read about this in many references, for example in Section Tag 06Y7. It also gives some refences. 

There is a lot of work done about this by people such as Raynaud, Harbater, Stevenson, Bouw, Wewers, Osserman and others (please edit here if you want to add more). An example result very close to what you are looking for is Theorem 1.4 of the paper Linear series and existence of branched covers by Brian Osserman. You can also find the paper on the arxiv. 

I've had difficulty finding sources which treat the classification of holomorphic disc bundles over (compact and noncompact) Riemann surfaces. Note that by "bundle", I mean a holomorphic fiber bundle, which means it is locally holomorphically trivial. I'm really just looking for information about holomorphic disc bundles, but if you want a specific question: What is the classification of holomorphic disc bundles over a Riemann surface? 

GC Lie groups: these are Lie groups equipped with GC structures compatible with the multiplication map. Holomorphic Poisson Lie groups are an example of this, but there are others. For example, the known examples of generalized Kahler structures on compact even-dimensional semisimple Lie groups (we just need a bi-invariant metric, not all hypotheses are necessary) consist of two commuting GC structures, one of which is multiplicative in the above sense, and the other of which is a GC homogeneous space over the GC Lie groupd defined by the first. This situation will be familiar to those in Poisson Lie Group theory, and this is joint work in progress with Jiang-Hua Lu. David is of course correct in his statement that GC actions of GC Lie groups would then define GC action groupoids. B-symplectic groupoids as described in $URL$ These are, first and foremost, symplectic groupoids, but they have an extra 2-form making them GC Lie groupoids. Any holomorphic Poisson groupoid is an example of a generalized complex groupoid. For example, if Z is a Poisson manifold, then $Z\times Z$ is a Poisson groupoid and hence a generalized complex groupoid. 

Are you sure you need the distance function $\|XX^T-YY^T\|_2$? If not, the solution to \[ \min {\|E\|: E \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}, (X+E)^T(X+E) = I } \] for the 2-norm and the Frobenius norm is the polar decomposition; see, e.g., section 4 in $URL$ . Maybe you do want $\|XX^T-YY^T\|_2$ as distance function because of the equivalence by the orthogonal group. In that case you maybe want to rephrase your problem on the Grassmann manifold on linear subspaces. In fact, the Stiefel manifold with the orthogonal group factored out is exactly the Grassmann manifold. There is a nice paper about this: $URL$ . 

Hello all, I recently came across the following Theorem in Gibson (Singular points of smooth mappings, 1979). Since I haven't seen this result somewhere else and this reference is not so widespread, I was wondering if it is correct, known or trivial? Theorem B4 in Gibson79: Let $\phi: G \times M \to M$ be a smooth action of a Lie group $G$ on a smooth manifold $M$. Suppose that the action is semi-algebraic (i.e., the graph of $\phi$ is a semi-algebraic set). Then all the orbits are smooth submanifolds of $M$. (Smooth means $C^\infty$; smooth submanifold means a differential manifold that is embedded.) The proof goes as follows. The orbit at $x \in M$ is semi-algebraic by Tarski-Seidenberg. Every non-void semi-algebraic has at least a one neighbourhood where it is a submanifold in $M$. Since orbits are homogeneous by the action of $G$, this neigbourhood extends to the whole orbit. Thanks! 

Consider $J^{g-1}$, the variety of degree $g-1$ line bundles on a compact Riemann surface of genus $g$. Recall that $J^{g-1}$ is a torsor for the Jacobian, thus has dimension $g$. We can produce elements in $J^{g-1}$ by choosing $g-1$ points $p_1,\ldots,p_{g-1}$ and constructing the associated line bundle to the divisor $p_1+\cdots+p_{g-1}$. In this way, we obtain a $g-1$-dimensional family of elements of $J^{g-1}$, forming the so-called $\Theta$ divisor. Elements of the $\Theta$ divisor may be distinguished from other points in $J^{g-1}$ by the fact that they represent line bundles admitting sections, i.e. $h^0(L)\neq 0$. For degree $g-1$ line bundles, the Riemann-Roch theorem gives $h^0(L)=h^1(L)$, so over $J^{g-1}$ we see that $h^0(L),h^1(L)$ are generically zero and jump along the $\Theta$ divisor. One might imagine that there are vector bundles $V,W$ over $J^{g-1}$ of the same rank, with fibres over $L\in J^{g-1}$ given by Dolbeault $0$- and $1$-forms with coefficients in $L$ respectively, together with a bundle map $\overline{\partial}:V\rightarrow W$ which is generically an isomorphism but drops rank along $\Theta$; then $\det \overline{\partial}$ would be a section of a line bundle $\det V^*\otimes\det W$ over $J^{g-1}$ which cuts out $\Theta$. This line bundle turns out to be a well-defined object called the determinant line bundle and it was introduced by Quillen. Quillen's construction of the line bundle proceeds by replacing the family of (2-term) Dolbeault complexes parametrized by $J^{g-1}$ by a quasi-isomorphic family of finite-dimensional (2-term) complexes and taking the determinant line bundle of this. The finite-dimensional replacement for the Dolbeault complex is given by the Dolbeault operator acting on forms lying in the first few eigenspaces of the Laplacian, roughly speaking. Then as we move along $J^{g-1}$, some of the eigenvalues may hit zero and we have a jump of $h^0(L)$. For a good list of references for the above, see determinant line bundle (nlab). My question: What is a simple, modern construction of the determinant line bundle on $J^{g-1}$, perhaps one which uses the tools of algebraic geometry? It may well be tautological from some point of view, in which case I would probably be unsatisfied. Also, if you wish to rhapsodize on determinant line bundles, please feel free. My motivation: Many of the classic papers by Beauville, Narasimhan, Ramanan etc. on moduli of vector bundles expend a lot of effort working with determinant line bundles and extracting information from them in quite ad-hoc and clever ways. I'd like to understand these better. 

Suppose that $\mathcal{X}$ is an algebraic stack which is limit preserving on objects over $S$. Suppose that $U \to \mathcal{X}$ is a smooth surjective map from a scheme. Then $U \to S$ is limit preserving by the results of Section Tag 06CT. Thus $U$ is locally of finite presentation over S (for example by the reference you gave). This exactly means that $\mathcal{X} \to S$ is locally of finite presentation. I didn't check the direction you said was OK, but if it is, then this also means there is no difference between "limit preserving on objects" and "limit preserving" for algebraic stacks over schemes. There is a difference in general (for stacks in groupoids over schemes for example). Anyway, this is one of the many things missing from the Stacks project (thanks for pointing it out). The Stacks project takes contributions (by email or via git pull requests) if you are so inclined.
