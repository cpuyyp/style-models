I don't think there is a separate "historical epidemiology" field. Sources Major epidemics are chronicled just like wars - written record is the main source of information. Death records - both papers (when preserved) and cemetery headstones - may provide additional statistical evidence. For prehistorical deceases, the main sources of information are the genetic analyses of pathogens and the human immune systems. Epidemics in the modern sense did not occur because humans lived in mostly isolated communities. Research Recurring epidemics, like flu, are subject to intensive medical research; e.g.: 

It is pretty hard to prove a negative in the social sciences (consider how many people still believe the The Protocols of the Elders of Zion hoax!) but I would bet that Brzezinski never said anything like that - this is an extremely stupid thing to say, and I don't think he is that stupid. The "New world order" was the expression used by Bush-1 to describe the era of collaboration with Russia in the aftermath of the decline of communism, especially around the Gulf War. The excitement about the friendly relationships with Russia was quite genuine. 

Backstage I think you place far too much emphasis on ideology. The right/left dichotomy is fairly euro-centric. The differences between Nationalists/Chiang vs Communists/Mao were quite unlike the differences between Nazis/Hitler and Communists/Thälmann. E.g., I seem to recall that Mao and Chiang cooperated against the Soviet invasion of Xinjiang. Can you imagine Thälmann cooperating with Hitler against Stalin? Or maybe Henlein cooperating with Beneš against Hitler? (no reference, sorry). Chinese were united is their resentment of the humiliations they suffered throughout the 19th century at the hands of Europeans and wanted to speedily modernize their country economically (and thus militarily) so that it would take the place on the world scene commensurate with its self-assessment. IOW, the difference between Mao and Chiang was tactical (how to Make China Great Again) while the difference between Right and Left in the European eyes is strategic (what are the proper priorities a society ought to have). The implacability of the conflict between Mao and Chiang is more circumstantial (ethnic differences compounded by the conflict with Japan, note that the "one ethnic China" is another euro-centric mirage, in fact, China has many dialects) than principled (ideological disagreements). Answer The above sets the stage to the answer: since Spain was remote, relatively backward and poor and thus could not contribute much to the fight of Chiang against Japan (and warlords, including Mao), Chiang's attitude was supremely indifferent. He would go through whatever motions were expedient (e.g., since he was supported by the USSR, he would express indignation at whatever Franco did and support of whatever the Communists did, but nothing else). There were about 100 Chinese in the International Brigades, organized by CCP, and I am sure neither Chiang not Franco cared much. Spain had its own indifference - since they could not affect the Chinese war and could not hope for any help from them, the relationships were probably tenuous at best. They had a skeleton crew in Shanghai International Settlement of course, but not much more. Further It's hard to prove a negative (in this case, "nothing interesting existed between Spain and China in the 1930-ies") outside of Math. You might want to look at books by Paul Preston about Spain (e.g., Revolution and War in Spain, 1931-1939). On the other hand, China at War: An Encyclopedia by Xiaobing Li does not mention or in the context of the Civil War at all. 

Note that the numbers here are not necessarily true (just like all official Soviet data). PS. When making manpower comparison, you can easily dig yourself into a sinkhole. E.g., from the POV of productive work, Germany could draw upon not just Germany, but France, Denmark, Norway, Italy, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Rumania. However, USSR was also helped by US and Britain. However a Germany was also fighting in Atlantic and North Africa. However, US was also fighting Japan... PPS. When making rough estimates like @TomAu does, one must account for evacuation which, in the case of USSR, had truly gargantuan scales. 

Did they send an official letter of congratulations to the German government? Did they cover the event in the newspapers (and what was the tilt of the coverage)? 

So: pound sterling was silver; guinea was created as a gold coin equivalent to it, but then the commodity prices diverged. See also Bimetallism. Social Guinea was used to quote doctor's fees et al: 

Summary This is the official Soviet/Russian propaganda line, repeated over and over since 1945. The Western Allies simply did not have the resources necessary to land in France until 1944 - given their other ongoing commitments all over the globe. Details Before such a landing could be successful, the Allies had to achieve air and naval superiority, which takes much more time than achieving superiority in ground forces. E.g., it takes 2 years to train a good fighter pilot, and 3.5 years between laying the keel of a battleship and it commissioning. Meanwhile, the Western Allies fought Japan on the Pacific and Germany and Italy in North Africa. They landed in Europe in 1943 and forced Italy to surrender. They fed and armed the USSR and fought the longest campaign of the war. Underlying Currents This attitude of SU/Russia betrays a fundamental difference in attitude towards their allies in particular and other countries in general. The paranoid conviction that the other countries hate Russia is pervasive throughout the Russian history, and it was preserved intact during the Communist rule as the doctrine of "the hostile capitalist surroundings". While the Western Allies tried to build genuine friendship, the Russian representatives in Britain slept with revolvers under their pillows (as described by Churchill). The western attitude started with a wild hope in June 1941, then plunged into a horror that the Red Army will collapse, then into a fear that Stalin will make a deal with Hitler (like the Molotov-Ribbentrop) - but it was always a hopeful friendship. This hope, indeed, started to wither when the West realized that Stalin had no intention to fulfill it commitments to democratic elections in the Eastern Europe, but that was a slow and reluctant change. 

For a pyramid to be "half an octahedron", its height must be the width divided by . Examination of the List of Egyptian pyramids shows that this is not the case. E.g., 

WW1 was billed as "the war to end all wars". The mood at the end was that this would indeed be a watershed event after which wars will become a thing of the past and the world will enjoy a peaceful and equitable future. The Treaty of Versailles was supposed to be the permanent foundation for this future. Specifically, 

As you mention yourself, the common expectation was a quick triumph, and such atmosphere is quite conductive to militant patriotism flaring up. 

Wikipedia says that Jews were acceptable to the Zaporozhian Cossacks until they became an economic threat in 17th century. The idea was briefly resurrected by Potemkin a century later. 

Spanish Civil War: one can argue that republicans were more liberal Chinese Civil War: one can argue that kuomitang was more liberal Russian Civil War: some anti-bolshevik factions were fighting under the slogan of support of the Russian Constituent Assembly - more liberal WW2: one can easily argue that USSR was less liberal than the 3rd Reich. 

I think you are exaggerating the ideological transformation brought by Meiji Restoration. The main emphasis was economic modernization, not social equity. 

They might have installed a telephone line to arrange for the May 1st meeting between Krebs and Chuikov to negotiate a surrender of Berlin garrison. Hitler was already dead and Goebbels died that afternoon, opening the way to the surrender. 

The European theater had more and better roads, so jeeps were quite on par with the new unproven technology. The Germans had better AA facilities. 

Heer had an excellent tradition of troop replenishment (training reinforcements before throwing them into battle). However, as the war progressed, Heer started to founder under the mounting pressure of numeric and material superiority of the Red Army (also, the losses among battle veterans mounted and the troops became weaker). Hitler, faced with a cognitive dissonance (his Ubermenschen are being defeated by Untermenschen), chose to blame the Heer (from privates to Generals) and decided to form Waffen SS (which were similar to Guard troops in other countries). Heer resented this because it starved it of men and materiel and reduced its prestige. Thus the German Generals tend to claim in their memoirs that Waffen SS were poorly trained (probably true), better equipped (probably true), less battle-effective (hard to verify), and more prone to war crimes (not necessarily true - not because Waffen SS was innocent, but because Heer was just as guilty). Incidentally, this was not the only case of German land forces fragmentation, the other being Luftwaffe Field Divisions. No matter what Germany would have done after 1942 could have changed the final outcome. They could have been more efficient, but the end result would have been the same. 

USSR was an existential ideological enemy for Hitler, somewhat like "Carthago delenda est". It was also supposed to be the source of Lebensraum. It was also a military threat (especially to the Romanian oil fields!) - there was no doubt that it would attack at the first opportunity. It was also perceived as the last hope of Britain - Hitler assumed that when USSR is destroyed, Britain would sue for peace. 

The prevailing doctrine of Mercantilism advocated free internal trade and high external tariffs, so the Commerce Clause was an important indicator that the US was a single country. 

This is an exaggeration: a tribe hunting deer will probably have little to fall back on, especially in winter. 

The Wahhabi ideology started as a revivalist movement (return to the roots) and quickly became strongly conservative, emphasizing intolerance not just to other religions, but to other variants of Islam. This provides a tool for dealing with the dissenters (accuse them of deviations from the party line). Also, the emphasis on the early "Rightly Guided Caliphs" justifies the (almost) absolute monarchy. Thus the ideology suites the political elite because it justifies their monopoly on power and provides the tools to keep it, so it will not be changed from above. The people are sufficiently religious and the government is sufficiently oil-rich to prevent any attempt of a change from below (by maintaining a sufficiently high standard of living for the locals and suppressing any possible unrest among the guest workers). Another issue to consider is that Saudi Arabia controls the Muslim holy sites, so the country have to present an "orthodox image" to the pilgrims. Wahhabism's "unpopularity with the rest of Muslims" actually helps because neither (mainstream) Sunnis nor Shiites have to fear that the other side takes over the holy sites.
