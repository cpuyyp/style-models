The moon does attract more particles. But more importantly, those particles hit the moon with velocities of the order of the Moon's escape velocity, 2.4 km/s. That's a very powerful sandblaster... 

Ignoring the impossibility of Jupiter going solar: Assume that Jupiter turns into duplicate of the Sun in terms of energy output. Energy transmitted to the earth follows an inverse-square law. Since Jupiter is, at best, 4 times farther from the Earth than the Sun, Jupiter will supply the Earth with, at most, 1/16 the energy that the Sun supplies, for an increase of a bit more than 6%, at the most. By comparison, between aphelion and perihelion, the Sun-Earth distance increases from around 147 million kilometers to around 152 million kilometers. This implies a seasonal energy input change of about 7%, that we experience now every year... 

Since the sun is opaque, there is no such thing as seeing clouds behind it. The picture seems to show clouds of different densities passing in front of the sun. 

You see an astronomer inserting a plate in the camera at the 200 inch prime focus. Close to his right thumb you see a vertical tube. This is an eyepiece that is used to examine a star at the edge of the prime focus image outside of the plate dimensions. The astronomer will watch this star through the eyepiece and manually adjust the tracking of the telescope to keep the star stationary. For hours. In the dark. With no source of heat. And no plumbing. So we have an eyepiece being used in parallel with a photographic plate. It may be a stretch, but... 

So, suppose I'm standing next to, but safely away from, some train tracks. As the train approaches, sounding its whistle constantly, the pitch will appear to increase until it reaches me, upon which I will briefly hear the whistle's 'rest pitch' (the pitch of the whistle as if I were aboard the train), then it would decrease as the train moves away. Thus, the lower the pitch, the further away the train is. I hope that's right. So, if we know the rest frequency of galaxy GN-z11, its measured frequency indicates how far away it is from earth. Trouble is, how do we know what the rest frequency of light coming from this distant galaxy is? 

If we suppose we and everything in the universe is perfectly flat. That is, we have width and depth, but no height. And we are situated on the surface of a balloon blowing up with air and expanding "outwards". Us flat people can move around on the surface of our balloon but not through it, in much the same way we navigate around the earth, in a plane say. No matter where something is situated on the surface of the balloon, one point is no more central than any other point. In other words, the surface of a balloon (the "universe") has no centre. Is this why we say it makes no sense to say the universe has a centre, or edge for that matter, or is this analogy stupid? 

The CCD has no way of recording the direction, the point in the sky, from which a photon is coming. Say you point your mirror-less telescope at the Moon. Every point on the moon's surface would be reflecting photons onto every part of the CCD at the same time. You've just created an expensive, sensitive, ambient light meter. There would be no image information whatsoever. 

Yes... In the scenario you describe, you (and the air) will remain at rest, while the torus speeds up. One hopes there are no radial partitions, or, if there are, one comes along to pick you up fairly early in the session. Unfortunately, the rotating torus will impart its velocity to the air in contact with all the irregularities in the wall/floor/ceiling. This would then be transferred to the rest of the air. Floating there, you would experience a very slight breeze blowing you in the direction of rotation of the station. This in turn would cause you to slowly drift radially outward, until you hit the floor and rolled along until you were at rest with respect to the floor. Even if the station is not running up from zero rotation rate, you can experience some strange effects. If the station is big enough, you can travel with low energy. Simply run against the rotation of the station. When you are running at the rotation speed, lift your feet, and drift in place until your destination comes along. Put down you feet, start running, and slow to a walk. Be careful, though. If you face in the wrong direction and run at that same speed, your apparent weight will quadruple as you crash to the floor... 

I've always been stumped with the question of what lies beyond the universe, and I've come to the firm conclusion - void (i.e. completely empty). Does it make sense then to think of the universe as a finite 'blob' of atoms (the completely full) flying around each other in nothing? Furthermore, and more importantly, does it have a shape like a sphere? 

Is the universe much like the earth, in that if I were to travel in one and only one direction, I'd eventually end up where I started from? 

The Sun is a fiery mass of colliding particles. We still know very little about what it is. Could it possibly be the output of the sun fluctuates, like our weather, from one extreme to another. From hot durations to cold durations and back again. I think global warming is the result of higher amounts of solar energy being released from the Sun; that's why it's getting hotter here. I believe the question is important to all people on planet Earth, par excellence; is humanity, namely our consumption of fossil fuels, the cause of our predicament? 

From another question I posted, I learned that not only was matter created from the Big Bang, but more importantly, space itself. What does it mean for space to be created? Does it exist in the same way substances exist? In other words, what do we mean by 'space exists?'
