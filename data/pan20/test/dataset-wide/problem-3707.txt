I am not an expert, but what I think I know on the subject is: For $GL_n$, the local Langlands conjecture has long been known by work of Laumon, Rapoport and Stuhler (Inventiones Math, 1993). Of course, in this case, even the global correspondence is now known, due to the Fields-Medal-winning work of Laurent Lafforgue. For general reductive groups, the local Langlands correspondence is not known at this date but there is movement right now. Vincent Lafforgue (Laurent's younger brother) has recently released a paper proving the direction "automorphic --> Galois" of the global correspondence. In this paper, he announces a work in preparation of himself and Genestier aiming at establishing the local Langlands correspondence for reductive groups. So when this paper is released, the answer to your question may well be "solved!". 

Let $\pi_1, \dots, \pi_r$ be the irreducible representations appearing as a sub quotient in $V^-$. Note that none of these irreducible representation appear in $V/V^-$ because these rep. have negative HT weights and $V/V^-$ non-negative HT weights. Now consider the functor $F$ from the category of $L$-representations of $G$ to itself which to a representation $V$ attaches the largest sub-representation $F(V)$ of $V$ whose all irreducible sub quotients are among $\pi_1,\dots,\pi_r$. Note that this definition makes sense because the sum of two sub-representations of $V$ whose only irreducible subquotients are among $\pi_1,\dots,\pi_r$ has the same property (so $F(V)$ is well-defined), and the image of such a sub representation by a morphism also has this property (so $F$ is a functor). Also it is easy to see that the functor $F$ is additive and left-exact. By the remark made in the first paragraph, $F(V)=V^-$. Now let $V_A$ be a deformation of $V$ to an Artinian local $L$-algebra $A$ of residue field . $L$, $M$ a finite $A$-module. I claim that $\dim_L F( V_A \otimes_A M) \leq (\dim_L M) d'$. Indeed, $\dim_L M$ is the length of $M$ as an $A$-module, and $M$ has a filtration of length $\dim_L M$ whose graded pieces are isomorphic to $L$. Thus $V_A \otimes_A M$ is, as a representation of $G$ over $L$, a successive extension of $\dim_L M$ copies of $V$, and the result follows by left-exacness of $F$. Now assuming your hypothesis, $F(V_{A'})$ has dimension $(\dim A') d'$. One has an exact sequence $$ 0 \rightarrow F(V_A) \rightarrow F(V_{A'}) \rightarrow F(V_{A'} \otimes_{A'} A'/A $$ The last term has dimension at most $d'(\dim A'/A)$ by the claim applied to $M=A'/A$, the middle term exactly $d' \dim A'$, so the first term $F(V_A)$ has dimension at least $d'(\dim A)$. But by the claim applied to $M=A$, it has dimension at most $d' \dim A$. Hence $$\dim F(V_A) = d' (\dim A).$$ Also, by functoriality, $F(V_A)$ is a sub $A$-module of $V_A$, and its image in $V$ is just $F(V)=V^-$, so we deduce easily that $F(V_A)$ is free, hence direct summand (over a local artinian ring, ant free sub-module of a free module is direct summand), hence $V_A /F(V_A)$ is projective, hence free as well. So $F(V_A)$ is the sub representation you were looking for. 

Let $A$ be complete noetherian local ring with maximal ideal $m$ and residue field $A/m$ a finite field (in other words, $A$ is a noetherian compact local ring) 

1.-- in the $Gl_2$-case, $\pi$ is of CM type if it is the automorphic induction of a Grossencharacter of a CM extension K of $F$. In terms of the Galois representation of $Gal(\bar F/F)$ attached to $\pi$, that means that $\pi$ is not the induced representation from a character of a subgroup $Gal(\bar F/K)$ of index $2$, where $K$ is a CM extension of $F$. In the general case, the notion of CM stratifies into many different notions. Read things about the Mumford-Tate groups for more about this. 2.-- because already in the $F=\mathbb{Q}$-case, the Sato-Tate conjecture excludes the CM case. 

More precisely: (a) Fixing a prime number $l$ which is regular in the sense of Kummer, then it is always true that $H^1(G,\chi)$ is of dimension 1 or 0 according to the parity. This follows from Mazur-Wiles's proof of the main conjecture of Iwasawa, and the fact that the $l$-adic zeta function has no zero when $l$ is regular. (a') For a fixed $l$, which is non-regular, then the same result will be true except for a finite, non-zero, number of exceptions, where $dim \ H^1(G,\chi)$ will be higher. (same argument, using the fact that the $l$-adic zeta function has finitely many zero in any case, being an Iwasawa function, but has at least one zero, since $l$ is not regular). (b) When $\chi = \chi_{cycl}^n \epsilon$, where $n$ is an integer, $\epsilon$ a finite order character, then it is expected that $H^1(G,\chi)$ has dimension $0$ or $1$ according to the parity. This is even a theorem except if $n$ is negative and $\chi$ even (and hypothesis (1) above is satisfied, that is $n \neq 0,1$). This is a deep result of Soulé combined with some lemmas of Bloch-Kato. As far as I know, these are the only known results. In the cases we have left aside (excluded by our hypothesis (1)), the answer may be more complicated. For instance $H^1(G,\chi_{cycl})$ is of infinite dimension, as is easy to see using the Kümmer's exact sequence. For a more thorough discussion, please see my lecture notes on the Bloch-Kato conjecture for the Hawaii 2009's conference, available on my web page. 

This question might be too elementary for MO, in which case I would gladly move it to math.stackexchange.com Consider Tarski's axiomatization of Euclidean Geometry. It is stated in the wikipedia page linked and many other places that Tarski proved this first-order theory to be complete and consistent. My question concerns consistency: the proofs I have seen in model-theoretic literature reduce to the triviality that Euclidean geometry has a model in set theory (namely $\mathbb R^2$), so these proofs are actually proofs of the relative consistency of Euclidean Geometry with respect to set theory. But surely there must be a proof of the consistency of Tarski's axioms using only a considerably less powerful theory than set theory (whose consistency may itself be in doubt). 

By independent interest I mean some group interesting for mathematicians outside of the theory of pro-$p$-groups, for instance the Braid groups $B_n$, the group $Out(F_n)$, fundamental groups of interesting manifolds, etc... not some group 

If yes, will they be easy to implement quickly when quantum computers appear ? If not, are people working on this ? have we hope to find such algorithms anytime soon ? Is there some theoretical obstruction to the existence of such algorithm ? 

The key word here is "general type" which is a geometric condition (defined for a proper smooth variety as the canonical divisor $K$ being big, that is the order magnitude of the dimensions of the space of global section of the bundle $L(nK)$ is $n^d$ as $n$ goes to infinity), which for proper smooth curves is equivalent to the Mordell's condition $g \geq 2$. Under this condition (which some experts in algebraic geometry may discuss in more detail that I can -- for example is it a condition that can be read on $X(\mathbb C)$ as topological space like for curves?), you get strong results on the number of rational points. Of course this conjecture is wide-open, except in the cases of curves or more generally subvarieties of abelian varieties, proved by Faltings. 

Let me first define the algebra $M$ I am talking about: let us fix a prime $p$, an integer $N$ not divisible by $p$. For $k$ an integer, let me call $N_k$ the $\mathbb{Z}$-module of modular forms of level $\Gamma_0(N)$ (or $\Gamma_1(N)$, or $\Gamma(N)$, whichever you prefer) of some weight $\leq k$, and whose $q$-expansion (at infinity) is in $\mathbb{Z}[[q]]$. Let me call $M_k \subset \mathbb{F}_p[[q]]$ the image of $N_k$ by the map $f \mapsto \tilde f$: "reduction mod $p$ of the $q$-expansion of $f$". It is clear that $M_k \subset M_{k+1}$ and let $M = \cup_{k \geq 0} M_k \subset \mathbb{F}_p[[q]]$. It is clear that $M$ is a sub-algebra of $\mathbb{F}_p[[q]]$, that one can call the algebra of mod $p$ modular forms of level $\Gamma_0(N)$ (or $\Gamma_1(N)$, or $\Gamma(N)$). When $N=1$, the structure of $M$ has been determined by Swinnerton-Dyer in his famous paper in Antwerpen III (and there is an also famous Bourbaki seminar by Serre on this subject): when $p=2,3$, $M=\mathbb{F}_p[\tilde \Delta]$ and when $p\geq5$, $M=\mathbb{F}_p[\tilde E_4,\tilde E_6]/(A_p(\tilde E_4,\tilde E_6)-1)$, where $A_p$ is a polynomial in two variables, square-free, and homogeneous of degree $p-1$ if we consider $\tilde E_4$ of degree $4$ and $\tilde E_6$ of degree $6$. In particular, $M$ is in any case a noetherian domain of dimension $1$. My question is: 

The question is interesting, but presupposes that we understand and accept Amir's conclusion, namely that "we owe Definition by abstraction (taking equivalence classes as new objects) to the the abstract method in mathematics, that a mathematical object is what it does.” I do not fully understand it, and as I understand it now, I am not convinced. "Taking equivalence classes as new objects" seems essentially as old as human thought or at least human use of language. A word never denotes a "primitive" object, always an equivalence class, and a baby between one and two spends a lot of his time actively learning how to manipulate equivalence classes. By the way, Grothendieck says something similar somewhere in Recoltes et Semailles (this is not intended as an argument by authority, however it may seem :-) about the word "maman" (French version of the cross-language word "ma" or "mama"), in general one of the first word that a baby utters, at first used for what it does (calling Maman for cuddling, fooding, etc.) but which soon becomes a name for the class of all persons that are in the same relation to another baby (then another person or even animal) as the baby's own mother is to itself. (Grothendieck's point by the way is that the "method of abstraction" is universal and that he just pushed it maybe a little further than others) That seems different, and in a complicated relationship, with the idea that "a mathematical object is what it does", for which I think the proper name is functionalism. 

Of course, having a global, canonical, object is much more satisfying on esthetic grounds. As a mathematician formed after Grothendieck's revolution, this reason alone would be for me a sufficient one to consent the effort of constructing global eigenvarieties. But my question is meant to be understood a little bit more specifically: 

Please allow me to replace $\mathbb Z$ by $\mathbb Z_\ell$ in your question, as the problem of being saturated or not is local. Assuming $f$ is a cusp form, the answer is yes if and only if your modular form f is not Eisentein mod $\ell$ (that is, if the Galois representation $\rho_f$ is still irreducible modulo $\ell$). This is (in the difficult sense) the famous Ihara's Lemma. Indeed, this lemma states that the map $H^1(X_0(N),\mathbb Z/\ell) \times H^1(X_0(N),\mathbb Z/\ell) \rightarrow H^1(X_0(Nq),\mathbb Z/\ell)$ is injective, cf Ribet's article at the ICM 1982/1983, page 10. Under the hypotheses $f$ not Eisenstein, one has $H^1(X_0(N),\mathbb Z/\ell)[f] = H^1_c(Y_0(N),\mathbb Z/\ell)[f]$ and the same result with $N$ replaced by $Nq$, and this implies what you want. If $f$ is Eisenstein, this is always true. 

This is not an answer to the original question, since I do not yet know much about Matt's completed cohomology (but learning it seriously is high on my to-do list), but to the question as it has evolved after David's comment and Kevin's answer. It is true that Eichler-Shimura provides no natural bijective map from $S_{k+2}(\Gamma,Q_p)^2$ to $H^1_p(\Gamma,V_k(Q_p))$, as it does over $C$: we need to choose a normaliwation of the period of each eigenform appearing in the source to get one. Above, $V_k(Q_p)$ is the symmetric $k$-th power of $Q_p^2$, and $H^1_p$ is the parabolic cohomology, image of $H^1_c$ into $H^1$. However: 1) the fact that every system of Hecke eigenvalues appearing in $S_{k+2}(\Gamma,Q_p)$ also appears in $H^1_p(\Gamma,V_k(Q_p))$ (with twice the multiplicty), and conversely, extends to the infinite-dimensional generalizations, as follows: every system of Hecke eigenvalues with finite slope appearing in $S_{k+2}^{dag}(\Gamma,Q_p)$ also appears in $H^1_p(\Gamma,D_k(Q_p))$ (with twice the multiplicty), and conversely. Here $D_k$ is the space of distributions over $Z_p$ with a suitable action of $\Gamma$, that we assume contained in $\Gamma_0(p)$, depending on $k$. This also makes sense for negative $k$, or even $p$-adic $k$, and is also true. A proof can be found in my prepint on critical $p$-adic $L$-function. It uses idea of Stevens and Chenevier. The result is actually more precise (see below), and actually there is a small exception for $k=0$. 2) Somehow (I don't know exactly how), Iovita, Andreatta, and Stevens have constructed a Hecke-equivariant map $S_{k+2}^{dag}(\Gamma,Q_p)^2 \rightarrow H^1_p(\Gamma,D_k(Q_p))$ (or just the finite-slope part of them, I am not sure) for all $k$ (integer or not) which agrees with some normalisation of the classical Eichler-Shimura isomorphism when $k$ is a positive integer and we restrict to the sub-space of classical forms. 3) The precise form of my result 1) implies that the map 2) (on finite slope parts) is an isomorphism if it is injective, or if it is surjective. It is not known for which values of $k$ this holds. 

Dear mtb, I don't think that anything (at least that anything major) has been proved about this conjecture since Taylor wrote this paper about ten years ago. So what is known is essentially what Taylor says, that is the case of the whole $H^i$, and the components of $H^0$ and $H^1$. Note also that one cannot separates the part 3 of the conjecture from the rest, especially from part 1. 

I think that you may like the notes by Ioan Badulescu: see $URL$ They are a 20 pages modern essentially complete exposition of the proof of Jacquet-Langlands not only for $Gl_2$ but for higher higher rank linear groups and their inner form as well. 

(1) What are the technical advantages of working over a DVR? They are many. DVR are very simple rings, they are both local and principal. The principality in particular means that the flatness (which is a fundament and not sue say to grasp property in algebraic geometry) of a module or algebra over that sort of ring becomes something much simpler to understand, to check and to use, namely the propriety of being torsion-free. Also, a DVR is integrally closed, and that's a property that is very useful for certain type of reasoning in algebraic geometry. (2) The interest of working with a DVR in algebraic geometry does not come primarily from number theory. For example, you may have seen the valuative criterion of properness: to check if a morphism $f: X \rightarrow Y$ is proper, under certain mild hypothesis, you only have to check that the pull-back of this morphism over any spectrum of DVR $Y'$ is. This reduces the verification of an important relative property over an arbitrary base to the case of much simpler base, see (1), and is a crucial tool in algebraic geometry.
