Screens Screen brightness is a pretty rough thing in your eyes. Play with your screens, make sure that they only case as much light as they need to in order to be visible, and no more. A lot of folks prefer warmer colors as well. If your eyes are hurting, it may be worth it to consider trying some filtered glasses - The jury is still out on the long term benefits, but in the short term after eight hours in front of three monitors, my eyes don't hurt as much when wearing my pair. 

So, I'm considering going out job hunting again, and I've read it's always good to have a portfolio of your work handy. Unfortunately, the results of my work are rather boring to most people (An JavaScript/html calendar similar to JQuery's day-picker, an active html analog clock, etc). Alternatively, I have side projects that are more interesting (an Arduino sketch for a player-guitar, an Arduino sketch for an led grid that simulates light patterns similar to what you'd find on the bottom of a pool under moving water), but less useful in the real world. I'm trying to not be too broad or make a question which only has subjective answers, but I'm also trying to understand what sort of code and projects a recruiter might be interested in. I feel like my utilitarian code is more useful in the real world, but my side projects show more of an aptitude and ability to problem solve. Which would a recruiter be more interested in? 

We recently started a new appraisal form at our work, I as an employee need to fill this for myself, 

Can I class academic or personal project experience as relevant experience ? What does comes under relevant experience in this context, 

Sort of reply you received.. If it really has a smiley face in it then take it as a joke otherwise take it as a criticism. Either way You shouldn't take it too serious. For future... Don't forward CVs unless you are recommending someone you know... For strangers ask them to send CVs to company's generic recruitment address. By the way Recommending a stranger and than they become a pain for yourself... ? 

Reference Page 5 of 14 I have been at this company for 4 years and 6 months but I have experience of coding in university including final year project all coded by myself. Can I class academic experience as relevant experience ? Also what does means in above context ? Is it related to duration or just proving it regardless of time. 

Catess, since you've only put your applications in, I'd recommend not actively persuing one at the detriment of persuit of another. At this early stage, it's great to consider which jobs you'd prefer, but since you haven't been contacted for any of them, it'd be in your favor to make sure and be attentive and respond to all possibilities with equal enthusiasm. The ball will be in your court once you have job offers to compare, but until then, make sure and keep up with any communication and diplomacy with all three possible employers. One thing to keep in mind is in this situation, even an interview does not constitute an offer. Just because you've had an interview with your dream employer, don't skip out on contact with the others until you have the job secured. 

I'm being sent by my employer to a conference in another state. Having barely traveled of my own accord, I know nothing about how travel works, especially when (partially?) paid for by someone else. What questions should I ask my manager before I go? At this point, I don't know what I don't know. Things that may seem common place that I've never had to manage before 

Last but not least, don't be late in contacting a lawyer. Whatever the outcome, it is highly possible you will be needing one. And tell them to give you your book back. That's just ridiculous. 

Keeping people in the dark about things that concern them will lead to them making assumptions. And they will make the easiest assumption (that you're an a-hole). Now, this will go either way: 

They will accept and focus on what you're offering in the time you are actually there and they will review you based on your work They will choose not to continue with you. This is unlikely, they've trained you for years so they could use you, but if it happens, really no great loss, you will quickly find something else, especially in this wonderful field of work. 

This situation is a mess from start to finish. I, like the others, believe this is 110% a scam. AirBNB highly recommends not to send any payments or credit card information outside of their platform because of scams. All problems should be raised and taken care of through AirBnB. Plus, why would there be a need to send the credit card information? Your boss knows the address, she could just have the book delivered there from an online store. The biggest problem, though, lies in the way the company handled this situation. I think, at the best, that you are a collateral victim here and at the worst a scapegoat for something else. In either way, you have already been labeled as a thief and a liar. You will probably not be trusted again very soon, if ever. Advice: be very prepared for the next meeting and stick to the facts: 

I would suggest leaving these off without further study. It's great that you got some hands-on time with Java, Python, Ruby, and Selenium, but if I were interviewing you and you said you gained valuable in-depth experience with all of these technologies in only a week (you mentioned you were fired from the last position after only a week), I'd be very VERY skeptical, to the point that it would almost hurt your chances. Honestly, I feel like you should leave the position off your resume, and only post it in your work history. If the interviewer asks about it say something like "I was let go due to XYZ, but XYZ has been fixed". Assuming XYZ is innocuous, something like say, lack of reliable transportation, then it shouldn't hurt you too much. It might help get more quality answers about how to approach the situation if you were to post why you were let go as well. 

So, I am the SME in one area, and a backup SME in an area that overlaps. I cover my coworker's (Let's call him John) area while he's on PTO, and he does mine. A few weeks ago, he came by to let me know that he would be leaving the company as a heads up, but asked me not to discuss it with anyone. I kept silent, assuming he would give a customary two weeks notice, at which point we could start planning a shift of responsibilities. His final day is a little over a week away, and we're getting to the point where I really should start talking to my manager to let him know my attention is going to be divided. While the two areas overlap, there is generally enough work to do in both that it will affect my performance trying to cover both areas, I would like to Inform my boss in advance so he can plan. The thing Is, I want to respect my coworkers wishes (he didn't need to tell me). I've asked him about it and he said "He'll let them know" but isn't telling me when. How can I approach this situation? Edit: As per Alroc's comment, dual coverage is a company standard to improve bus factor. Every person has a dedicated backup (most of the time it's a paired backup in two related areas, but sometimes not). Additionally, to my knowledge. I'm the only person he has told. I know explicitly that he has not told our team lead. 

I followed above and now working in same company after 5 years and I can claim I know more then anyone here. 

It happened to me few times, when managers leave they don't communicate level of efforts made by different employees. Ideally managers should be communicating progress made by staff under them to higher management or to manager who will be taking over, but unfortunately this didn't happened to me. So if you have any staff who you see has the potential to move forward than do recommend them to your boss. 

Solution If my assumptions are right then stop asking questions unless you must have to (full stop - right now) 

Never ever shout about issues that came up because of something you did which had a negative impact on system. You may want to act nice to let everyone know but then you going to degrade your performance. It's a workplace - get over it. They helped you, you help them when they are in trouble that's how you balance such matters... Not by buying people gifts..
