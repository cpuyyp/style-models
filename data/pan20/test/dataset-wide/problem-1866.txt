I'm sure an explanation is given to the people fired. And each company has a rumour mill that usually knows what's going on. Rather than being worried, you need to find out the rumour mill. 

You are underestimating your time in the Air Force. You probably learnt a lot of skills that are directly relevant to engineering: Solving technical problems caused by everything from bad hardware to bad configuration. You learned how to work under extreme pressure and still deliver good results (I assume you did, or else the planes would have fallen!) You learned how to deal with politics, and still do your job (this is based purely on reading books my ex-servicemen, but it seems the armed forces are not immune to politics). Now you don't experience writing software, but that shouldn't matter. The biggest problem with CVs is the "Meh" effect. The recruiter looks at your CV and goes "Meh." Most CVs look alike, and there is nothing to separate them. Now if a recruiter sees your CV, with your 13 years experience, and next to it is some pimply kid who worked at McD, who do you think will be called in for an interview? You still need to have good technical knowledge to get the job, so make sure you are strong there too. As to what to write: Write about technical challenges you solved. Something that showed how, when faced with external pressures, like broken equipment, politics and time pressures, new technology, you still managed to complete a project on time. Give examples, so the interviewer has something to talk about. If you want more specific advice, feel free to contact me privately. 

In email correspondence I was asked a few questions that I am to answer before my interview. One of those questions was: "What are your salary requirements?" How can I approach this question when I haven't even been interviewed yet? I know what similar jobs pay in the area... but I don't even know all of the position responsibilities yet ...24hr on-call, weekends, time off, travel, ect. I don't want to just say an amount and have them hold that over me if I think it is too little for the work I want... but I also don't want to go too high and cut my chances of even getting interviewed. What is the best way to respond this? 

The problem is that these genius types have poor social skills. People are hired for how much they add to the bottom line, not how "smart" they are. Now answering your direct question: How do you cope with it? First thing is, stop worrying about it too much. I have worked in a place I absolutely hated for a long time. It is possible if you are willing to use it as an excuse to build your skills and become a much better programmer. You need to be sure you are strong, so that you are confident you will find another job easily. Some time ago I wrote about this: 

What do I do in this position? I am a student and I have bills that need to be paid, and they refuse to cut me a check outside of a payroll date (I have to wait 2 weeks til the next pay period). I don't want to sound demanding, but I read the receipt from the fax machine that said it had been sent. New York State 

This is inappropriate. If a recruiter has to force you into anything, I'd be hesitant. Especially when he isn't willing to give you some sort of accommodation for your efforts. Think about the situation he is putting you in. You have to take a hit from your paycheck for the days off. You have to pay for travel / hotel. For an interview that might not lead to a job. You should at the very least be able to demand that he asks the company on your behalf if they are flexible with a few days time off for a well qualified and interested candidate. If he still refuses tell him your intention to go above him and explain the volatile situation he has put you in. If he still refuses, follow through and go above him. You have nothing to lose at that point. 

I can sympathise with your situation. A lot of advice on resumes is written for experienced programmers looking for a better job. In that case, you really need to target your resume, as senior engineers earn a lot, and companies are very picky about who they hire. So while targeting your resume maybe good advice in the general case, it may not work in your specific case. The reason being that for new graduates / people with little experience, companies know that they will have no experience, and will have to be trained/mentored anyway. So they just look at rough details on your resume. It has been a long time since my first job, but I remember the fact that since I was going to be paid a lot less than experienced programmers, my resume didn't matter that much. The interviewer looked at it, but spent most of the time talking about what subjects I took, and asking me questions on those. So in your case, just sending a generic resume maybe good enough. My advice is: For jobs you really want, like the Googles/Facebooks of the world, make sure you target your resume. For all other jobs, just send a bland resume. The sad truth of the matter is, it is a probability game. Even excellent programmers get rejected for minor things, and all you can do is keep applying. 

I work as a programmer on a team that supports a group of enterprise applications. The team is so short-staffed and back logged that we currently suffer from an issue where we don't have time to create an error tracking / alerting system. All of our time is spent on supporting/fixing existing functionality, or building new functionality. We all work at the minimum 40 hour weeks, and we are all exempt / salaried. As a team we have discussed the dire need to get such a program in place because it will significantly reduce the time spent on break/fix and maintenance. I would like to offer my manager additional time to create a solution for the team, but I feel like it would only benefit myself if I were to receive a bonus for this additional time spent. The company regularly hires contractors to complete work that they are understaffed themselves to complete, so I feel like it isn't odd for them to shell out more to get what is needed. Is it ethical to propose to my boss that I offer a project plan to create this new program in exchange for a pay bonus? Or would that be seen as a slap in the face and unprofessional? This is not a request for a raise as I feel I am compensated for the average work week. I am requesting a one-time bonus for a one-time time-set project which would be solely worked on outside of usual duties. 

My second advice is to keep a low profile. Do your work well and go home. Keep building your skills in the background, and keep your resume up to date. That way, even if you are fired, you can be confident you will find another job soon. And the third is, don't think about it so much. You say you enjoy the work. So why not enjoy the time as well? Nothing lasts forever. Start saving money regularly, so that even if you are fired, you won't struggle financially. Edited to add: After reading JeffO's answer and his point about the 15% figure not being accurate, another point came to mind. Your company might have a macho attitude (let me guess: Its a video games company?) In these macho companies, you are expected to just get on with it, with none of this sissy 2-way communication. So the company is taking decisions, but doesn't feel it necessary to communicate why to the engineers. Which makes me think people like you are assuming the worst and having panic attacks. If so, the best thing is to quietly keep working. It's a problem of communication, not random firings. 

I have been working as a programming intern for a little over 6 months with a company. The hiring company sends me out to work for another company which in turn pays them. The "manager" at my office signs off on my timesheets and then I email or fax them in to a secretary at my hiring company to get paid. (1 timesheet ever 2 weeks) I did not sign any contract with my employer about the exact pay periods, at least to my knowledge. 

For the second time during my employment I was not paid on time. I have contacted the secretary multiple occasions and she never replies nor will she answer her office phone. My hiring manager tells me they never received the timesheet I submitted 2 weeks ago.
