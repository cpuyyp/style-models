If you feel the bike has no significant resale value, then why not just do what would produce the results YOU would like the most? But if you really want to preserve the stickers, but want to avoid the trouble and less than ideal paint job due to masking them, I'm guessing it would be possible to photograph (and PhotoShop) them (or find matching images on the web) and then reproduce them somehow with a reasonably waterproof printing scheme. 

Yep, "raw" aluminum develops a layer of corrosion fairly rapidly. Thankfully, unlike with iron/steel, the corrosion is "tight" and eventually develops to a thickness where additional corrosion is prevented (in normal circumstances). The corrosion can be prevented by either coating the aluminum with a lacquer-like coating or "anodizing" it. Anodizing is a process where the aluminum is dipped in an electrolyte solution and a current is run through it, to develop a layer of "super corrosion" that is smooth and fairly hard/scratch resistant. I'm guessing the bike was lacquered and the coating is breaking down. Once one little spot of breakdown appears, the corrosion below will push up the adjacent areas, creating a growing spot that turns into the "worms" you see. There is no structural problem as a result of this -- it's purely cosmetic. The thing to be concerned about would be if there were any spots (particularly around the joints) where a salt-like crust was forming. This would indicate that the aluminum is "crystalizing" in the weld, and fractures, if not already present, are imminent. 

(It is curious that the decal says "8 speed" -- not something you'd expect as original equipment on a 27 speed bike.) (It appears to be a down-pull style derailer, and it should center over the granny gear when the cable is fully released.) 

One thing is that the spokes need to be different to facilitate the machines doing the lacing (or at least this was once the case, according to Peter White). But certainly a machine can produce a decent wheel more cheaply than one can hire one hand-built. It's more a question of going beyond "decent" to "better" quality. (BTW, I recommend building (or rebuilding) your own wheels a few times, if you're reasonably mechanically inclined. There are good step-by-step instructions available from several sources (including Sheldon Brown as mentioned in another reply), and it's a not-too-unpleasant way to occupy a few winter evenings with bike-related stuff when you can't be on the road due to the weather & darkness. You may not even do as well as a machine, but you do get a sense of accomplishment, and it makes wheels less intimidating.) 

14 MPH is a fairly good pace for that ride -- I wish I could do that well anymore. Take along some snacks -- sports bars, fruit bars, plain old candy, nuts -- whatever you'll find appealing. Have a break about once an hour with a snack and extra water. And keep practicing -- the body builds up endurance fairly slowly. Seven hours in the saddle isn't that long, once you get your butt conditioned. How much difference a "racing bike" would make depends on your "touring bike". If your current bike has drop bars then the main difference is weight (which has very little effect on speed) and tire width/tread. Keeping tires inflated to the max sidewall pressure will minimize tire drag. 

My preference is for SPD clipless pedals and "walkable" clipless shoes. But I still have a pair of lightweight "tennis shoes" in my gear for campsite, days off, etc. Another option, if you can still find them, is the old-fashioned "touring" shoes and regular toe straps. "Touring" shoes are (or were) quite walkable, and it's reasonable to walk miles in them (whereas you'd not like to do that in even "walkable" clipless shoes). It is a little tricky setting up clipless shoes -- the cleat position needs to be positioned correctly. Partly this is trial and error (be sure to get your setup early to try it out), but a shop can help you get the right "initial conditions". (For those who've never seen them, touring shoes look superficially like bowling shoes, with relatively flat, smooth soles, to more easily slip into and out of toe clips. Unlike bowling shoes, however, the soles are reasonably stiff -- flexible enough for easy walking but stiff enough so that the pressure of the pedal is reasonably well distributed over the bottom of the foot.) 

Looks to me like the difference is as much in the stem as in the bar. (It may be that for the Dr. Dew the bar has simply been rotated to a flatter position.) And both bikes appear to use a threadless headset, so the stem can be replaced without touching the headset proper. In some cases the stem is designed to allow it to be removed from the bar without having to "strip" the bar, in other cases not. Can't tell from the pictures. Minor differences in bar position -- height and "reach" -- can have a major effect on riding comfort. Lowering the bar and/or moving it forward will significantly increase the pressure on the hands and add strain to the back. It does improve aerodynamics significantly, but, unlike with a "drop" bar, you tend to be stuck with that lower position, even when you'd like to relax a bit. (But there are various add-ons for straight bars that allow one to switch back and forth between a relatively upright position and a more aero one.) (In fact, it's a pet peeve of mine that many bikes are designed to look "mean" on the showroom floor, with bar positioned low, but the bars are positioned too low for the comfort of most riders, and the threadless scheme makes it harder to raise the bar very much. As a result, many bikes are purchased, ridden for a few weeks, found to be uncomfortable, and then forgotten.) 

The amount of chain that the rear derailer arm can "absorb" between the most extended chain position and the most "relaxed" is generally specified as a number of teeth, being the difference between the sum of the teeth on the largest front and rear sprockets and the sum of the teeth on the smallest front and rear sprockets. A sprocket cluster has a number of sprockets joined together with a certain "pitch" -- the distance between sprockets, as measured from (to pick one point) the outermost surface of one sprocket to the outermost surface of the next sprocket. The "pitch" of the derailer/shift lever must match this sprocket cluster pitch or the derailer will never be able to be adjusted to shift between sprockets. The total distance the derailer must be able to move is the index pitch times one less than the number of sprockets in the cluster. Eg, for 5 sprocket cluster with a 5mm pitch the derailer must move 20mm from innermost to outermost. Note that most derailers can be adjusted with the high and low limits to 2 or 3 different numbers of sprockets. The angle is a little more complicated, and also not always well documented for different derailers. The rear cluster on a mountain or touring bike generally has a wide range of sprocket sizes and hence the angle that the derailer movement must describe relative to the axle is fairly steep. A racing cluster, on the other hand, would tend to have sprocket sizes very close together (only one tooth difference in the extreme case), and so the angle relative to the axle is fairly shallow. Derailer specifications may state this quantity as a range of sprocket sizes, or a range of teeth (or may omit it entirely). (Obviously, "angle" is also an issue for front derailers, and here the acceptable sprocket sizes should be clearly spelled out. Your standard front derailer may not handle that super-small granny gear, for instance.) Most 9-speed derailers can be adjusted to work with an 8-speed cluster, so long as the 8-speed cluster is using the 9-speed pitch. Unfortunately, the pitch of 8-speed clusters is not cast in concrete, but in most cases it's the same as 9-speed. 

Yeah, the narrower tires weigh less and have very slightly less rolling resistance. They also create less air drag. But you're right that there is a tendency to put the narrower tires on "road" bikes, even if they're clearly not "competition" class. I suspect that this is because, like several other aspects of a bike, the narrow tires are simply perceived (by most) as "better" and perhaps "sexier", and so they look better on the show room floor. (And note that a cheap bike is apt to have 23mm tires rated at 85psi -- lower than optimal for many situations, while a better bike might have 27mm tires rated at 105psi. I run my 35mm tires at 100psi.) 

The first case may simply indicate that the derailers are not properly adjusted (or may be due to worn components). The second case indicates that either the rear derailer does not have enough tension for the selected gear combo (maybe the chain is simply too long) or the chain/sprockets are badly worn. A chain is good for roughly 1000-2000 miles, and a rear cluster for 5000-10000 miles. And running a worn chain for too long will cause the rear cluster to wear out faster. 

Unfortunately my crummy draw tool won't let me place the lines very accurately, but this is the idea: 

You can't bend over and tie your shoes with 100% safety -- you might throw your back out, you might lose your balance, etc. As to "tricks", one man's "trick" is another man's "ho-umm" -- it depends on your level of skill and physical conditioning. Certainly, hopping a moderate height curb is within the realm of possible (I used to do it on occasion, before I became old and crotchety), but doing so at relatively high speed is non-trivial. But "tricks during commuting" is concerning -- while you're welcome to be as daring (or foolish) as you want to be when you're safely by yourself and not a hazard to others, when any bicycle, pedestrian, or vehicle traffic is nearby (or potentially nearby but unseen) it's incumbent on you to behave in a manner that does not put others at risk (or serious inconvenience). 

Yep, there are various types of spokes, as already explained. There are also various ways of "lacing" the spokes, and various spoke counts. When picking a spoke lacing scheme, there are six basic considerations: 

The chief advantage of the wireless is that it doesn't have wires that you have to route, and which can get snagged. In fact, that's probably the only advantage. When my old wired Cateye gave up the ghost (the cadence sensor basically fell apart), I bought a new Cateye Strada wireless unit, and it's been a bit of a PITA. First unit didn't work at all, so I returned that and got a second. It works, but setting it up the radio is non-trivial, and they saved 50 cents by putting the wheel and cadence sensors in one unit, so it's really tricky to get the pickup adjusted right. And on that unit the stupid one-button design causes the it to switch displays when you hit a bump, reset if you rest your hand on it for an instant. (I don't understand why so few units have cadence anymore -- I use my cadence more than my MPH.) Added: Finally solved the one-button-hit-a-bump problem by placing a tiny blob of silicone caulk between the unit and the bracket. Will make it hard to change the battery when the time comes, but I'll probably replace the entire unit then anyway -- the Strada sucks. 

Generally the QR lever on the rear tire is on the left, so as to not interfere with the derailer. It makes (a little) sense to put the QR lever of the front tire on the same side (at least if you have any OCD tendencies). But it basically doesn't matter, so long as the tire has no preferred rotation direction (and you don't have something like disk brakes that demands a certain orientation). (And if the tire direction is wrong you can always remove the skewer and insert it from the other side -- the axle itself is perfectly symmetrical.) 

Normally you replace a cable when it becomes too badly rusted, or the cable inside begins to break. The first condition you notice because the cable does not move freely, and the second you notice because the brake levers "give" (and don't bounce back) when you squeeze them hard. If not rusty, a set of cables can easily last 10-20 years. In your case it seems likely that the brake pads are simply wearing rapidly. With V brakes, for 1mm of pad wear you'll need to take up about 3mm of cable slack. If you're having to adjust the cable too often you may wish to change out your pads for something harder (though note that this will reduce braking power). 

These days the dropouts are still a tell, but not nearly as reliable as before. And frames are often made of materials other than steel, and even steel can now be welded, using a rapid-weld process originally developed for aluminum frames. (Though a good-quality lugged steel frame is still a thing of beauty.) Other than the frame, the most obvious identifier of low quality is a one-piece crank. This was true 20 years ago and is still true. Well, I'll take that back -- one more thing: Twist shifters are highly suspect. They are cheap and have an extraordinarily high failure rate. There presumably are some good quality twist shifters, but they're the exception. Make that two more things: With a multi-speed bottom bracket, check the material used to make the chainrings. Very often BSOs have steel rather than aluminum chainrings. A better quality bike may have a steel "granny" ring, but the others would be aluminum. 

This is just like an automobile brake and would be fixed using the same techniques. First make sure the lever is moving freely, and is not "bottoming out" due to the cable being too tight. (To adjust the brake you do not tighten the cable but rather adjust the eccentric that is opposite the lever pivot. Then adjust the cable to match.) Lubricate the pivot lightly, but do not get any lubricant on the drum or shoes. If need be, wash off any oil or grease on the drum/shoes and wipe with a naptha-moistened cloth, then sand the shoes lightly to remove any glaze. Examine the shoes to make sure they are not worn out, and examine the drum for serious scoring. 

In theory, since the sprockets are so wide, and the belt lacks holes, snow/mud that gets between sprocket and belt will be packed into the notches and could build up if conditions are right. This could build up to where it locks the belt (or damages it, if the rider tries to force the thing), in the worst case. In any case, it's not going to make pedaling any easier. I was just reading where truck off-roaders have a lot of trouble with mud in their serpentine belts, in some cases damaging the belt or the bearings of the generator or idler. No experience with bicycle belt drive, though, in any conditions. Added: I do notice, in the belt tension thread, that the front sprocket has large holes in it and, one would expect, would not have much trouble with snow/mud buildup. The rear sprocket (in the image presented) is not seen well enough to say if it has holes in it, but it looks like not -- at least not as big as the front. Other bikes may be different, of course. 

Yep, a standard 700C tube will fit a 27" tire (and most tube boxes bear multiple markings to indicate this). Just convert the inch width to mm to get the width of the 700C tube, if the box doesn't say the inch size. Tires, of course, are a different matter -- there is enough difference in rim diameters between 27" and 700C tires (which don't stretch like tubes) that one will not fit the other. 

To directly address the question in the title: There is no reason for a rotor to be designed to shear off, and no point in having the individual bolts be able to shear off more readily than the materials used would normally allow. One might argue that something might get caught in the holes of the disk, causing the wheel to lock, but there's always the danger of something getting caught in the spokes or a bearing locking up, or some such, and no provision is made to "protect" from these situations. And it should be noted that the mode of failure of the bolts would not allow the disk to spin free, since even with the heads broken off the bolt bodies would still prevent the disk from rotating free. If anything, the disk would pop outward on one edge and make the brakes be more likely to seize. The bolt failure here is not "by design" (unless someone is purposely sabotaging their parts to increase replacement parts sales). 

For that distance on flat roads it doesn't matter. Just get whatever you like, is comfortable to ride, and will be capable of carrying whatever you might need to carry. (I suggest a rack and baskets or panniers rather than a backpack, but that's a personal thing.) For your budget and needs look for a nice used bike. Especially since you've not ridden much there's no sense spending money on a new bike you may decide you don't like in a year. You might want to budget some money for some good raingear -- it's not cheap.
