In a society facing large issues with scarcity then it can be seen as government bringing stability and revolution bringing chaos. People may be worried that a revolution could mean interruption to their already meagre supply of resources. If food is scarce then that means revolution could bring starvation. This would set people against revolution out of fear and make them praise the police for shutting it down. A dictatorship could carefully control its image with propaganda and restricted areas to ensure any wealth officials had is not seen, and therefor not a motivation to revolution. 

Not quite luck, but organization Instead of having a system were using magic creates a penalty in the form of random bad luck try a system that penalizes by randomly destroying organization similar to what was created in the future. Just about any use of magic could be seen as organizing something, for example light a flame and you have organized heat, build a structure and you have organized materials, stop time and you have organized time. The consequences can then follow with results that come back to what created them. The cost of a fire is that heat disperses sometime in the future, someone feels a chill or fire goes out. The cost of a structure is that other structures (or even the created structure sometime in the future) are liable to suddenly collapse. Stop time... well get ready for some paradoxes suddenly occurring in the area. This system makes it very easy for the effect to be traced back to the cause and can definitely turn people against magic based on a net neutral or net loss effect. A mage might stop a building full of people from collapsing, but would they really be hailed as a hero if the people know that another building will randomly collapse on them in the future? The same way many of the heat responses point to entropy, this too would be an entropy inducing event. Entropy is the tendency to move from organization to disorganization. The energy of an object moving in a certain direction is more organized than that object at rest with the energy converted to extra heat. Two objects at different temperatures is more organized than the same two objects with their temperatures averaged. 

Six gigalightyears is halfway to the edge of the universe (13.82 billion light years). That would create a very large obstacle for astronauts looking to find their way: they would be looking at a night sky about 6 billion years younger in the direction opposite their travel and 6 billion years older in the direction of travel. We map the sky on Earth the way we see it. Many of the brighter stars have lifetimes of only a few million years, so they would either be long gone or not yet born, or at different phases of their lives (red giants, novae, neutron stars). Even galaxies may look very different over such a large distance. For example, at 4.5 only billion years old, the sun would not even exist in the night sky of the other world, 6 billion light years away. With back-and-forth travel to Earth available, it might be possible that something in the method of travel provides a rough idea of direction and distance. With that extra clue, you could start drawing inferences about what is what and eventually come up with a guess as to overall location. However, you could quickly build a new star map and determine where you are in the new night sky (not connected to the bigger picture). 

If you want "fast" acting radiation sickness, forget about it being localised, or safe. Levels of radiation that are instant (i.e. onset within seconds to minutes from exposure) require extreme levels of radiation, and not just any type of radiation, but either fast neutrons, or gamma emissions (as they are most energetic ones). For prompt effect you will want 6-8 thousand rem of prompt, full body exposure equivalent, which is basically putting a person in front of a industrial- or weapon-grade criticality event. Like this one: $URL$ or $URL$ (warning: descriptions are graphic, and might be unpleasant to read.) Both incidents involved very large amounts of enriched fissiles, and a critical configuration of them, and its not really possible to direct that kind of high energy outputs on a single person, w/o affecting everything in general area. 

Yeah, its technically plausible. Of course, an exosuit will only support your body and limbs, leaving out the more serious problem: heart might be hard pressed to keep up with pumping needs. Unless you find a way to internally/externally supplement that (and other bodily internal functions, that might depend on gravity), you will run into problems. 

Per Hypertextbook nerve impulse speeds vary between 0.61 m/s (pain), 76 m/s (touch), and 191 m/s (muscle firing). It also, in the case of reflex, can fire multiple signals and register-but-ignore the late arriving ones. If you were to thread the nervous system with fibers doped with some material at the active sites that converted sodium and potassium surges to an electrical impulse, then had an additional diode-like material to convert that electrical impulse to light, passed the impulse down the fiber, then repeated that process in reverse to stimulate either muscles are excite a nerve cluster, the signal speed would be much closer to the speed of light (300,000,000 m/s). For a 2 meter tall person you would only be shaving 0.01 seconds ( $2 meters \over 200 m/s$) off reaction time. I have an old equation for aiming time. I don't remember the origin, but it was measured by asking subjects to click on a circle with a mouse. $ t = B + a \log({2\pi\over D})$ where D is target diameter in meters and B and a are experimentally determined values. B = 0.5 seconds and a = 0.45 seconds in the test subjects. There is an initial reaction time, but then your brain is engaged in a feedback loop moving towards the target, assessing progress, and moving again. You can shave the 'a' try-assess-correct loop (0.45 seconds) by training and building muscle memory. However, this is available to normal humans and super humans both. If I remember correctly the initial reaction time 'B' did vary between subjects. There are studies indicating that stimulants could drop initial reaction time by 100 milliseconds (20%). Some combination of stimulants and focus enhancers may be able to achieve greater effect. But overclocking reaction time results in the nervous stereotype of someone overstimulated. 

Look into the Roche Limit One of the ways that planets end up with rings is that another smaller (or with lower surface gravity) celestial body comes close enough to it that the planets gravity exceeds the other body's gravity at its surface ripping it apart. So, if you want to have tides significantly effect gravity then you have to look for a system where the planet is approaching the limit for how close it could reach the moon without being destroyed by it. Now in reality that Roche limit does not exist because the smaller body would be ripped apart first. As a result if you want want a planet with significant fluctuation in free-fall acceleration due to tidal forces of another celestial body then you would probably be looking at something a lot closer to a binary system or a system where your "planet" is actually the moon than an earth/luna system. Now if we say for example that the two bodies are of identical mass and radius, assuming perfectly ridged spheres, then with gravity diminishing by a power of two, the distance between the surfaces of the bodies for a 30% reduction in gravity due to tidal effects when compared to the same body in isolation gives ~83% planetary radius. If we compare between peak gravity and minimum gravity they will be allowed to be a little further apart since both gravities will add when on the opposite side of the planet, but the difference wouldn't be much. At this distance you end up the other body being very big in the sky, you will have very frequent eclipses. Also if the bodies have atmospheres than their outer bounds could be touching leading to orbital decay over extreme lengths of time, making such a configuration unlikely. In summary, you may want your "planet" to actually be the moon. 

The other world might not be real (a computer simulation) or it might have some unusual TBD biology that enables the quicker perceived time (such as mosquito or bacterial life times and evolutionary quickness). The portal might do the work of translating the biology of a traveler to be suited for the destination. Had another thought. What you might want is a white hole. A white hole might be negative mass, and cause time inflation (instead of dilation) close to the Schwarzchild radius. You've asked for a roughly 1:1,200 time inflation, so the planet would need to orbit very close to that edge (R-planet ~ 1.0008 R-schwarzchild) Moreover, the gradient between one edge of the planet and the other shouldn't be too large, or the gradient would cause all sort of odd effects. So, 6,000 kilometers should be about 0.001 Rs - at a minimum Rs = 6 million kilometers. That's a big white hole (about ten times the diameter of the sun), but not huge. The white hole could be inside-out, where the negative energy portion interacts with the rest of the universe, or outside-in, which would be very different. The planet would somehow have to fight the force of gravity pushing it further away - maybe the aliens that seeded the planet or built the gateway have something. 

Both RTGs, and ny kind of reactor is not realistic by far. RTGs, while light and not having many moving parts, are not radiologically safe to be around. Unless you understand "being around" as deploying it and having a no-go zone 200 meters wide around it, until it stops working by itself. While it is somewhat-useable on an unmanned space probe, or an automatic weather station in a polar area, its not feasible for any real use with people around. Reactors are a step above that. They need heavy shielding around them (the pressure vessel alone will NOT cut it enough), they need support infrastructure (turbines, steam dehumidifiers, 2 or 3 (VERY) high pressure coolant loops (of which first one is deadly to be around just like that, due to radiological hazard, and they need large amounts of water (all nuclear plants, sans literally ONE, in the worlds, have either a river, lake, or similar water source nearby). Furthermore, fuel. You cant just put a natural uranium ore or unenriched natural uranium into an RTG or reactor. Reactor grade fuel means 3-5% enrichment (you need an enrichment plant for that). This is the easy fuel. RTG's do not work on uranium - they use plutonium (highly purified, too! RTG plutonium fuel pellets relase realy obscene amounts of heat due to its high isotope purity and high activity), which is not found in nature unles you breed it (for which process, in turn, you need a specialised breeder reactor, and enrichment plant). All of which are high level of complexity, highly dangerous (radiation, chemicals used) heavy industries. 

EDIT (to account for new information): My understanding of the question is: given the forces listed above, plus 187 American reinforcement aircraft in Day 2, and assuming that leaving the ballistic missile sites alone for several days is an option, is it possible for any of the ballistic missile sites to survive a sustained air assault? Yes. Here is a simulation. Feel free to make a copy and experiment. In summary, the surface to air missiles would do terrific damage on the American aircraft. It would be reasonable for the Cuban surface to air missile sites to be the sole focus of the first day of combat. It would be a bloodbath, and almost all of the American aircraft would be shot down. All of the surface to air launchers, however, would be destroyed. Reinforcements, in the form of 187 additional American aircraft would arrive at the end of Day 1. This would give the Americans an almost 2-to-1 numerical advantage over the Cubans. I looked at several websites that said Cuban aircraft were superior air-to-air fighters than their American counterparts. To get to surviving nuclear missile sites, you must assume this to be true. The next requires a misstep in the American commander's assignment of aircraft missions - continuing to focus on surface to air missile site hunting in Day 2, completely understandable since they shot down nearly four hundred American planes the day before. However, this ground focus allows Cuban aircraft to continue shooting down American planes - cutting down the American numerical advantage. On Day 3, the American commander changes focus to the Cuban aircraft. The battle will continue for two days, where the superior Cuban air fighters and shorter sortie times allow the Cubans to turn the tide, shooting down the last American aircraft on Day 5. In this instance, all 40 ballistic missile sites would remain. If the American commander devotes some small percentage (less than 20%) of the force to taking out the ballistic missile sites first, the number could be reduced.
