Ending of fetters is included in the Fourth Noble Truth - the Eightfold Noble Path leading to cessation of suffering. Unsatisfied craving (tanha) and clinging/sustenance (upadana) are singled out because they are the immediate causes of dukkha, while everything else (illusion of self and the fetters) serves as the support/foundation but is not the direct cause. In other words, craving is singled out because suffering is singled out. And suffering is singled out because it's the most obvious difference between Samsara and Nirvana, it is what we all have in common, so it's a good point to start. However, cessation of suffering is just one aspect of The Goal. The other aspect is Bodhi - awakening. If we remember awakening we can see that cessation of craving is not enough, there has to be realization or insight. And achievement of that insight is what most of the Noble Path is about. 

Not an answer from texts, but from my own practice: what I noticed is that certain songs start playing in my head when my "subconscious" mind (which is pretty conscious these days, but usually sits in the background) wants to communicate some concern or sentiment to the rest of "me". So it starts playing some song with a certain message in its lyrics. I swear I'm not making this up, noticed many times. And most of the time the message is pretty obvious and is related to some suppressed concern that bothers me. In order to stop it playing, I just have to stop ignoring it and acknowledge receiving the message. Think about the issue. Then the song stops. 

when detachment comes from strength -- it comes from the idea of freedom, of independence, of being one's own island, of needlessness and emancipation, from wisdom, from compassion. when detachment comes from weakness -- it comes from fear of confrontation or involvement, from laziness, from doubts, from incomplete understanding, from "spiritual materialism", from attachment to private peace of mind. 

In Asia, the various forms of Buddhism have inspired uncountable number of art objects created over the centuries: statues, monuments, temples, icons etc. Some art forms, particularly Japanese ones, are considered no less than expressions of the Enlightened Mind. Many Zen Masters were known for their calligraphy, drawing, and/or poetic skills. The now famous music of shakuhachi flute was popularized by the Fuke sect of Buddhistm. Late Chogyuam Trungpa Rinpoche was known for his endless creativity. Check out his True Perception: The Path of Dharma Art, Timely Rain: Selected Poetry of Chogyam Trungpa, The Art of Calligraphy, and other writings. Teacher I.L. declared awakening of the enlightened creativity, as a tool for the universal benefit to oneself and others, to be the point of Enlightenment. From other teachers I heard that creativity is one of the hallmarks of Enlightenment, as the mind without defilements uncovers potential for unlimited uninhibited creation. So in short, most of the time Buddhism welcomes art and creativity, especially the kind that either expresses Enlightened Mind or popularizes Dharma. 

Watch the mind for emotions arising due to giving anything high importance. Let go of those. Watch the mind for signs of behavior targeted at defending or advocating one's ego. Drop that. Watch the mind for indulging. Stop that. Protect your mind from garbage and negative information. Learn some Buddhist theory. 

I like to compare Koans with poems, or with jokes. Poems teach us to experience the world directly, unmediated by discursive analytical thinking, as feelings and associations. Getting a joke requires expanding one's context, relating alternative frames of reference. In some professional settings, the experts develop a shortcut way of referring to things they deal with. E.g. in software engineering, you could hear someone saying that a particular design is kludgy, or leaking, or tangled up etc. Not all of these have official agreed-upon definitions, and many are made up ad-hoc, as required for communicating in a particular situation. The method of Zen is to get practitioner in touch with their immediate experiences (to point them to their own mind). This requires transcending whatever context the person is stuck in, and expanding one's awareness to include "the elephant in the room". To build on the joke metaphor, the point of Koans is to make you "laugh". Now, you can answer your own question: will explaining jokes help you learn how to laugh? Will analyzing songs help you learn how to feel? Why did many Buddhists publish koan commentaries for many hundred years? -- I don't know. Because they are slaves of their minds? Because they think it may be helpful to certain types of practitioners? The other problem with explaining Koans is that a Koan (unlike a joke) does not have a single "correct" interpretation. A Koan is always ambiguous, by design. A good koan commentary may help one explore various facets of the theme. Sort of like analyzing poems in school may(!) help one develop artistic sensitivity. But in context of Buddhism S.E. the danger is, someone might read an answer and assume they now know what this Koan is about. Many people don't see until they know what to look for. I may not see a frog under my feet until my wife points it out, even though I've been staring directly at it. What we want to learn in Zen is to "see" before knowing. The more you explain Zen, the further you are from "seeing". 

You are asking how to train in overcoming mind's tendency to stereotype and to reify superficial perceptions. Generally speaking, entire Buddhist path is about training in this. Much of the philosophical study (Madhyamaka) and practice of Zen and Vajrayana's higher tantras (Mahamudra and Dzogchen) are aimed at transcending the limits of superficial mind. Working with a live contemporary teacher adds a practical aspect that is not readily explained in texts. This aspect has to do with application of Buddhist insights to everyday life. The superficial mind with its tendency for stereotyping keeps creating reoccurring patterns in one's personal life. It is by exploring and challenging these patterns that we get to see our superficial mind objectively. This leads to gradual disidentification and eventual freedom from stereotypical thinking. In my personal experience undergoing this training, there are two parts to it. The first one is explained conceptually, for the student to practice on his own, between the periods s\he meets with the teacher. The second part is traditionally taught by the teacher in-person, without much explanation. The part that's explained conceptually is a standard instruction on non-attachment. In my "lineage" it goes something like this: 

And the way the positive qualities are generated in the first Jhana is with intentional vitakka and vicƒÅra, or deliberate thinking/generation/enjoyment, about how well you mastered the non-arising and abandonment of "evil, unskillful qualities": 

Briefly, "let go" here means you turn your attention to something else (like the room in front of you) - and then whatever thoughts you had the moment before dissolve by themselves. Normally our attention is dragged around by thoughts and experiences. Being able to disengage from them, and either hold on firmly to one thing, or to switch around at will, or to kinda suspend mid-air as thoughts and experiences flow by - is a useful skill to have. Specifically in this case you're learning to disengage from whatever particular thoughts you have at the moment - to disidentify and to stop feeding. It doesn't mean your mind goes blank, since you still have experiences of your body and surroundings, exhaling etc., - and you have an overall idea of what it is that you are doing (meditating, disengaging). So all mental functions keep on going, it's just that you are learning to gently let go of mental chatter, daydreaming, worrisome replays etc. (no reference for this: I'm summarizing broadly based on what I was taught by the live Zen Master, what I read in books, and on my own meditation experience) 

Learn to always be in a positive mood, and it will naturally subside. When you are bright and shining, your brain will continuously produce the same hormone that is released during orgasm. Do abdominal exercises. 

The truth about the nature of reality is, strictly speaking, cannot be spoken, because reality is so multifaceted that it can never be fully and precisely expressed in words and concepts. This is in line with the rest of Diamond Sutra which tries to give the reader a taste of the experience of Emptiness. 

From this you can see that according to Abhidharma of Vaibhasika school which is what Mahayana follows, sunlight can be pure color without shape. As Jayarava used to be fond of repeating (and as Thanissaro Bhikkhu is equally fond of hammering in), the perspective of Buddhism is that of phenomenology and not of metaphysics. From phenomenological standpoint there is absolutely no problem with having a perception of color without a perception of shape (nor taste, smell, nutriment, solidity, adhesion, and motion). 

It seems to me the central object of faith in Buddhism is The Goal: Enlightenment or Nirvana. In my own experience, would I be interested in Buddhism if I did not have faith in Enlightenment? Probably not... If there was no Goal, nothing in Buddhism would make sense, right? There would be no escape from suffering... So the Path would lead nowhere. There would be no knowing The Nature of The Mind... There would be no Directly Seeing it For Yourself... There would be no Ultimate Result of Wholesome Action... If we did not have Goal, all we would have is good behavior for the sake of better living - before you die. How fun would that be? 

Well in one sense impermanence is ultimately true. In the other sense though it's just a concept, an idea, used to make a point. The objective of the point is to preempt grasping for things as if they were permanent, and the purpose of non-grasping is prevention of suffering. But even prevention of suffering is merely one of many motives that leads a person to enlightenment, other motive for example being perfection or conceit. In this sense everything is just a skillful mean inasmuch as it pushes some people in the right direction. 

The only time I've seen the heart-beat mentioned in a similar context, is when Trungpa Rinpoche discussed beginner-level practice: 

Negative scattering -- remembering a disagreeable object; Coarse excitement -- remembering a pleasant object; Subtle excitement -- having a part of the mind come under the influence of discursive thinking (vikalpa), and as a result, having an (agreeable) object about to appear to the mind, "like water moving under ice". This is caused by the mind being a little too tight. 

According to Triyana framework as presented by Chogyam Trungpa Rinpoche, the first stage of Buddhist training, known as "Hinayana", involves special emphasis on discipline and simplicity, in essence very similar to what you call "austerity" above. The idea is to reduce the coarse defilements by restricting activities that lead to experiences that sustain the defilements. Metaphorically, in order to sober up you have to stop drinking. Basically, this means saying "no" to indulging, in all its shapes and forms. 

Because subjectively some experiences are still better than others. Being healthy is better than being sick, being at peace is better than being troubled etc. Plus, of course, there is the fun of creation, art; playing and dancing with the world. 

Anger or hatred is one of the two main blinding affects ("avarana-klesha" - the other one being lust aka strong obsessive desire). When the mind is affected by anger it can't understand things properly, it confuses what's a wrong action and what's a proper action in this situation. So that's what we mean by saying that you are punished by your own anger or your own weakness for pleasure - that we go temporarily insane and do stupid things, and then suffer the consequences.
