While @Batman makes some good points, round here we have some descents on narrow country lanes with high hedges and poor road surfaces. Modulating speed is much more important than on the open road. You might get up to 50 or even 60km/h on a clear stretch but then have to brake for a blind bend. You don't want to rely on braking too hard because of loose gravel or patches of mud on the road. We do also have open road fast descents but they tend to be on busier roads and I won't go into them. I'm lucky enough to have discs on a tourer and can use continuous light braking at the back to control my top speed, then slow down with the front brake before a bend. I prefer to do anything tricky on the hoods (these descents, traffic) and can crouch quite low if I do get a nice straight. So I like to have 2 fingers on the brakes as the index finger is very near the pivot - with index and middle fingers I've got all the stopping power I want (subject to road surface). In the drops, one finger is enough because it's got more leverage, but only if I've checked the brifters - when badly adjusted the tab you press when shifting to a bigger cog limits braking when it hits my fingers. I apply similar methods to other cases when sudden braking might be required, like in traffic (1 to 3 fingers depending on road surface, speed etc.) 

I've had a couple of basic heart monitors that don't integrate with anything. They suited me and are cheap to try. One of them came with a handlebar mount for the wristwatch display which was solid enough when I tried it briefly. I bought them for running, and found that I didn't like the zone notifications and alarms (on the treadmill analogue models are prone to false spikes in HR from interference from other units). A major advantage of these basic units is that they don't rely on battery-sucking Bluetooth running on a phone. I also find it much easier to read a wristwatch riding than a phone screen in bright sunlight. But if you've (unlike me) got round to solving the latter, that won't be an issue for you. 

You need a local test route for this and other things. For some things just up and down your street will do, but for this issue you might need to put the bike through its paces properly. Ride your test route, paying particular attention to the feel of the problem. Stop the bike, tweak something relevant (your best guess) and ride it again. Better or worse? If better but not perfect - adjust some more the same way, if worse go the other way. You may be able to use your commute in the same way if commuting on this bike is an option. In your case I'd get it perfect on the stand, then tighten the rear derailleur cable a little. Test ride and see. Actually of course this is a tedious version of normal adjustment procedure. The nice thing about a rear derailleur adjustment issue is you don't need the bike on the stand for minor tweaks. 

I actually run two tyres identical except for the width, and when I first fitted them it made no difference at all to the difficulty. My situation is a little different: they're marathon plus 28 and 32 mm (700c). There's much more variation between brands, types, and maybe even batches, with anti puncture tyres generally harder to get on/off than cheap multi purpose tyres and some coming up big, some small (which makes a big difference) To be honest though, if the time to take a tyre off and change the tube is significant, something else is wrong. I've just had my first puncture in over 3000 miles on fairly rubbish tarmac, for example. 

The hardest to fit tyres I've ever dealt with were continental comfort contact (and I run marathon plus which are reputed to be difficult). Like yours they needed serious overpressure to seat, even after wetting the rim. After several years fitted they're still going strong. I had to change a tube in one recently and it was much easier but still hard to seat. I seem to recall some strings but removed them before mounting the tyre. 

A further effect is likely to be that exerting yourself hard on an uncomfortable bike means you get to the top, get off, and have a good tall stretch. That could make anyone a little light-headed and dizzy. Combined with the points suggested in David's answer this was probably enough to tip you over the edge. Just getting off a bit more gently, and slowing down the urge to stretch (take the first bite of a snack first) could be enough. Don't underestimate the fatiguing effect of a strong headwind -- the same route isn't the same ride, and you don't get back the effort when you turn away from the wind. And as others have said, talk to the doctor 

One note of caution: This much load this far back affects the handling quite a bit. I built a rack extension when mine was younger and there were times when the front wheel had very little grip. I solved it by shifting weight forwards (D lock on the forks, handlebar bag for all the stuff you have to carry with a child etc. 

It clearly is OK sometimes: almost the opposite case to what you describe, i.e. when a faster cyclist has been gaining for a while but finally catches up at the lights, or has been stuck behind unable to pass because of passing cars. I've been in both sides of this situation and will sometimes invite obvious fast cyclists to get away ahead of me. Without condoning red-light running, some people get away very early at lights. I'd rather they were in front of me than behind, itching to overtake. I've got enough to worry about with the cars. I've seen cyclists stop so far back in a bike box that there's no safe place behind them (with big vehicles around). Often these are the slow cyclists who don't position themselves clearly on front of cars but sometimes they're fast riders who don't want to unclip and are leaning on something. The sort of riders I'd normally let past. In this case a little discourtesy is less important than avoiding being in the blind spot of a bus turning the corner. That could be considered a general rule. Any kind of jockeying for position is not OK unless preceded by an agreement to race, to which my response would be "you go ahead". 

A single cable as you suggest would mean bad things happening for a single failure. Although lightweight bikes will always push the spoke count as low as possible they can still handle a broken spoke without automatically crashing. You also don't have enough degrees of freedom to dish a rear wheel even if you assume the wheel is self truing. If instead you consider replacing each spoke of a conventional setup with a cable you add the weight and part count of the fasteners (offsetting any saving in the spokes themselves). You still need the same tensile strength and there's no need for them to be flexible so a single thick strand is no worse than a cable of thinner strands so you're back to the same weight assuming steel. Plus fasteners. You might shave a little weight off in total using something like spectra rope but you would have to ensure no risk of fraying at the fixing points. To overcome all this optimally you'd need to redesign the hub and rim. That's expensive and reduces your market. There are always titanium spokes for those worried about weight. These would retrofit easily on a standard wheel. It would be nice to see an old set of wheels rebuilt with cable for demonstration purposes -- you wouldn't want to go fast but you could probably ride on strong fishing line with one piece for each side of the wheel. 

Tubes are quite forgiving, you should get away with it without much trouble. I've seen a 24" tube survive on a 26" wheel. Don't worry about the listed sizes, you've got an unusual wheel diameter and can't necessarily expect all tyres widths to make it onto the list. But the tube will be quite stretched (1 1/8 being smaller than 1 1/4 or 28<32) so you may be marginally more likely to get a puncture than you would with a tube of the right cross section. Probably not enough that you'd notice on the tyres you've bought though. You might have to fiddle about a bit mounting the tube and tyre, perhaps inflating it into the tyre to get everything on the rim without pinching the tube. 

There are a couple of factors that might come into play. The first is that you may be braking more than you think at the back. Which brake is controlled by your stronger hand? Are they adjusted the same? The second factor is dirt. The front wheel throws up dust and muddy water, some of which can reach the back wheel even with mudguards. This can abrade both the pads and the rims. This will be much reduced on disk brakes. If you use the brakes a lot downhill you may find yourself using the back lightly to stop yourself accelerating. This seems to cause quite a lot of wear, perhaps because the brakes don't remove the dirt like they would in a hard stop and perhaps because it's a lot of wheel revs with the brake touching the rims. I used to notice this on stock pads and the cheap dual compounds I first replaced them with. The KoolStop pads I now use wear much less and I don't notice a difference. This is on ordinary shimano V brakes. This was despite only taking up the slack in the back brake when coming to a hard stop, but I had a couple of steep downhills. 

It's probably 36 mm; that seems reasonably common. Most seatpost racks go up to 31.8 mm Taking 36 mm as a guess makes searching much easier: it's an upper limit for some models: It seems easier to find a trunk bag attachment for such a large post. There is such a thing as a Rixen & Kaul KLICKfix Caddy Post and Bar Clamp 2016. That would allow you to mount a handlebar bag on the seatpost, or this Vaude mount is designed for their trunk bags but could be used with other things. None of these are of much help if you want to choose a pannier to suit you. Traditional style racks do exist, such as this Atran Velo Luggage Carrier Active Seatpost (which seems to have curved sides, but many panniers would still fit, and it's quick release). The search that turned up that last one (and the Vaude) was 

One of my bikes has cantilever brakes on chrome rims. With dual compound Koolstop Eagle 2 pads braking is adequate and I can rely on the front brake at least in the dry. The back brake squeals like a stuck pig. I could easily make it stop, but it's a much more effective warning than a bell or a shout when someone steps out in front, or when the lights change while passing stationary traffic. I like this feature. I'll restrict this to dry conditions as wet rims obviously change the behaviour. I can drag the brake lightly without squealing, or lock up the back wheel, but intermediate braking almost always produces a loud squeal for quite a range of pressure. My issue is the almost. This morning was dry, and I tested over a number of stops without using the front brake. All were from around 20 km/h (10--15miles/hour) and were planned but fairly sharp stops. Excluding when I skidded the back wheel on a dirty bit of road, it squealed with no thought on about 80% of the stops. On the other 20%, no modulation could produce a squeal. Why?
