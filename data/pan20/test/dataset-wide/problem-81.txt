Not at all! Firstly, the Romans lack the metallurgy and the manufacturing process. Secondly, they wouldn't understand the basic mechanics of internal combustion engines. Building a tank embodies many centuries of technical development and millennia of skills and knowledge to make them. They could make a copycat tank out of wood, but it couldn't move or do anything useful. Also, the cost in terms of resources would be too great. The concept is a non-starter. Sounds cute, but that's all. 

You are building a world and in your world wormholes, as we understand them, are real. Therefore, according to your scenario portal A has remained on Earth while portal was transported at relativistic velocity and returned to Earth. A clock at the mouth of portal A would show 2004, while portal B's clock shows 2012. This means there is a time differential of eight years between the two portals. Let's move forward in time to year 2048 and Bob decides to step through portal B. When he emerges from portal A he will have arrived in 2040. This is due to the eight year time difference between to the two portals. Unfortunately, Bob doesn't have the correct visa for 2040 and is sent back through portal A. he re-emerge from portal B back in 2048. Alice, on the other hand, steps into portal A in 2048 and when she exits portal B she will find herself in the year 2056. Two portals consisting of two wormhole mouths with a time difference of eight years will enable people to travel in time back and forth between intervals of eight years. Specifically, in this instance, time travel can be only accomplished in eight years intervals. For example, if Alice having arrived in 2056 decides she wants to see more of the future steps through portal A again. She emerge from portal B in 2062. If she wanted to go further forward into future, say, the year 2848, then she have to pass through the pair of portals one hundred times to eventually get there (if starting from 2048). Naturally it will take one hundred passages through the pair of portals, in reverse order, to travel back to 2048. To be clear, Alice will have step into portal B to exit from portal A and keep doing this until she is back in 2048 again. Wormholes, based on the concepts we know and that emerge from our current understanding of science, although there are major caveats as to whether this could be a viable technology in the real world, however, in a fictional world using wormholes for time travel is scientifically plausible. This time travel will be limited to "jumps" equivalent to the time difference between portals. 

Provided by unlimited size, you mean unlimited microscopic size, because that is what "just constrained by raw materials and solar energy" means when only microscopic amounts of raw materials and solar energy are available. 

The paper offers the following concluding statements. While they are somewhat sweeping and broad, they do give a favour to arguments supporting a role for the influence of the magnetosphere on plant evolution. 

If the bulk of the star was composed of helium (He-4) and the equivalent of a gigantic gaseous core reactor was assembled at its centre, this could consist of UF-6 and He-4 mixture, once the fission reaction process was initiated the nuclear reaction core, provided the surrounding He-4 bulk mass could act as a default containment vessel this might be a fission powered star. Since this model is a conceptual extrapolation of a gaseous core nuclear reactor system to stellar dimensions, there are many factors that are imponderable without extensive analysis. Basically the thermodynamics and hydrodynamics of a stellar-sized nuclear reactor. The engineering issues in assembling such a construct are considerably non-trivial too. 

Now if it's about the integrity of the universe that's reasonably straightforward. But first, let's consider a universe created out of mind. because this seems to be what this question is about. It would be unexpected to find such a cosmos in a state of total chaos. With reality warping and twisting into some new shape at every new thought. This is clearly not the case. Assuming our world could be such a world. Now there could be hierarchies of minds shaping reality. lesser minds thinking humbler thoughts making humbler levels of reality. toms, molecules, dust, bacteria, viruses and cells. More complex minds will build higher levels of reality. Because chaos is unfriendly to active cognition these minds will eventually arrive at a consensus of sufficiently stable cosmos in which they can function. This would start to resemble our reality. However, there is one ingredient that will ultimately stabilize creation into the scientific model. That most powerful of powerful intellectual tools. This is, of course, mathematics. Because mathematics depends on a logical framework independent of quotidian reality, or so it seems, and yet we know physical reality slavishly follows the dictates of mathematics. Once the minds embodied in creatures like ourselves, human beings or other sapient lifeforms, and they began using mathematics the absolute integrity of the universe was guaranteed. Add two plus two and you confirm arithmetic. Describe Riemann geometry and gravitation as general relativity is reiterated. With the framework now embodied in and incorporated in the minds creating the universe this stabilize reality according to the rules and logic of mathematics. This will be a universe of the kind we know and it will be stable and its integrity mandated throughout eternity or until we reach the end of the natural numbers and then some. 

Quantum computers effectively run all possible calculations simultaneously. Current quantum computers are fragile systems and can only handle a few qubits at best. By the time interstellar travel has been developed it is not unreasonable to assume quantum computers have developed to the stage where they are as common as conventional non-quantum computers. All the factors that make quantum computers will have fixed. They work well, their operations stable, robust and reliable. However, when spacecraft travel beyond the confines of our solar system the reliability of quantum computers disappears, their operations become so erratic that they can no longer be trusted to control the systems of an interstellar spacecraft. The cause is simple. In a planetary system such as our solar system there is sufficient matter in relatively close proximity to damp out any interference effects emanating from all other versions of a quantum computer in the multiverse. Since there will be an infinite number of different versions of any quantum computer across the multiverse the uncertainty in its operations will also become infinitely uncertain. When the damping effect is no longer present states in a quantum computer no longer correspond to any given program running on it. This effect will become progressively worse the further from any large masses like stars and planetary systems the starship travels. Quantum computers can used reliably on interplanetary spacecraft and inside planetary systems, but in the depths of interstellar travel they are too hazardous to use. 

This is a complicated matter of planetary geology. Some guidance can be found by looking at the solid planets in our solar system, specifically the planets of the inner solar system. The simple answer is yes, but this comes with caveats. Namely, something like this can occur, but it may not be that simple. Particularly if comparisons are made with the planets Mars and Venus and our own Earth. Let's start with the planet Mars. 

As Thucydides said "Both books are dystopias about the gathering and wielding of absolute power over the peoples of the world." In the mid-twentieth century the prevailing fear was about totalitarian governments radically disempowering their people. In the early 21st century governments have less power instead what we see is corporations engaged in "the gathering and wielding of absolute power over the peoples of the world." The destruction of the narrative of power constructed by the previous holders (politicians, academics, and the media) is part of the process. With many of ills created by untrammeled corporate power being blamed on governments whose regulations and safeguards would protect people and curtail many of those corporate-created ills. The current wave of the politics of fear and finding enemies to blame is the Orwellian dimension. While social media, online gaming, a porn-saturated media, and unbridled consumerism accompanied by all its social status machinery is the Huxleyan model. It's not difficult to bring them together. Both dystopian programs are alive and well and busy making our world the world they want it to be. It's our world only writ larger and nastier. 

The extraterrestrial humanoid exemplar of this problem in being able to increase or decrease their hearing at will is the Kryptonian. The simplest model for Kryptonian super-hearing would be that the Kryptonian's hearing is permanently super. They can hear everything all at once within the range of their super-hearing. The auditory cortex of their brain processing the acoustic information does so selectively to filter out all the unnecessary sound and noise. But this processing would enable to select for specific sounds like someone crying "help!" or more particularly if the person crying help was, for example, Lois Lane. This is a more advanced version of Cocktail Party situation where people can pick out specific words or person's talking from the hubbub of the background noise in the party. Kryptonians also possess super-intelligence among their many powers and abilities far beyond those of ordinary mortals. This suggests their capacity for raising and lowering their hearing at will should be a normal function of the superhuman auditory processing of their brains. 

The OP requested a hard science answer for a question that essentially doesn't need or effectively never needed a hard science answer. Why? Because the black hole clock as proposed is an absurdity. Also, it is completely unnecessary. This answer shall not attempt demonstrate why a back hole clock is an absurdity. Many of the other answers demonstrate the problems involved. There is a currently existing technological that will perform the necessary timekeeping for a Kardashev III civilization. The ideal timekeeper for a galactic civilization is a pulsar clock. 

John Cramer's tachyon Drive This is one of the best concepts for a space drive. Energy and momentum are conserved. The physics is more than a little speculative, but being speculative shouldn't be a problem for science-fiction. 

Superintelligence would be both more complex and subtle than the suggested abilities you have given your person with a giant mind. In fact, total recall is a handicap rather than an asset. There is a famous study of a Russian afflicted with a total recall memory. if I find it I will add in an edit. As for being a super-calculator, again that doesn't very much at all. Even WWII mechanical calculators could do as well. He could get a job as a computer with that calculating skill. A computer in WWII was a person who did the long, laborious calculations associated with scientific research or actuarial tables. This sounds more like an idiot savant than an intellectual superman. As for the power of making deductions, again this is overrated. Deductions are often a poor way of thinking through problems. Sherlock had his Doctor Watson, but more importantly he had his author, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, on this side to ensure everything came out right. If you want to construct a superintelligent person, consider the full gamut of intellectual and cultural skills where learning and problem solving are at their highest. The capacity for languages, mathematical skills, the sciences, linguistic skills in writing and talking, the ability to persuade people, to tell jokes, a deep psychological understanding of people, and strategic planning (by this I don't mean simply military tactics, but the ability to plan how complex activities or organisations can be done or run). Foremost among the abilities and skills of any superintelligent person would be his ability to learn anything and everything extremely fast. He will have a habit of coming up with totally unexpected solutions to problems. This will be due to his superlative level of creativity. It is an open question whether his superintelligence would extend to controlling and facilitating his motor skills because if it did he would be the best athlete or sportsman in the world. Also, if he's really smart, he will have learned long ago how to conceal his superintelligence, and to blend in with normal human beings.
