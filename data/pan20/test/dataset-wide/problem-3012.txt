As a start, consider taking an infinite disjunction that happens to be true and adding another term at the end, that happens to be false. In evaluation, would you ever get to that last term? Obviously it makes the whole thing false, but you have an infinite task to exhaust before even considering it. We want finite proofs. So should we consider this provably false or throw it into some ambiguous category? What if we somehow imagine replacing each term of our infinite sequence with another infinite sequence? Things get weird. Infinitary languages, and transfinite sequences in general, create a lot of such silly problems. So in logic, outside of the theory of orderings itself, we generally prefer transfinite sets but only arbitrarily long sequences. The fact that quantifiers are over sets and not sequences lets us have that. If you want to model quantifiers as infinite statements, they are sequential. So you are pulled down a certain rabbit hole into transfinite induction and the vagaries of ordinal representations. 

Schopenhauer's 'Will to Live', which Westernizes the Buddhist notion of suffering through attachment, seems closest, especially if you focus on discontent. The thread of Buddhism he taps into is less resigned to the world's power over humans. It has a goal of escape. So it suggests we have the alternative of not being driven by these forces, but overcoming them instead. The flow of reasoning he pulls this into comes out of Epicurus and feeds back into Nietzsche and Freud. So the rest of the stream around him on the Western side emphasizes positive emotions over negative ones. 

(The framing seems to assume some form of physicalism, so I am going to answer in terms of modern physics. There are good philosophical reasons to question physicalism. But I do not think this is part of the question.) The closest concept that enters physics is information = negative entropy, the ability to direct energy so that it does not disrupt an expected state. Physics does include entropy, which measures the orderliness of a system, as a real thing, especially in thermodynamics. According to thermodynamic principles, the overall entropy of a system must increase over time, but positive entropy can be traded for negative entropy. This means that we (and other forms of life) must expend energy in some way that causes waste, in order to retain the predictable patterns on which knowledge relies, and over which it gives us influence. So your observation that it can be multiplied without loss is not true. Some energy must necessarily be expended and turned into an unusable form, or no more information can be created. Those people remembering it have to eat, the paper that book is printed on had to grow and will rot, those bits stored in a computer require current flow in a circuit, that recorded medium will degrade over time and will have to be copied before it is unreadable, etc. 

As the flip side of my defense of the idea there are Republican principles separate from Conservatism, I would like to lay out how 'Republican', or basically American, Conservatism varies from its more general forms elsewhere. And that, contrary to surface appearance, Conservatives in America really do have something in common. Conservativism in the United States is not about maintaining centuries-old structures, with standing claims of hegemony, like it can be elsewhere. It can't be, because we only became a country two centuries ago. What traditionalists here therefore tend to fall back on is clarity, simplicity, finality and forthrightness. They want to preserve the literal content of our civic institutions, or at least the original intended meaning behind our foundational traditions. The basic principle is that what is allowed to grow and adapt will get out of control, so we need to continually pin it back to the past, or we will become weak as a nation. They want a very literal reading of the Constitution, which limits the power of the Federal authority, and particularly extends very little power to the Presidency, federal Departments, and all other Federal Executive authority. Although this 'States Rights' agenda is often blamed for being a cover-story for regional interests, such as Confederate slavery. It seems clear (to Conservatives) that the enumeration of responsibilities for the Federal government is meant to favor regional interests over uniform governance in all other realms outright, and no cover story is ever needed. As part of that, they want as few ongoing mandates upon the Federal government's future actions as possible. (Our originators did not even want a standing army, just the ability to train militia and draft them at need, so deeply did they want to limit governmental promises. Modern Conservatives would not join them there, but the underlying principle remains -- often in the form of Milton Friedman's theory that democratic government can only grow, and so should do so a slowly as possible, or the 'Two Santa System' (symbolized by Bush II's giving away the surplus income tax) intended to immobilize the government by keeping revenue low and maintaining fiscal dread, until spending can be rolled back.) Since a few of the original colonies (from Pennsylvania to Maryland) were established as religious reservations meant to get extremist leaders to move out of England, American Conservatives want to be allowed to be religiously literalist, often in an Evangelical or traditionally Roman Catholic way, and to have the government either back hegemonic religious positions, or get out of the way, and let regional authorities reconcile them. They also want to promote a civic and moral framing that allows the original and historical behavior of 'Great Americans' to remain honorable and unsullied. (History like all other things, including, impossibly, scientific understanding, should be finalized early.) So they want to restrain attacks upon traditional biases incorporated into our laws early on, including regionalism, White racism, and traditional gender roles. 

Freud, the originator of the concepts that grew into our notion of the 'subconscious', would surely disagree with your first point. He was attempting a form of biological reductionism when he proposed the psychoanalytic theory. All of his reasoning about primary process thinking and remnants of the developmental process is meant to reduce human motivation to biology and history. The theorization of the primary process does not increase the perceived complexity of thought, or render it more holistic and independent of biology. Instead it reduces the apparent complexity by presuming that emotional and logical resolution happens in passes, much like Chomsky's notion of deep-structure and transformation makes language more easily modeled mechanically, rather than less so, by theorizing layers of processing that can be detached from one another and separately analyzed. In fact, the idea that a good part of your everyday motivation is not conscious to you ties the mind to the body more strongly. It leaves decision-making activity in the brain that may or may not be in the mind as it is imagined by idealists. If an obsession is something like a seizure, then interest and focus are biological things, not esoteric qualities of mind. And even if subconscious content is taken to pump up the volume of what is mind, the few well-articulated forms (starting from the various forms of psychoanalysis, but also including cognitive-behaviorism and other models) all do so by presuming a separate layer of mind that we share with animals or a layer of the mind that is shared between humans. Few absolute mind/body dualists want the idea of mind distributed around the biological tree or attributed to groups and cultures. It makes for a muddy wake of confusing issues around what kind of things do and do not think. This does not help arguments that start from looking inward, as most dualist philosophies have. If 'mind' is not primarily a human aspect, it would make just as much sense to look into the behavior of a dog, or of an army, as of a man. It would give the process some objectivity and perspective. So, while I am personally convinced of the role of the subconscious, and there are whole journals are devoted to psychoanalytical research, with a major component of their content devoted to grounding the theory in fact, I see it as a theoretical step away from, rather than toward mind/body dualism. 

Nietzsche clearly evaluates past moralities as constructive or destructive, and expresses strong feelings about the goal of a life from 'One must make of one's Self a work of art' to 'Man is what must be overcome' and boundaries on action 'Fighting monsters we must not be made monsters'. He expresses these as truths. And he feels urgent value from the eternal recurrence he deduces from Newtonian physics (if incorrectly, with a classical sense of math.) It is hard to see him, then as a total skeptic relative to shared facts, even facts about values. Even if, in the end he prefers an aesthetic sense of truth over some obligatory objectivity, he feels aesthetics have a certain kind of objectivity, or he would not bother to quarrel with Wagner. A lot of 'critical theory' people launch from there and simultaneously undermine or devalue all of our shared standards of aesthetics as well, and that leads to the notion of global anti-realism. But they cannot cast that whole debt back on Nietzsche, they generally need to pull in Marxism, psychoanalysis or other leverage to accomplish the more important half of the task. From what I understand of Leo Strauss position on Nietzsche, he thought that Nietzsche had to be an outright nihilist by assuming that he did not accept myth as a form of truth. This is much the same thing I see critical theorists doing, but he is using the remnants of an abstract Platonism that he himself rejects, to undermine the sense of realism in myth. It is true that Nietzsche explicitly describes these as contrasting categories, but clarity of language often suffers from art. He can't mean this too wholeheartedly, because he then fights very hard on the behalf of his own myths. To my mind, relativism is not nihilism if one accepts that shared myths and aesthetic standards will speak to others in a meaningful way, and that they are worth maintaining for that purpose. 'Choose your delusions' is a form of relativism as an exercise in political aesthetics that is therefore not nihilistic. It can, in fact lead to very strong religious sentiments, in a way that real Empiricism or Pyrrhonism cannot.
