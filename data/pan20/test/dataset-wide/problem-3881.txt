Let $F(A)$ be a class of real-analytic function on an interval $A \subset \mathbb{R}$ minus the zero function. We have the following theorem for $F(A)$. 

Let me outline the classical proof and explain why I am interested in this question. Choose some function $g(X,Y)$. Then, \begin{align} E[ (X-E[X|Y]) g(X,Y)] \le \left| E[ (X-E[X|Y]) g(X,Y)] \right| \le \sqrt{ E \left[ (X-E[X|Y])^2 \right] E[g(X,Y)^2] }. \end{align} Therefore, \begin{align} E \left[ (X-E[X|Y])^2 \right] \ge \frac{\left| E[ (X-E[X|Y]) g(X,Y)] \right|}{E[g(X,Y)^2]}. \end{align} The proof is completed by choosing $g(x,y)=\frac{d}{dx} \log (f_{XY}(x,y) ) $ and noting that then $ E[ (X-E[X|Y]) g(X,Y)]=-1$. This gives us the Cramer-Rao lower bound \begin{align} E \left[ (X-E[X|Y])^2 \right] \ge \frac{1}{E \left[ \left(\frac{d}{dx} \log (f_{XY}(X,Y) ) \right)^2 \right]}. \end{align} The choice of $g(X,Y)=\frac{d}{dx} \log (f_{XY}(x,y) ) $ always seemed mysterious to me (but this is not the main reason for ask this question). That is why I am wondering whether there is a more "natural" proof where the quantity $\frac{d}{dx} \log (f_{XY}(x,y) )$ appearance is more obvious. For example, it would be nice if we can derive an inequality by showing that \begin{align} E \left[ (X-E[X|Y])^2 \right] = \frac{1}{E \left[ \left(\frac{d}{dx} \log (f_{XY}(X,Y) ) \right)^2 \right]}+c, \end{align} where $c$ is non-negative. 

An irreducible quintic $f(x)\in\mathbb{Q}[x]$, is solvable by radicals if and only if its sextic resolvent $\theta_f (y)=(y^3+py^2+qy+r)^2-2^{10}\Delta(f)y$ has a rational root ($\Delta$ is the discriminant of $f$, and $a,b,c$ are some defined rationals, see the Cox reference). In many cases, this associated sextic is not pretty. More troublesome is that in my work I am often coming across quintics with the coefficients in terms of some parameter, where in general we cannot use the Rational Root Test on the sextic. Any advice on proving the (non)existence of a rational root of the sextic resolvent of an irreducible rational quintic (especially sufficient criteria for non-existence)? Examples or references to special cases are fine. Is the usual technique just ad-hoc tricks? References: 

Given the vector space $\mathbb{R}^n$, endowed with the standard inner (dot) product $\langle\cdot,\cdot\rangle:\mathbb{R}^n\times \mathbb{R}^n\to\mathbb{R}$, the problem of almost-orthogonal sets asks, for each $\epsilon> 0$, for the construction (or at the very least, bounds on the cardinality) of a maximal subset $S$ of $U_n$, the set of unit vectors of $\mathbb{R}^n$, such that $\forall x,y\in S: x\ne y\implies |\langle x,y\rangle|\le\epsilon$. For known results, see Matt Cheung's Major Qualifying Project monograph at this link. Question: What are known results, if we restrict ourselves to some subset of $U_n$? Specifically, I am interested in the subset $\lbrace\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}},-\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}\rbrace^n$ consisting of the vertices of the scaled-down unit cube inscribed inside the unit ball centered at $0$. 

I want to solve the following optimization problem \begin{align} \inf_{ X: |X| \le a \text{ a.s.}} E \left[ \frac{1}{1+(X-X^\prime)^2} \right] \end{align} where $X^\prime$ is an independent copy of $X$ and $a>0$ is some constant. How would one approach such a problem? Is the solution easy to find? At some point I thought that the optimal distribution is given by $X=\{-a,a\}$ equally likely. In which case, the solution is given by \begin{align} \inf_{ X: |X| \le a \text{ a.s.}} E \left[ \frac{1}{1+(X-X^\prime)^2} \right] \le \frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{1+4a^2}+\frac{1}{2}. \end{align} However, I don't have any supporting arguments for this. The following might be useful. Note that by Jensens' inequality \begin{align} E \left[ \frac{1}{1+(X-X^\prime)^2} \right] \ge \frac{1}{1+E[(X-X^\prime)^2]} =\frac{1}{1+2Var(X)}. \end{align} Therefore, \begin{align} \inf_{ X: |X| \le a \text{ a.s.}} E \left[ \frac{1}{1+(X-X^\prime)^2} \right] \ge \frac{1}{1+2 \sup_{ X: |X| \le a \text{ a.s.}} Var(X)}=\frac{1}{1+2a^2}, \end{align} where in the last optimization step we used \begin{align} Var(X) \le E[X^2] \le a^2, \end{align} which is achievale with $X=\{-a,a\}$ equally likely. 

Let $Z$ be a standard normal. Now define \begin{align} g(t)= E[ f(Z-t)] \end{align} where $f(x)$ is a real-analytic function and $|f(x)| \le x^4$. Question: Is it true that $g(t)$ is also a real analytic function? If this is true can we show this without using complex analysis tools? 

Theorem. The Galois group of a quintic polynomial $f\in\mathbb{Q}[x]$ is $A_5$ if and only if its discriminant is a rational square and its Weber sextic resolvent has no rational root. Question. What are known infinite families of of quintic polynomials in $\mathbb{Q}[x]$, each with Galois group $A_5$? I am aware of two explicit such families as follows. Example 1. $f(x)=x^5+(5t^2-1)(5x+4)$ for $t\in\mathbb{Z}$ such that $t\equiv\pm 1\pmod{21}$. This is Exercise 3.7.2 in the book Generic Polynomials by Jensen, Ledet and Yui. Example 2. $f(x)=x^5+(t^2-5^5)(x-4)$ for non-zero $t\in\mathbb{Q}$ such that $\forall u\in\mathbb{Q}: t\ne g(u)$ where $g(u)=\frac{(u^3-18u^2+8u-16)(u^3+2u^2+18u+4)}{2u^2(u^2+4)}$. This is from the paper Reducibility and the Galois group of a parametric family of quintic polynomials by Lavallee, Spearman and Williams. Note. Both are all trinomials, presumably because it is easier to construct polynomials with square discriminant when some coefficients vanish. It would be nice to see otherwise. 

Could you state or direct me to results regarding the Diophantine equation $a^2+b^2=c^2+d^2$ over integers? Specifically, I am looking for a complete parametrization. In the case that a complete parametrization does not exist, I would be interested in seeing complete parametrizations for special cases. For example, in the case that any one of the variables is zero, we are led to Pythagorean triples. Taking a variable to be some non-zero constant would be interesting. I'm looking for known results as I am not as familiar with the literature as many MO-ers out there. 

Maybe It is time to sum up the work that has been down up to now : Let $X$ and $Y$ be normed spaces, and $f$ a function $X\to Y$. Denote by $\cal C$ the condition "$||x-y|| = n\in \mathbb N \Rightarrow ||f(x)-f(y)|| = n$". 1) If $\dim(X)=1$, no proper condition can be added to $\cal C$, and even to the stronger condition set by the asker, that would imply that $f$ be an isometry (MikeTex) ; 2) If $\dim(X) > 1$, then $f$ is an isometry if and only if $f$ is continuous and fulfills the condition "$||f(kx)-f(ky)|| = k||f(x)-f(y)||$ for every $x,y$, and every $k\in \mathbb N$" (MikeTex) ; 3) If $X$ and $Y$ are Hilbert space and $\dim(X)>1$, then condition $\cal C$ implies that $f$ is an isometry (Terry Tao) ; 4) More generally, if $\dim(X)>1$ and $Y$ is strictly convex, then condition $\cal C$ implies that $f$ is an isometry (Eric Wofsey). It is interresting that the additional condition $||f(x)-f(y)|| = n \Rightarrow ||x-y|| = n$ present in the question of the asker has not been used in the argument of Eric Wofsey (hence is unnecessary, if used, in the argument of Terry Tao). The question is now : can this additional condition be used in order to weaken the assumptions of Eric and Terry. 

Let us consider the equation $a^n+b^n=c^n$ for positive integers $a,b,c$ and $n\ge 2$. The $n=2$ case has a well-known and beautiful parametrization known as Pythagorean triples. Fermat's Last Theorem gives us that there are no solutions for $n\ge 3$. It can be observed from the literature that Diophantine equations involving a sum of individual variables to some like power, i.e. $a_1^n+\cdots+a_k^n=b_1^n+\cdots+b_m^n$, are considered to be among the most "attractive" of problems. Maybe with more controversy, it can be said that constructing (a family of) solutions is easier with a greater number of terms, thanks to the added flexibility. In this sense, Fermat's question of splitting a power into two same powers in the "tightest" question. This brings us to the next tightest equations, which add one more term: For which $n\ge 2$ do $a^n + b^n + c^n = d^n$ or $a^n + b^n = c^n + d^n$ (call them $(1)$ and $(2)$ respectively) have solutions in positive integers, what are some solutions, and can we find all of them? We are looking at non-trivial solutions, so in $(2)$, $a,b$ are distinct from $c,d$. Of course, families or full parametrizations represented by polynomials are the prettiest. I read somewhere that full ones exist for $n=2$ in each case, but a reference would be nice. Now $n\ge 3$ is a murky area, as far as I can tell. One famous result is Elkies' counterexamples to Euler's quartic conjecture, so $(1)$ has infinitely many solutions for $n=4$. The Mathworld pages on 3rd powers and 4th powers say that families of solutions to $(1)$ are known for $n=3$, as well as for $(2)$ for $n=3,4$. At this point, for larger $n$, there seem to be no known solutions to either equations; correct me otherwise please. So my question is: What are references to results on larger $n$ for these two equations? Has it been proven that no integer solutions exist for some, probably large, $n$? Maybe even all sufficiently large $n$?
