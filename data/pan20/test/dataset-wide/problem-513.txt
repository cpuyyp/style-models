If the effect of wind resistance was linear with respect to speed, then yes, the forces would balance out. That is to say: if pedaling into a 20 mph wind was only twice as hard as pedaling into a 10 mph wind, the forces would balance. But this is not the case, as @Daniel mentions. The effort to overcome the 20mph wind is more than twice that needed for the 10mph wind. If we simplify your loop into an out-and-back (half directly into the wind, half with it at your back), say the wind is a constant 10 mph, and that you cycle to maintain 20mph, you can get an intuitive idea of how this works. With those assumptions, for half your trip you would be fighting a 30mph headwind (10 wind + 20 from your own speed). The second half the "headwind" would be only 10mph (20 from your own speed - 10 from the wind). This is compared to a day with no wind, in which the whole trip would have a headwind of 20mph. The jump from 20mph to 30 requires much more energy (what is the last time you hit 30mph?) than the energy saved from dropping from 20 to 10mph. Drag varies as the square of velocity. This means that velocity is the dominant factor in the equation (as opposed to drag coefficient). From wikipedia: 

For an excellent treatment of the forces affecting a cyclist, see Rainer Pivit's article. The graphs are especially helpful. 

Trek still makes a steal touring bike, the 520. Should make a great, heavy duty road bike. Note: the shifters are on the bar ends and the gearing is that of a mountain bike. May be a problem depending on your preferences. Another option is the Specialized AWOL, for which just the frameset can also be ordered (thanks @mikes). 

According to Boca, they are 3/16" for the front and 1/4" for the rear. I see no reason why you can't run ceramic bearings in them. 

I agree with the tips jimirings has stated, but if possible I would sell the Rockhopper and pick up a second hand jump bike - they're simpler bikes and park oriented ones rarely see the outdoors so tend to be in a better condition than their dirt brethren. The Rockhopper's geometry is wholly unsuitable for street/park riding, it's too tall, designed for 100mm forks, and has long chainstays; which all adds up to bike that doesn't want to bunny hop and struggles to to be 360-ed. It is designed for a completely different use and environment. And I say this with experience, I used to own one, and I also tried converting my sisters to a street style - absolute failure. 

As someone who has given numerous dérailleurs smacks against rocks, which were light enough impacts to just be able to bend the cage back, but strong enough to split the jockey wheel - I'd say yes! 

Just to add to the other answers: There are special tools, but they're just plastic wedges, so a flat blade screwdriver is fine. 

Personally I don't think there is general right or wrong answer, every situation is different. The above is just my take on what you have written. 

You will also need to make sure the eye-to-eye length is same as your current shock (that's the distance from the centre of the pivot hole in one end to the pivot centre in the other), and that the stroke length is the same. If either of these is wrong, it will change your bikes geometry and possibly even cause the rear tyre to bottom out against the seat tube. 

I am a bike commuter without a car in California, that seems to be such an unusual combination that it is difficult to find insurance. I have health + disability insurance, my bike is worth less than $1000. I don't own property and don't have a homeowner's or renter's insurance, nothing worth to steal. I'd like to get liability protection for the case that I cause an accident. What type of insurance do I need? Am I overlooking something else I need to insure against? Update: I talked to a couple of insurance companies (Allstate, Farmers, Geico) and asked for umbrella insurance, all of them were initially very dismissive of the idea to insure someone without a car. All three told me on the phone there was no way to get a non owners auto insurance, they absolutely needed the type of my non-existing car and the VIN. They also told me that you cannot get umbrella insurance if you don't have auto insurance. I doubt this, but that was the reply. I then looked into renter's insurance, and that does indeed cover liability for bike accidents, they confirmed this on the phone. I found an insurance broker, who offered me renters + umbrella for $655 per year. State Farm has a very high liability renters insurance for about $250 per year, both 1 million coverage. I am still doubtful if 1 million liability coverage is enough. In Germany you are required by law to have at least 7.5 mio Euro coverage for personal damage and 1 mio for property damage if you have a car, but that is the absolute minimum. Most insurance policies have a limit of 100 mio Euro. In principle the required product seems to be a renters insurance, or a non-owners car insurance for people who occasionally drive. The problem is that the insurance companies don't have much experience with the car-less cyclist and can't help much choosing the right product. 

You turn it on when riding on smooth surfaces or going up hill to improve pedal efficiency. It's hard to know if you will need it in advance because without riding the bike you won't know how well the suspension design handles pedal bob (the energy lost by the bike suspension compressing under pedal forces), try and get a test ride. 

You seem to be forgetting the second-hand market, a grand can get you a fantastic 2-3yr old bike of any variety. If it was my money, I would much rather have a 2yr old bike that was worth £2.5K new, than a £1K new bike. Paint scratches don't affect the ride. 

I would say the rear hub's freehub is damaged. Pop it off the hub body and inspect where the pawls are (mind the pawl springs don't ping out!), look for broken pawls and/or mashed ratchet teeth (the teeth which the pawls engage with). Post some pictures of it if you are unsure. 

Firstly clean all the metal bits floating about the BB from the threads being cut. You can usually just look at the state of the threads at this point to see how bad the damage is. Your eyes should be able to follow the grooves around uninterrupted, if you can wind the BB back in OK, and it tightens as normal then you should be fine. Because the force a BB is subjected to is perpendicular to the thread direction, the chance of it pulling out is very slim. If you ever do truly annihilate your BB threads (remember cross threading is a pretty common issue in engineering), you could probably get an engineering works to drill out the existing thread, press a steel shim into the BB tube, and then thread that. I've seen it done on smaller fittings, so I don't why it wouldn't apply to larger ones.
