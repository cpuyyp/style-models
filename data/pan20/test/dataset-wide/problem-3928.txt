Final edit The answer to your question is positive for $n>1$, and this follow just from the fact that a holomorphic function defined on the complement to a pseudoconvex domain can be always extended to the domain for $n>1$. For $n=1$ the statement not true (as Pietro Majer says correctly says it). There is a reference now given in a comment by Margaret Friedland that justifies this answer. In the case that you consider there is a holomorphic map from $M\setminus K$ to $\mathbb C^n\setminus \bar B_1$, i.e. you have $n$ holomorphic functions on $M\setminus K$. Each of these functions can be extended to $M$ provided $n>1$ since $K$ is pseudoconvex in $M$. So you get a proper holomorphic map from $M$ to $\mathbb C^n$. Moreover this map is birational (or of degree one in other words), so $M$ is a contractible topological space only if the map is an isomorphism (otherwise there will be some exceptional divisors on $M$ that will be contracted to points by the map and so the topology of $M$ will be non-trivial). Here is the mathscient citation for the reference given by Margaret Friedland "The authors prove the following: If $M$ is a ﬁnite complex manifold with connected boundary $bM$ such that the Levi form has one positive eigenvalue everywhere on $bM$, then every function on $bM$ which satisﬁes the “tangential Cauchy-Riemann equations” on $bM$ has a holomorphic extension to the whole of $M$." Note that the boundary of a ball in $\mathbb C^n$ has positive Levi form (for $n>1$) and the "tangential Cauchy-Riemann" equation is automatically satisfied provided the function is defined and holomorphic in a neighbourhood of $bM$. Clearly we can assume the later in our case. 

I assume that by a double point we mean a points of multiplicity two. In this case the singularity $x^2+y^3+z^6=0$ is a double point which is an ellitpic hypersuface singularity in $\mathbb C^3$, it is not rational. For more examples you can check Chapter 4 in Miles Reid's notes $URL$ 

Much of the theory of compact 3-manifolds relies on decompositions into canonical pieces, in particular the Kneser-Milnor prime decomposition [12, 16], and the Jaco-Shalen-Johannson characteristic splitting [10, 11]. These have led to important developments in group theory [22, 7, 9, 24], and form the background of W. Thurston’s geometrization conjecture, which has recently been proved by G. Perelman [19, 20, 21]. For open 3-manifolds, by contrast, there is not even a conjectural description of a general 3-manifold in terms of geometric ones. Such a description would be all the more useful that noncompact hyperbolic 3-manifolds are now increasingly well-understood, thanks in particular to the recent proofs of the ending lamination conjecture [17, 4] and the tameness conjecture [5, 1]. The goal of this paper is to present a series of examples which show that naive generalizations to open 3-manifolds of the canonical decomposition theorems of compact 3-manifold theory are false. 

Edited. Here is a construction of curves $C$ on a four-dimensional quadric $Q^4$ such that $TC\subset Q^4$. I am sure that this is a classical construction, (it might be I saw it previously and forgot). Construction. Recall that $Q^4$ is isomorphic to $G(2,4)$ -- the Grassmanian of $2$-planes in a four-dimensional space, or equivalently to the space of in lines $\mathbb P^3$. The isomorphism is given by Plucker embedding of $G(2,4)$ to $\mathbb P^5$. Now, take any curve $C'$ in $\mathbb P^3$ and associate to it a curve $C$ in $G(2,4)$ consisting of the collection of lines tangent to $C'$. I claim $TC\subset Q^4$ once we identify $G(2,4)$ with $Q^4$. The proof is left as an exercise. PS. I think it will be more interesting to answer the following question: For each $n$, what is the maximal $k(n)$ such that $Q^n$ contains "non-degenerate" $k(n)$-dimensional subvariety $C^{k(n)}$ of arbitrary high degree, such that $TC^{k(n)}\subset Q^n$? I am pretty sure that the above construction can be generalised to show that $k(n)$ tends to infinity when $n$ tends to infinity. In fact from the very first glance it is not clear (for me) why the behaviour of such varieties $C$ should not have resemblance with algebraic Legendrian varieties about which you can read, for example, here : $URL$ . 

The answer to the question in the beginning should be YES and it follows from the answer to your previous question. We just need to use the fact that if $G$ has unsolvable word problem then $G*F$ too, where $F$ is a group and $G*F$ is the free product. To construct the example take the solution to the previous question, namely a $4$-manifold $M^4 $embeddable in $S^4$ with unsolvable word problem. Now take an open ball $B^4$ in $M^4$ and cut from it a small copy of $M^4$, that we call $N^4$. Finally dig a wormhole that connects $N^4$ with $S^4\setminus M^4$. This divides the sphere into two connected 4-manifolds each of which is homotopic to a connected sum of two manifolds, one of which has same fundamental group as $M^4$. 

Let me show that the answer to this question is positive for $d>3$. Indeed, for a general surface $X$ of degree $d>3$ its Picard group is $\mathbb Z$ and is generated by $O(1)$. It follows that both curves $C_1$ and $C_2$ are complete intersections, and so they have the same Hibert function (see for example Section 13 pages 172-173 in book of Harris "first course in algebraic geometry"). Hence the statement is proved. 

Here is an answer to the REFINED question given to me by Richard Thomas. In this refined version we want an example such that the cohomology classes of two symplectic forms coincide. In a later paper 1996, Duke Vol. 83 TOPOLOGICAL SIGMA MODEL AND DONALDSON TYPE INVARIANTS IN GROMOV THEORY, Ruan proved that such refined examples exist. He admitted in this paper that for the $V\times S^2$ examples from the paper in JDG 1994 (cited by Mike Usher) he does not know if the classes of constructed symplectic forms can coincide too. In fact this does not seem very plausible. These refined examples are two $3$-dimensional Calabi-Yau manifolds, constructed by Mark Gross. The construction is described in the paper of Mark Gross (1997): "The deformation space of Calabi-Yau $n$-folds with canonical singularities can be obstructed". One $3$-dimensional Calabi-Yau is a smooth anti-canonical section of $P^1\times P^3$ and the over is a smooth anti-canonical section of the projectivsation of the bundle $O(-1)+O+O+O(1)$ over $P^1$. The construction of Gross is recalled on the pages 47-48 of $URL$ Using Wall's theorem Ruan proves that these two Calabi-Yau manifolds are differomorphic. Then he studies the quantum cohomology rings of these Calabi-Yaus and proves that there they are different. 

This is a bit too long for a comment, but since it was requested, below a positive answer in the case $N=2$ is given. This might also help to understand the question in the simplest case. So we start with a smooth quadric $Q=0$ in $\mathbb P^2$ and two more quadrics $Q_1=0$, $Q_2=0$ such that the non-fixed locus of intersection of $Q$ with the linear system $Q_1+tQ_2=0$ is a single point (so the corresponding map $Q\to \mathbb P^1\supset t$ is degree one, i.e. birational). Such situation can happen only if both $Q_1$ and $Q_2$ intersect $Q$ at the same set consisting of three points, or two points of which one is with multiplicity 2, or at one point with multiplicity $3$. Let us denote this set by $x$. Then it is clear that for any generic pencil in the family generated by $Q,Q_1,Q_2$ the fixed locus is $x$ plus one point. If you translate this into the notations of the original problem you see that the map from $\mathbb P^2$ is birational. 

1) Ricci flow on open 3-manifolds and positive scalar curvature. Laurent Bessi`eres, G´erard Besson and Sylvain Maillot. $URL$ Thanks to G. Perelman’s proof of W. Thurston’s Geometrisation Conjecture, the topological structure of compact 3-manifolds is now well understood in terms of the canonical geometric decomposition. The first step of this decomposition, which goes back to H. Kneser, consists in splitting such a manifold as a connected sum of prime 3-manifolds, i.e. 3-manifolds which are not nontrivial connected sums themselves. It has been known since early work of J. H. C.Whitehead [Whi35] that the topology of open 3-manifolds is much more complicated. Directly relevant to the present paper are counterexamples of P. Scott [ST89] and the third author [Mai08] which show that Kneser’s theorem fails to generalise to open manifolds, even if one allows infinite connected sums. 

Since on any symplectic manifold you can easily find an almost-Kahler metric, this question can be reformulated as follows: "In the realm of symplectic geometry , to what extent , the hard Lefschetz property is still holds?" The answer is: It does not hold to a very large extent. There are a lot of examples of symplectic manifolds, where this property doesn't hold. In fact, checking that the hard Lefschetz property does not hold for a given symplectic manifold is one of the most favourite tools to establish that a given symplectic manifold is not Kahler.

This is not a complete answer to the question, and I don't know if a complete answer is written down anywhere in the literature. In the first revison of the answer I tried to adress all the 10 comments that my previous answer recieved. The second revison contains a conjecture (that I am 99% sure of) describing the complete answer to this question. The first point is that the classification of symplectic surfaces can not be simpler than the classification of surfaces up to a diffeo. And the classification up to a diffeo of non-compact surfaces is quite a delicate subject. It is desribed for example in the paper $URL$ 1963, ON THE CLASSIFICATION OF NONCOMPACT SURFACES, IAN RICHARDS. In particular one phenomena apears here -- a certain ideal boundry of the surface. This idel boundary is a totally disconnected, compact separable space. I guess a good illustration will be a disk from which we throw away a Cantor set on the x axis, Cantor set been the ideal boundary. Let us give now some examples that illustrate the additional phenomena that happen for non-compact surfaces, if we take in account the symplectic form. First of all there is the simplest case when the surface has finite topological type. In this case we have two topological invariants, the fundamental group, a free group on $n$ generators plus the number of punctures (or boundary components) $m$. In this case a complete classification of symplectic forms can be given. Either the surface has a bouned are $A$, in this case this area is the only invariant. Or it has an infinite area. In this case there are $m$ types of surfaces. Namely for every boundary (or puncture) we can check if it has on open neighborhood that his finite area, or not. The number of components near which the area is unbounded can be any between $1$ and $m$. Example. Consider $S^2$ with two delited points. Then either it has finite area, or it is symplectomorphic to an infinite cylinder $S^1\times R^1$ with the form $ds \wedge dt$, or it is symplectomorphic to $R^2\setminus 0$, with the form $dx\wedge dy$. If the number of punctures is countable, and every puncture has a neighborhood that is diffeomorphic to a punctured disk, then the situation should be very similar to what I have described above. Namely 1) the area can be bounded. 2) The number of UNBOUNDED punctures for wich every neighborhood has infinite area is bounded, in such surfaces are enumerated by natural numbers. 3) The number of unbounded punctures is infinite, in this case we just need to cound the number of bounded punctures, that can be finite of inifinite. CONJECTURE. Here is the conjecture telling what should be the complete answer to the question. Take a non-compact surface. Then the set of symplectic structures of infinite area on it is in one to one correspondence with closed non-empty subsets of its ideal boundary. For every bounded A>0 there is a unique symplectic strucutre on the surface with given area. In the case of a surface with puncutres, the ideal boundary is just the union of punctures. Below the statement of this conjecture is proven for some simplest examples of surfaces. I think, that the general case should not be much different. For the simple examples that I have descirbed the proof should be ALMOST identical to Moser's argument. Indeed the simplest examples have the following property: these surfaces can be decomposed in a countable union of compact pieces, all of which apart from one piece are annuli, and one piece is a compact surface with a boundary. Now, on a compact surface with a boundary (as well as on the cylinder) the symplectic form is uniquely defined by its area -- this can be done by Moser argument (we need that in a neighbrohood of each boundary the symplectic form is strandard, which is automatic in our case). Now the symplectomorphism can be constructed inductively. Consider for example the case of $R^2$ of infinite area. We can take any exostion of $R^2$ by cylinders. For example we indroduce some coordinates on $R^2$, and conisder cylinders of radiuce $n,n+1$. We don't care what is the exact expression of w. The crucial thing for us is that the sum of areas tends to infinity. Now we take the standard $R^2$ and take a decompositon in concetnric cylinders of needed area. Then define the symplectomorphism from the standrd $R^2$ cylinder by cylinder. For the class of surfaces, that I dealed with same thing should work. Though I am not sure that this is the best "proof" of the statement. I think it is not hard to prove this conjecture as well in the case of the complement to a Cantor set in the unit disk.
