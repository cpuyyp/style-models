I don't have the quotations. But I think I remember that Emperor Maximilian I (died 1519) had a child sized suit of armor made for his grandson the future Emperor Charles V (1500-1558) even though Charles could only use it for a fe years. I think I also read something about ceremonial suits of armor being made for the pages of a 17th century Emperor, probably boys not yet of full stature. Russian Tsar Peter II (1715-1730) is sometimes depicted in armor, despite dying at the age of 14. Of course he might have been painted in imaginary armor. $URL$ This Roman boy in partial armor is possibly Imperator Caesar Marcus Ophelius Diadumenianus Antoninus Augustus (209-218) $URL$ In short, there is evidence that boys sometimes used more or less complete armor. So bigger and stronger bodyguards could also do so. But the medieval guards of an Emperor, king, or noble usually just used normal dress. Often they might be dressed in the ruler's livery colors or have his badge on their clothing or have uniforms in the late medieval period. Body guards might use armor in battle or in fancy ceremonies, but probably not for everyday use. 

Actually the question is inaccurate. The bald eagle is not the national bird of the United states of America, unless someone can point out a congressional resolution making it the national bird. Many or all states in the USA have state animals, state fish, state flowers, state birds, state trees, etc., etc., etc., adopted by various resolutions of their legislatures. so it is possible that the Congress of the United States sometime decreed a national bird of the United States. But you should find a record of it happening before saying that there is a national bird of the United States of America. In 1782 the congress needed a great seal for the United States. A seal is 1) a pattern or design, 2) a device for impressing that pattern on wafers of wax, lead, gold, or other materials, and 3) the wafers of wax (or other materials) impressed with the seal pattern or design and attached to documents. In those days it was normal and usual to attach seals (3) to documents such as deeds, appointment or release of guardians, wills, etc. etc., instead of or along with the signatures of the parties involved, to authenticate and give legal force to those documents. Many of the members of congress had their own seals which they used on their own personal documents, so it was very unseemly for the aspiring national government they served to not have a great seal of its own. The usual design of a seal had the name of the person or organization and the coat of arms of the person or organization. In those days the coat of arms of a realm was considered far more important than its national flag. The coat of arms of the United States of America is technically "Argent [silver or white] six pallets [thin vertical bars] gules [red], a chief [horizontal bar at the top] azure [blue)], though it is legally but incorrectly described as "Paleways of thirteen pieces, argent and gules, a chief, azure" in order that the thirteen original states are mentioned. It is obviously based on the national flag which was adopted in 1777. $URL$ It is perfectly proper to display a coat of arms by itself, as on a heraldic banner, but it is common to depict a coat of arms in what is called an "achievement" with various heraldic accessories. Among the main heraldic accessories are supporters, usually a pair holding onto the shield or cartouche with the coat of arms. The US has a single supporter, a bald eagle "displayed" with the wings spread, brown, with white head and white tail feathers. I don't know if the color of the beak and claws is specified. The coat of arms is placed on the breast of the eagle. The eagle has an olive branch (green) in it's dexter claw, (the eagle's right one, on the left as seen by the viewer) and thirteen arrows argent in it's other, "sinister", claw, and faces to the dexter side as is normal with heraldic animals. The eagle has a ribbon with the motto "E pluribus unum" in it's beak, and above it's head is a round, cloud-like "glory" with thirteen stars argent on a blue field. Thus the bald eagle is not "the national bird" of the United States, which may not even have any "national bird", but instead the supporter and largest piece of the national coat of arms. The achievement of arms of the United States is used as the basis for the arms and seals and flags of most federal government departments and agencies and is seen on the regimental colors and standards of military units. I suggest that possible inspirations for the design of the US coat of arms would have been realms with similar decentralized governments, especially since the coat arms as adopted during the looser Articles of Confederation and not the more centralized constitution. It has been suggested in other answers that the bundle of arrows was suggested by arms of the United provinces (the future Netherlands). The US coat of arms does not seem to have much resemblance to the arms of the Swiss Confederation. Of course the largest and most famous decentralized realm was the Holy Roman Empire, which had many realms and states within it that all used their own coats of arms, flags, and great seals, as well as the coat of arms, flag, and great seal of the Emperor of the Romans. At that time the coat of arms of the emperor (Joseph II) as "Or [gold or yellow] a two headed eagle displayed sable [black] with haloes around the two heads, holding a sword and scepter in the dexter claw and an orb in the sinister claw." The eagle carried a shield on its breast with the arms of the lordships, counties, landgravotes, margravites, duchies, kingdoms, etc., that the emperor as the hereditary ruler of. the supporters were two griffins, black and gold, and on top of the shield was an imperial mitre crown. $URL$ 

Officers were usually too busy commanding to shots at the enemy. There are a few exceptions, as always. General George Crook, for example, was sort of a one man army. As a lieutenant he reportedly shot six Pitt River warriors, as lieutenant colonel and brevet (honorary) general he reportedly shot a Paiute and an Apache, as a brigadier general he reportedly shot a Sioux or Cheyenne. But that was just a minor little sideline to his tactical, strategic, and negotiating skills that resulted in the surrender of many thousands of hostiles. 

Here is a reducto ad Absurbum of the idea that "train" only refers to a railroad train. J.R.R. Tolkien, writer of Lord of the Rings, was a professional philologist and knew the meanings of words. In the Silmarillion chapter on the Dagor Bragollach, "The Battle of Sudden Flame", Tolkien describes a sudden attack by Morgoth, the original Dark Lord, on his unsuspecting enemies. First the Mountains of Iron and the peaks of Thangorodim belched out fire and lava. Rivers of lava flowed over the camps of his enemies. Then came Glaurung the Golden, Father of Dragons, in his full size and power that had never been seen before. "in his train" were balrogs (terrible war demons) and then came innumerable armies of orcs. Obviously Morgoth wasn't going to delay his surprise attack to wait for the lava flows to cool and solidify and then build a railroad line over it for the balrogs to ride in. These events were fictionally supposed to happen sometime between about 13,000 BC and 11,000 BC. Unless someone claims to be a better philologist than Tolkien, they should give up any claim or thought that "train" always and only refers to a railroad train. 

Early Japan had close relations with early Korea. In eras before the dawn of really good and accurate history, those relations may have involved at least one Korean conquest of at least some parts of Japan and/or at least one Japanese conquest or colonization or overlordship over at least one part of Korea. Naturally, nationalistic Korean and Japanese historians have argued over the evidence for decades and even centuries. In a much more historical era Toyotomi Hideyoshi, the Japanese warlord, planned to conquer Ming China but failed in his preliminary attempt to conquer Korea from 1592 to 1596, and 1597 to 1598. But he did rule various regions of Korea for months or years. 

In my humble opinion,the southern economy was devastated by centuries of political domination by big plantation owners. For centuries the southern economy was dominated by people who didn't pay for the labor of their workers. In the rest of the country poor young farmers could earn money by working as farmhands for other farmers and eventually have enough money saved to buy farmland either in their home area or in the west. But the rich plantation owners and the successful farmers in the south had slave labor and didn't need to pay for the labor of farm hands. And their higher profits enabled them to pay more for farmland. Since the rural poor were poorer and the rural rich were richer in the south than in other sections, the rich acquired more and more farmland and tended to push the rural poor into farming poor quality marginal land. The rich got richer and the poor got poorer much faster in the South than in the other sections. Since only the slave owning rich and the slave owning upper middle classes cold afford education, they dominated politics and made sure that legislation benefited the rich minority and not the poor majority. There was very little manufacturing or mining the South and the so there were only enough banks to supply the loans needed by the plantation owners. There was little money and little incentive to invest in mining or industry. In sort, the South had always been poorer than the north or the west. The seeming wealth of the southern economy had always been greatly exaggerated by the nominal value of slaves (who had zero average wealth themselves) belonging to the upper middle class and the wealthy, whose business was sometimes as much raising slaves for sale as it was using slaves to grow crops for sale. All the nominal slave wealth vanished when the slaves were freed. And of course the war was mostly fought in the South which was devastated in many regions. So I would say that the comparatively poverty of the South today is much more a legacy from centuries of low (or nonexistent) pay for labor and lack of opportunities for the lower class to get ahead than from the devastation of the Civil War, and much more from the devastation of the Civil War than from Reconstruction.
