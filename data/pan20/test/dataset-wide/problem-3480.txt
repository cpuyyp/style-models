I am not familiar with South Korean data; but I believe the Gini coefficient estimated by the US Current Population Survey does not exclude single households, meaning it's not a universal practice for Gini estimation. 

As suggested by the previous answer, definitely get rid of gas prices and median home value. You might also want to reconsider the way you look at the deficit, debt, and GDP growth rate as these are highly circumstantial; a better way to consider these as performance indicators is to compare their observed values to their trajectories at the end of the term of a predecessor. 

Used to be capital controls. You could only buy dollars (or any other foreign currency) through official channels at the official favorable rates by providing documentation displaying need for said currency (e.g. Travel or import documents). 

But it is, there is just a simple oversight in your calculations: We can indeed write identically $$\eta_{\lambda, J} = \frac{\partial \lambda}{\partial \theta}\frac{\partial \theta}{\partial J} \cdot \frac{J}{\lambda} \\ \implies \eta_{\lambda, J}= \left\{\frac{\partial \lambda}{\partial \theta} \frac{\theta}{\lambda}\right\}\left\{\frac{\partial \theta}{\partial J} \cdot \frac{J}{\lambda}\right\} \frac{\lambda}{\theta} $$ But the term in the second curly brackets is not equal to $\eta_{\theta, J}$. We have to re-arrange to get $$\eta_{\lambda, J}= \left\{\frac{\partial \lambda}{\partial \theta} \frac{\theta}{\lambda}\right\}\cdot \left\{\frac{\partial \theta}{\partial J} \cdot \frac{J}{\theta}\right\} \frac{\lambda}{\lambda} $$ The fraction in the end now cancels and so $$\eta_{\lambda, J}= \eta_{\lambda, \theta} \cdot\eta_{\theta, J} $$ 

This sounds like the standard "drop one dummy" requirement when binary characteristics are included in linear regression - because otherwise, we will get perfect mutlicollinearity and no-solution. Assume you have three subgroups, separated by age: Y(oung), A(dult), O(ld). You have reasons to believe that the effect of the treatment correlates with age-group, and you want to control for this association. If you include three dummies in the regression to that effect, you will create perfect mutlicollinearity - because if you sum these three columns of the regresor matrix row-by-row, you will get a series of Ones, which is already present in the matrix, since there exists already a constant term and so a regressor that consists of a series of Ones. In such cases, we exclude from the regressor matrix any one of the three control dummies (for many reasons it is not a good idea to drop the constant term instead of one of the dummies). This has the effect that the interpretation of the results becomes conditional on the group whose dummy we excluded: if say we specify $$y=\beta_0+\beta_1w + \gamma_1A + \gamma_2O+e$$ then $\gamma_1$ measures how much more (or less, if negative) being Adult affects the outcome, compared to being Young, and $\gamma_2$ analogously for Old. Situations of perfect (or near) multicollinearity may nevertheless occur even in this approach, depending also on the nature and distribution of values of the dependent variable. If the dependent variable is also binary, such possibilities increase, since we may have phenomena of "complete separation/perfect prediction" and the like. In general, including controls in treatment regressions is a standard approach, and very reasonable. Including dummies as controls, may have the above mentioned complications. 

In the framework of the ISLM model, a supply shock would be defined as any exogenous force that affects the ability of an economy to produce its natural level of output, this ability is represented by a production function that often relies on available resources and production technology. Therefore, any factors affecting the availability of resources or technology will be considered a supply shock (e.g. Drought and crops). On the other hand, a demand shock acts on aggregate demand by influencing planned expenditure by economic actors or the amount of real money balances that economic actors desire to hold. In short, if it affects available production inputs or production technology, it's a supply shock. Notice that the GDP is just a measure of all goods and services produced in an economy for a given period of time. If you use the expenditure approach to GDP (Y = C + I + G + NX), a supply shock will not immediately act on this formula, rather it affects the formula Y=F(X) (where X is a vector representing production inputs). But note that the two formulas, meaning the two "Y"'s must equal each other, therefore, there will be changes in the first equation to match the second equation at some level of Y. However, you can't differentiate these changes from changes arising due to a demand shock unless you have the whole story. You can't just look at "C" for instance, and assume that any changes in "C" resulted from a supply shock. 

Starting with your original equation: $max_{c_t, m_t, b_t} E_0\sum_{t=0}^\infty U(c_t, m_t)$ s.t. (1) $y+\frac{m_{t-1}}{1+\pi_t}+\frac{1+i_{t-1}}{1+\pi_t}b_{t-1}=c_t+m_t+b_t+\tau_t$ Here: $R_{t-1} =1+i_{t-1}$ and $1+\pi_t=\frac{P_t}{P_{t-1}}$ Note that in this problem, you have have two state variables, $m_{t-1}$ and $b_{t-1}$, and your main issue have been that you have bunched these together. your Bellman should be: $V(m_{t-1},b_{t-1})=max_{c_t, m_t, b_t} U(c_t,m_t)+E_t\beta V(m_t,b_t)$ s.t. (1) You can here use your contstraint to get rid of one control, or you can solve it using the lagrangian. If you use your constraint to substitute for $c_t$, your updated problem becomes: $V(m_{t-1},b_{t-1})=max_{m_t, b_t} U(c_t(y, m_{t-1}, b_{t-1},m_t, b_t, \tau _t),m_t)+E_t\beta V(m_t,b_t)$ For clarification: $c_t(y, m_{t-1}, b_{t-1},m_t, b_t, \tau _t)=y+\frac{m_{t-1}}{1+\pi_t}+\frac{1+i_{t-1}}{1+\pi_t}b_{t-1}-m_t-b_t-\tau _t$ FOCs: $[b_t$]: $-U_{c_t}+\beta E_tV_{b_t}=0 $ $[m_t]$: $-U_{c_t}+U_{m_t}+\beta E_tV_{m_t}=0$ Envelopes: $[b_{t-1}]$: $U_{c_t}\frac{1+i_{t-1}}{1+\pi _t}\implies V_{b_t}=U_{c_{t+1}}\frac{1+i_t}{1+\pi _{t+1}}$ $[m_{t-1}]$: $U_{c_t}\frac{1}{1+\pi _t}\implies V_{m_t}=U_{c_{t+1}}\frac{1}{1+\pi _{t+1}}$ You should be able to combine these equations such that you find the demand for money. To me, your equilibrium condition (along with the fact that no capital is present in the set-up) impies that there is no saving in real variables, and hence you have nothing that can pin down the real interest rate, and you therefore lack information to find the fisher equation. 

Market failures often arise due to deviations from the classical assumptions of economics (e.g. Perfect Competition, Perfect Rationality, Perfect Information, Unbounded Computational Capacity, ...etc). There are lists of well-documented and studied market failures and the factors driving them (monopoly is sometimes considered a case of market failure); however, there cannot be an exhaustive list as that would be equivalent to placing a bound on the number of ways people can behave unexpectedly 

There's a very fine point that needs to be mentioned: The participation rate is the percentage of adult population of a country that is capable of work and wanting to work, individuals who are capable and wanting to work are the labor force. Now when unemployment is measured, it is typically the percentage of individuals in the labor force who actually have the kind of employment (in terms of time worked) that they desire. The importance of the participation rate is the following: when some individuals are unemployed for a long period of time, they eventually stop looking for work (the "willing to work" part is no longer valid) either because they've given up, or their skills are too outdated to be useful to the market. These individuals are dropped out of the labor force. Assuming all else is constant, these unemployed individuals leaving the labor force means there are less unemployed individuals as a percentage of the total labor force (lower unemployment rate), but now the participation rate is lower (smaller labor force divided by same total adult population). Therefore, unemployment numbers aren't really telling you the whole story if you assume that people dropping out of the labor force would actually want to work if they had found work, and thus unemployment rates alone may give a better picture of how workers are actually doing. In short: Unemployment rate = total employed/ labor force Participation rate = labor force/adult population As for the retired, I believe those are considered outside the labor force. Example: Assume a coal miner has no other job market skills than the ability to mine coal. Assume country X bans coal mining. All coal miners are left without a job but will not search for a job because they can't do any other job. The unemployment rate is unchanged, but the participation rate drops. Very generally: 

Given a utility function $u(c)$, $c>0$, with $u'(c)>0, u''(c) <0$. Regarding the sign of the second derivative, if it is zero, then both measures are zero, if it is positive, it would imply increasing marginal utility, and I don't remember having seen these attitude-towards-risk measures for such a utility function. Denote Absolute Risk Aversion ($ARA$) and Relative Risk Aversion ($RRA$) correspondingly by $$A(c) = -\frac {u''(c)}{u'(c)},\;\;\; R(c) = cA(c), \;\; A(c) = \frac 1c R(c)$$ 1) Monotonicity of $A(c)$ in relation to $R(c)$ $$\frac {\partial A(c)}{\partial c} = \frac {\partial [(1/c)R(c)]}{\partial c}= -\frac 1{c^2} R(c) + \frac 1{c}\frac {\partial R(c)}{\partial c} $$ So if $$\frac {\partial R(c)}{\partial c} \leq 0 \Rightarrow \frac {\partial A(c)}{\partial c} < 0$$ $RRA$ weakly decreasing $\Rightarrow ARA$ is strictly decreasing in $c$. 

The formulation quoted says: "Looking back at Figure 4-8, you can see that starting at the quota limit of 8 million rides, New Yorkers would be willing to pay at least $5.50 per ride when 9 million rides are offered." Note the bolded text. Assuming that a seller of rides can only charge one price regardless of which unit the seller is selling. The seller would then have to charge $5.50 if 9 million rides are to be sold. This price charged is the consumers' maximum willingness to pay for the 9th million unit. However, buyers are willing to pay more for earlier units, that is why the demand curve is downward sloping. Hence, if the seller is able to perfectly price discriminate, that is set different prices for each ride based on the buyers' willingness to pay for that particular unit, (s)he could charge different prices for each ride. For example, if I read your graph correctly, the seller could charge $6 for the 8th million ride. The seller will still be able to sell 9 million rides, and the price will be at least \$5.50 per ride. In fact, the only ride that will be sold for \$5.50 is the 9th million, all earlier rides will be sold at a higher price becaue the seller is charging exactly what the consumer is willing to pay for each individual ride. 

With a bit of humor, you could use the Schumpeterian term "creative destruction" -the humor relates to the fact that Schumpeter used the term to describe an inherent structural feature of capitalism, not historical/natural accidents/disasters. Apart from that tongue-in-cheek proposal, I am not aware of a compact term to express what you describe. A common way could be a "vintage theory of capital" approach, where it is recognized that "old and new" capital coexists with different levels of technology embodied in it, and so in a sense "averaging" the actual technological/efficiency level used in the economy. Then what you describe amounts to an abrupt loss of "old" capital which may lower the output level but creates a positive discontinuity in the actual average technology level used in the economy, creating abrupt and higer growth rates. You can broaden the concept of capital to also include "human capital" and maybe also "institutional capital" (and so "technology" will then refer also to "knowhow/experience" and "transactional technology" as well).
