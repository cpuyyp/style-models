Perhaps a volcanic eruption or a extra terrestrial impact created a crater with several concentric ring walls. The outermost ring wall looks like a very large island with steep cliffs rising out of the sea all around. Trying to land on the cliff side is very dangerous. If someone manages to land and climb up to the top of the cliffs they will see the top of the ring wall is rather thin and bare and treeless. On the inner side are more cliffs falling down to into the sea, connected by underwater passages, or maybe a freshwater lake formed by rainwater. And maybe from the top they can see all the way to the next inner ring wall, or maybe it is beyond the horizon. So there is no gap in the outer ring wall, no way to sail a ship through it, no trees to build a boat or a raft, and it would be be very hard to haul a boat up and then lower it into the inner body of water to explore it. Thus the outer ring wall will be mapped. But nobody knows how many inner ring walls there are and if there is a large island in the center. Does that make it isolated enough for 17th century technology? Possibly someone made up a myth that there is a central island that is a paradise or loaded with gold or something, and thus the protagonists foolishly believe the myth and seek to reach the central island without any proof there actually is one or what it may be like. 

If two planets' life forms evolved separately, diseases from one planet could probably not infect higher lifeforms from another planet, except that there could be rare exceptions when that was possible due to by coincidence two planets evolving very similar lifeforms. For example, diseases from planet A might only be able to infect lifeforms from one planet out of every thousand that had higher lifeforms, or diseases from planet B might only be able to infect higher lifeforms from one planet out of a million that had higher lifeforms. Except for extremely rare cases of two planets evolving very similar lifeforms, interplanetary and interstellar infections should only be plausible in stories set in fictional universes where the lifeforms on different planets are related due to natural or deliberate panspermia. $URL$ 

The Two Towers Book Three, Chapter Eight "The Road to Isengard". So the central roof of Orthanc was five hundred feet above the ground, with four higher tips of the piers around it. In The Fellowship of the Ring, book Two, Chapter Two "The Council of Elrond" Gandalf tells how he was imprisoned in Orthanc. 

$URL$ These pressures correspond roughly to pressures on Earth at altitudes of 30,125 meters or 98,350 feet to 57,150 meters or 187,500 feet - 30.125 to 57.18 kilometers or 18.626 to 35.511 miles. Even if the air pressure inside your sinkholes is only the same as at 4 kilometers or even 5 kilometers on Earth, and even if the air pressure of Hellas Planita is defined as the Martian air pressure, that would still reduce the needed elevation difference by only 4 or five kilometers to 25 or 26 kilometers or 15.534 to 16.155 miles. On Earth the difference between Mount Everest 8,848 meters, and the Challenger Deep, minus 11,034 meters, is 19.882 kilometers or 12.3541 miles. Because the Earth is an oblate spheroid, the difference between the farthest point from the Earth's center, the peak of Mount Chimborazo, at 6,384.4 kilometers, and the closest point to the Earth's center, the bottom of the Litke Deep in the Arctic Ocean at 6,351.61 kilometers, is 32.79 kilometers or 20.1 miles. But the atmospheric density would tend to be equally oblate as the Earth's surface instead of spherical, i think. Because rock on the sides of slopes a has a direction without presssure, it can collapse and slide down the slopes while rock inside a mountain has no place to go. Thus mountains and other elevation features tend to collapse and avoid reaching heights above the limits of their structural strengths. Thus it seems very unlikely that a planet similar to Earth would have a much higher range of elevation, sufficient for the one lowest spot on the surface to have a breathable atmosphere and for the one highest spot on the surface to have an atmospheric pressure as low as the highest atmospheric pressure on Mars. And of course it would be many times less likely for a planet to have the surface pressure of Mars, even the highest surface pressure of Mars, over the vast majority of its surface, and have several depressions deep enough to have breathable air at their bottoms. Stone just isn't strong enough for such depressions to avoid collapsing and filling in. 

An improvement on the answer by Logan R. Kearsley would be to have the men sit on stationary bikes connected to shafts that turn propellers. A metallic shaft turning metallic propellers would be stronger and sturdier than a set of wooden paddle wheels which were easily damaged by strong waves at see. Man powered paddle wheel boats and ships were used for hundreds of years by the Chinese, and as far as I know they were mostly used on rivers and lakes and near the coasts. I am not an expert on Chinese naval history but as far as know man powered paddle wheel ships were not used much at sea. $URL$ There was massive use of both paddle wheels and screw propellers on 19th century steamships and the result of decades of comparison is that paddle wheels were gradually phased out for ocean going vessels and reserved for river boats. Both side wheels and stern wheels were used for river boats but ocean going vessels seem to have almost entirely used side wheels or propellers. Furthermore, wooden paddle wheels were easy to damage in battle. And 19th century warships found that side mounted paddle wheels interrupted the long lines of gun ports on their gun decks. Eventually the many smaller guns on gun decks and poking out though gun ports were replaced by much fewer and many times more powerful guns in gun turrets above the main deck. After that side wheels would not have limited ship's armament. But by then ships were much more advanced than your "age of sail" requirement and steam engines would have been invented. Thus man powered propeller ships may be superior to man powered paddle wheel ships. And some consideration should be given to domestic animal powered ships. 

Maybe the bending powers include generating artificial light. Then the cities can contain enclosed hydroponic and aeroponic farms to grow food in a much smaller area than dirt farming would. If the benders can generate or acquire enough energy to levitate floating cities, they should be able to provide the much lesser energy needed to illuminate crops. Or maybe benders can synthysize food from various chemicals. Do your benders have to work in shifts to keep the floating cities floating, for example? If so, how does the floating city society ensure that there will be enough benders at every time to keep the city from falling to destruction? And does the society use similar practices to ensure that enough benders will produce enough food? Remember that magic in fantasy often takes the place of science and technology in science fiction, and vice versa. I can image some science fiction fans singing "anything magic can do science can do better" or some fantasy fans singing "anything science can do magic can do better". So you might want to read James Blish's science fiction "Okie" stories collected in Cities in Flight and perhaps get some ideas that can be modified for fantasy stories. And I remember some recent stories discussing how Tolkien's Dwarves could grow enough food in their underground cities. How can Dwarves produce honey underground?

Post-capture evolution of potentially habitable exomoons. Astrophys J. 2011;736:L14. $URL$ But I have my doubts that the rotation period of a moon could ever be shorter that the time it spends in the shadow of its planet during an eclipse. Thus on most or all habitable moons of gas giant planets the typical nights should last several times as long as the eclipses caused by the shadows of the planets the habitable moons orbit. Thus you should ask what the effects of those long nights are likely to be, instead of the effects of the much shorter eclipses. 

According to this List of Exoplanet Extremes: $URL$ The planets Kepler-70b and Kepler-70c approach each other to a distance of about 240,000 kilometers, and when they are at the closest approach, Kepler-70c would appear 5 times the size of the Moon in Kepler-70b's sky. But from what I see they are unlikely to be habitable planets. $URL$ From what I have read the potentially habitable planet with the shortest year is TRAPPIST-1d with a year 4.05 Earth Days long. $URL$ TRAPPIST-1E at closest approach to TRAPPIST-1d would be about 2.731 times as far as the Moon is from Earth, and has 0.91 the radius of the Earth. The Moon has a radius of 0.273 the radius of Earth, so TRAPPIST-1E has 3.333 times the radius of the Moon. At it's closest approach TRAPPIST-1E would appear 1.220 times as wide as the Moon from TRAPPIST-1d, though at other times it would look much smaller than the Moon. $URL$ So this example shows that it is possible for a potentially habitable planet to sometimes get close enough to another planet in its solar system to see that other planet at least as large as the moon looks from Earth. But if you want a situation where the other planet looks much larger than the moon from the surface of the habitable planet you will have to get someone else to construct your solar system and do the calculations. Another possibility is a habitable planet in a Trojan orbit with a gas giant planet and a star. If the star is a really dim red dwarf the habitable planet would have to orbit very close to the star. Thus the orbit of the habitable planet would be a relatively small one and the 60 degrees of separation between the gas giant planet and the habitable planet would be a relatively small distance. If the habitable planet and the gas giant planet orbit at 10,000,000 kilometers from the star, the two planets in a Trojan relationship would be about that far from each other. At that distance a gas giant the size of Jupiter would have an angular size of about 0.75 degrees or 45 arc seconds, about 1.5 times the angular diameter of the moon as seen from Earth. The smaller, habitable planet would actually move a lot around the exact L4 or L5 position, and would get significantly farther and closer to the gas giant planet, making it appear sometimes smaller and sometimes larger than calculated. Since TRAPPIST-1d is in the stellar habitable zone and orbits TRAPPIST-1 at only 3,330,000 kilometers, a habitable planet could be a third as far from its star as in the Trojan system above. Thus if the gas giant is as large as Jupiter it could appear 4.5 times as wide as the moon from the habitable planet in the Trojan position. Unfortunately Jupiter is almost as large as the largest possible gas giant. Gas giant planets much more massive than Jupiter are believed to have smaller diameters as their intense gravity compresses their atmospheres. Another possibility for a planet appearing very large as seen from a habitable planet would be a hot Jupiter. Hot Jupiters are gas giant planets orbiting very close to their stars and having very high temperatures, hundreds or thousands of degrees hotter than Earth. Some hot Jupiters are called "puffy planets" or "hot Saturns" because they are very large and have very low density. They are so hot that their atmospheres swell up and their diameters increase. WASP-17b, the puffiest known planet, has about twice the diameter of Jupiter and half of it's mass. Unfortunately, a habitable planet would have to orbit their star several times the distance of the hot Jupiter in order to have habitable temperatures. Thus their star would have to be a very dim one for their orbital separation to be only a few million kilometers. And the hot Jupiter would look the largest when it was between the habitable planet and the star and thus would look like a very thin crescent during the day. Also you might want to check out this: $URL$ And ask about calculating to make the distances between planets as small as possible. Thus my calculations indicate that it would be difficult to get another planet to appear more than a few times the apparent diameter of the Moon in the sky of a habitable planet. Possibly someone else can suggest a plausible orbital arrangement to make another planet look much larger. But if the habitable world is not a planet but a hypothetical Earth-sized moon of a gas giant planet orbiting in the habitable zone of their star, the gas giant can appear quite large in the sky of the habitable moon. And other large moons would appear to get larger and smaller as they orbited the planet. There are, of course, some limitations on the maximum and minimum apparent diameters of gas giant planets as seen from any habitable moons they may have. If the planet has a diameter between those of Neptune and Jupiter, for example, the planet's apparent diameter as seen from a moon at a specified distance would be between those of Neptune and Jupiter at that distance. And depending on the mass of the planet and the mass and distance of the star, there are inner and outer limits for the orbit of habitable moons. $URL$ Can a gas giant have its own habitable zone?7 

One possibility is an object that has an extremely eccentric orbit with a perihelion (closest approach to the star) not too far outside the tidally locked planet's orbit. And a resonant orbital period. Thus the object might complete exactly ten or a hundred or some other number orbits for every one the tidally locked planet does. The outer object with the eccentric orbit would travel faster the closer it was to the star as it got closer to the star. So when it was at perihelion it would be moving very fast as it swung around the star with enough excess speed to travel far back out again. And the duration of it's closest flyby of the star might thus be about the same as the period of the tidally locked planet's year/day. The light of the planet's star scattered around the daytime sky will drown out the light of most celestial bodies except the star. Especially if the atmosphere is more dusty or foggy or opaque on the sunward side of perpetual daytime. On Earth, objects visible in the daytime sky include: 1) the Sun, apparent magnitude -26.74 (the higher the magnitude the lower the brightness) 2) the Moon, apparent magnitude -12.90 at full moon, down to -2.5 at new moon. 3) comet Ikeya-Seki (1965) maximum apparent magnitude -10.00. The brightest comet to be visible during the daytime. 4) Iridium satellites. Maximum apparent magnitude of flares -9.5. 5) Supernova seen in 1006. Maximum apparent magnitude -7.5. 6) Crab supernova seen in 1054. Maximum apparent magnitude -6.00. 7) International Space Station. Maximum apparent magnitude -5.90. 8) planet Venus Maximum apparent magnitude -4.90, minimum -3.2. Objects with apparent magnitude less than -4.0 are not visible when sun high in sky. 9) planet Jupiter. Maximum apparent magnitude -2.94, minimum -1.61. 10) planet Mars. Maximum apparent magnitude -2.91, minimum +1.84. Objects with apparent magnitude less than -2.5 are not visible in daytime sky even when the sun is less than 10 degrees above the horizon. 11) planet Mercury. Maximum apparent magnitude -2.45, minimum +5.7. 12) star Sirius. Apparent magnitude -1.47. All other stars and planets are not as bright as Sirius. There are about 9,096 stars visible in dark skies to average human eyes from Sirius at -1.47 down to stars at apparent magnitude +6.5. Note that it is possible to see a few of the brighter stars and planets at twilight. Perhaps the nightsiders rule the twilight zone and keep the daysiders out of it. The tidally locked planet would not have a moon. The author can decide if the daysiders have any artificial satellites bright enough to be seen in the day. Comets bright enough to be seen in the day are rare in our solar system, and supernovas visible in the daytime are much rarer in our region of the galaxy (which is one of the necessary conditions for life on Earth). The author can decide if those conditions are different in his solar system. The author can decide if there will be any stars bright enough and close enough to be seen in the daytime of his planet. The author can decide if there are any planets in the solar system that sometimes get bright enough to be seen in the day. In short the author can ensure that the only celestial object the daysiders ever see in the sky (except for rare and unpredictable events like supernovae and daylight comets) is their sun. The nightsiders will see the stars all the time and count time by the time it takes for a particular star to rise above the horizon, reach it's highest point in the sky, and set below the horizon, and repeat. They will know that the outer celestial body will take a specific number of such periods to return to sight. So the only problem is to make sure that the outer celestial body is not bright enough to be seen in the daylight sky until it passes below the horizon as seen from the dayside. You may need to have someone run some computer simulations to find a set of orbits that makes the outer celestial body only visible when passing by the night side. It is possible that as the outer object passes close to the night side of the planet it suddenly flares up briefly in brightness due to developing a coma like a comet or having a frozen atmosphere that becomes vapor and makes the body much more reflective.
