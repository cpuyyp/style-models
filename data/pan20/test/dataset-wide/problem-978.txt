Mostly it is residual heat energy from when the Earth was very young. The biggest source came from the kinetic energy of all the bodies, big and small, that collided to form the Earth being converted to heat. The differentiation of the Earth added even more heat energy to the Earth. In addition to radioactive decay, the on-going freezing of the outer core material onto to the inner core adds a bit more heat to the system, but neither one compensates for heat transported through the mantle and crust and then out into space. Note that this heating from below is but a tiny portion of the overall energy budget for the Earth's surface. Even the Earth's surface was very hot shortly after the formation and differentiation of the Earth. While the surface cooled quickly (geologically speaking), the interior has not. The key reason is that 2,890 km of rock makes for a fairly thick blanket. 

The graph shows three marked drops in O2 levels, each corresponding to an extinction event. These are intervals 4, 9, and 11. Interval 9, the largest such drop, represents the end Permian event about 252 million years ago. Interval 11 corresponds to the end Triassic event, 201 million years ago. The unsourced wikipedia graph linked in the question has at most a superficial resemblance to this sourced graph. Now for your two questions. 

The Moon is not "full" of helium-3. 3He is at most fifty parts per billion of the lunar regolith1 and that "high" concentration pertains only to permanently shadowed craters. The Moon is bombarded by a steady stream of helium-3 while sunlit. Some of this incoming helium-3 is temporarily embedded in the lunar regolith. Without this steady supply, the helium-3 content would dissipate at a temperature-dependent rate proportional to the amount of helium-3 in the lunar regolith. The quantity $q(t)$ of in a cubic meter of lunar regolith is thus dictated by a simple differential equation, $\dot q(t) = \alpha(t) - \beta(T)q(t)$. Time averaging the bombardment and escape rates yields $\dot {\bar q}(t) = \bar{\alpha} - \beta(\bar T)q(t)$. This differential equation yields a steady state value of $\bar q = \bar{\alpha}/\beta(\bar T)$.

Let's suppose your conjecture is true. What signs would we see of a prior civilization? If the civilization was sufficiently advanced we would see a depletion of resources. If that prior civilization had advanced to the stage of sending stuff into space, we wouldn't see iron where we see it now. We see iron in very, very old banded iron deposits. We don't see any anomalous iron deposits in what would have been cities millions and millions of years ago. The same goes for coal and oil. Our first discoveries of oil and coil was stuff easily accessible from the surface. Easy pickings. Those easy pickings would not exist if some prior civilization had advanced to the Elizabethan stage, perhaps even Roman level. What if some calamity had wiped out humanity 2000 years ago? 10,000 years ago? What would a future civilization see millions of years from now? That's a better question. The answer is not much. That future civilization might well not see anything at all. Archaeologists have found fossil records of our ancestors, but that's because we humans are driven to look for those ancestors. A future civilization might not find any fossil humanoids that exhibited a tripling in brain size in just a few million years. That of course is assuming that intelligent life arose before humanity. That too is dubious. Evolution shows a more or less steady progression in brain size. Dinosaurs might not have been as dumb as people thought 50 years ago, but they were still pretty dumb. Their brains were reptilian. Science fiction writers love the idea of intelligent dinosaurs. That's a rather non-standard view amongst scientists. 

Don't rest so easy, ravenspoint. The Laurentide ice sheet at its maximum extent was larger than the Antarctic ice sheet is now. The bulk of that ice sheet melted in two pulses of 2000 years each, separated by the ~1000 year long Younger Dryas. During the first pulse, the Laurentide lost 5400 km3 of ice pear year. During the second pulse, it lost ice at an even faster clip, 5600 km3 of ice pear year. Source: Dyke, A. S. (2004), "An outline of North American Deglaciation with emphasis on central and northern Canada" in Quaternary Glaciations- Extent and Chronology, Part II, p. 373-424, J. Ehlers and P. L. Gibbard, eds, Elsevier. You want a SWAG, so I'll use 5000 km3 per year. That's just 5000 years for the Antarctic ice sheets to melt. The Laurentide ice sheet was able to melt quickly because a good chunk of it was outside of the polar circle. That's not the case for the Antarctic ice sheet, so this 5000 years most likely is an overly aggressive estimate. 

The chemistry of lead is very different from that of uranium and thorium. There are key kinds of rock that could not possibly have been formed with even the smallest amount of primordial lead. The lithophilic nature of uranium and thorium means that those same kinds of rock could easily have readily accepted primordial uranium or thorium. Any lead in those kinds of rocks must necessarily be the result of decay of uranium or thorium after the rock formed. 

Strictly speaking, solar panels tilt the Earth's energy balance ever so slightly toward greater warming. Solar panels have a rather low albedo. This means they absorb more sunlight than do most other materials. Increasing the amount of absorbed sunlight means that there has to be an increase in outgoing thermal infrared to keep the energy equation balanced. However, the portion of the Earth covered by solar panels is so minuscule that this theoretical effect is for all purposes a non-effect. Moreover, because solar panels produce electricity without emitting greenhouse gases, this theoretical negative effect becomes a positive effect when compared to producing electricity by burning fossil fuels. 

Your understanding is incorrect. The greenhouse gases are more or less transparent in the visible portion of the spectrum. These greenhouse gases are anything but transparent in the thermal infrared. It is the responses of these gases to thermal infrared radiation rather than the responses to the visible portion of the electromagnetic spectrum that results in the greenhouse effect. The outgoing radiation from a planet or moon has two key peaks, one in the visible / near infrared from reflected incoming sunlight, and the other in the thermal infrared from thermal radiation, the latter mostly from absorbed sunlight. The object is in thermal equilibrium when the energy from the incoming radiation from the Sun is in balance with the energy from the outgoing radiation (reflected sunlight and thermal radiation). An atmosphere with greenhouse gases affects this dynamic in that the greenhouse gases absorb some of the thermal radiation coming from below, only to re-radiate it shortly after absorbing it. Some of this re-radiated thermal radiation goes upward, some downward. The downward radiation makes the planet's surface warmer than it would be without those greenhouse gases. Some greenhouse warming is essential to life on Earth. The Earth would be a cold, barren place without the greenhouse effect. Just because some greenhouse warming is essential does not mean that more is better. Too much greenhouse warming is anything but a good thing. 

You need to be very wary of anything written in the non-scientific media about science. The media loves woo and controversy because those are the things that garners readers, and that in turn garners advertising revenue. By way of analogy, suppose as near-adult in gym class someone said "My gym shoes smell bad. Bad! Awfully bad!" Someone else would inevitably take a sniff. If it was bad, really, really bad, he would say so, while gagging. Someone else would say "That bad? Are you sure? Pass it over." That shoe would have quickly been passed around the locker room if it truly did smell worse than death. (Apologies if you are female; females don't do stupid stuff like this.) The non-scientific media love scientific articles that smell, particularly those articles that smell extremely bad. The media falls under the compulsion of passing these articles around. Good, solid journalism is sorely lacking nowadays. It's much easier to copy someone else's writing than it is to investigate. It's not plagiarism if the original source receives acknowledgement and a fee. You can typically trace those dubious reports that are all over the internet to a single source. So what's the source of this 27 million year recurring extinction event figure? It's two men who keep peddling this conjecture every other year or so. Here's the article that caused this imbroglio: A. Melott and R. Bambach, "Nemesis reconsidered," Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society: Letters, 407:1 99,102 (2010). 

The strong heat flux through the Earth's atmosphere, the presence of greenhouse gases, convection, and mixing conspire to push the troposphere away from thermodynamic equilibrium (isothermal atmosphere) and toward an adiabatic atmosphere. The natural drop in density with altitude means an adiabatic atmosphere is subject to a lapse rate, a nearly linear drop in temperature with increasing altitude. Temperature rises with altitude in the stratosphere because this is where the ozone layer exists. The troposphere is primarily heated from below. In contrast, the stratosphere is primarily heated from within via absorption of ultraviolet sunlight by oxygen and ozone. A similar situation exists in the thermosphere, which is where the extreme ultraviolet and higher frequencies of sunlight are absorbed. The thermosphere is where atmospheric temperatures attain their highest values. (BTW, you wouldn't feel those extreme temperatures if you put on a spacesuit and took a spacewalk in the thermosphere. There's hardly anything there that high up.) In between the thermosphere and stratosphere is where atmospheric temperatures attain their lowest values. This is the mesosphere. Most of the extreme wavelength radiation has already been absorbed in higher layers. The mesosphere is too thin to support an oxygen-ozone cycle. All that's left is radiational cooling supported by a strong greenhouse effect, making the top of the mesosphere (the mesopause) extremely cold. 

Earth's heat escapes into space via a complex set of processes. One is convection. Eagles, hawks, and other birds use those rising thermals to get a free ride to altitude. A second mechanism is latent heat. Evaporation of water is an endothermic process, meaning it absorbs energy from the surroundings (this is why sweating keeps you cool). Condensation is an exothermic process. While falling rain cools the surface, the net transfer is upward. Those rising columns of warm air can only go so high; they only rarely cross the tropopause (the boundary between the troposphere and stratosphere), and that is only in the case extremely unstable of conditions. Latent heat, along with birds, ride those rising columns of air. This brings up a third and the ultimate mechanism by which the Earth's heat escapes into space, which is electromagnetic radiation. Every object, including the Earth's surface, absorbs and radiates heat electromagnetically. The atmosphere does the same. The atmosphere absorbs most of the electromagnetic radiation emitted by the Earth's surface. (I qualified that with "most" because there is a small window in the thermal infrared that goes directly into space, at least when there aren't clouds.) This absorbed radiation is quickly re-emitted as thermal radiation, but in a random direction. The heat carried upward by thermals, by latent heat, and by surface radiation eventually does make its way into space as electromagnetic radiation. 

The oceans are not saturated in sodium or chlorine. In fact, the chemical makeup of the oceans has remained fairly constant for hundreds of millions of years. Yet rivers and other sources continually bring sodium, chlorine, and other dissolved elements and compounds to the oceans. This means some processes must exist that remove constituent elements at more or less the same rate that the world's rivers and other sources supply these constituents. It is true that the Earth's rivers bring substantially more calcium and carbonate ions to the oceans than they bring sodium and chlorine ions. Dissolved carbon dioxide from the atmosphere provides another source of carbonate ions. Yet the oceans are indeed substantially depleted of calcium and carbonate compared to the supply from rivers. So why is this? The oceans are substantially saltier than are the rivers that supply the oceans. This is primarily a result of evaporation. Even with that, sodium and chlorine are but a fraction of their saturation levels in the world's oceans. This is not the case for calcium and carbonate. Carbonates in general have a low saturation level, and amongst common cations, calcium carbonate has a very low saturation level. Calcium carbonate is typically at or near the saturation level in the oceans, and oftentimes above it, particularly near the surface. This makes it very easy for calcium carbonate to come out of solution. Because calcium and carbonate are at or above the saturation level, just about anything can cause calcium carbonate to form. The key "just about anything" process that causes calcium and carbonate to come out of solution is life. This means that calcium and carbonate have a rather low residence time in the oceans. The processes that remove sodium and chlorine are much, much slower. The slowness by which sodium and chlorine are removed versus the rapidity by which calcium and carbonate are removed are why the oceans are "upside down" compared to rivers with regard to calcium, carbonate, sodium, and chlorine.
