The actual range of the cannon would be based on a number of factors, such as the weight of shot, the elevation of the gun, the size of the charge (and the quality of the powder) and the windage of the gun (i.e. the space between the ball and the barrel). In the real world, it would be rare to find a battlefield that had a large expanse of dry, level, unobstructed ground to reach these extreme ranges. In most cases, damp, uneven ground and undergrowth would slow the progress of the ball so that it stopped short of the experimental maximums. An example of this can be seen in the ranges for a light 6-pdr field gun. At point blank (i.e. with the barrel horizontal) the range to first graze (i.e. the first impact with the ground) is 256 yards but the extreme range, when the ball comes to rest, is 1,630 yards. So the subsequent bouncing and rolling after the first impact is 1,374 yards, which is over 5 times the range to first graze. Higher elevations gave a longer initial range but reduced the subsequent bouncing/rolling. For the same 6-pdr fired with a barrel elevation of 4 degrees, the ball would travel 1,500 yards to first graze and stop at an extreme range of 1,800 yards. So, in this case, the additional range caused by bouncing and rolling was just a fifth of the range to first impact. Source: British Napoleonic Field Artillery, C.F.Franklin (Spellmount, 2012) 

In age-of-sail fleet actions, the primary use of frigates (and smaller vessels) was to relay messages (usually in the form of flag signals) between the flagships and the rest of the fleet. They usually set themselves some distance from the main 'line' of battle where they could see and be seen by the ships of the line. A secondary purpose was to act as tugs and rescue vessels for the ships of the line when they were dismasted or even sinking during or after the battle. In the case of a sinking or burning vessel, it was not unknown for frigates to act to save the sailors regardless of whose side they were on (as they were then considered non-combatants). As well as saving their own ships, it was also possible for them to take possession of enemy prizes when their ships of the line were unable to do so. Given these roles, it's not surprising that the unwritten rule of not firing on the smaller ships arose. It was a great benefit for both sides to have ongoing signalling through the battle and, likewise, useful for both sides to have a source of rescue available if needed. It should be noted that throughout the Napoleonic Wars (which edged towards total warfare), as frigates had grown considerably larger and more powerful, observance of this rule was starting to wane considerably. 

A large part of the French "Black Legion" under the American Colonel Tate, which invaded Wales in February 1797, was made up of convicts. An action referred to as "a singular expedition of jail birds" by French author Captain Desbriere. The plan of attack was devised by General Lazare Hoche, who had also conceived a similarly ill-fated attack on Ireland a couple of months earlier. The idea was that a small force would be landed in a relatively unprotected part of the British Isles. They could then use a form of guerilla warfare to cause damage out of proportion to their small number and provoke a lower-class revolt. 

The simple answer is that there is no direct or meaningful way of converting burthen tonnage to displacement. As the article you linked to notes, burthen tonnage was a rough calculation based on the length and beam of a vessel. This calculation varied over time and from country to country. When it was devised, it was intended as a measure of a ship's comparative carrying capacity for the purpose of taxation (at a time when warships were simply merchant ships with more guns). So comparing burthen tonnages would tell you which ship was larger only if you are comparing ships from the same country and era. The burthen calculation is obviously an approximation and takes no account of the ship's actual hull form or design. It's therefore possible for two ships which have the same length and beam dimensions (but with very different hull forms and loadings) to have the same burthen tonnage but different displacement tonnages. Similarly, two ships of the same displacement (but different hull forms) could have very different burthen tonnage measurements (and length/beam measurements). 

All that the description - "a brig of 200 tons" - really tells you is that the vessel was brig-rigged, that is it had 2 masts (fore and main), and it had an approximate hull volume calculated at 200 tons (not to be confused with displacement). Some sources make the distinction between a brig and a brigantine, while others might not. The hull form could vary depending on the ship's intended use and the time period in which it was built. Teak was a common contruction material for vessels in Asia, where it was more plentiful than the oak that was the preferred material in Europe. 

Prior to the establishment of HMS Excellent, gunnery was something that was learned on the ship, and thanks to almost constant wars in the 18th century, it was something that they had plenty of practice at. There was no service-wide system of gunnery training or drills. The amount of training that was performed was dictated by the individual ship's captains. As a result the standard of gunnery could vary greatly from ship to ship. The War of 1812, in particular, highlighted the shortcomings of this approach, and it was thanks to the experiences and criticisms of officers such as Philip Broke (of HMS Shannon) that the naval gunnery school was finally established. 

Interestingly, this seems to suggest that the act was (a) repeated more than once for a given punishment and (b) was not directly, or intentionally, fatal. A footnote in "The Life and Works of Sir Henry Mainwaring" (from a work by Boteler) suggests that keel-hauling might have evolved from the punishment of ducking: 

If you don't care if they were actually used in combat, then the German V-3 cannons would certainly seem to be in with a shot (pardon the pun), with a projected range of 165km. If you're including land-based guns that fired straight up, then Project Harp had a 'range' of 180km. 

So all in all, ramming in a sailing warship wasn't a good idea. However, once reliable steam engines were available, ships were no longer dependent on the wind and wind direction, and (in theory) armor protection meant that they could approach their targets at less risk. It should be noted that the transition from wind power to steam power did not happen overnight. When the first ironclad rams appeared many of the warships in the world were still of the traditional wooden sailing variety (as were almost all of the merchant ships) or simply had an armor belt above the waterline with a wooden hull beneath. In theory, the steam powered ironclad should be able to out-maneuver the sailing ship and then use its ram to punch through the weaker wooden side of the target (so saving its expensive ammunition for stronger foes). As to why it disappeared, it's a mix of tactical and technological reasons. As mentioned in other answers, in reality, actually getting into a position for an effective ram during a battle at sea was difficult and was almost as big a risk for the ship performing the ram as the target. This was realised fairly early on as noted by E.J.Reed (a British naval architect) in 1869 - 

Just as there were improvements in ship's armor, there were also improvements in ship's armaments. Technological improvements in mechanization, metalurgy and chemistry lead to bigger guns, firing larger, more destructive shells over greater ranges and at higher velocities. This meant that naval battles were fought at a distance and the pistol-shot pell-mell battles of the age of sail were a thing of the past. So in most cases warships simply didn't get close enough to ram each other and the designers realised that there was little point in adding a big chunk of metal to the bow that wouldn't get used. 

So it's a modified FV432 as you guessed. Apparently, some of them had a scorpion tank turret fitted (with dummy gun) as part of OPFOR exercises, presumably to look a bit like a Russian BMP. Others, as the quote suggests, used a turret taken from the Fox armoured cars (which had a 30mm Rarden cannon) and were deployed in Berlin in the 1960s. The PRP256D registration on the vehicle was issued in 1966, so could be original. According to this video from The Fifth Gear TV programme, this vehicle is actually two FV432s welded together (Listen at the two minute mark). The 30mm cannon has been removed leaving just the shortened barrel housing. 

By the time of George V, it was a long standing practice to name military honours after the place/event for which they were awarded. These honours conveyed no title to land and so there was no requirement for that land to be held by the British Crown. In the case of Naval awards, the location need not be on land. E.g. Baron Nelson of the Nile (who would probably have become Earl Nelson of Trafalgar had he lived). Where a military honour was awarded was made for general meritorious service, rather than a particular battle, the honour was often named after a British location (often the place of birth or residence of the person receiving the award). E.g. Edward Pellew became Baron Exmouth. 

It's not entirely clear whether the "compass" referred to in the passage, was a magnetic compass or a divider caliper. However, given that they had no charts, the latter would seem to be of little use. Also Bligh's log has regular entries on wind direction and direction of travel so the presence of a magnetic compass seems more likely. The quadrant was used to observe latitude and while longitude was taken 'by account' (i.e. by dead reckoning). 

So it would appear that while the chances of dying at sea were reduced in the later period, it would seem that's partly accounted for by removing the men from the navy before they could die. Skilled sailors were in equal demand by the merchant navy too and men frequently swapped between the two (voluntarily or otherwise). The increasing domination of the seas by the Royal Navy, meant that the British merchant navy was also the world's dominant merchant fleet. If we pick the same period as above, it grew from employing 38,710 in 1755 to 165,030 in 1812[4]. So even in the midst of a long war, the merchant fleet employed a considerably larger number of men than the navy. The merchant fleet also kept increasing in size post-war while the navy shrank considerably (in 1820 the merchant fleet employed 174,514 against the navy's 23,985). In fact, the navy workforce shrank by 75% in just two years. I would imagine that this post-war discharge of seamen had a far greater effect on ports and coastal towns than the few thousand extra men who were saved from scurvy. The merchant fleet absorbed some of this number but the rest would have to compete on the job market with everyone else. 1. The foundations of British Maritime Ascendancy, R. Morriss, p236-238 2.
