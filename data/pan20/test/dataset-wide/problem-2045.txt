Although I understand that you are engaging in a bit of name-dropping, it seems rather silly to me. I'm not sure how I'd feel as a hiring manager if I saw a famous name with no number attached to a resume. I suspect I'd feel you were playing games. Personally, I'd prefer to get the references only later in the process. That said, I suspect your approach isn't fatal to your job search, and may help in some circumstances. Anything is "OK", if you have the individual's permission. It's hard to say if it will be "effective" or not. 

Tread carefully here. When I read this, it comes across as "I don't want to work hard" or "I can't meet deadlines". I would avoid this as a reason for changing jobs. Do you really think your next job will never require any quick work or deadlines? 

Your best bet is probably to contact the hiring manager, and reiterate your desire for confidentiality. Something along the lines of "I see this memo was sent to all the department heads. While I was really excited to be a finalist, I do want to make sure that everyone, including these department heads and anyone else who is notified here, understands my desire that this remain confidential. I'm sure you can appreciate my position." might work. As I'm sure you understand, once more than a few people know something, it's hard to keep it quiet. So contact them soon. 

Yes, you can (and I believe should) use sentences without "I". In general, we know your resume is about you - there's no confusion. Your resume will look awkward littered with the word "I" in practically every sentence. $URL$ 

Hiring managers will want to know why you chose to be unemployed for 6-9 months. So you will need to explain. Most people in your position would work on personal projects in their own time while continuing work. Your approach will seem unusual to some potential employers. Likely hiring managers will want to understand why, if they hire you, they should expect you to stick around for a while and not choose to leave again in less than a year. Since you've done it once, they will think, you are more likely to do it again. When I was a hiring manager I always like to hire people who felt work was important. And honestly speaking, voluntarily choosing to become unemployed would make me less likely to hire you. It wouldn't be absolute, but it would be a red flag. Before you take this step, consider how this will look in your career progression. If this is your first job, leaving after less than a year to work on personal project might look like you don't really have a sense of where you are going. If this is just happening after a long-ish career, it might be a signal of boredom and potential employers might wonder where you will settle. And also consider seriously how you will get by financially during your unemployment. Some folks look unfavorably on those who "take time off" and voluntarily choose to be supported by others. In addition, it can sometimes take much longer to reenter the workforce than we might assume. I know some folks who were laid off and took over 2 years to find a good job. Last, be very careful that 6-9 months of "personal projects" doesn't just end up turning into a longer time of "doing little to nothing". I'm not writing this to discourage you, just to give you a perspective on how potential employers may see your actions. 

At the time you are asked to do work, write an e-mail confirming your assumption regarding what you are planning to do. At the end, include phrasing such as "Please let me know if my assumptions are incorrect." Send it to your supervisor and copy yourself. Save all these emails. Then, if questions come up, you can trace your work back to the requirements. 

No idea. I suppose you could ask a lot of hiring managers if they care, and then ask where they went to school. That might allow you to draw some sort of conclusions. 

In general, employers hire people who they expect to be around for a while. There are a few exceptions: 

This tells us that your coworker just has a minor habit when in the zone and perhaps under a bit of stress. Since it doesn't prevent you from getting your job done, it isn't your issue to deal with. 

I'm not sure I'd use the word "intuition" here. But assuming you are asking the equivalent of "How should I handle an employee who still doesn't 'get it' after 3 years of trying?" here's how I would answer. Assuming this lack is important, and assuming that you've already tried all remedial actions you can think of, I'd start the process of removing the employee. If there is another role for which she is qualified and might have a chance of "getting", then I'd offer the reassignment. Otherwise I'd start whatever PIP process you have and move her out of the company. Small companies in particular need everyone to contribute. If this worker isn't, then she would be better off elsewhere, and so would your company. I've had a few employees like that, and ended up letting them go. I would never let a problem like that linger for multiple years. But now you need to deal with what is in front of you. Note: union rules / local laws / etc - all of these might influence the actions you can and should take. You first need to decide what applies and what does not. 

The "software field" is so vast, I think one can easily predict that there will always be something in that field which needs doing and that companies are willing to pay for. It's easy to imagine a long and rewarding career in software. If you get into software, you should expect to spend your entire career attempting to stay relevant. The history of software is such that changes are rapid, and never-ending. What was important (and lucrative) a few years ago can easily be unimportant tomorrow. That said, globalization tends to commoditize pretty much everything ad everyone - particularly jobs that can be done remotely. Jobs that don't require face-to-face, physical coordination can easily be moved to a cheaper labor source. And the drive in business these days is to make as many software folks fungible as they can. If you want to be in software, you might wish to stay as flexible as possible, be ready to move to different aspects of software as needed, and spend a lot of time staying up on technology. 

I always put jobs in reverse-chronological order, with the end date as the primary key and the start date as the secondary key. I agree that your current order seems odd, and I suspect it would be confusing to the reader. 

Talk with your manager, and explain your dilemma. Suggest that you be given permission and time to enhance your utilities so that they are more robust, have a sufficient level of error handling, are well documented, and are well-tested on machines other than yours. Then, you could present the enhanced utilities to the team for their use. As @cbojar wisely suggests, if your team has an internal tools person or group - you could turn the finished product over to them for continued support. I was fortunate enough to have a terrific "toolsmith" on my last QA Team. He was a wiz at creating these sorts of tools, tips, and utilities. He shared your concerns, but I urged him share his work with the rest of the team. He eventually did - and everyone benefited. The team became more productive, and the toolsmith got a nicer bonus at the end of the year, and the appreciation of the team. You might find that your boss would welcome this approach. Or you might find that she/he would rather you not share. 

Anything that is very important to you means it is also very important to discuss during your interviews. If you require the ability to work from home when you desire, then bring it up during your discussions. Don't be hazy about it - make sure you explain specifically what you are looking for in enough detail that they understand what you are asking for, and you understand their stance on meeting your needs. If the potential employer decides that this request makes you "flaky, lazy, or uncommitted", then clearly that employer doesn't meet your needs and you wouldn't want to work for them anyway. You shouldn't be afraid of this happening. You want to know which employers can meet your needs before you are hired, not after. Asking for permission to decide when and when not to work from home likely means that the list of potential employers is smaller, but that's exactly what you need - a smaller list of employers who will be more willing to give you what is very important to you. It will almost certainly take you longer to get hired, but once hired you will hopefully be happier. It's perfectly appropriate to ask questions concerning the corporate culture during the interview process - probably after you get a sense that you are technically suited to the position, and the other aspects of the job are a good match. For example, I don't want to do any business travel any longer - it just doesn't fit into my life these days. Thus, sometime during the interview process I make sure I ask about the need for business travel. If I hear anything that leads me to believe that travel is expected, then I thank the interviewer for their time, but tell them that the needs of the position just don't match my personal needs. And then I move on to other companies. You could approach this question as "Tell me about your policy on working from home?" Then listen, and probe for understanding. Learn if you'll be able to take advantage of that while you are still a new employee or not. Learn how often it will be permissible to work from home (several days per week? only once per month?), and how much advance notice you must provide (if any). Then you will learn if both you and your employer will be happy with the situation, or not. 

You need to suppress this immediate desire - no good can come of it. Have you spoken to your boss about how to handle these sorts of customer issues? In general, "the customer is always right" (even when they aren't). Being defensive is unlikely to help things at all - try to be helpful instead. Put yourself in their shoes and imagine how it would feel to have the software you depend on to help with your event just fail completely. Remember that without happy customers, you don't have a job. Also remember that unless you own the company, you don't get to decide which customers can be discarded/dismissed. Try to brainstorm additional ways to debug their system. Perhaps once you solve their issues, you'll be able to show them that the problems had nothing to do with the software you wrote. If that happens, you'll have converted them from a negative, blaming client to a grateful, happy customer. That can pay off big time. Work with your boss to determine what to do next. Strategize ways to avoid or be able to quickly diagnose this problem so that it doesn't happen to another valuable customer. Ask you boss how you should react if a similar situation occurs in the future. You could rise above their negativity and be the hero here.
