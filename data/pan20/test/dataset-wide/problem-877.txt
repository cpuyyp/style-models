When planets are formed do only gas and ice giants accrete hydrogen and helium? Does this accretion have to be beyond the "snow line"? In other words, would all hydrogen or helium in the atmosphere of a super-earth come from outgassing (radioactive decay, etc)? 

Just for fun I did a limited analysis of Jupiter size planets found using radial velocity or astrometry (mostly the former) techniques with the following criteria: 1) Data from the on-line sources $URL$ and $URL$ giving planets discovered through Apr. 2016. 2) Msini: 0.5-10 M(J) 3) Distance to star less than 58 parsecs 4) Planets out to 5200 day periods (or 6AU) 5) Only data from K,G or F dwarfs on main sequence (V or IV/V). This was an attempt to minimize observational bias. I still found a pronounced peak in Jupiters with periods less than 50 days, but less pronounced if plotting against distance (sma). However, I also found peaks in numbers of Jupiters at slightly farther out than Earth and at a distance about the same as the beginning of the asteroid belt in the solar system.The Earth peak is much wider and goes away in the period histogram. This data is dominated by planets orbiting G stars 89 of 139 (107 of 171 planets). Interestingly (or not) there is a peak in Jupiters that are in "multiple Jupiter systems" around the orbit of Venus that "washes out" the Earth peak. The percenatage of "hot Jupiters" depends on definition, but 22 of 171 have period less than 50 days and 13 have orbits less than 0.1AU. If anyone is interested in more detail of my results please e-mail me. 

Try this link $URL$ . It's a good one and it's free. Do you see a triangle of bright stars looking up? If so they are probably Altair, Vega and Arcturus. You need to use longitude also. I guessed 80 deg. East. Here are the apparent brightnesses in magnitudes of the 3 stars above east to west: Altair +0.76, Vega +0.026 and Arcturus -0.05. Vega is slightly north of the other two. Therefore, I think your star is the brightest star in the northern hemisphere, Arcturus. 

From what I understand, the TRAPPIST 1 system was discovered using the transiting method looking at 20 ultra-cool small stars. I'm not sure how many have been observed since this study. What I wonder is, what would we expect to see if all 20 had planets? I'm not sure how many planetary systems in this and future similar studies we would expect to see edge on. What about radial velocity measurements? Did we just get lucky with TRAPPIST 1? 

I was extremely stoked when I read an article in January of this year that the Kepler2 mission found three Earth-sized objects (one possibly in the habitable zone) transiting a star only 150LY away. I haven't heard anything since, not even if this star and planets (confirmed) have been given a Kepler designation. I guess I would like to know if JWST or some other upcoming mission will be able to give us more info on this system. I can't imagine how excited I will be if TESS gives us something even closer!! 

Since the late heavy bombardment, the Earth's orbit couldn't have changed much. After all, life has been here ever since. Most scientists think that the answer to the faint young sun paradox is a thicker CO2 atmosphere and not the Earth being closer in. In earlier solar system history, the Earth may have been "shepherded" in by Jupiter when it migrated closer. 

This question has (in a sense) been asked before, but not adequately answered, so let me put it a different way. How far away could James Webb be from Earth and still detect biosignatues in its atmosphere from radiation transfer during a transit? Also, what would be the easiest lines to detect (ozone IR lines?)? How would this compare with the scrapped TPF mission and how would it vary with stellar type of the host star? 

I just found out the answer to my question from a live press release on You Tube that has been covered by blogs like this: $URL$ What LIGO does is tell you what is causing the gamma ray burst that can be studied different ways. The highly anticipated announcement I just watched explained that LIGO observed the neutron star merger (they're calling the event a kilonova). With the help of VIRGO, the area of the sky could be narrowed down better than previous LIGO detections. LIGO told us the masses of the bodies, the distance to the objects, how much mass was ejected and thus what the end product of the collision is expected to be. We have observed many gamma ray bursts and this one was not particularly bright, but LIGO told astronomers to check this one out and so it was being observed within a few hours. The electromagnetic spectrum of this event was collected and very broad lines were detected which are believed to be caused by heavy elements being ejected at near light speeds. By our knowledge of how often these "kilonovae" should happen and the volume of elements heavier than iron thought now to have been emitted (16 Earth masses was the number mentioned in the press release), it can be said that a majority of many of the heavy elements we see around us may have come from these events. 

Check out the on-line SIMBAD astronomical data base. You can even make separate lists based on criteria (like: list all of the stars between 10 and 20 parsecs (have to convert parallax to light years/ parsecs = 1/parallax (in arcsec/ 1 parsec = 3.262 LY) with class between G0 and G9 from 0 to +30 deg declination). It's pretty cool and shows numerous listings of distance values, brightness, metallicity, etc. complete with date of study and source. I just looked again and masses aren't listed (sorry). Masses aren't directly measured anyway (except in the case of binaries where we know the distance). Masses are essentially determined from the Hertzprung -Russell (mass/ luminosity) diagram and can be refined if we can determine age by looking at spectra. Back to Sol-Station or Wikipedia or I should say their references. 

The data from Kepler has taught us that there is a much larger number of "Neptune-class" planets out there than we previously thought. I wonder, however, if this "dominance" of Neptunes is because of the wide range of radii we use to define this class. If I'm not mistaken, we classify a planet as "Earth-like" when it is in the range 0.75 to 1.25 R(Earth), "Super-earth" from about 1.25 to 2.0 R(Earth) and "Neptune class" from 2.0 to 6.0 R(Earth) (a much larger range which would stand out even more if we knew masses). Are we maintaining the nomenclature to classify planets of different characteristics or are we just "solar system biased"? 

From what I have read including this and this and this, some models predict a layer of liquid water. The presence of water (liquid or ice) is predicted based on the density measurement of 2.1 g/cm3 which is a little more than Ganymede, Titan, and Callisto and considerably less than Europa. Early in Ceres history it's interior would have been hotter due to the residual heat from formation and decay of radioactive elements and there would have been a large amount of liquid water. As Ceres cooled with age by way of convection of heat to the surface and lessening radioactive decay, most or all of the subsurface liquid water would have frozen.There may still be a layer of liquid water due to some remaining interior heat and the mixing of materials such as ammonia in the water that would reduce the freezing temperature. As far as surface water vapor detection goes, there is a chance that there is some "cryovolcanism" (water volcanoes) on Ceres (like Enceladus and Europa), which would indicate subsurface water, but it is thought to be from ice sublimation on the surface similar to what happens on comets. According to one of the articles I read above, scientists believe that when Ceres is closest to the sun this sublimation occurs and when farther away it doesn't. 

I found one "hot Jupiter" in the Kepler data (Kepler 45b). The star is a M dwarf with an effective temperature of 3820K. The planet has an estimated mass of 160.5 M(Earth) and radius of 10.76 R(Earth). This gives a density of about 0.8 g/cm2 which is consistent. The planet is located at approximately 0.03 AU from the star with an orbital eccentricity of 0.11. Also, it may be interesting that the star has a very high metallicity of Fe/H = 0.28. (This data is from $URL$ ). It must be said, however, that M dwarfs only made up about 4.3% of the initial Kepler study which found 82 "Jupiter size" planets (as of my tally in April of 2015). Thus, there is an indication that there are less "hot Jupiters" around M dwarfs, but sample size is way too small. There does seem to be a correlation between stars hosting "hot Jupiters" and their metallicity (more common around higher Fe/H stars). My gut feeling is that "hot Jupiters" in general are uncommon. They are just the easiest thing to find. 

I am interested in a sun-like star 138 light years away that is in the EUVE catalog. A table shows that a photon count of 2.6+/-0.5 photons per kilosecond at 100 angstroms has been detected for this star. I can not determine if this is high or not. I am even having a hard time finding what solar emission is at this wavelength so i can attempt the math to compare with the sun. Can somebody help me here? 

Let's imagine a moon orbiting a planet at 75000km distance (assume circular orbit). Now let's say that the Hill Sphere of this planet only extends to 78,000km (small planet in the habitable zone of a small star). As with the moon/Earth situation, this moon is slowly drifting farther away from the planet. (ie Deimos and Mars). What factors effect the time frame of this moon being lost so that it would be in orbit of the star and not the planet. Does anybody know of a computer simulation showing this happen? Wondering what the trajectory and duration of the transition period would look like. 

I have read about and heard about the theory that most of the heavy elements we have here on Earth came from colliding neutron stars rather than by way of supernovae. I'm not sure how strong this theory is, but I wonder if a LIGO (and backup observational/ gamma ray) detection would help answer this question in any way. 

I found this article $URL$ from 2011 announcing that two dozen secondary eclipses of "hot Jupters" have been seen in Kepler data. I even think I have seen a light curve showing phase changes of a transiting planet. This makes me think that there should be evidence in the Kepler data for non-transiting planets since the amplitude of the light curve due to planetary phase changes shouldn't be much different from that of a secondary eclipse as long as there is a fairly high inclination (say over 60 degrees). Is anybody aware of such an examination of the data? 

Here's some pertinent facts: Apparent magnitudes: Sun from Ganymede = -23.11 Jupiter from Ganymede = -16.02 (full) Difference = - 7.09 Brightness difference = 2.512 E7.09 = 686 times brighter Earth comparison: Sun from Earth = -26.74 Moon from Earth = -12.74 (mean full) Full moon/ Jupiter from Ganymede difference = 20.5 times Ganymede facts: Orbital period = 1 Ganymede day: 7.16 days Orbital inclinations: .2 deg to Jupiter equator 2.2 deg to ecliptic Orbital eccentricity: .0011 (circular) Orbital speed (ave.): 10.88 km/s Jupiter facts: Mean radius: about 70000 km Summary: If you are on the "far side" of Ganymede you won't see Jupiter (maybe a glow on the horizon from Ganymede's thin atmosphere). The sun will be 2.512 E3.63 = about 28 times dimmer than seen from Earth (which is still pretty darn bright). A day will last 7.16 Earth days. The near side will be far more interesting. The sun will go through the same cycle at the same brightness as on the far side. However, Jupiter will "hover" in the sky (maybe a little wobble/ libration) and when full will be about 686 times dimmer than the sun in the sky. Jupiter will go through phases over the course of the 7.16 day cycle and be less bright of course as it approaches eclipse. The eclipse (by rough calculations) will last about three and a half hours. The planet will have an angular diameter of about 7.5 degrees (compare with 0.5 for sun/moon from Earth) and be about 20.5 times brighter than a full moon when Ganymede is between the sun and Jupiter. A fun side note is that the sky won't be totally dark during eclipse. Light from the sun will reflect off aerosols and hazes in Jupiter's upper atmosphere making Jupiter "glow" in Ganymede's sky.
