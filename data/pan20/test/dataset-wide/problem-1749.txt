Try clonezilla live cd. You can boot into a live session and image your machine without having to install anything. You then have the option to store the copy of the image on a network share or remote machine and so on. 

I need to create a rule that stops certain groups from sending email to the entire corporate office distribution group. However I need to be able to let them send email to individual members of said distribution group. Is there a way to do so without having to allow each individual mailbox in the rule? I realize that would work but it would take a long time, also I realize that I could make another distribution group but I need to complete this ASAP. So for now I am looking for a workaround. Any suggestions??? 

I have searched through SF and could not really find what I was looking for. My question is this: I have a network containing of 50 remote locations that all connect over a MPLS network. I am needing to update all of the workstations. I am currently using WSUS SP 3 to deploy updates to the head office. There is a total of about 1000 workstations. Can my current WSUS server handle updating this many locations or do I need to move to SCCM? All locations connect to us over a T1 circuit. 

What type of VPN? I assume probably over PPTP if so then Mac OS X has a built in PPTP client. You can find more info here Mac OS X PPTP

You can perform a carrier busy test to check the radio activity on bridge channels. In privileged EXEC mode, enter this command to perform a carrier busy test: dot11 interface-number carrier busy Use the show dot11 carrier busy command to re-display the carrier busy test results. 

I like Parted Magic it is a live linux distro that uses the gparted partition editor. Very nice if you like GUI's 

I have been searching for a solution to deploy group policy to Windows Mobile Devices. So far I have came up with nothing other that "Microsoft System Center Mobile Device Manager". Has anyone else came across this issue? If so what did you use, If there is nothing else then I will use the previously mentioned solution but I hate to deploy a new server just for this reason. *Note: These are not used for phone capabilities they will only be used as a pocket pc. 

What do we need to do to make the disks be recognized? Any other things that we need to try? EDIT Here is the output of : 

If the name for the reverse address does not match the forward address, it is likely that the name you see was the name assigned to your IP address when the IP was used by a different customer of your provider. If the name does match, you should talk to your provider and make sure something else isn't going on. If possible, please revise your question with some examples of what you're seeing. 

We are looking into using BtrFS on an array of SSD disks and I have been asked to verify that BtrFS does in fact perform TRIM operations upon deleting a file. So far I have been unable to verify that the TRIM command is sent to the disks. I know BtrFS is not considered production ready, but we like the bleeding edge, therefore I'm testing it. The server is Ubuntu 11.04 server 64-bit release (mkfs.btrfs version 0.19). I have installed the Linux 3.0.0 kernel as the BtrFS changelog states that bulk TRIM is not available in the kernel shipped with Ubuntu 11.04 (2.6.38). Here's my testing methodology (initially adopted from $URL$ with modifications to work with BtrFS): 

I strongly recommend against having Apache run as any real user. If an exploit is found in your sites, a malicious user can read or alter your personal files. WordPress will run fine with the files being owned by your user account and with Apache running as a different user. There are a few files and paths which you should to the same group as the Apache server and make group writable. That way Apache can make the necessary changes without the risk of a user having full access to the rest of your files. You should read the WordPress document on Changing File Permissions. 

At this point, the pre-delete and post delete verifications still show the same disk blocks in use. I should instead see a reduction in the number of in use blocks. Waiting an hour (in case it takes a while for the TRIM command to be issued) after the test file is deleted still shows the same blocks in use. I have also tried mounting with the options, but that doesn't seem to help at all. Partition that was created from above (I keep the partition small so the verification can go faster): 

Basically you need to include all directories in the search, then add all files to the list, the exclude all other files. The option is handy to use as it excludes any directory that doesn't have a file. 

There are definitely more advantages and disadvantages than I have listed, but those are the ones that come to mind quickly. At work, we use instance store for all instances unless there's a very specific reason for having an EBS instance. All EBS instances are duplicated in every available availability zone within a region to help ensure some instances continue running in the event of another EBS outage. I like to draw the line at customization: if an instance needs a lot of custom work to function, then use EBS, but if not, use instance store. I define custom work as tasks that need to be done by hand and are not automated. We use Puppet to deploy instances from scratch using the stock Ubuntu AMIs. I wrote a blog post about how we are able to take generic AMIs and place them in service without user intervention. If you're going to use AutoScaling or similar technology, I highly recommend investing in automation, even if you will roll your own AMI, as there will likely be changes you'll need between AMI builds (code deployments, etc). Regarding building instance store AMIs, there are a large number of tutorials available online showing how to build instance store AMIs, as instance store has been around a few years longer than EBS. The AMI tools are available at $URL$ . 

You'll gain much more control that way as opposed to using a package manager. Different applications on the same host can use different version of the JRE if they so prefer. 

You may not like this answer but I've never understood the benefit of installing Java via a package manager. After all the JRE (or the JDK for that matter) is simply a compressed archive before it is installed. Here are the simple steps to install without using a package manager: 

I believe you are going about this the wrong way. A user should always authenticate as himself. You should never allow user accounts where many people have the password. In particular on Solaris (I would say moreso than compared to Linux and Windows) there are multiple ways to avoid this. At our site we have our Solaris boxes integrated with AD so people log into Solaris as themselves (i.e. as their Windows identity). However once inside you'll often see them -ing into a role, e.g. . Even if they have su'ed to something else we can always track what their ultimate identity is. If you are not familiar with the concept of roles on Solaris then now is the time to familiarize yourself. 

I'm on the same device all the time. When I call the internal help desk the answer is to wait. "Just wait 10-15 minutes and you'll be able to connect back to your original session.". This is actually true, but I do not have time to wait 10-15 minutes every time this happens. Question: What is it in Citrix AppGate that makes it confused so that I cannot re-connect initially? Why is it helps to wait 10-15 minutes? How does it decide that this is an attempt for a new session, rather an attempt for a re-connect to an existing session? (Side note: everybody here seems to accept that this is just the way software works, but I for one really doubt that Citrix deliberately designs software this poorly. I'm very frustrated :-)) 

Unpack into where you want it. (e.g. ) or whatever If you have multiple JREs installed under that location then create symlinks, e.g. would point to your preferred JRE 7 version, etc. 

I'm working at a site that ask me to connect to certain in-house systems via Citrix AppGate over public internet. Sometimes it happens that I get disconnected from the session and when I try to reconnect I get this message: 

When going in the direction from Solaris --> Linux it is generally okay to create with Sun's tar and then extract with Linux tar (aka GNU tar). This is because GNU tar is a superset of Sun's tar. But to be safe you should really make it a habit to always to use GNU Tar on Solaris, in particular if you are unpacking something that originates from another platform, say Linux. (meaning going in the opposite direction) GNU Tar is installed by default in Solaris 10 and later. On Solaris 10 you'll find it in . Personally I've made it a habit to always use the command on Solaris in favor of the command. Then you don't have to think about it. 

When you do a reverse lookup of your IP address, does the name that is returned resolve back to your IP when looked up as a forward address? For example: 

From reading your answer it sounds like this is a client-side issue. Subversion does not support client-side hooks (from what I know) so I would recommend writing a small script similar to the following to perform your update and also update the revision number in a file. 

It appears that the first and last sectors of the file are within a different erase blocks from the rest of the file. Therefore some sectors were left untouched. A takeaway form this: some Ext4 TRIM testing instructions ask the user to only verify that the first sector was TRIM'd from the file. The tester should view a larger portion of the test file to really see if the TRIM was successful or not. Now to figure out why manually issued TRIM commands sent to the SSD through the RAID card work but automatic TRIM commands to not... 

Rsync can be confusing about selective copies like this. I use the following to do the task that you're asking for: 

You may need to talk to you AD administrator to set up a service account for Apache to use to connect to AD (if your AD requires you to bind before performing a search). If you wish to allow anonymous reads while requiring users to authenticate to write, replace the line above with the following: 

I recently had a similar problem on a Debian Lenny box that was set to UTC when I wanted localtime. First you need to copy (or symlink) your correct zoneinfo file from to . For example I ran on my system. Second you need to edit to reflect your timezone as well. On my system, the file states . Once both of those files are taken care of, it is a good idea to restart crond to ensure the proper timezone is picked up. 

After many failed attempts at verifying BtrFS on the server, I decided to try this same test using an old laptop (remove the RAID card layer). The initial attempts of this test using both Ext4 and BtrFS on the laptop fail (data not TRIM'd). I then upgraded the SSD drive firmware from version 0001 (as shipped out of the box) to version 0009. The tests were repeated with Ext4 and BtrFS and both filesystems successfully TRIM'd the data. To ensure the TRIM command had time to run, I did a before performing validation. One thing to note if you're attempting this same test: SSDs have erase blocks that they operate on (I don't know the size of the Crucial m4 erase blocks). When the file system sends the TRIM command to the drive, the drive will only erase a complete block; if the TRIM command is specified for a portion of a block, that block will not be TRIM'd due to the remaining valid data within the erase block. So to demonstrate what I'm talking about (output of the script above). This is with the test file on the SSD. Periods are sectors that only contain zeros. Pluses have one or more non-zero bytes. Test file on drive:
