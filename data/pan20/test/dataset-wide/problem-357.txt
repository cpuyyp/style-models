Now, point X and point Y are equidistant from the sun at all points of the year. There are no longer any seasons. 

First and foremost, everyone would not be infected, let alone die. Look at Brazil and Peru and the tribes of the Amazon, many of whom still haven't been contacted. Since they have no human contact, they won't get non-airborne diseases from outside. Since you say it is fluid-borne, they won't be affected. This can also be demonstrated by the fact that when new tribes are contacted, two-thirds of them die out within the year (Tribes of the Amazon documentary, BBC Four). This is because they have not had any diseases from outside, so are not immune to them. 

It takes 1000-1250 foot-pounds (1350-1700 Newton-metres) of torque to break a human neck. That kind of force is generally achieved in a 5-9 foot drop. You can also work out exactly how far you need to drop someone of mass $x$ to break their neck: $$ d = \frac{1}{g}\cdot\frac{T}{x} = \frac{T}{gx} $$ That is, the required drop distance (in metres) is equal to the torque required to break their neck (assume $1700 \text{ Nm}$) divided by the gravitational field strength (assume $9.81 \text{ N}\cdot\text{kg}^{-1}$ on Earth) multiplied by the person's mass, $x \text{ kg}$. The higher the mass, the smaller the distance required. So that's one way a human can break another's neck: drop them out of a first-floor window onto their head. The torque from the impact will snap their neck. The same can be said of any impact: if you hit hard enough, their neck will break. We can use the formula above to find a figure for force. Assuming an average person of around 85 kilograms, you need $\frac{T}{d} = gx$ Newtons of force: $$ gx = 9.81 \times 85 = 833.85 \text{ N} $$ You can use this figure to construct an impact that will have the required force to break a human neck. Using the fact that in an impact, impulse $Ft$ is equal to the change in momentum $x\Delta v$: $$ Ft = x\Delta v $$ $$ \frac{Ft}{x} = \Delta v $$ Assuming a stopping time of around 0.1 seconds (typical of many impacts), we can work out the required delta-V: $$ \Delta v = \frac{833.85 \times 0.1}{85} = 0.981 $$ So, you need an impact with a deceleration of $9.81 \text{ms}^{-2}$ to break a neck. Not surprising, given that the dropping method is, essentially, exactly that impact. You can, of course, use the force figure to work out any number of other creative ways to break your target's neck. 

Assuming your guns do actually have recoil, and you're not just using a big recoilless cannon: Inertial Dampening A number of space games use a technology they call "inertial dampeners". Essentially, these are sensors linked up to the engine controls. If the throttle isn't being held, they act to slow the ship down much as friction would on a road on Earth. You can calculate how much force you need to do this, if you know the mass of the projectile you're firing and how fast it's going - the forward momentum of the projectile is equal to the backward momentum of the ship. With the backward momentum of the ship, you can calculate the force you need to stop it moving. Upgrades You say you're planning to offer this as an upgrade to your players. Great idea. How about taking that one step further with an upgrade path that looks something like: 

Emphasis mine. Precipitation is emphasised because it can come in the form of either rain or snow. Deserts that mainly get rain are hot deserts, deserts that mainly receive snow are cold deserts. Another defining factor for a desert is temperature swings. Because the air in a desert is so dry, there is nothing to hang onto the heat it receives in the day, so the temperature drop is quite large. 

If these devices can be manufactured and run cheaply, they will quickly become fairly standard in building and vehicle design. The use of the air allows much more space for driving around in - just make sure you limit altitude so people can't crash into planes. That said, flying cars might even make the aerospace industry fairly obsolete. The speed of integration of these devices will vary fairly linearly with their costs: high costs = slow integration; low costs = fast integration. It also depends, as the comments say, on area of effect: a large area of effect means you need fewer devices to cover a bigger area, thus reducing total cost and speeding up integration. However, society, as always, plays a big role in the speed of acceptance of these devices. As with any technological revolution, there are naysayers and yaysayers, and while I don't want to rigidly stereotype, the acceptance is often affected by age. The older generation are more likely to cling to what they've always known; the younger, more inquisitive generation are more likely to want to try this out as soon as possible. You can see examples of this in many new technologies: in my personal experience, I adapt to new technologies and developments quickly, while my parents and older family are happy with how things are. 

Sign language is in itself an analogy; it's an analogy of actions. It maps what humans do to a sign representing that action closely enough to be understood; this is then standardised with the introduction of a formal sign language. The relationship between sign and natural language is vague enough that you can safely discount it when trying to create a sign language. As the first point here says, sign language is about actions. Sign language seems too close to our natural languages to be useful without a natural language because you automatically associate the actions in sign language with the action you'd take, and then the word for that action. If such a species doesn't have natural languages and therefore words, they'd just associate the action in sign language with the action they'd take, and not go on to associate the word. In a sense, for this species, actions would be the form of communication. A sign language of another civilisation would, therefore, be formed similarly to our sign languages. How does this civilisation act in certain scenarios? What do they do? Take those actions - such as eating - and form a sign for them. There are a number of other questions around the site about forming a language; you can also use the advice in those to record your language and use it again later. 

The prefix extra- is generally used for things that are outside of normality - for example, extraterrestrial for being outside Earth-normal, or extracurricular for education outside of the normal curriculum. Let's apply this to humans. If you're sort-of human, but not the original design, you could be known as extrahuman. From here, you can take a major point from each of the levels of extrahumanity that you intend to create (5 of them, in your case), and prepend that to the general class name to come up with a specific name. Your #1 could be digital extrahumans. Your #2 has a theme of meta-existence, so perhaps they're meta extrahuman. Your #3 doesn't have an obvious theme, but if there's something specific you're using, like a Vulcan faction - try Vulcan extrahumans on for size. At #4 you're really moving out of the realm of humanity, so perhaps you need to change the base name entirely. What about superhumans, to take a clich√©'d term literally? And #5 you've already decided on, but try adding the previous name to form transcendent superhumans.
