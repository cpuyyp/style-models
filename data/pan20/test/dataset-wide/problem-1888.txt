This space is not yours to rent. That seems clearly indicated by "I checked the company handbook and there is nothing in there about the assigned parking spots other than not to park in someone else's". If you rented it to someone, they would be parking in someone else's space. Relying on the fact that the company handbook doesn't say that you cannot rent out assigned spots is rather silly. It also doesn't say that you cannot pitch a tent in that spot and live there. It also doesn't say that you cannot paint the spot in your favorite colors. It doesn't say that you can dig out the spot and turn it into a barbecue pit. Lots of things are omitted from handbooks. Those omissions don't give you blanket permission for everything else. I'm sure you already know that. But if you ask permission first, and then follow the company's guidance, it will be ethical and will not be problematic. Any other route could lead to both ethical issues and/or problems for you at work. Alternatively, you could ask the company to give you the parking benefit in cash (presumably whatever it costs them to actually provide the spot). Or, you could ask that they pay your bus fares instead of giving you the spot. 

You should say nothing about the time gaps unless asked or it is otherwise necessary to account for that time, or unless you need to ask for special accommodations due to your condition. Even then, only explain as much as is necessary for the interview. Often you just need to acknowledge that there is a real gap, that it isn't a typo, and that you had something you needed to deal with. You might need to convey that you weren't just sitting around without a job for no reason. Most employers won't care at all about the details of your medical condition, but some might need to be reassured that it is something which is in the past (if that's truly the case). Again, no need to recount any painful details - just enough to answer the questions being asked. 

Any or all of these things will reduce the need to ask for more work, and will certainly avoid having to ask every half-hour to an hour. 

You are in very high demand, but still have been unable to land a job. That says that you are doing something wrong. Perhaps your exhaustion is the root cause here. But you should take a long hard look and see if there's something else going on. Check your resume, your cover letter. Think over your interview skills and perhaps practice with a friend. Make sure you are applying for the right jobs - jobs that fit your skills and experience level. 

Definitely. Any leave of absence should be documented. And all the terms of that leave should be clear to you, and to the company. You can try, but you may not get exactly what you are looking for. Companies that grant leaves often leave themselves the right to stop holding a position open, if business conditions change sufficiently, if you don't return according to schedule, etc, etc. If they agree to leave, they will certainly spell out the details of how it will work. 

You can press your boss to address your review now, rather than waiting until the buy out occurs. This may or may not be successful. It's quite possible that the buy-out process requires a stop to all reviews and raises, and your manager might not have any power to change that. That would not be unusual. If you discuss this with your manager, and point out how you view this as unfair, you'll likely get a response that at least clarifies what he can and cannot do at this time. That way you'll know with a bit more certainty. At worst, you'll be able to decide if you want to stick around and wait for a raise, or move on. Acquisitions change everything. Unfortunately, while your situation may feel unfair, it isn't that unusual. 

There's little to no added cost for an additional line on an email. So the "added cost to the planet" is probably not greater. That said, I think the biggest benefit to adding this phrase accrues to the sender - making her/him feel better about themselves. I doubt this phrase actually convinces anyone to avoid printing the email who would otherwise print it. 

Large companies often have a central database of applicants. This database may indeed be accessed by subsidiaries and partner companies for background checks. In the US, this is perfectly legal and pretty much standard practice. 

Certainly an alternative is to just do the work that is assigned to you, without regard to if it happens to be "inconvenient". You cannot just say "Hey boss, you should pick and choose your battles". There's nothing diplomatic about that - just the opposite. If you can get yourself in check a bit, and in a calm time period have a quiet, private chat with your manager, you might be able to explain your viewpoint on some of the specifics. Focus on why you feel a change would be ineffective, not that it is "inconvenient" or that you don't feel a request is "acceptable" - that's not for you to decide. While software engineering might be in high demand in your locale, anyone can be replaced. When a company brings in a new manager, there is always some change. Often, that's the reason this new manager was chosen - to enact change. If you can't bring yourself to do what the new boss wants, you may be best advised to once again find yourself a new job. Otherwise, the choice may not be yours to make. That said, your question makes it sound like you really don't care at all. It reads as if you have already decided "If things aren't exactly the way I want, I'll risk getting fired or I'll quit - because I'm in such high demand that I can get a new job in a few days." Perhaps you have been lucky, and usually your manager does everything you want, and only requests things that are convenient to you. In my experience, that isn't typical, but your mileage may vary. In my experience, most managers will only deal with high-maintenance individuals for a short period of time before concluding that they aren't worth it and dumping them. Maybe in the long run you aren't suited to work for someone else. You might be better off working for yourself, and never having to do anything you don't necessarily agree with. 

This leads me to believe that you haven't already asked your former manager that you would be using her as a reference. That is a huge mistake! Whenever you use someone as a reference - ask their permission first, because you want to make sure you choose people who will give you a great reference. A surprised reference may not be ready to convey your best side to your new employer. A surprised reference may become angry, think you lied, and give less-than-flattering responses to questions being asked. You would be far better served to ask your manager ahead of time, prepare her for who will be calling, and try to lay the foundation for a great reference. Anything else is far too risky. 

You received 4 extra unexpected paychecks worth of funds that you weren't entitled to. The money must be somewhere that it wasn't planned to be. 

Yes, it's appropriate. Any time you are offered what is essentially a new job, I think you are entitled to learn about all the components of that job, before accepting that offer. To me, compensation changes, currency, relocation assistance, training, etc - these are all completely relevant. 

There's always a possibility of being hired - it only takes one willing employer! It seems like you have several options at your disposal: 

Yes, send your thanks to everyone you met. Use customized individual letters (or customized individual emails, if you prefer). The point of a thank you letter is usually to get yourself a bit more attention from the hiring company. Thanking everyone individually gives you a chance to highlight something discussed with that individual, and hopefully make an even better impression. Think of something, some special connection, that you can convey to each individual separately. Show them that you are willing to put some effort into things, rather than just tossing off a "Thanks" email and copying everyone. A good job is worth some effort. You never know which individual might put in a good word that is the tipping point leading to your hire - thank them all, and make it feel personal. 

No. Be ready to talk about books that have most impacted your studies. Be ready to talk about which you liked, which you didn't, and why it will help you be better at your profession. Be ready to talk about what you learned from your studies and readings, should it come up during an interview. But listing on your resume "the books and articles I have read" and "how many exercises I completed", won't show much maturity. Leave that off. 

You should have asked about a raise when you were informed of your promotion. Since that apparently didn't happen, and since you are still a few months away from this change, you should simply bring it up in your weekly one-on-one meeting with your boss (assuming you have one). If you don't regularly meet, ask for a time when you can meet. Discuss more of the specifics of your new position - the duties and responsibilities, exactly when it should take effect, how it will be announced to the rest of the team, etc. Then just ask if you can expect a raise along with the promotion. No need to be shy about it. You might learn that you will get a raise as soon as the promotion takes effect, and how much the raise will be. You might learn that you won't get a raise. Or you might learn that a raise will follow somewhere down the road. 

The answer is obvious - find a position where your advanced degree is worth more money. It won't be easy. Sometimes startups use the credentials of their employees to aid in their search for additional funding. That happened with me once. You said "I thought the advanced degree would improve my pay." What led you to believe that? Have you worked before, or are you a new graduate? In general, experience trumps degrees. But sometimes, everything else being equal, a degree can help. 

It makes no sense for you to bring alcohol to an interview. Similarly, it makes no sense for an interviewer to bring alcohol. 

Have you had a private conversation with your HR rep yet? If not, you should. They are trained in assessing and dealing with these situations. They can advise you on how you can personally deal with them, and can take further actions if warranted. 

Of course, you can make any case you like. I've never seen this happen in all the years I've worked. But perhaps your company does this sort of thing all the time. You won't know unless you ask. 

Yes. Any lies can be a deal breaker. If the company finds out during the interview/screening process they could simply refuse to hire you. Or, they could ask for an explanation and then decide if they wish to hire you or not. If the company finds out after hiring you, it usually can be grounds for immediate dismissal. There were probably words to that effect on the job application. Though not as common, lies discovered later serve as an indicator that you are not trustworthy. Companies want to be able to trust their employees. It's always best to be honest up front, then you wouldn't have these worries. At this point you can choose to remain silent and hope for the best. Or you can be proactive and talk to HR to correct your "mistakes", and hope for the best. We all make mistakes. Learn from it and move on. 

Of course. But why would you renew the contract only to leave 3 weeks later? That doesn't make much sense, and of course the company might be unhappy with that. If you want a great reference, don't do that. If you don't care about the burned bridges or references, you get to choose what you want to do. 

In many companies, interviews are performed in a layered manner. When I hire people, I do a phone screen first. I narrow the list down to a handful of candidates, and then I bring them all onsite. I am always the first person a candidate talks to once onsite. I talk with the candidate for at least 1/2 hour. If I conclude that the candidate isn't worth a further look, I'll thank them for their time and walk them out at that point. This doesn't happen often, since I've already spoken with them during the phone screen, but it does happen. If the candidate is worth a further look, I'll then have them talk with others on the team and outside the team that will ask far more technical questions. While I usually try to conduct all on-site interviews in the same session, some companies separate out the initial sessions and technical sessions. It's possible that you never reached the sessions in your interviews where the hiring company felt it was important to delve into your technical background in detail. Without knowing all of the specifics, there's no way to determine why you were rejected. Clearly the hiring company felt like you weren't a good fit - but there are many, many possible reasons. It could be communication ability, the way you talk about yourself, the salary you are seeking, or anything that comes across in person that isn't apparent in your resume. It's also possible that you were simply caught in an interview process that was bad to begin with - the company is poor at interviewing. Additionally, some companies believe that the non-technical aspects of the candidate are most important, and don't feel the need to dig in on the technical background as much. Unfortunately, there's no good way to know ahead of time how the interview will go. You just have to spend time and work hard at the interviews to land a good job. 

Not for me. I tend to carry the laptop to many meetings. I used to have a docking station but don't bother any more. It seems just fine to me. But ergonomics aren't one-size-fits-all. Some folks like the portability of laptops, but hate the keyboard, for example. They may be willing to tolerate the limitations of the screen size for short durations, but prefer a large screen for extended viewing. Etc, etc. If the thought of a laptop appeals to you, request it over a desktop. Then, after using it for a few months, ask for additional accessories only if needed. 

In my experience, recruiters and hiring managers alike would see a red flag raised with any break in your work history. It's not always logical, but the thought is "Why wasn't this person working? Is there something wrong here?" This can happen after a layoff. We all know of people who are laid off and immediately launch into a full-scale attack on the job market, working intensely to find their next position, and shorten their time off as much as possible. And we all know of people who use a layoff as an excuse to take it easy for a while, as they collect unemployment checks. Recruiters and hiring managers often welcome the first group, and discount the second group. If you take yourself out of the job market in order to beef up you skills for a career change, you risk being lumped in with the "taking time off people" - fairly or unfairly. You also raise the possibility in the hiring manager's mind that you may be the kind of person who will never be happy for long. That, basically you'll do to them what you are thinking about doing to your current employer. Again, this may be fair or unfair, but it's a real reaction for some hiring managers. And you also risk raising the question about your ability to learn new things. In many jobs, learning is an ongoing process. If you can't learn what you need for your career change while working at your current job, perhaps you can't learn within your next job (or, so the thinking goes). And even if you can sustain yourself for a year without income, there will come a time (sooner or later) when you start to feel stressed. That might not happen for a year, or it might happen in a month, everyone reacts differently. (I know that at many points in my career I would have been stressed with any amount of time at all when I wasn't on a payroll). Either way, you won't raise any flags at all by taking the time to learn what you need for your next career while still working at your current position. If you quit your current job first, you may not raise any red flags, but then again you may. Tough choices, but that's the real world (at least as I see it). Good luck!
