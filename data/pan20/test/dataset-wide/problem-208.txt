Give them a super good river You're a benevolent God, so give your people a nice, reliable, tamable river. I'm not sure what is irrigating your farmlands, but I'm going to argue that a river naturally will get people to move and explore. 

This means, that as people spread out along the river and travel up and down it and more importantly down the river, you're eventually going to end up at a sea or lake or ocean. Then, everything that made the river so appealing to follow will be cranked up to overdrive as people move up and down the shore in both directions, and eventually people would be so interested in what is beyond the sea/lake/ocean that they build big honking ships to go and try to see what's on the other side. If this whole scenario super plausible that's because this is exactly how early civilizations evolved and expanded. 

A river will make people want to spread out, gradually extending out the civilization and causing them to build towns and hamlets farther and farther away from the main city. Here's some reasons why: Fish Fish are a great source of protein. Fish guts are a great source of nitrates which can improve crop yields or reduce the amount of time a field must lie fallow between usages. Fishers would gradually spread out over the length of the river to try to find different pockets of fish or just to go upstream of a popular spot that is being overfished. Farmland A good river deposits nutrient-rich silt and irrigates the landscape, meaning that all up and down its banks would be super fertile, especially compared to the surrounding landscape. Nearby animals would come and graze on the grass growing near the river, as well as drink there, meaning the river banks would become great spots for hunting, too. Any enterprising farmer would want to settle away from the rest of the other farms to try to get more good land to till. Washing, Water and Waste I assume your city has people who wear clothes, get thirsty, and use the bathroom. The river will naturally be a super convenient place to dump your trash and, you know, take a dump. I'm sure some of your more well off citizens would want upstream water so that it doesn't taste so... earthy, or to wash their clothes where they know their neighbors don't dump their garbage. This means that more downstream city folks might find themselves more vulnerable to cholera, or in general get a dirtier river, causing more wealthier folks to try to move upstream. Trade Eventually, people in the one area of the city are going to realize it's really easy to move heavy objects if you put them on a raft than dragging it along by yourself. This will mean there will be warehouses and markets on the banks of the river. Merchants will associate the river with more trade and more wealth. People will build up their houses around these markets, and then it comes to pass that the only way to really expand your business is to build up more river docks. This and the waste problem will cause people to: Riverfront Spreading It's a treat to be able to have riverfront property. The views are nicer, you get better breezes, quicker access to water, your own little private quay. People will grab property on the riverfront, and as your city develops, more and more people will have to build farther and farther up and down the river to grab that good riverfront property. 

You have something going for these aliens in that they can see, if they and your humans can see the same things, then they can ask each other what things are by pointing at the unknown. Being able to read a point would be a plus, but it's not guaranteed unless your sophonts exist in groups where they have to direct each other (some dogs can learn to follow a point, chimpanzees have trouble with the concept). Your basic case for mutual language should probably be looking at Helen Keller. Helen Keller was 19 months old when she had an illness that left her deaf and blind. Originally, they were trying to teach her words by spelling them onto the palm of her hand, but since she had no knowledge of what the symbols meant they obviously didn't stick. The key breakthrough in Helen's learning came when her teacher spelled the word 'water' on her palm while pouring water over her hand. Apparently, that was the one word Helen has started to learn as baby, so with that one connection made, that the spelling of w-a-t-e-r meant 'cool, textureless, flavorless liquid that I can drink' she could then separate what was written on her palm as "water" or something else. But that first word bridge was the key. This is where being able to point might help, your aliens can see. Your humans can point to water, or pour a cup of the stuff over their hands and sign water. The aliens can then reciprocate with their sign for water and a mutual vocabulary can be built up, in sort of a meeting-half-way fashion. The human offering their own sign, the aliens giving theirs, the human or alien trying to mimic the simpler sign. (This can then be tested by setting out several objects, signing for one and having the other party then gesture to the object. You can then have perceptual fun by throwing complexity layers at it, what is more water a puddle on a table or water in a cup? If the addition of 'cup' changes the meaning of 'water' the alien will point at the puddle. A human might hand you the cup, as the puddle is not water, exactly, but is a wet table.) 

Clouds Different types of clouds sit on different layers based on altitude, air pressure, and relative humidity. You mentioned your atmosphere has breathable air, does it also have water vapor in the atmosphere? Are there rain clouds? Methane clouds? Sulfur Dioxide clouds? Maybe an enterprising character notices that the moisture collectors are collecting more methane than before, or that when they head into a storm cloud, they get more violent turbulence than before. Depending on how far up they are, maybe they are used to riding out some of the more violent storms that happened lower in the atmosphere, but the protagonists have a rude awakening when a storm that they previously wouldn't have paid mind to 10 years ago tragically destroys their town. 

Servals are solitary creatures that are highly territorial. Usually that means they make poor targets for human hunting companions (they much prefer to hunt on their own). Contrast this with dogs, who were most likely bred from wolves, who are pack animals. Check out this video for explanations on traits that make animals more domesticable. Servals have a short lifespan (compared to humans), reach maturity fairly quickly, and are fairly intelligent (all traits that are helpful with domestication). There is no reason why they wouldn't be useful in vermin patrol, setting up shop near fields and grain stores to protect them from being eaten by rodents. That's how modern cats were domesticated. This means that servals are probably able to be domesticated but would not do well as a hunting companion. 

A river will also make people move downstream, eventually leading people to an ocean, lake, or sea. Here are some reasons why: Floods There will naturally be periods of heavy rainfall, and since lots of people have their houses built on the river (some of them perhaps less well off than others), naturally some of these buildings would be swept away in floods. Since floods cause things to go, you know, downstream, plenty of people will have reasons to go downstream to go look for their loved ones or to try to recover valuables that have been washed away. You don't need floods either, plenty of people might fall in the river after a night of drinking or have boats capsize, for people to want to look downstream. Curiosity This is the biggest one. Once it's super easy to go downstream (just get in a raft and go!) people would want to. Some of them might be thieves who want to avoid the law. Some of them would hear about vast treasures to be had downstream. The river, cutting itself through the vast landscape, would be an inescapable lure, pointing itself down and out, away from everything you've ever known and giving you a path to follow into the unknown. 

Versus a regular six-limbed sort of flap (it's big so I didn't past it in). $URL$ But again, note how much length is given up to be a continuous wing to let rib-like projections work. I think this version is much more anatomically feasible than the first option, fitting the rib sails directly above the ribs to the sides of the spinal process. Though you might end up with a humanoid creature that is built very deep and broad of chest, with a buffalo hump. They would be humanoid but not humanlike in shape. The "buffalo hump" need not stand out. Buffalo have their hump because their neural spines are tall to support the weight of their heads. You can see the same with rhinos, which do not look particularly humpy, but have tall neural spines as well. 

Something to keep in mind is dialect shift. If the dialect shifts enough, it can become another language. One of the most amusing things that ever happened to me was watching a movie in Portuguese, not realizing it was Portuguese, and thinking it was the lousiest Spanish dialect I'd ever heard. I understood 85% of it, and assumed any words I didn't get were those that had just been slurred by the "crap" accent, and then I turned the subtitles on and realized it was Portuguese. If you know a second language, say, in the Romance family (Latin, French, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese) listen to one of the near relatives and you can pick out what sounds/words remain consistent across languages so you can get an idea of what vowel shift sounds like. If you don't know a second language the website here can help: Romance Language Comparisons by showing you the similarities between Romance languages for given vocabulary and phrases So, for example "Good Morning/Good day" in English is: Bonjour in French, Buongiorno in Italian, Buenos dias in Spanish, Bom dia in Portuguese. Note the way "Bom"/"buom"/"buen"/"Bon" hangs on as part of the greeting. That can give you an idea of what sorts of sounds will remain and become part of a new language. It is also worth considering what might get lopped off, or changed as linguistics shift. Disclosure: I have a contract job evaluating standardized test response for an educational company. Lately the tests have expanded to include short essays. But these are essays written as English as a Second Language from native Spanish speakers. So, Spanish rules about spelling and word order are applied to English vocabulary, due to.... well, shit teaching methods focused too much on getting the right accent than syntax rules. The resulting essays.... are weird. We see words words like "yogurt" getting written like "llogul" (ll in Spanish has a sound like an English g or j or in this sense y), "horse" appears like "jors" (the starting h in a Spanish word is silent, 'habichuelas'[beans] is pronounced like "abichuelas" with the ch -depending on the speaker- sounding like ch from "choo-choo" or "sh" like 'shush'; "daughter" comes out as "dotar'. We have an informal competition about who gets the 'zinger', the one word/phrase that just makes the reader ready to tear their eyes out at the fail. (Last year's "winner" was "nospiki/Ynospiqui" which took steps to break down as: "Y No spiqui" > "I No speak" to mean "I don't speak" as in, the non-answer, "I don't speak [English]." ('Y' being used in a really weirdly pronounced way as a way to transliterate 'I', because sometimes here I gets pronounced as eI, which sounds similar to y (not like "why" but as "ee" as in "Eek, a mouse!" in Spanish) So, once these people of yours are isolated from each other,you're going to get linguistic shifts just due to bottlenecking factors. If you have a group where everyone pronounces'horse' like 'jors', then that's probably going to be how they write it too. This is sort of found in the difference whether the Pepsi soft drink is called "pop", "soda" or "coke" depending on where you are in the United States. All in all, lingual shifts are fascinating to watch happen. In short, start listening to where native Hindi speakers start to butcher English and use that as seeds for dialect/creole shifts, from there, follow the shifts to a logical and stable conclusion. "Nospiqui" ended up being an extremely consistent and common non-answer across school locations, down to the spelling. If you'd like to read up on linguistic shifts, the book The Story of English by Robert McCrum et.al, starts at where English began as a Germanic dialect to today. The BBC did a nine-episode hour long series on the book as well, so that could be a way to fast-track learn about it. English itself developed in that fashion from it's ur-germanic predecessor.

Probably the primary concerns would be that people did not use magic for illicit purposes (putting curses on people, etc.). A secondary concern might be something like encouraging education about magic, or if magic is an inborn rather than learned ability, seeking out and identifying magic-users. It would probably issue magic licenses to those who could pass a basic competency test, and fine those who used magic in certain ways without having a license. 

If there are several races with very distinct appearances (e.g. Nordic-pale vs. Arabic-tan skin, red vs. black hair, etc.), how much space / natural barriers do I need between their homelands to justify these distinctions? Also, some of the races may have cultural taboos against interbreeding, but most do not. (In this case, there is a desert in the center of the known world, with several oasis cities scattered in it, and other cultures are more or less evenly spaced around it.) 

A desert planet is not unrealistic at all - plenty of them exist. A desert planet able to support life would presumably be possible, if given the right kind of atmosphere. A completely-ocean planet would not be too implausible either: it would be just like earth, but with much deeper oceans. An entirely-jungle planet, however, may be difficult, as it would need to have a roughly-consistent temperature. With a bit of modifications, there could be fast-growing plants that can survive in any climate (especially if the planet's axis is not tilted so that the amount of sunlight each plant gets is constant). You could certainly have a planet completely covered in plants, but it seems unrealistic for all the plants to be tropical (which may be part of the definition of a jungle). 

I was wondering what would happen if there was a planet with a "shell" of stone entirely surrounding it (not connected, just held in place by gravity), with a few holes all the way through the outer shell, and two civilizations - one on the outside, and one on the inside. Would this be feasible? Would the outer shell need to be made of a specific material for it to work? Besides the fact that the outer civilization would likely suffer from droughts (as all the water flows into the interior), what consequences could this have on the two civilizations?
