It can be difficult and misleading to try to comprehend Kierkegaard line by line. Like Lao Tzu, he's a philosopher of paradox, and you gain an apprehension of the grand sweep of his ideas by considering his series of oppositions in context, not by focusing in on the individual details. With that said, the paradox or opposition here is that man is and is not a self. The first part is just a transitive syllogism, man is spirit, spirit is self, therefore man is self --very logical and Hegelian. But from here it all goes haywire. Self, as you notice, is defined recursively, it is a single thing in relationship with itself; a closed loop; a stable identity. Man, on the other hand, is a synthesis between incommensurable opposites, the infinite and the finite. So man is a relationship, but not the relationship that defines self. Therefore man cannot be self, yet we already demonstrated that man is self. At this point, as with a Zen koan, you are simply supposed to meditate a while on the paradox. 

There are any number of replies and counter-replies to each of these. The first four are less commonly referred to in modern times because they are essentially idealist, and the modern perspective has made a sharp shift towards materialism. For that reason, the last argument has become the most prominent. The most currently prominent counter-argument is Dawkins' contention that the theory of evolution renders a purposeful designer for life unnecessary. A counter-counter-argument might be that this just pushes the evidence of design back one level (i.e. that the existence of biological evolution is evidence that the universe was designed to be fecund). 

Race is a social construct, although one loosely based around some biological realities. Consider the following: 

The larger context in Plato is always the idea that everything in the ordinary reality we experience is a imperfect copy of something more Real, Perfect, True and Eternal. The problem addressed by this specific passage is that nothingness can't be a copy of anything Real -- therefore, in Plato's view, we shouldn't even be able to speak about it or conceive of it. The answer is that we're not actually talking about "Real" nothingness (which is a contradiction in terms), we're talking about an extremely weakened, corrupted version of somethingness. We conceive of nothing only by taking our concepts of something, and removing traits. To relate this back to your example, the fantasy that I won the lottery is false, yet it is constructed from corrupted versions of concepts based on real things (and Real things). 

I would say that philosophies very greatly in terms of context dependency. I'm sure every philosophy is best understood with a little historical context around it, but some benefit more from this than others. For instance, I would consider Socrates' work, which is critical of Athenian society, to be less context dependent than Aristotle's work, which heavily draws upon Athenian customs. Even with Socrates, however, some context helps. You have to understand, for instance, how different the Greek conception of homosexuality was to the modern one in order to understand a number of the dialogs touching on the subject, and if you don't understand that many of the dialogs were gently mocking well-known celebrities of the day, you miss most of the humor. Similarly, to really understand Confucius, you need to be steeped in Chinese cultural traditions of the period. On the other hand, the Tao Te Ching, which is oriented away from the mundane world and towards a more mystical view of the cosmos, is less context-dependent despite being highly allusive. I haven't personally read the Russell book you referenced, but you might compare it to the source philosophies it references and see if those are more or less accessible than his work. After all, in order to understand the Russell, you really need two separate historical contexts --the context for the philosophy, and the context for Russell. 

Even the most orthodox traditionalist accepts that the Bible in particular is a consensus anthology of religious texts compiled over the course of hundreds or thousands of years, and comprising work created by the hand of many different human authors (with divine guidance assumed for both the writing and the selection process). Within the larger work, some sections are generally considered primarily concerned with laws (i.e. Leviticus), others with history (I Kings), others with values (Proverbs), others with philosophy (Ecclesiastes), others are poetic (Psalms), and some are either explicitly metaphorical (the parables of Jesus) or often assumed to be (Song of Solomon). This is uncontroversial to even the most conservative authorities. Given this, it is quite reasonable that a believer could judge some sections as metaphorical without committing to taking all of them in that manner --a case that is easier to make for the Bible in particular than for religious works attributed to a single author. As far as the specific case of the Bible's view of God, the Bible generally presents the true nature of God as beyond human comprehension, so in that sense, all Biblical presentations of God can be viewed as "metaphorical" in a loose sense of the word. 

Yes, study advanced symbolic logic. My degree is in philosophy, not computer science, but I've been a successful professional programmer for several years, and my philosophical background, especially in logic, was a big help. A well-written computer program is really nothing more than a long, complex, logic puzzle. (Also, studying general philosophy will help you be less impacted by the madness of the modern corporate workplace.) 

In the first case, the person means at a minimum that people are specifically and individually thinking of a thing. The second statement uses "thinking of" in a much more abstract and general sense. So the second speaker is pointing out the absurdity of a premise that the first speaker never actually committed to. 

When we make statements in natural language there are ambiguities and layers of meaning in even simple statements, but translating them into formal logic removes those. In this case the original statement tells us that she is a single parent and that she needs all the help she can get (the AND statement from the book). It also seemingly implies that if one is a single parent, then one needs all the help you can get (your IMPLIES statement). However, in terms of logic, the AND statement is much stronger --knowing that both the AND version and the IMPLIES version are true tells us exactly the same information about this person as just the AND version alone. To elaborate: If you have IF A THEN B you don't necessarily have A or B, you just have a guarantee that in the case you have A you also have B. So knowing that you do have A AND B is a lot more info than knowing IF A THEN B, because if you have A AND B, you always also have IF A THEN B. In fact if you even just have B, then you still will always have IF A THEN B. The reason this is counter-intuitive is that in natural language, when we say "If A then B" we're usually not talking about one A and B, but a whole set of A's and B's --for instance, all single parents --which does in fact convey additional information. You can't express that in basic propositional logic --you would need predicates and quantifiers in order to do so. 

In the case there is a God who created the universe, but does not play an active role in the universe post-creation, why try to understand that God? This is analogous to the question "in the case the universe began with a Big Bang, but that Big Bang event was unique and will never occur again, then why try to understand it?" In either case, the answer is that knowing the origins of the universe can presumably be a source of insight into understanding the nature and characteristics of the universe. 

It is more complex and convoluted to explain why other human beings would present such an utterly convincing simulation of consciousness and sentience than to simply assume that they are conscious and sentient. 

This is essentially a variation on appeal to authority. The person claims to have expertise that exceeds yours, because he supposedly understands both your position, and a superior one. The key here is that this itself is not an argument. If he really once held your exact position, and changed his mind for good, cogent reasons, then he should provide those reasons instead of merely implying they exist. In other words, if he was convinced by an argument that successfully defeats yours, then why isn't he just using that argument instead? Like all informal fallacies, this gains strength from its plausibility. It is common for a person's views to evolve from a less correct position to a more correct one. But there's a difference between claiming something and demonstrating it. 

I read this as a comment on what Sartre would later describe as bad faith. Kierkegaard is seemingly having a wonderful time at the party, but he is like an actor playing a role. He is untrue to his real self. The essential emptiness of the experience leads him to a place of despair. The fact that no one seemed to notice the deception just makes it worse --his friends apparently prefer the fake Kierkegaard to the real one. Compare this recent music video for a dramatization of a similar situation. 

Speaking from personal experience as a Christian with Taoist sympathies, although it's far from a mainstream line of thought in either Christian or Taoist circles, the cause of reconciling the two is well known, and has been taken up by a number of different thinkers. Part of the motivation may come from the fact that Taoism is largely non-theistic, which makes it possible to incorporate aspects of Taoist philosophy into Christian practice (as well as many other different religious traditions), without the burden of also taking on incompatible claims about God or gods (compare Hinduism or Shintoism). Taoism also functions largely without any central prophet or Messianic figure whose authority could be considered by Christians as trespassing on that belonging to Jesus (compare Buddhism or Islam). There is also the fact that the Tao translates most naturally as "The Way," a term which, in the Christian tradition, is claimed by Jesus ("I am the Way, the Truth and the Life"). This fact may seem coincidental, but has been taken as significant by some writers.

Hume is using vulgar in its original sense, meaning "common." His claim is that all common systems of morality (he's probably largely thinking of Christian morality here) muddy the distinction between statements of fact like "water is wet" and statements of value like "water is good." The overall thrust of his argument is against the rationalist concept that the right moral judgment can be produced by reason (as usual, his main antagonist is Descartes). In building this argument, he leans on his empirical commitment to the idea that all statements of fact must be founded on sensory evidence. 

In the United States, the current acknowledged conservative party, the Republicans, is now (but not historically) made up of several different kinds of conservatives. The first is generally categorized as "social conservatives," who advocate the preservation or restoration of what they consider as "Judeo-Christian values." In practice, the core US social conservative issues are: 

It's not an exact match, but you might best be served by looking into the concept of the Noumenon, which is things that cannot be discerned by the senses. Kant, in particular, wrote influentially on the topic, describing the noumenal realm as consisting of things that might exist, but that are completely unknowable (to human beings). 

This is the classic problem of evil --it's just confusing people because you've introduced a nonstandard conceptualization of God. Laying aside the mathematical aspects, you're really asking about "God of the Philosophers", the unity of all perfections, considered abstractly. How can a perfect being contain or countenance any imperfection? One answer to this question that works particularly well for the "Mathematical God" is that some region of contrast is necessary for there to be any structure at all. In Platonism, Good is the only reality, evil is just the backdrop, a region of minimal good, just as cold is a region of minimal heat. If we take such a view, we see that a universe with no "evil" is a universe where all that exists is the unbroken singularity of the perfect being. When I conceptualize God mathematically, I think of the Mandelbrot Set, a purely mathematical object of infinite complexity and obvious beauty. Both the beauty and the complexity are contained in the structured pattern of points that tend to orbit towards the center ("heaven"?) or towards the outer darkness ("hell"?). Without the existence of a region outside the set, the set could have no structure. 

Structurally speaking, the progression is from the best possible city, with the wisdom lovers at the top, and the pleasure lovers at the bottom, to the worst possible city, which is the same structure upside-down. Under the parameters Plato outlines, you literally can't get any worse than the tyranny, so in that sense, it is definitively the end of the line. Arguably, however, the sequential order of the progression of city-states in the Republic is a pedagogical device rather than a hard-and-fast set of rules. Plato presumably knew that the real life versions of the governments he described didn't progress in that fashion 100% of the time. It is tempting to read the Republic as an actual survey of governmental types, given the sharpness of Plato's psychological and sociological insights. But, at root, the entire sequence is presented chiefly in service of understanding the composition of the human soul. Accordingly, there are some issues that arise when you try to take it too much at face value. Perhaps the most significant of these is the one you mention: Not only is there no way to exit the bottom of the sequence (i.e. no natural successor to the tyranny), there is no way to enter the top of the sequence (no natural predecessor to the republic, which Plato describes as produced through a set of highly unnatural and unlikely interventions). This makes it challenging or impossible to use as a blueprint for actual social reform (as Plato himself demonstrated to his own detriment). If the progression was actually accurate, every government would degrade into a tyranny and then stay there --there would be no other governmental types in the world. 

In some sense this quote just represents two sides of the same state of affairs. If we define power as the ability to impact the world and responsibility as the extent to which our personal choices can be held accountable for the events that occur, then our responsibility increases as our power increases, whether we use that power or not (since inaction becomes a choice in the case that one has the choice to act). 

Causation has been an open question in philosophy at least as far back as Hume's problematization of causation in An Enquiry concerning Human Understanding. As such, there's no one universally accepted, uncontroversial understanding of causation in the philosophical world. The specific problem with your proposal is that there can easily be multiple theories that do match a given set of data, including ones that call A a cause of B, when in reality A and B are independent consequences of C. This problem is sharpened in the case where you legitimize attribution of causation without explanation of the underlying mechanism.
