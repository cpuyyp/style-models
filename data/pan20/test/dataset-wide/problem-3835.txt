The factorization exists, but the hands-on part is too difficult. Maybe the K-Group doesn't have a lamda-ring structure? 

Edit: Here is a possible characterization. As mentioned in the comments above, the vanishing of the 1-truncated cotangent complex $\tau_{\leq 1}L_{B/A}$ of a map of rings $f \colon A \to B$ is equivalent to a lifting property with respect to square-zero extensions $T' \to T$. This follows from the fact that the space $Map(L_{T/A},M[1])$ is equivalent to the groupoid of square-zero extensions of $T$ over $A$ with kernel $M$. Here $M$ is a $T$-module. Rephrasing this, $\tau_{\leq 1} L_{B/A}$ vanishes if and only if $f$ has a lifting property with respect to morphisms of 0-truncated simplicial algebras such that the kernel is concentrated in degree 0 and squares to 0. Let's call these 0-concentrated. Then we can go on to look at morphisms of 1-truncated simplicial algebras with kernel $K$ concentrated in degree 1. The squaring-to-zero property is vacuous here, because a product of two elements in $\pi_1(K)$ will be in $\pi_2(K)$, which is zero by assumption. Let's call these 1-concentrated Then we find that $\tau_{\leq 2} L_{B/A}$ vanishes if and only if $f$ has a lifting property with respect to all 0- and 1-concentrated maps. This again holds because the cotangent complex classifies 0- and 1-concentrated maps. I think now it's clear how to go on: $\tau_{\leq n+1}L_{B/A}$ vanishes if and only if $f$ has a lifting property with respect to all $m$-concentrated maps with $m \leq n$. And the full cotangent complex vanishes if and only if $f$ has the lifting property with respect to $n$-concentrated maps for all $n$. These directions one looks at if one starts to check with respect to $n$-concentrated maps for $n \geq 1$ are sometimes called the derived directions. So Avramov's theorem might be rephrased as saying that under strong finiteness assumptions, unobstructedness in the classical directions implies unobstructedness in all derived directions. 

Assume we have an affine scheme $A$ that comes with a closed immersion into a smooth scheme $i \colon A \hookrightarrow M$, which is not necessarily affine. Does there exist an affine open subscheme $j \colon V \hookrightarrow M$ such that $A$ already embeds in $V$? Expressed in Diagrams, does there exist an affine open subscheme $V$ of $M$ such that we have a factorization 

In one special case of the Proj construction the functor is easy to write down, namely in the case of $\mathbb{P}^n$. The functor you get in $Sh(Cring^{op})$ is: $R$ gets mapped to split inclusions of $R$-modules $N \rightarrow R^{n+1}$ where $N$ is locally free of rank 1. A Zariski open of this functor is defined by taking the subfunctor Inclusions $j: N \rightarrow R^{n+1}$ such that composition with $p_i R^{n+1} \rightarrow R$ is an isomorphism. This gives you your n+1 Zariski opens. I think the general case should be something similar. 

This is an anwer to your last paragraph about L-trivial maps in other geometric categories. If you are only interested in schemes it doesn't tell you anything interesting. One thing that the cotangent complex is good at is measuring connectivity of a morphism of simplicial rings. This also holds without any finiteness assumptions on the ring. Recall that a morphism $f \colon A \to B$ of simplicial rings is called n-connective if it induces isomorphisms $\pi_i (A) \to \pi_i (B)$ in degrees $< n$ and a surjection $\pi_n (A) \to \pi_n (B)$ in degree $n$. There then is a result that states that if $f$ is $n$-connective, then the homology of the relative contangent complex $L_{B/A}$ vanishes in degrees $\leq n$. (I hope I got all the indices right.) So in particular, any equivalence of simplicial rings is L-trivial. One way of intepreting your question is to ask when the converse holds. What do I know if a morphism of simiplicial rings is L-trivial? There is a partial converse to the statement above. Namely, if a morphism $f \colon A \to B$ induces an isomorphism $\pi_0(A) \to \pi_0(B)$ and is L-trivial, then it is an equivalence! I find this pretty suprprising, as L is only a linear piece of data, but still manages to detect equivalences. 

Let $A$ be a Noetherian commutative ring and $I$ an ideal in $A$. It is pretty much trivial to see that every free $A/I$-Module is obtained from a free $A$-module by tensoring over $A$ with $A/I$: Just choose preimages for every generator and take the free module generated by them. I'm wondering whether the same remains true if I replace free by projective and finitely generated. One way to prove this would be the following: Let $X=Spec A$, $Z=Spec(A/I)$, and $U=Z^c$. If there were something like a an exact sequence $K_0(U) \rightarrow K_0(X) \rightarrow K_0(Z) \rightarrow 0$ the claim would follow, right? Does such a sequence exist? If I'm not mistaken, such a sequence exists if A is a Dedekind ring. Just to make it clear, here is the precise question: Question: Given a Noetherian commutative ring $A$, an ideal $I$ and a projective, finitely generated $A/I$-module $M$, does there exist a projective, finitely generated $A$-module $N$ such that $N/IN=M$? 

The definition of the obstruction bundle on the symplectic side is a finite dimensional supspace of the cokernel of the linearized operator of the pseudoholomorphic curve equation, p.978 of Fukaya-Ono:"Arnold Conjecture and Gromov Witten Invariant." As a die hard algebraic geometer, that's just to hard to digest... 

I can't tell you much about the relation to Voevodsky's work, but I can give you a quick summary of Derived Algebraic Geometry. In DAG you enlarge the category of geometric objects that you can study. It is easiest done by using the functorial approach. So a scheme is just a functor from commutative rings to sets. Now we'll first enlarge this category in the stacky direction. This means that we change the target of our functor. Instead of studying only set-valued functors we'll allow groupoid-valued functors. This leads to the stacks you are used to. But for some complicated moduli problems groupoids can't encode enough information. So we'll make the target category even bigger and allow for simplicial set valued functors. So now you have to study the category of functors from commutative rings to simplicial sets, also called the category of simplicial presheaves. In this category you have to impose the right descent and atlas conditions to find the objects that have the right to be called geometric. These guys will be called higher stacks. I think that what we have done so far is very similar to Voevodsky's construction. But I am absolutely not an expert on this. Probably one of the experts will show up here soon and explain that. So far we haven't derived anything. That starts when you also enlarge the domain category. The natural "derived category" for commutative rings is simplicial commuative rings. That's because the category of commutative rings is not abelian, and then simplicial objects are a good replacement for chain complexes. Derived algebraic geometry then is the study of functors from simplicial commutative rings to simplicial sets, or simplicial presheaves on simplicial commutative rings. Again you have to find the functors inside this category with the right descent and atlas conditions, and that's a lot of work. These guys are then called derived schemes, derived stacks and derived higher stacks. The geometric intuition for these derived schemes and stacks are that they are ordinary schemes plus a fuzzy cloud of nilpotents on steroids around them. They can encode much more information in their structure sheaf than ordinary schemes. A good example is the intersection of two subschemes in an ambient scheme. You can then construct a "derived intersection". This derived intersection intrinsically in its structure sheaf has encoded that it is an intersection, something you could never accomplish with normal nilpotents. The difference between the Toen-Vezzosi approach and the approach of Lurie is that TV use model categories where Lurie uses infinity-1 categories. Which approach you actually use is a matter of taste. I think the analogy is to either work coordinate free or with coordinates. A final comment: If you look into the papers on Luries website or into Toen-Vezzosis Homotopical Algebraic Geomtery II book, you'll find that they work in much greater generality. They do the whole program not on the category of simplicial commutative ring, but for quite general model categories. If you really are only interested in DAG, there are Toen's course notes on his homepage or Luries original thesis. 

One of the consequences of flatness of morphisms between projective schemes is that the dimension of the fibers stays constant. Maybe this is the reason for the term. I'm not sure whether this makes so much sense though. After all, the alps stay three dimensional all the time, but they don't really count as being "flat". But it probably would even much harder to climb them if they had one more dimension... At least if you think about something that has 0-dimensional fibers all the time and suddenly aquires one two-dimensional fiber flatness really makes sense in the usual sense. I tried drawing a picture here, but mathoverflow always eats my ascii art. 

I can't give you a complete answer apart from saying that this is definitely a hard problem! If you have a derived scheme $X$, you can always truncate to get an every-day scheme $t_0 (X)$. On the level of rings, this corresponds to truncating a simplicial ring $A$ to $\pi_0 (A)$. The canonical morphism $A \to \pi_0(A)$ is obviously 0-connected. A result of Waldhausen then tells you that $A$ and $\pi_0(A)$ have isomorphic $K_0$ and $K_1$. Now the Chow-Ring is more or less the same as $K_0$ (after tensoring with Q and up to rational equivalence). So I guess what this means is that on the level of cycles it is impossible to tell the difference between a derived scheme and an ordinary scheme, because $CH(X) = CH(t_0 (X)).$ I think the fancy way of saying this is that the etale topoi of $X$ and $t_0(X)$ are the same, but that is slightly over my head. This result can be found both in Luries thesis and in HAG II by Toen-Vezzosi. The situation immediately changes though if you work with Bloch´s higher Chow groups! They see the difference starting from $K_2$, since the higher Chow groups are tied to higher $K$-groups via a Riemann-Roch map. So on the level of these cycles you could tell a difference. 

Let $\Delta_{+}$ be the sub-category of the simplex category $\Delta$ containing only injective functions, and take $M$ to be a nice model category. I'll write $i \colon \Delta_{+} \hookrightarrow \Delta$ for the inclusion. Now assume we have a semi-simplicial diagram $X \colon \Delta_{+}^{\text{op}} \to M$. We can then form the left Kan extension $i_! X \colon \Delta^{\text{op}} \to M$, which adds the degeneracies to the semi-simplicial diagram $X$. Now here's my question: Is $$\text{hocolim}_{\Delta_{+}^{\text{op}}}X = \text{hocolim}_{\Delta^{\text{op}}}i_{!}X,$$ or are they at least equivalent? What about if I take a homotopy left Kan extension instead? I've got another question, but I'm afraid this might be too specific. A Segal groupoid in a model category $M$ is a simplicial object $X \colon \Delta^{\text{op}} \to M$ which satisfies the Segal condition, i.e. $$X_n \to X_1 \times ^h _{X_0} \dots \times ^h _{X_0} X_1$$ is a weak equivalence, and also $$d_0 \times d_1 \colon X_2 \to X_1 \times ^h _{d_0,X_0, d_0} X_1 $$ is a weak equivalence. The second condition says that every horn of type $b \leftarrow a \to c$ can be filled. Since both conditions only involve face maps, they make perfect sense for a semi-simplicial object too. So I guess it makes sense to ask, given a semisimplicial object $Y \colon \Delta_{+}^{\text{op}} \to M$ satisfying the two conditions above, is the (homotopy) left Kan extension $i_! Y$ a Segal groupoid in $M$? 

Does anything happen if I forget and tensor back up along a highly connective map of $E_{\infty}$-rings? Here's what I mean precisely: Let $f \colon A \to B$ be a $n$-connective map between connective $E_{\infty}$-rings, with $n \geq 1$. Here $n$-connective means that $\pi_i (fib(f))=0$ for $i < n$. Roughly, $f$ is a very surjective map, and if we let $fib(f)=I$, then $B$ is roughly $A/I$. Now let's take a $B$-module $M$. We can forget the $B$-module structure and view it as an $A$-module. Then we can tensor it back up again to get $B \otimes _A M$. By adjunction there is a canonical map $m \colon B \otimes _A M \to M$, which is the multiplication map. How far is this map from being an equivalence? The case I am really interested is when $f \colon A \to B$ is a square-zero extension obtained from a $n$-connective derivation $\eta \colon L_B \to M[1]$. Then $fib(f)$ can be identified with $M$, and so additonally has the structure of a $B$-module. Does anything special happen in this case?

You can try having a look at this paper: $URL$ It's the most functorial-minded paper on algebraic geometry I'ver ever seen. It's written by an algebraic topologist. He cares mostly about affine and formal schemes. The definition you're looking for is in section 4 of the paper. The functorial point of view for a formal scheme is a small filtered colimit of schemes, the colimit taken in the functor category. 

For a surjective morphism $f \colon X \to Z$ of smooth projective varieties, a line bundle $L$ on $X$ is $f$-nef if is nef on the fibers of $f$. More precisely, for every curve $C$ that is mapped to a point, the degree of $L$ restricted to $C$ should be larger than zero. Now it is not true that an $f$-nef bundle becomes nef if I tensor it with a sufficiently large power of an ample line bundle on $Z$. There is a counterexample in the Positivity book of Lazarsfeld, Example 1.7.12. Are there any conditions I can put on $L$ such that this statement becomes true? I'm interested in the case where $L = \mathcal{O}_X (-D)$ for an effective divisor D. 

If you work with the naive Chow-groups and allow non-representable morphisms the GRR-Theorem does not hold! In the paper by Toen quoted above and in some of the papers by Joshua there are explicit counterexamples. They always involve non-representable morphisms. There are two ways to get around this. The first is to modify the definition of the Chow-groups. This is what Toen does. He takes Chow groups with coefficients in the characters of the stack, which is quite an involved definition. But it leads to a GRR-theorem for DM-stacks. The second approach by Joshua is modify the topology to keep track of the stabilizer groups. He introduces a topology which he calls the isovariant etale site, which is motivated by ideas of Thomason. This gives a different kind of Chow groups. For this recall that you can define the Chow groups as cohomology of some sheaves using higher K-theory. For stacks this was done by Gillet. You can then get new kinds of Chow groups by calculating the cohomology of these sheaves in the isovariant etale topology. In a series of papers Joshua proves GRR-theorems in this context. 

This is just a little side remark that in general it does make a difference whether you take quotients as representable functors or as schemes. There is a counterexample in section 4 of $URL$ The counter example is as follows. Let R be the real number and Q the rationals. Then Q acts on R by translation. The quotiens R/Q is nothing reasonably geometric. But if we take h_R to be the functor represented by R, then the quotient h_R / Q is an algebraic space!
