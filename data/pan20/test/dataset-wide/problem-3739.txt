This answers a slightly different question, but if $X$ is the curve $x^2 = y^3$ in $\mathbb C^2$, then its normalization is $\mathbb C$. The normalization map $\mathbb C \to X$ is a homeomorphism of topological spaces, but is not an isomorphism of schemes. (If $A$ is the subalgebra of $\mathbb C[t]$ generated by $t^2$ and $t^3$, then $A = \mathcal O(X)$, and the normalization map $\mathbb C \to X$ is dual to the inclusion $A \to \mathbb C[t]$.) 

For example, the first paragraph, phrased in this language, is L = all prime knots O = input two knots and output their connected sum S = all knots 

Given a 3-manifold $M$, one can define the Kauffman bracket skein module $K_t(M)$ as the $C$-vector space with basis "links (including the empty link) in $M$ up to ambient isotopy," modulo the skein relations, which can be found in the second paragraph of section two of $URL$ (Side question - how can I draw these relations in Latex?) If $S$ is a surface, then $K_t(S\times [0,1])$ has an algebra structure given by stacking one link on top of another. If $S$ is a boundary component of $M$, then $K_t(M)$ is a (left) $K_t(S\times [0,1])$ module, where the left module structure is given by gluing $S\times \{1\}$ to the copy of $S$ in the boundary of $M$. In this situation, we can define a left module map $K_t(A\times [0,1]) \to K_t(M)$ which is uniquely defined by "(empty link in $S\times [0,1]$) maps to (empty link in $M$)." The "peripheral ideal" is the kernel of this module map, and is a left ideal of $K_t(S\times [0,1])$. The motivation for these definitions comes from knot theory - if $K$ is a knot in $S_3$, then the complement of a small tubular neighborhood of $K$ is a manifold with a torus boundary, and the algebra $K_t(T^2\times [0,1])$ and module $K_t(S^3 \setminus K)$ give information about the knot $K$. Now I can ask my question: Is there a manifold $M$ with a torus boundary such that the peripheral ideal is trivial? I've just recently started learning about knot theory, and I'm having a hard time trying to figure this out. One thing that I do know is that $M$ cannot be of the form $S^3 \setminus K$, because of propositions 7 and 8 in $URL$ I also suspect that $M$ will actually have two boundary components which are a torus, but I don't really have a good reason for this. Also, I suspect this might be a hard question, so any hints about one might approach it would be helpful. 

Here's something that isn't a complete rigorous proof, but maybe it can be completed to one (unless I'm missing something). Let's fix a non-positively curved metric on $F$ (which rules out the sphere, but I'd guess you're ok with that). Extend this to $F \times [0,1]$ using the product metric (where $[0,1]$ has its standard Euclidean metric). Pick an isotopy representative $L_\alpha$ of each class $\alpha \in \hat \pi^\circ$ which is $\epsilon$ close to a geodesic. (I'm not sure exactly how $\epsilon$ needs to depend on $\alpha$, but I'll ignore this.) Then the claim is that there is a linear isomorphism $Sym(\{L_\alpha\}) \to Sk_q(F)$. Now we can assign to a link the sum of the lengths of its components, and induct on this number. A couple properties: 1) Knots can be reordered using the skein relations, modulo terms of strictly lower length (by the triangle inequality, the resolution is strictly shorter). 2) Knots in different "layers" (in the $[0,1]$ direction) can be simplified separately since changing one knot doesn't change the lengths of the others. 3) Knots can be simplified to a unique geodesic using Reidemeister moves and skein relations, modulo terms of strictly lower length. I'm being a little vague on the third point, but I think it follows from Theorem 1.10 in [Hass, Scott, "Shortening curves on surfaces," Topology 1994], which is stated slightly differently in Theorem 2.10 in [D. Thurston, "Positive basis for surface skein algebras" PNAS 2013]. (The paper [HS] doesn't deal with knots in a thickened surface, but with their projections, which means that some of the Reidemeister 2 moves that their algorithm does need to be done with the skein relation. But this is ok because the resolution term in the skein relation has strictly shorter length.) I'm not sure, but my guess would be that translating this choice of ordering (the sum of the lengths) into a combinatorial description using the fundamental group might be not very nice. 

This isn't an answer to this exact question, but it sounds like the student may also be interested in hearing about Hopf algebras. 

This isn't a complete answer, but it might make some partial progress. First I'll slightly restate the question. If we decompose $S^3$ into two solid tori and write $C$ and $C^{op}$ for the Homfly skein modules of these tori, then there is a pairing $$\langle -,-\rangle: C\otimes_A C^{op} \to k$$ where $k$ is the base ring (which is isomorphic to the skein module of $S^3$) and $A$ is the Homfly skein algebra of the torus. As you say, both $C$ and $C^{op}$ have bases indexed by pairs of partitions, and if I understand right, the entries of the $S$ matrix are evaluations of this pairing. One brute-force approach for computing $\langle (\lambda, \mu), (\lambda',\mu')\rangle$ is to "move the left hand side to the right using the action of $A$ and then evaluate." An explicit presentation of $A$ is given here $URL$ There are generators $P(a,b)$ for $a,b \in \mathbb(Z)$ (which are "the $gcd(a,b)$ power sum on slope $b/a$"), and they satisfy the commutation relations $$[P(x), P(y)] = (q^d-q^{-d}) P(x+y),\quad x,y \in \mathbb Z^2,\quad d = det[x\,\,y]$$ (If $x$ and $y$ are primitive and $d=1$ this is just the skein relation.) The paper also gives explicit formulas for the action of the generators $P(a,b)$ in the basis $(\lambda,\mu)$ that you mentioned, and these formulas actually aren't too bad (e.g. if $a,b \not= 0$ then the entries in the matrix are monomials). One difficulty in completing the answer is that expressing the basis elements $(\lambda,\mu)$ in terms of power sums isn't too easy. (Morton does have a determinental formulas in terms of complete symmetric functions in one of his papers.) Also, I'm not sure if the evaluations $((\emptyset, \emptyset),(\lambda,\mu)\rangle$ have actually been computed. (By the way, this algebra $A$ actually has a lot of different realization which are not obviously the same. One other realization is as (a specialization of) the Hall algebra of coherent sheaves on an elliptic curve over a finite field (this is described in the paper above). Also, if you've found these numbers since the question was asked I'd be curious to hear.) 

(Just to be precise, in this question, the word "knot" means "ambient isotopy class of a (EDIT: smooth) knot in $S^3$.") A knot in $S^3$ is called prime if it is not the connected sum of two other non-trivial knots in $S^3$. Clearly any knot is a sum of prime knots, and it is a theorem that this decomposition is unique. One downside of this is that there are infinitely many prime knots (for example, all non-trivial torus knots are prime). Here's a vague version of the question - Is there a way to trade off the uniqueness result (and add finitely many operations) in exchange for starting with a finite list of knots? To try to make my question a little more precise, I'll define an "operation" as a function that takes a list of knots as input and outputs a finite list of knots. I'm not sure how to say this well, but I'd like to avoid very dumb operations like "fix an ordered list of all knots $K_1,K_2,\ldots$ and if $K_i$ is input, output $K_{i+1}$." However, I am interested in dumb answers, just not as dumb as that :-) 

The question that I'd like to answer can be generalized to the following: if $M$ is an orientable 3-manifold and $F$ is a boundary component of $M$ (which may have other boundary components), can an arbitrary diffeomorphism of $F$ with itself be extended to a diffeomorphism of $M$ with itself? I would be very surprised if the answer to the question in this generality is yes, so I'll ask a more specific question. 

As far as I understand from your statement of the conjecture, the conjecture is false, although there are similar statements that are true. If I understand correctly, a weaker question (more likely to have the answer yes) would be "can one recover a variety from its category of D-modules." For a non-example of the weaker question, if $X = Spec(\mathbb{C}[x])$ and $Y = Spec(\mathbb{C}[x^2,x^3])$, then D(X) and D(Y) are Morita equivalent. If X is a smooth curve and Y is another curve, then D(X) is Morita equivalent to D(Y) iff X and Y are homeomorphic (in the example above, the normalization map gives a homeomorphism $X \to Y$). If $X = Spec(\mathbb{C}[x])$, then the natural numbers parameterize isomorphism classes of curves Y with D(X) Morita equivalent to D(Y). A similar-sounding statement which is true is "If X and Y are smooth curves, they are isomorphic iff D(X) and D(Y) are isomorphic (as algebras)." A paper with these and many more facts can be found here $URL$ 

A knot $K \subset S^3$ is fibered if the complement $S^3 \setminus K$ of (a small open neighborhood of) $K$ is a fiber bundle over $S^1$. (The fiber will be a surface with one boundary component.) 

I'm not sure if this is what you're looking for, but in $URL$ Dunkl and Opdam define a deformed differential $d(k) = d + \Omega(k)$ on the polynomial de Rham complex on a vector space with an action by a complex reflection group $G$. Here $k$ is a parameter, $d$ is the standard de Rham differential, and $\Omega(k)$ is a 1-form depending on the parameter $k$. The (nontrivial) proof (Thm 2.9) that $d(k)$ is actually a differential (i.e. that it squares to 0) is used to show that the Dunkl operators associated to the complex reflection group $G$ commute. Proving this commutativity directly would require difficult computations. (The Dunkl operator $T_\epsilon(k)$ for $\epsilon \in V$ is a deformation of the directional derivative $\partial_\epsilon$ depending on the parameter $k$, see formula (5). Dunkl defined these operators for real reflection groups in 1989, which is why they have that name.) 

To answer a slightly generalized question, there are nonunital ring maps between unital rings that come up naturally. If $e \in A$ is an idempotent, then the ring of elements of the form $eAe$ inherits its additive and multiplicative structure from $A$, but its identity element is $e$ and not $1_A$. For example, if $k$ is a commutative ring and $m < n$ then the map $M_m(k) \to M_n(k)$ given by "padding by 0's" is a natural nonunital map of unital algebras. Under certain circumstances the rings $A$ and $eAe$ are Morita equivalent, so this type of situation can be useful in representation theory. 

To solve it, you can first reformulate it as follows: nails correspond to punctures in the plane, and removing a nail corresponds to filling in a puncture. The fundamental group of such a space is freely generated by loops around each puncture, and filling in a puncture corresponds to quotienting by one generator. We'd like a loop that is killed in each of these quotients, and it's easy to write one down inductively using iterated commutators. 

I don't know what the original motivation was (or where the original definition was). But one reasonable conceptual explanation for the definition is this: let $\mathcal C$ be a category with objects $\mathbb N$, endomorphisms $A_n$, and other morphism spaces 0. Then the embeddings $A_m \otimes A_n \to A_{m+n}$ (and the associativity conditions) are what is needed to provide $\mathcal C$ with a strict monoidal structure, where $m \otimes n := m + n$. Then one reason towers of algebras tend to be interesting is that monoidal categories tend to be interesting. 

I just came across a paper of Waldhausen (On Irreducible 3-manifolds Which are Sufficiently Large) where he says "Frequently, a proof involves a sequence of constructions, each of which in turn involves alterations of some things. To avoid an orgy of notation in such cases, we often denote the altered things by the old symbols." 

I recently heard this puzzle from Dror Bar-Natan, and there's a nice solution using the fundamental group. 

(This wouldn't fit in the comment box.) It looks like your expression is just a rewritten form of the first sum. If you split your sum into two sums, reindex the second by $n \mapsto n-1$, and recombine the sums, then things cancel and you get $\sum_{n=3}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n^s}$. Then it looks like the first few terms that are left over are the $n=1$ and $n=2$ terms in the original sum. Did I miss something? 

I don't really know how to approach this, but here's a couple thoughts: 1) If I understand right, this question can be reduced to the question of whether the subgroup of the mapping class group of $M$ that preserves $F$ surjects onto the mapping class group of $F$ (since it's my impression that isotopies can be extended from submanifolds). 2) If we lower the dimension by 1 it seems like the answer is yes, at least if the last comment was right. To see this, let $C$ be the boundary component that is to be sent to itself, and write the surface as a quotient of a polygon in $\mathbb R^2$ that is symmetric about the origin. Also, center the boundary component $C$ around the origin, and put the other boundary components symmetrically around the origin. Then the antipodal map in $\mathbb R^2$ induces a diffeomorphism of $F$ with the desired properties. (I'm not sure about tags - retag as appropriate.) 

Here is one reason not to expect such a relationship (although I'm not sure if it can be completed to a proof). The Jones polynomial $J_\sigma$ (roughly) comes from taking the trace of a linear map $A_\sigma$ associated to the braid $\sigma$, so the question (roughly) asks about relations between $Tr(A_\sigma)$, $Tr(A_\tau)$, and $Tr(A_\sigma A_\tau)$. Let $a,b$ generate a free group $\pi$, and let $Chr$ be the $SL_2$ character scheme of $\pi$ (i.e. the space of pairs of $SL_2$ matrices considered up to simultaneous conjugation). Define $Tr(g):Chr \to \mathbb C$ to be the function $\rho \mapsto Tr(\rho(g))$. Then the functions $Tr(a)$, $Tr(b)$, and $Tr(ab)$ are algebraically independent. So there shouldn't be any universal formula relating these three traces, whether $a,b \in SL_2$ or are bigger matrices.
