A Pythagorean fraction is a number of the form $a/b$ or $b/a$ where $a$ and $b$ are the legs of a Pythagorean triple. Are there simple necessary and/or sufficient conditions for determining whether a rational number can be expressed as a ratio of two Pythagorean fractions? As an example, I would be interested to know if $4/9$ can be expressed as a ratio of two Pythagorean fractions. A brute force search of all primitive Pythagorean triples $(a,b,c)$ with $c < 6000$ found that $4/9$ could not be written as a ratio of two Pythagorean fractions when one of the fractions has a corresponding hypotenuse less than 6000. 

Suppose that $X,Y$ are compact metric spaces, and $g:X\rightarrow Y$ is a multivalued mapping that is both upper and lower hemicontinuous. Is there a single valued continuous selection of $g$? If it helps, $X$ and $Y$ are compact subsets of finite dimensional normed spaces, but $g(x)$ is not convex, in general. 

I was very surprised when I first saw that the product of all primes $p$ such that $p-1|2n,$ is the denominator of Bernoulli number $B_{2n}$. 

There is a popular game in current cellphones called Pixelated (in BlackBerry) or Flood-It (in iPhone) that has a very interesting analysis (its generalization is equivalent to the Shortest superstring problem): $URL$ $URL$ 

Bulls and cows and its modern variant Mastermind, for which Don Knuth demonstrated that the codebreaker can win in at most five moves. Playing this game with pencil and paper (in a way where both players are codemakers and codebreakers) can be very fun. 

Each block of every partition has at most $k$ elements. Every pair of elements of $N$ is in the same block in exactly one partition. 

Given a Ferrers board of shape $(b_1,\ldots,b_m)$, we define $r_k$ as number of ways to place $k$ non-attacking rooks (as in Chess). In section 2.4 of Stanley's Enumerative Combinatorics (vol. 1) it's shown the identity: $$\sum_k r_k (x)_{m-k} = \prod_i (x+s_i)$$ where $s_i = b_i-i+1$, but I don't know if I can invert this formula or make an efficient algorithm to compute the $r_k$'s. If this isn't possible, I would be satisfied if I can compute them efficiently in the following shapes: $(2,2,4,4,\ldots,2n-2,2n-2,2n)$ $(2,2,4,4,\ldots,2n,2n)$ $(1,1,3,3,\ldots,2n-1,2n-1,2n+1)$ 

Garrett Birkhoff used the Hilbert metric (he called it the projective metric) to prove that every $n$-by-$n$ matrix $A$ with positive entries is a Hilbert metric contraction on the cone of nonnegative vectors. He gave a formula for the contraction constant which is $\frac{1}{4} \arctan \Delta $ where $\Delta$ is the maximum Hilbert's (projective) metric distance between $Ae_i$ and $Ae_j$ where $e_i$ and $e_j$ are distinct elementary basis vectors. This immediately implies one aspect of the Perron-Frobenius theorem: that matrices with positive entries have a unique Perron eigenvector. G. Birkhoff, Extensions of Jentzsch’s theorem. Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. 85 (1957), 219–227. The Hilbert metric proof of the Perron-Frobenius theorem also extends to nonlinear maps which are monotone and homogeneous of degree one (i.e., $f(\lambda x) = \lambda f(x)$, $\forall \lambda > 0$). This is the primary advantage of using the Hilbert metric to prove the Perron-Frobenius theorem. 

If we can formalize the property of "being a good math joke" good enough to construct a Turing Machine that checks it, then I think we can conclude they don't exist. The reason is that in that case we can construct a Turing Machine (say of length N) that checks each possible string, and stops only if a good math joke was found. The busy beaver function on N establishes an upper bound for the number of strings the machine needs to check until we can conclude that it wouldn't halt (and therefore no good math jokes exist). Based on empirical evidence, it may be possible that all those cases have already been checked (with negative answer), which implies my thesis. (I'm being ironical, I like much of the jokes posted in here :P) 

Given $n,k\in\mathbb{N}$ where $k\leq n$, I want to compute the minimum subset of the set of partitions of $N$={$1,\ldots,n$}, satisfying these properties: 

Let $C$ be a pointed polyhedral cone in $\mathbb{R}^n$ and let $S^{n-1}$ denote the unit sphere in $\mathbb{R}^n$. Given a description of the supporting hyperplanes of $C$ is there an algorithm for computing the spherical measure of $C \cap S^{n-1}$? I suppose you could randomly generate points uniformly distributed on the unit sphere, and test each point to see if it is in $C$. Is there a better way? 

Here a question that has me stumped. Maybe someone familiar with algebraic or differential curves can help. Suppose that $\gamma:[0,1] \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ is an analytic function. Is it true that the range of $\gamma$ is either homeomorphic to a line segment or contains a subset homeomorphic to $S^1$? 

Suppose that $p(t) = a_0 + a_1 \cos(t)+ b_1 \sin(t) + a_2 \cos(2t) + b_2 \sin(2t)$ is a quadratic trig polynomial with complex coefficients. Assume that $a_2$ and $b_2$ are not real multiples of the same number. Is it true that $p(t)$ has at most finitely many self-intersections, that is, are there at most finitely many pairs $t_1, t_2 \in [0,2\pi)$ such that $p(t_1) = p(t_2)$ and $t_1 \neq t_2$? 

Although the closed formula is what I wanted, a dynamic programming approach behaves better algorithmically: Define $M_{i,j}$ as the number of ways to place $j$ non-attacking rooks on the Ferrers board of shape $(b_1,\ldots,b_i)$. So we want $M_{m,k}$, which can be computed using the relations: $M_{i,0}=1$, $M_{0,j}=0$ if $j>0$, and if $i,j>0$: $$M_{i,j} = M_{i-1,j} + (b_i-j+1) M_{i-1,j-1}.$$ 

Given the $n\times m$ rectangle, I want to compute the minimum number of integer-sided squares needed to tile it (possibly of different sizes). Is there an efficient way to calculate this? 

One way to generate random matrices while constraining it, is to generate its LU decomposition first. That way you can restrict it to be symmetric ($L=U^T$) and gives you the control over its spectrum. In [S.M. Rump. A Class of Arbitrarily Ill-conditioned Floating-Point Matrices. SIAM J. Matrix Anal. Appl. (SIMAX), 12(4):645-653, 1991] there is a related method for generating very ill-conditioned matrices.
