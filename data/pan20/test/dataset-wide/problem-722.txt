If a signal isn't picking you up, it's malfunctioning and needs to be fixed. It's a hazard. Note the exact location, day of week and time of day, and report the hazard. You didn't say exactly where in the bay area you are. However, East Bay Bicycle Coalition and Sonoma County Bicycle Coalition have hazard reporting systems on their sites. Silicon Valley Bicycle Coalition and Marin County Bicycle Coalition have guides to help you figure out who to call. 

Get a professional bike fitting Don't hold the bars tightly, hold them loosely Gloves with padding matching the pads of your palm (no pad on central channel, that will make things worse). Sadly many gloves aren't really designed to help, so you have to know what to look for. Some bar grips are designed to help Changing how you ride to put less pressure on your hand (use core muscles to hold body up) Raise handlebars and/or move them closer to you so that you have less pressure on your hands Handlebar ends to give more hand positions Different style handlebars (new bike with drop bars?) for more hand positions, preferably with main position not putting pressure in center of palm Vary your hand positions more often. If you have bars that allow multiple hand positions, use them. Take breaks during your ride. Even just taking your hands off the bars for a minute at a stop light could help. There may be stretches you can do during such breaks to help Pedal harder/faster. If you pedal hard enough, you'll find yourself pulling your body down with the handlebars instead of pressing down on your hands. Run your tires at a lower pressure. Replace with fatter tires if necessary. This should help reduce road vibration. 

What I find helps, is: tap the valve post a bit to let out a small blast of air (after loosening the captive nut all the way, of course). That helps unstick things and lowers the pressure inside a bit to make it easier to start pumping air in. Just takes a quick tap. If you don't do that, you may need to pump slightly past the pressure of the tire to actually start pumping air in. A Schrader valve is a spring-loaded valve that the pump head opens up by pushing down on a pin. That means that once the head is engaged, pressure is equalized between the pump hose and the inner tube of the tire. When you engage the head, some air comes out of the tube into the pump head and hose, and when you work the pump, you're immediately pumping air into the tube/tire. A Presta valve doesn't have a spring. The valve is kept closed with air pressure, and the captive nut helps ensure nothing bumps the valve open. The pump head generally does not press down to force the valve open, and instead the valve is opened by increasing the pressure in the hose past the pressure inside the tube/tire. You generally have to pump until the pressure in the pump/hose/head matches what's in the tube before any air actually flows into the tube/tire, and sometimes a bit past that. I suspect that the "pop" you're hearing is when external (hose) pressure overcomes the Presta valve, it opens up, and pressure equalizes suddenly between the pump hose and the tube. 

Yes, if it's really cold outside it can be hard to patch. Been lucky enough not to get a flat when it was that cold, but thinking I could still figure out how to get a flat dealt with wearing gloves (for part of it?), alternating between working on flat and sticking hands under clothes, or convincing a store to let me in, or with slow leak some repeated tire pumping to get somewhere and then fix flat... Even huddling on the leeward side of an embankment would make a big difference Usual: 

I think the LBS is partially correct, that bikes with disc brakes aren't generally designed to hold a rack. That said, I think there's a few solutions (other than getting a bike built to have disc brakes and a rack): 

One-wheeled trailers are more agile and don't increase the width of your bike. They lean with the bike. If you're going to go really narrow places, you need one-wheel. Two-wheeled trailers can generally carry more weight and are less prone to making the bike fall over when you stop. So, what are you going to do with the trailer? Going up and down mountains with narrow trails: get a one-wheeled trailer. Carrying 50kg of equipment from the hardware store home using streets and wide paths: get a two-wheeled trailer. 

Pedal with the ball of your foot over the spindle of the pedal. This is generally considered the "correct" place, and leaves your foot only going a little forward of the pedal. Some beginners put the arch of their foot on the pedal, which is likely to be uncomfortable on platform pedals, and puts your foot more forward. 

The key thing, is that you never want to be to the right of cars that are turning right. Depending on the exact lane setup and traffic amounts, I would do one of these: 

You might be able to use something like the Low down light mount bolted through that hole to give you a little bit of post hanging from the hole and use that with the seatpost mount... You might be able to mount the hardware without the seatpost mechanism to the hole of an L-bracket mounted in that hole... With racks with a more serious light mounting bracket instead of just a horizontal hole, I've found many light can clip directly to the bracket with no extra hardware at all, like so: 

(doing a little research, number 3 is the "Gates Center Track" that just came out at Interbike 2011 and the bike I saw with it was probably one of the first production bikes of that model off the assembly line) 

It's worth asking at your LBS. If you've got more than one LBS, try asking them all. :) I don't know if most bike shops have it, but I know at least one of my LBSs has a piece of equipment that cuts a spoke and puts a thread on it at the same time. They routinely cut (and thread) spokes to length. From talking with one of their employees, I guess it was a better deal for them than trying to stock a ton of different length spokes. Rims might be a few fairly standard sizes, but there's a lot of variety in hub flange diameter. Spoke lacing pattern also affects the needed lengths. In other words, even your unusual size might be something they already stock. Or if they've got something that's just a millimeter or two too long, it's probably possible to cut it without putting thread on it and still have a useful spoke. 

Well, in 2010 there's the S1, S2 and S3. S1 is lower-end and has 50/34. In 2011, they dropped the S1 and there's only the S2 and S3. (based on what's up on their website right now) The lowest end of the line is probably considered something like "entry level" or at least "not for racers", so it gets the "slower" chainring setup. They've kept the chainring size on the cheapest bikes in the line the same, they just moved the labels for what the cheapest bike is. And it's probably all about marketing and whatnot, nothing to do with any real solid technical reasons. 

You could always get a laptop sleeve and slide that into a big enough pannier. Timbuk2 has a couple pannier options that both have an included laptop sleeve and are designed to be easily carried off the bike. One converts to a messenger bag, the other more of a "shoulder bag". Looks like Timbuk2 has some of their stuff sold retail in the UK, and they also do direct orders with international shipping. I don't have either bag, but I do have a laptop messenger and a couple regular messenger bags from them that I've been happy with. Their site is a bit of a pain to provide links to, but looks like Basil has a similar kind of laptop messenger pannier. Their site shows plenty of distribution in the UK. Ortlieb's rear/larger panniers have an "Office" and "Downtown" line that both seem to be designed to accomodate a 15 inch laptop (via a sleeve/insert you purchase separately). Two different mounting options. What I actually do when carrying the laptop on my bike is either bungee a laptop messenger to the top of the rack or stick a (well-padded) sleeve into a pannier

No. In a car, the weight distribution is relatively even and you tend to get a relatively even wear, so that if 2 or 3 tires are obviously ready for replacement, you probably just can't tell that the others are ready. I suspect that also having 1 tire with a different amount of tread wear than the other tires on a car will lead to an unbalanced configuration that causes tires to wear out faster. (especially a left-right imbalance) With a bicycle, the rear tire gets more weight on it than the front and will generally wear out more quickly. By as much as 3:1. Because of this, and other reasons, some people will even use a totally different tire on front than on the back. (could have the narrower tire on the front or on the back, depending on what you want to achieve) On a bicycle, it's perfectly fine if one tire has worn down to being effectively smaller than the other. You will never notice if the bike is "leaning" a millimeter or two forward or back. The rear also tends to pick up more thorns/nails/screws/glass than the front, so there's also that reason the rear may need to be replaced sooner. The usual theory I've heard is that the front tire knocks the sharp things into a point up configuration in time for the rear tire to catch them, but I strongly suspect that it's more about weight distribution: the tire with more weight has a bigger contact patch and will push down harder on something it rolls over. Overuse of the rear brake instead of learning to use the front brake properly can cause the rear to wear out even quicker. You also don't want to rotate your tires between front and back. That's something suggested with some cars, I think because you tend to wear the front differently than the back and can get a longer life that way. However, if you're using the same type of tires on the front and the back, and it's the rear tire that's being replaced, you probably want to move the front to the back, and put the new tire on the front. You always want your best tire on the front. A blowout in the rear is scary and inconvenient, but a blowout on the front is very likely to lead to a crash. You also need the traction on the front for stopping much more than you need traction on the rear for acceleration. (and because your weight shifts forward as you stop, you just can't get very much traction on the rear for stopping) Reference: $URL$ 

(If I could afford it and had those needs, I'd talk to my local framebuilder since he's on the S&S framebuilder list and does a bit of tandem stuff even if he doesn't list prices for them yet. But framebuilders closer to you are probably a better option than one in my town.) 

Travel mug - Specifically, the AUTOSEAL® West Loop Stainless Steel Travel Mug (Vacuum Insulated). It fits easily in either water bottle cage (they're nylon so less likely to scratch it). It keeps hot things hot for at least a couple hours. It seals thoroughly enough that you can turn it upside down and shake it and not a drop escapes, so no worries about spilling coffee on my legs from going over bumps. And the unsealing mechanism is a button that's easy to press, allowing for no-hassle one-handed operation. Can even manage to drink with rough ground, since I can press the unseal button after getting the coffee 

The first thing to do is find the local bike shops (preferably locally owned, not large multinational chains) and look around and ask around there. Try to check multiple shops, not just the first one you find, since they may specialize and you may find some easier to work with. Try chatting with the staff; if they don't carry what you're looking for they may know who does or be able to order it. Since I don't speak Portuguese (or Spanish), it's difficult to see which bicycle companies distribute widely in your country. When I can figure out which ones have some kind of distribution into the general area, it doesn't necessarily mean that specific models make it into the country or into the local shop. All the major bicycle manufacturers make "women's" bicycles with a step-through frame, fewer of them make ones that are a true "mixte", however. But here's a few attempts at mixtes that may be available in Portugal: 

So as a pedestrian going uphill on a narrow path, the cyclists were supposed to yield to you. However, if you looked like you were stepping off the trail, they probably assumed you wanted to let them pass. Yield means something like: slow down to the hiker's speed, and if needed pull to the side and let the hiker pass, and depending on conditions would likely mean needing to stop entirely. See also: 

You could always get a seat for one in front of you (handlebar mounted child seat) and the second behind you (conventional rack-mount child seat). Probably have to have them trade off to minimize fights, since the front seat is probably a lot more fun (and easier to watch the kid). I see a couple around town where the wife carries their kid in a handlebar mounted seat that looks just like that one. Or you could get an Xtracycle and get the "peapod" accessory to put two kids on the back of your now-longtailed bike. There's probably similar options for other longtailed bikes, or simply seats that you can mount two of two a longtailed bike... Here's a Kona Ute with two peapods on the back: You should check the age, though... I understand that you want to wait until a couple of months after the child can hold their own head up (the helmet makes it even harder on the child's neck, but small children really need to be wearing a helmet). Something like 9 months? Or maybe find a seat arrangement that has the kid laying down instead of sitting upright. For a solution that's compatible with a tag-along bike, you probably need something that puts both kids in front of you. A bakfiet's probably way too expensive, though. I see lots of parents carrying kids on bikes, but only ever a single kid on the bike, if there's 2 or more kids, all the others are in a trailer, on a trail-a-bike or on the other parent's bike. Disclaimer: I don't have kids and have never tried to carry even one on a bike. Closest I've ever come is either a lot of groceries on the bike or an adult on a trailer. 

It's very unlikely that your brake levers can be modified to increase the diameter enough to handle the change from 22.2mm to 23.8mm. The brake clamps just aren't adjustable like that, typically. Where on the handlebars were you thinking to mount the brake levers? If you were thinking at the middle (next to the stem), then you're likely in the area where the handlebar is wider (the "clamp diameter") which is even worse. One option is going with "trekking" (aka "butterfly") handlebars. These are typically the same diameter as straight bars and can easily accomodate the same brake/shift levers. They look a little funny, but do give you more handlebar positions similar to what drop bars do. Or just add bar ends to your existing bars. The right bar ends can give you a comfortable sideways hand position similar to the main hand position people use on drop bars. Another thing to consider is handlebar positions on the drop bars. Typically the position people use most often is on the brake hoods. Brake levers made for drop bars tend to have comfortably shaped hoods with a little bit of give in them. Brake levers made for flat handlebars don't generally have a comfortable place to rest your hand. If you do decide to switch your brake levers, be aware that the amount of pull is likely different so you'll either have to be careful with which brakes you get or do something to accomodate the difference. Here's a nice article that includes more details about changing to drop bars: $URL$
