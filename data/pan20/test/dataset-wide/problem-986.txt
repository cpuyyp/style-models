I understand the process of volcanism and the reason for magma deposition on the surface of the earth. What is not clear to me, or what seems to be less well explained is why eruptions occur and then stop. What is the operative cause or causes of a flow to start or stop? As far as my understanding goes there would seem to be two possible obvious explanations: (1) The magma rises in bubbles, like a lava lamp, through the earth, so the flow begins when the bubble reaches the surface and stops when the bubble is exhausted. (2) The magma rises as a constant stream, but causes earth to build up around the stream, eventually snuffing it out by mass accumulation. In this explanation, the lava constantly searches for thin spots where it erupts until it blocks itself off, then the pressure forces its way through some new location. Are either or both of these explanations correct or incorrect? Is there a mechanism I have not considered? 

Is there any way to get barometric time series for regions of the United States? I know that barometric maps are widely available, but in my case I want to see a time series for one region. However, I have not found any comprehensive source for weather time series data including pressure readings. Does that exist? 

To complement @MarkRovetta answer, McLoughlin & Grosch reported this year during EGU findings of carbonaceous fragments that they think are biogenic in the 3.4 Ga Buck Reef Chert. Chemical tests are still ongoing however. Schopf (2006) in his review of archean life reported a dozen of fossils in the 3 to 3.5Ga range. They are all "putative" fossil, however the biogenicity of the fossils he reports from the 2 to 3Ga range are frankly unquestionable. 

From reading the literature on the subject, my impression is that we don't know that much on the subject, primarily due to a scarcity of measurements. My understanding is that the first and only year-long time-series was made at the Drake Passage in 1979 (e. g. Whitworth & Peterson, 1985) by the ISOS programme (International Southern Ocean Studies). In addition to that NOAA's WOCE (World Ocean Circulation Experiment) added yearly data from 1990 to 2002. According to Rintoul & Sokolov 2001 and Rintoul et al. 2001, most of the variability south of Tasmania is due to changes in currents north of the ACC itself. Cunningham et al. 2003 show that the moderate interannual variation in baroclinic transport they observed seem to be coeval with variations in the location of the Polar Front (it moves north or south on a 90km range). But overall the variability seems to be relatively low, and the ACC relatively steady. White & Peterson, 1996 showed an interesting phenomenon that they called the Antarctic Circumpolar Wave: it is a "wave" in the ACC circling the globe in ca. 8 yrs with a period of 4yrs at any location and it is defined by anomalies in sea-suface temperature, sea-level pressure and sea-ice extent. However no evidence for corresponding anomalies in volume transport was showed, to my knowledge. So, to summarize, as far as I can see: 

Add a heat sink. A heat sink is an absorber of heat. So add co2, or dry ice as we usually call it. It is an excellent heat sink. 

I have made a modified blackbody model that predict earth temperature distribution with high accuracy. It doesn´t include mass or gases. It is based on the initial thought that all energy above surface is solar heat, and heat transfer must apply to the system. Just some simple modification to the perfect blackbody surprisingly enough gave very accurate results. I answered a question with these equations, but a moderator deleted it for unknown reasons. It is only numbers, and no speculation, so I really can´t understand why. The greenhouse effect uses The Stefan-Boltzmann equation to add fluxes, stacking them, and that is not allowed in thermal physics. It is a balance equation and should only be used for "net" transfer. I show why it is wrong to use an average value of solar irradiation over the whole surface area, it is because intensity is instantaneous. You cannot use average, because that means that the sun would only be ~5C. Or -18C depending on what solar average you use. Solar heat is about 105Celsius at TOA, that makes a big difference. I show how surface temperature and atmosphere temperature distribution is connected to the solar constant all the way. It is not shown here, but the model also show direct and total irradiation at zenith, with accuracy. Anyway, since it was deleted without explanation, I get the feeling of censorship, since it falsifies the greenhouse effect. Now I ask you. What is wrong with it?: I use Stefan-Boltzmann equation and temperature. Solar heat is absorbed according to the geometric difference between the blackbody and earth, two volumes with shells. $TSI/(4/3^2)$. And since only half the surface area is irradiated, $(1/2∗TSI)/(4/3^2)=383W/m^2$ or 286.7 Kelvin. The effective temperature is found by heat transfer to the surface and inverse square law, $1/4∗(TSI−((1/2∗TSI)/(4/3^2)))=244W/m^2$, or 256 Kelvin. Tropopause temperature: $((1/2∗TSI)/(4/3^2))−(1/4∗(TSI−((1/2∗TSI)/(4/3^2)))=138W/m^2$ or 222 Kelvin. As you can see, heat dominates everything, and just modifying the blackbody to observed differences, absorption in depth of a volume + irradiation of only half the surface, gives a accurate distribution of temperature. The numbers are, from my POV, unquestionable. Such a good fit falsifies the greenhouse immediately, especially since no experiments show the effect where cold gas can increase the intensity of the heat source heating it, which the theory claims. So, what are your opinions? 

Mass extinctions are selective: not all living organisms will be affected by it to the same extent. Meaning also that various groups will recover from it at various speed: a group from which half of the species were exterminated by the event will most probably take longer to recover (i. e. reach its pre-event diversity) than a group for which only 10% of the species are gone. And a group for which 95% of the diversity is gone is likely to never fully recover its initial diversity. If you are looking at the recovery of the ecosystem/biome as a whole, then what is likely to happen is that the extinct species left whole ecological niches vacant, meaning that this vacuum is likely to be quickly filled by new species (either species group that already existed and were already occupying this ecospace but were dominated by the now-extinct species or brand new species group). On that subject, one has to realise also that the recovery of a trophic level of an ecosystem is dependent on the recovery of the others (i. e. and to simplify, recovery of apex predators depends of the recovery of grazers, which depends on the recovery of primary producers etc.), so a mass extinction affecting primarily the primary producers might need longer to recover than one affecting mainly the apex predators. So is 10 Myr a short amount of time to recover from a mass extinction? I'll say that one would expect ecological recovery to be faster than that (see for instance the speed at which milieux disturbed by glacial episodes recover during interglacials, or the speed at which new islands get colonised). But for the complete recovery of global diversity (in particular for an event supposedly wiping out 90% of life diversity) i'd have expected it to take longer than 10 Myr. In the second article you link, the authors estimate that the recovery of the terrestrial ecosystem is fast by comparison with how long it took to colonise the land in the first place (i. e. 100 Myrs). But all the evolutionary adaptations needed to function on land do not need to be re-evolved, so it seems rational to expect it to take a shorter time than those 100 Myrs... Otherwise the probable reason the news article you linked considered it to be a long recovery time was to emphasise the fact that the article show that it took longer because of ripple effects of the Permo-Triassic event during the early Triassic that slowed down the recovery. In a review of mass extinction recovery predating those two articles, Erwin (1998) estimated the duration of the recovery from the End Ordovician, Frasian-Fammenian, end-Permian, end-Triassic and K/T extinction events (I mention here only the so-called "Big Five" extinctions) to, respectively, 7, 3, "3 to 9?", 3 and 2 millions years. With those number in mind, then indeed 10 Myrs is a long recovery. The same article also had this to say about the definition of mass extinction recovery:
