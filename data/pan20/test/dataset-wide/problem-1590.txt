In the second part of the study, they did the same experiment in Vancouver, where the asian stereotype is less prevalent with a total of 19 Asian-American female high school students. They state that 

However, they reported that the ethnicity-salient group had more problems to concentrate and conclude 

Note, that in this study there was no mentioning of European men. While there are indications, that a comparison against another gender/ethnicity may invoke a stereotype threat, this was not studied directly. In Competition in stereotyped domains: Competition, social comparison, and stereotype threat by Van Loo et al. evidence for a link between competition and the stereotype threat effect was found. Finally note, that the numbers Fry stated do not fit the numbers from the study. The criticism Study design In both experiments the number of participants was very small (n=46 and n=19), which raises questions about the study's reliability. Replication issues In a follow-up study WHEN POSITIVE STEREOTYPES THREATEN INTELLECTUAL PERFORMANCE: The Psychological Hazards of “Model Minority” Status by Cheryan and Bodenhausen they failed to reproduce the effect (again, with a very small sample size, n=49). 

tl;dr; There are indications for this effect, but the research is still unconclusive. The claim as stated is probably false. The evidence This statement refers to the widely studied Stereotype threat effect, which is often described as the risk of conforming to stereotypes of one's social group. In particular, it refers to the study STEREOTYPE SUSCEPTIBILITY: Identity Salience and Shifts in Quantitative Performance by Shih et al. In this study they tested the math performance of 46 Asian-American women, divided into three groups. The first group (n=14) was primed with questions about their female identity, the second (n=16) with questions about their Asian identity and the third (n=16) with neutral questions. They found that 

Is it realistic to suppose an alien civilisation 60 light-years away could now be receiving tv transmissions of "I Love Lucy"? This site says emphatically not, but my brother say ET could easily do it if he wanted to. Please settle the argument, somebody! ADDED 11th July: Just to clarify, my brother is prepared to assume ET's detection facilities could be incredibly good (i.e. - receiver array as wide as a planet or larger, focussed exactly on the earth), and almost infinite processing power to separate signal from noise. In short, the question comes down to whether there's some upper limit on how close ET would need to be, before 'background noise' would overwhelm any feasible attempt at detection. I don't know enough about information theory to even know whether such a limit can be proven to exist, let alone whether it can be calculated to an actual value. 

As others have pointed out, birds certainly wouldn't be likely to use their sense of smell to identify and reject a replaced fledgling. Luckily for cuckoos! As a general principle you shouldn't interfere with the natural process. That fledgling may be defective in some way. Maybe it's too stupid or too adventurous to stay safely in the nest. Maybe it's diseased and the parent recognises this in some way. This link might not put the position as strongly as I would, but it leans in the same direction. It doesn't really matter. The point is if you save that potentially unfit animal, it may grow up and mate. Possibly leading to more defectives that otherwise wouldn't have been born. Possibly depriving some other fit bird from getting the chance to mate. Nature got along fine for billions of years without human intervention, and much of the current evidence (such as Tire Reef and just about everything in New Zealand) suggests that when we do intervene, we often mess things up anyway. Grit your teeth and let Nature take its course. 

Conclusion While there are some indications that the claim might be true, it is still unconclusive if and to what extent the specific claim about Asian females or even the underlying Stereotype threat effect exists. Since the numbers stated by Fry do not match any results from the studies, it is likely that he invented those numbers to underline his point. Also there does not seem to be direct evidence regarding the claim that Asian women are affected by a stereotype threat due to competition with European men. There is weak evidence that Asian women perform worse when confronted with the "female" stereotype, than when confronted with the "Asian" stereotype, but these results fail to consistently reproduce. So given its level of precision, the claim is almost certainly fabricated. Additionally, what studies there are suggest that any effect in that direction is weaker than the claim pretends, and certain difficulties in replication imply that there might be not much, if any, such effect at all. 

More a comment, than an answer: The claims made in "Die Akte Aluminium" were thoroughly debunked by German skeptics, e.g. in this post of the GWUP. Regarding your explicit questions: I am not sure which evidence you are expecting if you don't trust a renowned scientific institution like the Paul-Ehrlich-Institut. Especially when all of the studies are linked in the article you mentioned. The study mentioned where they feeded mice aluminium and sucralfate seems to be this one. They indeed find evidence, that aluminium in its pure form can encourage (not cause!) allergies. But, as the PEI describes, further research showed that this is only applicable for low antigen concentration and the results cannot be transferred directly from mice to humans. 

In The Runaway Brain by Christopher Wills, the author illustrates the fact that ostriches aren't too bright by saying that an ostrich has been recorded as getting tangled in the fork of a tree, panicking, and pulling off its own head. Is there any evidence to back this up? Is it even plausible? 

As others have said, much depends on your definition of "a word". The 250,000+ "words" in Collins Official Scrabble Words, probably represent a little over 100,000 "base words", with the rest accounted for by a small set of standard regular inflections. OSW doesn't include "uninflected" words of 10 letters or more - but although English includes a lot of these, they're mostly compound words that can be understood by deconstruction into meaningful sub-components. Sticking to "base words", my understanding is you only need about 3000 to get by in terms of being able to express yourself without great difficulty, but even relatively illiterate people probably have more than twice that number at their disposal, so you'd often have difficulty understanding others' speech or writing with such a poor vocabulary. I think the average person probably has a productive/expressive vocabulary (words they're likely to actually use) of 15-20,000 words, with a receptive/listening vocabulary (words they would understand, but not normally say/write) at least half as big again. 

I can't resist adding that about 20 years ago I was commissioned by Roger Prebble (then managing editor of a major UK puzzle publishing company) to write crossword-generating software. He'd previously compiled a number of "word list" books published by Chambers, and as a goodwill gesture they'd allowed him free use of an electronic copy of Official Scrabble Words (UK rights to which they owned at the time). Roger initially thought that being able to incorporate the OSW list into my program would be a major help. In the event, we soon realised that most of the words were so obscure they could never be used. He and a few others with exceptionally wide vocabularies had to spend many, many hours leafing through the list deleting anything they'd never heard of. Even of the 80,000 that remained after this savage cull, more than half were flagged as "very difficult", and not to be used by my program for "ordinary" puzzles. As far as I recall, we only marked about 10,000 as "well-known enough to be used in any crossword puzzle". Just to put some context on that, bear in mind that most people who do crosswords at any level probably tend to have at least an "average" vocabulary, or they'd soon get frustrated and give up the pastime.
