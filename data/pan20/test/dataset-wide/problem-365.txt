Historically, it has often been the other way around: the land is named after the people. Hence the large number of countries whose names end in -land or -stan. To answer your question, 

In a worldbuilding context, you have to think about what you’re trying to symbolize with your flag, and about the design tradition in which it resides. Does it come from an older aesthetic tradition, such as heraldry? If so, what does heraldry look like in your world? In our world, tricolours have a specific meaning. A tricolour means this country is a Republic. There are other traditions in flag design, such as the pan-African colours seen in many (but not all) African national flags. Similarly, you might be better off not designing one flag, but designing a family of flags, in conversation with each other. Work out their histories, and which came first. Flags change, as a result of governmental changes. Many national symbols started out as family or personal symbols of a ruler. When there’s a revolution or coup, the symbols can change (or can merge). 

So when a message is sent and intercepted, the people trying to crack it have as much as two weeks to do so to enable them to reuse the key information to decipher following message. And breaking the cipher is not a major issue (tedious, time consuming perhaps, but not a problem if you want to do it). And they do not need to know the book or key to decipher the message if you allow the algorithm to do so to be known. The Book Cipher Problem This is a weakness. It won't be long before your enemies figure out which book to use. Which brings us to the problem of how people know which word to use on a given day. There are only two options : 

A change in writing style is most easily explained by a change in language. If, perhaps due to some virus, the prevalence of deafness in the population massively increased, culture might change to one like Matha's Vineyard in the 18th to mid 20th centuries, where everyone, hearing and Deaf, used a sign language. Sign languages are not commonly written, but when they are, they are written vertically, in Sutton SignWriting. As the use of sign languages became more prevalent, they would probably be written more. Spoken languages would not disappear, of course, but as people became used to writing vertically, they might start writing their spoken languages that way too. 

First things first, anything that big will likely become a Sun. That is to say it is unavoidable that gravitational forces will result in it becoming a more compact body. If there is enough mass it will result in fusion taking place in the core. The physics for this (and you wanted a reality check) is absolutely unavoidable. So they can't exist. Note that the leap from these Leviathan's (about $7$ km in size) to something Sun sized (a little short of $700,000$ km in radius) is vast. An object 7km in radius which was hollow with a shell $0.5$ km thick made of something the density of water would have a mass of about $2.9\times 10^{14}$ kg. An object as large as the Sun with a similar shell would have a mass of about $3\times 10^{24}$ kg, which is about half the mass of the Earth ! And that's for an empty (!) entity as you describe it. It would end up as a planet - there's no practical way around this. 

You need to look at sign languages, which have non-linear elements and and have a somewhat tighter relationship between morphemes and phonemes than is found in spoken languages. If you were signing the bus went past me, you would make the sign for bus and then hold your hand in the “vehicle classifier” handshape, then with the other hand make the sign for me (probably pointing at yourself), then hold that hand in the “person classifier” handshape, then bring the vehicle past the person. (Example drawn from Irish Sign Language, of which I have slight knowledge.) The grammatical structure of the language is, as you can see, fundamentally non-linear: goes past me is all one action, made with two classifiers (handshapes which represent categories of objects (vehicles, people)), with the specific meanings of those classifiers (“bus”, “me”) established beforehand. (There is no indication of either tense or aspect in this little example, because I don’t know enough about ISL grammar to describe how they should be indicated; however, they are not necessary for my point.) Sign languages are perfectly capable of abstract expression, including philosophy and mathematics (inasmuch as any non-written language is capable of mathematics*). In English, phonemes can have inherent meaning: gl- usually means something to do with sight, as in glare, glint, gleam, glitter, glossy, glaze, glance, glimmer, glimpse, and glisten (or not, as in gladiator, glucose, glory, glycerine, and globe).** This sort of thing is usually obscure and not very obvious: most phonemes (sound units) in the language have no inherent meaning; morphemes (meaning units) tend to be multi-phonemic. In sign languages, the two tend to be closer: many morphemes are a single phoneme (hand shape, movement, touch, etc.). Iconicity (onomatopoeia) is to some extent a feature of all languages, sometimes quite abstract (see the bouba/kikki effect), and sometimes obvious (Wikipedia gives hiccup, zoom, bang, beep, moo, and splash as examples of onomatopoeia in English). There is some evidence that sign languages have a higher degree of iconicity than spoken languages, but by no means is everything iconic. Signs that were once iconic can be simplified down to basic elements such that iconicity is no longer apparent. Or the sign for light may be based on holding a candle. Or the sign may not be iconic at all (in ISL, the sign for day involves putting one hand on the chest and moving the other hand (in the shape of a clenched fist) down past it). Plenty of discourse markers are given on the face: raised or furrowed eyebrows, for example, or puffed cheeks, or direction of eye-gaze. And these may be held over the full length of a phrase (providing further example that sign languages are less linear in nature than are spoken languages). 

In addition to some of the very good suggestions here are some overlooked items that would also be of high value in a near post-apocalyptic society: Iodised salt - useful for bartering, preservation, flavouring, sterilisation, curing, and nutrition. Sugar, tea and coffee - historically these have been highly desirable items in pre modern western societies (eg colonial America) and would be useful for bartering, flavouring or nutrition. Anti-diarrhoea medication and worming tablets - diarrhoea is a major killer in third world countries, and worms another major problem. Birth control pills - would be extremely valuable in a world where pregnancy is suddenly a lot more dangerous or undesirable. Tampons / pads - not just convenient, but potentially life saving for women, and can substitute as bandages as well. Sex education literature that is sex-positive and feminist - every teenager needs a proper sex educated! Imagine how much scarier and deranged sexuality is likely to be in a violent post apocalyptic society, A traumatised world is unlikely to spontaneously become a kinder more egalitarian one left to its own. Books - require no technology to operate and preserve extremely well. Tomes should cover foundational topics including organic gardening and permaculture, bush survival skills, human anatomy, medicine, first aid, cooking basics, some highly valuable crafts (like carpentry, sewing, and leatherwork) general science books, general encyclopaedias, some history books, books on psychology covering trauma, group dynamics, and negotiation, general philosophy and law books. An atlas and maps - seems self evident. Some contemporary news magazines or newspapers to preserve the truth of what was happening in the lead up to events for future generations, Paper, blank journals or notebooks, pencils and stationary including a compass and slide ruler - for note taking, documentation, and problem solving. Family memorabilia - photos or family heirlooms to provide a sense of continuity and belonging for your children. And some additional tools to consider - first priority would be a pair of decent steel scissors; a thermometer, Swiss Army Knives, backpacks, shoulder bags, pencil cases (essentialy purses), pins, pedal-powered sewing machine, trowels, tweezers... 

One man's duty is another man's holocaust. Dogma is a problem and, again, who decides what's duty and what's unworthy personal obsession ? 

The only viable way is to destroy or circumvent the command and control system. Your soldiers are (ridiculously) hard to destroy, so they're simply not a viable target. Targeting them would be to attack the enemy at the strongest point, which is bad tactics. There is, by the way, a serious flaw with them : if you can't kill them, it will surely become apparent to the soldiers themselves that they should be giving orders, not taking them. What happens when they run out of "official" enemies ? These types aren't going to all retire to gardening and church socials, they're going to want to take over. You'd quite likely end up with a lot of warlords fighting endlessly with each other and rife with internal dissent. But they have to be controlled, or they're just useless grunts. Someone has to direct them in a strategic way : what do they do and who to. So you'd use covert or down-right sneaky methods to infiltrate and attack their communications. You'd ideally attack select senior commanders or the political leaders. You'd interfere with their lines of communications. And even if they are willing to die because they instantly get recreated whole, there's a difference between dying repeatedly by desperate enemies who have no option but to fight you, and being willing to suffer all that pain and misery for an endless battle. This is particularly the case when they split into factions and start internal battles. And note that because they are essentially invincible, they'll rapidly start to view everyone else as irrelevant, slaves at best, useless at worst. That's another problem : they're a warrior caste and the only worthy enemy for them is their own kind. Another possibility is that, as a warrior caste they actually develop an ethic that's it's dishonorable (or similar) to battle mortal opponents. That might limit their willingness to fight. Likewise, killing and being killed is a messy and emotionally exhausting business, even if you're invincible. Killing mortals is pointless - it's just easy - so will they suffer battle fatigue ? Even the best soldiers can suffer battle fatigue. Will they start asking questions like "why are we doing this ?". Maybe they will want to retire to more productive lives. In WW1 there was a notable instance where the exhausted (but still brave) French army went on strike for better conditions (which they got at some sacrificial cost). Would a peace movement break out ? There were many instances of front lines developing a live-and-let-live mentality : we won't bother you if you don't bother us. During the American Civil War there was a case where soldiers declined an opportunity to shoot at opposing officers in the distance (out inspecting their own lines) because they regarded it as murder. Would your soldiers start viewing killing mortals as plain old nasty murder and simply stop doing it ? Again, maybe you can "turn" them (or enough of them) with some cleverly directed propaganda. Maybe you'll convince some units will decide that defending mortals is more honorable than killing them. Maybe you'll convince them that you're no threat to them (and you're not) and they'll look for more challenging enemies (other immortals). Maybe you'll simply bribe them : we'll pay you more than the idiots you're working for now, wine, women, song. So there are ways to attack them, it's just that the weapons you need are not blades, but perhaps words. 

There’s been some great answers to this question, however there’s a few specifics that probably should have been initially clarified, starting with if these animals are living in an Earth analogue environment, what kinds of environment(s) they occupy, and if they are able to fly or glide. (Some avian species are unable to do either e.g. penguins). These questions aside, I’ll assume you’re imagining a humanoid species capable of flight in an Earthern world: I would actually argue that simply being occupied by a species capable of flight would have very little impact on the city. The defining characteristics of the city would have more to with the environment, economics, and the culture, than just anatomy. While flying is novel, it’s implications on the essential necessities of a Victorian Era industrialised city are very limited, therefore their cities are unlikely to look radically different. Transportation While flying (or rather gliding) is highly efficient for long distance travelling, the ability to transport large / heavy objects is acutely limited. Ground transportation would be an essential and integrated feature of the urban environment by necessity. A train or barge is the most efficient way to move tonnes of iron ore, regardless of wether you fly or walk on land. Aerotechnology however, would most likely be accelerated. Steam can’t effectively power aeroplanes, but it can be used by balloons and blimps, which would be superior methods for long distance air travel based on their ability to carry large payloads and travel at consistent minimum speeds. Gliders would be another option. Sciences including cartography, physics, meteorology, mathematics and engineering might also get a boost. Given they are probably going to be weaker than humans, technologies that allow these lighter bodies to use more leverage are most likely ubiquitous. Architecture Stairs, elevators, escalators etc. would all be common - imagine being expected to walk up and down the stairs in every skyscraper just because you have legs capable of doing so! Given vertical flight is all about hard flapping, it would seem less efficient to fly than to walk up and down inside a tall building. Either way, elevators and funiculars are still more practical than flying or walking steep or high points. Buildings most likely have stairs and handrails too as they need to be safe and accessible for the very young, the sick, the old and the disabled. Urban Layout It’s quite likely the city would be orientated to prevailing winds, and organised in such a way to provide access to those winds. Likewise if this species has some sense of the magnetic field the city may align to that as well, or instead. It’s no more reasonable to assume an avian species would live on cliff sides or in glorified nests, than it is to presume humans would naturally live amongst the tree branches just because their primate cousins do. Your question asks what impact the ability to fly would have on the nature of an industrialised city. I would argue that the ability of citizens to fly has little impact on the essential nature of an otherwise human city. The differences are more likely to be superficial, and reflect what is economically, technologically and culturally permissible - rather than being determined just by biology. Industrial cities need quite large, relatively flat, easily accessible and interconnected areas, so a cliff side city is probably unlikely. At the end of the day a blast furnace is a blast furnace, is a blast furnace. Socio-economics As mentioned elsewhere, it’s quite likely that damaging the ability of an individual to fly would probably be used as a severe punishment. One interesting thing to speculate about is how can avians be effectively coerced? Victorian industrialisation was a brutal, foul and miserable experience for the working class, prompting sabotage, strikes, and violence. If workers had the ability to fly far away quickly on a whim, would they suffer such harsh treatment? Perhaps there is an opening to imagine avian society as ring based on anarchist or consensus politics. Alternatively, perhaps the majority of the population are kept disciplined with forced clippings or pluckings for an airborne capitalist class living palacial towers. 

As I've pointed out, it's just as difficult to tell what's really going on inside the mind of all these condescending, ambitious people. It's fundamentally impossible to avoid this problem and still have any free will in a group. 

First things first. Black Dwarfs A black dwarf is a white dwarf that has cooled down to be in thermal equilibrium of the space around it. It's just a dense lump in thermal equilibrium with it's surroundings. Studying them is pointless if you have already studied white dwarfs because they're just cold white dwarfs - nothing to see here. So we can skip black dwarfs completely. White dwarfs A white dwarf can form from almost any star - that is, the vast majority of stars is the Milky Way will become white dwarfs. So these are "easy" to make and messing around with blue dwarfs as an intermediate stage is just pointless farting around. So we just grab any old main sequence star with a mass of no more than about 10 solar masses and fiddle with that to make a white dwarf, right ? Wrong. We've already found white dwarfs and why make one when there's already one made for you ? So we can happily skip the tedious make-your-own-white dwarf step too. So far, so trivial. :-) Red Dwarfs We've already got those so we can again skip the make-your-own stage. In fact we humans have one next door - Proxima Centauri. Maybe your aliens won't be so lucky, but they might even have one in the same system as they live in. So we're skipping that stage too. Leaving us with ... Blue Dwarfs These, as far as we know, do not yet exist. To "make" one you need a red dwarf of greater than 0.25 solar masses and not more than 0.35 solar masses (the upper limit for red dwarfs). You also need to wait until the red dwarf fuses basically all the Hydrogen in it's core. Then it starts to burn other nuclei and that's when it becomes blue. And to do this you just wait. A long time. Alternative. Start with a lot of helium - enough to make a blue dwarf core (I do not know how much that would be). Introduce it somewhere in "empty" space, ideally directing it towards a common central area. Add hydrogen ("lots") in a similar way when the central area is reasonably concentrated (but before fusion starts). This should increase the rate of collapse and if you add enough of the right materials you will get a helium core surrounded by a hydrogen body - more or less a blue dwarf. Fusion should start "normally" from gravitational pressure and you can monitor the whole thing to your heart's content. A few minor details. To do any of this (including visit existing distant white dwarfs) you need FTL drives. If you can build FTL drives you then have only the "minor" difficultly of being able to transport enough material to make a small star (about 0.25 solar masses of the stuff) to your test site to make your blue dwarf. The energy requirements for this would seem insane. However, if you can do all these things then a couple of really difficult problems remain :
