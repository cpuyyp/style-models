Garmin do not publish the firmware or provide support for community modifications, and actually seem to be killing off the one community feature they had allowed (the ability to use non Garmin maps) in some areas. My advice - buy another device for the other bike, or just accept that navigating through 5 menus isn't really that bad:-) 

This is what your bike is supposed to do. The direction you are pushing the wheel corresponds to your pedals pushing forwards. If this didn't happen you would not be able to pedal forwards! 

It is remarkably easy to flip over the front wheel (I have done this as a child and as an adult) but far more commonly what happens is that if there is a slight turn on the handlebars and the surface is at all slippy the front wheel will fire out sideways extremely rapidly and you find your face at ground level! I learned a lot of my control on a bicycle from motorcycling as a child, and a lot of the teaching is directly appropriate: 

In the winter I use Shimano MT60 MTB shoes - really comfy, gore-tex, warm and you can run cross-country in them with a bike on your shoulder. They were fine down to -20 Centigrade last winter. 

I use a pair of MTB SPD's on my road bike when I cycle to work - mostly so I can walk in them, but there is no way I would recommend them for wearing at work. 

My children are 5, 9 and 11 and as the eldest ones are reasonably proficient, my 5 year old has not been cycling very long so she is a bit erratic, so I tend to go with: Eldest in front - I know I can trust him to stop at junctions correctly. 9 year old next - she is good at cycling, but doesn't always pay attention, so having her brother stop at junctions in front of her helps a lot. 5 year old next, with me beside her so no matter how far she weaves she will not be the furthest out into the road. In an emergency I could also grab her or push her over onto the kerb (not ideal, but preferable to going under a car...) This also means I can see all three of them at all times. 

Having never had this happen, and having had one bike for over twenty years, I can only think that the pedal must never have been tightened up properly, so it was moving and wearing out - otherwise the pedal/crank connection is actually pretty solid. It is something that can be hard to tighten, especially as one thread is clockwise and one counterclockwise, which can confuse people. 

Clamps are easy and reversible - causing little or no damage to tubing (metal jubilee clips might scratch paintwork, but there are plastic versions which work well) I'm loath to drill holes in perfectly good tubing - I also would be worried about metal shavings falling to the bottom of the tube and causing problems in a bearing race. 

Even a new tube will deflate over time - it is incredibly difficult to fully seal the tube/valve perfectly so air will leak out, mostly around the valve seal. An older tube may well have worn rubber in the seal, around the edge of the valve stem where it joins the tube, or possibly the tube has worn thinner. All these will allow air to leak away. And the higher pressure your tyre is at, the faster it will lose pressure. With a brand new 90psi tube on my bike, I'd expect to have to pump it every week when I want to ride it. And that is with no holes, punctures or tears. 

I saw a bit of the Omnium racing televised this week, and while most of the events are straightforward, the Elimination race seems to require far deeper tactics than the others. This may be just because I have never taken part in one of these, but can anyone here explain how to approach an elimination race in the format used at the Olympics (ie a sprint every 2 laps, last one is eliminated)? My simplistic view suggests staying in the middle of the pack is key, but that's not how any of the races panned out, with wild breaks at seemingly random intervals. 

Some people will never get the chance to use the 11 teeth setting, whether this is through not being fit enough or another reason. So they can opt for the slightly longer expected lifespan of the 12 (lower wear per tooth) and the slightly narrower gap between ratios which can make gear changing less of a struggle. 

Another check not mentioned yet: The bearing in the head tube may have been bashed giving you a point which the handlebars prefer to remain in. I had this happen with an older bike and as this point was slightly off to one side, the handlebars would end up moving to that spot if I tried taking my hands off, which meant it could not be ridden hands free. The fix was to replace the bearing completely. 

There is a valve in the floor pump, yes, so it is supposed to press in the presta valve the whole time it is attached to it. I too have seen the problem you refer to in the comment on @Useless's answer - diagnosis has always shown this to be down to the presta valve either catching on the side of the pump fitting or just being stiff and refusing to budge. A simple solution I use is to give it a quick press with my finger before using the pump, just to ensure it moves cleanly and isn't stuck. 

Assuming you know your own body, the route and the climatic conditions very well we can try and rule out variations in these - however I would suggest that this sort of variation can be very dependent on conditions. Think we have a few questions on this, even including air temperature and pressure effects. If we do rule them out, a contributing factor can be the surface - cycle paths are often a different, rougher, surface than roads, and this can increase your rolling resistance considerably. Also, how close to the road route does the path follow? This could cause a difference, depending on your optimum power output and the gradients of the road and path. 

In addition to perhaps adjusting the height further, also have a look to see if the cleats are forcing your foot inwards or outwards. That can cause problems with knee or ankle if it isn't lined up with your natural axis. Some excerpts from bikesplit.com: 

With a racing bike I had many years ago I just increased the tension of the derailleur spring. This kept the chain length the same (so I didn't need to worry about any geometry changes making it harder to change gear) but increased the chain tension. Not quite the same as your MTB, as I obviously wasn't jumping off things so chain slap was not anywhere near as much of a problem, but you could look at that as a solution. 

Because the chain loads up unevenly on teeth on the bottom of the chain ring you get high friction, and the chain won't disengage properly from the teeth. First up - clean your chain and lubricate it properly. If the problem continues, the simplest fix is to replace the chain ring, but you could also get your teeth reprofiled to reduce the friction. 

With my older Shimano setup I found that as it aged I had to adjust the limit screws on the front derailleur to allow it to travel past the correct position because it would then settle back a couple of millimetres - probably most of the cause was old cables, but some was definitely just old/worn components in the derailleur itself allowing flex. As @bwalk2895 mentioned, it is an age thing - you can hold it off by tweaking (and in fact mine was much older and was still usable when I finally retired it for a new bike) but changing cables is relatively simple and should help a bit. 

I'm afraid that while I am very focused on safety I wouldn't pay anywhere near that. I am more concerned with bright front and back lights and wheel lights for side visibility. I'm less concerned with a light for signalling as with visibility. 

If this chain has been on it for nearly 9000 miles - I'd suggest a new one! You could shorten it, but the wear is on the link connectors, so the sapcing is going to be wider than it should be - thus wearing the sprockets! 

For a city commuter bike, don't bother with disk brakes - go for simple rim brakes. You'll want the reliability over all else. You don't need disks for most types of road cycling, as the limiting factor for grip is likely to be your tyre anyway. As regards shifters, go with whatever is comfortable for you. I like the combination of brakes and gear levers in the same unit, as you don't need to take your hands off the brakes to change gear. This is very useful in traffic. I would also recommend touring tyres - offroad tyres lose too much power through rolling resistance, but you want tyres wide enough that you have some comfort and puncture resistance. You could also look into self sealing tyres. 

I have only had the one eight speed, so my sample is not statistically significant, but it worked beautifully... Way better than my current 9 speed, which is clunky. Think you maybe just got a bad one. 

This will depend on what kind of bike you have, and what kind of riding you do. Are you a commuter? If so you may want a wide, padded seat, and a wide channel. If you are a sprint racer you may not need a channel at all, as you will be standing so you just want a narrow seat. At the end of the day, try some and see what is comfortable - everyone is different. Mine has a negligible channel, but the shape of the seat is such that my 16 mile commute to work is still comfortable. 

The jumping is either chain friction (ie the links are not moving smoothly against each other) or links catching on teeth. Fagan.co.za has a useful article on chain suck. To summarise his points, the most common causes of chain suck are: 

This is a bit of a subjective question, and at the end of the day you are best off trying a couple to compare, as you need to feel comfortable on it. The main difference is in technology - at the top end, dramatic improvements have been made in materials, bonding, flexibility, weight etc., and these do trickle down to consumer bikes. Spares for older bikes may also not be as available. If you are a normal, every day commuter, a well maintained bike from the 80's may be absolutely fine, but a more modern bike might be a bit lighter, a bit more able to soak up bumps, have better gearing system and this may make the difference if you are using it every day. 

If you have run your finger round the inside and outside and you haven't found it in the tire, and you have also checked it isn't in the beading, then it most likely fell out at some point - either while you were cycling, or when you removed the tire. 

The UCI regulations specify not a distance to be traveled but rather the distance remaining: no matter the length of the track, the pacer pulls off between 600 and 700 meters before the finish line. Thus, if the track is 250 meters long the pacer pulls off about 2.5 laps before the finish; if the track is 333 meters long the pacer pulls off 2 laps before the finish; and if the track is 400 meters long the pacer pulls off 1.5 laps before the finish.
