What would you do if you're an NPC and don't know any players? They are pretty rare after all. Well, you go and find plot hooks. In a GMed world, there should be plenty. The Players use them to find adventure after all. When you have found a plot hook, make sure that the area or person of interest is observed. You can expect the status quo to hold until a group of people comes along that disturbs it. It might be a coincidence, but you'll know soon enough if you have that particular group of people followed. They'll probably behave a little odd, and are inexplicable magnets to trouble. A word of warning: Follow them around long enough, and it's likely that they'll confront you or your spy, but fear not! As long as the adventures are grouped together, the consensus is probably that they won't kill you if you are good at heart. Just by following around the players you'll find plenty of support for your theory. Just remember that you'll never find any actual evidence. 

One of the issues you have raised is the weight of the weapons. I can imagine that the wooden weapons you have crafted yourself are quite heavy. That's mainly because the wooden weapons are solid. Steel weapons would be partially hollow, but steel is still rather heavy. If construction materials and money are not an issue, which is often the case with legendary weapons such as theses, you have plenty more to choose from. The aerospace sector is always looking for ways to reduce weight on their air- and spacecraft and have done so pretty successfully. Grade 5 titanium alloys are looking good. There are materials available with even better specific strength (strength of a material normalized to its density), but unsuitable for the part of the weapon that you strike with (or may get struck). That's ok for the grip though, and the same is true for the area facing the user. You could fashion those parts out of even lighter material if necessary. The fourth issue you listed is actually the key to using the weapon. You mentioned that you can't effectively use the blade without spinning around. Best is to let go of the notion that the weapons can be used in any way similar to a sword. Spinning around (with stretched arms, each holding a glaive) is exactly what you should do. Your arm will only have to worry about providing a pulling force. Combined with the centrifugal force, the weapon will automatically move towards a horizontal place. Counteracting the gravity is done with the same pulling force that you're using to keep the weapon in place. Just make sure you keep gripping the glaive and don't send it flying. Compared to swinging a sword, the latter is rather easy, as you're doing much more with a sword than simply gripping it. For glaives, you don't have to steer the weapons and your arms are not used for the slashing motion, you do that with the rest of your body. Using only a single glaive will throw you off balance. Always use both glaives, or adopt a different fighting style entirely. For glaives to work this way, aerodynamics are rather important. While it's slicing through the air, the shape of the weapon may causes forces to act on the weapon that disturbs the circular motion of the weapon. What you want is for the glave to automatically stabilize itself when its not held perfectly flat. Most aircraft are designed that way as well. For example, holding the glaive slightly in front of the center of gravity (with respect to the spinning direction) will makes the blade more stable, in the same way that pulling a pen is more stable than pushing a pen across a table is. Instead of moving the location of the grip, you could also make the trailing part of the glaive a bit heavier than the leading part. I think the question of how to make a glaive to be more like an airplane is a question best saved for a different topic though (and left to experts). Now we have the mental image of a whirlwind made of deadly metal, but I am afraid that won't last. You see, there's a slight problem with this setup. If you spin a few times, chances are you're getting dizzy already. Your opponent just has to keep doding your attacks and at some point you will simply fall on your face. This doesn't seem like a very effective fighting style at all! This is where ballerina's come in! They have been spinning on their feet longer than the concept of a glaive has been around (I think). While they haven't found a magic cure, they are living proof that dizziness doesn't need to be an obstacle. They use a technique where they fix their eyes on a fixed point and snap their head around while turning. For figure skaters on the other hand, that's not much of an option, as that would put too much stress on the neck. Their solution? Train, train and train some more. They ignore it. Apparently they can get pretty good at hiding they suffer from dizziness, although they still do. ...better replace that image we had with Illidan as a ballerina. Martial artists have been trying to prove their art is the best one ever since we picked up clubs, so I think it is rather pointless to try and prove here that it is at least somewhat effective. I can you tell you this though: Your enemies will soil their pants the first time they see one of you whirling their way. I'm sure some commentators can enlighten us on viable strategies to defend against glaives, but except for the obvious ranged weapons, those strategies are tested literally with the user's life on the line. If that doesn't make them flinch, I suppose it is well deserved if they can prove themselves right. The same goes the other way though, we don't have grandmaster glaive-wielders yet who can teach us the best techniques and glaive designs. Even if glaives don't prove to be on par with other martial arts, I think I can safely say that in the event of a zombie apocalypse, glaives are looking pretty damn effective for getting around town. 

So, basically you are asking why smooth, conductive surfaces would be good catalysts for magic? First I should mention that the surface of modern mirrors is made of glass, which has poor conductivity. Keep that in mind when designing your mirrors. Perhaps you could use this to explain why some mirrors are useful, while some aren't. As for the answer, if magic were to be special subtype of electricity, that would explain the benefit of conductivity. The smoothness of the surface would then also be beneficial, as rough surfaces don't conduct electricity as well when making contact. 

Proving the existence of a GM is not possible, unless that's what the GM wants. The cult can, however, make it somewhat plausible that a GM exists. The thing with GMs is, they may have the power of gods, but they still have the personality of a human. I invite you to look around on the internet for GM horror stories. There are plenty about, for example, powerplayers that drive the GM crazy, players that keep bending the rules, players that enrage a GM by doing stupid things, and there plenty about horrible GMs doing similar things as well. Bottomline is, as a player, it is fairly easy to trigger a GM response. A player could try some of the following: 

Being productive doesn't have to mean that you're in a position to hurt yourself. An extreme example might be where prisoners are restraint in such a manner that all they can do is use a keyboard connected to a computer. The prisoners can do virtually anything with the right software installed on their machines. There are also other ways you can profit from the prisoners, even if they aren't actively exerting themselves. For example, depending on the value of blood in your world, the prison may just be worth the cost if you force them to donate blood on a regular basis. Alternatively, the immortal prisoners could be used as test subjects for experimental drugs. Since there is even a small chance of dying, regular humans could even rationalize the behavior by pretending they are doing them a favor. 

Warglaives are awesome. While not as versatile as a sword, they have a use: The massacre of demons ('demon' can be interpreted liberally here). Warning: Do not try this at home! Disclaimer: This is 100% theorycraft. I have exactly zero experience wielding glaives (unless... does playing Illidan in Warcraft 3 count?). 

Even supposing that it were possible, I realize that the necessary conditions would not occur naturally. By including the context of the god, I wanted to make clear that this is not a problem for me. For example, if the answer to the question requires a perfectly spherical planet made out of solid plutonium, that's what you'll get to work with. However, except for the fact that it doesn't matter where to get the materials, or how to apply or shape them, I (as in, the human being behind the computer that is writing the question) am still only interested in scenario's that make sense according to our current understanding of physics. The radiation emitted by the planet made out of plutonium should still kill every organism nearly instantly, irrespective of whether or not the godlike entity has the power to magically handwave the radiation poisoning away. I have included the additional story-specific elements, because it might provide some insight in how useful specific answers are, or how I determine the most acceptable answer. If any of the story-specific elements are confusing, feel free to ignore them. Also note that if the god does decide to make the laws of nature different from how we model them, than the ramifications of such alterations are best discussed in another topic. 

Edit: It seems mentioning the godlike entity has distracted from the real question, which is exactly as stated: 

Suppose that a god has created a universe with nothing in it, except for a single, solitary celestial body. For simplicity, I'll call it a planet, although it most probably technically won't be. For instance, it isn't orbiting anything, because there's nothing to orbit in this particular universe. Would it be possible for that planet to support sustainable humanoid life? I was also wondering what the observable effects are of a profound lack of matter in the universe. For example, would it matter for an observer on or below the surface of the planet that there is no cosmic radiation (assuming that there is, indeed, none)? 

I think blind people are severely underestimated here. It's true that being blind is a huge disadvantage in our society, but that's only because everything we build is made with the target audience of two-eyed humans. Which of course, we did because we use our eyes all the time, even for things where they are not the best tool. Among other things, eyes are slow and suffer from tunnel vision. A very simple example: traffic lights. You have to stare at them, and keep staring at them. In some cases for minutes. And they expect you to react right away when they turn green. (Some countries have fixed the latter by lighting up orange before switching to green though) The traffic signals for blind people are not as widespread, but when they are available, you'll notice that they are much more user friendly than their visible counterparts, even for people that aren't blind. I think the assumption that blind people could not create advanced technologically is false. Blind people tend to take a backseat in our society, but when everyone is blind, we are not collectively going to sit on hour hands. We are certainly not going to wait for a predator to pick us off one by one. It's our ears that will safe our skin. Compared to those, lack of eyesight is a minor disadvantage. We create tools that offset our weaknesses. We make spears, because we have no natural weapons. I'm sure we can come up with something that prevents us from running into trees. It's true that no amount of tools will help someone from present day society if he has just lost his eyes, but if a species never had eyes to begin with, they wouldn't be nearly as helpless. As for computers, I don't think it is much of a stretch either that we would have invented it by now. They wouldn't have evolved into machines with displays for output, sure, but thats hardly the only way we can interact with them. These days, even computers with displays have support for blind people. See screen readers and the Web Accessibility Initiative (a standard for websites to enable the use of voice interaction, etc). Remember that while those are crutches, they are only necessary because we didn't design computers for blind people right from the start. Besides, why would eyesight be required to create a machine that does calculations for you? Because of the details involved? Considering how huge the first computers were, I sincerely doubt that we couldn't take the same approach of starting big and miniaturize when we get more comfortable in the field. Books would probably be produced earlier if we had been blind. Putting ink on paper in seemingly arbitrary patterns, is rather complicated compared to punching holes in a rectangular grid. As for space travel. There's as much incentive for blind people to explore as there is for people with eyesight. Blind people, too, will wonder what's above their heads and beyond the water. In fact, they might have been even more curious than we are. Without eyesight, a vast, empty ocean is more of a mystery. The majority of space is not observed with human eyes, by the way. Many of the pictures you see from space agencies like NASA are not even 'just close-up views'. The colors used are simply made up, because the observed phenomenon usually have nothing to do with visible (colored) light. We made tools for observering the stars, because our eyes are inadequate to make any meaningful observations. Well, we can take note of the location of stars, and how the moon is lit at this time of the month, but that's about it. We cannot even look straight at the sun! If we're making tools for stellar observation anyway, and we build computers that interact with us in a non-visual way, then we'd make the same progress as we do now. So, how would a blind species reach the stars? The same way we did, with passion and the occasional flash of brilliance.
