There are many disasters that would take humanity "off-line" and machines surely can help mitigate or totally prevent them. 

Thus, theism posits that god[s] is/are affecting our world by their actions. We may consider that those actions are not responces to what is happening in our world. In other words, those actions are independent on our world. This means that either god[s] is/are deterministic or all their actions in our world are occasional. If we accept that those actions are responces to what is happening in our world, we must accept that these actions are parts of interactions between our world and god[s]. 

You presuppose one thing here. You say being/existence come into it. But what is the ground behind it? From my point the question itself is not valid. Our mind and, probably, universe is constrained by some rules. And you may understand these constraints by looking the difference between our language and our thoughts. Our languages has a hugr amount of words and there are dictionaries showing their meaning. But then, let we look for definition of "definition". We will use the words used there, look for their definition and so on up until infinity. This problem may be solved only if we have some basis, words that do not require definition. But how do we understand their meaning? Through common sense, of course. Now you may see that language is much less expressive and more constrained than our mind. But our minds themselves are costrained. We think in yes/no logic. We use notions to think. But like language is weaker than mind, our mind is weaker than what you call "existence". And it may turn out so that our logic does not work for the whole existence. You may see analogy in mathematics. Mathematics uses some axioms (constraints) to work. It is said without constraints it is nothing to think of. And same might apply to existence. For sure, there are no reasons to say everything has constraints. Thus, constraints are not universal and our words, our notions and logic do not apply there. But if so, we cannot say anything about unconstrained part of existence. We cannot even call it somehow. And can't say it comes into itself. So, your mistake is to apply our constrained logic to unconstrained. And your question loses it's senses. 

Given your reply to #4, I'd label you as a person regardless of your personal feelings on the matter. You can call yourself a dog, a duck, or the Queen of England if you like, but being 99.99999999997% human means the 'human' label is most appropriate in my assessment. I wouldn't mind also supporting your claim to the dog label. You obviously feel it applies to you, and having been born a dog does support it. 

tl;dr - Scientific knowledge is concerned with how the world works now, and reliably predicting how it will operate in the future. Religious knowledge assumes the existence of a some manner of greater being, and is focused on determining/acting according to it's will. When we have reached the limits of our (current) scientific knowledge, people often rely upon Religious knowledge rather than saying, "I don't know." 

Humans tend to track time in a cyclical manner (clocks, seasons, calendars, etc) because that is how we experience it. The earth spins around the sun in a stable orbit, causing our environment oscillate through a predictable pattern of environmental states. And people are really good at identifying patterns. But that is just our earth-bound perspective, biased heavily by our position on a spinning, wobbly rock. A society living on non-orbiting rogue planet would likely have a very different view of the passage of time, and I doubt it would resemble our cyclical time/date keeping devices. (tl;dr, our way of measuring time has little to do what time actually "is," as opposed to our perspective of it. Whether time is a block or a parrot, our view from the inside makes it difficult to accurately determine much about it.) 

Depends on the definition of labour. There, indeed, are people who like some kind of non-intellectual labour. There are people who don't like it. Intellectual labour is - arts, science and philosophy. Yes, mere translation of algorithm from human language to programming language is not really intellectual. But development of new algorithms is intellectual labour. Of course, the word emancipate means those who don't want X, won't need to do it in order to fulfill their desires. So, why have I started to talk about intellectual labour? As you may think, among those people who do intellectual labour, much higher percentage do it because they want to do it, as opposed to those who do physical labour. Latter majorly do it only to have money, which on their turn, allows people to fulfill their desires. If they were not be in need for money, they would not do it. While artists, scientists and philosophers still would exist and do arts, science and philosophy. This means that non-intellectual labour is majorly seen as undesirable and should be automated. People strived for this, and do it now. Of course, large corporations, as I see it, do it partially because it allows to get money faster. But that does not negate the fact that people want to get more by spending less. So, there are a few prognoses possible. Prognosis 1. Automation reaches the threshold when further automation is unprofitable for large companies, from the position of currency. So, automation stops. And no emancipation from labour. Prognosis 2. This prognosis is really pessimistic one. As we know, money have only instrumental value. When there are only a little money, their value is survival and purchase of some desirable goods and services. But when there are a lot of money, their value turns to hard power. Power itself already can be seen by some people as having intrisic value. And then those people would prefer to have robots and other devices, while depriving others. Just because it allows having more power, which is seen as having intrisic value. But as I said, it is pessimistic one, if really many people see power as intrisically valuable and not merely instrumentally. Prognosis 3. As I said in prognosis 1, there is a threshold when further automation is unprofitable. In the optimistic case people will change current social structure by better one. By current I mean the one that offers only money as stimulus for labour (and automation itself is labour). By better I mean one that is better suited for it's purpose - emancipation from labour. In either case, it won't be capitalistic anymore. 

Assumes the cost of feigning belief is negligible Assumes penalties for non-worship are worse than those for worshiping the "wrong" deity Assumes "god" doesn't (or can't) differentiate between those with true belief versus those who are just hedging their bets Assumes "god" does not reward intellectual honesty 

Without a set of rules existing beyond mankind to hold to (e.g. religion), it is difficult to imagine an objective answer to this question. If the purpose of life isn't assumed to come from some "greater being", then it is inherently a personal matter. That being said, Secular Humanism is probably your best bet for an objective look at these questions. Essentially, it is the logical continuation of the inherent biological motivations which have gotten mankind to this point. In that context, the purpose would be to perpetuate the species. Progress the body of human knowledge which has done such an efficient job at making us the top organism on the planet. Ensure the continued habitability of the environment and/or solve the problems keeping mankind from inhabiting other planets. Are those objectively correct? I'd say no, but I think it's about as close as you'll get without the referencing a deity of some variety. 

Freedom is a language construct. It is used for conviction. E.g. when some social groups say their freedom is violated, it means they are dissatisfied with current status and want something to be changed. Of course, in order to be more persuasive, they ought to use thick moral concepts. One of such concepts is freedom. Therefore, what really freedom is varies on context pretty well. Sometimes it can mean your first definition, sometimes second. Sometimes it can even mean omnipotence and omniscience. Now answering on your other questions, one by one. 

This depends on the definition of sanity. There surely are people who would incessantly use drugs or will just be so bored that they'd commit a suicide. But majority of people wants automation not for these purposes. I don't see any problems why should automation be banned. 

So, when we say to a child not to touch hot object, even if their will is to touch it, we refer to future will: the child will be hurt by it and the result of that will be undesirable, which means that future will of the child will be not to touch hot object. So, we take into account the future will when say someone not to do something sometimes. But is there any estabilished term denoting both present and future will? I am asking that because I am wondering if the ethics/morals taking into the account both present and future will can be named "will consequentialism". Or another wording for will generalized to the whole time continuum could be named "sense" but I am unsure about it as well. 

Knowledge is a label for the electrical/chemical status of particular elements of the brain. That brain state is the physical manifestation, but -since we don't typically observe any of that directly- humans generally identify with the experience of 'knowing' something instead of the physics of it. Compare to 'happiness,' which is a similar label for what happens to the body under the influence of particular hormones. Or anger. Or a decision. The physical manifestation of these things are arcane, and do not lend themselves to easy understanding in context of day-to-day life. People had created these labels (and spent thousands of years philosphizing and debating over them) before we had any notion of the neuro-chemistry from which they spring. 

In a word, No. Pascal's wager makes a number of assumptions which our hypothetical Strong Agnostic should question: 

It seems some great answers have been given, but just to add something else: Regardless of whether a scientific theory is later proven to be incorrect, the data and testing that previously supported that theory are still just as correct and useful. It is just our interpretation of that data which is brought into question. I feel this is important to mention, because I have often heard people mention that science's practice of regularly tossing out previously held beliefs means that it is inconsistent and untrustworthy. If tomorrow, the theory of gravity was proven to not be accurate in describing some newly discovered phenomenon, that does not make it any less accurate at describing the things it used to. It is no longer an all encompassing framework that can be used, but that doesn't change the fact that 99.9% of what it states remains true. 

The analogy from real life: Let's say you have simulated a world in the computer. If you are tracking what happens there it already is changing you. Because that generates new memories in you thus changing your mind. If you're just watching, it is interaction in our world, but as I said may be not the case outside of it. Conscious changes indeed require some kind of tracking thus if you are consciously changing that world, you (as mind) are changing. And many faiths (probably all) declare that god[s] is/are conscious. 

The statement would be false if he said "The outcome can only be 1 or 2." Would it be lying even in this case? Well, being wrong does not mean lie. Lying implies that the liar himself does not believe in his own words. The person who is wrong because of unawareness or unintended errors (fallacies, acceptance of wrong premises, etc.) is not lying. According to Cambridge Dictionary 'lie' is: 

It is possible to know a very limited set of things with absolute certainty, i.e. not dependent on basic fundamental assumptions that "could" end up being wrong. For instance, things I am absolutely certain about: 

It sounds like you're referring to the "Law of Cause and Effect," which tells us that every material effect has a prior cause. I counter that your question is an example of special pleading, suggesting that everything requires a cause, except for this super special uncaused cause which started everything. Either every "cause requires a cause" or "not every cause requires a cause." Either all causes were caused by a prior event, meaning the uni-multi-ultraverse model you propose is perpetual, or not every cause requires a prior cause which means there is no need for a special snowflake "initial cause" needing to "choose" to start things off. Anyway, modern science (and the Law of Cause and Effect) only offer models for how reality operates in our present universe. As such, it does not (necessarily) apply before our universe existed, and may not have even applied during the initial moments after the big bang. Our scientific models of the universe do not speak to how things worked before the big bang, and currently the only thing we know about things before planck time are that things certainly did NOT operate according to the same rules ($URL$ 

Recently I saw Heinz's dilemma and actually I found that none of the actions or purposes is really wrong or right to me. But I found that punishing (e.g. imprisoning) Heinz (in the case he steals the drug) would be wrong to me. Although my ethics do not answer whether he is wrong, various theories do (some can say it will lead to good consequences, therefore he does right action, and some can say it is violation of duty). But I hardly can understand what these theories suggest to do with those whith peoplr who were "right" or "wrong". Therefore I'm wondering now if the question of punishment (and reward) lies within ethics. If so, what is the ethics branch studying it? 

Why yes? Ask any human whether they consider group sex, promiscuity or other unconventional sexual practices good. With higher than 50% probability answer will be "no". Of course this is the result of Christian faith at least in Western world (as Conifold pointed out). But I'd say it had global influences due to colonization by West (pre-20th century) and globalization. Of course you will point out that I'm saying about unconventional sexual practices. But that's what the question is: it asks not about sex in marriage, but about sex in itself. Since of that and the feeling that minors can be involved in such sexual practices it is considered good to censure sex in society. Obviously, we can't ignore the fact that laws censoring sex may try to reduce teen births as well. But in my experience they are not really effective as the vast majority of 13 year olds (my country laws suggest 16 year old age for sexual consent and right as everywhere 18 year old age for watching porn) know what sex is and even have masturbated. Not surprising at all, is it? 

Species existing today have a biological preference for survival, because species without this trait don't tend to survive long. This is the same reason that beneficial traits tend to spread throughout the species population while harmful traits tend to disappear. Non-preference for self (or offsprings') survival is a trait that isn't going to have much success being passed on. Early organisms likely did not have any such preference, of course, but there weren't many predatory organisms around either. Once eating each other became a bit more popular, any organisms that happened to develop the trait for self-preservation would drastically out perform those that didn't mind being eaten. So survival isn't objectively necessary, however it is a trait you're going to see in most/any species that last more than a few generations. 

As you've likely come across yourself, secular humanism is the most prominent atheist replacement for religious moral guidelines:
