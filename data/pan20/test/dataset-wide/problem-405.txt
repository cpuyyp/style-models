To answer the question directly; I don't think it is possible "intelligence" was "brought" by anything; as an earlier answer details, the evidence is overwhelming that intelligence arose slowly over hundreds of millions of years. Our neurons are not functionally different than the million found in a fly or cockroach; we just have a hundred thousand times as many, far more complexly organized, and even then not very much differently than neurons in great apes. Mice and Corvids are "intelligent" and creative problem solvers. A working definition of intelligence will help us: Not all scientists agree, but a pretty good working definition for AI researchers (including me) is that intelligence is the ability to form models based on observations that let us predict most likely states in the future or past. The more accurate and far reaching these predictions are, the greater the intelligence. Animals with less intelligence can be trapped by animals with greater intelligence; the fish doesn't realize what the hook shape will do in its mouth until it is too late; the human fashioning the hook shape does so with a model of how fish bite and behave, and a model of how the hook (like an arrow) can enter flesh easily in one direction but be difficult to pull out in the other. In the "past" direction; we have forensics, or something like astronomy or geology: Intelligence, in the form of working models, lets us narrow down what must have happened, to either a singular event (e.g. a neutron star exploded) or at least a small set of possible explanations (e.g. Adam either killed himself or his wife murdered him and made it look like suicide). Either way; consider it an ability to model interactions, predict the outcome of various interventions, etc. Then super-intelligent aliens may have supervised evolution and intentionally caused mutations they could predict would be key to developing future intelligence. That isn't "bringing" intelligence, more like "creating" it, or the conditions for it to arise. The difference between causing seeds to be scattered on fertile ground, versus planting already sprouted seedlings. To our knowledge there is some chaos theory that suggests very far reaching intelligence is not possible; there are too many confounding factors. So likely, if guided evolution is how we came to be sufficiently intelligent to create a civilization (however one might define that, but you know what I mean), then it could be "without a trace", because we have no idea where mutations come from. We think they are chance; but for a super-intelligent race, they may have chosen to mutate genes in ways that were specifically plausible but hadn't happened yet. Or they may have, opportunistically again, arranged certain "accidental deaths" to prune the tree into a shape they wanted. I'd call that topiary: Some bushes sprout in many directions; but if you want the bush to look like a duck, you can choose to clip branching sprouts that won't fit into the overall pattern you see in your mind's eye. Darwin's unnatural selection model for livestock did exactly this: The mutations in the livestock were natural, but the human livestock managers terminated undesirable mutations, or at least did not let them mate, while desirable random mutations were mated extensively. Aliens supervising human evolution could have done something similar; with greater foresight into the ramifications of each mutation, both physically and socially. 

A plausible reason would be a Near Death Experience, for the country itself, such that secret negotiations and the corruption that naturally goes with it destroyed them economically and caused a major coup attempt that nearly turned them into a dictatorship. In the shooting war that followed to prevent this political disaster on top of an already devastating financial disaster that left them in a great depression, the government was reformed, as for the people. Part of that reformation was absolute public meetings, there are laws in place so if any politician meets with any other in private, both are guilty of a serious crime (mandatory sentencing of 3 years in prison, forfeiture of 100% of assets, and barred from politics for life). The people created a policing organization, the Congressional Collusion Investigation and Prosecuting Force (CCIPF), and they have draconian power to enforce it: Politicians cannot be friends with each other and make deals on the golf course, they will go to jail. The standard of proof is simply "preponderance of evidence"; the lowest bar (in the USA) for a conviction. Why would anybody become a politician? It pays very well, as much as, say, a surgeon. Plus half that amount for life after holding office; because they will also be prohibited for life from taking any other paid job or form of income, once elected. While holding office they get CCIPF bodyguards, they travel, they decide matters of national importance. They can have family and friends, they just have to be careful. But one of their official roles is campaigning, arguing for or against laws in the media, etc. Their CCIPF bodyguards are assigned and cycled at random; and also carry 24/7 recording equipment, the recordings are open to the public, and can be used in either prosecution or defense of any charges of collusion (e.g. accidentally shaking hands with another politician at a wedding is not collusion.) And CCIPF officers can wear GPS trackers when on the job, so they can all have electronic proximity alerts if any other CCIPF officers, assigned to any other politician, are anywhere near their charge. Communications could let them negotiate sufficient buffer space (or alertness) to keep them separated. The CCIPF will give them fair warning if anybody new in their life has political ties, or anybody already in their life develops new political ties. An honorable politician can make an upper class living for life, the job is relatively easy, and there will be no shortage of candidates. The CCIPF is similarly constrained: Investigations of politicians are publicly assigned to the CCIPF officers by lottery; and their own lives must be an open book, too. They can never, ever be politicians or involved in politics themselves; joining the CCIPF, even for six months, bars them for life from holding any elected or governmental office or even participating in a campaign or advocating for a particular politician, bill, or scheme. They cannot express an opinion between pro-choice or pro-life; they have no political free speech. They are allowed to vote, in secret, but revealing their vote is a crime. Every dime they earn or spend is recorded and public knowledge. Further, the CCIPF is funded independently by their own tax which politicians cannot touch, short of a complete rewrite of their Constitution. Further, the CCIPF itself is incapable of making any law or rule for the citizenry. It has its own court system with CCIPF judges, also assigned by lottery; and trials and evidence for collusion between politicians are public and the jury deliberations are open and recorded. Who enforces the laws against the CCIPF? The CCIPF; they are organized into a dozen independent bases in the country (like military bases). New recruits are assigned at random to one of these. Charges against CCIPF members are given a trial by CCIPF judges chosen at random from another base with a jury of their peers; one from each base. Other rules like that; like the USA military, the CCIPF is its own sub-culture, a semi-democracy with its own courts and rules about how to conduct itself. Make the country's wounds fresh, this all happened, say, 150 years ago, and people still honor the names of their relatives that fought and died to create the CCIPF. There are multiple national holidays celebrating various milestones in that "War On Corruption", statues to the heroes and first generals of the CCIPF, the first fallen in the name of Honest Government, and so on. That is the "social element", the CCIPF is seen like soldiers: Heroic, self-sacrificing, and utterly honorable; they are trusted because the structure leaves little reason to doubt them. Our soldiers protect us from foreign threats, the CCIPF protects us from being taken over by our own mentally ill citizens that have no conscience and seek only self-enrichment and megalomaniacal power, fame, and being feared. Even if politicians truly believe the open negotiation law is stupid and crippling, they do not violate it, they learn to work within these constraints because they have a good life if they stay within them, and there is too much to lose and not enough to gain by violating them. The uncontrollably greedy or megalomaniacs best not apply, they can exercise those traits in the corporate world. Politicians will be people happy with the generous salary, retirement, and other perks of being in the top management tier of the country. 

A) Consider the human tongue; a long boneless appendage, muscular, that (in some people) can manipulate finely enough to tie a knot in string (perhaps holding one end in the teeth, I don't know). B) Consider the nose of the elephant; the tip is bifurcated and can be manipulated by the elephant like fingers: It can pick up a dime off of a smooth floor. It can use the same trunk to pick up a log weighing several hundred pounds. It can pick up a child and put it unharmed on its own head. It can pick an apple off a tree. C) Consider the octopus; it can open a screw top jar using two tentacles, and reach inside to capture a shrimp with a third. I don't think there is any issue of fine control. I do think, of course, our tools and technology are themselves 'evolved' to fit what our hands and joints can do. Our buttons and handles are a size made for fingers to push, or hands to wrap around. How a tentacle might be used will be different: if your buttons were on a device that fit in your mouth and were meant to be pushed with your tongue, the device would obviously look much different than a keyboard; require different tactical feedback, and perhaps be more sensitive to a push. If I need to hold a tool, we all know how to make our tongue large by contracting muscles so we couldn't even close our mouth: A tentacle might have fine control of the tip to allow the same; so the 'handle' of such a tool is an empty cavity, into which the tentacle is inserted and then muscularly 'inflated' to 'grip' the tool from the inside. certainly those muscles can be as strong or stronger than human hand grip, of a hammer, screwdriver, etc. Speaking of tools, I'd expect little variation on what we have. A screw or bolt is an inclined plane in helical form; it is a useful shape that has nothing to do with human form. Many tools are the same; a hammer isn't about humans, it is just a refined version of a hard rock; a saw or an axe or a blade or a drill has nothing to do with human form, neither does rope or string, gears or pulleys. An elephant can pull a rope over a compound pulley with its trunk, even better than a human can with its hands and arms. It isn't the working end of the tools I'd expect to change, just the 'user interface' if the engineers have tentacles instead of hands. 

I think, to reach the stone age, your animals need to be less capable, so that intelligence, planning, and strategy become more of a factor in their survival. Compared to other animals, humans are muscularly weak, terrible runners, have pitiful claws and canines, weak bite strength, are extremely un-stealthy, we have a pitiful olfactory sense, we don't even have good night-vision or day-vision compared to many birds and other animals. How, for your caninoids, is a cutting stone edge better than their own claws and teeth? It is an obvious advantage for our human ancestors; not obvious at all for a canine that can outrun, outfight, and bite-cut the throats of prey up to and including the size of earthly elk and buffalo. You need some reason for their brains and foresight to be necessary to their survival and growth; and by building them like battle tanks, you remove all those reasons. Think of intelligence as being a progression toward better mental simulation of the future; an ability to imagine how things will turn out. We humans can imagine the future in such detail that we can build lakes, dams, skyscrapers and roads that cross significant stretches of the planet. But it is intelligence that simulates turning a round stone into a sharp blade; or lets us affix such a blade to a stick as a spear point, that imagines plunging that spear into a rhino while avoiding being killed by it. Metaphorically speaking, this is how the mouse kills the lion: better prediction of how the lion will act, materials will behave, and physics will play out to trap and kill the beast. Intelligence is the ultimate weapon that beats the most fearsome non-mental biological advantages, by letting the intelligent avoid and thwart them. To get to the stone age, your species needs a reason that their physical attributes are not enough to win and they will go extinct if they don't gain intelligence. You need an evolutionary pressure that threatens their existence, over a long enough term for intelligence to grow. For humans with almost zero battle ability as our naked selves, that was an easy call; almost everything could kill us, and the slightest intelligence advantage led to a better chance of our survival, and because we are so weak and imperfect every slight increase led to more survival. There is no such evolutionary pressure on top physicality predators; the shark survives and reproduces just fine by brute force alone, higher intelligence would cost the shark more calories than it would ever gain them. (Only intelligent humans threaten the survival of sharks.) At best, the intelligence is fairly short term strategic trapping in big cats and canine species. Notice that animals as intelligent as dolphins do not have a lot of physical battle instruments: no claws, poor teeth, bad eyesight, no armoring. Intelligence is critical to their survival. As appealing as you may find a tough caninoid that can hold its own without tools against a tiger, you have to give them a serious existential problem that claws, night-vision, muscles, biting strength, speed, etc simply cannot solve. They need to get smarter, over tens of thousands of years, for a good survival reason. Otherwise there is no reason for them to get smart enough to be able to imagine days ahead in the future, spending weeks and months without any immediate reward to learn to manufacture a tool for some imagined future use, even a simple stone tool.
