Here the commentary veers to talk of the 6 realms before returning to the Bard experience and Bardo visions. 

The vows are very specific in stating that to disparage another tradition, or to cause rifts in the dharma is a downfall. 

Dharmakāya is tricky business to explain. If you were to explain it to someone who has never heard of the concept where would you begin? How does it fit in with attraction and aversion? At the same time the explainer would have to make sure to cover the different ways the word Dharmanakaya has been used. 

The last step is called "Applying the Antidote" Using the chart, or in some cases logical reasoning, you determine the antidote to the karma you are working with. Stealing would have an antidote of generosity for example. In this step you will have to think about your individual conditions. If you think of karma like seeds, the idea is this, you stop watering the "bad" karmic seeds. You plant "good" seeds that are related to the "bad" seeds you wish to uproot. In the case of killing, the antidote of protecting life should be applied. Getting and taking care of pets. Donating to disaster relief charities. Get creative, anything that prevents sickness and harm. Apply plenty of antidote, and try to keep the application up until the period you decided on in step 3 has passed. Go through these steps multiple times if necessary. One important thing to note: Karma does not simply disappear, this purification process just speeds up the queue. 

While working with these energies you will experience a period where the karma you are working with ripens quickly, the purification process is not easy, and you will experience suffering directly related to the karma you are working with. To wrap this up a quick quote from the Diamond Cutter Sutra and one from Tai Situ Rinpoche. 

To the best of my knowledge Essentialism is not a part of any school of Buddhism. Essentialism deals with metaphysical essentialism, and is essentially on the opposite end of the spectrum from emptiness/sunyata, which might be refereed to by some as Metaphysical anti-realism. However I have not met many Buddhists that want to jump into that classification. Taoists love it though. The Buddhists will assert that there is an Ultimate truth, and so can never truely be metaphysical anti-realists. At least not in the most extreme case of the view. They do show some grey areas from time to time. 

Take a look at the 8 auspicious symbols, The Auspicious Drawing, sometimes refereed to as the infinite knot represents the intertwining of wisdom and compassion. 

In most Buddhists cosmologies worlds and civilizations come and go... Whole worlds go extinct. Hell Realms come and go... as do biological species... buildings... yada yada... Heaven Realms... human and animal lives, the whole nine yards. This process is larger than a lifetime though in scale, worlds of beings raise and fall out of existence, our lifetimes do not extend the duration required for observing these events. All that being said, sex in itself is not an inherently bad thing. You are correct that if sex was never engaged in humanity would go extinct. Since all current medical technology can't end age... As pointed out in the other answer it is certain behaviors that are to be avoided for lay people concerned about karma. The majority of these things involve things like consent, respect. 

These situations require what is sometimes refereed to as skillful means In your first example there are some possible replies, like in one Buddhist story a witness is called to the stand, and when asked a series of questions, he replied "I saw" "I did not see" to each of the questions. In such a way that no new information was added to the trial. However what if the man with weapons turns on you, then you have a different problem. So then what answer is neither lie nor an answer that might anger the man with the weapon towards you? "I had dinner a few hours ago" "I like your pants, where did you get them?" "It sure is cloudy today" These statements (assuming they are true at the time) avoid the truth that the weapon wielder seeks. Aside from the Bodhisattva vows there is nothing saying you have to answer a question when asked, and even there, there are provisions for being asked questions that might cause harm. In the second situation you could say things like "I don't feel comfortable having this conversation" "You should ask them that not me" or as ChrisW pointed out "I think it is better not to gossip" 

You can be a "practice monk" Take on the practice of, and learn the precepts of a monk, described in the other answers on this page. Doing so without formally taking the vows is still "good karma" and doing so will allow you to get an idea of what the actual monks life is like. Taking vows is said to be "stronger" karma, if you keep them. Figure out which vows or practices you absolutely cannot incorporate into your lay life, set aside "Monk days" to do the full commitment, and lay days, where you do not do these set aside commitments. Being a "practice monk" is kind of like the light beer of spiritual practice, horrible metaphor I know, but here is what I mean : You get some of the benefit without any of the risk. You won't have the potential to break any vows. Which is considered "strong bad karma." You also get a preview of the life, and can make the decision from a more informed view point if you ever decide to take on the vows. Also, if you do take on the vows later, the transition will be easier, as you have practiced. 

A vision of the Realm of the gods occurs here in tandem, blue light is terrifying, white light is comforting, a long tangent about the realm of the gods is here,running in fear to the white light the second day begins. The second day 

There are already plenty of answers on this question, but I felt the need to add my two cents, as my view on this is slightly different. In Tibetan Buddhism there is an emphasis on purifying ones karma. In a common mantra is contained within it a load of symbolism and varied traditions. The order in which to purify ones behaviors was in these 3 syllables. OM - Body AH - Speech HUM - Mind Within these 3 "bodies" as they referred to them, one must purify the actions of... The body is considered the easiest of the 3 to control. The speech the second easiest. The mind of course, is the most difficult to master. The kind of karma that video games would create, if any, would fall under HUM. Except some fringe conditions of course, like if you swear at relatives when you miss a re-spawn point. That would fall under AH. If you punch your dog because you got head shot in match of Call of Duty, then that would fall under an action of OM. If those prior two examples resonate with you, you might want to take a step back to the basics. If however they do not (I will just take your word for it) you might be concerned with the subtle aspects of mind. In which I would argue that video games can be used as a tool, just like any other tool. Roleplaying games allow you to see your mind act as if it would if you were in situations you cannot be in within real life. If you observe your mind while you play, in a way it could become a kind of meditation. If for example there was a hypothetical video game called "Bodhisattva" or "Monk" where one played those roles. Bodhisattva would essentially be the opposite of Call of Duty, think magical monks running around blocking bullets. (Keep in mind this is a hypothetical) Would these games have benefit ? Depends on who develops them. But all this brings me to the point I want to make. A game like Bodhisattva is just simulation. You aren't saving lives, you are pretending to do so. Same with Call of Duty. Doing and pretending are not equal. In fact if playing GTA is the worst thing you have done in your life, your karma is quite nice in comparison. So let's be reasonable, yes there is an influence that like any other art form, book, music, painting, etc will have. However Buddhism is about neither acceptance nor rejection. The dharmakaya as described by Chogyam Trungpa is what I refer to here. The video game is empty of any inherent being. Our interaction with it is what we must watch. The video games influence on you might be null, it might be vast. You must be aware of what influence it has on you. The karma that you reap from those moments could be good or bad. Your reaction to it is what matters. In conclusion I will more directly answer the 3 questions you asked: 

Also Buddhism is not nihilistic, never do they throw up their hands and say, nothing matters do whatever you want. The only term with nihilism in it that might come close to paralleling with the Buddhist worldview that I can think of is Mereological nihilism. 

No, nirvana is not omnipotence and complete control of the universe. Nirvana is understanding and embracing the true nature of ones mind. Any state of getting whatever you want is impermanent. The ultimate goal is ending suffering, I think this matters, I'd like to reduce suffering, it seems a fair task. Some schools teach only the reduction of your own suffering. Others the reduction of all suffering held by any sentient being. 

To add to the already good spread of answers here, carelessness is something to be avoided. Stepping on an ant can still add up, especially if throughout the week it becomes ants. If you can avoid it, but do not avoid it, you are in some sense complacent. Now if there is the situation where one was completely unaware of the situation and did not see the bug until it was too late... Well that is different. But if the sidewalk is flowing with ants, and one knows this, one should watch their step as they traverse the path... And maybe put ones phone away for the few minutes of travel, and try to just be, and observe things as they are. 

Feeding local animals is also a form of generosity, it could be for that reason as well. You could wait near the tree in silent meditation until the food scattering person arrives and ask them personally for the best answer. 

If one wanted to do a 3 day to a one week unguided retreat what would they need to know? I am planning on doing this, with meals purchased and prepared by me in advance. The plan was 6 - 8 hours of sleep, meditation on awakening, yoga and a light breakfast, meditation, study of texts, meditation, light lunch, meditation, basic upkeep of the area, meditation, light dinner, meditation and repeat. Are there other aspects to the retreat that should be added? 

$URL$ The website link above has breakdowns of works by Je Tsongkhapa, -- (Specifically his work on Lam Rim) -- Nāgārjuna, Shantideva, and various lojung texts with their respective analysis. The audio classes are MP3 streams, and the teachers tend to do a sentence by sentence breakdown of the works being discussed. They come with PDFs of student notes, lectures and outlines, and readings in both English and the original Tibetan. Some sutras are also available in both languages, and the website is entirely free of any charges. 

From the Tibetan Buddhism perspective this is a possible outcome. In philosophy David Lewis calls these possible worlds. It might even be true in the actual world. Which is the world we live in. The bardo and rebirth would have to happen first of course. Also human rebirth is considered to be rare, rarer still is human rebirth that is interested in the dharma. But it seems if the worldview is correct, that human rebirths would become more common. But all that aside, the human realm is still Saṃsāra. Being reborn is rough, relearning everything takes time. Where they were born and to what families will determine what they learn and in what order. I think that covers the first question. As for the assumption after the first question, kindness and generosity is said to result in wealth, and being in safety respectively. I do not understand what you mean in your last sentence though. You mention one of the 3 vehicles. 

Great question ! I once attended a lecture where a story was told about a private Buddha. This particular one lived an entire life as a human, all the ups and downs of a normal average life for the time. All for one encounter with another human on a bus, where in that encounter the private Buddha screamed angrily in the other persons face, and then got off the bus to live the rest of the life born into. It was said that encounter led to a series of unfolding events that set the other human on the path towards liberation. In contrast, if the private buddha had given a sermon on the bus it might not have had the same effects. 

It really just depends. There are so many factors, the game, your thoughts while playing it, and the influence it has on you. If you are playing Professor Layton games, I'd say the answer is most certainly a no. Call of Duty is more likely a yes. But it is still not necessarily so... Bottom line / TL;DR : Analyze your life before your video games. Changes there are more likely to have karmic impact. But do not deceive your self, if video games are part of your life, you must include them in the analysis. 

Note : Answer is still in progress, the commentary is finished and a basic outline is present, I will be adding details and clarifying things as I continue to read the book. I also have an audio lecture I will be re-listening to, and using it to add details to each stage. There are still some stages I know of that have not been mentioned in the commentary. (The karmic mirror stage, the taking the body of your next life stage) I will insert them appropriately when found 

Intoxicants in Buddhism are frowned on by every Buddhist school of thought. However you didn't ask that, so we won't dive into those details. After some time looking i could not find any evidence that Arada, or the Sankhya practices used any kind of drugs. It was mostly types of meditation, the last three stages can be found in this article which attempts to spell out the entire process of the practice from beginning to end in a way anyone can access and understand. 

We can say the ship is what disappears during Meditation on I-am-ness The water during the Meditation with Buddhi standing alone The last part of the metaphor is slightly misleading to match up with the last stage, it is not you're gone, but the ego that disappears, sometimes refereed to as Ego Death by mystics and psychedelic users. The last stage of Sankhya Purusha resting in itself could be compared to Ego death, and is a kind of pure conciousness that does not contain an I or an Ego, or any kind of self identity. This is the goal of the practitioner. This is also the hardest thing to ever put into words. So in conclusion and summary : did the school and practitioners use psychedelics, likely no, they did not. These states can be reached in meditation. Are these states similar to some reported psychedelic experiences, yes. However the key difference is that psychedelics are somewhat unpredictable. You could take the same substance and have two incredibly different experiences, and even experiences completely the opposite of Ego Death. Whereas the practices of the Sankhya are designed to always lead to the same place, with time and effort into the practices. Further I think it is worth mentioning that Buddha moved on from this school, was not satisfied with the result as a goal. He even stated it lay on one extreme of the spectrum which the middle way lay between it and the other end of the spectrum.
