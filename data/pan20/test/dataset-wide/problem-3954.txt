So, we now need to count the number of fixed points for the dihedral and the $PGL_2$ action. The dihedral action Since $r+1$ is odd, every reflection fixes a point, explaining the $1$ for $m$ odd. Nontrivial rotations do not have fixed points, explaining the $1/(r+1)$. The $PGL_2$ action We use the isomorphism $PGL_2 = PSL_2 = SL_2$. There are $r+1$ conjugacy classes in $SL_2$, namely 

If $X \subset \mathbb{P}^N$ is a projective variety and $Z$ is a nonempty effective algebraic cycle, then the cohomology class of $Z$ is always nonzero. Proof: Let $\dim X = n$ and let $\dim Z = k$. Then, by Bertini, a generic $\mathbb{P}^{N-k}$ in $\mathbb{P}^N$ meets $Z$ in a finite number of points. Let $H$ be such a $\mathbb{P}^{N-k}$ and let $W = X \cap H$. Then the classes of $W$ and $Z$ have nontrivial cup product in $H^{\ast}(X)$. The key point here is that, when two algebraic varieties of complementary dimensions meet in a set of dimension zero, that intersection always has positive multiplicity. So nothing like the construction you suggest in your final paragraph can give trivial classes -- you need to either work on a non-projective variety or allow negative terms in your cycles. 

I'm planning lectures for my intro algebraic geometry course, and I noted something awkward that is coming up. We're starting projective varieties soon. Of course, we'll prove that projective maps are closed. Then, I want to talk about Grassmannians. I want to show that the Grassmannian is closed in the Plucker embedding. In other words, I want to know that the set of rank $1$ tensors is closed in $\mathbb{P} \left( \bigwedge\nolimits^k \mathbb{C}^n \right)$. This sounds like it should be a great application of the theorem that projective maps are closed, right? Send $\mathbb{P}^{n-1} \times \mathbb{P}^{n-1} \times \cdots \times \mathbb{P}^{n-1}$ to $\mathbb{P} \left( \bigwedge\nolimits^k \mathbb{C}^n \right)$ by $(v_1, v_2,\ldots, v_k) \mapsto v_1 \wedge v_2 \wedge \cdots \wedge v_k$? Except that this is only a rationally defined map -- it isn't defined when the $v_i$ are linearly dependent. Of course, I can prove that the rank $1$ tensors are closed by brute force. I also know some conceptual explanations that are not appropriate as the primary proof for this class (though I may well comment on some of them): 

At the very least, it implies the following: Let $f: A \to B$ be a map of sets where every fiber has cardinality $2$. Then there is a section of $f$. Proof: Let $V$ be the $\mathbb{R}$-vector space spanned by the elements of $A$, subject to the relation $a_1 = - a_2$ whenever $f(a_1)=f(a_2)$. Let $S$ be $\mathrm{Sym}(V)$ and $K$ be $\mathrm{Frac}(S)$. Then $K$ is formally real (any proposed sum of squares only uses finitely many elements of $A$, so we can reduce to the case of a finite dimensional vector space, where this is obvious). But to choose an ordering, we need to decide which element of each fiber of $f$ will be positive and which will be negative. The positive elements form a section. 

I learned this picture from Billera, Holmes and Vogtman; see Figure 18. Their focus in on describing the space of all trees, not just the planar ones, so they have many associahedra glued together instead of just one, but they certainly talk about the individual associahedra. 

Scott Aaronson maintains a list of references on Quantum Computing. (In the right hand side bar, you'll have to scroll down a bit.) His Scientific American article may be the lowest level introduction which doesn't actually lie to you. 

This question is pretty technical, but there are some very smart people here. Fix a quiver Q, WITH oriented cycles. Let k[[Q]] be the completed path algebra. (Like the path algebra, but we allow formal infinite sums.) My question is about what behavior I should expect when I equip Q with a generic choice of potential. A potential, denoted S, is a formal sum of (nontrivial) closed cycles in k[[Q]]. I'm interested in the case where the coefficients of that sum are chosen generically. Let J(S) denote the Jacobian ideal of S. This is a two sided ideal which is, roughly speaking, generated by the derivatives of S. (See Derksen-Weyman-Zelevinsky for the precise definitions.) [DWZ] show that the space of deformations of (Q,S) is k[[Q]]/(J(S) + [,]) where [,] is the vector space (NOT usually an ideal) spanned by commutators. They define (Q,S) to be rigid if this vector space is spanned by the empty cycle. Heuristic arguments seem to suggest that a generic potential is always rigid. But example 8.6 in [DWZ] shows that this is false. Can someone give me a better heuristic or, better yet, a theorem? EDITED to fix errors involving cycles of length 0. 

Just for the fun of it, I used the above construction to find a polynomial $\sum_{i=1}^{20} \theta_i (u-\tau)^i$ with $|\theta_i| < 1/2$ and all coefficients other than the constant term integral. The constant term turned out to be $-3878005 + 1739105 \sqrt{5} \approx 10752.00000977$. If I round that off to $10752$, the resulting polynomial factors as $(2 - u)^9 (1 - u)^5 (3 - 3 u + u^2) (7 - 15 u + 14 u^2 - 6 u^3 + u^4)$. Making the variable substitution suggests that our next family of polynomials should be the coefficients of $$\frac{1}{1-z} \left( \frac{z^5 (1 - 2 z)^9 (1 - 3 z + 3 z^2) (1 - 5 z + 11 z^2 - 13 z^3 + 7 z^4)}{(1 - z)^{20}} \right)^m.$$ Of the four roots of $7 - 15 u + 14 u^2 - 6 u^3 + u^4$, two are at distance $0.883514$ from $\tau$ and two are at distance $1.02472$. Much past $N=20$, my naive implementation times out. 

The key papers on this seem to be by Krichever: I skimmed "Commutative rings of ordinary linear differential operators" and "Integration of nonlinear equations by the methods of algebraic geometry". I am not certain that I understood them correctly; I hope an expert will show up to correct any errors. Let $f$ be any nonscalar element of $A_1$ and let $C(f)$ be the set of $g\in A_1$ that commute with $f$. Then $C(f)$ is a finitely generated $k[f]$-module. In particular, if $R$ is a commutative ring containing $f$, then $R$ is a finitely generated $k[f]$ module. This result is originally due to Flanders; see Amitsur for an elementary proof. Let $R$ be a commutative subalgebra of $A_1$. We have just showed that $R$ is a $\mathbb{C}$-algebra which is finite over $\mathbb{C}[f]$ for any nonscalar $f$ in $R$. Let $\tilde{R}$ be the normalization of $R$. Then this shows that $\mathrm{Spec}(\tilde{R})$ is a curve with one puncture. (If there were more than one puncture, we could find $f$ in $R$ which blew up at one of the punctures and not another, and then $R$ wouldn't be finite over $\mathbb{C}[f]$.) It seems like papers in this field describe the size of subalgebras of $A_1$ using two parameters: The genus of $\mathrm{Spec}(\tilde{R})$ and something called the "rank". I didn't understand the more sophisticated description of rank, but it seems to have the following elementary description: Let $\phi \in R \subset A_1$ be a nonscalar. Considered as an element of $\tilde{R}$, let $\phi$ have a pole of order $d$ at the puncture. Considered as an element of $A_1$, let $\phi$ be a polynomial in $p$ and $q$ of degree $e$. Then $e/d$ is an integer independent of $\phi$, called the rank. WARNING: I inferred this from context; no one explicitly said it. See Mokhov for constructions of commutative subalgebras of arbitrary genus and rank. You asked about number of generators. In other words, you would like the ring $R$ to have many generators. This is not what most papers focus on and I agree with Qiaochu that it isn't the best notion of size, but I'll try to think about it. If $R = \tilde{R}$, then $R$ can be generated by $3$ elements because any smooth affine curve embeds into $\mathbb{C}^3$. (Take a generic projection of a high dimensional embedding.) I found papers that stated that $R$ need not equal to $\tilde{R}$, but I didn't find explicit examples. The papers of Krichever linked above are supposed to be answering the inverse problem: Given $R$, build the ring of differential operators, but I couldn't extract an explicit statement from them of whether this is always possible. 

The Frobenius and Cebatarov density theorems -- the factorization of an integer polynomial modulo various primes is controlled by the Galois group of the corresponding extensions. Even if you are really hard core about excluding analytic results, to the point that you won't accept statements about Dirichlet density, surely it is worth understanding why $x^3+2 x^2-x-1$ always factors into (linear)(linear)(linear) or stays irreducible, but is never (linear)(quadratic). 

Here is another sanity check. Consider the map $f$ from $X$ to a point. The (topological) Euler characteristic of $X$ is $$\sum (-1)^k h^k(X) = \sum (-1)^{p+q} h^{pq}(X) = \sum (-1)^{p+q} h^q(X, \Omega^p) = \sum (-1)^p f_{!} \Omega^p.$$ If the Chern roots of the tangent bundle are $r_1$, $r_2$, ... $r_n$, then the Chern character of $\Omega^p$ is $e_p(e^{-r_1}, e^{-r_2}, \ldots, e^{-r_n})$, where $e_p$ is the $p$-th elementary symmetric function. So the Euler characteristic of $X$ is $$\sum (-1)^p f_* \left( e_p(e^{-r_1}, e^{-r_2}, \ldots, e^{-r_n}) t_f \right) = f_* \left( \prod(1-e^{-r_i}) t_f \right).$$ Now, what has class $u$ has the property that $f_*(u)$ is the Euler characteristic of $X$? The top chern class of $T_X$, in other words, $\prod r_i$. So it seems very likely that we should have $$\prod(1-e^{-r_i}) t_f= \prod r_i$$ and $$t_f = \prod \frac{r_i}{1-e^{-r_i}}.$$ That's not a proof, because there are other classes with the same pushforward and because $\prod(1-e^{-r_i})$ is a zero-divisor, but I find it persuasive. 

I don't really understand what you want but what about using a geodesic sphere? Then no more than 6 cells meet at any point. 

As everyone above has pointed out, the expected value is $0$. I expect that the original poster might have wanted to know about how big the determinant is. A good way to approach this is to compute $\sqrt{E((\det A)^2)}$, so there will be no cancellation. Now, $(\det A)^2$ is the sum over all pairs $v$ and $w$ of permutations in $S_n$ of $$(-1)^{\ell(v) + \ell(w)} (1/2)^{2n-\# \{ i : v(i) = w(i) \}}$$ Group together pairs $(v,w)$ according to $u := w^{-1} v$. We want to compute $$(n!) \sum_{u \in S_n} (-1)^{\ell(u)} (1/2)^{2n-\# (\mbox{Fixed points of }u)}$$ This is $(n!)^2/2^{2n}$ times the coefficient of $x^n$ in $$e^{2x-x^2/2+x^3/3 - x^4/4 + \cdots} = e^x (1+x).$$ So $\sqrt{E((\det A)^2)}$ is $$\sqrt{(n!)^2/2^{2n} \left(1/n! + 1/(n-1)! \right)} = \sqrt{(n+1)!}/ 2^n$$ 

In addition to the other great answers, there are some proofs in algebraic geometry where we establish a result about $H^q(X, \mathcal{E})$ by descending induction on $q$: The base case is $q = \dim X$ and then we show Case $q$ implies Case $q-1$. Even if you only care about the result for $H^0$, this may be the best route. The big example is Grothendieck's proof that proper pushforwards of coherent sheaves are coherent. See the discussion before Cor 18.1.15 in Vakil, and related examples throughout Chapter 18. 

For the record, I'll spell out the relation between these notions. Let $f(x+iy) = u(x,y) + i v(x,y)$. Then $$\int_{\gamma} f(z) dz = \int_{\gamma} \left( u(x,y) dx - v(x,y) dy \right) + i \int_{\gamma} \left( u(x,y) dy + v(x,y) dx \right)$$ The right hand side should be thought of as multiplying out $\int_{\gamma} (u(x,y) + i v(x,y)) (dx + i dy)$, a notion which can be made rigorous. 

This can never occur when $G$ is normal. Over a field of characteristic zero, all group schemes are regular, and regular implies normal, so there are no examples over a field of characteristic zero. Recall the universal property of normalization: For any normal variety $Y$, the induced map $\mathrm{DomHom}(Y, \tilde{X}) \to \mathrm{DomHom}(Y,X)$ is bijective, where $\mathrm{DomHom}$ is the dominant homomorphisms. Proof: If $G$ is normal, then $G \times \tilde{X}$ is normal. We have a map $G \times \tilde{X} \to G \times X \to X$, where the first map is $\mathrm{Id} \times \phi$ and the second map is the group action. By the universal property of the normalization, there is a map $G \times \tilde{X} \to \tilde{X}$ making the obvious diagram commute. We claim that this map gives an action of $G$ on $\tilde{X}$. Consider the two maps $G \times G \times \tilde{X} \to \tilde{X}$. We must show they are equal. Again, by the universal property of normalization, it is enough to show that the two compositions $G \times G \times \tilde{X} \to X$ are equal. But these are the same as $G \times G \times \tilde{X} \to G \times G \times X$, follwed by the two maps $G \times G \times X \to X$, and these are equal because $G$ acts on $X$. 

$\def\ZZ{\mathbb{Z}}\def\RR{\mathbb{R}}\def\PP{\mathbb{P}}$I noticed these excellent answers were missing an explicit example of a space $X$ and a class $\eta$ in $H_{\ast}(X, \ZZ)$ such that the image of $\eta$ in $H_{\ast}(X \times X)$ (under the diagonal map) is not in the image of $H_{\ast}(X) \otimes H_{\ast}(X) \to H_{\ast}(X \times X)$. So, for the record, this occurs for the fundamental class of $\mathbb{RP}^3$. Verification We write points of $\RR \PP^3$ in homogenous coordinates as $(w:x:y:z)$. For $t \in [0,1]$, define $$D_t := {\Big \{} ((w_1:x_1:y_1:z_1), (w_2:x_2:y_2:z_2)) \in \RR \PP^3 \times \RR \PP^3 : $$ $$w_2 x_1 = t w_1 x_2,\ x_2 y_1 = t x_1 y_2,\ y_2 z_1 = t y_1 z_2,$$ $$w_2 y_1 = t^2 w_1 y_2,\ x_2 z_1 = t^2 x_1 z_2,\ w_2 z_1 = t^3 z_1 w_2 {\Big \}}$$ and set $D = \bigcup_{t \in [0,1]} D_t$. $D_1$ is the diagonal and, for $t \in (0,1]$, we have $D_t \cong \RR \PP^3$, the equations defining $D_t$ simply say that $(w_2:x_2:y_2:z_2) = (t^3 w_1: t^2 x_1: t y_1: z_1)$. The space $D_0$ is a bit more interesting: the equations are $w_2 x_1 = x_2 y_1 = y_2 z_1 = w_2 y_1 = z_2 x_1 = z_2 w_1=0$, and considering cases shows that $$D_0 = (\RR \PP^3 \times \RR \PP^0) \cup (\RR \PP^2 \times \RR \PP^1) \cup (\RR \PP^1 \times \RR \PP^2) \cup (\RR \PP^0 \times \RR \PP^3).$$ Here $\RR \PP^2 \times \RR \PP^1$, for example, is all points of the form $(\ast: \ast: \ast : 0) \times (0 : 0 : \ast : \ast)$. $D$ is an oriented manifold with corners, whose boundary is $D_1 - D_0$. So $D_1$ is homologous to $D_0$. Put the standard CW-structure on $\RR \PP^3$, writing $C_i$ for the cell of dimension $i$, and write $C_{ij}$ for $C_i \times C_j$. It is easy to compute in this structure that $$H_3 = \ZZ \cdot [C_{30}] \oplus \ZZ \cdot [C_{03}] \oplus (\ZZ/2\ZZ) \cdot ([C_{21}]+[C_{12}]).$$ The image of $\bigoplus_{i+j =3 } H_i(\RR \PP^3) \otimes H_j(\RR \PP^3)$ is the first two summands, and $[D_0] = [C_{30}] + [C_{21}] + [C_{12}] + [C_{03}]$, so $[D_0]$ is not in the image of $\bigoplus_{i+j =3 } H_i \otimes H_j$. (Recall that $H_1(\RR \PP^3) = H_2(\RR \PP^3) = 0$. ) 

I'm reading up on infinite generalizations of the fundamental theorem of distributive lattices. Wikipedia (June 15, 2017) says that there is a duality 

Now, we want to vary the $\mu$'s. So we want to find the minimal value of $\sum \lambda_i \mu_i$ where $\mu_i$ ranges over $n$-tuples obeying $\prod \mu_i = 1$, with $\mu_i$ sorted in the reverse order from $\lambda_i$. (In fact, removing this last condition will not effect the minimum.) By the AM-GM inequality, $\sum \lambda_i \mu_i \geq n \prod \lambda_i^{1/n} \prod \mu_i^{1/n} = n \prod \lambda_i^{1/n}$. We get equality if $\mu_i = \left( \prod \lambda_i \right)^{1/n} / \lambda_i$, and we take $X$ to be diagonal in the same basis where $M$ is diagonal. 

In this answer, I will analyze the case of the Gaussian integers, and explain the peculiar phenomena pointed out in my comment above. So we are considering whether or not $a+bi$ is a square modulo $a-bi$, where $a^2+b^2$ is a prime $p$. As GNiklasch points out in his answer, if $i$ is not a square modulo $a-bi$, then one of $(a+bi)$ and $i(a+bi)$ will be square modulo $a-bi$ and there other will not, so there is no interesting question here. The element $i$ will be square modulo $a+bi$ if and only if there is a primitive $8$-th root of unity in $\mathbb{Z}[i]/(a+bi) \cong \mathbb{F}_p$, so if and only if $p \equiv 1 \bmod 8$. So the interesting problem is when $p \equiv 1 \bmod 8$. It turns out that, in this case, $a-bi$ is always a square modulo $a+bi$. To prove this, we will use quartic reciprocity. If $\pi$ is a Gaussian prime not equal to $1+i$, and $z$ is a Gaussian integer relatively prime to $\pi$, then $\left[ \frac{z}{\pi} \right]$ is defined to be the unique power of $i$ so that $z^{(N(\pi)-1)/4} \equiv \left[ \frac{z}{\pi} \right] \bmod \pi$. We need two key properties: $$\left[ \frac{\overline{\alpha}}{\overline{\beta}} \right] = \overline{ \left[ \frac{\alpha}{\beta} \right] }$$ which is straightforward from the definition and $$\left[ \frac{\alpha}{\beta} \right] \left[ \frac{\beta}{\alpha} \right]^{-1} = (-1)^{\frac{N(\alpha)-1}{4} \cdot \frac{N(\beta)-1}{4}}$$ which is quartic reciprocity. Putting these together, if $a^2+b^2 \equiv 1 \bmod 8$, then $$\left[ \frac{a+bi}{a-bi} \right] = \overline{ \left[ \frac{a-bi}{a+bi} \right]} \ \mbox{and} \ \left[ \frac{a+bi}{a-bi} \right] = \left[ \frac{a-bi}{a+bi} \right].$$ So $\left[ \frac{a+bi}{a-bi} \right] = \pm 1$. This means that the quadratic character $\left( \frac{a+bi}{a-bi} \right)=\left[ \frac{a+bi}{a-bi} \right]^2$ is $1$.
