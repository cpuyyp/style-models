Make the vampire and humans more closly related. So the difference is more vauge. Humans of different cultures already eat blood. $URL$ Black pudding. Bloodpudding... Combine this with canabalism (in history) or events happening in present. You will find it wouldent be so easy to find these vampires. Exactly how they would get their special powers - I do not know. It could have something to do with chemistry or genetics (combined with human blood intake). You also have some people (lunatics) that actually think they are vampires - but no one is bealiving them... No matter how hard they try to act like it. Why don´t we bealive those that actually think they are vampires?!. (Probably it has something to do with that we only would accuse someone a vampire if we fear them/it) Create a distrusting critcal world as well. (I mean no one bealives people who preform cannabalism and drink blood - saying they are vampires). If we do not bealive people that act like vampires - would it really be so hard for the real ones to hide? A human in a culture that consume lots of animal blood - that for some reason are/turn to become a cannibal. He fakes schizophrenia. He comes from a wartorn country with no medical records of him? "A few times he have gotten the illusion that he is a vampire" - psychiatrist. Maybe this actual vampire acts like an idiot that think he is a vampire... etc. A special arranged medcine seem to calm him (but in truth this hides his actual vampirism) - but he only acts calm when he gets it to fool his care takers. Everybody understand this man is a lunatic and we might feel sorry for him - so we do not accuse him of real vampirism (as he dont cause any fear I guess). 

I'm convinced there is a good, physical solution to your problem: If your people are giants, it solves most (all?) identified issues. 1) For giants of sufficient size, truly effective melee weapons would be extremely hard to come by. Larger bodies encounter physical limits on blood pressure/vasculature that make it impossible to accelerate a heavy, bulky melee weapon quickly. So contrary to much existing giant lore, real giants could not kill each other in skilled combat simply by swinging trees around or by incorporating giant boulders into hand-to-hand techniques -- this is simply incompatible with anatomy and physics. 2) Therefore, for real melee dominance, a sword would be required -- yet not just any sword. A razor-sharp and long yet incredibly strong blade would not even be sufficient. You'd also need lightweight, space-age materials to ensure that the blade could be accelerated by large giants up to hand-to-hand combat speeds, using the same kinetic chain motions (hip -> shoulder -> elbow -> wrist) common to golf and tennis swings. Only then, with 20th-21st century technology, would a truly effective close quarters weapon dominate over the putatively traditional wrestling-style combat techniques. Well, but for one major exception... 3) Enter guns: As soon as primitive metallurgy is developed, the resulting heavy materials are no better than fists for the slow, lumbering grip/takedown based wrestling presumably dominating pitched combat encounters between members of the giant species. A massive hunk of metal is even worse for this purpose than the near-useless tree or boulder; small metal spears/atlatls simply can't be accelerated quickly enough to develop primitive ranged weapons, only brass knuckles gain any popularity. But with only a little further technological development, guns quickly become the common soldier's weapon. Finally, the physical constraints on the giant's body are sidestepped via the chemistry of explosives. Giants can carry handcannons to devastating effect. 4) Yet the space-age technology that eventually makes truly effective giant swords a reality has a clear upper hand over the older, widespread giant-sized guns. To propel a projectile large enough to kill a giant, and with the gun's chamber being subject to quadratic forces, the chamber must be reinforced to a proportionally much greater degree than the small guns we know. This means they are extremely heavy, even for giants. They can't be aimed quickly, so there is no giant equivalent of the carbine or assault rifle. A futuristic, strong/lightweight/long blade in the hand of a well-trained king/queen would allow them to waltz into a room full of armed guards and summarily dispense cold justice before the guards had properly trained their sights (remember, in close quarters guns need not only to pivot/rotate, but also to translate so that the chamber can properly align with a moving point-blank target -- easier said than done when your gun is a 3000 lb chunk of metal). 5) Worth noting: It's possible that in a world with much higher gravity than Earth, normal human sized people would face these same physical constraints that giants would on Earth. Though it's difficult to deeply extrapolate how an extreme gravity condition might have impacted the evolution of life. But such a factor is much more easily handwaved away than lots of the showstopping issues so elaborately discussed in other answers. 

Take look at Oscillation. Hertz. Demateralization. Nanotechnology. (We can even today do molecular thin layers of things) Our computer processor today run at 3000000000 Hertz. Thats the amounts of times up and own/on and off/circular motion. I guess the big problem is to put everyhing back into place. And how to activate a brain dead person? Maybe you could tune the mind in after some time. The brain waves have to be the same. Maybe a computer program will preform a proxamiation that will in the end be so close to the original mind that it dosen´t matter. The character might experience this as dreams - that suddenly crashes - A new dream will start to continue a bit longer but only to crash again - with no memories of the former dream. The original mind prior to the whole process was saved. The brainwaves results of countless of small expriments (brain reaction to events) made by the computer - and longterm memory. When the brain starts to work - it compares it to the saved brain data (and brain wave functions) - and shut down - to redo process until it is on a whole the same as the original. When it comes rematerizaltion. Thats a tough one. There is extreme amounts of atoms in a human body. It would be near impossible if not impossible to save such data - of how they are built up. After all life is quiet old. And I guess our atoms is as many as planets and stars in our universe or something like that. I suggest the character (characters mind) would have to be inserted in a new body - or a clone (that have gotten through similar life events in a simulated enviroment). If you want more realism I think you might want to skip the container. If you stay with the container - maybe the atoms and molecules are used (turned into water and oxygen - and cole to to CO2 - for plants to breath to become food for the clone). Basically you characters materia would be recycled into a clone tha becomes himself again. You could also take a look at this and use it somehow. $URL$
