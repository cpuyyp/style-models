You generally don't see bikes sold with drops and suspension (but people do build them). Cross bikes are rigid (though in amateur cross, some people will bring in mountain bikes). Suspension forks are only useful on the road for people who have back problems or are old or something which necessitates the need for a light use front suspension fork to iron out some more bumps. Most people are best served by putting on bigger tires and a less aggressive setup on a rigid bike. Depending on the quality of your rigid diamondback and if you still have it, you may want to try fitting it with some fat, smooth tires or tires like the Geax Evolution (marketed as slight dirt use but primarily road use) and try taking it out again. 400-500 miles isn't a lot either (20-25 days of commuting), so I'm guessing theres also the getting used to riding around thing - a bike isn't like lying in bed. You can also play with saddles and grips and get a bike fit for comfort - that will probably matter more than your fork type. According to their website, Planet X markets the XLS as a "Stiff, responsive race-ready cyclocross machine" and its listed as non-mudflap and non pannier rack compatible. Those aren't characteristics of a good commuter. A carbon fiber fork helps on some bikes in killing buzzing sensations, but its not going to change the purpose of a bike. Some cyclocross bikes do make good commuters, but they aren't typically cyclocross bikes marketed as race machines -- moreso things like the Trek Crossrip (some race-ish bikes do work as commuters though, like Kona's Jake the Snake). Its usually clear from the component spec, geometry and what not if its intended to race or to commute on. I was looking at the Planet X Kaffenback 2 for a while personally which looked to be a better commuter (but they weren't responsive to my questions and it would have been an international order). Unless you have back problems or something which necessitates the use of shocks, I think a bike which takes non-skinny tires and has a more relaxed geometry is a good place to go with or without a carbon fork (this should only serve as relatively minor differentiation). If you want drops, look at something like the old Kona Dew Drop, but for 10 miles each way, a flat bar hybrid would work for most people as well, like the Trek 7.3 FX. Take them out for a spin on similar terrain to the commute and see what you like. People can, should and still do commute on rigid bikes. If you really feel like you need front suspension after trying out some hybrids (like the Trek 7.3fx, which does fine on light offroad stuff like fire roads) or drop bar commuters (Kona Dew Drop or Trek Crossrip (even though its marketed as a cross bike, its really not a race machine)) or even some touring bikes like the Trek 520 (which has a very nice geometry), go for a hybrid with front suspension, like the Trek 8.3 ds, though I'm not sure how much bounce there will be for someone whose 90kg. Good old rigid mountain bikes are also fine for 10 miles with good tires (like an old Specialized Rockhopper/Hardrock), and they're cheap and discrete (so they make ideal commuters) which can do a bit of fun. 

The hanger is part of the frame in this case. This is a pretty common design, though many newer frames will have the hanger as a removable part of the frame that can be replaced if damaged. In the case of your bike, if there is damage, you have to (carefully) bend it back to shape. 

No, Trek will not sell you just the frame if they don't offer it in their product lineup. And a bike shop wouldn't either, given that they have to buy the whole bike anyway. It's just a massive headache to allow things like that for manufacturers. And many manufacturers generally aren't all too keen on letting people sell their bikes online (accessories are fine to some extent). Moreover, why would you put Di2 on a crossrip? It's frame isn't designed for it (e.g. mounting the battery), and its quite low end compared to what people would run Di2 on (a Di2 groupset costs more than most of the crossrip models out there, as complete bikes!) 

You should try a professional bike fit. Just because you are 179 cm doesn't mean a 56 is right for you (the sizing of a bike with a given number varies on the type of bike and manufacturer and model). Normally, when you switch to drop bars, you will be sore (but pain is different, and should be alarming, though going for a 40 minute ride while just starting out may be a bit much). The geometry of the bike can also cause problems - racers may cause more pain than touring bikes due to their more aggressive geometry, for example. Here are some tips from sheldon brown on pain, and what to do about it. 

It's pretty normal for a bicycle with a freewheel/freehub to turn the wheel backwards a little bit when pedaling backwards a bit (i.e. if you turn the pedals backwards pretty quickly, you get some very slow backwards turning of the wheel) when the bike is in a stand/lifted in the air. You can sometimes get rid of this by servicing/replacing the freehub/freewheel. If the wheel is turning backwards reasonably quickly when pedaling backwards, the freehub/freewheel is shot and you need a new one. As for the chain becoming loose when backpedaling, there could be several causes: 

Assuming the wheel is good (is fully seated and centered properly in the dropouts and is true; if you spin it along its axis, there shouldn't be lateral movement) you shouldn't be running a tire that rubs on the frame. This can eat out the paint of the frame, the frame, and/or the tire. Try moving to a different tire (possibly a smaller one, like a 700x23) if the wheel is good. Remember that you need some space between the tire and the frame, since the bicycle flexes under load (damaged frames can flex more than the undamaged frame, so might be something to check up on). 

They are a bit hard to find, but if you look, you can find 25.4 clamp which can mount mtb components (like $URL$ and some 31.8 clamp bars like the On-One Bingo (I don't know if this is still made, but it existed at one point). However, the simplest way to get some bullhorn advantages while running mtb components is to start with a mtb flat/riser bar and add some bar ends (not bar end shifters, but something like the Ergon GP5 without the grips) - this gives you a bit more spacing options for placing the shifters+brakes. There are also now cable actuated hydraulic disc brakes (like the TRP Hy/Rd) which may be worth looking at (though obviously, replacing mechanical disc brakes (which are quite good these days) lets things like interrupter levers and what not work but that doesn't solve your problem). 

Assuming you've got the right direction you're turning and its still not budging, use some penetrating oil and/or borrow a breaker bar/vise (and use it carefully). One of the things with your style of tool vs the park tool style of tool is that you can't get as much torque on. In the case of aluminium, its conceivable that theres some corrosion, but dissolving it or heating it might be tricky depending on other types of materials involved. 

Also, if you're using a 47 cm frame and it has 700c wheels, you can also get a reduction in gearing (and height) by switching to 650b wheels (easy if you have disc brakes; bit more work if you have rim brakes, but might be possible). My personal view is people below 5'5" ish shouldn't be riding 700c wheels. 

You may have a sort of systematic effect, such as debris (puncture causing material) near the patch site, or missing rim tape or something depending on where the patch is. It may not be easy to find the causing material unless the tire is flexed under load though, which is why you might just not see it. Either that, or you're consistently not applying the patch right (which you just need to follow the directions in the patch kit). 

There isn't all that much point. We have a lot of knowledge on how to make steel tough. It's also pretty cheap. This basically makes it win-win for manufacturers: use enough tough steel in a good structure with a good locking mechanism to get a decent lock. It doesn't cost a lot and its easy to fabricate. The weight of many good locks is not that much to begin with; the main design goals with a U-lock is to leave as little space as possible to get a jack in, hard enough to cut, and has a proper lock mechanism. So, locks like the Kryptonite Evo Mini line are very good for many locking jobs and don't weigh all that much (about 1.5 lbs for the Mini 6). So, there's not all that much point in reducing weight. There are some locks which are not steel -- Tigr makes titanium locks, for example. But they're less well known and twice the price of a high quality steel lock, such the well tested Kryptonite New York Lock line. And the smaller units don't necessarily hold up. 

Its likely that your bad shifting is due to messed up cables or a misadjusted derailleur. You can either cut the cable crimp off at the end of the cable with a pair of pliers, or pull it off with a pair of pliers. As for replacing the cable housing, you can either get your bike shop to cut a piece of housing of the right length by taking your old housing to them, and cleaning up the cut with a file + awl so its flat and the hole is completely open, or you can buy housing kits from companies like Jagwire and cut it yourself (but you will need a bicycle specific cable+housing cutter like Park Tool CN-10 or a dremel to cut the housing properly). There is a nice tutorial on how to replace your housing here. Another good page on prepping housing is here. As for replacing just the housing vs replacing the housing + the cable, its generally a good idea to just replace the housing + the cable, just because its not all that much more expensive and if your cable has some rust on it or has been damaged, it may lead to poor shifting even with new housing. I always replace the cable and housing together, just to avoid problems. EDIT: I zoomed in on the picture. The cable is toast. Get a new cable. 

What you want to look at is the gearing. Let's consider a regular derailleur-based bicycle such as this (source): 

Folders are more likely to go wrong than full sized frames, particularly due to the hinge that allows the bike to fold (this can become loose/damaged). Since folders are more complicated than regular frames and a niche product, you have to pay more to get a folder of equivalent quality than a regular frame and it doesn't really make sense to warranty something thats more fragile for as long. That being said, some manufacturers do offer 5 year warranties -- Dahon, for example. But you do have to have periodic maintenance records and what not. In any case, regardless of what the warranty says, its more important to have a manufacturer who builds solid bicycles. Standing behind the warranty is another good trait -- Having a 10000 year warranty is useless if you can't actually use it in the case of a defect. And if something goes wrong that isn't a defect (like you were riding around with the hinge not being tight or something), note that the warranty won't cover you. Also, remember things like lifetime warranties are for the bike's useful expected life, not yours. 

On Shimano SPD pedals, you can sometimes adjust the tension for how tightly they clip in (likely via a hex bolt). If the tension is too low, your feet will be too easy to pop out, whereas if its too high, you won't easily be able to get out (which isn't a problem on an indoor cycling setup). Try playing with this setting to see if you stay clipped in (turning the bolt clockwise should increase the tension). Also, there are two types of cleats available -- single release (Shimano SH-51) which only release by turning your heel out and multi-release (Shimano SH-56) which release by turning in any direction. It shouldn't matter which one you use for indoor cycling (SH-56 is probably preferable for most people) but SH-51 might be an option if you're having trouble with SH-56. If you can't get the tension to adjust and swapping the cleats doesn't work (if you're using SH-56), normally indoor cycling bikes have toe clips available as well. You may want to use those. And work on your form. 

If you have a freewheel (which it seems like you have on the BSO), and theres anything wrong with it, the solution is to replace it (if those directions don't work, you can try this method). In general, they're not user serviceable parts. My guess is that you have some pawls stuck or something. A stopgap measure that might work is dumping wd-40 or similar into/around the freewheel. In any case, the repair will be the same -- buy a new freewheel, a freewheel remover tool and install a new freewheel on. 

You can use a crankset thats market for 8 speed with a 9 speed group. Im assuming the 8 speed 105 cranks are already on the bike so thats one job done. Personal preference. Hilly means different things to different people. Note the derailleur will provide some constraints due to its chain capacity and maximum cog size. But for hills, you want lower gearing (larger cogs). 

Normally I see these listed as bike minus wheels. Maybe tag it as frameset and complete bike minus wheels. Look at comparable listings, but there isn't really an established term AFAIK.
