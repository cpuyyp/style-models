I appreciate the opportunity and offer, but after further consideration, I cannot relocate at this time for personal reasons. If a local position becomes available, please keep me in mind as I really do greatly like the company and what they do. If they do come back with a "but you knew it would require relocation!!!", reply with "I did and I apologize. After further consideration, relocating at this time is not right for me or my family." Either they will accept it or they wont. 

Feel not only comfortable talking about projects you've worked on but exhibit a bit of passion for it. We've all seen where you start talking to someone about something they are interested in and there is a bit of a spark. Have projects you are working on outside an academic setting. It might be open source software or Arduino or Raspberry Pi or whatever... have a technical hobby project you are working on. There is nothing wrong with not knowing something, but know and be able to explain how you'd learn about it. Be friendly and polite. It should not require being stated, but there have been so many interviews where this was not the case... so many... 

Contracts ending are normal in software development. I see many resumes each week with a bunch of three to twelve month employment stints; perfectly normal if the person was a contractor. So, I don't think you should worry about the "only nine months long and not a long-term engagement" part. If asked about the contract, focus on the technology. If they ask about the project in non-technical terms, tell them there were some challenges, what the challenges were (without being too critical), how you/the team overcame them, what you learned, and explain how it made you better at your job. Do not speak ill of the employer or the other employees. It just makes you look bad. 

With those points in mind, have a conversation with your employer and politely tell them you won't be coming into work on the date of your birthday. If this goes well, then great, you can have your birthday off. If you get the sense they will fire you if you take your birthday off (in spite of you following the rules), you need to weigh up whether taking your birthday off is worth your job to you. Once you've figured that out, act on it. 

It's likely the recruiter/interviewer will ask you your notice period, and that's where you can be honest and understand whether it's a dealbreaker. If you have the time and headspace, interviews are generally good practice and teach you stuff, whatever the outcome. You've got nothing to lose by attending the interview, showing them your interest and being truthful about (essentially) your notice period. For all you know, their recruitment processes could put back the start date. It's difficult to know this from the offset, but if you're keen on the role, it's worth finding out, and it could go your way. 

It's easy to add publications to your profile on LinkedIn (and it can generate a pdf CV for you); generally I think it's a good idea. I would say mostly it depends on the role you are applying for with that CV (if not speculative) If they are interested in articles or the content of those articles, then definitely. If your views in those articles goes against what the company stands for (if this is applicable) then perhaps don't mention them. For example, if one of your articles criticises corporate culture and your CV is viewed by a corporate recruiter... perhaps think again. 

I've been a dev supervisor/manager for over ten years. The fact is that most students didn't learn the exact tools that we work with; even if you are self taught on what you think the tools are that companies use, you most likely have several large gaps of knowledge. This should be expected. I feel there are things that make a new grad really stand out. 

The "other candidates" mentioned likely fell through and they couldn't retain them. This is a very common occurrence. If there is nothing else that caused you concerns, I would not worry too much. However, two full days of interviewing seems questionable. 

The problem is that many acronyms have multiple meanings. You/your company should create a standard definition sheet that covers what is used within your field. If this is a more generic question, then I'd say use $URL$ 

With this said, being self-taught in tools puts you above your peers in your graduation class that didn't better themselves similarly (most of them for sure). Being self taught is certainly a strength as it shows you want to go above and beyond the minimum. This in itself demonstrates three of the key differentiators I listed above. 

If you have a phone number, call them to see if there is anything remaining you need to do and if not when you should show up and where. If not, send them back another email and explain that if you do not hear back from them, you'll have to consider other opportunities. Be very polite. After sending said email, start looking for other opportunities immediately in case they never respond or respond back that they are not longer interested. 

This is where you have to go the extra mile. Look up some free courses on Coursera or Udemy that are relevant to your current (and possibly future) role and take them. Look for something that offers a certificate and show it to your supervisor. 

The management team is interested in dollars and cents, so give that to them. Show them the dollars and sense of a new set up (sorry, couldn't help myself). Pair up with someone who can create a cost-benefit analysis regarding your needs. 

Speaking as a former server, this isn't bad. Restaurants operate in a much different fashion than other businesses. When you go home is relative to the amount of business. My schedule only listed in-times and not out-times. I never knew exactly when I'd be off. Sometimes I would be out early if we were slow, sometimes I stayed as late as the closing servers (along with two or three others). The trial shift could be likened to a technical interview or a programming exercise. Think of it as a technical screening. They are looking for new wait-staff that either have experience or raw talent that can be honed into the type of employee they are looking for. Take what they said at face value. I would say wait until Thursday before you call them and see where they stand in the interview process. Also, ask for the manager that was on duty during your trial shift if they are available. If not, ask for the store manager. When you do call them, make sure it is on their down time. Down time depends on the type of restaurant, but for a dinner-heavy service, I would say 2:00 - 3:00 PM is a good time frame. That makes sure that they are fully out of any lunch rush and well ahead of any dinner rush. 

There are some great answers here, but I thought I could contribute a bit. At my last job I was a process management engineer when I started. This meant taking measurements and time studies of processes in an effort to improve them. After a short period on the job, I was able to refine and automate the processes so much (mine and the ones I monitored) that I was promoted and moved into a more promising career path within the company. What I've learned in my work experience: 

Be eager and proactive in asking what additional work duties you can take on Do not get idle. If you are not given tasks to replace the ones you automate, find ones that benefit the company and yourself (in that order). 

Never make yourself indispensable. Doing so means it is isn't possible to move up or onto something different. If you can automate much of your job, you should. You can almost never have too many people that make things more reliable and lessen maintenance. These people pay for themselves over and over. Automating tedious parts of your job leave you available for more interesting tasks. Automating work saves the company money year over year for a one time expenditure. Obviously, there is a variable return on the investment, but in general, it's better to automate. People that take initiative in solving their work problems are not that common. Most people follow the motions and work within set parameters. These people are easily replaced and add minimal value. 

My answer is one-fold: Accept the promotion. You've pushed for it and earned it, so accept it. It's your employer's responsibility to keep you happy in your role and if the promotion isn't it, then they need to work with you on that. You are within your right to go and find a better role elsewhere when you see fit. This answers B) too. Voil√†, you've got the promotion, so you can move on from not having that as something that is holding you back. If your job hunt fails for whatever reason, you're better off than where you started. 

I think you're completely right to do this and sounds like you've prepared a great agreement for your case. I would prepare yourself for them telling you there isn't a budget for it, and that they aren't willing to pay you (or someone else) to make those changes. They may tell you it's a great idea, and that they'd rather you do it outside, or on the side of, your main role. Which is good for getting what you want done, but ultimately adds to your responsibilities and puts pressure on your juggling skills. They might be thinking, it's always worked this way so why should we spend money on this now? That's a hard mindset to change and you might need to prepare yourself for the fact that they may not change it, unless it actually breaks the deliverables. It sounds like this issue is affecting a customer and that may be enough to have them interested. Either way, stick to your guns, especially as you have analysis to back your argument up. Remind them that you are ultimately asking that this is put in place and you're not just going to run with the idea.
