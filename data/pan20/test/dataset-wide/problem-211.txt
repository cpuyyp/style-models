So if the Baltic never became a sea, if we still have the ancient Baltic Plain, would it have any major differences to European climate, landscape and culture? 

At 950 feet tall and 820 wide, this dome would have easily enveloped Saint Peter's Basilica. Beacon of Progress 

Eccentricity (orbital shape): Varying between 0.000055 and 0.0679 over the course of 100,000 years. Obliquity (axial tilt): Varying between 22.1 and 24.5 degrees over the course of 41,000 years. Axial precession (change in the orientation of the rotational axis on a rotating body): Polaris being the North Star for a total of 26,000 degrees. 

Throughout pre-Roman history, North Africa and the Middle East had its fair share of civilizations--not just the popular Egyptians, but also the Carthaginians, the Sumerians, the Assyrians, the Babylonians and the Hittites. The reason that there were so many civilizations in so small area sizes is simple--they built their cities in deserts! Even on the Mediterranean coast, the environments in Israel, Syria, Lebanon, Jordan and Iraq are so extreme that farming and irrigation would require an extra degree of ingenuity. Things are no better off in the Sahara, either. Highs average around 104 degrees Fahrenheit, it is sandy mixed with rocky and the Nile, as far as I know, is the only river that can cut through the desert rock and sand and to the Mediterranean. In this alternate Africa, things are a little different. For starters, North Africa is 100% rock, which means none of the sand dunes that made Arabia or the Sahara so notorious.

Limited duration. Dad's influence gradually wears off, and therefore needs to be renewed regularly. Given that his other powers are inactive during the day, this renewal probably could only happen at night. It could be a daily requirement, or however often makes sense with the story—every three days, every full moon, etc. Limited geographic reach. Dad maintains control, but only for a given distance between them. This would give an excuse for him to be very over-protective, forbidding school trips and such. Influence depends on a blood exchange of some sort. Especially in combination with 1 above, Dad either needs to bite Daughter, or feed her his blood, or both. Another vampire whammied her. If #3 is a little too squicky, perhaps Vamp Mom was actually responsible for the imperative, feeding her the compulsion with Mother's Milk/Blood. This would have happened in infancy, and could be gradually wearing off. It could be a special thing Mom did because she knew she wouldn't be around to help Dad raise Daughter, or it could be a regular part of Vampire child-rearing and coming-of-age. Depending on the father-daughter dynamic, Dad could be dreading the day she comes out from under the influence, or could be frustrated that he can't be himself with her, or anything in between. 

The problem is not the bird, the problem is the food. It must also stay airborne and be present in sufficient amounts. However even a dust size plant would eventually sink down in the Earth atmosphere. 

If the creature needs to grow and reproduce, a matter is required to build the new parts. Just energy itself is not enough. Because of that, plants need minerals and nitrogen from the soil and also take oxygen, carbon and hydrogen from the surrounding air. If no growth or reproduction is required, a living (= running typical metabolism of the living organism, capable of regeneration and possibly limited growth with expense of some other part dying and decomposing) system can be self-contained. A single usual plant would probably survive in a closed system with enough sunlight, sufficient initial amount of water and minerals and some bacteria and fungi to convert the dead parts into usable minerals. 

The theories that say aliens should look similar to us assume the evolutional analogy. Whale is somewhat similar to fish, and bat is somewhat similar to bird, just because it seems the most optimal form for the way of living. There are still a number of important differences remaining because of the different evolution path. So two legs, two hands and most important receptors (sound, vision) at the highest point, double vision and sound receptors for stereo perception, and the brain as close to the receptors as possible - seems making sense if we assume evolution leave no redundant organs like a third eye. 

It's common knowledge that the atmosphere of Venus is too inhospitable for a proper landing. The most concerning problem with that is pressure. Venus's atmospheric pressure is said to be 92 times heavier than Earth's. Despite this, according to Basic Planet, Venus boasts some impressive geography: 

A four-chambered heart, something also found in birds and mammals A unidirectional respiratory system A semi-erect posture, midway between the legs of mammals and birds (which were straightly tucked underneath their bodies) and those of other reptiles (which splay away from the body, resulting in a respiratory issue called "carrier's constraint") 

Back home, the Pleistocene ice never reached farther south than New York or London. These ice ages had been coming and going for two and a half million years. On average, there was enough ice to suck down 100 meters of sea level. In this alternate Earth, the ice ages had been coming and going for five million years. In Europe, we'd see ice reaching as far down south as Paris and as far west as London, and even burying all of Russia, stopping on the slopes of the Urals and the Caucasus, barring Asia from Europe. In North America, the Laurentide Ice Sheet reached as far down south as Topeka, Kansas and as far west as Rapid City, South Dakota. The Cordilleran Ice Sheet never reached beyond the Canadian Rockies, the Cascades or the Alaska Range. Sea levels dropped by 120-150 meters. In this alternate ice age, what would the Mercator look like with far lower drops in sea level? How would climate and habitat be affected? And when we get to interglacial, would the landscapes look any different from what we currently have? If so, how? 

Regardless how hot or cold the star is, you can always place a planet into acceptable climate conditions by just putting it into the right distance. This will impact the duration of the year: for the small cold star, the planet must be closer so the year will be shorter (see orbital period). This depends much less on the mass of the planet as it is very light in comparison to the star anyway. As the life takes long time to evolve, it should probably be a stable star from the main sequence, burning hydrogen, not helium or anything the like. Other stages of stellar evolution (like red giants or cooling dwarfs) may be too short for creating life "from scratch" but would still fit if the planet has been colonized later. 

Insects are sometimes viewed as currently dominant taxonomic group. They may have social behavior, hierarchies, bees can communicate each other the location and build relatively complex structures like honeycomb. These families may be superior to human families as they consist of big number of adult, fully capable individuals, not just of two adults and children who cannot do much. The only problem is the small size (so limited size of the brain), but say Hercules beetle may be 17 cm long so the brain need not be very small. Titan beetle is slightly shorter but has more massive body. The problem is probably that social insects are not as big as these beetles. Also, it may possible to have distributed brain built from brains of multiple individuals, using sound or electromagnetic waves to communicate. A bee brain contains about 950 000 neurons, human has about 100 billion. 105 000 bees would be required to have the same number of neural cells. That much can easily live in just two hives standing nearby (60 000 per hive) - fully realistic. It may be only a question of time before the nature hits that opportunity. 

Vampire Dad has one more traditional vampire characteristic: Hypnosis/mind control Vamp Daughter could be hypnotized or otherwise magicked to notice only what Vamp Dad wants her to notice. In order to make this a little less convenient, and allow for the eventual big reveal, the power could be limited in some more-or-less traditional way: 

1. Social Sciences influence religion One possibility that I don't think has been proposed: A scientific understanding of the social nature of humans, combined with a continued belief that God(s) created humans in his/her/their image, might lead people to the conclusion that God must be multiple. That is, if a single human-type omnipotent being existed, your society might believe that that Being would inevitably create peers to stave off human-type loneliness. (This basic human need for companionship1 is apparently the plot of a current movie2; science in first link, spoilers in second.) 2. Religious syncretism3 Alternatively, religious tolerance and cultural relativism could lead to a situation where various religions, including monotheistic ones, have been amalgamated into a single pan-theistic religion, where multiple gods from multiple faiths are now given credence. This would be especially likely if the culture is fairly cosmopolitan—for example, if humanity split off into space colonies that lost track of one another for a while and developed individual religions, but is now once again reunited through the miracle of fft travel and/or communication. Under this scheme, perhaps not all individuals worship all the gods equally, but they acknowledge all gods' validity even while being most devoted to a particular god or set of gods. Note that this is not that different from how some religions have dealt with competing philosophies over the centuries—e.g. ancient Egyptians incorporated deities4 from neighboring pantheons, early Catholicism allegedly co-opted some Pagan deities5 as Saints, Islam considers Jesus6 to have been a prophet, and many modern Americans agree to some sort of sentiment equating various religions7. 

It turns out that a single strand of human hair measures 17 to 181 millionths of a meter wide. But anyone who creates or reinvents a fictional species of humanoid has the freedom to change the dimension of the head, including the size of a strand of hair (if they choose to still have hair.) So in an alternate world, we share that world with another species of Homo, one that still has hair on its head, only that each strand now measures 1/2-1 inch in diameter. The question isn't what the hair would look like--I'm imagining a bunch of leaflike lobes--but what kinds of adaptive advantages such hairs can have for the wearers? Oh, and by the way, the hair in the question is focused on the head, nowhere else. 

Note here that bamboo makes up the vast majority of modern jungle plants. Before I ask you my question, let me answer a question that you might be asking--how could this jungle have such a low diversity? 

Its last eruption was in the late 1910s, over half a century before the more culturally prominent Mount Saint Helens, which is situated in the same mountain chain. Its proximity to the Pacific Plate makes Lassen taller than the Yellowstone plateau--10,457 feet above sea level. In this alternate scenario, a combination of Pacific subduction and a stationary mantle plume turned what we'd have called Lassen Peak into an alternate, Californian Yellowstone. Would this combination have affected local elevation in any way? 

I suggest to use some concurrent versioning system like CVS, SVN or GIT. These are used by software developers to write program texts and are freely and readily available on GitHub, for instance. They already support all needed security and can be quite user friendly (see overview of user friendly interfaces). They allow to setup the following development process: 

A tester, for developing a new product for humans that must be tested on human as an emotional or biological being. Is this sequence of sounds a good music? Does this election candidate speech sound impressive? Are these controls of the new device convenient? A machine could produce some test music, test text and test controls, but without human trying and evaluating, the result may be bearable but will be inferior. So at least human tester is required. A human creator has benefit over machine because an artist can create and try many things in imagination only, saving lots of time that would be required to create a real specimen and present it for others to evaluate. There is already an answer that the art may be such a job, but does not actually explain why and the current answer does not cover exclusively art. 

This depends on how dense do they are. If it is a density of a polystyrene foam with very thin hard covering, then horns on the usual "mythological" size like this are not a problem; could probably even be larger. A cone with 10 cm radius at the base and 50 cm height should weight only about 200 g if made from a polystyrene foam. It would already look like a really large horn.
