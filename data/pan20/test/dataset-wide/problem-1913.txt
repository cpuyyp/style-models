This is just something you'll probably have to learn to deal with. The most you can do is try your hardest to be nice to these people and make friends, but unfortunately, no one can really be forced to be your friend, if they don't like you, there's not a whole lot you can do. Now if they're causing a stir, bullying you, making fun of you, whatever, then you could always take it to your manager. Now if they're cold to the point where it's making it hard for you to do your job because they simply won't talk to you or acknowledge you, then you also have a problem, but if they're simply just not making any effort to be your friend, there's not a whole lot you can do. The best advice I could give is to just keep trying, say hi to them in the halls, try and spark up a conversation with one of them sometime about something you enjoy, or might know they enjoy. Try to be personable even if they aren't that way back to you. If they don't warm up to you, then it's on them, not you. Just be the best you can be, do your work, get things done, and just remember you have friends outside of work. 

I would think about sending a polite email to everyone, except the boss, and be upfront. Don't mention the law or any of that, just spell out that when they smoke in front of the entrance with the door cracked, it stinks up your office and makes it difficult to concentrate on your own work. Ask them to please always smoke as if the boss were there, even when she isn't. Start out with the non-threatening and polite request and see what happens. I would not go to the boss first thing. I don't think anything that disrupts your own ability to work is something to avoid, after all, if you are unable to perform your job to your fullest ability, you are depriving your company of whatever it is you do, AND it could, in the final tally, cost your job. I still wouldn't go 'snitch' to the boss, first thing. It's your issue, and their cause. Take it up with them, first. If you don't get anywhere, then take it to the boss, and let her quote the law. Or you can mention it in passing to your boss (hey, it's hard to concentrate on work when they leave the door open to smoke, did you know their actually supposed to smoke way over there?). Another thing you could recommend, depending on where your office is, is an external phone buzzer on a timer, so that when the office is closed it does not ring. This would alert the smokers that the phone is ringing from a distance. 

Short answer: No, don't put this on your resume. Long answer: Just because you were let go during the trial period, due to slower than normal adaptation to the job, doesn't necessarily mean you're bad at what you do. Maybe you just take longer to grasp all the ideals that the company has for their employees. This can lead to you being let go, as you are not "perfect" in their eyes. Now, knowing that yourself, doesn't mean everyone will see it that way when you walk into an interview. Even if you explain what happened, they might just assume you're putting yourself in a positive light instead of telling them what really happened. I would say leave the job off your resume and just go from there. Build your resume up on your strengths and past employment that you performed well in. The people who read your resume will only see that you lasted in your previous job for a month, and they'll wonder why, possibly might kill your chances of getting an interview. Again, don't get down on yourself. Each company has different expectations of their employees, some expect you to be a pro within a week, some expect it's going to take longer to get settled in and they understand things can take time, especially for a new employee. Just keep working hard and keep your resume focused on the good. 

If this were me, I would respectfully request a meeting with my supervisor and bring up the start- and end-times as the main topic. During the conversation bring up the fact that the clock you all use is inaccurate, but it is what you use, both for the start and end times of your day. Then I would ask how many hours a day you are expected to work. Let your supervisor tell you his expectations. Finally, ask your supervisor to specify your start and end times. So let's say that he says you are to work 8 hours, with lunch, so 8.5 hours. Your day should be 9 to 5:30. If he states that he expects you to work from 8:45 to 5:45, then you know his expectations. Again, if this were me, I would very respectfully state that since those are your expectations of me, that "those are the hours I will work, however please realize that you are asking me to work an extra half hour per day unpaid." Whether or not you choose to actually work the extra time, unpaid, is, in the end, up to you. You are free to quit, and he is free to fire you. Please also realize that my answer is assuming you actually work all day long and don't spend a significant amount of time on facebook, texting, or surfing the Interwebz... 

If you've already explained your situation to them, and they still can't or won't be flexible, then you're out of luck. You don't really have any "rights" when it comes to interviewing, they can choose whether or not they want to be flexible, they don't "owe" you anything as you're not employed. So no, you don't have any rights, and it's probably best to just forget this job, or find a way to have someone watch over your Aunt while you interview. 

I would definitely talk to the boss about your situation and see what he is thinking. You may have given your boss the impression that you're not to be counted on to work, and they may have the wrong idea. You should ask your boss for a closed door meeting, where you can discuss what happened to you on that first day, and explain why it happened. Let him know that you are able to work, and are willing to do what you need to do to prove to him that you are to be counted on, and you will be at work when they call. He may just have the wrong idea, so the worst thing you can do is just let this go and hope for a good outcome. You need to address this, don't be confrontational, don't storm in and demand to know if you're being fired. Just ask for a meeting, talk to him about your situation, and maybe you'll find out they just didn't need you for those few days. It's always a good idea to just talk it out. Also, as Vers said, you should probably consider also just starting to look for a new job as well, as if being gone a day or 2 gets your boss mad enough to fire you, after all you've done for them in winter times, then maybe it's not a company worth your time to stay with. 

I am an employee of a large defense industry company and am on a contract to provide IT services to a large government defense agency. I've been a contractor now for 18 years in various companies. All of the companies I've worked for fit what I'm going to say below, to a T. Note that I've never worked in a pure civilian-side position (non-defense, non-government) in any of my last 30 years of employment. All of that aside, I can only speak for my division of my company and the requirements we get from our government customer. There is only one no heck requirement: Security+ or an equivalent from a short list of certifications. That's it. As far as education goes, every single IT job (not counting upper management, of course, which aren't IT as much as management) requires a Bachelor's Degree (of some kind) or anywhere from 5-9 years experience. Recognize that no where in that last paragraph did I say anything about where the degree is/was from. 

I was volunteering for a non-profit for three years until I was asked to join the board a few months ago. The Exec. Director and I work very well together. The board comprises of his parents and a sibling. All I generally get along with exception with the sibling. Mother of the ED have worked on personal projects together and those ended in disasters. Things fell apart after joining the board. The intense conflict and drama stressed me out to the point where the interactions with these people triggered anxiety attacks, loss of appetite, and cardiac symptoms. The conflicts triggered a cardiac event which required a hospital stay. I got into a heated e-mail exchange with the mother of the Exec Dir who sits on the board (I took her comments on my work too personally). My professional composure failed and I made a personal attack on her. Then notified the ED that I will be resigning. Since the ED is a close friend, I agreed to stay on long enough to get their new website redesigned. Now one of the Board members is extremely angry at me and refuses to communicate with me. She tried to coerce an apology out of me when I was not ready to give an apology because I was still angry at her. I've made several attempts to rebuild bridges over the past weeks. But she won't return my calls. Instead it appears that she's using my friendship with the ED as a bargaining chip to getting what she wants. This as adversely affected my friendship. Given these tactics and her willingness to go the nuclear option, I fear that I will be sued. In an attempt to repair the relationship with that Board member, I left a rather humiliating apology on her voicemail where I expressed self-hatred. The relationship didn't improve but has escalated where she sends e-mails with an aggressive tone using the ED's e-mail account. This caused a severe strain on the relationship between my friend and myself. I handed off my last deliverable last Thursday. Someone misplaced it and I was blamed for not meeting the deliverable date. It's supposed to be their problem because they're migrating the site off a server I run. As that Board member migrates the site to a new webhost and runs in to problems, I fear getting more demanding e-mails and calls. And a potential law suit. I just want my piece of mind back and put this behind me. What should I do to handle this situation better? Should I hire a professional conflict mediation to help that Board member and myself address our conflicts in an attempt to mend fences? Should I stop responding to their calls and e-mails with risk of losing a good friendship? Should I be hiring a lawyer and channel communications between me and the other party? 

I'm not overly happy in my current work environment. The people are good, the hours are perfect, the amount of flexibility I have is nice, but the job itself is pretty terrible. Lack of work at times, not really growing my skills, and there is little to no advancement opportunity. So I have a degree in IT. I want to continue to work in the IT field, but currently there is nothing open in my area that fits my skillset. So I'm looking for a new job but I can't seem to find anything in IT. There are plenty of jobs outside of the IT field that I feel I would be qualified for. My question becomes, is it bad for me to work in a job that is not IT for a time until something in IT opens up? Will it look bad on my resume? Will potential future employers think, because I quit an IT job to work in, let's say Sales or something not IT, that maybe I couldn't handle my previous IT job? 

Take it at face value, since it seems to be the first and only occurrence. Now your supervisor knows you are interested in more responsibility, so be prepared to be given it. You may, or may not, like what you get. I would also plan this as a topic of discussion at your next regularly scheduled personal/personnel/annual review/meeting with your supervisor. Keep it in his mind and he should make it a higher priority for you. The only time I would take offense, would be if it happens again, with the same management chain in place and basically exactly the same circumstances. Please trust your manager that he knows more about the other teams than you and made what he considered the best choice for a valid reason. The next opportunity may have the same outcome - someone else may be a better fit for some reason. It would bother me only if it was essentially the same as before. 

The fact that there were no technical questions asked, that would pertain to how you would do this job, were you to be given it, means this was most likely just an introductory interview. An interview to ask those generalized questions like "where do you see yourself in 5 years", or "name a time where you were in charge and had to make a difficult decision". In this instance, the position of the interviewer is irrelevant. Since she was just conducting the introductory interview, there was simply no reason to question her position with the company. It may not have been meant as an insult or meant to offend, but that's probably how it came off, especially after she said "I will send your application to the hiring manager", it's clear she wasn't the one making the hiring decision, she was just getting those common questions out of the way. In my experience, the phone interview is generally just an "introductory" interview, kind of see how you may fit into the workplace, a few generalized questions that they ask to get them out of the way so the next interview can focus solely on the technical side. Next time, just worry about answering the questions(and no it doesn't mean you can't ASK questions), and let them decide who is going to interview you. If they're interviewing you with unqualified people, maybe that's not a company you want to work for anyway.
