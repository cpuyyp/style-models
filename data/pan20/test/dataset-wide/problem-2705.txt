This makes more sense, although in some (or even many) cases I think this is what is done. That is, there is also a grey area about the definition of life when someone seems to be in a coma, or brain dead, etc., and this does determine transplant decisions. Also, many medical decisions and attitudes are even formed based on how old a healthy person is, and the quality of their remaining expected lifetime, or the chances of them surviving a procedure, and how long and how well they are statistically expected to live after a procedure. These don't define the patient as "not life", but they do affect how much we invest in them, and whether we "let them die" in favor of others, or even just in favor of the time and resources and money of the medical industry. 

In the analytic tradition, philosophical arguments consist of clearly stated premises and logically sound conclusions. Some (already noted) attempts to locate in Rand's work such specific premises and conclusions show that her positions on several important points (e.g. causation and free will) are self-contradictory and inconsistent. This makes her conclusions irrelevant to the philosophical discourse in which she appears to have been attempting to participate. So in this way, the answer to your above question is a resounding "YES!"; a lack of argumentation entails a lack of rigor in argumentation. Upon reflection, I realize that one could respond here by saying that Rand was engaged in a more Continental approach to philosophy. Consider her tendency to employ fiction to "make her point" – a strategy (as previously mentioned in another answer) employed by Sartre and Camus, among other Continentals. Reading her this way, Rand's work could be seen as having a place within some larger historical philosophical discourse. However, her well-documented ideological struggle against Marxism undermines her own argument again here; the Marxist dialectic underpins the Continental approach to philosophy. If we are to take Rand's conclusions seriously, which is to say that if we take her particular anti-Marxism to be the point she is making, then she is using the Marxist dialectic to completely disavow Marxism, thus ending the dialectic. There are two problems with this. First, her work would be little more than her bid to be the "the champion of all philosophical discourse", and second, there are still WAY too many questions left unanswered for us to stop doing philosophy. So frankly, she has written nothing particularly philosophically interesting or compelling. 

My answer would clearly be: no. Hijacking is a loaded word. You don't explain how this argument from adverse consequences would work, but I assume you are suggesting that the pro choice movement is suggesting that a foetus is not inviolate life because unwanted pregnancies have bad effects on women's lives? I don't think I've ever heard anyone argue that, so no. And I don't agree with your premise that the "only real issue on the table" is "life", so no. I think the comment that goldilocks made about this "begging the question" is accurate: you seem to have unquestioned premises that a fetus is "inviolate life", and that that trumps a woman's choice about whether to bear the child or not. All your conclusions on the question of abortion rights seem to just be direct consequences of assuming those premises to be true. If we instead start with a premise that, just to pick another arbitrary example, that the ancient Roman attitude that a child isn't a person yet until a year after birth is instead our premise, then we'd have very different "real issues" and very different conclusions. Postscript: To respond to your comment by explain why I think you're "begging the question" here. I don't mean this ad hominem, or to suggest you're intentionally doing this. Begging the question is where your conclusion is essentially the same as the premise you start with. The questions you stated were: 

Regarding the truth of physicalism WRT the existence of Pzombies, in order to reach the conclusion that "physicalism is false" from the premises given, then it must be part of the definition of "physicalism" that all mental states are identical with and reducible to physical states. It's this necessary property implicit in the definition of the term that would make physicalism false (if you buy such arguments) because the Pzombie counts as a conceivably possible counterexample to the universal claims of the physicalist. However, if one offered a more nuanced definition for physicalism, something like "To have mental state X is to be in physical state Y" such that "physical state Y" is functionally defined, then non-physicalist arguments for and from Pzombies become significantly more difficult to maintain. One philosopher who argues for at least the possible existence of Pzombies is (famously) Chalmers. 

The golden rule in itself is fine, but it is naive to follow a rule which has no instructions for successful practical application. This, I think, is what is likely referred to when the golden rule is called childish. "Do onto others, as you would have them do onto you." gives no thought to the practical applications, specifically where two people who have differing ideals come together. The Golden Rule quite often completely fails when one tries to use it across cultural boundaries. Or even in the same culture many people have different views on many things. If the way you would want to be treated is seen as offensive to another person, what then do you do? The answer requires more thought than simply following the single statement in the golden rule. Perhaps an amendment to the golden rule should be as follows "Do onto others, as you would have them do onto you if you were in their place". The difficulty of practical application is still present, but at least it is noted that you should consider that not everything you like is liked by others. 

I agree that these are all problems where you have multiple people with different life prospects and chances of survival and resources to consider. However in this case I don't follow what you are saying about the fetus. It does seem to me that it would be relevant how important you considered the fetus' status to be. 

For this to be well-defined, one would need to define "life" and say what "rules" one means, as well as what stages of "foetus". 

while your premises are essentially statements of fact about the same issue, not asking whether life is inviolate or not, or whether different stages of fetus are life or not, or whether life's inviolate-ness trumps a woman's choice, or not. In the last line of your final question, this premise/conclusion is directly stated: "the only real issue on the table: life". You did write in your third paragraph "if a foetus doesn't yet count as life, then no such rules apply." but you don't ever address that issue after that. You also don't address the other non-premise questions I mentioned in the above paragraph. So sure, if your premise is right that killing fetuses is always wrong and "the only real issue on the table", then you are right... that that is your premise. 

I'm going to try not to step on any toes here. No matter how you slice it, the content of your belief is almost undoubtedly not the "resulting distribution" of a "credence-distribution over the two hypotheses." It's easy to see why it can't be: when someone asks you if you believe A or B, your answer will never be "the resulting distribution of a credence-distribution over the two hypotheses." That may describe how you came to hold the belief you hold, but that process is not the content of that belief. 

This highlights another frustration some academic philosophers might have regarding Ayn Rand. She relies on absolute self-certainty where she should be relying on well-reasoned arguments. One problem here is doing this often resembles well-thought-out, consistent philosophy, but in terms of actual philosophy, it amounts to nothing more than polemics and screeds. From her writings, all that can be logically deduced are her opinions, yet I have no doubt that Rand dislikes Marxism, nor do I doubt her love of Capitalism. Another problem is that assuming the certainty of your conclusions is simply poorly-executed philosophy – every philosopher must be willing to accept that they could be wrong about their conclusions, or else they are not doing philosophy. Again, her work is thus philosophically uninteresting. But if your thoughts are provoked by her writing, that's a good thing. I recommend taking some time to sketch out her arguments and see for yourself if her conclusions actually follow from her premises. 

One person's freedom and liberty ends abruptly where that of another person's begins. Historically we have had to give up some measure of freedom in order to limit others from the ability of abusing their freedom to cause harm. That has long been the argument. I believe that in this particular instance the words equality and justice were added simply to assist in making a point and to gather the required letters to spell security. 

Choosing a course of action without a complete knowledge of all possible evidence is not a fallacy, it is a common fact of life. If person A fired person B because of perceived ethical misconduct then it is possibly a well thought out decision on the part of person A because they do not want to risk the negative impact of person B's conduct. It is simply a risk assessment, and logically valid at that.
