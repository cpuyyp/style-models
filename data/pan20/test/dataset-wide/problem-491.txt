I have no personal knowledge but have heard of the Courage Center. It is an organization that helps people with varied challenges with rehab and fitness issues. A German company called Stricker makes a bicycle type attachment that connect to a standard wheel chair, unfortunately their website doesn't translate all of it into english. 

Nothing is theft proof for a determined thief. The best you can do is make more difficult to steal than a similar item close to yours. If your rack is hitch mounted a small cable looped through the chain eyelet or a hitch pin lock should be sufficient. A trunk mounted rack can be secured in a similar method. Attach a length of cable to a block of wood. String the cable through the rack and place the block of wood in the trunk. The rack cant be removed unless the trunk is opened. You could also remove the rack and store it in the trunk while you are riding. 

I would go back to the shop where you purchased the bike and ask them to let you test ride a similar bike under similar conditions.This will eliminate the They all do that excuse.Even the factory makes mistakes in the assembly or manufacturing process or something may have been damaged in shipping. 

As all the comments have stated most appear to be brand/ model specific. Since it is an older frame it is possible that it didn't have them. Some older frames snaked the entire cable housing thru the frame. The stop was on the component, (brake, derailleur or frame mounted cable stop). If you search for custom bike frames builders you may find some local sources. If you don't have your heart set on internal cables, you can use bolt on frame mounted stops. You will need to measure the frame tube diameter and figure out if you need single, double or triple stops. 

I would suggest a quality older Chrome-moly steel framed rigid fork mountain bike. The older Bridgestone (MB-2,3,4,or 5), Trek 820 or 850 or Specialized RockHopper. The older mountain bikes were built for what was then considered abusive conditions. They are more than strong enough for bike paths or grassy trails. Don't even consider taking them on any kind of technical terrain. If you mount street slicks or mild knobbie they can be quite streetable. The cranks tended to be in the 48t-36t-26t range. This gearing lends itself to touring and hilly road riding. 

I had a similar issue and found that the inside diameter was an odd size. One millimeter is a mile as far as seatpost sizes are concerned. Another issue is that on some frames (in my case a Schwinn) the seat post won't insert past the top tube. This leaves very little post inserted. I settled on a Ritchey WCS mast topper. It will allow for approx. 40mm of height adjustment by using spacers. It is an alloy model that weighs about 17 grams more than the carbon at about 1/3 the cost. 

No.The viscosity is high (too thick)to penatrate between the chain side plates all it will do is cause dirt and grit to stick to the chain and accelerate wear. 

Is it possible that part of the folding mechanism is not aligned well resulting in frame flex under the heavier loads of the highest gears 

I measured several sets that I have and got the following results. These were used with Shimano, Tektro, Avid and one with "no name" brakes. This not to say that some other brands don't have a unique size. The male threads that go into the frame were either M6 by 15mm long or M8 by 10mm long. The shaft or studs (part labeled as C) were all just under 8mm, 7.93, 7.90, 7.89 etc. The threaded female hole were all M6. The M8 by 10mm posts all came off of rear brake mounts. The use of the larger diameter and shorter length may be due to the smaller diameter of the seat stay tubing. 

I have built a few bikes for less than already built cost. It takes a lot of time and research to do it. If you add the cost of the personal time, it has to be more a labor of love than a financial gain. It took over a year and hours of looking on line, E Bay, Craigs List and retailers for the best deals on individual components and buying only when I thought the price was the best I could get. What I finished with was about half the cost of the bike assembled. I also gained the skills needed to repair almost anything on the bike and an understanding of how everything works. The reason for the up charges on components are as stated by others, volume pricing and the five or six hands that touch the part before it makes it to the bike shop. Every layer of the supply chain makes a profit and the price goes up per unit. 

Try to post some photos of the adjuster along with the brand and model of the shifters.If you have an adjuster at the deraileur end of the cable it is possible there is no adjuster at the shifter end.The piece at the end of the cable may just position the cable in the shifter.There is also an adjuster that has small steps or knotches molded in to the shortened barrel. With each 1/4 turn it slides out the cable housing a small amount,but after a complete turn it returns to the original position.It appears to work as a fine adjustment similar to the trim control on more expensive shifters 

Providing that is of the same type and size it will interchange. As an example hollow-tech II 10 speed BB30 English will interchange Dura-Ace, Ultegra, 105 will all fit. Ceramic bearings are sold as smoother hence less resistance, will you notice the difference? It is hard to say, but probable not except in your wallet. 

It has been done,is being done and is wildly accepted by the few who feel the need for and have the wallet for, a two wheel drive bicycle. A google search for two wheel drive bicycle will yield enough hits to keep you busy for a few hours. Every one I have seen is flexible shaft drive. The shaft is driven by a gear mounted where the rear disc would be and a similar arrangement on the front. A flexible drive shaft connects the two gears. Maybe someday it will be the norm but for now it is more of a curiosity, hey people thought 29ers were a fad. 

There are Powder-Coating kits that are made for home use. They are available in the U.S. from Sears-Craftsman, The Eastwood Company and others. They range in price from under $200 to as much as you want to spend. The process involves using the supplied gun to apply a colored dry powder to the part. The part is then baked in a household oven. The baking cures the powder to something similar in appearance to a ceramic glaze. It is a very durable finish. It does create some issues though. It cannot be touched up if damaged. The coating is thicker than paint. Threaded holes and close tolerence mating surfaces must be protected during the process. Of course you could only color components that can have all their plastic parts removed. 

I believe a Shimano SL-RS41-7 is compatible. I have one in my spare parts box and they look identical. A quick google search shows lots of sources. Most E Bay listings are under $20 for the set. 

You are correct that 2x8 refers to 8 speed cassette or freewheel and a crank with 2 speeds. The one that can be confusing is 18speed which can be an older 3x6 or a more modern 2x9. The other concerns is mountain or road drivetrain and Shimano, Sram or Campagnolo compatible. You can search this site for compatibility questions that may match your specific circumstances. 

My guess is that by the time the first bottom bracket (crank axle) was replaced the left side pedal arm was also damaged. When you installed the damaged crank arm to the new axle it worked for awhile. You are now at the point that you have a worn arm and a worn crank axle. Replacement of just one of the components will result the premature failure of the other. You need a new bottom bracket and crankset. As this is an expensive repair it may be worth looking for a used assembly that is in good shape. The crank arm bolt should be tightened to about 30-35 ftlbs of torque. This takes quite a bit of effort with the average 6 inch long allen wrench. 

It is not uncommon for new bike or older bikes with new cable to require a retune after a few rides. The cause is cable stretch. With use the cable stretches slightly. If you purchased your bike from a local shop it likely included a free adjustment and fastener check after 30 days of use. You can also search for tutorials on line dealing with derailleur adjustments. Park Tools' and Sheldon Browns' sites are the favorite of many cyclists. 

Most anchor points in aluminum frames are not an actual tapped holes in the frame. It is a threaded inset that attaches to the frame similar to the way a pop rivet works. On older frames they were sometimes referred to as braze-ons. If you search for Nutsert or rivet nut they may be available at your local home center. While the individual inserts are not expensive the insertion tool can be close to $80. The inserts can also be troublesome to remove. Attempting to drill them out usually results in the insert spinning in the mounting hole. A local custom frame builder may be able to help you as they likely have the tool to install bottle cage mounts and such. 

I would clean the area with soap and water. you can cover any deep paint chips with clear nail polish. Gaffers tape which I assume is similar to duct tape will not provide adequate protection. It degrades when exposed to sunlight and the residue left after it is removed is tough to remove. There are several companies making frame protection films. "Lizard Skins" is one I am familiar with. It is a thick plastic adhesive backed film. The film comes in precut shapes to mount in specific areas. When the film gets to the point it needs replacement it peels off. Any glue residue comes off with alcohol. 

I know that the Jagwire brand mountain cable sets come with a small diameter tube that cover all the exposed cables. I used the extra pieces on my old Giant. It did seem to make the cable movement smoother although it is subjective. I have never seen it available in single lengths. You could check your LBS to see if they have any short pieces or look in a local hardware/ home center for small diameter tubing. 

From the information available your bike uses a 1-1/8" quill style adjustable stem. The only other pertinent variable is handlebar diameter. While you most likely have 25.4mm (1 inch) bars you could have 31.8mm bars. Locating replacement bolts will likely be difficult as the pinch bolts of pivoting stems are typically brand specific in terms of length of the shoulder and diameter of the head. 

What information is available on these models make it appears to be an lower cost Big Box Store quality bike. It has non descript components. These bikes typically have a very simple suspension. The shocks consist of a spring and plastic sleeves that act as bushings. The dampening rate can be adjusted by removing the plastic caps on the fork crown and inserting a long 5mm allen wrench. Tightening the screws preloads the springs and makes it stiffer. There is no rebound adjustment. Parts to rebuild these are usually not available. You can (with care) disassemble them to clean and lube the plastic sleeves. If this doesn't improve anything, a new fork will likely cost more than replacement cost of the whole bike. These types of bikes can be used as short term commuters, they won't last long if used for aggressive off road riding. 

I have used hemmroid cream on "hot spots"due to chaffing on my feet but not more sensitive areas.Apparently it shrinks the membranes that cause blisters to form and thickens the skin so it is less likely to open. 

It is possible that the freehub has become loose from the hub. Remove the axle and bearings from the hub. Insert a the correct size allen wrench (I believe a10mm) into the non drive side. Tighten the retaining nut. If hub continues to spin you may need to use two wrenches. One inserted in the free hub and one to tighten the retaining nut. 

There are several differences between a CX bike and a roadbike. Tire clearance, your current frame may not have enough clearance between the rear stays to allow a larger tire with knobbies. Most CX frames use either cantilever or disc brakes. Cyclocross routes can be muddy. The mud tends to collect at the crown of the fork if a road style brake is used. Because the terrain of a cyclocross course can be varied and unpaved the gearing lends itself somewhere between a traditional mountain-bike crankset (42-32-22) and a traditional road compact- double (50-34), cyclocross is typically (46-36). The frame is generally a little more robust to deal with the uneven terrain. The frame design tends to be an open triangle to facilitate carrying on the shoulder to clear larger obstacles. So in essence you could use a road bike. but there is the risk of damage, some of which could be mediated by dismounting and shouldering the bike.
