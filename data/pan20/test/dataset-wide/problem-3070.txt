Mounted archers are much older; the Romans faced them when they fought the Partians. And Huns and other nomadic people also used this kind of military unit. The specificity of mediaeval cavalry was the use of brute force and lances, to turn knight-and-horse into an almost unstoppable impact weapon, that sought direct combact instead of diverting from it. 

In most of Brazil, Afroamerican religion is Candomblé, which is rooted in Yoruba traditional religion, with influences of Angola-Congo traditions. The main exception is the Northeastern state of Maranhão, were Daomeyan (Ewe) tradition (Vodum) dominates. Now, Maranhão was settled by the French, before being conquered by the Portuguese (São Luís is, as it is said, "the only Brazilian capital city that wasn't founded by the Portuguese"). And if I look for other places where Vodum predominated over Candomblé, I find Haiti (Voudu) and Louisiana (Voodoo). In the rest of the Americas, either Afroamerican religions were completely eradicated, or they are predominantly influenced by Yoruba tradition (except, I think, for Guyana, where Fanti-Ashanti tradition is the main influence). But both Louisiana and Haiti were French colonies, like Maranhão originally was. So my questions are, is this merely a coincidence, or is it somehow related? Would it have to do with different European metropoles controlling different regions in coastal West Africa, or different slave trade routes? Are there studies, books, papers, that deal with this issue? Or have the sources that could shed some light upon this destroyed, leaving the question unanswerable? 

I think this is a question for history, even though it is also a question for anthropology (and that Rome was anything but post-agricultural). The Romans certainly practiced human sacrifices in older times. The practice was forbidden by a Senate decree in 97 BC, and Romans later came to believe that it was uncivilised behaviour. They seemed to believe that the Carthaginians (and/or Phoenicians in general) not only sacrificed human beings, but even sacrificed children of their own, which they regarded as doubly repugnant. Whether the Phoenicians actually did that (and in which circumstance or up to when) is debatable (the Romans leveled the same accusation against Christians, Gauls, and Jews, which seems to point to them not being above making false accusations of that nature). But also the Hebrews quite certainly practiced human sacrifices in early times, albeit not at the time the Romans were concerned with them. The Biblic narrative of God demanding Abraham to sacrifice his son, and recanting at the last moment is probably symbolic of the abandonment of this practice. So the issue would rather be "why were the Mayans and Aztecs still making human sacrifices in 1500, while 'old world' civilisations had abandoned such practices (more than) a millenium earlier"? One probable explanation is that Mexican/Central American civilisations were more recent than those in the "old world"; given enough time, they would probably have evolved in a similar direction. But the scale of human sacrifices in pre-Columbian Mexico/Guatemala was probably much bigger than in the old world, and Peruvian civilisations, albeit similarly recent, don't seem to have had anything as important or widespread, if at all. So it is possible that another factor was at play, probably rooted in the hostile relations between the Aztecs and their neighbours, and linked to the extensive ritualisation of warlike activity between them. 

He discusses the kidnappings of those princesses, in the context of the reasons the Persians gave for their enmity towards the Greek. Such discussion takes the first five paragraphs (something like 3%) of Book I (the whole work consists of nine books); but it is not really an account of the Trojan War. 

The Soviet population in 1941 was 196,716,000. In 1946, it was 170,548,000.[1] That's a difference of 26,168,000 people. According to a study published by the Russian Academy of Science[2], there were 12,300,000 births and 11,900,000 natural deaths during war, so the populational decrease must be entirely attributed to war deaths. Considering 400,000 births in excess of natural deaths, the war deaths must have been around 26,600,000, which is the number accepted by the Russian government. Of these casualties, 8,700,000 were military casualties[3]. The upper limit of the female/male proportion, so, would be the case that all 26,600,000 casualties were masculine. In such a case, the proportion would be, if we accept a prewar proportion of 1.05/1, given by the following: 

The media and the academy, and, dare I say, the whole part of the world that has not yet gone insane. 

So, for any group of 20 adults, 1 would be smoking at any given time. But this is probably an undercalculation: people smoked more in certain situations than in others. Early in the morning, late in the evening, and mealtimes were circumstances of less consumption, and the middle of mornings and afternoons quite probably concentrated most smoking. Plus, as already discussed, men did smoke significantly more than women, and men are overrepresented in movies in general (don't know specifically if in Mad Men this is true, though, considering the title, it probably is). 

I do not think it is accurate to say that guerilla techniques weren't used in the Civil War. What did Stonewall Jackson do in the Shenandoah Valley? But guerilla tactics are limited. First, they are adequate in defensive struggle, conducted within your own territory, where you count with superior knowledge of the terrain, and the loyalty of the local population. Second, they are useful to wear down the enemy, to force them to disperse and waste material, to strech their communications, to demoralise their troops. But you cannot storm their capital with guerilla tactics; you have to win a conventional battle for that end (or provoke a rebellion within it; but that rebellion, I promise, will be "bloody"). Guerilla is consequently the weapon of the weak. The North had no reason to fight this way; it was overwhelmingly stronger, and consequently would tend to force decisive conventional battles to break the South as quickly as possible. Geography conspired against this, with so many rivers standing between their troops and their objective in Richmond. So the South would be interested in guerilla. But they could not use it in offensive war, and even in defense, they needed to block the direct advances of the Union armies, to which end they needed conventional troops. They were, after all, organised as a conventional State, with a capital city, established markets, regular army, hierarchic command, etc. They could not afford a theory of abandoning their political and economic centers and fight "from the void" as a Maoist guerilla. And the system they were defending divided their population between a higher stratum that would have the interest in fighting, but not the disposition to wear rags and crawl in the mud, and a lower stratum that would have the disposition, but no interest in fighting for the cause (rather, would be interested in supporting the enemy). So, in short, guerilla was used when it seemed useful and viable. It didn't seem useful and viable too often, due to limitations imposed by the nature of the conflict, and by the nature of each side in the war. 

Well, North Korea officially calls itself Democratic Popular Republic of Korea, so either names aren't of that much importance, or both main parties in the United States are just fronts for Juche "philosophy". 

Recently I had the displeasure of discussing with someone who argued that professional soldier and amateur historian John Glubb "demonstrated" that women in public offices entail the decadence of societies. I searched for the book, or rather pamphlet ("The Fate of Empires"), and, needless to say, the author can't demonstrate anything similar (though I don't doubt he effectively believed something like that). But I got curious - what importance, if any, does academic history in Anglo-Saxon countries attribute to John Glubb as a historian (I know he is not irrelevant as a military professional)? Does anyone care? Is he cited, discussed, refuted? If so, by whom? 

None. It was a militaristic, interventionist, elitist, racist, antisemitic, homophobic, misogynistic, authoritarian regime, hell bent from its starts on suppressing the German left, which they did with brutal efficiency. 

In sum, the graph is a mere impressionistic illustration of a thesis that is at best simplistic. There is not only no actual measurement of anything (as the article recognises), but it doesn't show any real understanding of the dynamics of "progress" during the enormous period it attempts to illustrate. 

Most agricultural production was provided by individual peasant families. Those would have to share their product with landlords, through different mechanisms, namely labour rents (the peasants' access to their land parcels implied the obligation to work in the lord's fields for a given number of days per week) and sharecropping (the peasants' acces to their land parcels implied the payment of a rent in the form of a part of their harvests to the landlord). These peasants were not slaves (ie, they could not be sold or rented or otherwise treated as property), but they were often serfs, ie, they were bound to land, which they could not leave without express permission of their lords (and, conversely, from which they could not be legally expelled at the lord's whim). There was a marked social division between rural and urban sectors of society. While there were plenty of rural or itinerant artisans, cities concentrated most of the crafts, and the production there was organised in a remarkably different way. Basically, the common artisan was either a journeyman or an apprentice; both earned wages. Their masters were guild members, and typically were artisans themselves; the guild was an organisation that regulated most of the production and commercial practices, even fixing prices and wages. In theory, apprenticeship was a way for the young artisan to become a master himself; in practice, masters could keep apprentices in such a condition for a very long time, thus maintaing them in dependence. Both in countryside and city, but more conspicously in the former, there was a characteristic fusion of ownership and political functions. Landlords were typically not only owners of their land, but also it's governors and judges. The landlords, as a class, were organised in a hierarchic way. Typically, land ownership was a concession from above; a landlord's ownership was inseparable from his relation to a higher landlord (thence a hierarchy of barons, viscounts, counts, dukes, kings, towering above the lower layer of untitled lords), and such relation was a one of political loyalty, implying military duties (mainly meaning the obligation to provide armed men at the overlord's request). That relation between property and poltical-military loyalty constitutes the fief - an extent of land owned conditionally to a fealty tie (and, of course, "fief" is etymologically related to "feudalism"). Estates were in principle indivisible, leading to the huge importance of primogeniture, and to a permanent problem of what to do with further children. This favoured re-centralising tendencies within the system, as higher lords could place those landless noblemen at their service. The State was paired by the characteristic intitution of Church, which remained basically independent from the hierarchical nobility, provided another outlet for "second sons", a upward social mobility way to integrate exceptional commoners into the ruling classes, and generally worked as a "check and balance" structure to the power of the nobility.
