If we swap the top pulley and the carabiner, we actually get a better MA of about 4.92:1 with the same gear (but we obviously lose the progress capturing). 

That would again mean the new arrow is about 7% faster than the old one. By the numbers you could guess that the approximation is about 3% off the "exact" value, as predicted. Bottom line Again looking at the graph above, we can conclude that if the weights are close enough, I suggest the rule of thumb the relative difference in velocity is going to be about half the relative difference in mass. What do I mean by that: If you have a weight difference of 10% (as long as the weights are close enough, it does not matter which one you consider as 100%) then the difference in velocity is going to be about 5%. Again checking with the "exact" formula (considering ) 

Trailers can be literally thrown around by a tornado, even high straight winds can be a concern, under it is not a safe place. Usually the idea is to know when they come and move out well before they hit: you, family, pets... these are the important things, the rest is replaceable so don't waste time in trying to save objects. Keeping a bag ready with whats necessary for you+pets in an emergency (a "bug out bag") so that you can just "grab and go" can be a good idea. That bag would also be the place where you would normally store things like personal documents and important medications, so even if you use something everyday you know its either in your hand or in there. Many RV guys consider a weather radio an essential item (in addition to that there are all the various websites and mobile apps that can help in keeping an eye on weather conditions at all times, and I'm talking about things in-depth like NOAA). In risky areas where travel trailers are common there might be some sort of community shelters (or buildings that offer shelter to the community, heard of schools doing that for example), also look for any nearby suitable buildings where find refuge in the area (like parking garages) etc. The responsible for any organized area for trailers should be able to give you the right informations on what are your options, otherwise you could try asking the local police or fire dept. Camping I heard plenty of people that say to keep an eye on the landscape that surrounds you, to use a ditch or similar. Id say that it cant hurt to be aware of the possibility but consider it a last resort thing. 

Now after I got some answers I'd like to post my own observations: The most 'efficient' method I found so far with out using foot ascenders is using two conventional ascenders/(or prussiks/tibloc etc) with each a footloop. (And both obviously also connected to your harness for safety.) That way you can use your leggs to push yourself up. But it still can be relatively tiring compare to using foot ascenders as you have balance your body such that you keep the feet directly under your body. So I think the crucial thing is keeping the rope close to your body. Comparision to rope access techs/ arborists Arborists who are using foot ascenders do this by having their friction device permanently on the rope. The special thing about their devices is that they can be used for ascending or decending on a tensioned rope, unlike the grigri/tubers/other belaying devices in climbing. Here images of foot ascenders and a typical "rope wrench system": Source Source You can also observe this idea in rope access. Rope access technicians do have full body harnesses that quite often a built in chest ascender, that is that way kept close to the body. 

Its something that happens in every sport. Generally target shooting the mantra is: bad day, drop everything for awhile, go get a beer, chitchat, help others in the club or simply call it the day. The worst thing one can do is fussing on a bad shot, and after that it becomes fussing about fussing on the bad shot and it never ends. You can train yourself in many ways, meditation etc, and at the end clearing your mind is an exercise you would have to do whenever something is required from you, that is a deadline, a job interview, school tests etc. When it comes to tournaments though, you don't have the luxury of dropping the whole thing and you must enter "the zone" from the beginning. Eventually after a certain number of tournaments you will get the whole situation as an habit but you need to recognize the signs of things going the wrong direction and correct them before they precipitate into a point of no return state of mind. If you can try Kyudo, the shooting there is really structured and the mental aspect of it is taken care of as part of the training as much as the technique as its considered part of it (shooting technique is much different but movements aside the philosophy behind it is transferable). What can happen messing up the concentration is that you have a lack of focus, you worry about your equipment, feel uneasy about the competition and are agitated in a general sense, at the opposite there is such a thing as being too focused, the score becomes the all important thing, you almost want to drive the arrow to the target by pure mind power, your shooting will suffer because to mental tension follows body tension, your movement will be less fluid and your technique less clean, your result poor. Then there are the others, your team, your club, your buddies, a bunch of strangers, people taking videos of the shot maybe and if you screw up there will be forever a record of it. Yet, you probably dont practice alone, your friends, team, club are always around you, videos should exist because they are a good way to review the shots. Keep your equipment always top notch, be anal about it, even if they will be Sunday shots for the rest of your life your equipment should always be perfect and ready, all in a proper carrying bag, in order, no chance to forget at home or misplace anything ever. At competition time you wont have to worry about it, you wont have to fuss around your gear and that will keep you less agitated. When you practice often you are in a certain state of mind, just peaceful and having fun, you can recognize the feeling and bring your mind on that, every time it happens during practice, and tie that condition to certain things to act as trigger, it can be some sequence of things you do to prepare the bow, something in your equipment, a smell... pick something constant that you wont have to prepare and fuss about before a competition, that will simply be always there and close to you (don't pick the target as those change from place to place and time). In competition you will use that trigger to ground yourself. You also might find helpful to find a calm corner to take position and draw your bow a few times without arrow (don't dry fire it obviously), if you do that do it at every practice session also. Work out a simple routine and stick with that, practice or competition, same routine... routine is good, its muscle memory for your mind. Breathing: that is important, your movements, since you move into position to the follow-trough, and your breathing must be coordinated with eachother, keep a slow steady rhythm, deep breaths, breathe with your belly and fill up all your lungs (in our daily life we tend to breathe faster and shallower breaths, it becomes an habit and breathing rhythm is linked to our fight/flight reflex) keep the pace the competition calls for but maintain the coordination and the depth. Deep rhythmical breathing is also a good technique to use while getting grounded (do it as an habit during practice also so its part of your routine). Some will simplify the issue just saying to hold your breath here etc but there is a significant reflex system that is worth leveraging. If ultimately you consider the reasons that brought you to sign up for the tournament you might find things to work on: was it for fun? buddies pushed you to it? was it to show off? bragging rights? prize? Remember that in a competition you can only do your best, at that point what is there is there, the drive to improve yourself is only for practice. There should be more pressure on yourself during practice because you should try to get better and better results session after session. But it ends there, you don't get better than what you are in a tournament, the competition is just for doing what you do, it just happens that people attach points to things but really, how does it change your life? Its not a million dollars prize isn't it... just do your thing. That others will be looking and judging your shooting its a fact, but others look at you and judge you everyday of your life and its not that big of a deal, for sure you did plenty of things way more important than shooting at a target while people judged you and didn't even think about it for a moment. Once the time comes its you and you alone taking the shot, noone else has any importance when it comes to that arrow (unless they are standing in the way ;) ). Beside all the mental practice that should go on side by side your technique practice there are also little workarounds that are different from person to person, you will have to work them out on your own. If you are in a team you can remove the tournament atmosphere just turning it into a bit of a game with eachother: best score pays dinner (or beer, depending on finances)... dont do worst score or you just swapped one competition for another. That way its your game that you are playing and the competition just happens to fall around it. Back in the day one of my buddies used absurd hats while shooting, his cure for being in the centre of the attention was just to attract more attention on something that wasn't his arrow. At the end of the day shooting is an art, its like painting on the target, and there is a certain harmony in all the little things that come together in the perfect shot, once you see it its instinct to tune into it. 

Using the rule of thumb: In this case and are not really that close, so this result might be a bit off compared to the other one: With the above values we have: 

As you can see my rule of thumb is less than 10% off the "exact" formula if the new arrow is at least half as heavy and at most twice as heavy as the old one. But if you consider arrows with a weight difference of a factor two, then the initial assumption is probably get us a way bigger error. Example In your example we have 

Yes you can. Well... sort of. You can open the bag and use the magnesium powder (its a mixture really) inside as fire starter (think the classic old photography flash kind of effect but much much less violent and spectacular as that mixture would be a slow burning one) or you can light the hydrogen mixed with steam that comes off the bag when the reaction starts, although not all kinds are exactly the same in the kind of gas mixture given off. (dont heat up your MRE right beside the campfire ;) ) In itself the heat given off by reaction of one bag is not hot enough to light a fire and cant ignite the hydrogen produced (the hottest one will be a bit above 100C) 

I do not know any rule of thumbs but I do have some knowledge in physics and math, so lets see what we can do with that=) Let's assume the energy that is put into an arrow is independent of the weight of the arrow. If we would want to model this too, it would be highly dependent of construction of the bow, and not useful for any rule of thumb. And as long as the weight of the two arrows we want to consider is sufficiently similar, this assumption will still provide good enough results. Let's call the mass of the first arrow and the mass of the second one , similarly denotes the velocity of the first arrow, the velocity of the second one. As the kinetic energy stays constant we have the equation: 

For marine covers there are some cleaning products made on purpose that you could use on the awning too. The DIY route consists in solutions of bleach+water or ammonia+water that tend to be nasty to deal with and dispose of (cant just let them on the ground), they do work. Peroxide is another solution, safer but a bit less effective. Beware that they can weaken the stitching. TSP also works. The safest, but it involves some scrubbing is baking soda, scrub with a soft brush and then go over with vinegar. In all cases rinse really well. You can go to one of those self service carwashes (taking the awning off the RV the carwash bay should be big enough to let you open it fully) and wash it there, the water has good pressure and does a good job. Careful about the water pressure if you use a power washer, not all the fabrics can take it, but if it can be used it helps a lot. Sun is also one of your best friend against mold and being able to take the awning off the RV allows you to keep it in the sun as much as possible even if you dont use the RV. Sometimes though the smell is absorbed into the awning and never fully comes out. Do not use car products, they can have some additives that will actually help the mold. Remember that if you clean the awning you need to also clean completely its housing where it gets rolled in. 

Even this approximation of the coefficient is quite nonlinear so it is not possible to make a statement x grains equal y fps. In the following graph you can see the relationship between the ratio of the two velocities and the ratio of the masses. 

That means the (muzzle-) speed of the new arrow will be about 7% greater than the one of the old arrow. Using the "correct" formula In this case we get: 

Always inspect the seal, the closing ring and the barrel lip when buying used barrels, some are pristine and other have been somewhat abused. In certain cases the seal might look good but, from factory or if a bit old, doesn't apply enough pressure on the barrel lip or the metal ring wedge shape is a bit too open (the ring squashes lid and barrel together pushing the seal against the barrel lip). However, for how much you want to pick the best of the bunch, even in barrels with some minor damage you shouldn't have leaks. We had our barrels fully submerged to keep contents cool (we submerged on purpose, normally they float), had them in the water after capsizing and a couple times they ran down rapids and took a good beating but never saw any leaks. And in our barrels the seal is not a solid ring, it shows a joint that is not separated but not glued either so there could be a potential water entry, yet they stayed dry. I even use them to keep electronics safe. If you have more than one barrel try switching the closing rings, if the ring is the problem that's one way to find out. You could also remove the seal to add another rubber ring underneath, any smooth rubber will do as the seal will still go on top of that, avoid caulking if there's the possibility you don't spread it evenly resulting in a bad seal. This will put more pressure against the barrel lip and that's easier than messing around with the metal ring. If you prefer you can use some dry bags inside the barrels, its a bit redundant but the leaky barrel outside might still serve as protection from rocks and puncture. 

The strength is dependent mainly on the angle between the two ropes form, on which the hammock is hung, and the weight you want the hammock to support. For a traditional hammock the angles of the ropes (measured to the horizontal) are about (just an estimate). Lets assume we want to design the system for a person weighing . Then we can derive a formula for the force ( acting on the ropes using trigonometry:
