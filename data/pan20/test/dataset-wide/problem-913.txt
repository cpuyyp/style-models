In computer work, there's a type of system called a sandbox. It's a model, a toy, a place to try things that could cripple or destroy a working system. You create a sandbox to let a student make mistakes or conduct experiments. A sandbox isn't connected to other systems and can be reset any number of times. In this interview Le Guin uses the same general idea to describe science fiction. You can create a world to any specification and try out new ideas. If the world is destroyed, well, it was only make-believe, no harm done. That's a common strategy in SF: extrapolate a current trend to an absurd degree to show the danger. Another strategy is to create a culture with one exaggerated trait. What happens when a species gives up emotion and devotes itself to logical behavior? You won't find a large group of people willing to try the experiment over a long period of time. In SF, though, you can present such a culture as a fait accompli and explore the ramifications. Other genres (except fantasy) assume that your story takes place in a more-or-less real world. That limits the leeway you have in stretching the boundaries of what is possible. That limits the questions you can ask about the preconceptions we have about the nature of humanity. Good fiction can make you re-examine your place in society. Good SF can make you re-examine your place in the universe. 

This is obsessive behavior: he's no longer in her life (so he doesn't know her whereabouts), but he still knows where she lives. It's even creepier in the next verse: 

The line is a bit of a pun. A "masque" is a masked ball, and in this case refers to the kind of music played at masques. The name actually has a somewhat convoluted history, originally referring to a masked drama in France, then to a stylized dance in Elizabethan England, and that use re-exported back to France. Despite the name a "bergamasque" is not a kind of masque. The name comes from Bergamo, a city in Italy. It refers to the kind of music there, based on a folk dance. That dance is thus Bergamo-esque (bergamasco in Italian, and bergamasque in French, giving rise to Bergamask in English). So "masques and bergamasques" puts together two styles of dance and music, both of which have Renaissance origins, even though the names are not actually related. 

It's entirely possible that Thomas Nashe wrote this passage, which would account for its dated references. Hunting deer was a sport for the upper class in Shakespeare's England, with its own terminology. A one-year-old deer was a buck, at two a pricket, at three a sorrell, at four a soare. The passage has a little fun by confusing sore and soare, then soare and sorrell. In the second line, then, only the third "sore" should be "sore," the others are "soare." In the third line, he adds the letter L to soare to get sorrell (in some versions it's ell, not L, playing on yell). In the fifth line, the letter ell becomes the number L. The difference between soare and sorrell becomes fifty, so Holofernes (naturally) multiplies. Thus sorrell = soare * 50. Some versions use O instead of one. The last line extends the previous "calculation" by adding another L to get 50 + 50, or 100. There could be a play here on the soft S, which looked like f (or 1), but I doubt it. 

Another example is the Nurse in Romeo and Juliet. There's great comic effect to be mined out of a large man playing the Nurse: just as the portrayal makes the man look un-masculine, the nurse looks un-feminine. And so when she makes coarse jokes ("Now, by my maidenhead -- at twelve years old."), the effect is enhanced. Falstaff, sneaking out dressed as a woman in Merry Wives is a similar gag. Now, this is a very careful comic balance for Shakespeare to walk, because he also played women in serious ways. He had not just great dramatic female roles like Cleopatra and Tamora, but great female comic characters for whom femininity is crucial. This is most visible in "cursed" characters like Beatrice in Much Ado or Kate in Shrew: the roles aren't funny if the audience doesn't fully accept them as attractively feminine. The audience would, of course, have been aware that these characters were portrayed by boys. Several of Shakespeare's greatest comic female characters dress as boys: Rosalind, Viola, Julia. Again, there's a delicate balance where the audience is being asked to accept that these are boys-playing-girls-dressed as boys. It worked only because the audience was fully imbued in the trope, and simply accepted it. I think of it as similar to the effect of intercutting in modern cinema: the world doesn't jump perspectives like that, but since you've been trained to accept that as the language of cinema, it doesn't give you even a moment's pause. It's not so much "suspension of disbelief" as genuine belief: that's the way this world works. Of course, they only believe it in the theater. They don't accept boys-dressed-as-girls in real life. Unless, of course, they're drunk. So the effect of using Bartholomew is to make the drunken guest seem more despicable, and thus funnier. It also helps that this keeps the prank as a "boy's club" moment. Women, especially young women, were usually portrayed as more refined in their sensibilities. Even low-born characters like Audrey in As You Like It (" I am not a slut, though I thank the gods I am foul") have some touch of propriety. Women do participate in pranks (like Mistress Quickly in Henry IV, part 1), but are usually less coarse about it. I'm certain Shakespeare could have written a woman into the scene without breaking the drunken-fraternity nature of the the prank, but it was certainly in character to make it an all-male moment. 

Some refer to the events themselves as the story, while the recounting of those events is the discourse. You can impress your friends by using the words fabula and sjuzhet, which mean the same thing in Russian. A search on "narratology" will give you all the information you need. 

One of the guilty pleasures of writing is that you create a world where you have absolute power. You place the scenery, you define the people, you make the rules, and you decide who lives and who dies. Whatever you intend for readers to take away from your work, you make specific statements with your plot. In a fairy tale, the hero overcomes obstacles with his bravery, wit, strength, or dumb luck. When he marries the princess and lives happily ever after, you have told the reader that that is his reward for having those qualities. Tolstoy states his idea of marriage by presenting two contrasting couples. Anna (the title character) is married to Alexey, but if he loves anything, it's his job. As long as Anna does what he expects of her, her other activities are tolerated. Anna falls in love with Vronsky, a dashing officer. She has never really loved Alexey. When she must choose between the two, she always chooses Vronsky. Farmer Levin loves Kitty, but he's awkward and shy. Kitty turns him down but goes into a funk. While recovering, she meets Varenka, an angelic figure who inspires her to re-assess her lifestyle. Levin also tries to lose himself, in his case with study and work. When their paths cross again, they are ready for marriage. In the end, love is not enough to save a relationship. Anna hides from her insecurity in drugs and denial, and she dies in a fall. Vronsky sees himself through Alexey's eyes and commits a form of suicide. As in a fairy tale, when you don't win, you die. Levin and Kitty examine themselves and find room for improvement. They have epiphanies. They want to be better people, and they work towards that goal. Tolstoy's reward for them is to live happily ever after. 

She knows that she has compassion, and wants it gone. That presages both her viciousness and her breakdown over the consequences. This isn't the speech of somebody entirely in her right mind, right from the start. There's another particularly horrifying sequence: 

The novel Shades of Grey has a subtitle, The Road to High Saffron, though neither the US nor the UK editions include that on the cover. The book ends in a way that hints at a follow-up. But his web site has no sign of a sequel, and his forthcoming book begins a new series. The concept is fascinating, and I'd love to see it finish playing out, though I suspect that there isn't that much left to be said. Is a sequel planned at all, or should I think of Shades of Grey as a complete work unto itself? 

Have you been to a library recently? In olden times, libraries had books. Lots of books. That was how you learned things. When newspapers and magazines came along, libraries added newspapers and magazines. When videotapes and DVDs came along, libraries added videotapes and DVDs. Each time they cut down on their books to make room. When the Internet came along, libraries didn't need books or newspapers or magazines or videotapes or DVDs. All these media will go the way of the clay tablet and the papyrus scroll. Now that we have the Internet, we can get the very best news and information, right? or at least the very best cat memes. Bradbury extrapolated a trend. Television, a new technology in his time, could have been used to enlighten and inform. Instead it became "the idiot box," "the boob tube." The government wasn't responsible for that. Networks show what people want to watch. Every day there's something new: spin doctors, echo chambers, infotainment, silos, alt-facts, anything to avoid reality. If it doesn't affect us directly, if it doesn't agree with our preconceived notions, let it burn. People who read books are dangerous, therefore books are dangerous. It's not true, but it's what people want to believe. Ostensibly, Fahrenheit 451 is about destroying books. In reality it's about destroying ideas, destroying even the capacity to have ideas, and in the end destroying our minds and thus ourselves. 

In Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell, the magician Norrell has cornered the market on magical books, which must have been a considerable expense. He also seems to have a considerable estate. How did he become so wealthy? I believe that the character's motivation is driven by the British peerage, in which titles and wealth go to people who have done important things, but inherited without evincing such merit. Norrell isn't a peer of any kind, and is ridiculed when the idea of giving him a title comes up. Wealth and title don't always go together, but there often seems to be a tension between the titled class and those who earned their wealth. So where did Norrell's wealth come from? 

Oblonsky is presented as a person who is everybody's friend. He's not an especially good person, though. He cheats on his wife. He makes a poor deal selling his land. He's not particularly good at his job. The reason he survives is because everyone likes him, but he's not sharp enough (or ruthless enough) to use this likability to his advantage. You probably know someone like him. Levin, on the other hand, doesn't have many friends. He prefers his farm to the city. He tends to focus on his own affairs, meaning he takes little interest in the affairs of others. He doesn't like small talk. Oblonsky is happy to talk to him, where few others will tolerate him. In other words, Levin has few friends, while Oblonsky has many. The relationship is asymmetric, but it works because Levin has no one else to turn to. Oblonsky could be smarter, more sober, or better at business, but as long as he's friendly, Levin will be his friend. 

She's re-living the moment (thus, the knocking at the gate, introducing the Porter scene). And she repeats her line, this time desperate to forget. She cannot, and soon she will be dead. 

This is a not-so-subtle commentary on the engagement of Perdita and Florizel: she is the wilder stock, though he can also see her latent nobility. She refuses that kind of breeding, through the metaphor of the gillyvor (carnation). The rest is a commentary on age and time, "a sad tale best fit for winter". It starts with rosemary and rue, both familiar from Ophelia's own flower speech: rosemary for remembrance, and rue as a homonym for regret. This is a moment where the last kings are passing into age, while Perdita and Florizel are the bloom of youth. Seasonal tropes recur throughout the play, a meditation on the the cycle of growing up, having children, and growing old.
