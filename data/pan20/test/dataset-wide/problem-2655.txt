It may help to view detachment as the absence of selfish attachment. Feynman's passion could be viewed as a selfless attachment. For more on this see volume one of Eknath Easwaran's three volume commentary on the Bhagavad Gita. In particular, consider the following verse: (4.10, page 226) 

The definition should replace the word “the” with “an”. The reason for this is the historic interest is finding ways to solve the problem of demarcation that would distinguish between science and pseudoscience. See Popper’s interest is labeling psychoanalysis as non-science in SEP. $URL$ The interest in this demarcation problem suggests there exists at least one orthodox science and at least one heterodox science rather than multiple scientific approaches that can be lumped together in a generic definition. If there were no interest is separating science from pseudoscience the word “the” would be appropriate as Geoffrey Thomas mentions in his answer. 

That the universe began to exist could be justified based on the discovery of the cosmic microwave background, the dark night sky paradox or entropy. However, the question is not about the universe but about time. Craig quotes Kant (page 65) who assumes a Newtonian view of time: 

Gregory Matloff has been attempting to scientifically test panpsychism by using the anomaly in stellar motions in Parenego’s discontinuity. Certain types of stars do not follow their expected paths based on gravitation theory. One could attempt to find panpsychism by looking for agents. One looks for agents where determinism breaks down and one is forced to consider randomness. Given randomness if it is not uniform, such as flipping a coin, something more needs to be explained. One explanation is that an agent is present. So testing panpsychism involves looking for non-uniform randomness. Whether anyone accepts this as science would be influenced by social mood more than metaphysics. At the quantum level this randomness is present and could be used as a justification for agency and hence panpsychism although one can easily ignore the whole issue. 

Based on Jonathan Haidt’s “The Righteous Mind”, when we “philosophically align with nihilism” we have made an intuitive decision to accept nihilism and then task our brains to rationalize that decision. The reasoning process may alter the decision somewhat but the intuitive decision is non-rational. See YouTube for some of Haidt’s views in particular “Intuition First, Reasoning Second” The point is one can find almost any position rationalized through philosophy or science including nihilism, whatever nihilism happens to be. Given this wide variety of differing views, how do we know that nihilism is true? If one wants to believe in it, that is, one’s gut decision says yes, then one can come up with reasons. As Haidt mentioned in the video I referenced just use Google to find them. The same goes for rejecting nihilism. If one is not happy with nihilism that complicates matters. It is like saying that one has intuitively decided to put one’s hand in a fire and the brain has rationalized doing so, but one doesn’t like the feeling of one’s hand getting burned. How can one not feel the pain of the burned hand and still put one’s hand in the fire? One could wear gloves which in the case of nihilism might be maintaining a healthy body, being wealthy and/or watching a lot of comedies to keep one’s spirits up. Alternatively, one could make an intuitive decision to reject nihilism and use one’s reasoning powers (and Google) to rationalize that new decision. The way I see it, life is short and happiness, I suspect, is easier to achieve without nihilism. It is like Pascal’s wager and the heaven I hope to enjoy can start right now. 

One could interpret a person trying to lead others out of the cave into the sunlight as altruistic. This person would be providing a benefit to others and be at risk for trying to do so. It would qualify as altruism since the individual potentially suffers and the group wins. Peter Singer’s “The Most Good You Can Do” describes “effective altruism”. To make this effective there are various ways to maximize the good that one can do. If there is something to maximize there are scenarios where what one does is not as good as it could be. For example, if one wants to maximize the amount of money one gives away over one’s lifetime, giving so much away initially that one cannot earn more money later would be a way to be too altruistic in terms of the ultimate goal of giving away a maximum amount of money. However altruism is a relatively recent idea. David Sloan Wilson in his “Does Altruism Exist?” writes in the introduction that it originated with Comte in 1851. It counters to some extent the selfishness in Darwinian evolution and it is not recognized by traditional religious groups who do not understand why the individual as a member of the community should not benefit when the community benefits. One could look at selfishness and altruism as individual-focused approaches to goodness. The traditional approach would be communal-focused where the individual would be expected to benefit from any good the individual performed since the individual was part of the community. From that perspective there is no way someone could do too much good and there may be nothing special the good person needs to do to benefit the community. 

The God of the gaps argument highlights the problem of not recognizing scientific research programs as social constructions. One can generalize the problem in the following way: Given a popular scientific research program must competing research programs fit into the anomalies or gaps of the popular program or can they remain independent? In the particular case of the God of the gaps the question is whether a popular deterministic research program that promotes useful results such as Einstein’s gravitation theory has room for God. If one accepts gravity or even evolution must one accept atheism? There are gaps in this deterministic program as there are in any research program. These gaps are characterized as indeterministic aspects of the theories that need to be explained better in the future. Examples of these are the indeterminism of quantum physics, the indeterminism at the origin of the universe and the evident indeterminism of our own human agency. The basic question for theologians is: Must theologians fit whatever God they promote into the indeterminism of a deterministic theory? That theologians are compelled to answer such a question means the answer is “yes” to the original question, that is, whether or not it's "correct" (logically) to invoke the "God of gaps" argument in a metaphysical debate? Given a deterministic research program that denies the agency of a God or our own agency for that matter, there are two ways theists, or more generally those who support agent causation, can approach that research project. In the first approach, the God of the gaps approach, theologians, or others promoting agent causation, simply accept the deterministic program. Then they opportunistically try to fit whatever God or other agency they promote into the indeterministic anomalies or gaps that the deterministic program has not yet closed or cannot close. An example of this would be trying to see how free will, a characteristic of agent causation, could fit into quantum indeterminism. For a theological example, see Alvin Plantinga’s “Where the Conflict Really Lies: Science, Religion & Naturalism”, Chapter 3. There he calls the approach “hands-off theology”. In hands-off theology nature is deterministic and God does not act as an agent in the universe. There are no miracles. God’s agency is restricted to creating and sustaining the universe. Plantinga points to Bultmann as a particular proponent of this type of position. Such theologians relegate God to the available indeterministic gaps of a deterministic theory and in the process abandon human agency. In the second approach, opponents of the popular research program outright reject the determinism of that program. They set up a competing research program where agent causation, not determinism, is a core principle and take over the results they want from the other research program. The indeterminism of the popular research program becomes unnecessary. It is discarded with the determinism. This is the opposite of a God of the gaps approach. It maintains the independence of both research programs. It does not stoop to fit into any other program’s gaps. What makes a God of the gaps approach possible is that people forget that all of our scientific research programs are social constructions. As social constructions they are supported by social mood which changes. Success of one program over the other is not whether determinism or agent causation are true. Believers in either side can call up data in their support. When they forget this, they assume competing programs must fit into the gaps of the popular program rather than remain independent waiting for social mood to change in their favor. 

Yes, if you want. The formal cause is only an explanation that may be useful or not but is always incomplete. It is presented for your benefit. So, it could be a bicycle bolted to a frame if that best helps you relate to the bicycle or it could be an art object or it could be some of both. Your question is not trivial. I hope the description above brought out two points: 

One thing to be wary of is the use of the phrase "within itself". It assumes that if something that belongs in some way to an object, such as its history, actually existed it would have to be within the object because otherwise a reductive explanation of it would not be easy. Keep an open mind. Reductionism isn't the only way to explain something. There is also an holistic approach to consider as well. Whatever it might be could be part of a field of some sort around the object or explained in ways no one has thought of yet. Since plants are alive it may be easier to see that they might store their history in some way. See Stefano Mancuso and Alessandra Viola's Billiant Green: the surprising history and science of plant intelligence. A stone, however, is not a plant. Could it store its history? Can it respond to human negativity? An attempt to detect responses of water to human emotional behavior was done by Masaro Emoto. Although water is not a stone, it appears to be closer to a stone than a plant does. See Emoto's The Hidden Messages in Water. Expect people to criticize such research but keep an open mind. As a fantasy writer you probably already have an open mind. Regarding fantasy writing, socionomists who predict a coming bear market would also claim that people will be more interested in the magical during that period. As long as your writing stays clear of rationalist science fiction themes, your writing should have a growing audience assuming socionomists are right and a long term bear market is coming soon. 

People believe in many things that they have no proof of existing. One example would be dark matter. It is posited as existing so that Einstein’s gravitation theory is not falsified, but no one has found any. As another example, some people believe in parallel universes to explain the indeterminism implied in the quantum collapse. No one has proof that any parallel universe exists. Such proof would falsify all other quantum interpretations. That doesn’t stop people from believing in the existence of parallel universes. So, it is not just religious people who believe in something that they have no proof of existing. When it comes to religious ideas, child developmental psychologists have shown that members of the human species have an innate ability to detect agency where innate means that the ability is not caused by culture nor individual rationalization. This innate ability gives us an evolutionary advantage because we can separate agents such as lions to be wary of from non-agents such as stones that we can safely make use of. It also leads to belief in agent causation and even non-material agency. Although one might say these agency beliefs are delusions, perhaps they are not. There is no proof that non-material agents don’t exist in spite of people believing they don’t exist without proof of their non-existence. Perhaps it is the belief in non-agents that is delusional or rather convenient so we can build tools and structures out of them without fear. See Justin Barrett’s Born Believers for an overview of research along these lines. However, having an innate belief does not mean that it is a justified true belief. Are there any justifications for general Christian belief? One justification might be found in Alvin Plantinga’s Warranted Christian Belief. Let’s consider the question: How do people believe in something that they have no proof of existing? Although religious believers have no proof their religion is true, those opposing them have no proof that it is not. However, they do have, through such philosophers as Plantinga, warrant for their beliefs.
