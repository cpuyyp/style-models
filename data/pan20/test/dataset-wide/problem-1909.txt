Every company I have ever worked for has provided corporate guidelines for setting and modifying annual performance goals. And every company I have ever worked for has different "rules". You need to coordinate your actions with your manager, with your company guidelines and with the repercussions that may occur based on your actions. I'll try to answer the specifics in terms of my company's current rules, but remember - your mileage may vary. Talk to your Manager, Talk to your HR. Consult your own company guidelines first. 

If your skill matrix indicates "how skilled you feel" then it doesn't matter at all how you acquired the skills. Include all of your skills, those you acquired on the job, those you acquired in college, and those you acquired anywhere else. 

As with most misunderstandings, the solution is to talk with the parties involved. Find a quiet time to chat with your manager individually. Thank her/him for the praise, explain how his/her praise really helps to motivate you. Then point out cases where you were praised for mundane tasks, but not for challenging tasks. Help her/him see and understand the difference between the two, and how that makes you feel a bit conflicted. This is your chance to educate your boss. Use it! And conclude your discussion with another "thank you" for the praise and support, while ensuring him/her that you will continue to work hard to earn more praise. 

Assuming you are in the US, this is completely normal. This information is needed to report your work payment to the IRS. You also need to specify your full name and address. If you were simply selling an image to the company other payment methods would be appropriate. But since you were contracted to do work, the IRS needs to know, and these are normal details for reporting. Remember, you can always ask a potential customer why they need specific information from you, if you are suspicious. If you pursue contracts in the future, learn what you need to provide before accepting the contract. If there are any items requested that you don't want to provide, don't accept the contract. 

Your basic choices are - come aboard full-time, or reject their offer and move on to a more under-control company. Nobody can actually tell you what you should do in that regard - that is solely a choice you must make on your own. If you do choose to stick around, you should do whatever your boss tells you to do. That means ignore the Mark/Jim drama. You are not in charge here. You don't supervise Mark. You don't supervise Jim. From your description, it sounds like your boss (the president) needs to do a better job of supervision, or delegate it. You said that you don't want to be in the middle of this. So don't. There is absolutely no need to make this your problem - just do your job and let your boss do his. Or decide that your boss is hopeless and move on to a company that knows how to manage such a team. 

Not in my experience. I've never hired someone at below the stated minimum. And I've never been offered a job at below the stated minimum. 

You possess a Bachelor's degree. You do not yet possess a graduate degree. Thus, you must list only the Bachelor's degree on the job application form. In your cover letter, you can discuss the graduate degree and when you hope to complete it, along with any other not-yet-attained potential achievements. 

Because you are in charge, it's up to you to make sure it happens. You can direct members of your team to inform everyone themselves. But if they don't do it, then you must. If it is important that coworkers know when one of their team is out of the office, you should check to see if that team member has already informed others about the absence. If not, you should do so. Some shops have morning or weekly status meetings. That is an ideal place to mention the list of team members who won't be around in the upcoming time period. That's how I handled it with my team. I made sure they always knew when I wasn't going to be around. And if the team members didn't announce it themselves, I made sure everyone knew when others weren't going to be around. That way everyone could plan for the absence accordingly. 

You could choose to hold your breath and start putting in only minimal effort if you like, but I suspect you already know that won't really get you anywhere. If this give-versus-take balance is really that problematic for you, you might be better off finding a new job that lets you text freely, rather than shutting down in this one. 

I suppose it depends on how badly you want the job. If it were me, I'd show up at the store bright and early at 11am. I'd talk to whoever was working, in hopes that they would either know something about your arrival, or know how to get in touch with the manager. If I cared enough about the job, I'd reschedule my week as necessary. 

There's one other option that you don't see for some reason: Submit your real salary expectations. That way, you have fulfilled the stated requirement and the company now knows what you expect. If their budget doesn't meet your expectations, they won't call back. But then you wouldn't want them to call back anyway, since you expect more than they can deliver. A range might be acceptable to most hiring companies, provided your range isn't too wide, and you would actually be happy with an offer anywhere within the range. You'd be wasting your time submitting $X - $Y per year if you wouldn't be willing to accept $X. You'd also be wasting your time if you submitted the equivalent of $0 - $infinite. If you "highball" you might get lucky. But you are more likely to just have your submission tossed. If you submit a vaguely-worded expectation, you'd likely be wasting your time. Any company requiring your salary expectations isn't going to let you dodge the question - otherwise why would they bother to ask? You could to choose to treat these jobs listing as red flags. It's reasonable to avoid applying to a job whose listing bothers you. But obviously, you would be narrowing your choices (needlessly, in my opinion). If your goal is to find a good job where you can negotiate back and forth a lot and in that way feel like you will get the maximum dollar that the market will provide - some employers don't want to play that game. You can choose to walk away from such employers. If on the other hand, your goal is to find a good job that will meet your salary expectations, and also meet your other job/career needs - then it seems reasonable to provide your expectations and see where it leads you. 

Going deeper in one area is a reasonable reason to change. Again try to emphasize the "Y-ness" that you see in the new job, but don't dwell on X - particularly if you see some X in the new organization. 

Not necessarily. A vendor-customer relationship is important. A vendor wouldn't want a customer to think they were poaching the customer's clients. It's a tricky situation for a vendor to be put in the middle like this. I've worked on both sides of this situation and I can't say it surprises me at all that the vendor would choose their relationship with the customer over a job applicant. It seems reasonable to me for a vendor to call the customer and say something like "I wanted to let you know that one of your employees has applied for a position with out company. Before we decide whether to interview or not, we wanted to let you know that we didn't solicit this individual, and to ask you if it would be okay to continue?" It would be less okay if they simply said "Hey, your guy Jim Smith just applied for a job with us." To be honest, I'm surprised that the company employee (Brent?) applied for a job with the vendor without first obtaining a promise of secrecy. Bad move on his/her part. 

I suspect you already know this, but you simply have to learn to say "No" when it is warranted. If you truly have very important tasks, you can either say something like "No, I can't help you this time, I have to concentrate on the task I have." or "No, I can't help you right now. Perhaps later, once I have finished my task." Sometimes, you can use your boss as the excuse - "Sorry, [boss] wants me to get this task done, so I can't help you. If you think it's important enough, we could go to [boss] and ask if things should be re-prioritized." Depending on personalities, experience, and the work hierarchy, it can often be uncomfortable turning down a request for help. Additionally we sometimes unconsciously want to be known in the office as "the guy or gal who helps everyone". But if doing so gets in the way of completing your tasks, then you are shortchanging both yourself and the company. Try saying "No" a few times. It will be hard at first, but you'll learn that it gets easier with time. And you'll likely also find that your colleagues will understand.
