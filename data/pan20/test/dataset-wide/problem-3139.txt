Thomas Midgely, Jr.'s hands were in two of the most detrimental scientific breakthroughs of the 20th century: the proliferation of leaded gasoline and the use of Freon (a chlorofluorocarbon) as a household refrigerant. Recently a colleague suggested that there was another inventor or team working on a household refrigerant alternative at the same time as Midgley and his team, and that both were working to beat the other to patent their solution first. I have spent a great deal of time researching Midgley and his legacy, and I never saw any mention of a 'race to the patent office.' Is there any truth to this assertion? At the very least, was there even another team working on a solution? 

Helen Tilley spent the better part of a decade investigating development in Africa, especially in relation to British Parliamentary funding of resource projects addressing issues like clean water, mosquitos and flooding. Her most recent book, Africa as a Living Laboratory: Empire, Development, and the Problem of Scientific Knowledge, 1870-1950, is a thoroughly-researched and well-written text. Especially useful is the lengthy appendix providing primary source data taken from British Parliamentary Papers (take a look here). 

At this time, upturned collars were detachable, and were notorious for being quite uncomfortable and stiff. The modern iteration of the 'popped collar' is summarized especially well in the aforementioned Wiki article: 

The new book, The Man Without a Face, by Masha Gessen is at least partially intended to humanize Russian leader Vladimir Putin in hopes that it will eliminate the power he appreciates by maintaining a fearful reputation (as is discussed in her interview on The Daily Show here). Has a book ever been so incendiary, so revelatory that it resulted in the leader it criticized being removed from power? I acknowledge that there are likely many factors contributing to the downfall of an oppressive leader-- what I am after here is an instance where a book can be cited among the causes of a leader being removed. 

Since then, the shirts have transcended to popular culture and other sports. Think Diane Keaton in Annie Hall, James Dean in Rebel Without a Cause or Manchester United star Eric Cantona. Today, popped collars enjoy a mixed legacy and reputation. While many people still use them in the same way René Lacoste intended early in the 20th century, the frat bros and 'wannabes' use them to attain that 'preppy' look. While it is a so-so reference at best (it's hard to find any sources on this subject that aren't dubious), this site provides an interesting supplement to the Wiki article mentioned above. 

Firstly let me say that this question was so nice I decided to do a bit of research into this and was done for the joy of knowing about rainbows. So let's see how people around the world thought about rainbows. 

Greco-Roman - It was a path made by Iris to connect heaven and earth. Chinese - A silt in the sky sealed by the goddess Nüwa using stones of different colours (gems maybe?). Another one is about Hsienpo and Yingt’ai. Who are star-crossed lovers who must wait until the rainbow appears to be alone together. Hsienpo is the red in the rainbow, and Yingt’ai is the blue. Australia and oceana -The Rainbow Serpent is a huge python-like creature. However, the color of the creature tends to vary - some say that this creature is celestial blue, others say that it is multicolored, and others say it had yellow and red stripes down its body. The variations in color is due to the fact that there are many different areas that have the rainbow serpent as a part of their mythology - Australia, Congo, Dahomey, Haiti, Melanesia, Nigeria, Papua New Guinea, and Polynesia. 

Indian - The rainbow is referred to as "Indradhanush" which translates to the bow of Indra, the thunder god and the king of gods (analogues to Zeus). And we say that he shoots lightning from this bow. Bible - The genesis(9:13-17) tells that after Noah's flood got over god put a rainbow as a message of goodwill. Armenian - It is a belt of Tir, which was originally a god Sun, and then - god of knowledge. Norse - A rainbow bridge called Bifrost, which connects Earth with Asgard, home of the Norse gods. Bifrost can only be used by gods and those who are killed in battle. It is eventually shattered under the weight of war - the Ragnarok (German Gštterdammerung). The notion that the rainbow bridge to heaven is attainable by only the good or virtuous, such as warriors and royalty, is a theme repeated often in world myth. Irish - The end of the rainbow is the leprechaun's secret hideout. This is where he keeps the pot of gold. But for some cultures it's not all sunshine and rainbows! Rainbows can be a bad omen in these places. Amazon - Rainbows were thought to cause skin problems Karens of Burma - The rainbow is considered as a painted and dangerous demon that eats children. Ancestral times in Japan - Rainbows were often viewed as omens of bad luck because they represented snakes. Bulgarian legends - It is said that if you walk beneath a rainbow, you will change genders: if a man, you'll begin to think like a woman, and if a woman, you'll begin to think like a man. While most people in the capital don't believe in the superstition, some of them tease each other and joke around. They might also say "The sun is shining, the rain is falling, a bear is getting married". Ancient Slavs - A man touched by the rainbow is drawn to heaven, and becomes a "Planetnik" - half-demonic creature - which is under the power of the thunder and lightning god Perun.
