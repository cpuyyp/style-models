In the case of Henry the Fowler, Memleben is probably his favoured residence. Wallhausen, where his son built a palace, is essentially in the same neighbourhood. Thus, the whole region might be considered Henry's "ruling seat", insofar as he had one fixed seat of power. 

Background: Abullah & Co was one of the biggest South African trading concerns during the 1890s. At one point the company operated 15 branches and imported from Germany, India, and England. However, there were tensions between Dada Abdullah and his cousin Tayob Haji Hkan Mahomed, who managed the company's Transvaal branches. In 1890, Tayob bought out the firm's Transvaal operations and incorporated them as Tayob Hajee Abdulla & Co., but then fell short on the payments. The ensuing legal dispute led to Mahatma Gandhi's employment by Dada Abdulla. 

As a bride, Marie Antoniette might have been disliked by some due to the longstanding conflict between the two dynasties. But in terms of legitimacy, I'm not sure what could be illegitimate about being an Archduchess of Austria. Indeed, I'm not sure how one could ask for a more legitimate bride than a princess of Europe's most prestigious royal house. In fact Kings of France had been marrying Habsburg princesses long before Louis XVI: 

Why Bimetallism? This reflects the temperaments and philosophies of those who drafted the Constitution favouring bimetallism over either gold or silver singly. As the prominent economist Francis Amasa Walker wrote: 

Lowbrow culture have always existed in human society, they're just not necessarily that well preserved in the historical record, or in modern popular consciousness. Jokes about sex, farts, penises, and bodily functions in general were particularly common. A mainstay of medieval entertainment was fart jokes, which seem to be popular throughout human history. One was even recorded on a Sumerian tablet and may claim to be the oldest recorded joke. In 12th century England, a man by the name of Roland the Farter famously held a serjeanty in Suffolk, in exchange for performing, "every year on the birthday of our Lord before his master the King, one jump, and a whistle, and a one fart." That farting is normally considered offensive is self-evident - Emperor Claudius is even said to have passed an edict declaring farting permissible. Roland and his kind provided humour by acting as boorish fools, a target for mockery. Hence despite their apparent acceptance as entertainment even among the upper class, Medieval elites nonetheless looked down upon the act. For instance John of Salisbury angrily ranted that: 

Barbarian presence in the Jin Empire, early fourth century. Blue denotes the various Xianbei tribes; orange is the Five Xiongnu Tribes; pink represent the Di people; green is the Qiang people and yellow is the Jie people. Smaller groups include ancient Koreans (purple), native Shichuanese (red), and other nomadic groups that were driven out of the steppes earlier (dark green, brown). A native Chinese state reconstituted itself in 317 as the Eastern Jin, but never mustered the strength to retake the north.North China did not return to Han Chinese rule until an (ostensibly Xianbei-assimilated) general usurped the throne of the last Northern Dynasty, Xianbei Zhou. In conclusion, the idea that the Great Wall forced the nomads west does not make much sense. They were in fact extremely active and relatively successful in China throughout this period. 

But either way, this was not most of his forces. The principal means by which Charles raised the royalist army was to issue commissions to regional supporters, authorising them to recruit regiments privately. These were mainly issued in late July and early August. It would have been reasonable for reach regiment to take a month to be assembled. For example, 

Greek was in wide usage as the lingua franca of the Near East. It also has the benefit of actually surviving Roman rule, in the same capacity, all the way till the Late Antiquity. The Romans themselves read and spoke Greek. Thus, Greek works have had a much greater chance of surviving simply from a great, wider, and more durable distribution. The Etruscan language, on the other hand, was never that widespread. It also reached its height much earlier than Greek; most surviving Etruscan dates from around 700 B.C. Having been conquered by Rome since the third century B.C., the Etruscan heartland was completely subsumed into the Latin civilisation at time when Greece was thriving. The Etruscan language had largely gone extinct by the time of Claudius. Apart from perhaps some priests/scholars, Etruscan works would have been unintelligible to almost anyone who might possess Greek books. Given the highly limited, if not outright extinct, readership, it is unsurprising that Etruscan literature were mostly lost. It would happen both from natural attrition over the centuries, as well as in the ravages of Late Antiquity wars in Italy. The (better preserved) religious Etruscan texts were lost in warfare around the same time. So in summary: 

It was probably always the norm, at least in a way that also tolerated concubines. The Ancient Greeks were of course descended from Proto-Indo-Europeans. As early as 1864, French historian Numa Denis Fustel de Coulanges reasoned in his magnus opus, La Cité antique, that marriages were monogamous from the earliest days of the Indo-European peoples. 

An illuminating case is his response when a group of Muslims and Hindus were found guilty of sedition. 

Addendum: in addition to the emblem book, Charles Thomson worked with the draft proposals of the earlier committees. Two of them also proposed using eagles. The first committee, for example, included the Imperial Eagle of Germany. It was in one of six quarters the on the committee's shield, alongside French, Dutch, Scottish, Irish and English symbols, denoting the European countries whose people had populated the United States. The eagle appears in the bottom left quarter. 

In all honesty I'm inclined to think his numbers were manipulated chosen specifically to inflate Jewish participation in slavery. 

Not all of Europe followed the same pattern. Southern Europeans women were more likely to marry young to older men, although ages were generally still around 20. A landmark study[7] of 1427 Tuscany reveal the mean age of first marriage there to be 19 for women, but 28 for men. Subsequent studies[8] on 15th and 16th century Florence confirms that all women married when 18 to 19, to men between 27.7 and 31.2. However, men with higher socioeconomic status tended to marry older, a trend not reflected in women's marriage patterns. While the Florentine situation is often regarded as unusual, it is not unique. Another study[9] of 15th century Ragusa showed that women were on average betrothed at 18, but gave birth to their first child when 22. From this the authors surmised that Ragusan couples consummated their marriages when the women were 21 and men 36. In this case, local cultural norms seemed to be the main culprit. 

Note that I'm looking for the legal concept of freedom of religions being actually applied for Native American beliefs; not whether the concept should have applied. 

Still others list the the official adoption of the Democratic Party name in 1844. However as far as I can tell there are no readily apparent evidence (e.g. cited resolution/proceedings) the back up these assertions. 

In other words, it was only a problem because lucrative business opportunities made it financially profitable to risk making the voyage under less than ideal conditions year round. 

Even if the communists had done well in this one operation, their overall inactivity could quite reasonably be considered ineffectiveness. Which, again, they didn't -their campaign soon stalled as Japanese units rallied. Chinese histories tend to very conveniently end the Hundred Regiments Offensive here. In reality, the Japanese counterattacked deep into Communist heartland. By 1941 the Communists had lost over a quarter of their forces and the population under their control shrank by 45%. 

(Disclaimer: definition of race varies. Wikipedia offers this: "a grouping of humans based on shared physical or social qualities into categories generally viewed as distinct by society" and that is the view taken in this answer. Some of you prefer to define race by skin colour, in which case feel free to ignore Aristotle.) Racism is a very ancient concept. Aristotle famously argued that non-Greeks were inherently inferior races, naturally suited to being enslaved by Greeks. 

What little Calvinist presence still lingered were largely wiped out after the mid 17th century. Confronted by invasions and foreign occupation, Polish Catholicism was galvanised by John II Casimir of Poland with the Lwów Oath. ** 

Yes, Nazi Germany did deploy naval assets. However, what little they could get into the area proved essentially futile. This did include U-boats. 

Technically speaking, a Khan is the titular sovereign ruler, whereas a taishi is "merely" a high ranking official. They're mutually exclusive positions, but did not always correspond to who was more powerful at a given time. In general, public opinion in Mongolia reserved the title of Khan for the descendants of Genghis Khan, while tribal leaders often took the title taishi. This was not limited to the Oirats. In fact, it's not an Oirat word at all. Originally, taishi was an ancient Chinese government rank also known as the Grand Preceptor. It was traditionally the most senior of the Three Great Lords of State, theoretically the three highest ranking members of a Chinese government. In practice, these positions were often left vacant or used purely as honorifics because monarchs perceive them as threats to the throne. 

Although the coin is quite worn, you can clearly on the reverse the inscription , meaning senatus consulto. This confirms that it is a Roman coin and probably one from an early period. Based on the size and colour, your coin could be a dupondius which was worth 2 as or 1/8 of a denarius. In the early imperial period, this buy you perhaps one to two loafs of baked bread depending on the local prices. The busts on most Roman coins face the right, so this is somewhat uncommon, and further points to something pre-Severan. It's hard to positively identify without inscriptions, though the obverse - to me anyway - looks rather similar to the Divus Augustus on this coin issued under Titus: 

Roman soldiers generally did not fight with their lovers by their side. Remember, Roman soldiers weren't even allowed to marry during for the first two centuries of the Principate. Periodic scandals involving officers abusing their subordinates were attested in the armies of the mid and late Republic. Valerius Maximus, the main source of these incidents, reported that the military tribune Marcus Laetorius Mergus was condemned for molesting his adjutant. During this period at least, it seems clear that relations between fellow soldiers were punished - often with death. Apparently, Romans did not like the thought of "one of their own" being penetrated. However, homosexuality with male slaves was quite mainstream in Roman society. Or at least, penetrative (on the part of the Roman) sex with his own slaves were quite acceptable. In this regard it seems the military did not function differently from the rest of their society. For example, Marcus Valerius Martialis wrote a poem commemorating a centurion friend, Aulus Pudens, and his relationship with his slave boy Encolpos. Unlike the case of a Roman being penetrated, here the passive partner/victim was already considered degraded and further defiling wasn't of concern. Additionally, it was common and probably expected that soldiers would rape captives in a war. This included both women and the boys. That also extended subjected peoples. For example, the Revolt of the Batavi was said to be in part provoked by the Roman military's sexual assault of Batavi boys. In this scenario and that of the sex with male slaves, the homosexuality would seem to be an expression of manly virility.

Much of the ultimatum could be deemed unreasonable. But with regards to being unacceptable, Serbia actually folded to every Austrian demand and accepted all terms except one: 

[2] In his 1497 letter, John Day, reporting on the John Cabot's discovery of Newfoundland, wrote of the discovered land that: 

Plautus seems to assume his audience would recognise who was, an indication that the epithet may have predated his Mostellaria. It appears the Romans began styling Alexander as "the Great" shortly (relatively speaking) after his death. The reasons are of course obvious, as @TomAu and @WladimirPalant have explained. 

Because the British Nationality Act gave Commonwealth citizens free entry into the United Kingdom in 1948. This coincided with post-war labour shortages. As a result, market demand recruited large numbers of migrant workers into Britain. It is this availability of jobs, not mere disparity in GDP, that attracts immigrants. However, it's inaccurate to characterise the immigration as taking place at any particular "point" in time. British Indian and Black populations didn't suddenly explode right after 1948; the flow slowly increased over many years. As late as five years after the war had ended: 

Thus, the military forces of the free world rallied to South Korea under the banner of the United Nations. While many were also American allies, they joined the fighting not out of treaty obligations to the United States, but instead as member states of the United Nations. 

Moreover, even by those who opposed the new Constitution agreed with this interpretation. An article in Philadelphia's Chronicle of Freedom actually cites judicial review of legislation as a reason to be against the Constitution: 

Not only did the war began with a distinctively religious cause, it also ended on a religious note as the lands of Cirrha were made sacred. 

It was definitely ballast as @pluckedkiwi suggested. Many ships provisioning Rome had to carry ballast on their return trips for want of a more profitable cargo. It was usually sand - Rome had a guild of subuarii (lit. "sandmen") for this purpose. I have also read volcanic ash being used for reselling at construction sites on the route to make concrete. 

What this actually means is that if a free person (citizen or otherwise) was wrongfully held as a slave, a friend could go to the Praetor to seek their release. Note that this was basically a civil trial, and the slave owner would be able to put forward a legal defense. It fell to the Praetor to determine if the purported slave was in fact legally free or not. Therefore, the law did not help the average slave. Note that they could not simply go to the Praetor themselves, and would instead need someone plead their case. Even assuming that a champion could be found, there was no reason to expect that they could prevail against the slave owner. At least, not if the acquisition was made legally. 

Such appointments were already increasingly unpopular towards the end of Meiji, and went into crisis in the first year of Taishō (1912). When the genrō nominated Katsura Taro as the next Prime Minister, they provoked a massive backlash in the Diet that forced Katsura to resign. Despite this, the genrō retained control of the Prime Ministerial appointment process and continued to allow their personal distaste for party politics or specific politicians continued to factor into their decision making process. At the same time, however, The elders became more sensitive to the need for support within the Diet. 

Additionally, Chinese settlers established lasting colonies in the Pacific, such as Hainan or Taiwan. These were very much comparable to the overseas settler colonies of Western European powers, such as the Spanish and Portuguese in South America, or Britain in Oceania and North America.
