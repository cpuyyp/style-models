Although this should be a given, ride the bike before you buy it. Not for 5 minutes in a parking lot, but for a real, decent ride. Any shop specializing in 'bents will understand that if you are making your first recumbent purchase, it's a leap of faith, and will be accommodating. That is also a reason to buy your recumbent from a specialty shop. Credit for the following goes to @Don Kirby above, I'm including it here as well for completeness in one answer. If he wants to edit, and add the above paragraph, or similar, I'll delete this answer. Think about wheel base and where you want the steering. Wheelbase: I hear that long wheel base is more stable and faster, but I chose short wheel base so I could load it on the bus rack sometimes. Steering: Above seat steering is more common and I think it's easier to learn, but I chose below seat steering because it seemed like a more relaxed position for my arms. Bonus: I found that during a crash, below seat steering means that your completely above the bike and you don't get tangled up with it as you go down. I found myself sliding along the ground, all by myself. 

I know calorie counts vary quite a bit, but a rough ballpark for cycling at a 20 mph pace is 450 calories per 15 minutes according to this calorie calculator. Running a 6 minute mile is expected to burn a similar 450 calorie count on the same calculator with the same settings. So, if you do the math, and the calculator is assumed to be reasonably accurate, then 5 miles on a bike at 20mph, is roughly equivalent to 1 mile run at a very fast pace. Running a half marathon, which is 13 miles, and ignoring any difference due to endurance of effort, 13 miles at full pace running could be assumed to be a similar effort to 65 miles on a bike, in a very general sense. This is dependent on fitness, body weight, and many other factors. The best method to work it out would be to measure power expended, but I don't know how to do that for running, and to be accurate, you'd need to do it yourself, and for the full distance of the half marathon. 

You can, of course, jury rig a Truing stand as others have mentioned, and you can build without a way to measure the tension on the spokes. Without a lot of practice and skill, though, your wheels will be less than perfectly strong and straight. You should use a thread locker on the spoke nipples. Ideally, Spoke Prep from DT Swiss, or Linseed Oil, which acts as a lubricant until it dries, but acts as a thread lock once it's dry. The book at the end of the list will teach you the theory behind how a wheel is built and why, and the lacing patterns, and what works best, and why. 

By the way, the app I used to do the calculations and the charts here is called Gear Head, it's on the app store for iPhone and iPad, and it's the best tool I've found for these kinds of calculations. I like it, but I don't have any other connection to it, just for the record. 

Yes, pressurized water can damage your bicycle, specifically by washing the grease out of bearing areas. Note, this is pressurized water. Using a garden hose without a sprayer is unlikely to do damage. Using a garden hose with a shower type sprayer is unlikely to cause damage. Low pressure, so that it doesn't break the seals, is the point. (I avoid the risk, anyway, because I can't afford to be wrong, and how much pressure is OK depends on the strength of the seals on your particular bike.) A car wash, or any other pressure washer, is pretty much guaranteed to do damage. Washing by hand, with a bucket, a car wash brush, a toothbrush or gear brush, and some non-detergent based soap is the safest way, and with a little practice and preparation, can be done in half an hour. Some detergent based soaps react to aluminum, and can cause serious damage to an aluminum frame or parts over time. Make sure you use an aluminum safe soap. You can make things easier by using a repair stand to hold the bike, and removing some parts, if you have the tools and knowledge, but that's a bonus. Other than that, it's just elbow grease. 

In practice, a 20mm travel gain is within acceptable use range for almost any bike. It will change the geometry, but only slightly. It will also change how the bike handles for steering and braking, but again, only slightly. If you aren't adding a huge amount of weight or leverage to the bike, there should be no issue with the frame. You should make sure the setup is correct for the new fork. It will not have the same sag and spring rate(most likely), and should not. You should probably take it a bit easy on your bike for a ride or two, while you get the feel for how your bike will handle with the new fork. Aside from that, enjoy the new fork. 

I recently came across this product:, which is a stainless steel shield to place between your mountain cleats and your carbon soled shoes, to prevent damage to the carbon. Has anyone seen something similar for a road shoe? 

A derailleur for your mountain bike should match the specifications on the original derailleur. That is, while it doesn't need to be the same model of derailleur, it does need to be the same brand, in almost every case. It also needs to match the number of gears, or have more intended. Meaning a 7 speed will fit for 5 and 6 speed bikes. An 8 speed will work for 7 and 8 speed. A 9 speed will work for 8 and 9 speed, and sometimes 7 speed (but no promises.) A 10 speed mountain derailleur has more limitations. It may work with 8 or 9 speed, or it may not, depending on model and brand, and other variations. It is the newest, and least tested, with non 10 speed systems. In addition, the cage length, either short, medium, or long, should be the same as the original. If you don't know what yours is, then long is the safest bet, but you may also need to change the length of your chain. The difference between long and short cages is the amount of chain the derailleur is able to absorb, which in turn determines the size of the gears you can run, particularly as relates to the front chainrings. The large plastic pulley derailleurs you have seen are called Mega Range derailleurs. They are generally used for department store quality bikes, or hybrids, and are definitely not intended for a mountain bike. They give a very easy climbing gear, but are low quality, and often shift very poorly. I hope that helps. If you need more info, feel free to ask.
