It's true that since the Earth is not a point, an observer in the upper atmosphere directly above that point on the surface would not be at exactly the same radius from the Sun as the radius of Earth's orbit (defined in terms of the position of the center of the Earth), but if you actually do the calculation of the solar constant at the radius of Earth's center vs. the radius of the point on the surface that's closest to the Sun, the difference is very small so it can be ignored if you're only stating the solar constant to nearest Watt/meter^2 or even the nearest tenth of a Watt/meter^2. The nominal solar luminosity is defined to be $3.828 \times 10^{26}$ and 1 AU is defined as 149597870700 meters, and if you use the formula you mentioned to calculate the solar flux at 1 AU it works out to 1361.1664654 watts per square meter. The radius of the Earth at the equator is about 6378 meters, so at an equinox when the Sun is directly overhead at the equator, an observer seeing the Sun directly overhead should be at a distance of 149597870700 - 6378 = 149597864322 meters, if you use the same formula to calculate the solar flux at this radius you get 1361.1665815, so it only makes a different if you want precision beyond the second decimal place. 

Imagine you have a solar collector measuring one square meter, which can directly measure the power (energy per unit time) striking it. If there are layers of atmosphere above the collector, some of the incoming light is absorbed or reflected by particles in the atmosphere, so you won't measure as much power as if you place the collector in space at the distance of Earth's orbit, with no atmosphere between you and the Sun. But if you place the collector in the upper atmosphere of the Earth, the density of atmospheric particles above you is so small that they absorb/reflect only a negligible amount of power. Orientation is also an issue--you'll get the maximum power if you orient the plane of the collector so that it's perpendicular to the direction of the incoming rays. If it's not perpendicular, then if you approximate the incoming radiation as a set of parallel rays which each carry an equal amount of power (a standard approximation in optics) then fewer rays strike the collector when it's at some angle that's not perpendicular to the rays. All this is illustrated in the following diagram (from this page), with the two possible orientations of the solar collector illustrated in gray, and the light rays illustrated as black lines: 

Apparently you don't fully appreciate the results of gravity. Try to model a fluid sphere (for our purposes here, a collection of rock, liquid, and gas is semifluidic) such that somehow there's less gravitational pressure near the center than near the outermost shell. Can't happen. Next, think about trying to make chunks of lead, or granite, float on top of a pond (of liquid water). Won't happen. Your last question is kind of pointless - there are "rocks" with densities both greater and less than the density of pure iron. 

Depends a bit on whether you want to compare diameters or volume (3D). For radius, consider that it's approximately 6.6 A.U., so if you dropped it into the Solar System it'd extend out to well past Jupiter's orbit. Or it's the ratio of a standard tenpin bowling ball to the point of a sewing needle The volumetric ratio is 1420^2 or about 2 million to one. That's roughly one person out of the entire population of Houston, TX. Or the ratio of 100 liters of water to a single drop from an eyedropper. 

This is one of the current questions of cosmology/physics. So far all evidence points to the negative inside a black hole so far as quantum numbers go, but it's not clear what you're considering as "prior state." A simple counter-example is a camera. Once the photons are absorbed by the film or solid-state sensor, all phase information is lost. Is that what you were looking for? 

Atmospheric absorption has some serious peaks near 750 and 920 nm, which is one reason to place these cameras in orbit above the atmosphere. 

For one thing, hexagons tile the plane -- meaning you can build as large as you want with one shape. Granted in practice this won't work because there are different curvatures, though again all hexagons at a given radius will have the same curvature. In addition, the likelihood of damage at the tip of a "pie-slice" is great, the aspect ratio (length-to-width) sucks, and remember that minimizing the longest dimension is critical to controlling cost and fab time for any mirror section. Add most of the info in the initial comments as well. Further, if you had pie slices it'd be just about impossible to 'refocus' the system, while local hexagons are relatively easy to deal with. 

So apparently the "covariant entropy bound" (also known as Bousso's holographic bound) is the thing to look into when considering the maximum entropy of the universe (and I assume you just mean the observable universe here rather than whatever may lie beyond it). This set of lecture slides by Raphael Bousso, the physicist who originally proposed the covariant entropy bound, says that this bound is "conjectured to hold in arbitrary spacetimes, including cosmology." But it also says "If correct, origin must lie in quantum gravity", probably meaning one can't derive this fact in a non-conjectural way from basic laws of physics without having a complete theory of quantum gravity. For an introduction to this stuff, I recommend this Scientific American article that discusses various holographic bonds, including the Bekenstein bound along with Bousso's conjectured more general bound (the article was written by Bekenstein himself). Though it is from 2003 so I'm not sure what kind of theoretical progress has been made since then. Anyway, here's what it says about Buosso's entropy bound: 

That is also the only point on Earth where an observer on the surface would see the Sun "directly overhead", at the very top of the apparent dome of the sky. So even if you stripped away the Earth's atmosphere, only at this point on the Earth would the power reaching a square meter of the surface be equal to the solar constant, the average power per square meter over the entire illuminated half of the Earth's surface would be less than the solar constant since most of the surface is at an angle relative to incoming rays. Incidentally, the angle of the surface relative to incoming rays is also the main reason why at Northern latitudes, it's warmer in the summer (when the surface at a Northern latitude is closer to being perpendicular to oncoming rays) than in the winter (when the surface is at a more inclined angle relative to incoming rays), as illustrated in a diagram from this page: 

Not sure what you're asking here. Pretty much any telescope will be unable to simultaneously produce infinity (magnified) output and an aberration-free intermediate focus. Further, an aspherical wavefront can't be produced purely by a radiating point source (all objects are collections of point sources), so no optical system can refocus an ugly wavefront. The way a Shack-Hartmann WFS works is basically not to care about aberrated images. Each subaperture's image is unresolved to begin with, and all the sensor needs is to determine the approximate centroid location. 

The obvious answer is to use a telephoto lens -- or any other magnification scheme. As an extreme example, if you had a post 1 km tall, the shadow of its top (think sundial) would move pretty clearly. If you re-image a short post, or just re-image the sun itself, which enough magnification, you'll see the motion. This is kind of the same as trying to observe a celestical object with a high-power telescope. If you don't have an equatorial mount, everything in your field of view will move quite noticeablly. 

You're missing the point: it's called "dark energy" not because it's dark or because it's energy. The name is the cosmological equivalent of the "black box" in a laboratory setting. Until we figure out what the heck it is, there's no reason for it to follow our known laws. 

No, not really. The first thing is that we know that ${H}$ is far more abundant than other elements or simple molecules in the universe. The next thing is that the 21 cm line comes from a relatively unusual hyperfine splitting, and there just aren't any other sources near that wavelength and in intensity levels that can easily be detected. In most cases, astronomers have other methods of estimating objects' speeds, so any measurement of 21cm apparent redshift that was inconsistent with those estimates would be an indication that the wrong line was being observed. 

But again, this bound should be the upper limit on the entropy of a given region, not necessarily the actual entropy in that region, so this type of holographic bound shouldn't imply that when we increase the entropy of the universe, the universe needs to grow. This paper specifically discusses how most matter-containing regions in cosmology apart from black holes would fail to "saturate" the covariant entropy bound, meaning that the actual entropy in the region is smaller than the maximum possible according to the bound. 

The solar constant is defined to be the power you get on such a surface of unit area if it's not being obstructed by atmospheric particles, and if it's oriented perpendicular to incoming rays so that it receives the maximum possible power at that location. One aspect of the orientation issue that's important to understand is that if you orient your solar collector so that it's parallel to the ground (so that it would be lying flat if it was actually at ground level), then it will only receive the maximum power if the surface of the Earth is itself perpendicular to incoming rays from the Sun at that point, which is not true in the above diagram. It would only be true at the point on Earth that's the dead "center" of the Earth as seen by an observer looking at it from the Sun's position, or the point where the gray line connecting the centers of Earth and Sun intersects with surface of the Earth on this diagram: 

Holographic entropy bounds are upper bounds for the maximum amount of entropy a given region can have, rather than its current entropy--for example, the spherical region of space just large enough to enclose the Earth and its atmosphere would currently contain a much lower entropy than a spherical black hole of the same radius, whose entropy is given by the Bekenstein bound. The scholarpedia article on the Bekenstein bound mentions the issue of cosmological entropy bounds: 

Note that the latter four stars are in zodiac constellations - this is because those constellations lie on the ecliptic. For winter/summer which is which? Well the sun comes up in the east, so earth rotates counter clockwise, so it travels around the sun counter clockwise. We know that after the line from the sun to the earth points toward fall, it points toward winter. So whichever is left of Pisces in the sky would be the winter one: 

Note that the four zodiac constellations we got are evenly spaced throughout the year, and that the months associated with them are 6 months off from the seasons we mapped them to. This is because the zodiac months are assigned based on where the sun is in the sky. You never see a zodiac's constellation at night during the month associated with it. 

What is earth tipped toward? The simple answer is Polaris. The axis (one end of it) points at Polaris, so that's what it's tipped to point at. But when we saw "toward" what do we mean? When it is tipped "toward" one thing, what is it being tipped "away from"? If earth were not tipped then the equator would lie in the same plane as earth's orbit. Earth being tipped 23 degrees means it is tipped 23 degrees "away from" alignment with its orbit. So a 0 degree tip would be "not tipped" and a 23 degree tip is tipped 23 degrees in some direction. What direction is it tipped in? Another way to ask this would be, what would it be tipped at if it was tipped a full 90 degrees in the general direction in which it is currently tipped 23 degrees? Imagine a coordinate system with two axes in the plane of earth's orbit and one axis perpendicular to that plane. Earth's orbit stays in the plane, and the angle that earth is tipped points to, let's say, negative X. So the line through the north pole and south pole lies in the XY plane and the earth's orbit lies in the XZ plane. I want to look at stars and be able to see those axes, so I want to know what stars they roughly point at. A cleaner way to ask this might be, what would be the north star if earth wasn't tipped? What would be the south star? What if it was tipped 90 degrees? That gives four of the six stars I'm looking for. I'm not sure how to phrase the question for the other two. I want to call these stars "untipped north", "untipped south", "winter", "summer", "spring", and "fall" because the direction of the stars would be the same as the direction earth is from the sun during the extremes of those seasons (northern hemisphere). [EDIT] The plane of earth's orbit is aligned with a celestial (infinitely distant) great circle called the ecliptic. It inversely happens to also be the path through the sky that the sun takes over the course of a year. There is a latitude/longitude coordinate system where the equator is the ecliptic called "ecliptic coordinates". So the question is actually: Using ecliptic latitude and longitude, what 6 stars are at: 

The answer is either "no, of course not," or "yes, in a pathological sense." A radio "telescope" captures photons which are capable of forcing electromagnetic responses in metal -- which is to say, the induced voltage caused by an E-M field. The statistical odds of a visible-range photon causing an induced signal of detectable level in a metal antenna are ridiculuously small. 

To expand on Rob J's answer: Try for nights when the forecast is not only clear but no wind. And almost invariably the best seeing is on the coldest winter nights, again in absence of wind. Other things that affect seeing include: altitude (top of a mountain is already above the densest part of the atmosphere), and making sure your telescope is set up long enough to be in thermal equilibrium with the local environment, so that there's no updrafts right next to the telescope. 

I'm not sure how to define the "edges" or obscurations in a case of gravitational lensing. The image we produce on Earth is the combination of our local telescope lens elements and the "grav lens" a zillion Kessel Runs away from us. Even if you use the premise that the black hole itself is a central obscuration which should cause a Spot of Arago, I don't think any other diffraction-like effect is observable from such a great distance. All the wavefronts of light which passes thru the GravLens region continue to expand, ending up near-parallel from Earth's viewpoint. 

From a quick drive around the InformationSuperHighway, I'd say the answer will remain a complicated mess :-) . I did find a reasonably non-mathematical discussion at universetoday 

The chemical makeup of space dust -- the stuff which agglomerates into planets -- is dependent on the history of supernovas and neutron stars and the like which created the atoms in a given region of space. This is unlikely to bear any relationship to the size or age of the star around which said items revolve.
