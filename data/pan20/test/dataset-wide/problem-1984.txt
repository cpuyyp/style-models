It is a personal issue so most people would come up their own answer. For some it is the way things are and there is nothing you can do. For some others it might be better to try to work around it than to oppose it. Although things in UK, from which I draw most of my experience are not even remotely so harsh as in India the issue still exists. (Note: a person wrote about exposing this to the world and if this should be kept as a family secret, well the whole world knows because Indians are everywhere and the cast system is maybe the second if not the first thing you learn about the culture. Cast system is more well known than Diwalli or Ganesha or Shiva, moving on). My answer to your situation was the decision to work only for US based/international companies or for local ones that have specific safeguards against discrimination. Some of these have to do with if there are rules and time-lines or positions, promotions, career paths, etc. The hope is that if people move to companies that do not discriminate, these companies will perform better either because of talent allocation or because the employees are more motivated or even have something to prove. Eventually the ones that behave based on casts or something similar for other countries will be outperformed and they will stop doing business. If these do not operate where you live and work, move (bold statement)! What you have do deal with in these environments is tick-boxing (how else can we ensure meritocracy?) and being treated as a case rather than a person (to ensure non-discrimination). There is also many times American-centrism on how the rules are being set (aka some of these might be very irrelevant to India) and enforced. This is the "be the change you want to see in the world"/evolutionary/Darwinian approach. An alternative perspective is to deliberate on which point this "glass wall" becomes visible. I believe that a glass wall is exists in every country but in a different level: In the US you have to be very high in the organizational pyramid to experience, in UK/Europe an in other places you sense it in middle management, and in India, as you mentioned, seems to be everywhere. 

If the conference you were sent to provided you with information that could be useful to some of your other colleagues, my suggestion would be to create a document that summaries all of the information you receive over the course of the conference. You could then upload this document to a central repository that is accessible to all of your colleagues. Following this you can send your boss an email with a link to the location and ask him if they think it could be useful to distribute this link company-wide, or if there's any changes to be made before doing-so. The benefit of this is that to be able to reply to you, your boss will have to at a minimum scan what you have prepared. Even if they don't look thoroughly, they will be able to see how much information you have gotten and therefore how valuable it was to send you. Furthermore, you are sending only one email (therefore not spamming your boss' inbox) and moves the focus away from you "trying to impress your boss" to "trying to do as good a job as possible". 

My supervisor didn't have mark my thesis, and he gave me some tough-love feedback because he wanted me to do the best I can do. It may be possible that everything he's saying is coming from a good place! My advice to you is to write for your markers. If you know that your supervisor is going to be marking your thesis then take his pointers and incorporate them into your work as much as possible. It will not only improve the quality of your work (in his eyes) but will show him that you respond to feedback and that you're not too proud to admit that "maybe I can do this a little bit better". However if you know your supervisor is not marking your thesis, and you're aware that whoever is has very very different personal criteria for what makes work good (through past experience perhaps) then it is 100% okay to go against some of your supervisor's advice. Whatever the case, should try to remain respectful of you supervisor - at least academically and professionally. 

I understand that there have been many questions on this site asking what to do if someone is not enjoying their job, and I'd like to stress that is a different scenario. Since leaving university I have had two graduate software engineering jobs. The first I left very quickly, as I wasn't enjoying it, I wasn't a cultural fit and I didn't like the atmosphere - I was dreading going into the office every single day. My second job I have fit in much better. I like being in work and get along with all my colleagues. I work for a fantastic company in a really interesting sector, but I'm starting to feel like a liability. I have to be taken through many steps as I struggle with the some of the work on my own. I understand that there's a learning curve with any job, but the other graduates I started with have been getting along fine and I'm starting to become very aware of my abilities. Having given this some thought, I think I'm just not cut out for software engineering, whatever it takes to be a good developer I don't have. I love technology and it's an industry that I want to stay in, but actually sitting down and writing code for x hours a day is not for me. I know I needed a software engineering job to come to this conclusion, but now I know I feel a bit guilty for being a waste of a resource. I have spoken to other departments to see if there's any project management opportunities (I think this is where I would thrive) but unfortunately it doesn't look like it. Graduate opportunities for project management are opening up in other companies and I do feel like it's a now-or-never move into this career path. Is it better for graduates to quickly find what they want to do/are good at and get entry level positions in those jobs etc, or is it more important to work up through the ranks towards a goal, even if you're not going to enjoy the journey? Is experience in a particular role more important than experience in an industry as a whole? 

My take is that your experience does not increase or reduce employability, it changes it: for some places you will be more employable for some others less. 

With the truth: You can mention that your co-worker passed away (supposing that there is a way to prove it) and you should also be able to produce evidence of the freelancing work you did together (invoices, reference letters, if not code samples?) I would suggest that you maybe contact your previous customers and ask for a reference letter that would describe the nature of your work, if possible. For such cases, I scan the letters or print emails as PDFs and have them available in a way that I can retrieve them from a browser (dropbox links, personal site etc) so that proof can be produced easily and I don't have to carry tons of paper for every interview. 

I believe that the term has been diluted a lot in the recent years because of hype. It has to do with what you define as a Startup. One definition, paraphrasing Steve Blank, is that a startup is a "temporary organization in search for a business model", so one you have stabilized your business model, you are no longer a startup. In theory this is irrelevant to time, but if you are searching for a business model for 10 years... People also confuse start-ups (introducing something new) with companies that start-up, like use a traditional bakery as an example. This happens a lot recently that people are more interested in entrepreneurship and also because there is some overlap. In that case I would say that a traditional business leaves the starting-up phase once things have stabilized/matured (establish a presence, clientele etc), let's say when the rate of change drops. Again 10 years are a lot, maybe not for space/pharmaceutical. In any case in order to have a "right" answer, we need to look for how people define "startup". Counter example: try to market your company a startup in order to attract specific talent, while it is not. Additional material: A taxonomy of startups, from Blank mentioned above: Steve Blank: The 6 Types of Startups. 

I have done the mistake of accepting a job offer because of the tough interview. Answering your question: Companies when moving fast or becoming large have a tendency of not updating the processes. They also get progressively stuffed with people that "just" want to do their job and go home. So given a list of interview questions they will not challenge if it is fit for purpose, they'd just ask them to you and then provide their assessment. Another approach that I have seen which is also wrong, is the hope that if a company recruits better and better candidates then somehow auto-magically the department will start to get better and better. The problem is that they don't improve the processes or their approach to doing business or managing their teams, so you just add unhappy employees feeling taken advantage of - someone like you :-) I think the effort should be on how to shield yourself from having the same experience in the future. I'd suggest: 

After I graduated University 7 months ago I took up a job offer that I had been presented with working for a start-up company. The offer had been negotiated and the plan was for me to come on board at a low salary initially, then after 12 months the salary would double when the business got going. The salary I am on/started on is approximately minimum wage and I could easy get 2 or 3 times what I am earning now at another company. Actually it works out at roughly half of minimum wage if I were to work it out based on the number of hours I work. The start-up company is run by a friend of mine who I have known for a few years so I trusted that this promise of an increased salary would be fulfilled and we could make it work. When I came on board the start-up was a completely new company and no work on it had been started. I have been working flat out on it the past 7 months doing 95% of the work while the owner spent most of his time on another company of his. The owner and I are the only two people involved. The other company is complimentary to this new one and I have also been spending some of my time on that as well. Essentially I have all the technical knowledge whereas the owner is more of a sales person. Without my input and skills the business would not be able get going and if I left it would fail completely. There is not enough money to hire someone else at the bare minimum salary I have been working for and if we weren’t mates beforehand I never would have accepted the wage going into this project. The owner didn’t really have a good idea of how long a project like this would take so it has taken about 4 months longer than he anticipated. I also foresee it growing at a much slower rate than was suggested by the owner when we were negotiating the initial wage. The long term plan is for me to split my time evenly between both the businesses when this start up launches. I will be doing all the technical aspects along with online sales and business development for both businesses while the owner attempts to achieve sale face to face. It is likely that I will be doing about 60% of the work on the existing company and about 75% of the work for the start-up company. If I had known that I would be taking on this much of the work for the companies when I started I would have asked for some sort of equity compensation to make up for the low salary and significant contribution. The start-up should be launching soon and I have come to the conclusion that I don’t want to be building up someone else’s business portfolio for years only for them to sell it when it becomes a success. I want to ask for some sort of equity compensation or look at a way to get equity in the company in return for an investment but I am not sure how to approach it. It is unlikely that the owner will want to give up 50% of the company but ultimately I feel that’s what would be fair for my contribution. If two people are running a company and doing roughly the same amount of work then it doesn’t seem appropriate for one person to own everything while the other person gets nothing. If ownership is not split equally then I feel I may become resentful and we will have a falling about at some point. Any advice would be appreciated.
