One reason I can think of is the nature of the true name. Whether it's a demon, a table or a person, the true name is called a true name, because it's not something you just call someone. It's a representation of everything that person or thing is, and everything that makes up that person or thing. A true name is like a definition of that person or thing's complete character. Therefore, if you recite/know the true name of a demon, basically, you know it's full character, including strengths and weaknesses, so you'd be able to defeat it. Another possible reason is that the demon itself just internally breaks down when it hears it true name. Because it knows that the true name is a definition of what it is, and what kind of being it is. So when it hears the name, it just breaks down, hearing how truly horrible it must be. I guess it's similar to someone shouting at you all your imperfections and mistakes and the things you hate about yourself all in one shot. Magnified like a thousand fold. 

First letter of each word/sentence makes up the message. Or first/second word of each sentence. That way, you can encode any message, and at the same time you're free to write whatever crazy stuff you want your madman to spout. :) 

It's accepted that the mind controls the body by electrical impulses between neurons and down the spine and along nerves, etc, which allows us to move an arm to pick something up. However, what stops us from using the same concept to pick something up without touching it? My character can send out electrical impulses from his brain like the rest of us do. Except, instead of remaining within his body, affecting his movements only, the impulses could travel through the air, or whatever medium he's in, directed by him of course (like we can direct an impulse to our hand, not our leg when we want to pick something up). Then, he can move things around without physically touching them. Distance would matter as it takes more energy to send an electrical impulse further away from you. Using this concept, he can also manipulate matter at the atomic level, removing an electron or neutron from the atom, like how we'd assemble Lego bricks. He can then manipulate matter, and light and other forms of energy. Whether he can interfere with the electrical impulses in other people's brains and read or change their thoughts, I have yet to decide. But basically, thanks to this, he can feel everything around him to the particulate level, just like we can feel what's happening to our bodies. What possible problems could arise from something like this? 

Firstly, feathered wings would be a nightmare on humans, mainly cos we're naturally not feathered. We have skin, and so our wings should also be covered in skin, yep, like a bat. Otherwise, you'd have an overload of biological and logistical issues, like how can the winged human take a shower/bath with soap? The feathers would get gummed/ruined. How would the blood circulation in the body work out? And what happens if the human falls down in mud on a rainy day? Mud would cake the feathers... So to be realistic, skin-covered wings would be better for humans. Also, the wingspan would have to be very long. About 15 feet from wingtip to wingtip for the average-height human adult. How best to connect it the body, well, it would be better if it connected directly to the spine, like all our other limbs. So maybe the wings could connect either directly in the middle of the back or spaced slightly apart (but must be between shoulder blades, otherwise arm movement would be impeded). The connecting area between the wing and the back could be from shoulder-height down to maybe mid-back or three-quarter ways down. Any less and the wings would be liable to tearing off when faced with a strong force. Blood circulation would, of course, have to include the wings. As to hiding it on a day-to-day basis, the best way would be if you could draw out a design for your wings so that it can support the human's weight, and yet it can also fold neatly along the back. The batwing design would be a little difficult here because the long 'fingers' make it difficult to fold easily. You can see a picture of man's arm, bird's wing, and bat's wing here. What would be ideal is the skin-covered wing of a bat, but with the bone structure of a bird. Windbreakers with special slits in the back can be used, so that the wings can be hidden while the jackets are worn, yet in an emergency, the wings can snap out of the slits. With regards to adaptations in the human body, of course, the bones would need to be lighter. Maybe not hollow, because our skeleton would need to still support our bodies, significantly less dense. Muscle structure, also less dense, and the human must have very little fat or he/she'd be lugging around a lot of extra weight. Heart compressions must come faster to support the beating of the wings (which need to be very strong), and so diets would need to change too. On average, the human-bird would need maybe twice to three times as many calories as a normal person. Also, birdlike air-sacs in addition to lungs would be very useful, as well as something that may allow them to breathe in the lower-pressure atmosphere when they fly. Basically, the human has to be as light as possible, and yet strong. 

Yes, it exists in the fantasy world. Or something close to it. In the Wings Series by Aprilynne Pike, the main character is sort of a human-plant hybrid, though she is called a faerie. Females of her species bloom for one quarter a year (spring faeries bloom in spring, etc), where a flower blossoms on their backs, and if a male of that species is around a blooming female, his body produces pollen on his hands. Faeries need to be in the sun as much as possible, and they only eat fruits and vegetables. I suppose if you want it to be purely science-fiction, you could try splicing human and plant DNA? Biologically, the change in DNA would do your work for you, but physiologically, you might have to deal with flowers and pollen (how would such hybrids mate) and more basically, the fact that chlorophyll may be produced by the body, causing certain parts of the body to turn green. Then, you'd have to see if the chlorophyll in the body is enough to power the person completely with just water, sunlight and CO2, or if he needs extra nourishment, in which case, a non-vegetarian diet might not agree with him. 

Hmmm oxygen? Going at such high speeds means he needs a lot of oxygen. I mean, he'd probably need massive amounts of food and water as well to keep going, but you can't really control that... If you can saturate a particular area with a bunch of chemicals that suck out oxygen, and trick the speedster into the area, you'd have a fair chance of catching him. The chemicals used have to suck out most of the oxygen from the air. Perhaps place the chemicals (in crystal form or in huge hidden vats) in your trap area. Of course, timing is important. The chemicals can only be exposed to start working moments before the speedster arrives. Also, for obvious reasons, your team would either need to be far away (not likely) or be equipped with oxygen tanks. Lure the speedster into the trap somehow. (Due to the lack of adequate info in the question, I can't say how to lure him. If he's a villain, put jewelry or other steal-able stuff. If he's a hero, lure him with a helpless victim or a scream for help.) Alternatively, set the trap up around his home, and activate it once he gets comfortable. Then he'll be trapped by the lack of oxygen long enough for your team to move in and put him in a cage or something. (Again, due to lack of info, not sure what kind of cage would the speedster be vulnerable to. Best bet, go with those electricity-induced laser bars things. You know, if you try to put your hand through, it'll just get sliced off...) Yes, him being a speedster means he should be able to run out of the trap really fast. But because he's so fast, he really needs the oxygen, or he'll also suffocate really fast. So the faster he can go, the more he'll need oxygen, and the easier it'll be to trap him this way. If you really want to take him alive, wait till he drops of oxygen deprivation, cage him, then quickly give him an oxygen mask again to resuscitate him. If not... Well, the chemicals would do your work for you... 

Zombies are terrifying, but if you think about it, they're not really smart. They see a target, they run for it, they attack it. Throw them in an empty room with no other people/animals, they'd have no idea what to do with themselves. They might try to escape, but they'd probably just try to bash their heads against the walls or door. What you might need is a virus, where it zombifies people, but doesn't instantly turn them into mindless savage beasts. So they can think their way around us normal humans who are trying to kill them... 

Well, that would depend on a few things: 1. Yield of bomb 2. Depth of bomb 3. Type of rock in mountain 4. Size of mountain The size of the mountain has been dealt with. Type of rock would have to be specified. Dense rock would, of course, hold up against a nuclear blast much better. Yield and depth of bomb would also have to be specified (an atmosphere/surface blast would not be very damaging). The amount of destruction would increase with the depth of the bomb until it reaches a certain point, where the rock would begin to contain the blast, reducing damage area. The maximum depth for highest effect depends on the yield of the bomb. So, with a high enough yield device at the right depth, you could even destroy the mountain, but every speck of it would come falling back as highly radioactive fallout, which would then be spread by any wind. Of course, in this case, the denser the rock, less it will travel as fallout. If, however, the blast does not destroy the mountain, someone standing on the other side would probably be protected from the physical damage, but would die of radiation sickness soon. Someone standing on top of the mountain would experience something akin to an earthquake, and he would get most of the radiation right in his face, since the fallout would probably rise to the top in the mushroom-cloud shape very fast. This is assuming he does not get roasted to death...
