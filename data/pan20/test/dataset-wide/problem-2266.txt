I like to use a pot which is 8.9 cm wide (3.5 inches) - because anything bigger would be a waste of space and weight for my needs. It's identical to a Toaks 750ml titanium pot. Most of the stove systems I tried, are inefficient with that pot since they produce a flame that is too wide, goes over the border of the pot, and wastes fuel by heating the sky rather than my water. I am experimenting with some DIY alcohol designs to find which is more efficient with that pot, but I wanted to know if someone already made some tests and came to a conclusion. I am quite skilled with DIY so a complex design wouldn't be a problem. Living in Europe, availability of some source materials, could (like, aluminium red bull bottles are almost impossible to find here). 

Short answer: If the tree is a living and thick one, then it was OK. That being said, there are several reasons you should had done a proper anchor with multiple points (trees, in this case) and equalized, and then walked back again to the top. One simple drawback of your approach is, that the friction between the rope and the tree trunk, when you recall the rope after the rappel, can be harsh to the rope sheath and abrade it. And your rope costed more than the quickdraw you wanted to recover. It would unlikely cut it (and you would already on the ground anyways) but would it be worthy to damage the sheath of your expensive rope? Also you could, although unlikely, misjudge the solidness of that single tree. Having two points (trees) is of course going to be better, since we're talking about something you're about to hang your life from. That being said, what we usually do here in the Alps (where is most of the time, if not always, impossible to reach the top of the crag by other means than climbing) is to leave behind a maillon rapide in place of the quickdraw when this situation happens. A maillon is much cheaper and many people carry one just in case. 

I have plenty of gear and I live in a small apartment. I am planning to buy an outdoor closet to put on the balcony to get some extra space. Here's a sample to show you how it would be like. 

So, I don't know what are those tests, but yes there is at least one standard (or two, if you may dare to count the UIAA as another one). I would contact the ebay seller asking informations about this. There's no mention to any certification in the listing though so those crampons are likely not certified by any mean. 

Assuming it's very impractical to get down to reach the tree line; and that the wind is changing direction very often - so a setup with several sides closed would be preferred - what would be a good tarp setup for very strong, direction changing winds? The kind of tarp I am interested into is the square one (that's what I have), 3x3 mt or 2.5x2.5 mt. Possibly, it should provide room for two persons, eventually leaving the gear out. Thank you 

I guess those are using a different standard. How do those ratings compare? I think it's critical to have a mean to compare the two kinds of rating to get an objective idea. 

Unfortunately there isn't much you can do if your rain jacket is not breathable. My recommendation is to replace your rain jacket with a poncho, which may be very cheap - while a highly breathable rain jacket cost hundreds of dollars. A poncho is much more ventilated than any jacket and will allow the moisture to leave your body by leaving it way drier; especially for an activity that is not physically demanding as walking the dog. The drawback of using a poncho is it's "flappiness" in high winds, you may need to put a cord around your waist to hold it in place (there are ponchos that include a waist cord already). Hope this helps. 

For instance. Will a silnylon tarp lose any of its features (elasticity, water resistance) if exposed for a very long time to high humidity? And the like. Thanks so much. 

OK, I finally tried the setup inspired by this site, which can be fully closed by pegging the sides closer to the middle, and pegging it directly on the ground on the opposite side of the entrance. 

Unfortunately it looks like the manual isn't available online. This is a page with some more comments about the device. 

It would be quite a tight night and you would need to leave your rucksack out, if it's big. But I was able to put the sleeping bag out of the bag from the entrance and to enter it whilst remaining under the tarp itself. That would be harder to do with a sleeping bag with no zip. Also the sleeping bag will be somewhat compressed at the foot where there's less height space. It would not be your coziest night ever, but indeed it is possible to do a completely enclosed setup. 

Assuming you're reapplying the screen often (sweat washes it away) and it's a quality one, then it would do for what matters sun protection (although you should still properly cover your head with a hat or a bandana or whatever). That being said, I would use a shirt anyways; to protect your skin from the abrasion of the rucksack, to absorb some sweat, and to protect your guts in case of wind or light breeze that could somewhat affect your digestion, in the long run. :) 

I am reading this highly-rated book about avalanches and I was impressed by this sentence, in its beginning. 

Now for the tying itself. I will keep things simple and assume that you will have something sturdy to attach your rope to - that means, trees. It would be of course pointless to assume that you need to also carry cams, nuts, piton, and other rock climbing gear. So, you have trees. If there aren't trees in the hike you're planning, don't even bother carrying that rope. 

I wouldn't label this as a "myth" tout court because it may depend on the very single piece of gear, I mean it's material, design, and manufacturing. While one carabiner may not suffer from being dropped from a significant height, one other could. Just like Black Diamond states in the very text you quoted, "if only light scratching is visible and gate action is still good, there is a good chance it is fit for usage". A good chance doesn't mean certainty. A dropped carabiner may retain almost all of its strength, if not all of it. And in most cases, just "almost all" may be more than enough. *Still, it is true that you don't know what happened inside of it and you don't have any chance to know it. You may use a rope that's damaged in the core and not in the sheath. That can happen, and it is hard to inspect and notice. Nevertheless, it's somewhat possible. But, inspecting the inside of a carabiner is just not possible in any way. So, I simply wouldn't label this as a "myth", and I would not use a piece of gear that sustained a significant fall for climbing any longer (I may still use it to rack gear or the like, though). 

If your basement columns are made out of reinforced concrete as I suppose, get a metal stud finder to be sure not to drill the steel and just go for it. Use a chemical bolt (see here: $URL$ for an example) by following its instructions and then happily go for it. Source: I hung a hammock that very way, and bolted a 'rock climbing' anchor indoor to practice with ropes and knots as well. Of course this is only true in case you have a concrete basement. 

Yes, that book is quite odd being aimed to beginners, so it should at least explicitly give some more information about that. That being said. If you want to do that, here's one way to (there are several). I did this in the past to help a party of less experienced people cross a slope full of unstable snow.
