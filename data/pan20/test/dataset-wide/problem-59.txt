A large habitat is going to have a water cycle Humans, animals and plants all cause considerable evaporation of water. This will condense on the coolest parts of the habitat and run down till they reach the "lowest point" (or in the case of habitat rotating to simulate gravity, the widest point.) All this water should run down and collect in a single large lake, where it can be stored and reprocessed. The lake can be used for recreation, too, just like earth reservoir. Untreated water is drawn from the lake and reprocessed prior to pumping into the purified water supply, just like on earth. Care would have to be taken to keep this separate from the sewage system (just like on earth...) 

"anti-magic" exists. think DnD's anti-magic field or dispel magic, this would obviously need to be usable by non-magic humans so perhaps there are certain "magic-less" areas that occur naturally and normal's have built all their settlements around them, perhaps there is some material which is resistant to magic perhaps there are machines with anti-magical abilities, perhaps magic goes away every eclipse the list goes on. there are gods/god-like beings/spirits with a vested interest in either normal humans or in preventing magicians from gaining to much power. these could also be a source of anti-magic. perhaps only the faith of normal humans feeds them, perhaps they just fear magicians. normal humans would not need to know of their existance Magical creatures exist that normal humans have bred and trained. (think dragons, sphinxes, giant anythings's or perhaps even vampires or werewolves.), while magical people could also train these it would certainly level the playing field Long term exposure to magic destroys complex machinery. in this way your non-magical people could have anything from muskets to tanks to balance out the magic and magical people would not. (if you have few enough magical people its possible they just don't have the economies of scale needed to build high-tech stuff). Non-magical people simply vastly outnumber magical people, and are reasonably well organised and united. this is not unprecedented many historians believe the reason Homo sapiens out competed Homo neanderthals is simply that we had better cooperation even though neanderthals had most other advantages. You would of course have to come up with a lore reason why Mages don't just reproduce like mad with fertility spells or something but hey. this works quite well with a variant of number 4 Magic is so wild and unpredictable that Magicians pose as much of a threat to each other on the battle-field as they do their enemies. This would make fielding them on the battle-field nigh impossible Killing another human being using magic has side-effects of increasing severity, making using magic to wage war or worse genocide undesirable for all parties involved Magic is dependant upon some reasonably scarce resource, perhaps most spells require gold or a special spice which is a hassle to grow. they where in charge of the world for a great deal of time until event X, the recent state of affairs is an outlier. some pick and mix of the above reasons. 

I'm not entirely sure this is a worldbuilding question because there are solutions already being implemented. But heres a go. Diversification it doesn't make sense to go 100% solar, there are other resources, that are easier to match demand with. It means fossil fuels will be around for a long time, but hydroelectric power stations can be ramped up and down, and even run in reverse: $URL$ . Wind can also complement solar reasonably well in some parts of the world. Daily storage Peak electric consumption occurs in the first hours of darkness. Only about 6 hours of storage are required. This can be met with batteries, but this is expensive. There are several types of battery for large scale storage being developed, for example $URL$ and $URL$ Concentrating solar plants use a field of mirrors to heat a thermal fluid, which is then used to generate steam for power generation. The thermal fluid (often a molten nitrate salt) can be stored for several hours. Longer term storage The only viable option for seasonal storage is chemical, and even that is a bit impractical / expensive. Water can be split into hydrogen and oxygen, but hydrogen is bulky, and expensive to compress or liquefy. Extracting CO2 from the atmosphere to make synthetic hydrocarbons is not practical, because the CO2 concentration is so low. There are several industries that use large quantities of hydrogen, the most relevant of which is the ammonia industry. Nitrogen from the atmosphere can be reacted with hydrogen to make ammonia, which is much easier to compress and liquefy than hydrogen. Ammonia is currently used in the fertilizer industry, but it can be used as a fuel, or decomposed back to nitrogen and hydrogen. Unfortunately ammonia from solar hydrogen will be several times more expensive than ammonia from plants that use hydrocarbons as feed and fuel. Solar energy could be harnessed in several other ways. One way is the enrichment of biomass. Wood and similar fuels are carbohydrate, which means that their chemical structure contains a lot of hydrogen and oxygen. On heating the material chars, which means the hydrogen and oxygen are given off as water: sugar C6H12O6 ---> 6C + 6H2O The resulting charcoal has about double the energy content of the original wood, so converting wood to charcoal using solar energy would halve the amount of wood that needs to be collected. Solar thermochemical plants People tend to think of converting solar energy to electricity, and then using it to hydrolyse water, but the process can be carried out using just chemistry and solar heat. It's more efficient that way, but the plants are quite complex. One of the more promising reaction schemes is the Sulfur-Iodine cycle $URL$ As I said before, such plants are currently undercut by hydrogen produced from hydrocarbons. In the future this may change. 

More likely though is its simply known as "the stone that gives you cancer" and is steered well away from 

A nineteen year old can look quite adult, especially behind the usual dirt, facial hair and attitude changes that tend to come after an apocalypse. There's no need for anyone to know he's an adolescent. Espacily if he's not necessarily a paragon of virtue. Alternatively you could lean into his adolescence trying to lead in hard conditions when many of the people beneath you think that you're "actually just a kid" is a hard struggle. Generally in writing struggles for your protagonists can be embraced, I personally would read about a child ruler desperately juggling internal politics, managing subordinates and rivals alike regardless of any zombies. Finally its possible you don't even need a justification, the walking dead is primarily a world gone mad. Child rulers have exsisted in the past and I'd happily follow a twelve year old in twd 

There are salt flat regions near the Nile itself. Perhaps the largest is the Qattara Depression. The great bitter lake, now flooded with seawater as part of the Suez Canal, was once a salt flat. During the building of the Suez Canal, a small parallel canal called the Sweetwater Canal was built to supply fresh water to the area. The water came from the Nile via Lake Timsah. 

Use the normal metabolism. It is unlikely that it would be possible to build up high pressures of CO2 in this way, though, without making the blood too acidic. Use CO2 from her fire breath, if any. This would be highly inefficient, and would again have the problem of generating CO2 at ambient Go to a frozen wasteland and eat CO2 Eat chalk, and use this to generate CO2, through the reaction CaCO3 + Acid = Ca salt + CO2. The acid could come from normal metabolism. As for 4, except the acid comes from an external source. For example, the dragon may go to a volcano and feast on brimstone (sulphur) which she could then burn (producing fiery breath without the inconvenience of having to generate large amounts of fuel through metabolism.) When she is not breathing fire, the dragon may slowly convert the sulphur to SO3 and H2SO4 in her belly, and react these with chalk to make CO2 under pressure. This is an entirely realistic way for a dragon to produce icy breath without metabolism or mechanical engineering issues. The only remaining issue is materials, which have always been a problem with fire-breathing dragons anyway. 

There would be little to no (unintended) effects on the system as a whole, assuming that you're thruster is a pure shkadov thruster and is being used to move the system in a direction rather than being used to affect the system. Taking the sun as an example (simply because its on wikipedia) "with luminosity 3.85 × 1026 W and mass 1.99 × 1030 kg, the total thrust produced by reflecting half of the solar output would be 1.28 × 1018 N. After a period of one million years this would yield an imparted speed of 20 m/s." Compare this with the earths orbital speed of 30000 m/s and you'll see there's nothing to worry about. A great deal of the imparted velocity will in fact simply be dissipated as tidal forces in the stars and planets. There may be more of a problem with further out icy bodies that orbit slower but even Pluto is about 4700 m/s and it'll be over millions of years so don't expect showers of comets destroying civilisation or anything. If on the other hand you put this thruster there specifically to wreck your own system. Yeah you can do some damage, slowing down the stars relative to each other, spinning them apart excreta. Though if you can make such a thruster you have much better ways to kill your entire species off than crashing your stars together over a billion years. 

The lowest density practical (excluding hydrogen and helium) liquid is liquid methane, with a density of about 0.65g/cm3 compared with water's 1g/cm3. There are few, if any, solids that will float in this unless they contain trapped gas. Ethane, propane and butane are not far behind. Steel ships float in water because they are mostly full of air. So your ship in a hydrocarbon ocean could be filled with atmosphere and float. Unless you have very high pressures. If you take liquid methane and seal it in a partially filled container, you will have methane liquid at the bottom and methane vapour above. Increase the temperature and the density of the liquid rises. The vapour pressure also rises, hence the vapour becomes more dense. Finally at −82.6 °C temperature and and 46 bar pressure (about 46 times earth atmosphere) the density of the gas and liquid phases becomes the same, and the two phases become indistinguishable. This is called the critical point. The critical point exists for pure liquids that are stable enough not to decompose before boiling. Ethane's is at 32C and 49 bar. So if you have a methane atmosphere over a methane ocean slightly below the critical point, it will not be practical to build a boat. The critical point temperature for ethane is more comfortable for humans, but the pressure is too much. 49 bar is equivalent to about 490m ocean depth on earth, but the record for scuba diving is 332m (short term.) Unfortunately these types of pressures are the only way to make the atmosphere dense enough that a boat filled with atmosphere would not float. The only way to have a gas much denser than ethane while retaining a low boiling point would be to consider a noble gas atmosphere (such as Krypton) over an ocean of hydrocarbon. Pressures would still need to be quite high but not as high as 49 bar. But the heavier noble gases are quite rare so the possibility of finding an entire atmosphere of heavy noble gas is zero unless artifically created by some former superadvanced alien's terraforming project. Making your balloon float is easy. Fill it with hydrogen or helium. A hydrogen filled balloon will not present a fire risk unless the atmosphere contains oxygen. 

my answers are for Neptune specifically, rather than for any liquid cored planet, though many principles used are generalise-able. on a "small scale": you would need to use robots to physically go down and collect the liquid in the core from the gaseous atmosphere. there are two approaches to this. firstly you can make a robot-plane able to go all the way from the 'surface' to the deep high pressure centre, alternatively a sort of relay system could be made so many robots pass the liquid between each other each staying within their own band of pressure and altitude with an internal pressure to match. the relay goes all the way from the bottom to the top though no one robot does. both are viable and doable, though I strongly recommend the second. on large scales: use a "centrifugal straw". the internal pressures in Neptune are a massive problem, however the temperatures are apparently not (being significantly under 5100k which while extremely hot is kind of workable with something like graphite since the high pressures raise the boiling point). back to pressure their is fortunately a way for a pipe to overcome arbitrarily high pressures. spinning the pipe (or rather an internal "support" in the walls of the pipe) will counter the inward force of the atmospheric pressure. since you can spin something arbitrarily quickly there is no theoretical limit to the pressure such a system can be built to withstand. the pipe could not be a suction pipe ($URL$ and would need to support its own weight using buoyancy. power would be provided from large solar arrays in orbit or at the surface. sadly the only information i could get on neptunes core temperature is this very uncited image that looks like its from 2003 but that being said I will still be using it on a very large scale: like eggs in a microwave! the core is big meaning it has a large volume to surface area ratio so if parts of it are heated they will keep that heat for a vary long time. so using an oscillating magnetic field, radiation or some kind of high pressure tolerance nuclear bombs dropped deep into the core you could heat the core up substantially. hot matter rises (admittedly you need to make it very hot if its going to rise through hydrogen and helium but its still doable especially given how cold neptunes atmosphere is) so large thermals of the core substances will start blooming in the atmosphere for 'easy mining'. odd but doable for any K1.(a bit) civilisation. on an absurdly large scale: just mine the whole planet layer by layer with a vast legion of robots until you reach the juicy core. I mean why not? you were probably going to be mining the outer layers anyway, right? 

As other answers have said, there is no evolutionary incentive for males to be intelligent, so evolution will reduce them to nothing more than horny little puppies. The issue then becomes how will a female who is ready to procreate identify a male with good genes? And the only answer that comes to mind is by looking at their mother. I see a situation where an existing women has a bunch of these horny mutts at home, and her friend comes round and decides to have a baby with one of them. She will give birth to a litter of males, and after several attempts, the female child she always wanted. Nature demands that there will be vastly more males than needed. This will lead to them being euthanised, as letting them go wild would create a problem similar to that of feral dogs (except that these would take leg humping to a new level.) It would be possible, but not necessarily the social norm, for two (or three or four) females to form a committed lesbian relationship and have children via each others male offspring. However if they were both virgins they would still need to lose their virginity with the male of a more experienced female in order to get started. And their offspring would always carry some of that experienced female's genes, so she might want to be part of their lives. Many species females have a naturally lower attraction for their relatives, to avoid incest. This is not so prevalent in males. Observation of the natural world shows horny, indiscriminate male monkeys trying to mate with close relatives and being rejected. On the other hand, the males of this species will need to clearly identify their mother as a provider and not a potential sex partner to avoid being thrown out of the brood for harrasing her. Ants and bees offer a relevant model. The sexual dimorphism of anglerfish (where the tiny male becomes a permanently attached sperm-producing parasite) is also of interest.
