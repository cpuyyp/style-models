According to the National Archives a 1780 survey showed that just 214,000 men had the vote in England and Wales (from a population of approximately 8 million - roughly 3%). 

So for 6 cattle this could mean anything from 840 to 4050 lbs of meat. If we assume a ration of a pound of meat a day, that would give a potential range of 33-162 days of meat from 6 animals depending upon their size and the skill of those extracting the available meat. 

According to Donald Featherstone's "The Bowmen of England" the longbow probably did arrive in England from Wales. 

The Regulations for the Army of the Confederate States, 1862, uses identical wording (page 405). Similarly, this book on the Uniform and Dress of the Army of the Confederate States printed in 1861, also uses the same wording to describe the belt buckle (which is matched in the illustrations of the uniforms). which suggests that if these "CS" buckles did exist, they were either not used on sword belts or they were non-regulation (at least between 1862-4). 

In contrast, the French took a different path with regard to their economy up to the Napoleonic period; 

Judging from the reference to Robert Hardy's book, I'm assuming that the bow in question is the longbow, so what follows is based on that... The Bow The longbow itself was usually made from a single piece of wood. This would have been 5-6 ft long with a maximum girth of 4-5in at the center. Typical draw-weights for a warbow, determined from examples found on the Mary Rose, appear to have been in the 90-140lbs range, so the bow would have had to have been fairly strong to tolerate that amount of force. If used in the manner of a staff or club, the body of the bow could have landed a serious clout. Using it in such a manner against an armored foe does, of course, increase the chance of damage to the weapon. The Bowman The typical English longbowman was a yeoman, a small land-owner or urban gentleman. Not a rich man but not the lowest of peasants either. His equipment would have reflected his position both as a land-owner and as a professional soldier. He would be lightly armored and would probably have a sword and/or a long dagger for self-defence. These melee weapons could be supplemented by the mauls and axes used to prepare stakes (for cavalry defence) and by weapons looted from the fallen men-at-arms around them. It wouldn't be unusual for an archer to carry a spare bow on campaign, in case his main weapon was broken. This second bow may also have been of a lighter pull for use at shorter ranges or later in the battle when the bowman's stamina was waning. The Battle While the typical image of the longbow in cinema is as a long range weapon, dropping a rain of arrows on their foes, it's clear from descriptions of battles that it was used as a short range weapon too. In fact, the longbow could only puncture plate armor at fairly short ranges (assuming a square hit and a bodkin arrowhead). A common tactic was to have the knights and men-at-arms in the center of the line with archers on each wing. As the enemy engaged the center, the wings would wrap around shooting into the sides of the enemy formation. In this situation, the bowmen might be shooting from as little as 5-10 yards. However, far more common that pitched open battles were seiges and raiding parties (chevauchée). In these situations, the archers were often directly exposed to the enemy troops, in ambush or assault. Archers also provided the artillery for naval vessels of the period. Archers would line the decks and vantage points, such as the forecastle and crows nest, to fire on the enemy. Once the ships closed, they would continue to shoot to prevent the enemy troops concentrating for a boarding action or to clear the enemy decks for a boarding action of their own. From this we can see that the archers bow was his main weapon of choice even down to short ranges. However, in the event of hand-to-hand combat, he would have had more suitable weapons available to him. Given the risk of damage to the bow, it's very unlikely that any archer would choose to use it as a club or staff when there were better options available. That said, there is always the possibility of an archer being taken by surprise by an enemy in battle. With no time to draw another weapon, he might well have had a swing with the bow in his hands, if only to buy time to draw his sword or dagger. Since it would have been a life or death, spur of the moment, action by a mere peasant, that kind of use would be unlikely to make it into the pages of the chronicles. 

According to the The San Francisco call., October 10, 1910, pg 3, the park is named after Núñez de Balboa. It states that at the park's dedication... 

So it was easy to manufacture and everyone knew how to use it. The difference was that the English recognised its potential and, thanks to repeated practice, could produce archers bending bows of far greater power than their opponents could manage. 

As the wikipedia article on consols mentions, Britain actually started issuing these perpetual bonds in 1751. So their use during the Napoleonic Wars some fifty or so years later was far from unprecedented. As noted in the comments, the attractiveness of this style of loan (to the borrower) was a combination of the low interest rate and putting the management of the loan in the hands of the borrower (who could decide if and when to pay off the debt). The latter was important because during the 18th Century Britain was frequently at war. A fixed-term loan always had the potential to fall due during a period of conflict when repaying (or refinancing) could have crippling consequences. In considering how and why Britain could manage to arrange these perpetual bonds, it's important to consider the role of the Bank of England. This institution had expanded to become, essentially, a part of the government of Britain. It was the Bank of England that performed the task of raising and paying the interest on government loans.

The Regulations for the Army of the Confederate States, 1864, in the section on uniforms states (on page 409) that: 

It goes on to say that the theoretical advantages of the 12-pdr were 'often negated by its slower rate of fire'. source: Napoleonic Artillery. A.L.Dawson, P.L.Dawson & S.Summerfield (Crowood Press, 2007) 

As a supplement to Schwern's answer, from Janet MacDonald's book on provisioning ships during the Napoleonic period 

Tackling the final one of your questions; i.e. why would they choose canvas over traditional wood? It seems that the main reason was one of portability. 

So ships that had could be genuinely be claimed to have continous active service running into decades are more likely to be larger vessels built in the nineteenth century. 

According to this book both Prince Albert and Prince Edward (who became King Edward VII) attended lectures by Faraday, but it seems to be Albert who was the real fan. 

The War of 1812 between Britain and America was very directly related to the Napoleonic Wars in Europe (which included the French invasion of Russia). 

The ongoing arms race in armored warfare between defensive measures and offensive weapons generally means that a given tank is able to resist the weapons of the previous generation and, in turn, be able to defeat the armor of the previous generation. In the 1991 Gulf War, while the coalition forces had the Abrams and Challenger MBTs (which were best-of-breed at the time), the Iraqi army was largely equiped with previous generation Chinese type-69 and Soviet T-55 and T-62 tanks. These export-market tanks also lacked the more sophisticated night-fighting and range-finding equipment found on the Soviet Army machines. The small numbers of newer T-72 tanks, which were in the possession of the Republican Guard, were also export models that lacked the explosive reactive armor of the Soviet models. Had they possessed this, they might have faired better. As a consequence, the Iraqis had to get lucky to get a kill, whereas the coalition tanks could destroy an opponent with almost any clean hit. Add to that the ability of the better trained coalitions crews to fire faster (and on the move) and the low morale of the Iraqi crews (who often abandoned their vehicles prior to being engaged) and the results don't seem so strange.
