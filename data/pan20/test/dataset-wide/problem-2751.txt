At least since David Hume, the father of the modern philosophical discussion of causality, it is customary to associate causality with contiguity in space and time, and with succession in time. Contiguity means not merely nearness, but a kind of continuity. Immediate (or "proximate") cause and effect are supposed not only to be near to actually touch each other. For example, it is not enough that the light switch is near the bulb. A continuous electrical circuit must be connecting them. In such ways, mediate cause and effect are supposed to be connected by a chain of immediate causes and effects, such that each successive cause/effect pair are contiguous. Succession in time means that the cause is supposed to precede the effect, in time. Such as pressing the light switch precedes (if only by very little) the appearance of the light. You can read about all that in David Hume's Treatise on Human Nature, in the section Of the Idea of Cause and Effect. 

But there is no need to "add" the attribute of being a trinity to God, if God already possesses this attribute. The ontological argument is silent about which are the perfections that God possesses, except about one perfection: existence. One option is that God possesses trinity-being accidentally, not even as a perfection. Another option is that trinity-being is a perfection. Would this last option be a problem? One might say that being-trinity is a "complication", that it is "not simple", etc. But is it? One might compare God to a perfect circle, or a perfect sphere. But this last analogy seems stretched, because God is not a geometrical figure. He is, rather, a god. So the relevant question would be what would a simple god (and not a simple geometrical shape) be like? And there are already many "complications" about god without the trinity, such as: how can a god be angry, of content? How can he possess a will? And many others. So that being-trinity is just one more complication among many. And if you believe, like a christian, that it is an unavoidable complication, then it doesn't conflict with the maximum simplicity that a god can have. Furthermore, it does not seem to me apt to associate the simplicity of God specifically with the ontological argument. The ontological argument depicts God as a multiplicity, not as a unity. The argument speaks on many perfections. It speaks about God having all the perfections. It deals with many, different, perfections, and not with one, simple, perfection. So there is no apparent connection between the ontological argument, specifically, and the supposed simplicity of God. 

That he wasn't mad was not a conclusion of any argument or proof of Descartes's. It was just a necessary methodological assumption, without which his enterprise would have lost its point. Descartes's meditations were meant for normal and intelligent adults. He had little concern with those outside this sphere. Feral children were therefore largely beyond the scope of his work... 

Putnam, partly by intention, began his argument with a hazy notion of 'meaning'. The stated goal of his famous essay ("the meaning of meaning" (1975)) was to offer a new account of meaning. Part of that haziness was in the notion of intension. Putnam introduced the distinction between extension and intension through this example: the expressions "creature with heart" and "creature with kidney" have the same extension, yet they differ in "meaning", in some sense of that term. The sense of "meaning" in which the two expressions differ, we call 'intension'. Later, Putnam mentions the view, that intension determines extension,  as a "traditional doctrine", without offering any rationale for this view. On the other hand he states that "no one has ever offered" that intension determines extension for indexicals (as  mentioned in the question). These two statements seem to be in conflict. If there is a general, principled doctrine that intension determines extension, how can there be exceptions, like indexicals? Putnam did not engage this problem. Putnam did make clear, however, in what way natural-kind terms (like water, gold, elm, beech; those that are involved in the "twin earth" thought experiments) are relevantly different than indexicals. The "twin earth" cases demonstrate, according to Putnam, a social aspect in natural-kind terms, that does not exist in indexicals. For example, the meaning of 'gold' for me includes the chemical structure of gold, even though I don't know what that structure is. And at least part of the explanation is that I trust that someones in my larger community, the experts, do know the chemical structure of gold. This could be taken to also justify Putnam's choice, that with regard to natural-kind terms, meaning (intension) does determine extension. For indexicals it seems that what is "in the head" is insufficient to determine the extension. For natural-kind terms, on the other hand, even though nothing in my head determines then extension, something in someone else's head (the relevant expert) does determine the extension. This seems to give a reason to identify the meaning of my words, not with the contents of my head, but with the content of someone else's head (the expert), which does determine the extension. Putnam did not take this line of justification, however, for the position that meaning determines extension, for natural-kind terms. Like before, he abstained from providing any principled reasons why meaning should determine extension. Instead, he simply appealed to what he took to be the common use of the word 'meaning': 

I think that there is no clearly superior answer, as to whether e.g. the pebble category is abstract. Both answers, yes or no, have some plausible support. On the one hand, one may hold that only particular entities (e.g. particular pebbles) exist, and the category is merely a more or less rough similarity that we abstract from the particulars. Hence, that the category is abstract. On the other hand, one may hold that there is something common to particular pebbles, the essence of pebbles, which we may call e.g. ‘pebblehood’. And that pebblehood is in particular pebbles, a constitutive part of pebbles. We talk similarly about the humanity inside particular human beings. And in this case, the category denotes the essence, something that actually exists inside every particular of a given kind. And to this extent it is concrete, not abstract. 

According to Wittgenstein, what we cannot speak about cannot be defined clearly (hence, cannot be defined at all). Because if it could be defined clearly, it could ipso facto be spoken about. What cannot be spoken about can only be shown, and even that only indirectly, by showing what can be spoken about. 

So yes, some "assumptions" seem to be inevitable. But these assumptions seem to be inevitable even for a radical skeptic. And to that extent they seem to be less of a problem. 

And nothing is rationally implied about what will happen in the future. In particular, the possibility that the past nourishing bread will turn into a poisonous one cannot be ruled out. A consideration of causes cannot be used to argue against Hume, because Hume's thesis includes a related criticism against the very idea of cause. The most we can tell about causes, according to Hume, is that events of one type were consistently followed by events of another type - until now. Again we cannot, according to Hume, rationally assert anything about causal relations continuing to hold in the future. So nothing about causes, as well, would preclude the possibility that a nourishing bread will turn just like that into a poisonous one. 

Yes, but the satisfaction is not external to the search. Therefore, when the search points to the satisfaction, it does not point beyond itself. The feeling of satisfaction is, according to Aristotle, something that naturally accompanies the activity, the search for explanation, when it is done well. The satisfaction cannot be separated from the search. One could not get that satisfaction by other means (say, drugs) thus bypassing the satisfaction's natural cause, the search for explanation. There are different kinds of satisfaction, which correspond to the different kinds of activity. As Aristotle says in the Ethics, regarding pleasures: 

b does not exist (at some time), and b exists (at another time) are both true. Which contradicts (2.) 

I don't think that Wittgenstein actually "rigged" his argument from the start by limiting the meaningfulness of propositions to only matters of phenomenal fact. Because first, the Tractatus actually never mentions phenomenal facts, neither at the start, nor at the end. Second, the Tractatus, more generally, does not discuss epistemology at all. Third, in many comments Wittgenstein does oppose natural science to philosophy. But such remarks start relatively late in the book, in part 4. So it does not seem to be rigged from the start (more about this immediately). 

Second, Quine's criticism of the analytic / synthetic distinction does not seem to me to touch Popper's formulation. Quine's argument amounts to the result, that a statement that seems synthetically true today may seem analytically true tomorrow, and false next week. But since Popper's formulation covers all the analytic / synthetic combinations, it wouldn't matter for the argument if the principle of induction changes between analytic and synthetic, as Quine allows. Therefore, to the extent that Popper's formulation was valid before, it is still valid. 

(I don't see how the alternative translation "pettifogger" can account for these forceful phrases) The immediate context of the word "informer" seems to be, that Thrasymachus suddenly realizes that Socrates is interpreting him uncharitably. Instead of interpreting him in a way that will make his assertions truthful and apt, Socrates explicitly prefers to attribute to Thrasymachus an inferior view that will make him open to attack. Socrates is thus revealed as not the friendly partner that he pretended to be. 

Descartes had little interest in cases of abnormal psychology. To take an example, at the outset of his long argument in the Meditations, he declared unhesitatingly that he wasn't mad. 

Hegel uses the expression "speculative thinking" in a positive sense. It is the kind of thinking that he supposedly exemplifies in his own work, a thinking that bridges all the gaps until every item is necessarily connected and explained. 

To generate accurate predictions, is a basic demand from scientific hypotheses. But it has no specific relation to causation. Therefore it does not relate to the question, as to the gap between causation and correlation. It isn't clear whether an "underlying mechanism" is the best way to fill the gap between correlation and causation. What could such a mechanism be? For one thing, it cannot be a causal mechanism, for this would just push the question back instead of answering it. Anyway, the consideration of accurate prediction is unrelated to this issue. 

You might be pulling Wittgenstein's words out of context. Wittgenstein is not concerned (in PI 109) with the general use of descriptions and explanations, but only with their use in doing philosophy. Again, Wittgenstein does not refer to the ordinary, professional or scientific use of descriptions and explanations, but only to their use in philosophy. 

That is, a condensed body, though smaller in spatial extension, is not smaller in (material) extension. Which implies that (material) extension for Descartes is not simply identical with spatial, geometrical extension. It is not simply identical with the space that the body occupies. 

A statement p is more general than statement q if p pertains to more instances than q (i.e. when all the instances of q are instances of p, but not vice versa). A statement p is universal if it does not contain any references to particular objects, times, places etc. And so 

The Matrix is surely more Platonic than Aristotelian. In general, Plato believed that reality could turn out very different than what it seemed to be at the time. Aristotle believed that reality was, by and large, similar to what it seemed to be at the time. Plato believed that only few human beings could free themselves sufficiently and see the truth. Aristotle believed that this ability was much more commom. The later Plato was even more skeptical than the earlier Plato. Also Plato's academy became, after his death, disposed to radical skepticism. The fact that Aristotle's four causes are applicable to the Matrix is inconsequential here. The four causes are applicable both in and out of the Matrix, so that they are not evidence for either possibility. 

The materials in the site to which you referred ($URL$ seem to be based on objectivism, the philosophical system of the writer Ayn Rand. The quote on the home page is taken from Rand's essay Philosophy:  Who Needs It.  In objectivism, the term integration refers to the formation of concepts. In a word, one forms concepts by grouping together (=integrating) similar percepts (perceptual data) and/or previously formed concepts. Rand believed that a correct method of concept-formation (=integration) was crucial to every individual human being, in order to avoid false and disastrous ideologies, like (by her) religion,  marxism, fascism. See the entry in the Ayn Rand Lexicon for some more details.  

The self exists only as an external "limit" of the linguistically constructed world. (Perhaps akin to Kant's Transcendental Subject) 

So yes, Gödel's incompleteness theorem was a serious problem for the Logical Positivists. It was one of several nails in the coffin that gradually closed upon LP.. 

Yes, from the context of Quine's remarks in Two Dogmas of Empiricism it seems clear that Quine thought then positing the Homeric Gods had some predictive power. It's difficult to say exactly why, because Quine did not elaborate on the Homeric Gods anywhere else, afaik. Pure fiction is irrelevant here. Quine's essay is about real beliefs, within an empiricist framework. He does not touch pure fiction in this essay. So, the Homeric Gods are surely meant as real empirical posits, not as pure fiction. 

Another place where we should have expected Descartes to present his views on biological species, if he had any, is in the Principles, where Descartes laid out the principles of science, based upon his epistemological and metaphysical foundations. Descartes did present, in fact, a foundation for physics, but much less for biology. And he tells us, in fact, that he planned to dedicate two additional parts of the Principles to living beings: plants, animals and human life. This plan, however, did not actualize. According to Descartes himself, he did not feel ready for it. 

We begin with the intension, which is a property, or type, and derive from it the class, the extension. 

I can try a (more or less) intelligent guess.. First, Anaximander's theory is counter - observational because there are no similar observations (of a static body suspended in mid air) here on earth. The sun and the moon are weak counter examples because (1) we (as ancients) do not know whether they are suspended in mid air or not. It's a matter of another cosmological theory or speculation, beside the question about the position of the earth. Furthermore (2) we (as ancients) usually believe that the whole sky revolves around the earth, and this does not seem consistent with the sun and the moon being just suspended in mid air. It would seem to us more likely that they are fixed on transparent spheres.. Second, saying thst Anaximander's theory is highly intuitive seems to be a praise for the theory. It seems to mean that (1) the theory is imaginative; that (2) it prima facie succeeds in explaining what it was supposed to explain; and that (3) it respects some important constraints, such that it does not involve any reference to gods, or other intentional beings.
