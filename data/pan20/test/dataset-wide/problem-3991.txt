Let $k$ be field and let $m > 2$. Let $R = k[t_1, t_1^{-1}, \dots, t_m, t_m^{-1}]$. Then $R$ is not a $GE_2$-ring [4] (although $SK_1(R) = 1$ by Suslin's Stability Theorem [6, Theorem 5.8]), so that $T$ is not a $GE_2$-ring. Below lie the remains of my first (overly complicated) answer. it has been groomed so as to address the Euclidean case $m = 1$. 

The rank of $\ker f$ is $n - k$ where $k$ is the free rank of $f(\mathbb{Z}^n)$. The following remark splits the computation of $k$ into two parts; the first can be effectively carried out provided that each norm $N_{K/\mathbb{Q}}(\lambda_i)$ is known: 

The proof is a straightforward generalization of the classical pigeonhole argument for finite covers of vector spaces, see the Corollary below. If $R$ is a commutative ring with identity which has a finite residue field $k$, then any vector space over $k$ with finite dimension $ > 1$ is an $R$-module that can be covered by finitely many (proper) lines. OP's second question is therefore addressed by 

The first method mimics YCor's but uses the theory of right-angled Artin groups (aka partially commutative groups, or graph groups) instead of Bass-Serre theory. The second is prompted by YCor's proof and consists in the computation of the cohomological dimension of $G_n$ which turns out to be $n + 1$. These two methods enable us to retrieve YCor's stronger statement 

For $G(R) = SL_n(R)$ (see, e.g., this MO post) or $G(R) = Sp_{2n}(R)$, there is a common line of reasoning in order to prove that the reduction modulo $\mathfrak{a}$, say $\varphi_{\mathfrak{a}}: G(R) \rightarrow G(R/\mathfrak{a})$, is surjective. It consists in showing that $G(R/\mathfrak{a})$ is generated by elementary matrices any of which has a lift in $G(R)$. For $SL_n(R)$, these elementary matrices are $E_{ij}(r) = 1_n + re_{ij}$ with $1 \le i \neq j \le n$ and where $1_n$ is the $n$-by-$n$ identity matrix and $e_{ij}$ differs from the zero matrix only by its $(i, j)$ entry, which is $r \in R$. For $Sp_{2n}(R)$, these elementary matrices are $ SE_{ij}(r) = \left\{ \begin{array}{ccc} 1_{2n} + re_{ij} & \text{ if } i = j',\\ 1_{2n} + re_{ij} - (-1)^{i + j}re_{j'i'} & \text{otherwise}. \end{array}\right. $ with $1 \le i \neq j \le n$ and where $i \mapsto i'$ is the permutation of $\mathbb{N}$ defined by $(2i)' = 2i - 1$ and $(2i - 1)' = 2i$; alternatively, this is the infinite product of transpositions $(12)(34)(56) \cdots$. If $SL_n(R)$ is generated by the matrices $E_{ij}(r)$ with $r \in R$, the ring $R$ is said to be $GE_n$-ring in P. M. Cohn's terminology [1]. There are many examples of rings which are, or which are not $GE_n$-rings, see [1, 3] or this MO post. I don't know about the terminology for $Sp_{2n}(R)$, but here is a claim which addresses both groups. 

[1] "Elementary divisors and modules", I. Kaplansky, 1949 (MR0031470). [2] "On the structure of principal ideal rings", T. W. Hungerford, 1968 (MR0227159). [3] "Serre's problem on projective modules", T. Y. Lam, 2006 (MR2235330). 

An integral domain $R$ such that every proper non-zero $R$-submodule of $\text{Frac}(R)$ is projective is a local principal ideal ring. (The converse is David Handelman's comment above). Indeed, we have 

If $q = \frac{a}{b}$, then $\mathfrak{d} = \frac{1}{a}(Ra \cap Rb)$. Thus the ideal of denominators of $q$ is principal if and only $Ra \cap Rb$ is principal, that is $\text{lcm}(a,b)$ exists. In this case, we know that $\text{gcd}(a, b)$ exists and is such that $\text{lcm}(a,b)\text{gcd}(a, b) = ab$ up to multiplication by a unit. 

Addendum. As observed by Keith Kearnes in the comments below, the lattice $L$ is isomorphic to the lattice of two-sided ideals in a finite non-commutative ring. 

A principal ideal ring (PIR) is a ring whose ideals are principal, equivalently a PIR is a Noetherian Bézout ring. The aforementioned general result follows from the existence and uniqueness of the invariant factor decomposition of Noetherian elementary divisor rings see [Theorems 9.1 and 9.3, 1]. The fact that a PIR is an elementary divisor ring in the sense of I. Kaplansky is a consequence of [Theorem 1, 2]. This is stated without proof in [Notes on Chapter I, 3]. By the way, it is rather unfair to allude to Zariski-Samuel's structure theorem (as T. W. Hungerford in [2] and subsequently in the wikipedia article on PIRs) when quoting the result about PIR decomposition in direct sum of domains and Artinian local rings. Indeed, this theorem was originally proved by W. Krull in 1924 and reproved by I. Kaplansky in 1949, cf. [Theorem 12.3, 1] and related comments therein. 

Edit. The following lines aim at comparing P. M. Cohn's example with those presented by მამუკა ჯიბლაძე in his answer. Here is a first remark which applies to both examples of PIDs. Because the Bass stable rank of $R$ is at most $2$ (use Bass Cancellation Theorem), it easily follows that any $1$-by-$n$ matrix over $R$ with $n \ge 3$ can be reduced to a matrix of the form $(*, \, 0, \dots,\,0)$ using elementary transformations. This certainly contrasts with the above example of $1$-by-$2$ matrix. This second remark only holds for P. M. Cohn's example. Let $E_n(R)$ denote the subgroup of $SL_n(R)$ generated the elementary matrices over $R$, i.e., those matrices which differ from the identity by a single off-diagonal entry. Then we observe that $SL_n(R)/E_n(R) \simeq SK_1(R)$ for every $n \ge 3$ by the classical stability theorems [2, Corollary 11.19] and $SK_1(R) = 1$ by the Bass-Milnor-Serre Theorem [2, Theorem 11.33]. For P. M. Cohn's matrix [1, Theorem 6.1], from which we borrowed the first row, this means that $\begin{pmatrix} 3 - \theta & 2 + \theta \\ - 3 - 2\theta & 5 - 2\theta \end{pmatrix} \in E_3(R) \setminus E_2(R)$. Eventually, in the case of the D. Grayson's PID, i.e., $R = S^{-1} \mathbb{Z}[T]$, with $S$ the multiplicative subset generated by $T$ and the polynomials $T^m - 1$, one can find $A \in SL_2(R)$ such that $A \notin E_n(R)$ for every $n \ge 2$ (I am unable to provide an explicit matrix at the moment). 

Proof. In the exact sequence [3, Theorem 13.20 and Example 13.22] $$K_2(S/J) \rightarrow SK_1(S, J) \rightarrow SK_1(S) \rightarrow SK_1(S/J)$$ the last term, namely $SK_1(S/J)$, is trivial since $S/J$ is Artinian and hence of stable range $1$. In addition, the image of $K_2(S/J)$ in $SK_1(S, J)$ is also trivial. Indeed $K_2(S/J)$ is generated by the Steinberg symbol $\{-1 + J, -1 + J\}_{S/J}$ because $S/J\simeq \mathbf{Z}/n \mathbf{Z}$ [3, Exercises 13A.10 and 15C.10]. As $\{-1, -1\}_S$ is a lift of the previous symbol in $K_2(S)$ our claim follows and the proof is now complete. By the previous lemma we have $SK_1(A) = SK_1(A, I)$. Since the inclusion $A \subset R$ induces an epimorphism from $SK_1(A, I)$ onto $SK_1(R, I)$, we deduce that $SK_1(A) \neq 1$. It is actually possible to find a non-trivial element in $SK_1(A)$ by considering the power residue symbol $\binom{12}{1 + 4i}_2 = -1$ [2, Section 11C]. This yields an non-trivial Mennicke symbol $[12, 1 + 4i]$ and eventually the non-reducible row $(12, 1 + X, X^2 + 16)$ using the ring epimorphism induced by $X \mapsto 4i$. Erratum. I claimed erroneously in former versions of this answer that the same technique easily applies to $\mathbb{Z}[X^{\pm 1}]$. My conclusions were wrong and I fail to answer the following 

I would like to contribute in outlining two natural generalizations of the original question for which the Jacobson radical also comes into play. Eventually, I would like to quote two research results for which OP’s question is essential. Considering that $R^{\times} = GL_1(R)$, it is natural to ask "When does the surjection $R \twoheadrightarrow R/I$ induce a surjective map $GL_n(R) \rightarrow GL_n(R/I)$?". Here $I$ is an ideal of $R$ and the second map is the reduction of matrix coefficients modulo $I$. If $I$ is an ideal contained in the Jacobson radical $\text{rad}(R)$ of $R$, then $GL_n(R) \rightarrow GL_n(R/I)$ is surjective [4, Exercise I.1.12.iv]. Considering that $R$ is an $R$-module and that every element in $R^{\times}$ generates $R$, it is natural to ask "For $M$ an $R$-module, when do $R$-generating sets of $M/IM$ lift to $R$-generating sets of $M$?". This holds if $I \subset \text{rad}(R)$ and $M/IM$ is finitely generated over $R$ by Nakayama’s lemma (see also the related concept of superfluous submodule). I introduce now a result published in 2003 which directly relates to OP's question. Let $R$ be a Dedekind domain which is universal for $GE_2$. The latter property means that in the subgroup $GE_2(R) \subset GL_2(R)$ generated by the transvections and the diagonal matrices, the latter generators are only subject to the « obvious » or universal relations (equivalently $K_2(2, R)$ is generated by symbols as a normal subgroup of $St_2(2, R)$ [1, 3]). Then we have: 

Since $\text{cd}(H) \le \text{cd}(G)$ whenever $H$ is a subgroup of $G$ [Proposition VIII.2.4, 3], it follows from Claim 2 that $a(G_n) = n + 1$. Let $F(a, b)$ the free group over the alphabet $\{a,b\}$ and let $r_i = [a^{-i}ba^i, b] \in F(a,b)$. We denote by $R_n$ the normal subgroup of $F(a, b)$ generated by $r_1, \dots, r_n$. By Hopf's theorem [Theorem II.5.3, 3], we have $$\text{H}_2(G_n, \mathbb{Z}) \simeq \frac{ R_n}{[F(a,b), R_n]}$$ 

The answer to your initial question is yes, and Igor Rivin's comment is right and good. The result follows from the fact that a commutative PIR (Principal Ideal Ring) with identity is a Hermite ring in the sense of I. Kaplansky. Indeed, a Hermite ring possesses a trigonal reduction as required, cf. [1, Theorem 3.5]. The fact that a commutative PIR with identity is a Hermite ring can be deduced from Hungerford's theorem [Theorem 1, 3] for instance (quotients and direct products of a Hermite rings are still Hermite). A PIR is actually an elementary divisor ring in the sense of I. Kaplansky (still a consequence of [Theorem 1, 3]), which is even stronger as it enjoys diagonal reduction. This is stated without proof in [Notes on Chapter I, 4]. Regarding rschwieb's answer, this approach fails already for a PID (Principal Ideal Domain) if you restrict to elementary row reduction. Indeed, you cannot row-reduce every $2$-by-$1$ matrices with coefficients in $R = \mathbf{Z}[\frac{1 + \sqrt{-19}}{2}]$ to a trigonal form $\begin{pmatrix}* \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}$, since otherwise $R$ would be a $GE$-ring in the sense of P. M. Cohn and it isn't [2, Introduction and Theorem 6.1]. Still, the approach is successful for a Euclidean ring $R$, as we have $SL_n(R) = E_n(R)$ in this case. Here $E_n(R)$ denotes the group generated by the elementary matrices, i.e., those matrices which induce the elementary row reduction moves preserving the determinant. Thus row reduction, i.e., multiplication on the left by elementary matrices, is not sufficient to reduce a matrix to a trigonal form in a PID. However, reduction to a trigonal form is always achievable in PIDs if you allow multiplication by any invertible matrix on the left, which is your original problem. This is a subpart of the Smith Normal Form Theorem, the result rightly referred to by rschwieb and Igor Rivin. It is presented in some classical text books, e.g., "Abstract Algebra" of D. S. Dummit and R. M. Foote, which also handles Dedekind domains. Other readers may point you to sources of a more algorithmic nature; the Euclidean case is advisable as it is algorithmic by nature and far less technical than the PID case. I found the wiki page on the Smith normal Form pretty good algorithm-wise. It goes into the detail of not-so-trivial induction arguments based on the number of prime divisors of coefficients, something that is missing in the outline of rschwieb. (You'll see there that the matrix $L_0 \in SL_2(R)$ used in step II is not necessarily an elementary matrix). The most general class of rings with reduction to a trigonal form is, by definition, the class of Hermite rings in the sense of Kaplansky. For a modern treatment see [4], where the author refers to K-Hermite rings. As stated above, this class includes PIRs. In my humble opinion, the issue with zero divisors was not a minor one.

In particular, we have $S_R = R^{\times}$ for any regular local domain $R$ which is not a principal ideal domain. We also obtain 

The proof of Fedja's Lemma can be reduced to the case $n = 1$. The proof of the case $n = 1$ is eased off by 

The Bass-Milnor-Serre theorem [3, Theorem 11.33] is key to understand step (1): let $F$ be a totally imaginary number field and $m$ is the number of elements of finite order in $F^{\ast}$. For each ideal $I$ in the ring of integers $R$ of $F$, the relative special Whitehead group $SK_1(R, I)$ is a cyclic group of finite order $r$. For each prime $p$, $\text{ord}_p(r)$ is the nearest integer in the interval $\lbrack 0, \text{ord}_p(m) \rbrack$ to $$\min_{\mathfrak{p}} \left\lfloor \frac{\nu_{\mathfrak{p}}(I)}{\nu_{\mathfrak{p}}(pR)} - \frac{1}{p - 1} \right\rfloor$$ where $\lfloor x \rfloor$ denotes the greatest integer $\le x$ and $\mathfrak{p}$ ranges over the prime ideals of $R$ containing $p$. Independently of the above theorem, it follows from [1, Corollary 5.2] that $SK_1(R, I)$ surjects onto $SK_1(R, J)$ if $I \subset J$ and $R/I$ is semi-local. For $R$ and $I$ as in the theorem, the group $SK_1(R, I)$ increases in size as $I$ decreases with respect to inclusion. This is reflected in the above formula and it is immediate to see that for every decreasing sequence of ideals $I$, the corresponding sequence $(SK_1(R, I))_I$ stabilizes. Moreover, we can find $I$ such that $SK_1(R, I)$ has the maximal cardinality $m$ and $I$ is then small enough in the sense that any ideal contained in $I$ yields the same maximal $SK_1$ group. We are now (almost) in position to provide an order $A$ in some $R$ as above such that $\mathbf{Z}[X]$ surjects onto $A$ and $SK_1(A)$ is not trivial. Indeed, consider $R = \mathbf{Z}[i]$, the Gaussian integers, set $A = \mathbb{Z} + 4i \mathbb{Z}$ and $I = 4 \mathbf{Z}[i]$ (this $I$ is sufficiently small for our purpose, but doesn't maximize $SK_1$, unlike $8 \mathbf{Z}[i]$). We will establish that $SK_1(A)$ surjects onto $SK_1(R, I) \simeq \mathbf{Z}/2\mathbf{Z}$, the latter isomorphism being given by Bass-Milnor-Serre's theorem. To do so, let us prove the following lemma:
