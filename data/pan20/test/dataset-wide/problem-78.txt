As others have noted, Britain doesn't have a formal Constitution, so the government can be changed through acts of Parliament. For most countries, it would require amending the Constitution, but again, most if not all constitutions have some legal procedure for amending them. You face the far more difficult practical problem of how you would get such changes passed. To make a story plausible, you can't just say that one day someone came along and proposed totally re-organizing the government and Parliament passed this and it was done. Real life doesn't happen that way. Any change requires that you get powerful groups and institutions on your side. To do it legally usually requires that you get some important elites on your side: one or more major political parties, the media, the schools, major businesses, etc. You don't necessarily need the majority of the people but it helps to have at least a substantial minority. Having the police and/or the military or other people with guns is also helpful. Radical change is usually best done in small steps. If you announce tomorrow that everyone is to be rounded up and taken to slave labor camps, people are likely to rebel. But if you announce that you are taking away one small freedom, most people will say, I don't like it but it's not worth fighting over. Then take away another, and a few months or years later another. Avoid doing something that will destroy many people's lives all at once. You want people to think that they have too much to lose to risk opposing the government on this. And of course, you don't publicly say, "Our plan is to take away everyone's rights and turn the country into a dictatorship." You say, "We are facing this extreme crisis and so we are calling for these temporary emergency measures until the crisis is over." Or, "We have no choice but to do this extreme thing because our enemies are trying to destroy us and this is the only way to fight back." Or, "Extreme? How are we being extreme? This is plain common sense." Etc. 

I don't see why not. To someone 100 or 200 years ago, our world is "futuristic". But we still have a lot of medieval architecture. (a) People may value old buildings because they respect their history. (b) People may build new buildings in an old style because they think it's pretty, if absolutely no other reason. There are times when functionality wins over fashion. Few modern Americans or Europeans would live in a mud hut, no matter how pretty or quaint they thought they looked, because it would be too uncomfortable. But I don't have a hard time imagining a fad where people become fascinated by mud huts, and have houses built that look like mud huts, though they are really made of more modern materials, have electricty and internet connections inside, etc. The army is not going to build medieval-style castles to defend the border in an era of tanks and jet aircraft. But a military academy might well be built to resemble a medieval castle. Lots of colleges and government buildings are made to look somewhat like ancient Greek and Roman buildings. Etc. 

Even if new people stopped being born, there are already 7 billion people in the world. So if he can push the button twice a second, and he does this non-stop 24 hours a day, seven days a week, it would still take him 111 years to kill everyone in the world. And as @sewack points out, he probably couldn't even keep up with new births. So he has no alternative but to build more boxes and either have accomplices in this scheme who will bush the buttons or have robots or something to push the buttons. How long does it take to build another box? If it takes 200 years of continuous work, then he's better off to just keep pushing the button. If he can build a box in an hour, it would make sense to recruit a bunch of people, and either build boxes for them all, or set some of them to building boxes while others push buttons.

Let's back up a step. What is "scripture"? Speaking primarily from a Christian point of view, "scripture" is the message that we believe was given to us by God and that we view as authoritative to define our religion. I think many other religions would say similar things, but not all. Some religions don't really have a body of writing that they view as authoritative. But using that definition ... Religions throughout history have used media other than text. Many or most religions have created music, sculpture, painting, architecture, and theater. But I don't know of any religion that says that these non-text media are part of their "scripture" per se. That is, Jews and Christians and Muslims and others write songs or paint paintings to portray things from their scriptures or to celebrate their faith, but they don't view these as authoritative. If two Christians had a disagreement about who was present at some event discussed in the Bible, they might carefully study the text of the Bible to find their answer. But they wouldn't look to a painting of the scene or a play about the event. That wouldn't be considered authoritative, just the theory or interpretation of the person who produced that media. Likewise, religious groups in countries with modern technology routinely use radio, TV, movies, and the Internet. But these are not viewed as scripture. That said, I find it is easy to imagine a future religion considering a video of a sermon by their founder as scripture. Why not? As a Christian, I believe that God revealed things to people over the course of several thousand years, and those revelations have been collected into the Bible. Why could he not reveal further things at some time in the future? If he did, I don't see why he couldn't use movies or streaming video. (Some Christians say the Bible is now "closed" and so there will be no future revelation, but that's an entirely different question that I don't want to get into here.) "Sacred computer code" is a bit of a stretch. What would it do? Sacred accounting software? A sacred video game? A program that tracks your sins in a database? But maybe I'm just not being imaginative enough. 

I presume you would see a variety of responses. People react differently. Responses would likely include: (a) Denial. Some people would refuse to believe that anything bad is about to happen. After all, we've already had hundreds of warnings that the world is going to be destroyed: year 2000, Mayan calendar, predictions of ecological disaster, predictions that global warming would destroy all life, nuclear war, etc. Most such warning have come and gone with nothing noticeable happening at all. Many rational people would say that this, too, is probably a false alarm. And don't say that you'd show them the irrefutable scientific proof: they heard that there was irrefutable proof for all the previous warnings, too. (b) Despair. People will decide to just get drunk or high until it's all over. The suicide rate will go up. People will lay down on their sofas and stare at the ceiling for days. Etc. (c) Desperation. (I didn't start out trying to make an alliteration but so far these all start with "D". Hmm.) No matter how impossible you say it is for anyone to survive, people will still try. There will be efforts to destroy or divert the object. People will build underground shelters. Etc. (d) Religious revival. (Arggh, broke the "D" pattern!) People who are faced with imminent death often suddenly have an interest in God and the afterlife. If everyone is faced with imminent death, I'd expect there to be religious revivals worldwide. (e) Preserve. Even if it's not possible to save all humanity, it would surely be possible to save a small number. 500-whatever days should be enough time for a crash program to build a ship that could carry at least a handful of people to Mars or wherever so that the human race would have a chance to survive even if 99+% die. Or maybe it's possible to build some sort of shelter on Earth that will preserve at least a few. (f) Legacy. I expect some people would try to leave behind some sort of legacy. Like try to collect all human knowledge, put it on a space probe and launch it into space. Like Voyager-Plus. Or do something to preserve it through the catastrophe, bury it deep in the ground or whatever. (g) Carry on. Some will try to get as much joy out of life as they can. People will do things they always wanted to do but never got around to. Marry that guy or girl. Go on that world tour. Write that novel. (h) Destroy. (There, another "D".) Some will vent their fear and frustration in pointless acts of anger. These will range from graffiti to riots that burn down cities. I suspect enough people would react this way that governments will have a hard time keeping order, especially in the big cities. I don't know how many people would fall into each group, but I think all of these would be represented. 

In one sense, I'd say this question is easy to answer, because there is a very close analogy in real life: harvesting organs from the dead for transplant. The difference between a mystical "life energy" and a more tangible organ would, I don't think, make any difference to the social and ethical issues involved. So, issues that people would surely think about and debate would include: Does a person have to give his consent for his life energy to be harvested? Or does the good to society outweigh the person's right to deny this benefit to others? People might be encouraged to commit suicide so that their life energy can be harvested. It would likely start out with euthanasia for the old, crippled, etc, and spread from there. The age at which a person is judged to be "old and useless" might ratchet downward, and the range of illnesses and infirmities judged sufficiently serious to justify euthanasia could grow. Sooner or later it would occur to someone to say that person A should be killed so that his life energy can be used to benefit person B. That could be because person A is a violent criminal who deserves to die anyway, or is a member of a racial minority or some other disliked group whose life is not as valuable as person B's, etc. Even if it's not legal, the rich and powerful might arrange for certain people to die "accidental" deaths so their life energy can be harvested. The more useful this life energy is, the more pointed the tough questions would become. If taking a swig of someone's life energy can cure an otherwise horrible disease or add years to a person's life or give him incredible energy, I'd expect people would find more excuses to take someone else's life energy. If it's some minor benefit, gives you a small extra burst of energy that can help out in athletic competitions or combat, probably less of an issue, though certainly it would still be there for the very selfish. There would also be what seems to me an obvious theological question: What is the relationship between this life energy and a person's soul? By capturing his life energy, are we capturing his soul, and preventing him from going to Heaven or being reincarnated or whatever the people of this society believes happens to the soul after death? Addendum Many years ago, when they first started putting consent for organ donations on the back of drivers licenses, my father said that he would never sign such a thing because some rich and powerful person who needs a transplant might arrange to have him killed so he could get his organs. At the time I thought he was being paranoid. Since then I've attended lectures by doctors and medical ethicists who say that the criteria for declaring someone "legally dead" have been steadily made looser over the years, and one of the stated reasons for doing this is so that organs can be harvested sooner. Of course they don't say, "yes, we know this person is still alive but we're going to declare him dead so we can harvest his organs". They say something more like, "we must balance the remote possibility that this person might recover against the benefits of harvesting his organs now before they begin to fail and become useless for transplant". Every now and then you hear of someone being declared "brain dead" and then they wake up and completely recover. Etc. So it's possible that in such a society, the push to kill people so their life energy can be harvested might be blatant: "This worthless criminal must be sacrificed so that our exalted king can be saved". Or it could be very subtle: "Well, sure, in the past we would have continued to care for this person in the hope that he would recover. But we must balance, etc." Oh, and it's quite possible that they wouldn't say, "We're going to kill this person to harvest his life energy." People who kill others for their own benefit rarely say, "We murdered this person because it was convenient and his life wasn't important anyway." They use euphemisms so people don't have to face the reality of deliberate murder. They might say, "The donor was terminated". Or, "We have harvested his life energy". Or, "We freed up hospital bed number 127". They won't call them "people", they'll make up some slang word for them, like racists use the n-word for black people. Or they'll have some very clinical, technical term, like they'll call them the "animafacients". (Latin for "life-force makers" -- I just made that word up, but you get the idea.)
