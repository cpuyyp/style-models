What is the best way to wrap a frame with bicycle inner tubes? The bike is an aluminium framed MTB with suspension (rather than a roadie-courier bike that usually gets subjected to such treatment). Can you use puncture repair glue or does it have to be 'gaffer tape'? Any tips will be most appreciated on how to do this effectively. Edit: As for the why question: there are various reasons why people would want to do this - to protect the bike from railings being one, to make it less attractive to thieves is my concern, making it look 'individual' is another reason to do it. I was really hoping that someone here has had a go and might want to share what they learned from doing so. 

Personally I changed my riding out of the saddle habits when I bought a speedometer. Rarely did I notice an increase in speed when out of the saddle, typically getting a 1 - 1.5 mph drop even if I felt I was going faster. Dancing on the pedals clearly has its place on very steep hills and competitive situations, but, for general riding, for me, staying seated and using the gears is more efficient. There seems to be a misconception here about the 'strain placed on the rear derailleur'. Let's be clear that no matter how strong you are or how weak you are, or how heavy you are, or how light you are, any extra force applied to the pedals will not make a big difference to the mechanical lifetime of the rear derailleur. The reason for this is that only the top part of the drive-train is under tension. The first few teeth at the top of the chainring and the first few teeth at the top of the sprocket do all the work, where the chain wraps around at the bottom is not under tension - the derailleur cage spring provides what tension there is and that does not increase just because you are going-for-it. The rear derailleur feeds the chain in at the bottom in the low-tension part of the loop, the front derailleur does not - it acts on where the chain is tight (when pedalling), hence you definitely have to ease up when shifting chainrings. As for the chain and sprockets that is a different matter. When changing gear there will be a point when those first few teeth are actually on two different sprockets. Because the sprockets are of different size the chain will not have a smooth transition from one sprocket to the next and the shift of the load from one to the other may not be exactly smooth. With modern 'hyperglide' gears setup correctly the shift will be possible under load without too much scary goings-on. However this will result in mechanical wear. This wear will primarily be to the bushings of the chain resulting in what we call 'stretch'. In turn this 'stretch' will degrade the ability of the chain to spread the load over 'the first few teeth' of the sprockets (and chainset). The 'first few teeth' eventually becomes the 'first couple of teeth', then, with the load not spread the sprockets begin to wear, potentially resulting in a hooked shape that means only a 'stretched' chain will work with the gears. Notionally chains have a life of 1000 miles, 2000 for a posh one. I advise that you ride as you feel fit, keep the gears adjusted to work and replace the chain every 2000 miles to avoid damage to the sprockets and chainring. You can ride the gears into the ground, putting 10K miles on a chain but this means you end up with a bill for replacement parts that comes to a lot more than it would have cost to replace the chain as per its service instructions. 

In my experience smaller ones go in fine and last as per normal (not that I have pushed this to extremes with a 700x20 in a 700x40 but I only have 26x1.5 MTB tubes and they work fine in 26x2.00 tyres). Allegedly putting a smaller tube in the tyre becomes a problem if and when you repair it, the patch doesn't necessarily stretch with the inner tube and it can come off. 

You should take the opportunity to give your wheels and brake pads a good clean. A bucket of hot water with half a tablet of clothes washing powder and whatever brush you can find will do the job nicely. Wash off with more water and the accumulated dirt on your rims plus the lube will be gone. 

This is an interesting question, well suited to this site! The problem is a common one for touring cyclists wanting a 25-32mm tyre and mudguard, where the solution is to 'get a bike with cantilever bosses'. You have a compound problem of short reach, a measurement you could do with measuring. The dual-pivot brake doesn't offer a lot of tyre clearance, but do you need dual pivot anyway? Campagnolo groupsets have the dual pivot on the front but single pivot on the back, here is the affodable-style Veloce option: 

If you have a normal derailleur geared bike you can use it to work out what gear would work out best for you if you only had one gear to use. Simply ride your commute in one gear without changing gear. Pedal on the downhills rather than coast and see if you can keep up. After this experiment is over you will know what size chainring and sprocket works for you. 

The 'tire guide' screws are for deep section carbon fibre rims. The idea of the brake shoe holder is that you replace just the rubber bit, not the entire shoe. In this way you do not lose your settings, as happens when you replace the entire brake block, not just the rubber bit. For speedy wheel swapping, i.e. in race conditions, the 'tire guide' exists. These have been round for a few decades and were originally conceived with square, box section rims in mind, e.g. original 'Mavic' rims such as the MA40. The problem with deep section rims and tire guides is that, when the brake wears down, the rim can come in contact with the tire guide. The last thing the rim needs is to be scored all the way round by the metal tire guide. This could damage the rim beyond its cosmetic appearance. As for the brake block, the last thing it needs is for the tire guide part of it to be damaged by being worn off onto the rim. This would not be a problem if the whole brake block was swapped out when worn, but, nowadays, it is just the rubber bit that gets swapped out. Enter the 'tire guide screws'. These are made of a plastic that wears away quicker than metal does. So, when the brakes are worn, the plastic shoe hits the deep section of the aero rim instead of the metal tire guide. The rider notices this through what the brakes feel and sound like, to hopefully cotton on that it is time to put some new brake block inserts in. Instead of the brake block holders and the rim getting damaged, these simple plastic screws get worn down. Replacement plastic screws don't come with the R55C carbon rim brake pad inserts, although they do come with the replacement brake blocks: $URL$ Personally I think it is interesting how patents like this work. There is 'prior art' with tire guides covered in a plastic coating from the pre-deep rim era, Shimano update the concept with nothing more than a plastic screw and get a patent out of it. 

If price is your prime consideration you may want to pay a visit to your local bike shop. Spare chainrings are not a hot seller and there may be a chance that your local shop can do you a deal on a ring that has not sold or had any interest from customers. On a single speed I don't think top quality is your prime consideration from the chainring. You have two material choices - steel or aluminium. The steel ones come in cheap and expensive 'ultra durable' flavours. We all know that steel (whether stainless or not) is heavier than aluminium (not that it amounts to a lot of difference on a chainring), so take a look at the aluminium offerings. Remember that you can flip a worn chainring over in some cases, to get twice the wear out of it. If you are going the local bike shop route, make sure you know what BCD means. You want the holes to match up to your crank spider, and for there to be the correct quantity of holes. You also want to make sure there is no wow and flutter. Surface scratches can be easily removed (except on black anodized rings) so have a root around in your LBS and ask what they have knocking around in the workshop if getting a deal is of your prime concern. Hope that helps. 

Allegedly chain-drive gears are something like 99% efficient when well oiled and something like 98% efficient when without oil. Personally I do not like the noise a dry chain makes, this has a 'I must be going slow' psychological effect on my riding so, even if I am not going slow, I think that I am. For this reason I never drive with a dry chain. If the efficiency gains of an oiled chain are minor then that means the main reason for oiling the chain is to reduce wear/prevent rust rather than efficiency/speed. This is why I would like to know the efficiency of a chain when oiled as well as dry. Comparisons against other drive mechanisms and their efficiency, e.g. bicycle shaft drive, automatic car transmission are also of interest to put the oiled/dry chain in context. 

This depends on where you live, however, in the UK the cycling season is May to September. Nowadays, in the UK, Christmas is a minor blip, not a sales extravaganza as people wanting kids bikes go to non-specialist shops and get something cheap. Much like how Christmas comes earlier and earlier every year, so it is with 'next year model' bikes. As a consequence you can have two model years in the showroom. Sometimes the model range is tweaked (e.g. Ridgeback) or all new (e.g. Giant). Tweaked model ranges tend not to precipitate a sale price on the old models, all new model ranges can result in sale prices for the old ones. Given the above, February is probably the best month, i.e. when the local bike shop is most wanting any money in the cash register for cashflow reasons. The question is, do you really want the bike that nobody else wanted, the one that has already seen a few test rides and been knocked about a bit? It can be a case of buyer beware but definitely worth looking out for. However, given that the new bike will hopefully be your pride and joy, consider getting a new bike, in your size, on special order so that it is truly brand new. If you have the mechanic skills try to get the bike in the box rather than assembled. Some shops will give you a fair discount for that if you have the ability to convince them that you can set it up all by yourself. Check the contents of the box when you collect it, take it home and have fun setting up the bike perfectly... 

This depends on where you live, however, in the UK the only widely available hub brakes are the Shimano Nexus series. These are 36 hole and can be retro-fitted to an existing bike designed for rim brakes. Given that you will be needing spokes as well as the hubs, consider getting some rims that will work with your hub brakes, i.e. not needing the surface for the rim-brake. Have fun building them up or pay the small fee that a professional wheel builder will charge. Visit a good shop and go out on a bike that does have Shimano Nexus - try before you buy. They may not be what you are looking for - with performance benefit in the wet but not with the feel that you are used to. Generally 36H is a good idea for wheels that have the stopping gubbins in the centre as the forces are different to that of a rim-brake wheel - you are decelerating the centre and exposing the spokes to more force. By building a new set of wheels you will be able to keep the old wheels - or find a friend to take ownership of them - and not have a bunch of left over hubs 'n' spokes kicking around. 

There are some very good answers on here that go part way to explaining why there are something like 2000 saddles on the market. You did not mention whether you dress up for your daily commute with padded cycling shorts, however, your hybrid bike is designed for more general use, i.e. jeans and T-shirt, not the padded shorts. Hence it has a padded seat and a chainguard (to keep your jeans out of the chainset). Meanwhile, the road-bike is designed for riding with the padded shorts (although you can probably get back from the pub on it with your jeans tucked into your socks perfectly fine, even if you have had a few and take the tow-path route back with no lights, ahem.) You also did not mention what build you are. We all have physical differences, some people have bigger bones, some people have more natural padding. Taking the other (very high quality) answers into account, I would suggest going for the narrow seat and investing money in quality padded shorts. Affordable-style shorts will not do, get the deluxe ones and make sure you follow the wash instructions to the letter. It is also important to get the setup right. You cannot go far wrong with putting the seat (any seat) so that the top is completely level and in the middle of the saddle rails. Then, over time you can fine tune that setup, to make sure you are not repositioning yourself, continually slipping off the front and so forth. Pointing exactly forward is also a detail to get right. An expensive, top-end seat that is setup wrong will give more grief than a seat that is setup as just described. (You should take this into account when choosing your dream-road-bike as some bike shops have nice bikes with seats tilting weirdly and this can put you off the bike as a whole.)
