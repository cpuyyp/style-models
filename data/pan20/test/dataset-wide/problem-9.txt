(above is a series of orbits. description is most similar to orbit D) The question is then, within these constraints, how do I figure out how long each 'season' is? And would the planet's speed be constant throughout its journey around the sun? EDIT: The parent star is exactly like our sun. Same age, size, and composition. The planet I am talking about has the same composition as Earth, and the same atmosphere. as for the orbit. I figure that the star is in the centre of Focal Point 1. With the closest approach being 0.49 AU and the furthest distance being 3.2 AU (if wikipedia is correct about our sun's Circumstellar Habitable Zone being between 0.5 and 3 AU. If not, please tell me and I'll correct this.) As for the planet, it has the same axial tilt as Earth, and the same wobble. Sorry if this is a bit boring to those that can do the actual math involved, but my focus is more on psychology, sociology, and biology. This is slightly above my paygrade. As a bonus question. How long would the surface be uninhabitable during the two closest approaches? Are we talking just the period the planet is in the 'too hot zone'? I could imagine it would become unbearably hot well outside the 'too hot zone', making the dual summers too much for the populous to bear. 

Well, I am no biology major, but as a nurse I would like to think I know something about healing (natural and aided). TL;DR: There's more going on than 'acceleration'. You need to consider the nutrients needed to maintain this new system, and the speed at which 'fresh nutrients' are absorbed. First let's start with the 'normal' healing rate, and why it's so comparatively slow -- ignoring that many (most?) species heal at an even slower rate than humans do. Depending on the injury, you need to look at the damage done. So, here's some injuries and how the body naturally deals with it. 

For Amon, it was freedom from benders. He played on the fears of those who couldn't bend, showed them what a renegade bender could do to people that couldn't bend -- and they are oh so arrogant, too! For Trump, it's far more insidious. He plays on racial bias, the desire for "a great, Christian nation", and so many other things. 

I am going to suggest some written (and reasonably priced written works) First, The Writer's Complete Fantasy Reference (ISBN-13: 003-5313107108) This is one of my go-to books for developing settings. It covers various forms of government, magic, militaries, social hierarchy, gods and more. It should cover you on the list of professions but it does not (to my recollection) provide #/Population figures. Here are some pics of the table of contents for reference: 

Magic is simply energy right? So long as the systems meet your needs and aren't ridiculous in and of themselves I have no trouble with the concept of multiple systems in one world. What you really need to define are the sources of the energy, the limits of each source and how a user accesses that energy. In the physical world we have many forms of energy. We have fossil fuels, solar, hydro, wind, geothermal, chemical and probably other forms of energy. Suggesting a magic system with multiple power sources really doesn't strain suspension of disbelief any more than having magic in the first place. So again. Define the following: Source: Where does the power come from. In your case there is 

First I want to define the nations we are looking at. The term Third World is actually a carry over from the Cold War, where: 

Many many things to consider here... Location will be crucial. There are reasons why large cities only showed up in certain places around the globe prior to industrialization. Location plays an even larger role in the case of a city that is not part of an empire...though I would argue that to be this large in the middle ages you simply have to be a part of an empire, its the only social structure of the era that could support that population for an significant period of time. 

Or skin stores water and fat and other metabolic products. What happens when we make our skin bullet-proof? Well it sort of depends on how you want to do that. You can either make the skin more dense, make it thicker, or since you want to stop bullets, likely a combination of the two. Thicker, denser skin will make temperature regulation a challenge. Either your rock men should live in a colder climate, that is less prone to temperature swings or you are going to have to hand-wave this. Alternatively you could alter the method of heat reduction, dogs as the obvious example pant to reduce their body temperature. This may still require a bit of hand-waving, I am not sure but I would hazard a guess that panting becomes less effective/efficient as the size of the animal increases. When you increase the density and thickness of a substance you make it stronger but you also make it more inflexible. Odds are these humanoids of yours are not going to be as agile as a regular human. Conversely they will likely be stronger. As one other post mentioned they are going to need to be stronger to support the additional weight of their armored skin. The additional weight reduces their agility as well...momentum and all that. I suppose this would also lead to reduced touch sensitivity, which considering the skin is much tougher isn't a huge problem in a lot of ways. It would be a problem when it comes to fine motor skills and you are probably going to want to make the skin thinner where need be to account for that. On a side note, facial expressions are going to be pretty drastically subdued if they exist at all, its tough to emote if your skin doesn't want to move. As far as the point on storage goes I don't see any problems in the cross over. If anything you would probably want to make this system more robust as getting hit in un-padded armor will still hurt pretty bad. Final notes: Keep in mind that if this evolved via natural means you won't have uniform thickness. Having the core and perhaps upper legs and arms armored would provide protection and help maintain agility, plus the resources to armor everything are biologically expensive...best survival wins. When it comes to survival really tough skin is good, but so is mobility. Rhinos and Elephants have super thick skin sure...but they also don't have fingers. Maintaining a decent level of mobility is going to be important for your humanoids, if you want them to in fact be humanoid. As someone else mentioned you can have hair if you want to, it doesn't technically grow through the skin, but out of little holes. 

By WW2 technology had progressed to where very large guns were no longer considered the way to go, so by your own statement that that's the level of technology your ship would be obsolete by the time it was launched. For shore bombardment, a larger number of smaller guns, possibly in combination with rockets and/or aircraft is far more effective. Larger spread of fire per salvo if you so wish, shorter reload times (thus higher fire volume on target), more stable (and thus more accurate), easier to transport (smaller ships, or same size ships with more guns), and losing one ship is less likely to cost you the bulk or all of your firepower. As said in the other answers already, the stability of a ship as a firing platform for something this massive is highly questionable to put it mildly, another reason shipboard cannon peaked at the 18" mounted on the Japanese Yamato class battleships, and at 15-16" for other navies. Another major problem for a weapon that big is that the barrel of the gun only lasts a very limited number of shots, and replacing the barrel while underway is next to impossible. After a few days of firing (at a rate of 1-2 shots per hour) your ship is useless unless it were as a command ship or for its secondary batteries and sensors, just a big inviting target for enemy forces. Not only do the barrels of smaller guns last longer, they're also easier to replace (whether that was ever attempted at sea with main battery guns I don't know, most likely they were replaced regularly during port visits). Another point not mentioned yet is that the weapon, in order to have both the shell weight of the Gustav AND the range of the Paris gun, would have to be humongous. Just adding a longer barrel to the Gustav (which was a mortar btw) wouldn't do it. You need a lot more steel, making the barrel extremely thick (and thus heavy) in order to contain the propellant gasses from the massive charge (several times larger than the charge used in the Gustav OR the Paris gun). And to elevate that massive weight you need far larger mechanisms as well. End result is a weapon of utterly impractical dimensions, a weapon that's probably too large to fit on any ship envisioned in WW2 or since. 

Went and found a list of human blood components on Wikipedia. Every building block of human life is in there. Is it there in quantities to support a human who functioned on nothing but blood...probably not. Especially considering that a human consuming blood usually gets nausea. All the major proteins (that I can think of), fats, minerals, sugars, etc etc etc are present in blood which makes sense as the body's pick-up and delivery system. But you can make the assumption that vampires don't require the same exact nutrients as a human. If they're not biologically different then...well they're not vampires. So yes, you're sane. 

There aren't a whole lot of merits to using two spears, in fact I can think of exactly two situations where it might be useful. Negatives: 

You could probably get away with ignoring syntax completely. If the Ents are able to share that much information that rapidly having a sentence structure seems un-necessary. Though you could alter the definition to create a structure for the flow of information. It would probably work kind of like charades in that you don't use words to convey ideas but there is an expected order information will be provided in, 3 words, 1st word, 4 syllables, act like a moron trying to get the idea across. You can see how that could easily be modified to fit images/sensations/etc Phonology 

Of course. Size is very important, both the size of the invader and the invaded. But it is more complex than that. Size is important, but so is population density and geography. Just try invading and assimilating the Balkans, or Afghanistan. 

I would just add that, I would not want to keep an infectious shell of a former family around for sentimental reasons. Now, I can see a trade springing up if the zombies were not infectious, or perhaps they are only infectious for 6 months at which point they are harmless simpletons, but even then I wouldn't do that to a family member...well maybe one or two but not most of them. 

Your planet would require a couple things that of course come with their own complications... Uniformity is tough to find in nature but its certainly not impossible. If you have a planet without plate tectonics and that is also very old (meaning highs and lows have evened out over time) you could end up with a planet smooth enough to spread the water more evenly over the surface. Not having plate tectonics likely means you do not have a liquid core which means you also likely don't have a magnetic field which means in time the atmosphere would be stripped away. If you are willing to handwave clearly it can be done. But I am not aware of a fully science based possibility. You would also likely need to not have a moon or at least not a large one as tidal forces can cause these problems as well. If on the other hand you don't mind having the ocean be significantly deeper in some places you could do it fairly easily.
