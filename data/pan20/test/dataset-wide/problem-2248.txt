Since you didn't limit the star(s) used, I'll give an example using the Sun. During the day, put a stick in the ground such that it casts a shadow. Mark the end of the shadow with another stick. Wait 15 minutes. The line from the original marked end of the shadow to current the end of shadow points due east. 

When a rifle has a scope where the relief is too short for comfortable shooting, are there any options other than replacing the scope? The scope has a adjustable relief, but even with that I have to push my head too far forward to see the full view. 

If I see a deer munching on a particular plant, is that enough to indicate that it's safe to eat? How about other animals? 

There are a number of considerations here, so getting educated is the first step in responding to the Red Eared sliders. There could be positive and negative effects. Contact your local conservation department. They'll know how to proceed. If the species is native, you might want to protect it from domestic animals. On the other hand, if you protect it from their normal predators, you might save the clutch of a mother who chose a poor location (or not), negating natural selection, and nurturing generations of turtles that don't choose good locations, thus saving a clutch to weaken the species. If the species is invasive, it's competing with native species, and may drive them to extinction within your range. Would you want to fertilize kudzu in the southern U.S., or protect rabbits in Australia? Are they a turtle that prefers to return to the site where they were hatched? In that case, it might be better for this clutch and the species at large if a conservation group could move the eggs to a more suitable location. Now, assuming you want to build a nest cage, that would keep out many types of predators, and that might include the one you're dealing with. But, you don't know what you're dealing with. Conservationists can help you with that. If you have your own trail cam, you might be able to see what the predator is. You need to know what it is in order to combat it successfully. As you can see, getting educated before acting is the most crucial first step in order to act for the best outcome for the environment as a whole. 

I've had this, too. You're just stressing different ligaments than when traveling uphill. I think it's a matter of getting the right exercise, which is to say, do the same thing on training hikes. I've also experienced pain in that area after crossing an ice-cold creek, then hiking after. Alleve is my drug of choice since I can take it at the beginning of the day and it lasts all the way through. 

There are people who swear by poles, and there are people hiking into their eighties without poles or knee trouble. Part of it is genetics, part of it is being intelligent about hiking. Poles may help with the symptoms, but wouldn't it be better not to cause the problems in the first place? If you're having knee problems, look at your pack weight. If your dry pack weight is high (say, 20+ pounds) work on reducing the weight. If you're not wearing the right shoe for long distance hiking (trail running shoes with a little padding) that's going to be hard on your knees. Buy or borrow a copy of Trail Life and read through it. I read it a couple years after getting back into hiking, and making the changes outlined in older versions of this book made hiking much more fun. The author Ray Jardine and his wife have hiked tens of thousands of miles through-hiking the AT, the PCT, and the CDT, among others. Trekking poles are extra weight, and therefore will require extra exertion. Furthermore, they're extra weight on a moving part of your body, just like shoes are, which further increases the importance of keeping them light. Fix the other issues first, if any, so that you're not just treating the symptoms instead of the cause. 

In season 3, episode 5 of Survivorman, Les Stroud mentions the value of throwing cow dung, or any variety of others, on a fire to drive away insects. And he has "no idea why." Why does this work? 

This isn't what you want to hear, but the best thing to do is to let nature take its course. There's a reason that some birds make it and some don't. If you help one make it that shouldn't have you're interfering with nature. Nature is harsh. This bird's death means something else gets to live. That's how it works, I'm afraid. 

I don't know what's recommended. I carry a Sawyer Extractor for snakebites. I've used it on a spider bite and various insect bites. It works by using a vacuum to extract the venom or whatever has entered the puncture. If I got stung by anything, including a scorpion, it's what I'd start with. 

When gap shooting or shooting a bow in general, there are a couple of advantages to keeping both eyes open. One is that having both eyes open gives you some amount of depth perception, so you can see how far your target is from you. Another is that with both eyes open there's less tension in your face, so your whole body can be more relaxed, and that should help you aim better. According to the Archer's Bible, "A type of sighting akin to the instinctive method, one that makes use of a "space picture," is called "gap shooting." In this method the archer looks at the target and nothing else but is still conscious of seeing the amount of space between the arrow tip and the target. The size of this space or gap becomes a measure of the angle of elevation, and the archer either consciously or unconsciously uses this measure for a distance." 

I've been using the same Evolv shoes for bouldering that I bought for top-roping. It seems like they're worn enough to start considering a new pair of shoes. Since I'm doing bouldering almost exclusively now, I'm thinking about getting shoes designed specifically for that activity. What should I look for and what should I avoid? 

In season 3 episode 2 of Survivorman, Les Stroud explains that red snow will make you sick. He also says that he doesn't know why it makes you sick. What's in it that makes you sick? 

There's a delightful thrill to the call of a band of coyotes when you're alone in the dark woods. Do they present a danger? That is, have healthy coyotes (that is, not rabid) been known to attack or show aggressiveness to a lone human? 

I currently use a Sawyer Filter without using purification. I carry iodine tablets as a backup. Iodine's been in use for decades, and I don't worry at all about using them when necessary. Ray J. recommends being smart about choosing your water sources, which I am. When I was a kid I drank straight from the streams without any purification or any problems, so perhaps I have some immunities from that. People today are way too worried about water purification, if you ask me. People in some countries survive worse water from their taps than we have from our streams. We also worry too much about chemicals, probably. Water is a chemical, and an extremely dangerous one in pure form.
