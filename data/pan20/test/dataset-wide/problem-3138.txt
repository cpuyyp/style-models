(-1-) The reason why the Sarissa Pike requires larger formations was because of it's length. It was twice as long as a normal hoplite spear. In a typical phalanx any foe approaching the phalanx would be faced with layers of spear tips to contend with. The longer spear's advantage was in part due to more layers. The longer spear meant people in the fifth row could use their spear tips against a closing enemy. But this required their be a fifth row of spearmen. Larger base formations meant slower overall units, which were less flexible, more susceptible to difficulties with terrain, but they were also heavier, better protected, and better able to smash smaller enemy units matched against them on even terrain. 

The United States agreed to pay the Bey of Tripoli annual tribute in exchange the Bey of Tripoli agreed not to capture our ships and enslave our merchant men years before the first Barbary War began. 

The "city" was sacked by Franks, Crusaders in 1204. because as it was on their rout to the holy lands and the ME. The Crusaders even sacked the Christian city of Constantinople that year. They didn't hold it long. 

The picture shows the skeletal corpse of a dead German infantryman (the helmet is clearly German) outside a dugout shelter. It has become fairly famous, and is featured in the opening credits of the classic BBC documentary series The Great War. The fact that the body was left in situ long enough for the flesh to decay completely suggests to me that it may be from one of the most lengthy engagements on the Western Front - perhaps the Somme Campaign or the Battle of Verdun, either late in the battle or shortly after it ended, but this is just an informed guess. Do we know who this man was, where and when the picture was taken, or anything else about it? 

According to several sites - none of which offer sources or citations - the Arc De Triomphe de l'Étoile was damaged on or near the same day that the Battle of Verdun began in February 1916. These sites, including this one, claim that the Sword held by the Republic on the La Marseillais relief broke off. Some accounts go on to say that the damage was immediately concealed behind a tarp to prevent people from treating the damage as an omen portending disaster: 

Roosevelt was also in a position to read German and French newspapers in their native languages. Roosevelt read multiple papers, and then read collections of editorials as well as carried on extensive correspondences daily. Roosevelt believed war was inevitable. He recognized Hitler as a totalitarian bent on world dominance. The choice was simple to support the Democracies of Europe or stand alone when Hitler came for the United States. There was a side in the debate over lend lease which thought the United States had waited too long and that Britain was already too far gone. They believed Britain would either surrender or compromise with Hitler and that any war materials sent to her would be materials lost. Churchill’s famous we will fight them on the beaches...we will never surrender wasn’t just for domestic consumption. FDR's biggest job on the onset of the war were considerable. (1) to Prepare the US Army which when WWII began in 1939 was about the size of Belgium or Portugals military. (2) To work with the large and irrational isolationist political leadership who made up of roughly half of the U.S. legislature. (3) To keep Britain and then the USSR in the war, even if it mean breaking US laws. (4) To silence the very popular American First movement. 

This account comes to us in what is at least the third hand; the servant, presumably John Pernier, related the story to Captain Gilbert Russell, the commanding officer of Fort Pickering, at Chickasaw Bluffs, Tennessee, who later wrote a series of letters to William Clark. When Lewis had arrived at Fort Pickering, he was "in a state of mental derangement", and apparently drinking quite heavily; after he attempted to commit suicide, Russell "detained" Lewis in his personal quarters for about two weeks for his own safety. I have also heard that in his last hours, among other ravings, Lewis claimed that Clark was on his way to find Lewis and help him, but I haven't been able to find the source of this claim. Did Lewis have any reason to believe that Clark was coming to see him, and/or render some sort of assistance to him? 

How common was anti-Semitism in the United States during WWII? According to the book The Jews and the Nation, by Frederic Cople Jaher, the results of a 1938 poll were as follows: 

Congusbongus was correct. I'm submitting the answer because no answer has been submitted. I don't think it goes back to the middle ages. In the United States it's called the "saber arch" and we get it from the British Navy. It's a tradition at weddings of military service members, typically when exiting the building in which the wedding ceremony took place. Typically performed by members of the groom/brides? service branch/unit. Germany and Austria have a similar ceremony for fraternities. $URL$ 

I would not say "in ancient battles, being encircled meant defeat". Because that's not true. I would say, "in all battles, being encircled means defeat, unless you have good leadership which is prepared. Thus not so much in "ancient battles" does encirclement means defeat, just in the Battle of Cannae(216 BC). Encirclement alone wasn't the deciding factor in the Battle of Cannae. It's not like the Romans thew down their arms and surrendered after they were encircled. Encirclement is cited because it was seen as an achievement by a master tactician in general Hannibal of Carthage. Taking 40,000 and encircle the much larger 80,000 Roman army. It is why even to this day we consider Hannibal one of the greatest military tacticians ever. Hannibal did this because he believed the well disciplined Roman legions were both vulnerable to their rear and would panic if encircled. The Romans at Cannae used specific formations to wage war and those formations did not operate well with enemies in their rear. Which wasn't a problem because nobody could image a commander being able to encircle 80,000 Romans. The subsequent slaughter enabled by Hannibal's tactics both proved Hannibal right, and decided the battle. Contrast this with the Roman battle of Alesia (52 BC). The Romans under Julius Cesar laid siege to the Gallic fortress of Alesia. Alesia's allies arrived and surrounded the Romans who were still surrounding Alesia. (think of a giant donut) Cesar planned for this and had built fortifications in an outer ring to his fortifications besieging Alesia. At one point the Romans were outnumbered by 4 to 1 and surrounded. Yet in the end the Romans won, because they had the superior leader, and had planned well. 

The University of Kiel website provides a convenient graph of Anne Stalsberg's findings. The table break the Stalsberg study's swords down into three categories according to age, as well as categories related to lettering variants: 

It began near the nexus of 3 continents: Europe, Asia, and Africa. It began during the Roman Empire, while the Empire was still relatively strong and robust, and controlled much of Europe and the Mediterranean, including North Africa. It had access to an extensive network of roads, and it had never been so easy to travel great distances. In Paul's letter to the Romans, he says he is planning a trip to Spain. He traveled throughout Asia Minor, Palestine, Greece, Macedonia, etc. By our modern standards, this wouldn't be very impressive, but this was happening 2,000 years ago, when the closest thing to an airplane was a horse, After the message was altered to make it less Jewish in nature, it became fairly inclusive. It was relatively unique in that it was a religion of belief rather than mere observance. It was also relatively unique in that it made promises of eternal rewards for the people who had been denied rewards in life. It was evangelical, and some of the apostles were brilliant PR men. Shortly after Jesus died, the new movement began to alter his message. This process has continued to this day, although at a much less drastic rate after the first couple of centuries. This is a huge benefit because it allowed the early church to become whatever its congregants needed it to be. 

The United States would fight two wars with the Barbary Pirates. What was the long term ramifications of the United States tussle with the Barbary Pirates? Thomas Jefferson and the Democratic Republicans recognized the worth of a standing professional navy. Lots of tribute paid in the mean while. A great origin story of how we went from paying tribute to armed struggle. It wasn't a foreign policy derived in Washington but involving one of the really heroic block heads of American History... William Eaton. Eaton had run away from home at 16 to join the colonial army. He had risen to officer under Washington. Had made and lost a fortune. He had been a spy master for President Adams who had helped thwart a Spanish invasion of Georgia. Now Adams would send William Eaton a "Man of Action" on a diplomatic mission to Tunisia, to the Barbary Pirates where he would get in all sorts of trouble. 

Modifications to the original, US Neutrality laws tried to tighten restrictions on German purchases while not entirely abandoning neutrality. No loans for war materials with belligerent countries which went into effect in 37 were seen to favor the allies. In general some trade with Germany was important because it gave Roosevelt the cover he needed to supply Britain goods while still preserving the facade of Neutrality which was a political necessity until after the 1940 Presidential election. Second Thought... I find it odd that this Russian gentleman was so worked up over this position of US neutrality on the part of the US given Russia up until Jun 22, 1941 (Operation Barbarossa/German invasion of the Soviet Union) was allied with Germany and actively conspiring with Hitler to carve up nations like Poland Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact. Also of coarse Russia benefited greatly of the US lend lease programs which were made possible by creative US neutrality laws. Yes US Companies legally sold goods to Germany prior to Pearl Harbor, and Yes some US companies continued to work with Germany as the United States was committed to defeating Germany on the battle field. These latter transactions occurred outside of US law and were investigated by the US as treason. (although with regards to Standard Oil of NJ, not prosecuted). I think what the Russian guy was yelling about were the business dealings of Standard Oil of New Jersey(Esso, which would become Exxon) and their dealings with Nazi Germany and the German chemical company IG Farben. Standard Oil of NJ supplied the Germans with important technology and raw materials (oil, gasoline, gasoline additives, manufacturing technology and synthetics technology) before and after the United States entered the war. Both legally and illegally. Senator Harry Truman ran a Senate committee which investigated companies who received war contracts. Wikipedia: William Stamps Farish II 

Conclusion: The actual numbers are unknown, but the largest study published to date identified the following: 

In fact, when Ford found the spurious (and libelous) anti-Semitic hoax document known as The Protocols of the Elders of Zion, he believed it to be genuine, and reprinted several sections of it in his newspaper, the Dearborn Independent: 

The article shown in this picture led to the publication of Ford's anti-Semitic screed, The International Jew: The World's Foremost Problem, which was translated into German and became one of Adolf Hitler's inspirations. It is said that Ford is the only American mentioned in Hitler's autobiographical political manifesto Mein Kampf. 

Number of Extant VLFBERHT swords: I came across the closest available approximation to an answer we're likely to get: 

In a surprising number of conflicts, propagandists have accused enemy troops of very similar (and appalling) atrocities. Among the most common allegations are claims that babies had been impaled on swords, spears, pikes, or bayonets, and that fetuses had been sliced from the bellies of pregnant women. Some examples of groups being accused of these activities throughout history: Irish Catholic forces in the Rebellion of 1641: 

The US Civl War was a little different. It wasn't the US picking the sides it was rather the British. In this war the British would threaten to come in on the Confederates side twice. British industrial age clothing looms demanded cotton which the south could provide, that was the motivation. Lincoln and his secretary of state (William Henry Seward) would do a masterful job in keeping the British out. 

Morality is subjective. Certainly from an Israeli perspective it was moral. Iraq was one of Israel's greatest existential threats in 1980. Any action to dissuade an agressive existential threat, who's demonstrated a proclivity for using military action first; from obtaining nuclear weapons can be broadly referred to as moral. As I remember at the time the American President Ronald Reagan criticized Israel for taking this action. His Vice President George Bush as I remember, on the eve of the first gulf war didn't share Reagan's feelings in 1990. As for the nuclear site containing Plutonium. No it was a Uranium reactor, which would produce Plutonium only after operational. It's been said the Plutonium the plant was capable of producing was limited. Either way the Osirak reactor was not operational. It was feared that the Plant contained Uranium at the time of the attack. That was a fear of the Iranian government who was consulted by Israel prior to the attack(*). That's why Israel did not strike the dome itself but the control room and the reactor's cooling system. 

Again, the allegations of bayoneted babies was accompanied by claims of pregnant women being cut open and their fetuses removed: 

Obviously, no one expected that the Hindenburg would explode during the mooring process, so it the expectation would have been that a passenger aircraft was going to arrive, the passengers would disembark, and that would be it. This wasn't the first time that a zeppelin had crossed the Atlantic; it wasn't even the first time the Hindenburg itself had crossed the Atlantic. So why was a reporter from Chicago in New Jersey to report on the Hindenburg's arrival? 

I'm imagining people of color taking a train (or bus, for that matter) from the south to the north during the period when segregation was largely phased out in the north but still law in the south. When they get on the train or bus, the law forces them to sit in a separate area, use "colored only" facilities, etc. Then the train or bus enters a state where segregation is no longer law. Do they get to sit where they want, use whichever restrooms they want, drink from whatever water fountain they choose, etc? Would the same system apply to a trip from the north to the south?
