I had always read this as Bastian somehow bringing the Water across the barrier between the two worlds, and thus as the one solid counter to the idea that it all takes place in Bastian's head. However, as pointed out in the comments, Bastian is unaware that his entire journey took place overnight, and thus that his garments are indeed still wet from his previous night's rains. With that said, given that this is a work of reconstructivist art, I don't think the dual interpretations are either unintentional or incompatible. Ende is telling us that this is simultaneously both Real AND in all in Bastian's head, those are not different things within the larger framework Ende is creating. 

It seems likely that Adams was just taking an opportunity to get one more adolescent dig in at an old friend and rival, who thus got to be immortalized as the "worst poet in the universe." Sources claim that Adams was a regular contributor to Johnstone's high school English zine, and that the two of them jointly received a prize in English while attending the Brentwood School in Essex. The poem attributed to him in the book as an example of his wretchedness was actually written by him (I'm guessing as another high school joke). An old schoolmate of both of them remembers Johnstone as "unbearably pompous for a 19-year old" but Adams as only slightly less so. His name was disguised in the print editions of The Hitchhiker's Guide as "Paula Nancy Millstone Jennings," after he complained, apparently not because of being called the "worst poet" but because his complete actual home address was included in the original broadcast (which seems like a reasonable concern). So in other words, Adams was both trolling Johnstone and doxing him, doubtlessly for his own personal amusement. Would any one among us do less for an old high-school friend? 

If I read Dylan correctly, he, a contrarian if ever there was one, is actually arguing that his songs are not "literature" as the term is commonly understood. Of course, this also implies his award is a mistake. Not many people would deliver a Nobel Prize lecture suggesting that their award was an error, but again, this is Bob Dylan we're talking about. Once we let go of the assumption that he clearly must be defending his suitability for the award, the piece reads much more naturally as a defense against his songs being primarily considered as literature (rather than as living works that must be performed to truly be appreciated). 

I accepted my answer to the question because I'm relatively satisfied with the interpretation and nobody else has put forth an answer, but I don't think the question is fully complete. I tried following up on the possible connection between these lines and The Book of Revelation, but Tennyson's religious life and beliefs are extremely complicated, and I only wound up with dead ends. 

"No one else to pass a word with" seems to indicate that Rat doesn't talk with anyone at all - likely including any servants or a housekeeper he could manage to fit in his home (which is, compared to Toad Hall, quite small). Later on, it seems that Rat's picnics come from his own effort, not someone else's. After talking with Otter, the subject of the conversation with Mole swings back to food: 

This is certainly a valid interpretation - and one I agree with, because, to be frank, Ligeia is really about whether or not death can be overcome. Granted, some feel that Ligeia did in fact conquer death, but the same basic reasoning is used: Poe included the poem to just emphasize the human struggle with mortality. As an interesting side note, the name "Ligeia" also appears in Poe's poem Al Aaraaf (1829). 2. A Predicament and How to Write a Blackwood Article You brought up a pair of short stories, published together under different names in 1838. Both have the same protagonist, who refers to herself as the Signora Psyche Zenobia. The plots are otherwise remarkably bizarre and separate from one another; the former is about the odd decapitation of said protagonist, while the latter is something of a social commentary on horror and suspense writing, which was of course Poe's specialty. If I'm interpreting them correctly, A Predicament is the story of how the Signora Psyche Zenobia inadvertently (I believe) carries out her assignment from How to Write a Blackwood Article: to die and record her thoughts on the matter. The details I leave to anyone who wishes to read the stories in full. 3. Poems written as "Tamerlane" This is another peculiarly connected group of poems. You may know of Poe's 1827 poem Tamerlane, published in his collection entitled Tamerlane and Other Poems (1827). What's curious is that Poe actually signed some of his poems as "Tamerlane", for reasons I cannot explain. They include 

During Bastian's return from Fantastica, the following sequence of events takes place (starting on page 388 in my Dutton 1997 edition): 

By "Plato's whimsies" he almost certainly means the idea of the Ideal Forms, or more in general, the metaphysical idea of their being another layer of "Reality" deeper and more real than our own, and from which our own is a forever imperfect copy. These ideas were made explicitly religious by the Neoplatonists, and then incorporated into Christian theology via the work of St Augustine and other early Christian theologians --this work being the "artificial Christianity" Jefferson is also deriding. Jefferson describes Plato's Ideals as foggy and misty. This is because of Plato's claim that we can only grasp them in part here (in the ordinary world), and that any version of them we envision is necessarily incomplete and inaccurate. Jefferson's language probably deliberately echoes St. Paul's famous metaphor of "seeing in a mirror, darkly" as the natural condition of moral, earthly life. Also note that his description of Plato as a "genuine sophist," is a backhanded compliment at best, since Plato consistently portrayed the sophists (who were pre-Socratic philosophers) as superficial wisdom peddlers constantly being bested by Socrates. (This would be like calling Jesus a "genuine Pharisee.") Jefferson is further suggesting that it is only because of (what he would probably view as) the historical accident of a syncretic synthesis of Christian and Platonic ideas that Plato's reputation and philosophies survive at all, despite what he sees as their blatant silliness. His last statement implies that most modern thinkers wouldn't give such obsolete ideas even the ghost of a thought, but that it is enjoyable to talk them over, even dismissively, with someone else educated in the ancient Classics and Christian theology. (It is, however, worth noting that we still study Plato, even two more centuries past the time of Jefferson. Furthermore his "whimsies" were already 300 years old at the time of Christ --and twice that by the time Augustine learned them.) 

I've been studying a lot of Tennyson, and I recently read The Kraken. The first 12 lines seem relatively straightforward, describing the giant beast that sleeps at the bottom of the sea, but the final three lines are peculiar: 

TL;DR: There are a few connections between Poe's works, generally via one story being directly or indirectly referenced in another one published later. However, there are two instances of multiple stories having the same universe, and sometimes the same characters: A Predicament and How to Write a Blackwood Article, and The Landscape-Garden, The Domain of Arnheim and Landor's Cottage. 

Barrett Browning exhibited the same devotion to her father, even though he has been variously described as "despotic" and "overprotective and tyrannical". All the same, he (as well as her mother) encouraged Barrett Browning's reading, education, and subsequent writing. Indeed, we see many connections between this real-life education and Aurora's books. Names run off like a stream of rushing water: Theophrast, Aelian, and other Classical writers (who are referenced again in allusions later in the poem). There is no doubt that the relationship with Barrett Browning's father echoes in the writing in Aurora Leigh. As the essay I cited earlier points out, Aurora's interactions with Romney Leigh can also be viewed as commentary on her own life. We see clear disconnect between the two from the beginning, as they go through adolescence and young adulthood together: 

Tennyson’s work is often permeated with social and political commentary. We see many patriotic poems (Ode on the death of the duke of Wellington, The Charge of the Light Brigade, and others), especially surrounding his period as Poet Laureate. It may seem easy to criticize him as upholding the political ideas, rigid class system and moral codes of the Victorian era, and in a sense, this is true. Several views that we today might consider backward, for instance, are evident in Locksley Hall, in the narrator’s attitude towards women and non-Europeans - though these do not necessarily correspond with Tennyson’s own opinions. I’d specifically like to look at Tennyson’s views in revolution. F. J. Sypher’s Politics in the Poetry of Tennyson describes him as one who “praised revolution abroad, but not at home; who desired change, but not too fast”. Take a look at several lines from stanza CXIII of In Memoriam A.H.H. (highlighted by Christopher Ricks in Tennyson):
