One of the ancient debates in Chinese legal history going back thousands of years was between the "rule of man" and the "rule of law", a debate which in China ended up favoring the former rather than the latter. In a rule of man regime, the formal law is very simple indeed. Each person is subordinate to his superior and each superior owes a duty to deal justly with his subordinates, and a not terribly set of rules clarifies who is superior to whom. The secret to the success of such a regime is to insure that superiors appoint virtuous and competent people to be their direct subordinates. If that task is manageable, this simple rule of man regime can suffice to rule sprawling empires and to some extent this is basically how all large modern bureaucracies in business, in government, in religious organizations and in other non-profits work. A leading argument in favor of a rule of man regime over a rule of law regime is that it fundamentally isn't feasible to put together a set of laws that can govern every situation in a large and complicated society that is understandable and free from a risk of manipulation at the hands of amoral lawyers. Since any rule of law system must ultimately be implemented by people who need to be virtuous and competent to work well anyway, an elaborate set of legal rules themselves is really just superfluous, the argument goes. Notably, the common law system of case law from which the English rule of law system ultimately emerged, was based upon a foundation that looked more like the Confucian rule of man regime than a rule of law regime. The new Norman king of England who conquered it in 1066 CE installed his top military officers as nobles in a feudal hierarchy in a manner more or less corresponding to the organization that they had held within his military, and gave each of these nobles the authority to do justice in accordance with their common sense and local custom and tradition, subject to review by aristocrats superior to them in the feudal hierarchy. Subordinates were expected to follow the leader of their superiors, but otherwise, justice was a matter to be discovered by these esteemed former military officers and their esteemed descendants, rather than something to be ordained in advance by the King issuing details orders for every situation. Eventually, their collective wisdom guided more strongly by those at the top of the feudal hierarchy than by those at the bottom, organically gave rise to a set of rules deduced after the fact in efforts to reconcile the collective rulings of these aristocrats (originally holding court personally and later having designee judges hold court on their behalf as their agents). In the long run, as this system ossified, it became elaborate and rule driven, but at first, it was very simple. 

Yes You could certainly have a world in which there were no materials suitable for building a crossbow, although this might make regular bows and arrows also impossible to build, and might require significant deviations from a typical medieval fantasy setting. A Lack Of Adequate Crossbow Making Materials For example, you could have a world in which there were no good supplies of the kind of wood suitable for making a crossbow (e.g. consider the kinds of wood available in Hawaii, or the Sahara desert, or Death Valley, or Greenland, or "Waterworld", or an everglades scale swamp with no big trees that make suitable wood). In a world with only bamboo, or only shrubby small and thin woods, if any, or no wood at all, it would be very hard to build a crossbow. (This is probably the best "hard science" solution.) In a close variant of this possibility, it would theoretically be possible to make a crossbow, but the materials would be so expensive, that it would be far cheaper to train people to use other kinds of projectiles. Or, maybe there is an absence of the kind of plant or animal fibers that are suitable to stretch for enough pounds of draw to make a crossbow or bow viable as a weapon. In variants of that possibility, maybe it is so hard to stretch the bowstring fiber relative to the draw strength involved that no one is strong enough to pull it and no one has figured out how to use simple machines to draw the string, or maybe the only fabric that is suitable for use as a bow string can only be used once after which it loses all elasticity. An Environment Hostile To Inventing A Crossbow You could also have a world in which the utility of a crossbow was so low that nobody would bother to invent them. For example, imagine a place that is almost always fogged over (e.g. in a mountain top cloud bank or an exaggerated version of London), or a place so dark that only firefly-like glowing plants provide illumination for very short ranges. In that environment, long range weapons would be useless. Or, maybe the local atmosphere is so thick to the point of being almost gelatinous, or has such a strong gravitational field, that projectiles swiftly slow down even when propelled powerfully. Of course, this would profoundly influence a whole host of elements of your world. A Lack Of Demand In A Militarized World As implied in the question and noted in another answer, for many purposes, a crossbow is inferior to a bow in the hands of a skilled practitioner. A crossbow can still have utility if you have lots of untrained peasants and you want them to fight with projectile weapons. But, if your world is full of places like legendary Sparta, where every able bodied person was trained for war from early childhood, the crossbow would fill a need that didn't exist, and no one would invent one. Alternately, there might be an alternative that is just better in all respects than a crossbow that is easily to use. For example, maybe someone invents a "tandem bow" that requires one unskilled strong person to draw and notch, and another skilled person who need not be physically strong to aim, and each sub-task is much easier to teach than having one person do everything, that outperforms a crossbow in all respects. Effective Countermeasures There could also be countermeasures easily available that makes a crossbow an invention that isn't worth the trouble. Maybe your world has a special kind of cork that is easily and cheaply produced and easily applied to armor, that functions like Kelvar and easily absorbs the blow of arrows and crossbow bolts distributing the energy harmlessly across the entire body of the person wearing the armor. Or, maybe your world has extremely fast, easily trained and loyal companion birds to soldiers who are capable of rushing out and grabbing arrows and crossbow bolts with their beaks in the blink of an eye. Or, maybe it has giant companion frogs who sit on a soldier's shoulders who can shoot out their tongue and grab arrows or bolts out of the air. 

I'm a bit more of an optimist. If you were lucky and had a few people who stepped up and were experienced and talented leaders with an immediate vision (e.g. someone experienced leading large military units to organize aid following major natural disasters), it might be possible to get a critical mass of people into a series of large organized chiefdom polities with perhaps several hundred to a thousand people each quite quickly. And, the bigger the short term initial groups are, the less time it takes for them to consolidate with each other into something resembling proper nations. Normally, it is hard to get people to coalesce around a leader, but in a total vacuum of leadership or society organization, it is amazing how many people one leader can get to follow their lead spontaneously. For example, I have run large (several hundred attendee) political caucuses in Presidential election years on several occasions. And, most people have no clue what to do. But, if you shout clearly and loud enough to be heard by everyone in earshot and act like you know what you are doing, and quickly draft a few people who aren't totally dazed to be your lieutenants, you can bring a gathering that large to order remarkably quickly because in the situation, nobody resists your authority that you establish in mere seconds. I've either heard described, or seen with my own eyes, similar feats of mass crowd control at political rallies, rock concerts, boy scout jamborees, military exercises, religious gatherings, sporting events, a beach full of people where someone has figured out that a tsunami is imminently en route, and in cities facing imminent air raids or attacks in wartime. A loud voice and communication of a clear vision from someone who sounds like they know what their doing can go a long way, as long as the vision holds out. The trick is, however, that for this to work, the would be leader has to seize authority over a large group while everyone in that large group is atomized and hasn't had time to form localized alliances and factions with their neighbors. If this happens enough times in the first couple of hours, the cause of civilization will be advanced by decades. If it doesn't, it will be a long slow haul. 

The state of Chiapas in Mexico, sometimes with the state of Oaxaca in Mexico has has insurgencies seeking indigenous people's rights. Part of Chiapas was once part of the Federal Republic of Central America (which existed in some form or another from 1821-1841). 

The solution given by Nex Terren was used in the common law (England and its former colonies) territory. Elsewhere, they used the equivalent of a money order. The bank would confirm that you had the money, then remove the money you were transferring from your account, then you would send the money order to somebody else, who could deposit it at their bank. The receiving bank would then only bear the risk of forged instruments and of a default by the sending bank which would generally be much more credit worthy than the customer. Cashier's checks, certified checks, money orders, electronic funds transfers, and giros are all essentially different ways of describing this same transaction. A similar device which also trades the creditworthiness of the bank for that of a customer is called a "letter of credit." In a letter of credit the bank promises to pay a certain amount of money upon the meeting of a condition, normally the presentation of some sort of document such as a release of lien or a warehouse receipt or a bill of lading showing that good have been dispatched to the buyer. The customer satisfies the local bank that he is good for the money (perhaps even depositing it in a special account that the bank controls for that amount of money) and the person induced to take action by the letter of credit only has to know that the bank is good for the money, not that the customer is good for it. 

Also, where terrestrial hunter-gathers assembled in extended camps in the Mesolithic era, there was also often "proto-farming" in which wild type predecessors of crops (often grains and berries) and animals that would eventually become domesticated (especially bunnies and flightless birds) were actively encouraged and regularly harvested, but neither the plants nor animals experienced the genetic changes that would make them domesticates that were especially well suited to controlled horticulture and herding. Here is an artist's impression of a Natufian (Mesolithic Levantine proto-farming) settlement: 

Smaller animals eat less, so cows are more useful than Bison if you have a limited supply of grazing land available (and early on in farming the Fertile Crescent where cattle were domesticated had a lot of forests that were cleared by early farmers for crops and much less open steppe pasture than it does now). Smaller animals are easier to control while using them to carry out farm labor than bigger animals like Bison, particularly for early herders whose animal control skills and techniques may not have been very sophisticated. To the extent that you want to prevent your cattle from walking off away from your farm with fences or rope leads, for example, it is much easier to restrain a cow than a Bison. You need bigger fences and stronger rope to restrain a Bison. At least in the winter, it appears that early Neolithic farmers may have used the common area of their homes as a combined family room/cattle barn. While having a bull in the China shop is bad, having a Bison in the China shop is worse. The comparatively smaller cow would have been preferable to the Bison to share your family room with on a bitterly cold night (in part to provide the humans with additional indoor heat from the animals as well as for the benefit of the animals who are protected from cold and wolves when indoors). Of course, sheep and goats would be better still to have indoors, but neither sheep nor goats are well suited to serving as beasts of burden, so there wouldn't have been any substitute beasts of burden to the cow at least until the donkey was domesticated in Egypt, after the European Neolithic Revolution had already started to expand into this "virgin territory" from a farmer's perspective.
