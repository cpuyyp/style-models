I've been watching a LOT of snare/trap setting videos. They spend an lot of time making the snares nigh invisible. None of these snares would seriously injure a person, but I would like to avoid hurting people with traps. Is there a way to flag a snare set or trap set so that it warns humans without also warning away the intended game? 

Long sleeve, breathable, wicking fabric. Failing that, long sleeve, ultralight and blousy (loose to allow lots of airflow). 

Simply - it's not. Rather it is not universal. I have hiked for years with my wife who has much shorter legs and a much shorter pace. I have never experienced greater exhaustion due to hiking her pace. It is possible that you are getting more tired because you are taking very slow and deliberate steps. The extra focus on your step may mean you are tensing your muscles more in order to walk a pace you are not used to. If that is the case try shortening your stride instead of walking slower. 

A little of both. You can go to your local gym or outside on routes that you feel comfortable climbing and once you get a few feet above a solid bolt or bomber piece of gear, let go. Read this article on practicing falling, and this one. Since you know you're going to fall, the fall won't feel the same as a surprise lead fall, but you can learn how to relax and react. You can continue doing this on various types of climbs (slab, crack, overhang, etc.) to get the hang of falling. After some practice, try pushing your limits (safely) on a project to get over the psychological aspect of falling. If falling is all you are thinking about when you're climbing, you won't enjoy the climb and you are much more likely to actually take a fall. 

These days I use trekking poles, which means my hands are full and thus the headlamp becomes the obvious choice. I still carry a flashlight but find that I almost never need to use it. I use a high-power LED headlamp (with lights I find that less LEDs means it is of higher quality). 

I just went on a 2 hour hike and was seriously annoyed by many insects that tried to get a bite of me. Through years of experimentation on hikes, I have so far arrived at using a 75% DEET solution that I liberally deposit over myself. While very effective after application, I find that the effect only lasts around 15 minutes - presumably due to me sweating a lot, which might have a converse effect to the repellent (just speculating, really). On today's hike, I went through 50 ml of repellent, since I had to keep reapplying it often. Is there a particular type of insect repellent that is effective in such situations? DEET has so far been the only thing I actually notice driving the insects away but I wonder if there are some more "sticky" formulations of it that might work (what I am using right now appears to just be a basic liquid solution without much additive effects). How do you cope with insects in such a case? 

From my archery days, you're primarily looking at upper arm and shoulder. Push-ups can help with that, but are pretty hard on your joints. Shoulders: $URL$ Triceps: $URL$ Biceps: $URL$ I'd be careful to intersperse these with actual draws as well, and to draw with both arms so that you don't end up off balanced. I use free weights, but I've always been leery of highly tailored workouts because unless you know exactly what you're doing you can isolate out important supporting groups. 

The simple answer is - no. Safely igniting a fire relies on controlled combustion. Improvising ignition out of a device like this is not going to create the sort of controlled combustion I associate with safety. If you can ignite the hydrogen byproduct you are more likely to get an explosive reaction that is both unsafe and unlikely to light your tinder (more likely to just blow it around). Salvaging the magnesium is safer, but you are unlikely to be able to salvage enough to start a fire (it takes more than you'd think). 

I find that the best shoelaces are the wide, flat and fairly soft ones - no special plastic coating, just canvas. They stay together the best and can take a lot of punishment. Accidental strong knots are also easier to undo, since it is easier to get a finger behind an edge due to its flatness. The ones on the picture here seem a bit too shiny, so perhaps they are coated with some layer. This is the general style I recommend, though. $URL$ 

I have always been under the impression that cotton is the enemy of a hiker - it absorbs moisture and just becomes a horrible wet casing around you, transferring away all the heat. I was therefore quite surprised to find that a new sleeping bag I had purchased actually has cotton lining. Is this not counterproductive? Or does it not matter so much, assuming I do not get into the sleeping bag all sweaty and wet? Should I take any special precautions with this bag? 

Growing up hiking the southern Appalachians, I've never actually needed a four season tent. However we are starting to look at hikes around the country where the temperatures and conditions get worse in the winter. What's a good guideline for knowing when to bring the four season tent instead of the three? 

Many of the medicines which work for ticks also work well against mosquitoes. Since you are taking your dog outdoors and will thus need flea and tick protection anyways, consider that as an option Example: $URL$ There are many brands, no preference shown other than being the easiest to find a link for. 

If it is steep enough, pat your way down with both your hands and feet. It's all about keeping everything off the wall as much as possible and not catching on anything on the way down. If it's lower angled, skip down with your feet (do not jump, just light touches). Try to keep your balance and keep your feet moving and keep your knees bent so they ease the impact along the way and when you finally come to a stop. 

Practice and experience. Find some safe projects to push your limits on. Climb routes you are comfortable on, but place one less piece of gear. The biggest thing is learning to trust yourself and your gear. As you lead more, you'll start to develop the right mindset for it. 

Did you witness or cause the incident? This is the best was to guarantee it's fresh. Is it a legal harvest? (check your states Department of Natural Resources web site) Do you know how to harvest that type of animal? 

Leaves under your tent will offer almost no value as you will crush them when you lay in your tent. The primary benefit from leaves comes from dead air space. However they will provide a more smooth and soft sleeping surface. Leaves piled around your tent will provide good insulation as long as they do not get wet. I could not find an R value, but I did manage to find this fairly realistic test using leaves for insulation. $URL$ 

I love hiking but there is a serious problem - I find it disgusting to be sweaty or dirty. I am literally unable to function properly if I do not get a thorough and warm shower every morning. This places me in a difficult position, as I do not want to give up long hikes but the discomfort is really too much for me. In the summer, a good swim every morning works OK to wash the filth off of me but there is only so much of summer and I tend to go out all year round (perhaps even more so in winter). Are there some basic tricks to keeping clean? Or do you just try to get used to the filth? To be clear, I am speaking of keeping my body clean, not so much the clothes, since those bother me less (and I can always bring a change of clothes for longer hikes).
