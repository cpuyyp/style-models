Cospectral graphs are graphs having same eigenvalues. Constructions of cospectral graph is an interesting question in graph theory. Now a days we use graph theory in different brunches of Sciences and Technology. I am looking for some applications of the idea of cospectral graph. Please provide some examples with references. 

Two graphs are said to be cospectral if they have same eigenvalues wrt adjacency matrix, Normalised or Signless laplacian matrix. How many graphs has cospectral mates for a given number of nodes? We know answer to this question when number of nodes is less than $12$. I did not see any research paper till now where author has shown any algorithmic approach to compute those statistics. Either it is too simple to say or they do not wish to disclose it. For a given number of nodes I like to compute number of graphs with at least one cospectral mate. Is there any algorithmic way to do so? If available please give me some references. Thank you for your help. 

Just a rough idea: (I am not really an expert on graph theory, so there may be a much better upper bound.) You can group the vertices according to their distance to $s$, say $L_i=\{v\in V|dist(s,v)=i\}$ Then of course the $L_i$ are pairwise disjoint. Any shortest path from $s$ to a given vertex $v$ has to pass the $L_i$ ascending (you can easily proof this fact), so first a vertex from $L_1$, then one from $L_2$, and so on. That means there are at most $\prod_{i=1}^{dist(s,v)-1}|L_i|$ shortest paths. As $|L_i|\leq |V|$, you have a polynomial upper bound. While thinking about it: There might be a way to press this bound much lower, as $|L_i|=|V|$ only happens when all vertices have distance 1, which means the shortest path is the direct connection between $s$ and $v$. For decreasing amount of vertices in the $L_i$, the possible length of the path grows. You probably could use this to get a better bound. I do not see why the rest of your algorithm should not work. 

For a given number of nodes how many non-isomorphic graphs are available? Might be this is an open problem. For less number of vertices some computational statistics available. I want to get all non-isomorphic graphs of order $5, 6, \dots 12$. Is there any complete list of all non isomorphic graphs available for a given number of nodes? If possible please give me its links or some references. If I wish to calculate it myself, which software package may be useful? 

Different labeling on a graph produces class of isomorphic graphs. Two isomorphic graphs possess similar characteristic such as connectivity, degree distribution of vertices, equality of spectrum and many others. I am looking for some properties of graph which depends particularly on vertex labeling. One such property is separability of the quantum state related to that graph. Depending on the vertex labeling two isomorphic graphs may generate different quantum states with different separability. Is there any other properties of graph which depends on vertex labeling only? 

If we write a partition $n=k_1+...+k_r$, then we can create a $(k_1,...,k_r)$-cycle in $S_n$ with order equal to the least common multiple of the $k_i$'s. It is clear that every cyclic subgroup will arise this way, by considering the cycle type of a generator. So this appears to give a classification of which cyclic subgroups can occur in $S_n$, namely $Z/mZ \hookrightarrow S_n$ iff $m$ is the lcm of numbers whose sum is $\leq n$. I'd like a (computationally at least) cleaner criterion. So... $\bullet$ What are the (orders of) maximal cyclic groups occurring in $S_n$ (under containment)? In particular, what is the largest-order cyclic subgroup in $S_n$? In light of the above, the latter question amounts to asking for a formula for the maximum value (over all partitions) of the function from partitions of $n$ to $\mathbb{N}$ which outputs the lcm of the terms in the partition. The former question asks for local maximum values (under divisibility) of this function. Statements about the partitions giving rise to these values would also be of interest. In a slightly different direction, I also wondered about the following: $\bullet$ How many different (up to iso) cyclic subgroups are in $S_n$? This is deducible from an answer to Q1 in terms of the number-of-divisors function, but I'd be interested in arguments that go a different route. 

I finally figured why the graph of my function always looks like the one above. However, it turns out that this is no general property of rank one matrices, but strongly depends on sparsity of the vectors $v_1$ and $v_2$ that in my situation always is valid. The fully formal discussion of the matter now takes about 5 pages, which I will not write down in full detail here. However, I will sketch the main idea: Let us assume $v_1=e_j$ and $v_2=e_{j'}$ where $e_i$ is the $i$-th unit vector, which is my situation. The argument below would also work for vectors that are different to zero at two identical entries. For three or more entries it is still possible, but the complexity increases exponentially. Now let $P$ a permutation matrix that exchanges the columns $j$ and $j'$ to the last two columns of $v^T_1P$ and $Pv^T_2$. Then $$ \tilde Q^T F(x)P=\tilde R P+xu_1v^T_1P+xu^T_2v^T_2P=\tilde RP+xu_1e^T_{n-1}+xu_2e^T_{n} $$ is upper triangluar everywhere but the remaining two rows. Now we can find a matrix $\hat Q$ such that $$ \hat Q\begin{bmatrix}u_1&u_2\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix} ?_n & ?_n \\ 0_{m-n} & e_1\end{bmatrix}\qquad \text{and} \qquad \hat Q\tilde R=\tilde R $$ where $?_n$ are arbitrary but known vectors in $R^n$. Then $$ \hat Q\tilde Q^T F(x)P=\tilde RP+x\hat Qu_1e^T_{n-1}+x\hat Qu_2e^T_{n} $$ only differs at two entries from upper triangular. Those entries now can be eliminated using two Givens Rotations depending on $x$. This requires some effort but is absolutely doable with symbolic reformulations. Altogether we found a $QRP$ decomposition of $F(x)$ that only depends in two Givens rotations on $x$. Evaluating the norm in my optimization problem (that is not bothered by the matrix $P$) I get a rational function with numerator and denominator of degree 2. 

I'm wondering about the following 2 generalizations of Cayley's Theorem (every group embeds in a symmetric group). If these are known to be true/false, references would be appreciated. 1) (Weak Version) Given any finite collection of (not necessarily distinct) finite groups, can we embed them simultaneously in a (finite) group so that they have pairwise-disjoint intersection (i.e., intersect only at the identity)? 2) (Strong Version) Given an arbitrary set of arbitrary groups, can we embed them simultaneously in some group so that they have pairwise-disjoint intersection? It seems like this version may run into set-theoretic difficulties; if so an explanation/reference for those would also be welcome. Note of course that if such a group exists for a given collection, then we can embed it in a symmetric group by Cayley's Theorem (so these are indeed generalizations). Edit: To make it more interesting / rule out the obvious answer pointed out in the comments, can we arrange the embeddings so that the groups' normalizers are pairwise disjoint? 

Consider a bipartite graph of order $2n$ with equal bipartitions $C_1$ and $C_2$, where, $$C_i = \{v_{i,1}, v_{i,2}, v_{i,3} \dots v_{i,n}\}; i = 1, 2.$$ Given two vertices $v_{i,p}$ and $v_{i,q}$, $Nbd(v_{i,p}, v_{i,q})$ denotes set vertices adjacent to both $v_{i,p}$ and $v_{i,q}$ with $1 \le p,q \le n$. Indexes $p$ and $q$ may or may not be equal. We denote cardinallity of $Nbd(v_{i,p}, v_{i,q})$ by $\#(Nbd(v_{i,p}, v_{i,q}))$. I want to calculate number of bipartite graphs, such that, $$\#(Nbd(v_{1,p}, v_{1,q})) = \#(Nbd(v_{2,p}, v_{2,q})) ~\forall~ p,q ~\text{with}~ 1 \le p,q \le n.$$ To construct all these graphs, I am also looking for an existing algorithm, if available. 

We regard an isomorphism of Lie groups to mean a group isomorphism which is simultaneously a diffeomorphism of the underlying smooth manifold. I'm wondering about how much rigidity is imposed by this definition. Question: If we have maps $f, g: G\rightarrow H$, where $G, H$ are Lie groups, $f$ is an abstract group isomorphism, and $g$ is a diffeomorphism, must $G$ and $H$ be isomorphic as Lie groups? I think there should be a (possibly easy) counterexample, but neither I nor the professors I've asked could immediately find one. EDIT: assume $G$ and $H$ are connected. 

Fix a finite group $G$, and let $f_G:\mathbb{N}\rightarrow\mathbb{N}$ be defined by setting $f_G(n)$ to be the largest $m$ such that $S_n$ contains $m$ disjoint (pairwise-intersecting at 1) copies of $G$. In other words, $f_G(n)$ is the optimal number of $G$'s that can be packed into $S_n$ without unnecessary overlap. Clearly $f_G$ starts with a string of zeros, monotonically increases and is unbounded. It would seem spectacularly ambitious to actually compute this function for $G$ remotely complicated. Q1 - Does $f_G$ determine $G$? In case the affirmative does hold generally, I'd also be curious to know if a stronger result is true: Q2 - Does there necessarily exist an $n$ (depending on $G$) such that $f_G(n)\neq f_{H}(n)$ for all $H$ distinct from $G$? In other words, can we be assured that a finite amount of computation would be sufficient to distinguish $G$ from all other finite groups? An affirmative answer to Q2 would mean that $G$ is classified by a pair of (hopefully computable) integers. Both answers are affirmative for groups of (very) small order since they're the only ones that even fit in the first few symmetric groups, but I don't see any hope to prove/disprove them in general. 

Now I wonder if there is something like an inverse of this theorem. Suppose I know that all roots are contained within a circle of radius $r$. Is there anything that can be said about the maximum coefficient, i.e. $$ \max |p_i|\leq \text{some function of }r? $$ I would also be graceful for a counter example. 

Suppose I have a polynomial $$ p(x)=\sum_{i=0}^n p_ix^i. $$ For simplicity furthermore assume $p_n=1$. As it is well known we may use Gershgorin circles to give an upper bound for the absolute values of the roots of $p(x)$. The theorem states that all roots are contained within a circle with radius $$ r=\max\{|p_0|, 1+|p_1|,\ldots, 1+|p_{n-1}|\}. $$
