Yes, it’s possible. Is it possible for the vast majority of people? No. Is it beneficial? No. How long would it take? 52 hours at a pace of 2.5 minutes per 100 meters. Here is one guy that could do it. $URL$ 

Without knowing more, it’s hard to say, but it would seem as though you need to challenge yourself more. Either add weight to the plank, or modify the body weight version (or both). To modify, you could do a wall plank or mountain climbers as two examples. 

Yes, but again, so could any type of training. The reason being is that the muscles will get bigger and stronger from training. 

Actually, I have a similar problem, and I have asked about related things erlier on this site - check those questions out (deadlifts with hyperlordosis). I also consulted a friend who studied physical theraphy. She gave me a bit of advice: 

Ive read that there are several types of endurance. One of them is the so called strength endurance, defined as 

This may sound like advice applicable only to children, but frankly, that's not the case... Make it fun For most people, starting a training schedule is a tough decision - they put on a Rambo-style bandana and grind their teeth while thinking "this is pain but I will do this!". We both know such an attitude wont let them stick to their training plan. Instead, you could start off with any kind of activity that could be fun for them. I had some friends that never-ever would have gone with me to the gym. But I asked one to go with me and play some squash. The other got hooked on indoor rockclimbing. The third one seemed to enjoy our trips to the swimming pool. Now they actively ask me to join them! Some of them started running with me - and they are enjoyibng it! If I said in the beginning "come running with me" Id get a "hell no!" answer. All in all, it starts with making it so that they want to be active. If you can achieve that, the hard work is done. If they want it, they usually find the time and the motivation. If exercising is a chore, then they wont get too far. I had several attempts at getting fit earlier, and all of them failed, when I was trying to get to a weightlifting or running training plan right off the bat. But I found some fun activities, played some squash, climbed, tried some fencing... And once I got the feeling that getting tired can be kinda fun and helps me regenerate after a day at the desk at work much better than sitting in front of my computer at home, starting to run with my friend every other or third day became a lot easier. To sum it up In my humble opinion, if the goal is general fitness and health, there is no need for a specific program. Just find an activity that you all enjoy and start doing that, more and more frequently and regularly. Motivation and having fun is crucial to sticking to any form of physical activity. 

No. You actually should breathe through mouth while swimming. When your left shoulder is on top, move your head to right while breating. 

I bought an elliptical cycle to lose weight. After losing some weight and getting used to it now it feels as easy as walking. It is basically useless now. But I don't want it to go to waste. So I'm looking for a way to make it useful for my workout. Can I increase its resistance by modifying it somehow? Would wearing a 40lbs rucksack while using it a good idea? PS: This is the cycle I have. It has 11-pound magnetic flywheel, which is why it is so easy I think. 

Ive read that most climbers have a lot of muscle imbalances, including some that affect proper posture. 

Most likely, it isnt worth it. 129$ a month is a really BIG pile of money. While it is possbile that the recovery drink you are taking helps with recovery, it surely helps in a marginal way. The three most important factors about recovery after a training are: 

Studies (like this one $URL$ show that stretching does not prove to be useful before training at all. To quote a commentary on the study i linked: 

Some even say that stretching pre-workout lowering your max performance in strength training! I cant find those studies right now, but If you ask me, science says that stretching pre-exercise does not help prevent injuries or limit the DOMS one may experience after the workout. So for the sake of your question, because we cant prove that stretching is useful, we can skip even without checking if it actually has some negative side effects, like Jillian Michaels suggests (and Im pretty sure it does). This goes for pre and post-workout stretching, not stretching as a standalone. Im stretching too, but it serves diferent goals (I have too tight pectoral muscles and need to stretch them to help maintain good posture). I do both static and dynamic stretches to increase my range of motion and accustom some of my overtightened muscles to being in the neutral state, but I do it on non training days and in the morning. Also, remember to do a proper warmup before doing any streneous exercises - warmups have been proven to be beneficial! 

You could eat almost anything (on a caloric deficit) and drop bodyfat. If you are reaching your macronutrient and micronutrient goals, that will help even more. If your abs haven’t grown enough though, you won’t see them even at lower body fat percentages. Find a “TDEE Calculator” (google), do 200-500 less calories than what your TDEE is, and you’ll drop bodyfat. If you want to build muscle, try getting 1.5-2 times your kg body weight in grams of protein AND keep your calorie deficit at 200 or less than your TDEE. 

First of all, it depends on how close you are to your maximum muscle potential. By that, I am referring to the maximum amount of muscle that you could potentially (naturally) carry on your frame according to your individual genetics. Refer to FFMI to roughly determine this. The closer you are to that, the less likely that simultaneous fat loss/muscle gain will be possible. $URL$ Second, if you stay in a positive nitrogen balance (usually by eating enough protein) and you eat enough calories to maintain your weight (total weight), then it is possible, but expect slower results on both fronts. If you are young and you still have plenty of muscle potential left, then you have quite a bit more wiggle room than older folks who are closer to their maximum potential, but it is very much possible. Third, is it desirable? You could eat in a slight surplus (gaining 0-0.5 lbs a week) and have an excellent lean bulk if your goal is to put on muscle. You’ll gain more muscle mass this way, but how much more? There is no scientific answer for that. It could very well be marginal at best. So while you would put on “more” muscle almost definitely, the actual percentage might be underwhelming in the face of looking at having to lose weight down the line. On the other hand, it might be a significant number. There are too many variables at play. Regardless ANY kind of bulk will definitely grant faster muscle building, the exact amount just isn’t clear. Fourth, decide what is important to you and what isn’t. Decide on the path based on that. Both paths will take a lot of time. One path gets to higher muscle mass quicker, but at the cost of additional fat. The other path comes at the cost of being more strict with yourself (finding that ideal personal balance). Whatever you choose, I wish you luck! Edit - One thing I didn’t mention that is also important to this whole thing is your body fat percentage. If your BF% is low (12 or under) you’ll probably want to simply focus on a lean bulk rather than weight maintenance through fat loss and muscle gain. From what I understand of your question, you’re probably somewhere around here. I already explained the lean bulk in the third paragraph, so there’s no need to repeat that but, but let’s talk about how it correlates to body fat. If you don’t have a lot of body fat to lose, then your (overall) weight will almost need to increase when you put on additional muscle due to the additional weight of the muscle itself. This is a good thing, but keep in mind that not everything you gain will necessarily be muscle. Typically, a man will be able to add 1-2 pounds of muscle to his frame per month under good-ideal conditions. Therefore, if you gain more than that, it’s easy to gauge what may be muscle and what may be fat. 

A while ago I started working towards making my first pullup - I have been doing negatives for quite some time. Recently I decided Ill try to make a pullup, and I did. Over the course of a week or two I got to doing 3-4 pullups in a row, depending on how good a day Im having. Recently I have been experiencing paint at my wrists. I cant really pinpoint situations in which it hurts, but it tends to be when im using force to keep the wrist straight or when there is a shock to it (for example, throwing a punch at a bag). Im thinking my tendons and joints might not be ready for the challenges I present to them with my pullups. What should I do? Should I take a break from pullups? Should I wrap my wrists? Should I go see a doctor? How to prepare my wrists for future exercise? 

The only way to determine progress is by having a point of reference. Doing two similar exercises, one at an earlier point in time and the other later doesn’t provide a good point of reference. However, doing the same exercise is a good point of reference. While it might not seem like a big difference, “same” and “similar” can give very different results when using them as points of reference. Therefore, the best way to determine progress is by repeating your point of reference. 

You’ll want something beeping for you while this is happening so you don’t have to stare at your phone and for that I would suggest a free app called “IntervalTimer”. Of course, there are many other ways to have something to let you know when to switch between intervals, but that’s just my suggestion. ... On the nutrition side of things, make sure you get enough protein (1.5-2x your kg weight throughout the day) and calcium to help give your muscles and bones what they need. You could also try supplementing with creatine as it helps to further strengthen the muscles and provide energy. 

I'm researching about how to increase BMR efficiently. (Note that BMR, not TDEE) I want to increase mine by 100% in the long term. How can I do that? A way is increasing muscle obvisously. Also we see people whose metabolism is faster than usual. They don't move much but they are always skinny even if they eat a lot! I'm sure there are tons of variables relevant but maybe there is something we could replicate or develop to be similar to them. Any ideas about this? 

I do cardio in the morning with empty stomach due to work. I find it very difficult to go on after 30 mins. I'm 100kg m 23. HR: 160. Elliptical cycle level 8/8. Daily intake: 1500. BMR: 1700. Desk job and 30 mins cardio everyday. 

Im starting a bit of indoor climbing, but Im not sure Im commited enough to buy climbing shoes - they are quite costly. Still, my running shoes seem to be a poor choice for climbing, I can only use the biggest footholds available. Are there any types of regular footwear that would do better for climbing, or do I have to buy dedicated shoes? 

Muscle building exercises increase your BMR in the sense that they let you build up more muscle. Each kilogram of muscle-mass needs a certain amount of energy to be maintained through the day. Any routine that increases your muscle mass will help increase your BMR. There are also exercises triggering the so called afterburn effect, see the Tabata protocol and High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) But all in all, dont get too excited about increasing your BMR. Its very hard to increase energy expenditure to a level that affects how much you can eat without putting on weight. If you think that a bit of excercise is a get out of jail card for overeating, think again.
