The answer is no, the group von Neumann algebra of the Burnside group $B(2,665)$ does not have property Gamma. In fact, $B(2,665)$ is not inner amenable. To see this, first note that, as pointed out in the question, $B(2,665)$ is nonamenable, and the centralizer of every non-identity element of $B(2,665)$ is finite. However, every nonamenable inner amenable group $G$ contains a non-identity element whose centralizer is nonamenable. This is a consequence of applying the following well-known folklore lemma to the conjugation action of $G$ on $G-1$: Lemma: if an action of a nonamenable group $G$ on a set $X$ admits an invariant finitely additive probability measure $\mu$, then there is a point $x\in X$ whose stabilizer subgroup $G_x$ is nonamenable. There are a variety of proofs of this Lemma. Here is a standard averaging argument: Suppose that every $G_x$ is amenable. Let $X_0\subset X$ contain one point from each $G$-orbit and for $x\in X_0$ let $\nu _x$ be a finitely additive probability measure on $G$ which is invariant under left translation by $G_x$. Then $x\mapsto \nu _x$ extends to a well-defined assignment on all of $X$ by taking $\nu _{g\cdot x} = g\cdot \nu _x$ for $x\in X_0$, $g\in G$. The barycenter $\nu = \int _X \nu _x \, d\mu (x)$ is then invariant under left translation by $G$, so $G$ is amenable, contrary to the hypothesis of the lemma. 

An FC-group is a group in which every element has a finite conjugacy class. A group G is said to be maximally almost periodic if there is an injective homomorphism from G into a compact Hausdorff group. My question is whether every discrete countable FC-group G is maximally almost periodic. In general an FC-group G is isomorphic to a subgroup of the direct product of a locally finite FC-group and a torsionfree abelian group. Since discrete abelian groups are maximally almost periodic, this reduces the general question to the case where G is additionally assumed to be locally finite. 

The image of $\Lambda_2$ in $G/\Lambda_1$ is finite. Take a set of representatives $s_1, s_2, \ldots s_n$ in $\Lambda_2$. Now consider $\cup s_i F_2$. I claim this is a Borel fundamental domain for $F_1$. It is Borel as it is a finite union of Borel sets. Let $g\Lambda_1$ be a coset of $\Lambda_1$. Then $g\Lambda_2$ intersects $F_2$ in a single point $x$. Now, $\Lambda_2 = \cup s_i \Lambda_1$, and so $x$ is in some $s_i$ translate of $F_2$, and hence in $F_1$. It is unique as otherwise we have $s_i \lambda_1 = s_j \lambda_1'$, which would mean our set of representatives was too big in the first place. 

Sato-Tate has a much more general form in random matrix theory stating that the Satake parameters are distributed as the eigenvalues of some random matrix in a compact Lie group related to the Zariski closure of the image of the associated Galois representation. The measure is just the Haar measure on that group. This applies to abelian representations, and recovers Hecke's equidistribution result. 

Numerical Recipes, 3rd edition, Chapter 3 describes a vast number of interpolation methods with source code. It seems from what you are telling us that something is confused in the paper: Chebyshev interpolation has to do with picking points at which to minimize error of the ensuing result, but perhaps something else was meant/the usage is slightly different. 

Let $K$ be an abelian extension of $\mathbb{Q}$. We know that $[x, K]|_{\mathrm{Gal}{\mathbb{Q}^{ab}}}=[\mathrm{N}^{K}_{\mathbb{Q}} x, \mathbb{Q}]$ where $[x, F]$ is the Artin reciprocity map. Given a modulus $\mathfrak{m}$ of $K$, we get a modulus $\mathrm{N}^{K}_{\mathbb{Q}} \mathfrak{m}$. While I can write down abstractly how the Galois groups of the corresponding ray class fields are related, I don't know how the fields are related: will they embed in an easily understood manner? 

The paper by Kazhdan and Lusztig "A topological approach to Springer representation" may provide an answer to the question at the end of the post on an explicit form of Springer representation. Also, I think this question is related to Lusztig's homomorphism from the Hecke algebra $H$ to the asymptotic Hecke algebra $J$. To simplify the statement, assume $G=SL(n)$ (as the author of the question does). Then the matrix of the Springer representation in the canonical basis in the top homology of Springer fiber can be read off that homomorphism (specialized at $q=1$): the algebra $J$ in this case is a sum of matrix algebras, taking the summand corresponding to the given nilpotent we get the answer. The homomorphism is rather explicit, so this answer is as explicit as the canonical basis is. 

Is there a theorem (or theorems) that can be thought of a real analogue of Weil conjectures? One can replace the finite field by real numbers and Frobenius by complex conjugation; counting points can perhaps be replaced by Euler characteristic or a more refined invariant of the set of real points. Of course, Lefschetz fixed point formula can be applied here, but is there something more specific one can say? 

Is there an analogue of Kac-Weisfeiler conjecture (a theorem of Premet) on the power of p dividing dimension of an irreducible representation for Lie algebras of Cartan type? Benkart and Feldvoss mention this as an open problem (Problem 10) in their 2015 survey, but they don't seem to state a precise conjecture. 

Let $G$ be a complex simple simply connected algebraic group and $Gr_G$ be the corresponding affine Grassmannian (it is well known that $Gr_G$ is homotopy equivalent to the base loop space $\Omega K$ of the maximal compact subgroup $K\subset G$). Let $H=H^*(Gr,k)=H^*(\Omega K,k)$ be the cohomology ring where $k$ is a field of characteristic $p>0$. The computation of $H$ by Yun and Zhu in their paper "Integral homology of loop groups..." shows that the commutative $k$-algebra $H$ has a divided power structure, at least when $p$ is not too small. Can this be seen from first principles? In particular, is it related to Cartan's divided power structure on homology of a commutative simplicial $k$-algebra? 

Conway and Sloane, as well as Cassels, and also O'Meara, all have their own idiosyncratic way of expressing the following result (for good primes): Every quadratic form with coefficients in $\mathbb{Z}_p$ is equivalent by a change of variables with coefficients $\mathbb{Z}_p$ to one expressible as $\oplus_{i} p^{e_i}h(\epsilon_i, m_i)$, where $h(\epsilon_i, m_i)$ is $y_1^2+y_2^2+\ldots+y_{m_i}^2$ if $\epsilon_i=0$, and $y_1^2+y_2^2+\ldots+ry_{m_i}^2$ with $r$ a quadratic nonresidue if $\epsilon_i=1$. Furthermore there is a quadratic form $f$ over the integers with given local components $f_i$ if and only if the compatibility conditions for rational equivalence are satisfied. In the case of rational equivalence this has been given an effective treatment by Kirschmer and a coauthor whose name escapes me right now: given a discriminant and a list of primes where the form should have negative Hasse-Witt invariant, they compute a quadratic form. What I would like is a function that given a discriminant (as an integer), and a list of local components, computes a quadratic form in the given genus, i.e. computes the form $f$ described above. 

Let $G$ and $H$ be groups over the ring of integers $R$ of a local field $F$ with finite residue characteristic $p$. Suppose we have a surjection $\phi$ from $G(F)$ to $H(F)$, and another surjection $\bar{\phi}$ from $G(k)$ to $H(k)$. Is this enough to conclude the image of a parahoric in $G$ is a parahoric in $H$? 

Let $L/\mathbb{Q}$ be a Galois closed field with Galois group a subgroup of $S_6$. Is it the case that $L$ is the compositum of Galois closures of linearly disjoint fields of degree at most $6$ over $\mathbb{Q}$? Currently this looks true from a bashing argument: taking each subgroup of $S_6$ up to isomorphism and either noting it is a direct product, or it has a large subgroup which is not normal and whose normalizer is the whole subgroup. Bashing argument isn't complete yet, so this might still be false. I'd like something more elegant though, and if it works for $S_n$ even better. 

The answer is yes: every infinite finitely generated group has a subset which is equidecomposable to a proper subset of itself. This follows from a theorem of Brandon Seward: Every finitely generated infinite group $G$ admits a translation-like action by the group $\mathbb{Z}$ of integers. $URL$ What this means is that there exists a free action of $\mathbb{Z}$ on $G$ such that each element of $\mathbb{Z}$ acts as an element of the wobbling group of $G$. That is, there exists a bijection $f:G\rightarrow G$ having no finite orbits, along with a finite partition $G=\bigsqcup_{i=1}^nX_i$ and finitely many group elements $a_1,\dots , a_n\in G$ such that $f(x)=a_ix$ for all $x\in X_i$. If we take $T$ to be a subset of $G$ containing exactly one point from each orbit, and define $A$ to be the set $A = \bigsqcup _{n\geq 0} f^n(T)$, then $f(A)$ is a proper subset of $A$, and the partition $A=\bigsqcup _{i=1}^n A_i$, where $A_i := A\cap X_i$, along with the group elements $a_1,\dots , a_n$, witness that $A$ is equidecomposable with $f(A)$. Edit: I realized there is also a simple direct argument which also shows that $n$ is bounded above by the minimum size of a finite subset $S$ of $G$ which generates an infinite subsemigroup of $G$. Consider the (left) Cayley graph of this subsemigroup $H$ with respect to its generating set $S$, i.e., with vertex set $H$ and with a directed edge from $h$ to $sh$ for each $s\in S$ and $h\in H$. This graph is infinite and locally finite, so by KÅ‘nig's lemma it contains an infinite geodesic ray, say with vertices $h_0,h_1,\dots$. Let $A := \{ h_0,h_1,h_2,\dots \}$ and let $B=A \setminus \{ h_0 \}$. For each $n\geq 0$ there is some $s_n\in S$ such that $h_{n+1}=s_nh_n$, so $A$ is partitioned into finitely many sets $A_s$, $s\in S$, where $A_s$ consists of those $h_n$ for which $s_n=s$. Then $B$ is partitioned by $sA_s$, $s\in S$, so $A$ and $B$ are equidecomposable. 

The group $SL(2,F)$ where $F$ is a local nonArchemidian field is hyperbolic. Various generalizations of the notion of hyperbolicity have been studied in the literature (I've seen terms like "hierarchically hyperbolic", "relatively hyperbolic" etc.). Which of those classes do groups of the form $G(F)$ where $G$ is semi-simple of higher rank fall into? 

It's a toric variety, for which intersection cohomology is computed algorithmically, see e.g. De Catldo's lectures. 

Let $X$ be a smooth closed subvariety in a complex projective space and $Z\subset X$ be a generic hyperplane section. Lefschetz hyperplane section Theorem says that the restriction map $H^i(X)\to H^i(Z)$ is an isomorphism for $i<dim(Z)$ and injective for $i=dim(Z)$. I am interested in examples when it's also an isomorphism $i=dim(Z)$. This is equivalent to saying that Fourier-Deligne transform of the intersection cohomology sheaf of the cone over $X$ has less than full support in the dual space (then this support has to be the cone over the projectively dual variety $X^*$). This is so when $X$ is an even dimensional quadric; are there other examples? 

Does Hochschild cohomology of a cocommutative Hopf algebra over a field of positive characteristic have a natural divided power structure? If not, perhaps a certain natural extra structure on the Hopf algebra would yield one? 

The previous answer may be all you need, but, say, in question one one can also proceed by induction in q, to make the step of induction embed your complex into an acyclic complex of injective objects. 

Is every vector bundle on an algebraic torus $T=({\mathbb A}^1\setminus \{0\})^n$ over an algebraically closed field trivial? I am primarily interested in the case of a characteristic zero base field. 

A commutative analogue of the conjecture that the only projective D-affine varieties are homogeneous spaces is a generalization of Harthshorne conjecture. The latter (famously proved by Mori) characterizes projective spaces as the only smooth projective varieties with ample tangent bundles. It is expected that the only smooth projective varieties whose tangent bundle is big and nef are homogeneous spaces of reductive groups, this conjecture is apparently due to Demailly and Campana-Peternell.
