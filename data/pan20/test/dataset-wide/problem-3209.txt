Dante clearly expected his audience to know who these people were. Which tells you that as of about 1300AD, people had some smattering of knowledge - and not just the educated monks, but the general audience that Dante was writing in vulgar Italian for. Dante assumed the burghers knew not just of the names of the philosophers, but a bit about their most influential ideas. We can only guess how much of this written literature was influenced by the oral literature of the era, or how it seeped into the oral culture that followed. But Dante wrote in verse for a reason - it was written to be read aloud and perhaps to be memorized and passed on orally. It seems hard to imagine that Dante's works were isolated from the oral literature of the time. 

I would posit that such booms and rushes are not the exception but the norm, and there is more to be learned from the study of them than from mere war and politics. The effects of the latter are comparatively easily (and often, quickly) reversed, while the effects of booms and rushes usually reverberate for generations. Some examples: 

The list goes on and on and it's a very worthwhile area of study. One of the fundamental questions of economics is the extent to which global economic growth is driven by this sort of exogenous exploitation, as opposed to internal growth and invention. Obviously this question is intertwined with serious moral and political issues. 

No, but people truly thought they were. Any reading of medieval sources shows us that Medieval folk truly believed that their society was structured by God. They weren't completely naive and knew that their institutions were imperfect, but they were confident that whatever deviations there were from the ideal were temporary and would be put right by the next king, emperor, or pope. If all you read is the literature and historical accounts, you might easily conclude that the simplistic feudal model so often depicted in modern movies and books was real. But any examination of source documents - tax records, muster rolls, private correspondence, and such - reveals a much more complex reality. So much so that many scholars today reject the term "feudalism" altogether. That might be a bit extreme, but at the very least the term deserves reexamination - for example, in the book "Fiefs and Vassals, The Medieval Evidence Reinterpreted", by Susan Reynolds. ($URL$ The reality was this: medieval society lacked the material sophistication for rulers to fully order their realms. Communications were too slow, literacy too rare, institutions too weak, and national identities too ephemeral for any sort of political system to be effective. Rulers were constantly forced to take ad hoc measures, and their subjects took advantage of the countless gaps in the social structure to advance their own interests. Titles, offices, and even laws could not be assumed to be effective. I suspect that it is due to this extraordinary amount of uncertainty in medieval society that people were so willing - perhaps desperate - to believe that the feudal system was really at work, ordering the current society and just waiting to be perfected by the next Charlesmagne or King Arthur. So, No, armies (and other instruments of power) weren't truly organized by a coherent model. They were constantly in flux, based on not just the factors that are suggested in the question but religious ideals, mercenary motives, dynastic considerations, and especially the personalities of the leaders. 

As heretical as this sounds . . . the Inquisition. Of course this sounds completely counter-intuitive, as the crimes prosecuted by inquisitors were slippery, to say it mildly, and the "evidence" could be as ephemeral as cobwebs. However, it is precisely because of this that the Inquisition revolutionized the way trials were handled. Most of what we associate with a proper trial was either invented or popularized by the Inquisition. That includes proper trial transcripts, professional officers of the law, "modern" ideas of evidence, and limitations on torture. (On the last point, understand that the common opinion of the time was that you could not trust a statement that wasn't made under torture. The manuals given to inquisitors are among the few documents of the era that instructed otherwise.) There are several reasons why the Inquisition had such a tremendous impact on legal proceedings. The crimes being prosecuted were problematic for the conventional courts - the issues were often subtle and the verdicts often had major political and social ramifications. Many prosecutions involved difficult points of church doctrine, beyond the capacity of an ordinary feudal court to analyze. A verdict reached too casually could inflame a riot (or even a war ) - "heretic" and "rebel" were often all-but synonymous in a milieu where kings were assumed to be blessed by the divine. The Inquisition itself was extra-territorial, with avenues of appeal leading all the way to Rome. Thus there was a lot of pressure on the inquisitors to develop iron-clad verdicts based on unimpeachable evidence, properly documented and derived in a consistent, professional manner. Of course, it took centuries to develop and was not always successful. It should not be surprising that over time, the haphazard civil court systems of Europe would be deeply influenced by the much more sophisticated inquisitions. Standards for how courts were run, transcripts kept, appeals heard, and testimony obtained, inevitably improved in imitation of the evolving model. In time (mostly the 17th century) the law codes were updated to reflect the new procedures and the ideas that motivated them, and the form of our modern court systems were solidified. 

$URL$ Cotton began to become much more common after c.700AD as its cultivation spread and over the subsequent centuries it became increasingly available and inexpensive. Still, it was still a luxury good when it was introduced to European markets in the 15th century. Flax, on the other hand, lends itself easily to mass production and has always been among the cheapest fibers used by man. At the time of the Nabataeans, it would have been the obvious choice for sails. 

Well, it isn't exactly true that medieval scholars understood the world to be round. They were much, much more subtle in their thinking that that. You see, it was quite clear that the world couldn't be precisely round, and much of their thinking went into improving that model. To see why the medieval view was much more subtle than authors like Lyon even seem to imagine, you have to understand that the roundness of the Earth was intimately tied to the medieval understanding of the workings of gravity. Of course, in this era no one was close to anticipating anything like Newtonian gravitation. Indeed, they would have considered ridiculous the idea that two bodies could act on each other without some physical connection. (Note: Newton's theory was not broadly accepted as a physical model for decades after publication for the same reason. Newton barely even tried to explain how gravity actually worked. Newton's math, of course, was accepted and celebrated, but scientists struggled for years to come up with a mechanism that allowed for what appeared to be "action at a distance".) Instead of Newtonian gravity, the Aristotelian thought common in the Middle Ages held that objects rose or fell according to their elements in a kind of sorting process, all things tending to the center of the universe (that is, Earth). Objects made of Earth had the strongest affinity for the center, followed by water, then air, then fire. Thus the Universe is more-or-less a set of concentric spheres, with Earth at the center, surrounded by Water, then Air, then Fire. And every substance naturally seeks it's proper level. This model is quite sensible - most of our everyday observations of rocks, water, bubbles and such seem to confirm it, and what few counterexamples exist can be explained away more-or-less convincingly. (You might notice that Copernicus' solar-centric model contradicts this model, and Copernicus failed to provide even a cursory explanation of how his system could work. Putting a fiery body at the center of the system quite literally turns the universe upside-down. Copernicus' math may have been excellent, but lacking a theory of gravity, his physics were absurd.) So medieval scholars not only understood the world to be round, they had a fully developed physical theory of gravity which demanded that the world was round. Lyon could not have been more wrong - the roundness of the Earth was central to the entire understanding of how the Universe worked. But scholars knew that there was a problem with this entire worldview - indeed, the problem was right beneath their feet. The riddle they struggled with was simple: how can there be dry land? The general expectation was that there were similar (if not exactly the same) amounts of earth, air, fire and water in the universe. But if there were similar amounts of earth and water, and the earth was (almost) entirely closer to the center than the water, then the water layer should be very thick and there should be not a bit of dry land poking above this layer. Scholars provided many different theories to explain this, all of which required some deviation from the simplistic statement that the world was round. They considered the possibility that the water-sphere had a different center than the earth-sphere, that the earth-sphere was egg-shaped, and other alternatives. The one explanation that seems to have completely eluded them is that there isn't nearly as much water as earth, and that the water just forms a thin shell on the surface. This theory quietly became universal within a few decades of Columbus' discoveries, almost without debate. In sum, medieval scholars weren't all ignorant rubes that thought the world was round. They knew the world was much more complicated than that!
