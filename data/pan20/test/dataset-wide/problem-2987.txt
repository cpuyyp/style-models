And on and on. In any case, it is simply not true that the dark forest solution is the only one. The Federation of Planets model (Star Trek) is a good alternative: mutual agreements for defence, so if anyone tries to be a dark hunter, the entire federation is alerted and can either evade or squash the hunter. (Space is big, so it will take a really long time for this to play out.) Big predators on earth have an alternate "agreement": packs of wolves don't attack bears much (or vice versa) because both sides stand to lose a lot in the conflict. Two powers will damage each other badly if they fight; it's far better to work out a way to avoid fighting. Also, physics don't really work out for dark hunters to exist. If a civilization is spacefaring, the chance that you can catch everyone is just about exactly zero. Earth is vulnerable to an asteroid or something, but escaping is incredibly easy because you simply accelerate and wait, and you're pretty much invisible for arbitrarily long. Unless you as a dark hunter can move at the speed of light, your prey is going to get away. So I just don't think there's any deep problem here. (Not a deep philosophical problem, anyway.) 

Eating your own species is a bad idea from a health perspective since any parasites (prions, etc.) that affected the other individual could well affect you, and any toxins they accumulated that were bad for them are also bad for you. (Since cannibalism has not been frowned upon strongly enough in all societies there is a fairly recent example of this.) Thus, consequentialist ethical systems should oppose cannibalism for pragmatic reasons, assuming starvation is not an issue. I'm not sure there is a succinct way to consider non-consequentialist positions. Cannibalism aside from starvation or murder is sufficiently rare that I've not seen it garner much attention. 

where is the stored energy and is the entropy. Any reaction where is negative will proceed--which could occur because entropy goes up, or could because energy is released (heating up the surroundings). If there is no way to vent the heat, then overall entropy will go up (because of the temperature term increasing, which will also increase ; the direct dependence of on is not shown in this equation which assumes is held constant), but any system that can lose heat to the outside--and that's basically any chemical reaction--can power its way to lower entropy by expending enough energy. A canonical example of an exothermic () entropy-reducing reaction is crystallization. Solids essentially always have lower entropy than liquids. (This goes for phase changes from gas to liquid and liquid to solid, also.) But there are plenty of other examples; any reaction which reduces the number of molecules also tends to be entropy-reducing (even burning hydrogen: 2H2 + O2 -> 2H2O converts three molecules to two). Bottom line: local reduction in entropy is not in the least exclusive to life; it is a general property of chemical systems which do not trap all heat that they produce. 

Whether or not it is stealing is a semantic question (or a legal one--but we know the answer there). It is an instance of one person doing something that another wishes that they had paid for, and where things are set up such that some third parties are paying. Thus, there is some inequality in benefit received for a given expenditure, and this inequality is decided by the beneficiary. In cases where equal expenditures are customary, this would be called "stealing" (even though in the case of music, "stealing" does not actually take away anything from anybody except for the potential revenue of a purchase). In cases where no expenditure is customary, those paying would be called "donors" (and the payment would be a donation or gift). Of course, those who wish to sell music are particularly keen on stressing the "stealing" part, and those who wish to consume it and do not feel particularly generous are particularly keen on stressing the opposite. I don't think the question is entirely settled; I think the music industry has done an effective job at associating the word "stealing" with not paying for music, but as far as I can tell this has in part simply diluted the meaning of the word "stealing" towards meaning "free" without meaning "wrong". Whether or not it is wrong depends in part on your particular view of morality. If you are a consequentialist, you may note that it is not clear that creative works which have close to zero reproduction cost are optimized by a free market wherein those works can be restricted by their creator (or corporate representatives thereof). Correcting this by taking matters into your own hands and downloading a bunch of songs for free is rather dubious (given the very high likelihood that your judgment will be distorted by self-interest), but it's not clear that this is the best model as opposed to, for example, a work-for-hire model where musical artists would perform songs and those would be freely available; if they became at all popular, people could pay them to create more (schemes to do this with many small individual contributions are now feasible given the internet). Would this result in greater overall happiness (or whatever other standard one used as a consequentialist)? I don't think we know. I do think it would be very difficult to find out experimentally, since the current system leaves e.g. the recording industry with an enormous amount of revenue, which can and is used to boost popularity, which drives demand for their not-freely-available-but-zero-cost-to-replicate product. It is wrong to benefit from something while destroying it, even as a consequentialist, unless you can somehow derive so much benefit that it offsets all the lost benefit to everyone else (and yourself) who has to live with the lack-of-whatever-it-was in the future. This almost never is the case, so to argue that copying music is not wrong (in some general case), one does have to have a plausible mechanism by which this would not destroy the industry. (Arguing that, for example, you want more indie music, which can be supported by local live performances, while downloading reams of Spears, Bieber, and Gaga, is not a very compelling argument. You cannot destroy pop music by downloading it because you hate it (since there is no cost to the artists), only if you and others would otherwise have bought it and this destroys their revenue stream.) 

Your point about the usefulness of 'higher level' descriptions is one addresed by Paul Churchland very early on in the history of Eliminative Materialism, and constitutes a position known as functionalism, the origins of which probably lie with Wilfrid Sellars: 

For Deleuze, the universe consists of infinitely many forms appearing and dissappearing at infinite speeds ('chaos' or 'chaosmos'). Science uses measurement to help us deal with the utterly incomprehensible chaos (hence the 'Kantian aspec') by slowing it down: 

In other words, Churchland would say you are wrong in claiming that mental states are 'useful'. He points out that there are many limitations and flaws to the theory, that from a scientific perspective render it not very useful. Churchland calls this approach 'functionalism', and compares it to those who argued that Alchemy was a useful abstraction and not an ontological theory, and so it shouldn't be replaced by chemistry. He summarizes: 

So to answer your question, Deleuze might say that the requirement for measuring (and he would be pleased that this question is indeed a Kantian question) is precisely the limit: 

Leaving aside the issue of the definition of 'philosophical logic', I think that the most famous book about it is the Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus of Wittgenstein. A touch-stone for Analytic philosophers and other kinds of pony-tailed pedants. 

The quotes are taken from this paper: Elimanitve Materialism and the Propositional Attitudes By Paul Churchland. I recommend reading that for a more satisfying answer to your question. To answer the question directly, you ask: 

Because your definition of philosophy ("philosophy is defined by its method, which is based on logical analysis.") is not widely (or at least not unanimously) held. So, existentialism is considered philosophy by those with a different definition of philosophy than yourself. An example of a concept of philosophy that is explicitly opposed to your own can be found, I believe, in Deleuze & Guattari's Qu'est-ce que la philosophie? ('what is philosophy?'). Here is a passage from the chapter 'Prospects and Concepts' taken from the English translation by Burchell and Tomlinson: 

You describe with dazzling precision the exact difference between the two positions. And so you ask a further question (I take it to be the real question): Isn't this a word game?. I suppose that it is, in the same way that the statements "the Earth is round" and "the Earth is flat" differ only as part of a mere 'word-game', if that refers simply to the fact that 'round' and 'flat' are words. 

The act of 'measuring', limiting or slowing down is something that the philosopher Gilles Deleuze has written about quite extensively. He seems to have inherited this particular concept from Leibniz, who is in some ways the inventor of the limit (which, as you correctly note, is the ground for the possiblity of measurement), and who also wrote quite a bit on the subject. It also takes on a Kantian aspect in Deleuze (like most of his concepts), whose Critique of Pure Reason (in particular the chapter 'Transcendental Aesthetic') can also be seen as a meditation on the idea of measurement (for Kant, space [and therefore measurement] is no longer a relation [e.g. between bodies] as it is in Leibniz, but the form of appearances itself). According to Deleuze, measuring (although its not a term he uses himself, nor does it appear to have any significance in English translations of his work) is the defining gesture of science and scientific thought, and is related to the primary functives of science (functives are the things which a scientific function is made of, and functions are the objects of science): 

This is unsound and invalid. At least one of the premises is false (P1) Socrates may be a woman (we only have Plato's word otherwise) and even if both premises were correct, there is nothing to infer that being a woman makes one mortal. This is an entire field of study in itself with a lot of bearing on Mathematics. If you are interested, check out Matt dilahunty's YouTube video Foundations 1.0 on the Logical Absolutes for a beginners guide. 

OK, after wading through some of Karen Barad's work I'll give this a shot. I'll put a disclaimer right here that this is largely educated guesswork. As the OP says, Karen's writing style is very opaque, especially when she leaves off a direct discussion of her field of expertise (quantum physics) and starts trying to apply physics to sociology. Barad proposes a theory she calls Agential Realism in which the world is made up of Phenomena which are (I think) the Entanglements you are asking about. They are the inseperability of agencies (subjects and objects) in an interaction. In Barads view, the universe can be thought of, not as a continuous flow of causality, but as an infinite series of 'snapshots' or 'slices of time' each of which is preceeded by the various factors led to that exact state of affairs and is followed by an infinity of possible universes that resolves into one determined future when a descision is made. Example: I pick up a coffee cup. Under Agential Realism Theory the moment at which I pick up the coffee cup is not just preceeded by my descision to take a drink. It is also preceeded by my descision to make coffee instead of tea, my choice of cup, the fact that I came to work this morning instead of staying in bed etc. It is proceeded by a variety of possibilities inculing my spilling the coffee on myself, taking a drink or dropping the coffee on my computer and dying in an electrical fire. In this model the entanglements are the connections between past, future and the agents involved in the interaction (in the example, me and the coffee cup). To utilise this in a programming language the entanglements would be the commands you write to the object model with the agencies involved being the Object Model and the Compiler. I would imaging that such a programming language would look somehting like the self-learning code that the google-brain and other neutral nets use to teach themselves based on external input. They aren't based on a traditional Object Model but instead rewrite their own command sets on the fly as new information is presented. 

Aquinas's third way falls down because he is observing time and the universe from the inside. he postulates a universe that must be contingent on an infinite, uncaused, prime-mover or it would have ceased to existed under the pressure of time and entropy. This is pretty much in line with current physical models that suggest the universe will eventually experience a heat-death. Aquinas simply couldn't concieve of the timescales involved. he thought in terms of hundreds and thousands instead of trillions of years. He didn't account for the possibility that the universe he was describing was non-contingent and in the process of dying. 

To infer truth from an argument it must be both valid and sound. A valid argument is one where it is impossible for the premises to be true and the conclusion to be false in the above example, this is the case so the syllogism is valid and sound. A sound argument is one where all the premises are actually true. This prevents the garbage in/garbage out effect that computer programmers will be familiar with where a valid piece of code gives an incorrect response because the variable are wrong. Here are a couple of examples:
