Drop orbital velocity to dip into earths atmosphere Burn off as much energy as possible by dumping water out the front Fire up some super powerful thrusters to slow your ship down for final descent. Land 

The basic answer is that ... they need to apply enough downward force to the raindrops to move themselves upwards. However, because rain is small, heavy and has a high terminal velocity, moving a [fin/arm/thing] fast enough to hit the rain drops would likely mean you'd get a higher efficiency using said appendage as a wing directly. Of course,if you lower gravity, then you have slower rain and a lighter person and it becomes more possible, but you'd still end up with some appendage that is more fin or wing than human arm. Also note that salmon can't swim up waterfalls for any great lengths of time. They jump up as quickly as they can rather than swim up gradually. So I doubt you'll end up with your person casually sauntering around the sky. 

Voltage is not the main consideration in electric wiring. Current and power are. If I have a computer that draws 500w, and run it at 5v, I need 100 amps. Having worked on a robot running at around 100 amps when under load, I can mention you'd need about a centimeter thick wire. That's going to weigh and cost a lot on a spaceship. Why so thick? To reduce resistance in the wire, which reduces energy loss/heat buildup, and stops it burning out under load. So for anything bigger than a laptop or desk-lamp, you're going to need higher voltages. (Power loss through resistance is only a function of current, so for the same power, higher voltages have less losses. This is why long distance powerlines are high voltages) Also, you can get sparks from surprisingly low voltages. As a kid I had great fun making short-lived carbon arc lamps running at 12v DC. There's another effect you should know about called ... flyback. If you have a motor happily running at 12v, and suddenly pull out the plug, the inductance in the motor coils can generate a large voltage (not because of the motors motion, but because of the coils magnetic field collapsing). How much? Depends on how fast you pulled the plug, and how big the motor is. For reference, I gave myself a nasty shock by building a poorly (self) designed motor driver for a 12v cordless drill motor. I didn't have a flyback diode, the FET was rated up to the thousands of volts (so it didn't burn out), so when PWM'ing the motor, the heatsink would go live to probably a couple hundred volts - enough to give me a nice surprise when I touched it! If you had a bigger motor, you could easily get into the kv range, even from a 12vdc supply. Also, electricity isn't required for sparks. Electricity is required for arcs. An arc is where the air is turned into a plasma, a spark is a small glowing hot thing. You can make sparks by banging rocks together, or grinding steel on a powered grindstone. The ferrocerium in a lighter creates sparks from the power of your thumb. If you pull a piece if steel in half fast enough, you generate heat and may get some 'sparks.' But as to why control panels in movies generate sparks when the spacecraft is hit? It's the rule of cool [insert tvtropes link] 

Your station will not have a very high speed. It will probably travel similar to balloons: find an altitude where the wind is blowing the direction you want to go. 

And the internet is not 'everywhere.' You can't just beam signals to a satellite and expect a connection. With really really advanced radios you may be able to find the nearest wifi hotspot - but I doubt you could if you were underwater. 2.4Ghz is very very readily absorbed by water - hence it's use in microwaves for heating food. Even if you could 'listen' you would have a hard time getting any data from it. Most access points are WPA2 PSK, and are hence encrypted and (short of huge effort) meaningless. 

The plant has a very short life-cycle, pollinating (somehow) and forming seeds within days. The plant is 'mobile' (eg sends out runners, and lets the old plant die) Some mechanism for replacing the ice exists (ice-fog with earthquakes???) 

And there are plenty of references to angels. I'm sure you can see how with a little poking from science, many would conclude that aliens were involved in some way. Actually, some claim it already (just go dig deep into the Ancient Astronaut theories and you'll probably find references to the Bible). However, in Christianity, the biggest "roadblock" is (source): 

Assume the planet had very few surface features - mountains are only hundreds of meters tall, valleys are only hundreds of meters deep. Maybe the whole world is only 3 kilometers in vertical distance from the tallest mountain to the deepest trench The entire world floods. You don't need as much water because the world is largely flat Wait 40 days and 40 nights.... The sudden influx of water causes cools (or heats) the Earth's crust, and this causes massive changes in the tectonics The planets surface now has mountains 10's of kilometers high, and 10's of kilometers deep Water races into the trenches that formed, carving huge gullys and washing away everything. 

While there are many posts here about how to make better weapons, I'll join Pete Kirkham in answering the question in the title: how do police work without guns. I come from a sizeable town in New Zealand, and when I was growing up, police officers were not allowed to carry guns. (And tazers weren't around yet either). And even now police still do not frequently carry firearms. In fact, I can't think of a single time I've seen a police officer in NZ with a weapon. This does not stop them from doing there job, because: A police officer is not a hero who shoots the bad guys. What does a police officer do? They direct traffic, they certify photos for driving licenses and passports, they make sure people are obeying the speed limit. None of that requires weapons of any sort. When encountering a police officer in New Zealand, it's just like meeting any other sort of person. Sure, he's in uniform - but if you need directions to the nearest gas station, or want have a question about the road rules, just ask a police officer. Sure, in NZ there is a special "Armed Offenders Squad" to deal with the cases where you need a highly trained military force to deal with a situation, but a police officer is just a guy who can help you out if you need it. When I went to Europe for the first time, and saw police officers carrying pistols, they broke that impression of the police immediately. Wearing a gun immediately separates the police from the civilians. They're no longer friendlies who can offer advice and help you out, they now become part of an enforcement agency who can use force to ensure citizens to do what the government says. If your police is overly armed, there is very little difference between a police force and an occupying army. Neither results in a safe-feeling society. 

But there's another problem: Earth has enough natural resources (rivers, solar etc) to provide more than enough electricity for the entire population for the foreseeable future. Why would this be different for other inhabited planets? Ignoring transmission and generation costs (aka what you could sell it for), this is what it would be. Electricity by itself is relatively valueless. For it to be worthwhile shipping electricity, the value of the electricity has to exceed the cost of storage and the cost of transport. It also has to exceed the value of building a generator. A generator is literally a money producing machine..... 

They need the be able to percieve This should be fairly obvious. Without perception of the environment, a forming intelligence will go crazy or commit suicide. Imagine if you had no eyes, no ears, no sense of smell or touch. How long would you remain sane? An earthly lifeform that has no perception but is alive is called a plant. A few can perceive a bit (such as some flowers tracking the light, or the venus flytrap catching it's prey), but they can see too little of their environment to be able to develop an intelligence. The exact senses are unimportant, though it will influence their later development - a blind species may never notice the stars. Other things that may matter include the range of vision (eg depth perception of items at close distances), the spectrum, and the resolution. They need to be able to manipulate If you had no arms, no legs, and could not even blink, how long would you remain sane? Similar to the ability to perceive, the ability to manipulate is required for an intelligence to emerge. The manipulation method must have sufficient dexterity and strength. Dolphins, dogs and so on are all highly intelligent creatures, but they lack dexterity. They also require multiple manipulators. An elephant is again highly intelligent, but a single trunk does not provide the ability to hold a tool and work-piece at the same time. Additionally, the field in which it manipulates it must be able to percieve. Many birds are quite intelligent creatures, but cannot see what their otherwise dexterous feet are working on. Hence it is unlikely they will achieve advanced tool use. 

On the whole, I'd say this is a pretty sane design, as well as a rather pretty picture. Also, I'd call them "sails" rather than "wings" but that's just personal preference. 

I do not know any single person who knows the entire stack from TCP/IP through to the encodings used in youtube videos. How is data in wifi encoded? What metadata is there? How do you perform a DNS lookup? However, if you manage to bash past transport layer and get a TCP/IP stack going, you may be able to request a simple site (google is probably to complex), and upskill from there. However, even things like wikipedia are out unless you have the knowledge of how SSL works. The alien spacecraft isn't going to know any of this. And if you don't know it, then there is nearly zero chance of connecting to the internet.
