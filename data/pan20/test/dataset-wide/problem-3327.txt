As for why intonation might be used to mark polar questions rather than content questions, my guess is that polar questions are the most frequent question type, so from a functional perspective, such a useful cue as F0 gets one more profit if it is used for the more common question type. This is just a hunch. For the prevalence of rising pitch contour used to mark polar questions, see the references below. Rialland's papers draw attention to a common phenomenon in African languages where polar questions are marked with a falling pitch contour.

see Kortlandt (1972) for discussion on the development of the phoneme in Soviet phonological theory, also Freeman (1935) for an idea of the issues at hand in the early days of American Structuralism. American linguists today tend to be either uncritical about a definition or openly hostile to the concept: Gussenhoven & Jacobs (1998: 55) "The term phoneme is used to refer to the segment category that the various allophones are variants of." Odden (2005: 43) "In english, [t] and [th] are predictable variants of a single abstract segment, a phoneme, which we represent as /t/. Predictable variants are termed allophones -- the sounds are in complementary distribution because the context where one variant appears is the complement of the context where the other sound appears." Ladefoged "Vowels and Consonants" (2001: 193--4) "If we are thinking in acoustic terms, even ? is not so far from t. On a spectrogram both correspond to very similar gaps in the pattern. Linguists have a term for a group of similar sounds of this kind. They call it a phoneme...We talk of the difference between kit and pit being the use of the phoneme /k/ as opposed to the phoneme /p/. There is usually no harm in expressing htings this way. But it is important to remember that it is a kind of shorthand. A phoneme is not a single sound but a group of sounds. Silverman (2006: 215) "For our purposes though, the phoneme is not an entity on any level—functional, phonetic, psychological, or even metaphorical. Rather, at best, phoneme is merely a terminological expedient that might capture the functional non-distinctness of any collection of phonetic properties that allomorphically alternates. And yet, despite its expedience, I choose to avoid the term altogether, because terminological expedients have a demonstrated tendency to become reified by their users." Ladefoged (ms.) "Perhaps the most startling conspiracy — one that seems to have deceived by far the majority of linguists — is the appearance of phonemes. Accounts of human behavior in terms of phonemes are nearly always examples of what has been called the psychologist's fallacy — the notion that because an act can be described in a given way that it is necessarily structured in that way. As will be shown later, phoneme size units play only a minor role in human behavioral acts such as normal speaking and listening. They are, nevertheless, great imaginary objects for use in describing linguistic aspects of speech." Goldsmith (1976: 17--8) "The standard linguistic assumption regarding the nature of phonological representations...implies that the process of language acquisition and of perception includes the development of the ability to take a representation and slice it vertically into columns...Let us call this assumption the "Absolute Slicing Hypothesis" ... The assumption of the Absolute Slicing Hypothesis fails...and this failure is in no sense a trivial one." ==== I'm going to add the index entry for for "Phoneme" in Fischer-Jorgensen (1975) "Trends in phonological theory", since I didn't have that book with me yesterday: Phoneme (1) concept and definition of the phoneme as: an abstractional fictitious unit 6.12 a bundle of distinctive properties (features) 3.3, 6.4, 8.3, 8.4, 8.18, 11.7, 11.25 a class of (non-contrastive) sounds 6.13, 12.10 a family of sounds 4.3 an element of a morpheme 11.3, 11.9 an ideal abstract sound type 12.17 a member of a phonological opposition 3.3, 4.3 a minimum distinctive unit 11.3, 11.7, 11.10, 11.30 a minimum same of vocal feature 6.4 a minimum unit, differentiating signifiers 11.15, 11.18 a notion with differentiating function 11.4 a point in a pattern 2.12 a physical unit 6.11 a psychologically defined unit 2.4, 3.3, 11.3 a purely logical symbol 6.14, 6.15 the realization of a morphon 10.4, 10.6, 10.12, 10.14 a unit based on comparison 11.30 a useless concept 9.67, 9.68 (but cp. 9.70)...

I think another way of getting at the same kind answer is to ask what can be done in morphology that can't be done in syntax. There are approaches to morphology where much of what is traditionally considered with morphology is handled with the same kind of formalism as is used in syntax, and morphology may be referred to as "word syntax" on occasion. However, I do not know of approaches to syntax that strive to account for most common syntactic phenomena using the language of morphology. When word derivations have hierarchical structures, and affixes are given the status of functional heads, it may seem like it's syntax all the way down. There are some facts about inflectional morphology, however, which make syntax-like accounts difficult to pursue to their logical end. (See Ch.1 of Stump 2001 "Inflectional morphology" for discussion) One of these is non-concatenative morphology. In affixal morphology, it is not a real problem to treat the stem and affix as constituents of a tree: [[dog]N.root [-z]PL]N -> dogs. When the morphology is non-affixal, there is a dilemma. But how is "men" derived? In Distributed Morphology, stem-changes are handled in the following way: a zero affix triggers a "readjustment rule" which changes the stem vowel: men = [[man]N.root [zero]PL] -> /man-zero/ -> men. Stump considers this a resort to "extraordinary means", since it seems like quite a large coincidence that so many languages should have an identical (zero) affix triggering stem changes. Non-concatenative morphology is a challenge for syntax-like approaches to morphology because the basic units of syntax are considered to have a strict precedence relationship: for two constituents X and Y, X must either precede Y or follow it; tertium non datur. Another issue is morphologically-conditioned phonological rules. Particular morphemes often trigger specific types of phonological alternations in a language (e.g. changes induced by suffixation of -ity on English nouns), but comparable syntactic phenomena, where, say, a particular type of category triggered an idiosyncratic phonological process in a sister constituent, seem very rare. A third issue is variable exponence. A given property, when realized morphologically, may have a wide range of unrelated exponents. In a single language, plural on nouns may be realized by either a prefix, a change in the stem vowel, or a change in the tone, depending on the word. Parallel phenomena are hard to find in syntax. If the issue is whether there should be a distinction at all, I suspect that it is in theory possible to remodel our theory of language structure so that syntax and morphology are modeled in the same way, but at the moment there are quite a few details of morphology which do not lend themselves to a syntactic explanation. 

A similar criticism, this time by a British phonetician, is found in Butlin (1937), who maintains (reflecting the then popular instrumentalist philosophy of science) that the phoneme is a "convenient fiction." Abercrombie (1991: 27ff.) [whose ideas were developed much earlier than the citation date suggests] cites Butlin's paper, disputing the status of segment-sized atomic units in language. Eventual attacks on the phoneme from the side of generative linguists are anticipated by Martinet (1949), who argues that while most phonological concepts should be regarded as fictions, it is necessary to select at least one having status in reality, so that the theory could be grounded in facts describable in the languages of other branches of science. The concept he selects as "...la seule unité pour laquelle nous postulions une existence réele..." (1949: 46) [the only unit for which we postulate actual existence] is the feature rather than the phoneme. Martinet, however, appears to favor a non-mentalist conception of the feature. Beginning with Halle (1954), American phonologists in what would become the generative tradition started to argue that the segment has psychologically real status, but that the phoneme is epiphenomenal, its observed properties actually being due to featural processes. A very nice historical introduction to phonology prior to the 1970's is Fischer-Jørgensen (1975). 

Diversity with respect to lexicalization of different word classes is an interesting issue, and you will find some interesting examples in the RRG literature (see @kgr's answer) of cases where the noun-verb distinction is more difficult to motivate. One point made by Croft in his book "Radical Construction Grammar," however, is that it is in general possible to analyze a language so that it has whatever number of lexical categories you like, so at a close level of scrutiny it is hard to motivate such claims as "Language X does not distinguish nouns and verbs." Outside of lexicalization patterns, there are some decidedly non-IE patterns which are documented in high quality descriptions of various languages. Some examples: Languages where the concept of syllable is called into question: Bella Coola, Gokana Languages where almost any category can predicate: Classical Nahuatl, Mwotlap Languages where the concept of subject is called into question: Acehnese Languages where cardinal directions are used in place of "left" and "right": Guugu Yimithirr Languages with up to half a dozen consecutive verbs in the same clause: Isu 

Probably a bit too cynical, but it comes close to the present situation. The endangered languages cause has captured the imagination of the public, and it is the best shot the field has had at making its work recognized as worthwhile since the idea of automatic translation. Even though language preservation falls more within the bounds of applied linguistics, it is something that professional linguists have found themselves involved in, partly because it is a good selling point for government funding agencies, and partly because they would like to find a way of giving back to the communities that they work in (in the case of field linguists). For those interested in how language endangerment has been approached by traditional linguists, a "classic" publication is a collection of essays published in 1992 in Language (Hale et al 1992). The previous year the French journal Diogène (no.153) dedicated an issue to the topic (though with much less exposure). A good and very recent report on language vitality by family can be found in Language 88(1):155--173 (similar open access material here). The contributors to the 1992 article stressed the following points: 

The key is to recognize that the GOCP could apply cyclically, first at one domain, then at a higher domain, since it can apply to all domains generally. So [[i i] [j]] contains two violations of GOCP, first for [i i], then for [i i j], while [[i] [i j]] contains only one violation, for [i i j]. As @James C. points out, I did not consider representations where one of the featural elements was multiply-linked. Ranking No-Spread (McCarthy 1995:53) high enough, however, can rule out such representations. Goldsmith, J. 1976. Autosegmental phonology. PhD. thesis, MIT. McCarthy, J. 1995.

I've done a couple of little experiments on the identification of stop consonants in whispered speech, though I haven't published the results or even fully analyzed the data, and don't know if I ever will. One of them was with a single Gengbe speaker, and the other was with 15 Korean speakers (if my memory serves me correctly). With that caveat in mind, I'll venture some guesses about whispered speech. It seems that whisperers articulate stop consonants in such a way that the aerodynamic effect of producing them is similar to normal speech. In normal speech voiced consonants have less pressure buildup behind the closure than do voiceless consonants phonation will not occur with too high of a transglottal flowrate. In whispered speech I think that talkers produce a voiced stop so that it has a pressure gradient across the constriction similar to what would be experienced if phonation were occurring. Listeners can then identify a voicing contrast by the intensity of the release burst. I think this is true because for both the Gengbe and Korean participants, identification of voicing/laryngeal contrasts was best for velar stops. Velar stops have a higher burst intensity overall than stops at other places of articulation, so differences between more and less intense bursts will be more palpable. Identification for Gengbe was worst for labial velar stops, which have a very faint burst release, and Korean labial stops were also poorly distinguished. Korean listeners were also able to distinguish at better than chance rates the fortis-lenis distinction, and I think that they were able to make use of duration differences to help with this. Place of articulation is determined by spectral properties of the speech signal which do not require periodic excitation of the oral cavity, so we would predict that vowel and consonant place of articulation information is well preserved in whispered speech, and I didn't find anything to contradict this. Gengbe makes a distinction between lamino-dental and apico-alveolar voiced stops, and these two were never confused by my participant. As expected, tonal contrasts are very poorly preserved, and my Gengbe participant could not distinguish at better than chance rates high and low tones. I don't think tonal contrasts should be ruled out altogether: one could in principle differentiate tones by altering the tension of the pharyngeal walls, making the airflow more or less turbulent, though this is just speculation. If anyone can contribute any references to published work on perception of whispered speech, I'd love to see them.
