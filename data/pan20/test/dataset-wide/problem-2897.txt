From what I've gathered, reliabilism states that epistemic justification occurs when someone forms a belief via truth-conducive methods. However, doesn't this fall to the problem of induction? Isn't reliabilism assuming that truth-conducive methods, or methods that have produced true beliefs in the past, will persist to be truth-conducive? 

What I don't quite understand is why the idealist/phenomenalist cannot logically infer that since the room he is in is not collapsing, there must be supports underneath the flooring. My question is this: cannot an idealist/phenomenalist have knowledge of unobserved entities through logical inference from his experiences? 

I am aware that Kant addressed Hume's skepticism on causality, but I don't see anything in his CPR that solves the problems of induction and uniformity of nature in other contexts like everyday life, where Hume's question, "will the sun rise tomorrow?" seems to persist. Exactly how does/would Kant solve the problems of induction (particularly uniformity of nature) in non-causal contexts, if he did at all? I am aware that there has already been a question like this, but I thought the answer to it only addressed induction in the context of causal formulations about the world; in this respect, I think Kant only dodged the problem of induction in causal formulations by solidifying causality as an intuition. Rationalizing your belief that the sun will rise tomorrow and rationalizing your belief that C-fiber firing causes pain seem to be two different things. 

As for his aphorisms, given their pithy and brief nature, you need to think long and hard about them, and not cave to the temptation of appropriating them out of context. Furthermore, it is beneficial to seek the expertise of Nietzsche researchers, who can better provide the context and clarity of how and why he wrote with an affinity for aphorisms. I could write on and on, but I hope this is a good modus operandi for approaching his fantastic works. Best of luck! 

"Of what benefit could Christian altruism possibly be to me?" (when it could disadvantage you?) "Why should I obey the teachings of Christ and 'love my neighbor' when he has clearly wronged me?" (when you could be physically harmed?) "What need is there for secular morality when I have the teachings of the Bible and the canons of the Church?" 

As with many instances in the progression of intellectual history, in order to understand the now, it is important to understand what has come before the now. With specificity to Nietzsche, it is important to recognize the influences of European philosophers, psychologists, scientists, and even musicians upon him (an aside, music was an important aspect of his life). Specifically, such names that come to mind are Schopenhauer, Kant, Hegel, Darwin, and who can forget Wagner! Each of these individuals, and more, produced an impact upon his thinking, whether in his approval or disapproval of their ideas, or even more analytically, a strange, sometimes ironic mixture of both. I highly suggest reading Friedrich Nietzsche by Curtis Cate, who crafts an excellent and truly enlightening biography of the personal and intellectual history of Nietzsche, which has helped enormously in understanding his later works. I think it somewhat vain for me to try to "correctly" answer how to "properly" read Nietzsche (or any philosopher for that matter), so I will outline how I approach his texts. Remember, this is after having read the biography mentioned above and having gained the reference, context, and knowledge of the milieu and events surrounding the numerous inceptions-and completions-of his many works. Furthermore, the astounding work of Nietzsche scholars (such as Walter Kaufmann) in the form of historical and comparative research has produced conveniently organized footnotes in most texts that I urge you not to ignore. This advice, I think, is also not particular to Nietzsche, but is a generally helpful and advantageous approach to reading philosophy in general. And as a final note, do not forget that the English text is and always will be a translation of the original German; take that as you will. For larger, continuous works (i.e., not aphorisms): 

Sizes of infinities This section is less relevant to your initial question, so I've split it off from the main answer, but it is important if you want to get a deep understanding of infinities. Cardinals Two infinite sets are considered to have the same cardinality if we can establish a one-to-one mapping between them. For example, the set of all integers, ℤ, has the same cardinality as the set of ℕ, which we can prove as follows: Let a be an arbitrary member of ℤ. If a is negative, we map it to -2a-1. If a is non-negative, we map it to 2a. This results in each element of ℕ mapping to a unique element of ℤ, and vice versa, so we can say the sets are the same size. On the other hand, we cannot do this with the real numbers. The proof, using Cantor Diagonalization, is a bit long to explain here, but understanding it will go a long way towards helping you understand infinities. The cardinality of the reals may be the next element in the set of cardinals, ℵ_1, but this hasn't been proven. There are an infinite number of cardinalities. In practice (at least in my field), we can just classify the infinite cardinals as "countable infinities", those of cardinality ℵ_0, or "uncountable infinities", which is every other size. Ordinals There are also an infinite number of ordinals. After ω, we have ω+1, ω+2, etc. After all of those, we have ω+ω = 2ω. And so on. 

In the United States, Donald Trump's election has been all the rage, and his Tweets and public declarations have received much attention, especially those that accuse CNN and the "liberal media" in general for being "fake news." Prima facie, this is an attempt to refuse facts for the sake of an agenda. However, these people who cry "fake news" may be on to something; while it might seem to be easy to justify the epistemological validity of news coverage, the problem ultimately boils down to the justification of hearsay: "I asked the man in the airport where the bathroom was, and I trusted him" is of a similar form as "I saw on The Washington Post that Scaramucci made some vulgar comments about Steve Bannon, and I believed it." Here's my main question: What is the epistemic justification for knowledge by news/hearsay? Is there a specific epistemological problem for this, and if so, what is it called? 

I think a possible solution might not lie in the truth or our knowledge of the truth of theory-laden theories or hypotheses as much as in their usefulness. Even if everything might be theory-laden, we still get magnificent results from the application of science. Although we can't claim with certainty to have knowledge or knowledge of the truth of phenomena, we can still make predictions and inventions for the sake of their products. In this light, then, we might be able to refute the anti-vaxxer or climate change denier by comparing his predictions and according results with a credible scientist's predictions and according results; the conceptual scheme that made more accurate predictions than the other would then qualify as "better" (albeit not "true"). Then, depending on how inaccurate the results turned out, we should reject the science-denier's theory/hypotheses on the grounds that it would simply be not worth our time. Alternatively, if the anti-science advocate's policies were enacted and harm arose from it, e.g. more and more children would begin to die of polio, then we could use these adverse effects as justification to reject their theory. To put it more simply, we should only accept the scientific community's conclusions on climate change or vaccines if they are more useful to believe. I'm more confident with this solution in the context of the natural sciences, but I would think it would still be applicable in social and political issues as well. Intuitively, I would respond that the relativism of social and political issues could be avoided if we only accepted falsifiable hypotheses, but that solution is obviously off the table. I'm no scholar, and I'm not sure if Quine or Kuhn or any of those you mentioned would even espouse this view, but I still think it is relevant and doesn't clash with theory-laddenness assumptions. 

Read every word, with particular attention to unfamiliar vocabulary. Nietzsche, as a philologist, was particular about his lexical and syntactic choice, I'm sure. Performing a close read of the text will benefit you enormously, particularly when you understand the then contemporary, historical meaning of his words and phrases, for which you will need the aid of footnotes and research. Taking his words merely for granted in the modern definitions and ideations proves inaccurate. Of course, what you are reading is a translation, which I am not qualified to evaluate, but a keen attention to every word, sentence, and paragraph will fully bring you into the experience, and set you up for the next "step". Note the stylistic, punctuational choices. You will notice that many texts use italicized, parenthesized, or hyphenated text, which to me at any rate, presents a thrilling experience for reading. And this makes sense, given Nietzsche's own opinions on how to write effectively, and I believe such mechanics were present in his original drafts. Feel the words, the phrasing, the tempo, the gravitas, of what you are reading, as it will convey far more emotion and impression than a mere clinical clean read. It should 'disturb' you and make you think, which prepares you for the next "step". Read the text again, but at a different time. If you have this luxury, try reading the text after some time off, or perhaps in a different mood (one that is still conducive to reading, though). You may be surprised, offended, or confused by what he writes, which dangerously lends to the temptation of dismissing his ideas and style. Understand that he may be speaking ironically, craftily, or earnestly, but all with intent and purpose. He is not an easily philosopher to understand! Ruminate! This is the most important step, and is not necessarily the last. Think, think, think, about what you have read, and consider the implications of his writing. Nietzsche was extraordinarily productive and crams so much in so little space. Think, at any point in time in your reading or even just in the everyday, about what could have led him to write what you read, and that exactly, and not something else. Think about particular paragraphs, sentences, even words, but without forgetting an understanding of the overarching themes of his message. 

From what I've collected, Quine seemed to have solved the problem of non-being by using Russell's theory of definite descriptions through the negation of the x having certain properties/descriptions. However, I hear Kripke rejected Russell's definite descriptions. How did Kripke solve the problem of non-being with his theory of reference? 

It seems intuitive to me to think that if there is a basic substance or building block of nature (e.g. fermions and leptons, etc.), then all facts regarding entities comprised of that substance are reducible into facts about instances of said substance. For example, the term "water" is reducible, on a chemical level, to "two hydrogen atoms combined with an oxygen atom via covalent bonds." In turn, this chemical equivalent of "water" is reducible to something like "two sets of identical combinations of subatomic particles combined with another unique combination of subatomic particles via [insert some atomic description of covalent bonds] (I'm no physicist)." I like to think that this process can proceed until we reach the most basic of substances, at which point we would arrive at the most primal description of a phenomena. I think topics of the social sciences are subject to this as well. For instance, "a language" can be reduced to "particular sets of certain reverberations used in certain groups of massive collections of subatomic particles (people) who engage in brain states that correlate both/either artifacts of physical substance and/or brain states with some of those particular reverberations of sound." Obviously, you could go "deeper" in the analysis, but for the sake of time and my sanity, I won't try to do any better; you probably get the idea. That was just my understanding of a typical reductionist project, but I have a feeling that I might have just conflated reductionism with physicalism. My question still stands, regardless: What are some of the problems with reducing natural and social phenomena into facts about the primary substance of which they are all ultimately made of? 

It might be useful to consider the statement, "No more than 0.01% of swans are black". If we randomly pick 50,000 swans and none of them are black, we can be ~99% confident that we would have falsified the statement had it been false. Now, the statement isn't technically the same as saying "no swans are black", but it's almost as good in practice. 

Which is to say, A contains exactly the same elements as ℕ. The only difference between the sequence and the set is that the sequence is ordered. So it would seem that there isn't an especially meaningful distinction between "potential" and "actual" infinities. But there is a meaningful distinction between the size of A itself and the size of the individual elements of A. And that brings us to the cardinals and ordinals. Cardinals The cardinals are used for counting the number of elements in a set. The standard notation for the size of set A is |A|. The value of |A| is always a cardinal. Cardinals can be finite or infinite. e.g. |{1,2,3}| = 3. If the set is actually infinite, we use the aleph (ℵ) numbers to represent them ℵ_0 is the cardinality of the natural numbers: ℵ_0 = |ℕ|, and is the smallest of the infinite cardinalities. Ordinals The ordinals are used to establish an ordering over a set. The ordinals themselves are fully ordered, and thus if we can establish a one-to-one mapping between any set and the ordinals, we can establish a well-ordering over the set. In the example of A, that involves mapping the subscript to the value of the element. Since A_i = i, that's trivial to do: f(i) = i. For the finite ordinals, we just use the natural numbers, same as for the cardinals, since the context makes it clear whether we're talking about ordinals or cardinals. There are also infinite ordinals, but they work a bit differently from the infinite cardinals, in that they're defined (at least partially) as limits. The first infinite ordinal, ω, is defined as the smallest ordinal that is greater than all the natural numbers. ω is the limit ordinal for the set A: A_i < ω for all i. Summary So we have our set, A, which we can just call ℕ at this point since that's what it is: 

I'm currently writing a paper for a class that's supposed to "weave" together the philosophical system presented in Plato's Allegory and dialogues. When I spoke with my professor on the assignment, he said that Plato's own philosophical opinions were unwritten and cannot necessarily be gleaned from his own writings, and thus I ought not to refer to the system found in Plato's texts as "Plato's philosophy." Is this true? Are we wrong to attribute things like the Theory of Forms and the proto-social contract theory as described in Meno to Plato? 

It's a common criticism of Spencer's social Darwinism that it misunderstands the entire theory of evolution and the meaning of "fitness" such that it is commonly exploited to fulfill specific hateful political agendas. However, what exactly is wrong with the notion that the most competent individuals in society thrive? Consider an academic setting with a particularly rigorous professor running a particularly rigorous course. Obviously, only the most studious and tenacious students will be able to pass while the lazier ones will either fail or drop the class, and rightly so; only those who earn their keep should be rewarded. How is this idea immoral? Perhaps I am misunderstanding social Darwinism. 

Having read some of Friedrich Nietzsche's philosophical works, as well as the acclaimed biography of Nietzsche by Curtis Cate (which I suggest all those who are interested in Nietzsche should read), I understand that Nietzsche did not view Plato and his philosophy favorably, specifically, the Platonic ideal, and the notion of otherworldly truth and knowledge. Whether or not there is any record of Nietzsche's specific opinion on the allegory, I am unaware of, but I shall still try to opine on the matter. Given his scrutiny of Plato however, I'm inclined to believe it is somewhere out there. I conjecture that the element of the story that Nietzsche would most approve of is the particular man's escape from the cave, and his venturing out into the 'real' world, out beyond the confines of the cave. Allegorically and in a Nietzschean spirit, the primitive and suffocating cave, and its residents, could represent the mediocrity of the prevailing intellectual and moral system, which would rather continue a fixation with mere reflections of 'reality' than attempt a constructive investigation of ethics and reality. My current understanding of Nietzsche lends me to the belief that this man, who has escaped the mirages and projections of what is real, would posses the opportunity of truly escaping "the herd" that resides within the cave, a term Nietzsche usually uses to describe the prevailing morality of the masses, influenced by Christian dogma as well as ossified by historical inertia. Thus, this lone man (the primordial Übermensch perhaps?), who has escaped (by chance, if I remember the allegory correctly), has triumphed over the rest in his opportunity to grasp the world as it really is. The interesting literary and situational parallels to Zarathustra are many to be considered. As to whether there was anything 'real' outside of the cave, I believe that Nietzsche would not deny a physical reality 'of the way things are' outside of the projections and pretenses of conventional morality, and how morality influences the worldview. After all, he believed very much so, based upon what I can gather from On the Genealogy of Morality, that science during his time was one of the factors that contributed to the abandonment of traditional knowledge and virtues, so much so that he may have feared its unintended or insidious contribution to cultural nihilism. At any rate, Nietzsche did now infamously quote "there are no facts, merely interpretations", or something to that effect, though there is a greater context to that statement within The Genealogy. Still, Nietzsche was not anti-science, and within the understanding of the allegory, the man's escape from projection and duplicity towards reality and empiricism (after all, he relied upon his senses to absorb and intake the real, outside world) would be consistent with Nietzsche's urging of 'self-overcoming', which is another related concept. 

After reading Kant's Idea For a Universal History, I've become intrigued by Kant's notion of Nature guiding the dealings of men towards a "perfectly rightful civil constitution." Although the relationship between man and Nature remains clear, what would Kant say is the meaning for any human existence independent of Nature? Perhaps there is some overlap between the meaning of human life simpliciter and the meaning of human life in relation with Nature? 

It seems to me that the rejection of the validity of induction would cause a deep skepticism in pretty much everything but most prominently in perception. If we can never assume uniformity of nature, then every inference about the future and the future based on the past is invalid. Thus wouldn't the rejection of induction restrict us to only be able to talk validly about our present phenomenal experiences or whatever is directly present in the mind? What are the practical ramifications of rejecting induction? It seems that it would throw us all into intense skepticism. 

I've done some personal research on formal logic, but I was wondering how philosophers today actually use it to, say, develop an argument. The most relevant example I can think of is Plantinga's modal ontological argument; but other than that, a lot of what I've seen so far is simply the use of formal logic to rephrase or make more explicit the nuances of certain phrases (e.g. "Paul is son of x and Elmer is son of y and x is colleague of y" (Word and Object)). What are some of the ways philosophers use formal logic apart from clarifying ordinary language?
