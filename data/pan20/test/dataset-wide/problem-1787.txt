You need to put your .htaccess file in the server folder abc - so you need to check the path to the root of your site, and then put the .htaccess in the abc folder in that root folder. For example, <- put .htaccess here. 

A remote office has a Cisco ASA 5505 connecting the LAN to our HQ LAN via VPN. When a particular Windows XP PC is connected to the ASA via a switch, the VPN tunnel drops, and after a short while, all connections through the ASA stop working. Disconnect the PC and it all starts working again. The only time I have seen anything like this happen was when someone created a network loop by connecting two network ports on a switch together, where spanning-tree was disabled. However, we have traced all the cables in this small remote office, and it does appear to be a single PC/NIC causing the problem. Is there any configuration that could be put on the PC that might result in this sort of behaviour? If so, I can clean it up. If not I can clearly assume that the NIC is faulty, and replace it. BTW - I am assuming this is a simple layer 2/3 network related issue affecting the router or switch functionality of the ASA. It could of course be something else. Cables and basic network configuration (IP address, Link Speed/Duplex) all checked. ClamWinPortable scan from a USB drive found nothing. No sign of unauthorised software. Any other suggestions would be welcome. I would just get a new NIC if this PC wasn't in rural Sierra Leone... If only someone could invent a farcaster or teleportation device. 

One suggestion might be UserVoice... It is billed as a product forum but might work for your needs... 

You mention an internal network of 192.168.0.1 for the Hyper-V host but nothing about whether the Hyper-V host has another interface that allows communication to the internet. It is usual practice to configure the Hyper-V host with an "external" interface that can communicate out to the internet, and then the internal interface that can communicate to the VM servers. Your VM servers on the 192.168.0.x network will need a router to route the traffic through which can be another VM configured as a router or you can configure the Hyper-V host to be the router. With the router configured you then need to set the VM machines default gateway to be the router IP address... that should get you going... 

Hyper-V synthetic interfaces are bound to the hypervisor, and the Hyper-V product has most everything (if not all) you will find on other platforms. Lastly, I would suspect that all vendors are going to end up offering the base Hypervisor for free and the profit will come from management and add-ons. Enterprise virtualization decisions really need to be made with product comparisons and considerations of the product road-map. 

I guess you have your reasons for doing this, but taking Zoredache's question as a kind of answer - you could set up squid on your server (if you don't already have it) and have all the web requests run through that. Surely you are already running some kind of proxy server to allow this anyway - in which case more than likely there is some such functionality available to you through that. I don't think the fact the traffic is tunneled to the server is of much relevance here, but perhaps you can provide more details on the use case, and how you are currently achieving things. 

Due to an intermittent internet connecton and some fat fingered typing, I came very close to sending the command to my server, which I think would be fairly disruptive. Is there a way to backup just the permissions on all the files on the system? 

You'll get faster response for web surfing and reduce your network traffic if you set up a local DNS server, even if you only use it as a proxy DNS server (e.g. all your client machines do their lookups to your local DNS server, which then does the lookups on the public/ISP DNS of your choice, and then caches the answers). Why will you get faster response? Ping a host on your 10/100/1000 Mbit network, and compare the result to pinging a public DNS server over your 1/2/8/10 Mbit internet connection. My guess is that you will benefit immediately from a local DNS infrastructure which won't cost you all that much. If you also use it for local hostname resolution, then you'll benefit from easier to remember, meaningful hostnames for the hosts on your network. 

Our environment prevents network capture solutions on production servers for the primary reason that you don't want it to be overly easy for tier'd admins to perform network captures. The actual files necessary to run WireShark and/or NetMon don't themselves present much of a risk, rather the ability of admins to perform captures can be considered a risk. 

With limited memory capabilities (2 GB PC2-6400 unbuffered DDR2 800 MHz Maximum) and no video output included you might be a little hard pressed to install and configure Windows 2008. This device is specifically built for the Windows Home Server. You would be better off building a custom server that can handle what you want to achieve. 

IPSec should fill your needs and it's free/included in Windows. Nothing fancy here, just a simple deny rule and a filter matching the offending IP Address spaces... 

I was faced with the same requirements, so I started with a Netscreen 5gt device and then ended up with a Juniper SSG-5 device. Both of these devices have a basic mode that is similar to a Linksys device for NAT, but can also be extended to have multiple vlans in addition to supporting multiple IP addresses from your ISP. The best part about this is it's similar to your Linksys device in that it's a small appliance device that has a Web based GUI interface, along with a more powerful command line syntax. If you look on Ebay you can find some reasonably priced units, depending on the age of the OS and whether it's from Juniper (who bought Netscreen) or the older units from Netscreen. I have been really happy with the device and the configuration options. If you need help configuring the device just let me know... I have a similar requirement to what you described and could share my config information with you... 

Wireless is disabled by default on any router that doesn't include wireless functionality ;-) I think you could probably achieve this using open source firmware on the router. Here's a couple of examples that will work on quite a few Linksys routers: 

Making changes outside of the change control procedure. Even if any bad thing that happens unrelated to the change you made, your ass will still get kicked as badly by those higher up the pecking order. Of course, practially speaking, some changes have to be made faster than the change control procedure allows, but in each case the risk to career is higher. Sometimes it is better to work to rule and let the system fail, than go against the system... 

Think about how you would do this physically - you have a separate physical network with your test servers on, with its own DC on that network. If you needed any kind of communication with your live system, you'd use a firewall/router connected to both networks to control exactly what packets are allowed to pass between the networks. You can do this in VMware ESX by creating a new vSwitch for your dev environment. You could create a dedicated firewall VM running something like m0n0wall, and connect that to both the dev vSwitch and your production vSwitch. You want to be very careful about letting the DC on the dev system in particular talk to the production network! Set up your firewall rules before connecting the firewall/router to the production network. 

The short answer is that IIS allows you to configure exclusions to what gets logged in IIS. The documentation is pretty easy to follow and should meet your requirements. Check out my article titled Limit what gets logged in IIS 7... 

My Wordpress tables appear to be in need of optimization so I looked into the commmand OPTIMIZE TABLE . When I run the command I get the following results: 

Exporting private keys on certificates that have been marked non-exportable? Uh, how about a tool called Jailbreak... 

While I am a little confused about this statement: Or is there a ... way ... to filter out ... RTMP to 80, but still allow RTMPT to 80 (where all four hostnames are identical)? I would think that you could also try and create an IPSec filter to block certain traffic to/from specific hosts and allow certain traffic to/from specific hosts... 

Unfortunately you cannot upgrade from Windows 2000 Active Directory to Windows 2008 Active Directory directly. You must first upgrade to Windows 2003 and then to Windows 2008. More about this can be found on Microsoft's Technet Article. From the article: 

The goal of a DMZ is usually to separate the untrusted network from the trusted network. Depending on the level of firewalls you can control many aspects of the connection besides just opening up ports. My experience has been that companies put in place a policy that prevents any untrusted connections from communicating directly with trusted resources, with exceptions being carefully reviewed. For example, reverse proxy servers in the DMZ can provide pre-authentication for untrusted connections before they are served up data from trusted resources. Another point worth considering is that even with opening up ports, it is possible to control which devices can communicate over those ports. For example, it might be necessary to open up a port to allow SQL communication between a web server in the DMZ and a SQL server in the trusted newtwork, but you could restrict the traffic flowing through that port to only the Web server and the SQL server. Utimately it's up to you to craft a boundary policy that will provide the minimal level of access to satisfy your application requirements. 

A pair of Cisco ASA 5505's will do this in a number of different ways. The simplest would be to have an ASA plugged into each of your ISP connections, designate one as primary, then configure the secondary to kick in if the primary link goes down. This also gives you hardware redundancy which you won't get with a single server (which is pretty much all your Dual-WAN routers were). Chapter 10 of the Cisco Press Cisco ASA book (ISBN: 978-1-58705-819-6) describes the config pretty well, and I am sure you can find a Cisco partner who will take you through it at reasonable cost. You might also be able to do something with HSRP/VRRP on two routers connected via a switch, and a good network engineer. Better than me, as I can't tell you how to do it :-) 

Use traceroute (tracert in windows) against Google. This effectively gives you the latency to each hop between you and Google, and will give you an idea if it is your router, or further upstream. 

You have quite a lot of options with the equipment you have. The main limitation right now seems to be your lack of familiarity with the ASA platform. If time is limited, then you should probably seek support/consulting from where the ASAs were obtained. If money is more critical than time, then you need to study up on ASA VPNs. A good place to start is the Cisco Press ASA book (ISBN 978-1-58705-819-6) which has walkthroughs for setting up VPNs amongst other things, as well as explaining the concepts. The documentation available online is also essential reading, but it can be a bit hard to find exactly what you need. You may also want to upgrade the firmware and ASDM on your ASAs. Version 7 is quite old now, and the more recent ASDM interfaces are a little better IMO. Also, if the Site B ASA is a more recent purchase, it is very likely it has a more recent firmware. You will find life easier if they are both on the same version. When reading the documentation, it is essential you are reading the documentation that matches your firmware version - there are quite different configuration syntaxes between version 7.0 and the most recent version (8.4). 

If you're using IIS then your log files can record the field cs(Referer) which will show when someone has come to your site via an external link... 

The App_Data Folder To improve the security of the data used by your ASP.NET application, a new subfolder named App_Data has been added for ASP.NET applications. Files stored in the App_Data folder are not returned in response to direct HTTP requests, which makes the App_Data folder the recommended location for data stored with your application, including .mdf (SQL Server Express Edition), .mdb (Microsoft Access), or XML files. Note that when using the App_Data folder to store your application data, the identity of your application has read and write permissions to the App_Data folder. What's new in ASP.NET Data Access

Something like Nagios (which has thousands of user contributed checks) is probably your best bet, although Nagios can take a long time to set up. I've had a good experience with Groundwork OpenSource, which is basically Nagios with a config web GUI, then added additional checks from Monitoring Forge. All these checks are basically written in PERL or some other scripting language, and can be adapted for use fairly easily if you don't need the web front end or notifications of something like Zabbix or Nagios. Groundworks includes a lot of WMI based checks as well, which is better suited to Windows monitoring. 

There may be benefits for you, but almost none for your customers. Maybe you can make it cost less, depending on your requirements, but I think that is the only possible benefit and it is questionable. Actually - there is a benefit that isn't insignficant - you will learn a lot by setting up and maintaining your own server, but your customers suffer from all the mistakes and trial and error. Downsides for you are: 

instead of ? If that works, then it is the MIBs - see net-snmp wiki for a tutorial on how to install and use MIBS. Otherwise check your syntax as pointed out by Mike Weber
