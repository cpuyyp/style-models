In English, if we want to use the girl to link up the two clauses, we can passivise the first clause. A similar situation obtains in syntactically ergative languages, which instead use the antipassive, where the A becomes S (and is thus absolutive) and the P becomes oblique. Compare the behaviour of English and Waalubal, a dialect of Bandjalang, below: 

The easiest way to answer this is by using an example of each. Look at the following examples from Pintupi and Wargamay: 

So I'm looking for a good, citable definition, not laden in theoretical terminology, under which it is clear whether (1) is a type of long-distance reflexive. Thanks! 

These would sound more natural and less literary in normal speech if we add markers like dehua or jiu ('then'), but they are perfectly acceptable and normal in Classical Chinese. 

These are called multi-word expressions (MWEs). Before we put things into a POS tagger, we need to perform another process known as tokenisation to separate characters into words. This is especially important in Chinese, where there are no whitespaces at all, but is also needed in English, where strings surrounded by word boundaries (in the sense of regex) are not always words either. For solutions, you can search on Google scholar; there is a huge literature on that. :)

Assuming that you're unsure as to whether it's a complement or an adjunct, standard tests can be applied: (1) Optionality: #The latest research on dieting always warns people about the dangers. (Not possible except when the PP is elided) Compare: I tied my shoelaces (at noon). (2) Restrictions on type: *The latest research on dieting always warns people about the dangers at sleeping late. ('Dangers' requires 'of', not 'at') Compare: I tied my shoelaces in the washroom/at school/during recess. (3) Restrictions on number: *The latest research on dieting always warns people about the dangers of too much cholesterol of too little sleep. (Can't have more than one complement) Compare: I tied my shoelaces in the washroom at school during recess. (4) Restrictions on position: *Of too little sleep, the latest research on dieting always warns people about the dangers. Compare: At school, I tied my shoelaces. All these point to the PP being a complement, so it should be the daughter of N' and the sister of N. 

People utter stuff like (1), but they do so because of memory limitations or other cognitive quirks. (There could also be other reasons why you make mistakes - perhaps you just imperfectly acquired then language when you grew up, so you say e.g. 'deers' when everyone else says 'deer' - but that is unlikely.) When you say something that merely deviates from the standard variety of the language, as codified in the Japanese dictionary, it doesn't mean that you're wrong. It merely means that you're speaking something other than the standard variety. Sometimes, this can be because the dialect you speak is innovative - which implies language evolution - and other times, this can be because the standard variety is more innovative. For example, it is non-standard in modern Chinese to use the morpheme corresponding to the character 至 to indicate superlatives, but it was not in Old Chinese. A good essay on these matters is this paper by Geoff Pullum, if you're interested in some further reading. Cases like 'you're/your' and 'alot' are orthographic errors, not grammatical ones, and are quite different from the Japanese case. Of course, with orthography there are also standard and non-standard varieties and both can also change through time, but it's not as systematic as spoken language. Whether writing 'alot' is wrong is more of a matter of definition here, though I'd say that if you're writing something that should follow standard orthographic conventions but you do not follow them, then you're 'wrong'. 

This suggests that 'on Thursday' is an adjunct and 'to work' is the complement, i.e. this structure is appropriate: 

As you can see, academic texts consistently do this less often than do other texts. On the surface, this seems to indicate that the question to your question is 'yes'. But is it really so? This table does not take into account one important factor: The prevalence of these possessive pronouns in the first place (irrespective of context). It turns out that possessive pronouns are less common in academic writing in the first place (I exclude his and its since they may not be pronouns): 

I think he is using 'passive' to mean 'the passive transformation', probably because this was the most common meaning of 'passive' at the time. He's arguing that we can generate and interpret passive sentences directly without using transformations, and that the difference between passive and active is that in the passive, the verb cannot take an object. I suspect he would not disagree that the word 'passive' is still useful for talking about the sentence structure; it's just that he does not agree with treating it as a transformation from the active. The reason why he takes opposing the passive transformation to be the same as opposing the passive is apparently because he believes that transformational grammar serves as a universal metalanguage for describing natural language syntax, and linguistic concepts should be defined in terms of this universal metalanguage. Since the passive does not exist in this metalanguage, it does not exist at all. 

Max Weinreich is usually said to be the person who created the quip, but according to the Wikipedia entry on him, he was actually quoting someone else. 

So once we've identified a set of prototype verbs in a language - e.g. 'kill', 'stab', 'fight', 'realise', etc., we look at what distributional and morphosyntactic features they have. Unlike the structuralists, though, we don't treat them as necessary and sufficient conditions. Instead, we treat them as violable rules. A verb will be like most other verbs in most ways - but there will always be outliers which lack one or two morphosyntactic features! For some of these criteria (there are a plenty in the literature), verbs in English can be put in the syntactic frame 'They will _' (for transitive verbs) and 'They will _ it' (for intransitive verbs), they can inflect for past tense and for the third person singular in the present, they can take perfect and progressive forms, and they take on at least one argument except in imperatives. Some verbs don't satisfy all of these criteria and are therefore less prototypical verbs. Often, these are verbs that have experienced a high degree of grammaticalisation, such as the auxiliary verbs 'can, should, may', etc. In the American structuralist tradition (Bloomfield and his followers - Hockett, Bloch, etc.), meaning was not thought to be part of the language, and syntactic categories had to be uncovered through 'discovery procedures', and that means, according to their extreme empiricist views, that there must be a set of distributional criteria picking out all and only members of a particular word class. For them, as Prof. Lee mentioned, verbs must all have something in common. But this is no longer believed to be the case in the linguistic community. There is nothing that all verbs have in common. As Donohue (2008) noted,

Liquids and nasals can sometimes be syllabic as well. (In fact, in Berber, even stops can be syllabic sometimes.) The more precise IPA symbols for these syllabic consonants add a vertical dot underneath the letter, e.g. [sɪləbl̩]. As for how that happens, it's one of the strategies that a language can employ to syllabify stray consonants. I'll illustrate from a derivational perspective (as I assume you haven't gotten to optimality yet). English doesn't allow [bl] to be a coda, as it violates sonority. So when you try to syllabify /sɪləbl/, after the first pass you get sɪ.ləb.l with a stray [l]. So the English system tries to fix this by turning the [l] syllabic, into [l̩], and subsequently assigning a sigma to the newly syllabic consonant. Then the [b] gets re-assigned as the onset of the brand-new syllable, and eventually you end up with [sɪ.lə.bl̩]. You can compare this with the French system, which has no problem with [tabl]. P.S. Your curriculum sounds slightly odd... distinctive features are a phonological theory rather than a phonetic one. 

But it's not clear that the distance between 'John' and 'himself' is longer than in (2), which is acceptable in English: 

You've hit upon one of the key insights in modern linguistic theory! :D You are partially right in your observations. Humboldt actually made the opposite observation, that an isolating language is the more 'primitive' form, and languages tend to become morphologically complex afterwards (i.e. become agglutinative), and finally the morphological boundaries become less clear (i.e. the language becomes fusional). Humboldt's process is linear, like yours. However, it was later discovered by Gabelentz that fusional languages tend to become isolating. So he closed the loop, resulting in a cycle: Isolating -> Agglutinative -> Fusional -> Isolating... Note that a common error is to regard this cycle as bidirectional. It is not; it is unidirectional, because when a language reaches, say, another isolating state after passing through the agglutinative and fusional states, the new language is no longer the same as the original isolating one. Why does this happen? This question is adequately answered by the modern theory of grammaticalisation. The expression of meaning in the grammar goes through several stages. This cline is roughly as follows: 

According to the work of philologists, the particles 曰 *[ɢ]ʷat, 于 *ɢʷ(r)a, 云 *[ɢ]ʷə[r] were aspect markers in Early Archaic Chinese, marking the 'prospective', continuous and 'actualising' aspects respectively. They are different forms of the same word, and their phonological difference ultimately originates from TAM suffixes in Proto-Sino-Tibetan. (I suspect these markers may express properties of modality and not just aspect, but in any case, the bottom line is that they were markers of TAM at first.) However, when you look at Late Archaic Chinese, pretty much all instances of 曰 *[ɢ]ʷat and 云 *[ɢ]ʷə[r] are either copulas or verbs introducing quotations. 曰 *[ɢ]ʷat can also function like a quotative, like the modern Chinese 道 dao. 曰 *[ɢ]ʷat and 云 *[ɢ]ʷə[r] also occasionally take newly-grammaticalised aspect markers like 既 *[k]ə[t]-s as well. So it seems that we have a case of functional morphemes gaining very lexical meaning and acting like other verbs. This use of 曰 *[ɢ]ʷat and 云 *[ɢ]ʷə[r] are extremely common, and the older TAM uses have seemingly vanished without trace. Is such a change attested in any other language family? Should this be considered a counter-example to the unidirectionality hypothesis of grammaticalisation, or simply a case of lexicalisation? Thanks. 

'Fa cai' means getting rich. As for 'golden turtle', that could mean an actual gold turtle (everything from gold mooncakes to gold Mickey Mouses exist out there, so you shouldn't be surprised), or it could be a beetle - the Chinese word for beetle is 金龜子 jinguizi... 

The sentences on the left are known as indirect speech, and the ones on the right are known as direct speech. This is a more general phenomenon; the matrix clause need not be a command (as in your examples), but can also be - in fact, are more commonly - statements, as I'll illustrate in the examples below. The primary difference between the two lies in deixis, which is a pragmatic concept. In direct and indirect speech, we 'point' to the same entities, but from different angles, and therefore need different deictics. Subtypes of deixis include person (e.g. personal pronouns), spatial (e.g. NPs denoting places with reference to the point where the speaker is standing) and temporal (e.g. tense, time with reference to the present) deixis, and all three need to be changed when transforming from direct to indirect speech and vice versa: 

To understand the for-complement clause, it is necessary to look into a bit of history. For was not originally a complementiser in English. Sentences like (1a) originally arose: 

The accusative form him thus reflects its earlier status as the complement of the preposition for. I suspect this is not what you're looking for - your tags suggest you are looking for a theoretical treatment within a Chomskyan framework - but I think we don't really need to look for a synchronic explanation when a good diachronic one exists.

It is a relative clause. A plot of land is acting as the lexical head of the RC, and in relation to was 'moved' to before the relative pronoun (not conjunction) which through the process of pied piping; you can see more examples on the Wikipedia page linked. 

Because 'him' and the subject of 'exercise' co-refer, sentences like (1a) were naturally reanalysed as something like this: 

Huddleston, R. (2002). 'Non-finite and verbless clauses.' From Huddleston, R. & Pullum, G. K. et al., The Cambridge Grammar of the English Language. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. Edit: For the historical origin of the construction, please see my answer to this question. 

In English, nouns only belong in the Subject and Object positions, adjectives only belong in adjectival positions, and adverbs only belong in adverbial positions. Verb phrases belong only in predicate positions. Prepositional phrases are more flexible though, and can be objective, adverbial or adjectival. Yet this is not the case in Chinese. Let's look at where the major lexical categories fit: 

In some languages, the agent is incorporated into the verb. Keenan and Dryer cite English examples like 'this project is state-controlled', and mention that this process is more productive in Quechua: 

Unlike vowel formant frequencies, tones are trickier to determine, since the F0 of a TBU may depend on a lot of factors, such as the speaker's age, gender, mood, etc. Thus, it's quite often the case that accounts based on impressionistic transcription disagree on whether a tone is, say, 24 or 35. I know from looking at Praat that the same tone - even if it sounds perceptually similar to me - can produce completely different-looking F0 contours in Praat. Is there any established experimental procedure to determine the pitch(es) of a tone, either in Chao's system (1 is lowest, 5 is highest) or the Central Americanist one (reverse)? Thanks! 

The difference seems to be how you frame the concept. From Hopper and Traugott's book, some linguists believe that grammaticalisation could be understood as 'entering the grammar of a language', i.e. 'becoming grammatical', which assumes that 'grammar' is an fixed entity which things can enter and leave. Grammaticisation, by contrast, focuses on the lexical item being grammaticalised itself - it's the process whereby this lexical item becomes more and more narrow in distribution and the phrases containing it become more and more formulaic, and eventually the item acts as a functional word rather than a lexical one. H&T do not commit to this distinction, but are merely explaining the viewpoints of linguists who do differentiate between the two. 

He then suggests that the traditional opinion that the copula be is a lexical verb is based on the erroneous assumption that every sentence must have a lexical verb. So Payne a) suggested a language-specific definition of lexical verbs , and b) defended the unified treatment of copular and auxiliary be as both auxiliary. 

If you look at the aspect system of Baltic and Slavonic languages, Baltic systems actually resemble the earlier stages of Slavonic systems (Comrie, 1976). In Lithuanian, adding a prefix to a verb root renders it Perfective, sometimes resulting also in some other semantic change. There is also a suffix -inè, albeit with limited productivity, which changes these prefixed verbs back into Imperfective. Latvian is similar, though without this suffix. This in fact echoes the paths of change in language such as Russian. In the beginning there was a verb, say Russian pisat' ('write'), to which would be added a prefix to form perfective form, either without change in meaning, as in Russian na-pisat' ('write'), or with such a change, as in vy-pisat' ('write out'). Latvian is still at this stage. Later, Imperfective versions of those verbs which gained more-than-aspectual prefixes would appear, so the Russian word vy-pisyvat appeared. Lithuanian is going through this stage. Source: Comrie, B. (1976). Aspect: An introduction to the study of verbal aspect and related problems. Cambridge University Press. 

More traditional approaches categorise 'because' as a subordinating conjunction in the same category as since, as, if, as long as, although, etc., as opposed to coordinating conjunctions like and, or and but. More modern approaches subsume the category of subordinating conjunctions under prepositions instead. A prominent grammar that advocates the preposition view is the Huddleston and Pullum grammar. Pullum also makes the cause that because is a preposition here. The basic idea is that a preposition may subcategorise for a full clause, which is what 'because' can do.
