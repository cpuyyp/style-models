If you don't want to use a bicycle grease (Park Tool PolyLube 1000 or Phil Wood Waterproof grease or Shimano's greases or whatever), use something like automotive multipurpose or wheel bearing grease. The Valvoline stuff is red and comes in a big tub for about 5-10 dollars and can be bought at any automotive shop. 

Note: I don't do cyclocross, so this is mostly speculation. I'd guess its primarily a weight issue, as well as the culture of the people who do cyclocross. I did find a manufacturer doing rear suspension though. This link is also interesting reading. The author first notes that suspension would make the ground contact better, but the weight or geometry changes seem to be problems. From that link, I'd like to quote from that article "UCI rules make no prohibition against suspension in cyclocross or road bikes, and road bikes with suspension forks have been used in UCI-sanctioned events before." In particular, it references this article on how suspension was used in the Paris-Roubaix and how the culture didn't appreciate suspension at first. They also note that current bike design focuses more on tube shaping and carbon fiber. 

Most hubs are same size both sides (9 quarter inch bearings). If they aren't, normally its the smaller ones on the freehub side (slightly smaller than the other side, maybe by a 32nd of an inch) and the larger ones are like a quarter inch and on the opposite side. 

(You) Have more than one bicycle. (Shop) Lend bicycles instead. This isn't too expensive for a repair shop to do -- keep a few durable and basic bicycles on hand and lend them out. Charge for it. (Shop) Restrict to the first class of repairs (and maybe part of the second class) and have people go there by bicycle in some small radius around the shop, since you probably won't make the money back on cars. Charge a good premium. (You) Try different shops. 

There is a technical difference between a cassette and a freewheel. A freewheel contains the ratcheting mechanism while a cassette sits on a freehub which contains the ratcheting mechanism. It clearly says in that toolkit's page "shimano cassette removal tool". The MF-TZ21 is a freewheel. So Park Tool FR-1 is the right tool. They also have excellent instructions on changing your freewheel here. 

Shimano does still make new cranksets which are JIS tapered in the Sora line, but if you want something fancier, you'll have to go with an older used crankset. You can always get nice new replacement chainrings if they're a bit worn. Edit: Just saw the outboard bottom bracket page from Phil Wood. Its expensive, but I think it may work depending on the crankset you want to use. 

Rear derailleur's speed markings are generally for marketing purposes - if you're under 10 speed in Shimano, you can swap between road and mountain rear derailleurs without problems provided they have enough capacity for the rear cog combination you're using - the cable pull is the same, so road and mountain shifters can't tell the difference (often in fact, you'll see touring bikes or road bikes with big rear cogs with Shimano Deore derailleurs since the mountain derailleurs can have bigger cogs in the back at the cost of a few grams of extra weight and looking less cool). The speed number you can effectively ignore, since the amount the derailleur moves is determined by the amount the shifters pull the cable (in theory, the cage might be thinner or something, but in practice this doesn't really matter). You also won't notice a difference in performance or anything if you just stuck a Claris rear derailleur on. It would just be a waste of money. If you want 8 speeds, you need to buy an 8 speed cassette (Shimano compatible) and an 8 speed Shimano shifter for the rear. You can keep the existing derailleur - you just need to adjust it a bit. You'll need some special tools (cassette remover, cable cable cutter, big crescent wrench) in addition to hex keys in order to do this as well. Swap the shifter and put the cassette on, adjust the derailleur and you've got an 8 speed setup. Personally, I think you should just stick with 7 speeds as it is sufficient for commuting (the extra speed doesn't really help - its just a bit easier to find 8 speed parts these days, so thats pretty much the only reason to go from 7 to 8). Spend your money on beer or something instead. The Cannondale Quick 6 is a relatively cheap hybrid (~500 dollars new), so if you want something faster, you're probably better off getting a different bike with probably more aggressive gearing and geometry (say a flat bar road bike like the Giant Escape or something if you want to stick with flat bars). 

You need a freewheel remover tool which fits the cog you have. Park Tool makes a lot of these, and has some excellent directions for replacing the freewheel here (and in the unlikely event you can't get a remover tool which works, there is a destructive way of removing freewheels, which is a last resort - we will assume you have the tool). Sheldon Brown also has some directions here. Roughly speaking what you'll do is you'll look at the freewheel you have, buy the appropriate freewheel remover tool and a large crescent wrench or similar. Then, you'll put the freewheel remover tool into the notches on the freewheel and snug up your quick release skewer / axle nut to hold it in place. Then, using a crescent wrench or vise, turn counterclockwise for 1 turn of the freewheel remover tool, and then remove the QR skewer / axle nut. Then, use the crescent wrench / vise to remove the freewheel the rest of the way (still counterclockwise). Installing the new freewheel is straightforward - apply anti-seize, thread it onto to the mounting threads (take care not to cross thread) all the way, and you're done. It will feel weird at first, but as you ride more, the freewheel will tighten down on the hub. You can also use a chain whip (clockwise) to tighten it down all the way if you want, before you ride (this will prevent the weird feeling). 

You can essentially inflate the tube out as much as you want until it pops. If you over inflate it before mounting it, it wont fit. Try using less air. Generally, also, tubes are marked for a certain size of tires, so try to match that too (if the tube is too big of a size, you may have it fold over itself, while if its too small the tube may be effectively a bit thinner than you like, but there is some tolerance in this - one or two sizes either way from the tire probably won't make a difference provided you're using the right diameter and both the tire and tube are sold as fractions or decimals). 

In some areas of the world, cars are allowed to use snow chains (or cables) in order to increase traction on ice and snow. This is slightly complicated on bicycles, but has been done. The main problems seem to be the chain being fixed to the tire while avoiding the rims (for brakes; presumably this can be relaxed for bikes with disc brakes to grab around the rims). As an alternative to installing tire chains, various manufacturers have been selling snow socks (wraps) for car tires, which are temporary stretchable covers for your tires designed to increase traction in winter driving conditions without having to install chains or specific winter tires. While I haven't used them, they seem to be helpful for occasional cases where all season tires are not comfortably enough. It seems like some of them work on changing texture due to water absorption due to tire heating (which I don't think will happen on a bicycle, but depending on absorption rate, could be pre-treated with warm water before riding), while others start textured. 

Since you didn't put a picture, I'm going to guess it is not significantly dented enough to worry about it (in which case, I'd just leave it alone since anything else will be uglier), but you should take it to a bike shop to get a professional opinion (so everything here is obviously all at you're own risk). One way is the ShelBroCo Dent Removal System (joke). A more serious overview from Sheldon Brown's site is here. For seat tubes and head tubes, you can try from the inside to press the dent out but I don't see you you could do it on the downtube. Frame blocks (made by companies like Bicycle Research, though you could make your own if you have access to a machine shop quite easily) are one solution. They're essentially 2 machined pieces of metal which you clamp over the tube and rotate the frame to try to push the tube back into shape. An example is here. Note that this will strip the paint off that area as well. Bondo is another solution. The extreme solution is to replace the tube (or part of it). 

Just because a wheel is buckled doesn't mean that it can't be fixed. You may want to take it to a bike shop. As for will the wheel fit, first note that you'll need 6 speed shifters unless you're using friction shifters. As for the wheel actually fitting, you need to check the hub spacing -- for example, 5 speed rear wheels for road bikes normally use 120 mm spacing while 6 speed use 126 mm spacing. Measure your frame's spacing and buy accordingly. If the frame is steel, you can often cold-set it to take the wider wheel (which is what you'll likely need to do if you're going from 5 speed to 6 speed). 

Different lubes will have different characteristics with respect to durability - some will do better in wet or muddy environments while others may do better in dry or dusty environments. First, note that chain maintenance is a matter of religious belief. The other bike store people are correct in this case - dry lube is designed for bikes which operate in dry conditions (so they dry to something thin and waxy to prevent dust collection - normally these are something like wax or teflon or something suspended in alcohol or something that evaporates out), but does not work as well as their wet lube (which is just some grease/oil) in wet conditions. The key thing is to lubricate well, and remove excess lubricant to minimize grime. Generally, companies which produce more than one lubricant will market them based on their intended operating conditions (whether they work better than the others in a given operating condition has to be determined experimentally). You can look at the back of the bottles to see what the manufacturer suggests. The longevity of any lubricant is highly dependent on operating conditions, and the longevity of a chain is a function of how clean it is as well as how lubricated it is. You may want to experiment with different lubes as to what works well for your riding conditions as well as invest in a chain cleaner such as the Park Tool GC2. Generally though, wet lubes last longer than dry lubes but do attract dirt more easily. Also, its Finishline presumably rather than Frontline (which makes flea+heartworm medicine for dogs). 

The tire clearance to the chainstay here is the distance from the sidewall of the tire to the chainstays where the tire and chainstays are closest together. 

Plus a V-brake with sufficient adjustment. Another option I've seen (which I wouldn't recommend) is people taking a rectangle of metal, mounting the brake pad at the top of the rectangle, then attaching the bottom of the metal to where the brake pad is normally mounted. This likely results in a good loss of braking power, plus you have to make sure the mount is very secure. 

The standard advice if you want to ride a mountain bike on the road is to fit slick tires rather than knobby tires, and lock out any suspension if you have it (since you don't need it on the road). That being said, you're going to typically have lower gearing than a road or hybrid bike (due to the nature of mountain biking), though you may have some room to adjust this with cassette and chainring sizes. At the end of the day, if you're going to be using this bike only on the road, it isn't going to be as nice as an appropriately hybrid or cyclocross or road bike, and it would be preferable not to get a mountain bike. Note that hybrids/cross bikes are often suitable for things like fire roads, gravel and what not (light off road situations); they won't take well to dropping as much as a mountain bike, but you have to ask yourself if this bike is ever really going to do this (and whether you'd be better off just renting a mountain bike when you want to do this, or buying a mountain bike specifically for this purpose).
