Yes. Among humans there is some correlation between brain size and IQ: "Our results showed significant positive associations of brain volume and IQ (r = .24, R2 = .06) that generalize over age (children vs. adults), IQ domain (full-scale, performance, and verbal IQ), and sex." The standard deviation in brain size is on the order of 100cc and the average volume around 1400cc, as far as I know. So just tripling human brain size should lead to IQ-gains of 2*1400*0.06*15/100=25.2 points. Tripling the size in every dimension would be a 27-fold increase. Of course that correlation doesn't necessarily hold in a range far beyond the human range, so there might be diminishing returns. Now, as has been mentioned, correlation isn't causation. But in this case it probably is, because big brains come with two distinct disadvantages: You have trouble getting born and you have a very high energy consumption baseline. So, evolutionary big brains have to pay for their existence somehow, and the only likely way seems to be higher intelligence (of whatever form). And of course if brain size-iq is too "pseudo scientific" for you, the same argument works with height. The effect will be a lot weaker because height only increases in one dimension, but still 16 points, which makes sense in the context of a story. 

Look at the Front Range of Colorado. Not a desert, but it gives you good parallels. If the mountains are RIGHT THERE, you have access to the water, vegetation, habitat for animals... traveling along the mountains on the desert side is easier, you can see for a very long way... so you have feasibility and a good reason to be there... harder to defend if invaded from the mountain side, but probably not to detrimental. Its seems practical and reasonable. 

Organic speech changes over time. If the androids were programmed to be able to track and adapt to variations in speech, which they almost certainly would be, this is a non-issue. The androids are capable of learning new slang and dialectical variations at least as fast as teenagers. The critical thinking and decision making involved with making deals is actually considerably more complicated. I would expect it MUCH more likely the androids would succumb to charlatans and predatory exchange rates LONG before they were challenged by shifting languages. 

A massive release of Iron in oceans, via e.g. tectonic processes. Iron binds oxygen, forming iron oxides (that's how we get iron ores). This consumes a lot of oxygen. Augment it with carbonate-bicarbonate process that flushes carbon monoxide out of atmoshpere and into the ocean, and plants don't have enough CO2 to replenish oxygen with. 

Conscripts are fighting to avoiding turning back on their comrades. I've heard that it's the primary motivation. You might have zero incentive to risk your life, save that your inactivity will cause your pal, who you leave unprotected, will be slaughtered easily by enemy forces. Of course that won't work if everybody in the troop has zero or negative motivation, and everybody just pretend to fight. I've heard Syrian army fights like that. 

The most effective method for contraception will be infant mortality. Mind you, there will be enough for it for fertility cults to occur. Avoiding pregnancy will be considered as throwing money out of window would, today. 

It might be an interesting challenge, but a curious experiment... but even at the time, the south insisted the north didn't care about slavery, they were just using it to galvanize their people into action. Assuming slavery WASN'T as important as independence/taxes/commerce as they claimed there is a move they didn't pursue. The south could pre-emptively abolish slavery... sorta. They could replace it (as is the way of our species) with something that was nearly the same thing (a company store creating debt slavery, for instance). Their "property" becomes "free" but has little choice but to continue to work for basically nothing, while knocking the arguments of the north out from under them. It would be a lot harder to rally people to fight and die for interstate commerce regulation. Of course, it does NOTHING to correct the moral issues related to the conflict... in fact, it probably puts in place structures that would take much much longer to deconstruct... but it could stop the war itself. Todd... if he could use his skills to become important and valuable enough to the confederacy, he could eventually get the ears of those who could hear the logic and be led to make those decisions. 

I invite you to take a look at the bone structure of the hero shrew. This little creature can survive being stepped on by a grown man, but from the outside it looks like any other shrew. Similar modifications of the human backbone are probably necessary to live in high g environments for any extended period of time. Also, shrews are generally pretty awesome. I'm just saying echolocation, venom, eating scorpions, monster metabolism … well, maybe don't splice it all in. 

There is one very realistic scenario: Embryo selection. In IV fertilisation usually around ten embryos are created, because a number of them is not going to be viable and the egg extraction is not a process you would want to undergo several times. If you had a way to choose the embryo with the highest cognitive potential, kids conceived that way would on average be noticeable smarter than random picks. So several things have to happen: 

Abundant resources, low/weak predation, female dominant breed selection. You look at peaceful megafauna and they tended to get there by simply having enough to grow larger, and predators that couldn't easily take them... There are multitudes of variations on how this could happen. Think of an evolutionary path where the "smaller" ones would get killed or die, leaving the larger ones to continue to breed. As long as the environment can support the increase in dietary/shelter/space needs relatively easily, they can grow larger. This isn't too far from what you see in disparate races here on earth, different environments have different requirements of our bodies skin tone, muscle mass, and size until they become "traits" of our heritage... your world just takes it to another order of magnitude. Ensuring that the females are fighting over the males, or at least choosing the males in a method other than who can punch who the hardest, will remove the genetic benefit of males growing larger. === Edit for the clarification about the "matriarchal" requirement === You get larger females the same way you get larger males... have them fight each other. It benefits a male to have a breeding pool, multiple females he can keep pregnant and safe... A matriarchal society tends not to fight over males... cause why? There is no genetic advantage to them keeping a harem. There is no "downtime" for the male where he will need a strong female to provide for him or protect him. You would have to find a motivation, a genetic one, not a social one, to enable this. Extremely long (months) refractory periods where the males are not only unable to breed, but maybe too lethargic to hunt or protect themselves? Even then, at that point the female, biologically speaking already has what she needs, there is no reason to "protect" the male... she can just find a new one later. An argument could be made that the females have to be bigger and sturdier to be capable in a predatory environment during pregnancy... but that only makes sense if the males are somehow not able to provide them with safety. This doesn't add up... whatever time it took for the females to get stronger would make the males stronger as well. The "easiest" way would be socially... but there would have to be cultural motivations in place for tens of thousands of years before this would be significant... which is extremely unlikely. 

An easy solution to your dilemma would be a one-way-road. A stretch of land that is only passable in one direction. A wide fast flowing river surrounded by impenetrable forest would be an obvious candidate for this scenario. In that case your travellers would travel in a circle and part of that circle would be the river: A very fast and convenient way to travel … but only in one direction. Travelling on this river could easily be more than ten times faster than hiking back trough the (dangerous) woods. So the kids would only have to stay hidden for a few days, which is probably more realistic than waiting for the seasons to change. 

So if we ramp it up to 30 points aka 2 standard deviations per generation you'll get your 60 standard deviations in the next thousand years. Politically this has to be tied in with the elimination of genetic diseases and risk factors for diseases. It's not a designer baby, because you don't actually change anything. You just help your kid to be the most healthy, intelligent and happy kid you can have. Overall however, adoption will be driven by competition. The asian countries will start and the western countries will decide not to be left in the dust. Stephen Hsu blogs about this in great detail. 

Imagine someone putting a battleship over a country, always in sight, in order to threaten them to not try anything funny. Imagine tech that allows to suspend the ship is not a problem. How high is it possible to put a starship in the atmosphere in order for it to be visible clearly on sunny day? As a dark figure cast against clear sky. What's the radius in which it will be visible, on the ground, assuming Earth is the planet? What size should the ship be in order to be the size of moon from the surface? UPD: To clarify. It's not the ship's size that is a problem. It's the atmosphere. It scatters light from the sun, otherwise the skies will be dark. But, this means if we place ship outside atmosphere, it will probably not be visible unless directly between the sun and observer. Let's agree that the ship does not shine (is dark) and is visible because it blocks or absorbs light.
