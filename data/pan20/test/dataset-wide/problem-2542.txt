On page 111 in What Buddhists Believe by Ven. K. Sri Dhammananda there is a short section about Nama-Rupa. Maybe it can help you out. Ven. K. Sri Dhammanda talks about the definition of both nama & rupa. He says: 

Undertaking the practice of Samatha meditation, should be done for the sake of the practice itself - not for seeking out pleasant experiences. The minute one is thinking about achieving and gaining pleasant experiences, one has fallen into the hindrances. As a result of that, one has moved away from the primary object of meditation and thus are not cultivating concentration any longer. It comes down to ones intentions for doing the practice. Its a good idea to regularly clarify and affirm ones intentions for practicing - especially with Samatha meditation, that is very important. Its easy to become attached to the pleasant sensations this type of meditation practice can result in. One should ask oneself why one takes on this practice. A wholesome intention is essential. Wholesome intentions for engaging in Samatha meditation could be: 

Im looking for a specific sutta in the Majjhima Nikaya. In the sutta past and future is being discussed and also how a practitioner on the insight path can gain seclusion from the 5 aggregates. Help would be much appreciated. Lanka

I found a book on google books explaining what a "Headman" is and how he is elected. It's not possible to quote from the book so here is a screenshot and a link to the source. In short it says that a headman is elected by other villagers and that his asignments are administrative tasks in a village. He has other tasks too since in some litterature it's mentioned that he takes care of business when e.g. someone has stolen something in a village. Here is link to a book wherein a headman must make a decision about a wandering monk who has stolen twice. So it sounds like a headman is the authoritative figure of a village. A boss of some sort. 

Both the interdependency and interrelatedness of phenomena are profound things. They cannot be fully grasped or understood by the intellect. It can be helpful to think about these things in order to grapple with them but that is the limit. When practicing insight meditation and thereby transforming the intellectual "book knowledge" into experiental knowledge is what creates understanding of reality. When reality is taken as an meditation object insight into how reality functions can arise. Think about it like going to a restaurant and reading about all the dishes on the menu cart. Can one then understand the flavour of the food? What if one reads the menu cart, orders the food and then eats the food. Can one then understand the flavour or the food? The last option is the experiental knowledge while the first option only gives access to intellectual knowledge which will only give one the ability to peek through the door. The last option will give one the ability to open the door and walk into the room. There is a chinese school of Buddhism called Huayan School of Buddhism which you can take a look at. They "specialize" in the interdependency/interrelatedness of phenomena. In there is also the story about Lord Indra and his Jewelled net. In short the story goes that Lord Indra has in his palace a big 3D net of jewels and in each interslice there is a jewel. When looking at that jewel you can see the entire net of jewels and when looking in the jewel of the superficial jewel again you can see the entire net of jewels. That goes on ad infinitum. This is called infinite regress. You can look at interdependency of phenomena by using the method of analysis and thereby looking at phenomena at a minute basis - like looking at them in a microscope. In insight meditation one can clearly see that phenomena are caused by other phenomena and that phenomena arises on basis of other phenomena. Phenomena cannot become established by themselves. The fact that conditioned reality changes all the time can be seen. The impermanence is due to the fact that phenomena are being set up by other phenomena. Another way to look at it is by looking a detail and context. Take a tree for example. The tree consists of bark, leaves, trunk, flower. But the tree in a way also consists of rain water, sunlight and earth. Without these non-tree elements there is no tree. So phenomena are merely reflections of other phenomena and no "single, permanent or unchangable" phenomena can be found in the conventional reality. Lanka 

This can be a tricky question to answer. You see practice and development is different from person to person. That is because people are different. We have different kamma and have done a variety of past deeds in this life and previous lives. This means that its very difficult to give a broad description of lets say how much time people have for practice and thereby how long it will take for them to develop a strong concentration. Some have a lot of time while others have shorter time. Others have a lot of time to practice but also has a lot of mental resistance that keeps them from developing. Regarding the mental resistance people can have when practicing the dhamma there are the five hindrances. They are what keep beings from developing in meditation and thereby achieving the focused state you are asking about. You can read more about the five hindrances and there antidotes here And here is an absolutely fantastic audio dhamma talk on the five hindrances by Ven. Bhikkhu Bodhi. Here is part 1 and part 2. In brief the five hindrances are: 

If his intentions are wholesome, then yes of course. Even a small amount of wholesome intention, serves to strengthen the Adhiṭṭhāna (resolution) pāramī. 

The sutta you are looking for can be found in the MN 8 - Sallekha Sutta: Effacement. Here the Buddha gives the following teaching to Ven. Cunda: 

Anatta is one of the 3 marks of existence. The others being; anicca and dukkha. The whole teaching is the "most" important. One cannot just take out a piece of the teaching. It does not work like that. The Noble Eightfold Path is a complete teaching that needs nothing to be added or removed from it. Sila, Samadhi, Panna. All groups are needed in order to win Nibbana. 

One can deal with each of the 5 hindrances in 5 ways, i.e. the following 5 methods works for all of the hindrances. Methods are found in The Noble Eightfold Path, p. 63-66, by Ven. Bhikkhu Bodhi. 

As we see here Nāgasena explains that Time exists for beings that will be reborn, i.e. beings that are still wandering in the realm of Samsara. Time does not exist for beings that will not get reborn, i.e. those who have won Nibbana. 

Here is a video on "Vegetarianism and Killing" by Ven. Yuttadhammo. The video discusses buddhist ethics from a point of view of ultimate reality. It is talked about why killing is unethical and how it affects ones own state of mind and what kind of vegetarianism one could practice. Here is an interesting article with the title "Life as a Vegetarian Tibetan Buddhist Practitioner - A Personal View" by Eileen Weintraub. Here is a short quote from the article: 

The stable, the secure, the wonderful, freedom, the shelter.. I don't know about other beings, but these words/reasons seem pretty compelling to me. 

If you would like to find peace in an idea or question then the peace you find will only be temporary since concepts are conditioned phenomena that are impermanent, ungovernable and unreliable. If you practice for example tranquility meditation its possible to achieve deep calm and silence which i think you mean by peace. These are considered very beautiful states but they are also impermanent meaning you will loose that peace at one point in time. Futhermore there is the possiblity that you will develop attachment towards these states and want more of them which will lead to addiction. Here you have the 2th noble truth; that suffering is caused by craving, tanha - thirst. That is why its not advisable to try to find peace in conditioned phenomena since they are subject to arising and ceasing without any form of control and are therefore transient, momentary and impermanent. They are oppressing and inflict suffering if they are identified with or taken ownership of. If you would like to find peace you should try to understand reality. Problems are overcome by understanding them and understanding comes through observation of reality. Insight meditation is the tool you want to use in order to penetrate into reality and achieve understanding. Peace will come when you understand how reality works. Lanka 

Here is a quote from "The Jhanas" by Ajahn Brahmavamso. In here he gives the following techniques to stabilize the nimitta. He also discusses a suitable and a useless nimitta, how to shine it up and how to disturb a stable nimitta: 

I echo what Suminda and Sankha has already mentioned. Be cautious about what you hear or read. I doubt that the Buddha was born in Sri Lanka. Personally, I don't believe it to be true. As Sankha mentioned - it might be a tactic to gain followers.
