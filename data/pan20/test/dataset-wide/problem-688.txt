I am contemplating riding from New Jersey, across the George Washington Bridge, across Manhattan, into Queens and on to work in Long Island. I am already spending up to 2 hours on the drive due to traffic, and I think it will take me about 2.5 to 3 hours on the bike. I am considering doing it one way. My concern is possible routes across Long Island. I only need to get out to Bethpage, between the Northern State/Southern State highways. Looking at maps, it seems that my best option is Queensboro bridge (Aka 59th St, aka Koch bridge) to Queens Boulevard, and then stay on 25A which changes names, pretty much the whole way out there. My concern is whether this is a rideable road. Last summer I was lucky enough to be able to ride 30+ miles to Parsipanny, NJ, and riding along Rt 46 where it has a paved shoulder was a dream come true! The trucks and cars zipping by just dragged me along. A pleasure. But I have never even driven Queens Blvd, and do not really have time to try it. Google Maps, selecting bike routing has a convoluted, complicated, longer route, trying to hit parks and bike paths as best it can. So to make this more relevant, I am looking for a good bike route, out of Manhattan and across Long Island. 

Personally for me, the key ingredient (after raw calories) is salt. I find on my Ironman distance races that I go hyponatremic pretty early. I just get salt packets from a restaurant and eat a packet (5 grams) every hour or so. When I realize I am low on salt (usually feel like I am falling asleep while biking hard or running) I eat some salt, and as soon as it touches my tongue I start to feel better. 

I think that a distinction needs to be made between a Podcast and music. I think that listening to talk is ok while riding, and will do that. Or I will talk on the phone, since my 'music' device is my Blackberry. Music however is different than talk. Talk is usually quieter, not as continuous, and easy to hear car and traffic noises over it as background noises. After reading the comments, I guess I need to say, that the above works for me. Others may experience talk vs music differently than I do. 

The freewheel allows forward pedalling to lock and drive the bike, but spins freely when reversed. Some BMX style bikes (and kids bikes) have coaster brakes, where if you pedal backwards (well usually they do not actually pedal backwards, just the motion is begun) and it brakes the bike. I remember well locking the back wheel and trying to generate skid marks on the sidewalk. 

If you mistreat a rim, you can destroy it pretty quickly. For winter riding in Toronto, I used to just accept I was going to destroy a mountain bike every 2-3 years. One horrible MTB end of life event was climbing a hill in the snow and the steer tube just twisted into a figure 8 and I went over the bars. (Oddly enough my coworkers were driving by and dragged me into the office). But the worst was a rim failure in traffic. My brake pads, with all the winter grit accumulated had worn through the sides of the rim, and one last brake attempt and the pad locked into the rim, tearing off a strip of metal, and sending me over the handlebars. I had enough sense as soon as I hit the ground to roll into the snow bank to avoid the cars. Also, I was close enough to the office to carry the bike back, get some work dry clothes on and take a bus home. But a rim can fail badly, if you treat it poorly. It was entirely my own fault. But winter riding can be hard on a bike, and hard to do proper maintenance. 

The Toronto Bike show is great, I have gone many times. I actually will be there on Sunday as well. Enjoy seeing the bikes, the BMX stunt shows, and all the groups showing their group ride routes. But bring lots of cash. Lots of deals for cash to be had. Look at bike shops bargain bins for parts you might need cheap. I usually go looking for close outs on clothing, since I have gotten amazing deals that way before. 

The expense is usually due to the physical hardware needed. Somewhere along the way some device needs to measure the power output. But how? Well inside the hub seems like the most common version. Thus you need a wheel build around a 'heavier' hub to get this to work, and thus is never cheap. Polar had a power sensor I never could figure out how it worked, but it had an external sensor along the drive train side back stay. It supposedly watched the chain tension, on top of cadence and wheel speed to calculate power. But that silly sensor was close to $500 or more at the time I looked at it. Still seemed like Voodoo to me, personally. A friend relied on it, and thought it was pretty good and accurate. ANT+ is just a data transport protocol, which makes the send/receive module cheaper and more common, but for power, the rest of the sensor is the expensive part. 

My experience with riding 12 years through the winter in Toronto is that your bike is going to get ruined. Find a source for reasonable to cheap better mountain bikes and be ready to discard them after 2 or 3 winters at most. I found a couple of things helpful. 

My dad taught me, my two sisters, my neices and nephews the same basic way. On grass. Get them on a two wheeler, no training wheels, but with helmet on, and start em up on the grass. Find a field that is smooth (maybe a slight downhill to start on) and push them and let them go. Grass is harder to ride on, but soft enough to fall on without damage that will get Mommy mad. 

I rode all year round in Toronto, Ontario, Canada for about 10 years. What I found most useful was warm boots. I wore winter boots like the ones shown. Though that link is to the -40C version. I also used the -70C version. Which in -35C weather (-31F) are actually quite comfy. I found that the ankles rotated without a problem, and I could ride in them. In wet weather, tucking water proof pants over the tops of the boots made for a very comfortable ride. 

I think M. Werner is probably correct. However, there is one additional thing (at least) that can cause this skipping. Are any of your links in your chain stuck? If you have a pair of links that are jammed and not bending well, as they run over the gears they can behave as you describe. 

The one thing I hate most about loosing my hair is coming back from a ride with lines on my head burned in. Sunblock is how I handle it. 

Doesn't really matter. Just try to avoid really wet places. I have left bikes in the garage for years. Or for months at a time between rides. (Road bike during the winter, while I ride my MTB to work, and vica versa). I have left them standing on the floor. Hanging from both wheels in the ceiling. I recall a thread on hanging from just the front wheel and consensus was it did not matter. 

This primarily comes up as the pressures in the tires get higher. With lower pressure wider tires, Schrader makes the most sense, if only because you can hit a gas station for some air pressure. Presta makes more sense on higher pressure tires, since it allows you to pump in higher levels with a floor pump. Per the comments let me try and clarify. When you use a Schrader stem the valve is depressed by a thingy in the pump head the whole time. With a mechanical constant pressure pump (like at a gas station) this is fine. But with a floor pump where there is a pause between pumps, Presta works better because each time you release pressure, the valve head closes. Then as you build pressure in the pump, when it exceeds the tires current pressure it forces the value to open, allows air in, and repeat. Thus you can pump to higher pressures with it. (Or at least with poorer quality pumps. But if it bothers you, get the little one dollar adapters, and you can use a car pump with no issue. 

Having lived in Toronto, I have kept my helmet in the attached garage, for year round riding with winter temps down to -20C being common, and summer temps of +30C being common. I replace my helmets every couple of years, as others have noted the adhesives fail, though in my case, probably more from sweat corroding the glue than just the heat. 

I can offer an anecdote that suggests that proper maintenance is a good thing! My winter bike, which I just barely maintained, as I wore them down into the ground and then threw them out, riding all winter long in Toronto. I also only bought cheap junk bikes to do this with. Better bikes for nicer weather. As others have noted, letting the pads wear down, or dirt between the pads and the rim can easily destroy a rim. Twice (I should have learned) I had the brakes pierce the rim, get buried, and I flew over the handlebars. Once onto the sidewalk, once onto the road. It was dumb, and painful. Don't do it. 

I agree with the other answers, but think one subtle detail is important. It depends on the type of snow. Eskimos have 50 words for snow? Well there really are different types. Light and fluffy is easy. Deep and heavy gets to be problematic. There comes a point, where each forward motion is wasted as the wheel spins, while sinking down through the snow up ahead, till it hits the bottom where it can get traction. That is very hard riding if it is possible at all. I am not sure how to discuss the very different types of snow to really answer this question completely. 

Its only 13K, so you do not need to much of a warm up. However, the purpose of a warm up is two fold. One get your aerobic system going, and second to get exercise specific muscles warmed up. For the first, you can go for a light jog (not in your bike shoes please!) and for the second, it is best to ride to match the muscles, and running muscles are sufficiently different, that I would focus on a light jog, not too long (10-15 minutes) and not much more. 

There is a drive shaft bike available. Heck there is even a Wikipedia entry on it. I have never tried riding one. But the thing about bicycles is they are pretty darn good, as currently designed. Brake innovations have come and gone (things like disc brakes on MTB's). I am sure there are more. 

I cannot recommend a specific model, there are way too many products. I have a Cyclops Fluid trainer that is ok. I hate riding a trainer, it is too dang hot indoors for me. The tripod stands most trainers use look less stable than you would imagine, but they really can be quite stable. With a fluid trainer, the harder you ride, the harder the resistance. So actually spinning fast is pretty hard to do on it. Most of the tripod style ones, the support legs fold back to the frame, so it is as thick as the resistance mechanism is thick. I would NOT get a wind trainer! Even the fluid trainer I have is louder than I would like, but the other options are louder. 

Presta's main benefit is more about how the valve functions, in regards to getting pumped up to higher pressures. Because the stem of the valve needs pressure in the pump head to get high enough before it pushes the valve stem in, and start flowing air into the tire, when you try to get to 120 to 160 lbs of pressure it works better than a Schrader valve where the valve stem is depressed the whole time, back pressure can leak out. Otherwise I would say tomato - tomahto (potato - potaato?) 

I think your general GPS concern for accuracy is reasonable, but it is the same worldwide, not just outside the US. The full GPS constellation is in orbit with spares, so there is world wide 3-D coverage of the planet. It happens that there are moments in time in any arbitrary location, where the coverage could be better, and the US military has a group that actually forecasts these for their armed forces. I.e. Do not try a precision bomb drop at a moment that the satellite configuration is not optimal. GPS has other issues (trees, buildings, clouds) that get in the way. As Billy ONeal notes, wheel sensors are not perfect either. An example of GPS issues, occurred when two friends of mine with Garmin Forerunner 201's (GPS only devices) on their arms ran a known measured half marathon course side by side, and had a 4K discrepancy at the end of it! (We blame firmware for that one). So firmware can make a big difference on GPS devices. I would be very interested in comparing results from a GPS and wheel sensor on a longer ride. 

Hydraulics are the same for car brakes, as for these style brakes, as anywhere else in the physical universe. Liquids have an amusing property that they do not compress well, if at all. (They do of course compress, but not very much in the grand scheme of things, and it takes a lot of pressure to noticeably compress them). Thus your hand started breaking force is transmitted direct to the brake, through the medium of the fluid. If the fluid is getting viscous, due to cold weather, it might become thicker, and thus less responsive to your hand pressure. The reason to bleed air out of the system is that air compresses very nicely, thank you, unlike a liquid, and so destroys the hydraulic principle in use. Bleeding in this context means to release any trapped air inside the hydraulic cylinder. Same as in car brakes. First the air compresses, absorbing much of the energy being applied to brake, until finally the liquid starts to transmit the energy. 

I wear sunblock all the time, because I burn easily, as much as cancer concerns. Alas, one to watch for, as you get older and lose hair, is to remember sunblock under the helmet, else you get burn lines. 

My wife bought a Stryder bike, which is a two wheeler, with no pedals/crank/chain/etc. My son sits on it, pushes and brakes with his feet. He rode about 40 miles this summer on it. (The pool is about a 3 mile round trip from our house, and we rode there a fair bit). Now he glides and balances very well. We have to get him a real bike this summer, to save money on worn out shoes from breaking with his feet. I am not sure this would work with an adult/non-child but it seems to be working well on my son. (Started at 2.5 and still riding it now as a 4 year old). We plan on skipping training wheels altogether.
