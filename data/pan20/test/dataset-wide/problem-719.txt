Can't shift down from 50T with clutch on, but can shift down with clutch off, why? I'm using sunrace 11-50 and XT RD-M8000 (SGS), finished setting up everything for absolutely perfect shifting, then realised the clutch was off. Turned it on, shifting is still excellent (but with the usual clutch effect) except it will not shift out of 50T. The shifter clicks, the RD stays put, same thing if I do multiple shifts down. I can however backpedal for a while after one downshift to drop the chain into the 42T, the RD then moves, after which I can pedal forward and carry on shifting down perfectly. This is not a derailleur setup issue, not only have I got everything setup by the book, but I've played around with 4mm to 12mm gaps between the 50T and top pulley with B-screw with no luck. My calculations (full formula including 2 links for derailleur, not rough estimate) showed that 113.4 (=114) links on the chain should be enough, I installed with 117 links initially, felt that was too much chain, removed 2 links and am using 115 now. Doubt it's chain length, can't see why everything would be fine with clutch off if it's chain length, but worth considering. RD is just out of the box, so I doubt it's the Nm on the clutch, but going to check that out soon. It's not a big issue, since there are only 2 to 5 (depending on conditions) places where I need/want the 50T and all of them are during the (mostly) climbing half of my local rides, so I can ride up with clutch off and ride down with it on. Above all I'm curious why extra chain tension from clutch could cause this; even if the Clutch tension is too high and that is the reason, why would this happen? After all, it shifts even under quite a lot of load with clutch off (I avoid this bad shifting practice where possible, I was just testing!) 

Edit: To Clarify this is regarding going as fast as possible, i.e. racing, off-road. I can't see why "modulation" matters so long as you have enough to apply near maximum braking force without locking the wheel. Surely the brakes should always be used to near maximum stopping power, while using the duration of application to give the desired deceleration in as little time as possible (as late as possible)? Wouldn't any other approach be inefficient and result in riding slower? I have held this (logically derived) belief for a while and been around similarly minded people, but recently I have come across a surprising amount of people who always go on about modulation when brakes are being discussed and how they need great modulation to get "just the braking power they want". Is their preference a matter of what they want trumping what they actually need for maximum efficiency? I was always led to believe (with sensible reasoning) that dabbing or feathering brakes or in any way applying them, to anything other than near maximum capacity, is simply incorrect brake use (when efficiency is at stake.) Am I missing something? 

If you are happy getting your hands dirty then the model of your rear hub/brake is needed to provide accurate information. Until you open it up you won't know for sure if part of the brake is actually broken and replacement parts are needed or if just a service will suffice. However I would guess just a service is needed since you merely found it hard to pedal on a flat and did not mention variations in difficulty or other strangeness. Why it happened: You only really find this out while fixing it. It is impossible to accurately answer this with the information provided in your question, however assuming it is because the brake is no longer functioning correctly, I would guess: insufficient grease and/or rusted bearings and/or too much gunk and dirt in the hub. 

Yes. I do exactly this to the carbon bike almost every week just to check when I hear something even resembling a possible creak... well, that is if you ignore that I actually do something similar but even more stressful for the bike every single day; every time I take a corner fast in the woods and feel the tyres losing grip. So far checking out creaks this way has led me to tighten the BB once and to tighten the crank arms once. However usually it's actually a seat post related creak (sometimes still heard when doing the above). A quick clean and some mounting paste sorts out the post. If this procedure actually breaks your frame or something, then be happy, very happy. You avoided a serious injury. 

Trying not to mention what has already been said but: Gloves that wick well will also help to keep you cooler (and cut offs are not a significant disadvantage in this sense, due to surface area to volume ratios and blood flow.) The main reasons for choosing cut off gloves as opposed to less protective full finger gloves (given that both can keep you more or less equally cool if made out of the right materials) is partially personal preference, but often relates to better feel when dealing with zips, packed food/energy, gear adjustment and not having to take them off when working on the bike, some also claim a superior feel for the brakes. 

Edit: I agree with Criggie about the check list first, I just assume people check for the obvious, I probably shouldn't assume that though. What can you do to fix it: Unless you are happy getting your hands dirty and doing something like in the youtube link below then taking your bike to a bike shop would be the best option. 

You could fit 120mm, but you really shouldn't. You shouldn't even really be jumping on that bike shaped object. Hitting bigger jumps does not require more suspension unless you are doing it on the kind of terrain which that bike is not capable of handling. Hitting bigger jumps only requires more technique. If you are serious about getting into dirt jumping I would try to sell that bike, add some money, and get a 2nd hand dirt jump bike without any suspension and work on technique. 

Regarding the life of your freewheel/cassette: 1.5 years is a meaningless measure in biking but seems pretty good without further information to go on. Distance, riding style, riding conditions, maintenance, and attention to chain wear + chain replacement will all play a significant role in lifespan. For example: I've destroyed an SLX cassette (and chain) in 3 months and been quite happy with the lifespan, when considering all the factors that resulted in this "short" life span. 

Well actually, since they do not claim this 19 years of research has anything to do with the inventor, it would be more accurate to say it is based on over 70 years of research, much of it consisting of inflicting brain damage on monkeys. And why is it put in such a way that 19 years of research is followed by "extensive trials" (are they maybe trying to mislead you into thinking there have been 19 years of trials? And where is the data from these extensive trials? What does extensive even mean?) There is no single accepted figure of exactly how many rads/s^2 and for how many ms will cause concussion or DAI. The 1992 Study I cannot read without paying, but I am aware of a study that estimated 1.8k rads/s^2 for over 10ms for concussion and anything between 6 and 7k rads/s^2 impulse for DAI, any estimates are estimated from the primate experiments which must also have error bars in their measurements. With the figures I'm aware of, both helmets in that experiment leave you concussed and brain damaged, and there is no good reason to believe one set of figures is more accurate than the other. For the % figures they have, you have to consider the error bar in the primate measurements, the error bar in extrapolation to humans (this should be pretty huge but appears to have been ignored), and the error bars for their computer model, which should be HUGE, since it simplifies everything down to two points. For all i know the primate study simplified it down like this also. Just because you have over simplified your experiment to the over simplification of the angular momentum calculations in the other one does not mean you can just decide to cancel out the error in both, no, you must multiply the errors in both. Any despite all this there are NO ERROR BARS ON THE % GRAPH at all? And no consideration of possible flaws and issues with their experiment? One must then question the motivation of providing the oh so quotable lovely % based graph, which is so fundamentally useless... except for quoting "science" to "prove" that "maybe" something. AND THIS IS PEER REVIEWED?! That term used to actually MEAN something! Oh wait, this is medicine peer review. Most of them can't write up an experiment and don't know how to calculate error bars! So the % based graph is just the output of the guesses of a computer model based on guesses, without any care for potential errors hahahahaha! The figures i.e. "Evidence" are relevant ONLY to this exact situation and this is a very border line situation, they show ONLY that in this one situation this MAY improve the outlook by this or that much. Consider this: If you increase the forces a bit: concussion and DAI for everyone! If you decrease the forces a bit: maybe concussion but no DAI for everyone! Angle more oblique: Concussion and DAI for everyone! Angle less oblique: Maybe concussion but no DAI for everyone! So the range of configurations which are NOT borderline are clearly far greater! Now, how are the forces and angles of typical sets of realistic crashes in the real world distributed? I don't know, they don't know. Maybe these border line situations where the helmet makes a difference are extremely uncommon, it might make their % differences in just 0.01% of realistic crashes i.e. almost no difference whatsoever! What happens at a greater force? Sure you get this 34% reduction in angular momentum in this exact situation, but even at 1.1x the force, the reduction might be just 10%, we don't know how their aluminum honey comb responds. Maybe at lower force the reduction is also lower, maybe this experiment highlights the perfect sweetspot of MIPS, which itself is extremely unlikely to occur in a real collision. What about a surface that is not perfectly smooth? What about a bit of tarmac, some gravel, some 10 degree and 15 degree impacts, sliding on the side, clipping the front of the helmet on some rocks, different impact forces, initial rotations, what if the body is thrown into a spin around another axis? It's unreasonable to expect experiments for EVERYTHING, but to say "this may help this much" given the information they have, is even more ridiculous. The issue is that no one can measure all this stuff in any meaningful way (though there is NO excuse for only one angle and one force, especially not the ONE case, where everything is border line, without trying to show what the limits are i.e. at what point is it irrelevant which helmet you use, you will be concussed, and at which will you be brain damaged regardless) but anyone creating a system to "help solve the problem" already knows what people can and are likely to measure and how they are likely to measure it and can optimize their solution for the likely measurements. The whole state of helmets from the 1940s till 2010 was the result of there being no solution to DAI from angular momentum after it was identified as a serious issue. So instead, a weak solution for part of the problem was created, with the technology that existed, then the whole DAI and angular momentum thing was sort of forgotten. My worry is that, with a cheap to make, patented "maybe sort of solution", with this much marketing behind it, which may be somewhat effective in a limited unrealistic situation, that we may stop trying to tackle the problem and find a good solution, because hey, this technology now exists, we can sell it, we can say "hey look it moves", "hey look here's a graph and a bar chart", "awesome!" .... and while I hope this is better than what we had, I doubt the difference is at all meaningful, and am worried people won't search for something better, now that this market is taken, as people start to simply believe, as people tend to do. Still, I have no regrets, 30 euros extra was a small price for a maybe a little extra confidence, however misguided I may know it may be: There are studies that show that wearing a helmet encourages risk vs wearing a baseball cap, in situations where the risk taking is gambling based, not physical at all; the helmet is merely used to mount a camera (cap used for this purpose in the control) and since I guess one must be more confident to take greater risks, I believe the possibility of extra security will make me more confident in my riding all round. :) If only we were still back in the 1940s-1980s when it was still acceptable for scientists to brain damage monkeys. Then we could teach them to ride bikes and mow them down with HGVs, throw them down DH tracks, and get some real data. 

First of all, the standard shimano cup and cone bearing size is not necessary, take their own XTR FH-M975, this had 3/16th bearings in a rear hub. One thing I considered just now was that an MTB will sometimes be on only one of the hubs, so it is unlikely that there are issues to do with damaging either bearing size in this way. What is left is the typical average load distribution; bearing size and load are both factors in bearing life, as such my overall conclusion is actually that this is a bearing life issue more than anything else, they're simply attempting to obtain the same life from the front and rear. Even as bearings improve this provides a valid reason to keep the size disparity to increase rear bearing life. $URL$ Outside of cup and cone one can take the Hope Pro2 Evo for example, the front takes 20x32x7 while the rear takes 17x30x7, the bearings in both are the same size, but the rear has less of them. I'm guessing that the front only takes more bearings to increase the cartridge radius to accomodate larger axel standards. It's worth noting there are another 3 bearings in the freewheel of the hub, I'm unsure how this affects things, but then there are also bearings in the shimano freehub. Edit: Anecdotally the rear bearings on my pro2 evo needed replacing sooner than the front. The load really is significantly different: Lennard Zinn on measuring rear and front load, and "don't be surprised if it's 70/30" $URL$ For otherwise identical bearings the load it can take increases with size. $URL$ The above is not ideal as it deals with 6000 series cartridge bearings, where the number of bearings varies as well as their size, but it shows clearly that the the load rating increases with size of bearing (when the width increases). If you want to get more in depth with regard to anything and everything bearing related then check out and explore starting from $URL$ $URL$ EDIT: My final thought is that cup and cone are the staple of cheap hubs, any change would presumably increase costs (at least initially) and go against standard expectations for bearing sizes, any increase in cost to a manufacturer is passed on to the consumer, in the case of budget hubs there's really no advantage to the consumer for the increased cost, I mean, they work, they work very well for a very long time when maintained, and surprisingly well for surprisingly long even when they're not! Even if you could show this or that improvement in weight or rolling in an optimised hub, would this actually translate to more profit? I doubt it very much. So manufactures just keep things the way they've been, because there's no advantage to be had for the company by changing it. Also consider the complaints from people that you messed with bearing sizes, no doubt there will be enough people who will put the wrong bearings into the new hub, who will then proceed complain that your company sucks! There are countless examples of technically sub-optimal solutions everywhere you look, many of them are however optimal for profits. I strongly believe (but can't prove) that a simple philosophy that "both wheels should last equally long" was the main driving force behind the initial decision. 

Are there any studies on the effect of helmets and/or other impressions of the bike rider, on driver behaviour? Has anyone collected their own data on things like this? Has anyone noticed any other slightly unexpected oddities like the two I observed bellow? Recently I had to ride back home on a road down a 10km route which I've travelled many times before, but without a helmet, the difference in driver behaviour was very noticeable... I got a lot more space, didn't have a single car overtake me dangerously close (though a few were certainly still illegally close). I've noticed similar differences when i'm sort of practising riding skinnies by staying dead in the middle of the lines at the sides of roads (this seems to give drivers FAR too much confidence to act dangerously... I was already worried about this particular test after just one day, I was actually interested in getting hard data riding on the lines vs normally vs unstable and wobbly (against number of cars coming dangerously close (based on video)) unfortunately i only got as far as anecdotal evidence that skinny practice on road lines is dangerous as hell, that normal riding seems much safer and that wobbling about unstably does seem to make you safer from drivers, but it's easy to get carried away. Then as I was practicing skinnies some twatwaffle hit me with his wing mirror, putting me off balance, scaring the shit out of me, and ending my desire to gather data, while increasing my desire to keep away from asphalt in general. Those experiments ended, and I never thought about it much till the helmet incident recently... I'm certainly not intending to do the no helmet experiment myself, so I was wondering is there any real data for this kind of thing, or any other interesting phenomenons to do with driver and cyclist etc?
