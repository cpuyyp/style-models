Google has the answer here. I just searched for 'Why do companies incorporate in Delaware" and scanned through the results. One good link is here: The Top 10 Reasons Companies Incorporate in Delaware 

If you can't prioritise these tasks, then let your boss do that. When he gives you yet another job to do, let him know what your current work load is and ask him where this new piece of work goes. Then let him know what tasks then fall off the bottom of the list and get bumped. If he tells you that these news tasks won't impact anything, tell him that it will (and by how much). It might be an idea to keep a track of how long tasks take so that you're able to give him figures. The length of your working day (10 hours is already really long) should be immutable and set in stone. If he questions this, let him know that working longer hours will affect the quality of work. If there's getting to be too much work, consider employing someone else. You may use this as a carrot: 

You have a few options; Get proof, then report him, if it breaks any company policy. In most typical companies this probably would break some form of Code of Conduct (if your company has one). Think of it as if you are in court, the two lawyers could talk a great game to the jury, but it's the evidence that create a guilty verdict or reasonable doubt. Get your ducks in order (evidence) first. Some may think of you whistleblower and that would be the case yes. However if your company does have a CoC handbook, refer to it as most comprehensives CoC's have a whistleblowing section - how to do it properly. Another suggestion could be talking to a HR representative for anonymous advice. As long as you follow things by the book you 'should' be OK. However since you said you have no evidence, then you cannot do anything about that instance. Don't turn into a Columbo and attempt to catch him in the act, concentrate on your own role, but be aware. Thanks @Chad for your thoughts. 

As Jane says in her comment, he's clearly doing himself no favours and doesn't appear to be doing much to contribute to the team's effectiveness. I'd be tempted to privately talk with one or two other team-members and see what the background story of this guy is, and how they cope with his attitude/behaviour. It strikes me that there's signs of a lack of clear leadership from the Dev Lead here if some decisions end up being based on a coin-toss. If there's no clear backstory from what you learn from your team-mates, you might have to suck it up and do the best that you can and keep flagging any blockages to your own work-streams. But take your lead from your team-mates - they've obviously been living with this situation for the past couple of years. 

The blunt truth is that some companies will bend over backwards to make you comfortable and help you get the treatment you need ... and some won't. In many jurisdictions it is illegal to terminate or otherwise discriminate against an employee for medical reasons, but if your issues are chronic and consistent you can apply for "disability" status. This would further protect you in case there is a conflict. As a new employee you're certainly in a more precarious and uncomfortable situation, but I think there is no less protection under the law. Even if you are in a "probationary" period you still cannot be fired for illegal reasons. If you are disabled, your employer must provide "reasonable accommodation". See this site for more information. $URL$ Note also that it may have been illegal to ask about your medical condition when hiring you, so it should not be a factor now ... but all of this is a legal gray area, and of course you're better off having a frank discussion with your employer (without going into too much detail) to allow them to give you reasonable accommodation. For example, perhaps you can finish up work from home on days when you have doctor's appointments? 

It might be an idea to speak with your manager before referring to HR. I feel that it'll be better to make sure that your friend is a good fit for the role being applied for before taking the time to go through the application and HR interviews. 

This is your opportunity to speak about the pros and cons of your other candidate employers and describe what aspects you like and dislike about each one. This highlights the differences between where you're sitting now and the ideal. It's up to you to make this a positive experience in your current interview in letting them know what you like about this company and where you'd like to be. If you choose another company where the pros are radically different from your current interviewer's company, then it's an indicator to them that you might be a bad fit, and you will have talked yourself into rejection. Use this question as a route into negotiation and as a way of letting them know what you like about this company. 

If it was via an agent then it's the agent you have to chase, not the company itself. In the case of an agent then you can follow up with him the moment the interview is over - once you have left the interview premises - with your feedback, which of course encourages communication. The agent is more willing to fight for you when you build a rapport with them. If it was direct with the company, then 5 days is normally a good time to wait until you contact them. NOTE TO SELF FOR FUTURE; At the end your interview with the following questions; Do you have any reservations about me at this stage? When can I expect to hear from you? This closes the loop and creates the expectation that you are not there for fun, but there with a purpose (the job of course!). I've been in several jobs over my career and I can tell you, each time I ask these questions, the employers ALWAYS follow through so it works. Much of what I've said is past tense yes, but hopefully it will help you moving forward, not just with your issue now. 

You're right, he should be making that contact. If he's well enough to contact you, he's well enough to contact the manager. So, just refuse and tell him to self-report, the same as any sane person would do. 

What you call yourself should really depend on who you're talking to and what context they're likely to understand. You can bet that most people outside the industry have no idea what "Lean-Six Sigma" means (I sure don't!). So, bringing this down to "process engineer" describes you in words that people can relate to. You are basically engineering processes to make them more efficient, so it seems a fair fit. It's also ambiguous enough to encourage people to ask more. Here in the UK, you don't need any qualification to call yourself an "engineer" in the computing industry, it's just a description of your role. 

You downloaded but didn't install it? Eh. It's really no big deal. Certainly delete it if it makes you uncomfortable, but until you activate the product I imagine it's like any other trial download of Word. No one cares how many copies of software are downloaded, only the ones that are activated, and for which someone is paying a license fee. While it's certainly a bad idea to use company software on your personal machine for personal use, if you ever, in any way plan to do work from home, you should be fine. If your company has a volume license, just ask your supervisor if it's OK to install it at home as well as on your work computer. Note for reference that a personal edition of Office 365 is only $70/year, if you need something for yourself. Of course, Google Docs is free ... 

Smart employers use other resources such as Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn profiles (especially) to look for any positive comments from other people. LinkedIn has recommendations. This is a big plus, so if you have limited reference resources see what you can do around the social/business social side of things. It helps to establish character - which is what a standard reference would do anyway. A bonus point, employers can only really say that you worked at a place for XXX long. They can't say negative things but only positive. in the UK that is law anyway. 

A couple of suggestions based on the fact that you want to move on; Find out your notice period (if applicable). Agree a fixed day to provide your answer, sooner the better. Reasoning - secure where you are before considering moving on somewhere else. Ultimately there is no reason why you cannot find another contract when in employment, simply have phone interviews, interviews at the end of the day or beginning instead. This is a commonly done thing nowadays and can in fact impress the future employer knowing that you seem to take your commitment to your current role seriously. The sooner you get a new role the sooner you are out of where you don't want to be.
