A number of people have mentioned that you (depending on jurisdiction - not in Scotland for example) need consideration to create a contract. However that neglects the possibility that the NDA is not a contract, but is instead creating or documenting a duty of confidence. If it ever came down to them suing you for breach of confidence, then the fact you had signed an NDA would make it clear that you were aware that the info was confidential. I would ignore the request and say nothing. 

I used to work nine-hour days regularly (and happily), and then my son was born. Suddenly I had to leave at 5:30 to pick him up from nursery. It turned out that the world did not collapse, nobody at my office objected, and there was no negative impact on my job. The first thing I would try, is just saying "I'm not being productive any longer, I'm off." and leaving the office at a reasonable time. It's important to set expectations. Remember the amount of work you get done, is not linear with the number of hours you spend in the office - in fact, for many creative tasks, if you stay too long you are likely to undo good work you did earlier. If there is push back from your manager when you try to work reasonable hours, I would polish my CV and start looking for a better job. When asked, I would say that I was looking for a better work-life balance, and was working 50 hour weeks by my third week. (You need to get that figure in - just saying that you don't like working long hours will be a red flag to employers. Saying that you don't like working 50 hours weeks won't.) 

On your first question: how can I get more time from company A - I would say - Just ask for it. Be honest. Just say you need a little more time to consider your career choices. The effect? If they really like you, they will probably give you a few days - but they have a business to run, so it will not be a long time. If they just consider you to be an "okay" candidate, they will tell you they can't wait, and pressure you to give them an answer or they will just move on to the next person in line. On your second question: what you should do about companies B, C and D - you need to establish a limit date for each one of them - how many days are you able/willing to wait for each one of those companies to get in touch with you? Start from there, then make your decision. It is a good practice to always reach out to a candidate with an answer - either a positive or negative one - but unfortunately it's not all companies that follow good practices, so you may never hear from them again. Be prepared for that. In case you do get a positive answer from one of them - same thing applies as in question #1: if it wasn't your favorite who made you an offer and you want more time to wait for another company, just ask for it. But always bear in mind that when negotiating there is always a risk the other part will not agree and it may jeopardize your chances with them. It all depends on how much you want - or don't want - to work on each of those companies. Also, if I can add an opinion - you already said you don't want to work for company A. Would you be happy there? Would you be committed? Would you be doing your best? If not, why are you still considering it? Maybe the honest thing to do for yourself and for that company is to just withdraw or decline from the process. And they can move on to find someone who is better suited for the job (in terms of actually wanting it). 

The only thing that would make it unethical is if you negotiate with "if you don't give me a pay-rise, I will look for another job". That should be treated as a commitment to stay for at least a year (unless there is a significant change in your circumstances - eg a partner moving to another state). However, if you go in with "I think I've done pretty well over the last year, do you agree I am due a rise?", there isn't a problem. 

I also am not a lawyer (but I have some interest in the law). I do have 35 years experience in the UK workplace. (I refer to "Alice"â€¡ rather than "Person A" below, as I find it easier to read) Don't worry about it. 

I agree with the "you'll be fine" tenor of the other answers here. I want to add one additional suggestion: If you feel that your dress is uncomfortably different from the others and want to change it, one option is go more formal. For example, wear a vest (UK: waistcoat) and bow-tie. For some groups, the point of tee-shirt and jeans is to identify how unconventional they are (compared to "normal business" - the fact that it is very, very, conventional for a small web startup is not the point); wearing ultra-formal clothes is also unconventional and as such, more acceptable than normal business attire. The other point to make is: ask. If this is your first (or early) job, people will be fine about you asking if your clothing is OK. 

It may be appropriate. I certainly don't think it is inappropriate. If it is important to you and you have a compelling reason to do so, go ahead. Personally, if I was the one receiving the letter, I would find that strange. If you are seeking a position in any company (University or any other businesses) you are dropping your personal brand and assuming that company's brand. You are making a proposal to put your skills to their service under their flag, under their brand. I would use that logo if I were to look for a position as a free-lancer professional, or if I were seeking a position in design (in which case it would be a logo I would have designed for myself). The most important thing is: ask yourself what you would think if you were in the position of the recipient of that letter. Ask yourself what is the compelling reason to adding your logo - what is it that you are trying to achieve. If you cannot find an actual (professional) reason for it (that would add more value to your worth for that position), there is your answer. 

If you are faced with a situation where you would need to interview someone you know - either someone you like or someone you dislike, it doesn't really matter - you will have a bias towards that person, either positive or negative. And that alone is unprofessional. If a friend, relative, spouse, ..., of yours is to be considered for a position in your company - would you favor them in detriment of other professionals? That wouldn't be professional... it is okay to refer someone to your company, but you need to disclose that information. And you shouldn't be the one doing an interview. The same applies for someone you dislike for personal reasons. You should disclose the fact that you know them, mention you do have a bias towards them for personal reasons. Should management ask for additional information, please, share the aspects you feel comfortable sharing, but keeping in mind you need to keep the hiring process fair to the candidate, to yourself and to your company - every story has two sides to it, and if you are the only one sharing your point of view - you may influence the hiring process in an unfair way. For fairness and professionalism's sake you should mention to management you wouldn't feel comfortable doing the interview and excuse yourself from the process. Let them assign someone else to the interview if they still want to consider that person. It will be professional and a strong enough message on your ethics. It will at the same time make them pay close attention to everyone in the hiring process to make sure they are a good fit to company culture and won't bring more trouble than benefit for your company, keeping it fair and a healthy workplace for everyone. 

Recently (2 mos. ago) joined a data analysis team at a large U.S. corp. This team is an interesting mix of technical and not very technical people. My boss and I are more on the technical side- can code in various languages, can employ different tools etc. Co-worker A and B are responsible for analysis of specific data and products- while they cannot code, they have knowledge about their subject matter and can utilize a data visualization tool effectively. I respect that we all know different things and are experts in different ways. I always try to get my co-workers' opinions on things they know more than me, like their data sets, their products or the company. The problem is this: I feel like I rub my co-workers the wrong way when I want to be more technical in the way I do things. I get this impression because Co-worker A has told me on more than one occasion that "this team is about X" and "we do things like X". Here's my issue with that- my hiring manager is happy to have me utilize whatever skills I have to my disposal, and this team knew what I was about when it was hiring me. In fact, we talked about how I like to supplement my work with code or want to do "Y" type of analysis to our data during my interviews. Maybe this wasn't conveyed properly. My boss's boss is also happy with the direction I take with tasks- he is excited to see me do things that are new for this team. Because of this he invites me to meetings that either co-worker A or B, or both, may not be invited to. This I think is another sore point for both of them, me being new and all- evident by not responding to my friendly IMs, like hey how are you. I would like to have a good working relationship with both coworkers, but I am unsure how to overcome the "resentment" that may arise because of these issues. I call it resentment for lack of a better word. More context: co-worker A has been at the company for 3 years, has a ton of friends here, and I think doesn't like that I am not truly a subordinate to him (I think I am, I have told him on more than one occasion he's the expert on X and I trust his on judgement on X etc.) He doesn't want to teach or mentor me, but I think is more interested in maintaining his power and status; this is evident by him complaining about me asking too many questions to someone from another team. This co-worker is also quite gossipy and may even tell tall, negative tales (though not sure about this). Problem to solve: how do I survive in this kind of team dynamic?
