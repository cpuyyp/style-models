Not necessarily. For one thing, many cartridge style bottom brackets will have some spindle exposed when the crank is mounted. This is because even though two bottom brackets might both be 68 mm, one may have a longer spindle than the other. If you mount the same crank on both bottom brackets, it might fit flush against the bottom bracket shell on the shorter spindle, but would have a gap on the longer spindle. More importantly, most cranks curve outward from the bottom bracket so that the cranks will clear the chainstays. You can see what I mean in this picture: 

Different people have different proportions. Just because someone is the same height as you doesn't necessarily mean that you'll both ride the same size frame. Different bikes have different geometries. This means that two bikes that are both the same size may fit you differently. 

I'm looking to replace my current drop bars. I like the width just fine and would like to get a new set that is the same width (or at least close to it). How is the width measured? Is it the overall outer width? The width between the center of the bar ends? The width between the inner edges of the bar ends? The width of the flats up until the curve? Something completely different? 

If you can't time it so you don't actually get caught at the light, you pretty much just have to dismount. As Daniel R Hicks mentioned, you can use a curb if one's available, but that's not always the case. And on a personal note, my strong leg is my right leg and since I live in America, the curbs are on the right, which makes that method less appealing to me. If you set your pedals properly, dismounting can actually help you accelerate more quickly when you get going. Set the pedal for your stronger leg a bit less than 45 degrees from vertical. This allows you to get a full stroke right off the bat. When the light turns green, all you have to do is stand up, which puts your full weight on the pedal, and you're off. If you're riding a geared bike, it's also a good idea to shift into the appropriate gear before you actually come to a stop. It takes a bit of practice and familiarity with your bike to know what gear that is, but it comes pretty naturally over time. 

I've personally never seen or heard of a waterproof spray that will protect against soaking. Water hitting the material might run off fairly well, but a continuous rain soaks it so much that water will just seep through. That might not be a problem for commuting, but I'm assuming that if you're going through the extra step of double water-proofing, you're probably touring. If you're touring, you're almost certainly going to be stuck riding in the rain for an extended period of time at some point. Waterproof covers are ok. The problem is that they don't completely cover the pannier since they can't wrap around the mounting hardware. The back of the pannier will get wet. If there's enough rain, it'll get wet enough to soak through to what's inside. Another problem with covers, and this is the part that I like the least about them, is that it's just one more thing that you have to carry around. I'm not necessarily a weight-weenie, but I am a space-weenie and covers take up a fair amount of it. Personally, I'd recommend skipping the dry bags (again, they just take up extra space) and getting fully waterproof roll-top panniers like the ones made by Ortlieb, Axiom, or Vaude. These bags will stand up to a freaking monsoon without any worry of water getting inside. The only real water related problem that you're likely to run into is that humidity can build up and condense inside the bags. But you're not talking about a huge amount of water there, certainly less than you would if you were caught in a downpour with a bag that wasn't waterproof to begin with. 

I have a Trek 520 with a Tubus Tara rack on the front and a Tubus Cargo (not the newer Evo model) rack on the rear. I'm thinking about trading in the 520 for a 29er with disc brakes, probably a Salsa Fargo. So I guess my question is two parts: 

And I'm sure it goes without saying that you'll need some tools and a good book about bicycle maintenance. I think that covers it. You're probably looking at $500 (US) minimum, probably more like $1000. For that price, just buy a new bike that has discs and gears. 

Within those constraints, you'll find that you have a whole lot of options. One of those options is probably the crankset that you're looking at, but you'll have to check all that stuff to be sure. 

I would actually recommend a cyclocross or touring frame. In my experience, skinnier tires cut through snow a bit better and you end up with a tire that's actually touching the pavement instead of riding on top of a layer of snow. With a cyclocross or touring frame, you'll have enough clearance for cyclocross tires with a little bit of lug to them (you don't want regular slicks), fenders, racks, and whatever else you want to do. You can also set it up with either drop bars or risers, just make sure to get the appropriate brake setup for whichever bar you choose. A cyclocross frame would solve your disc brake problem too. Disc brakes are becoming standard on cyclocross bikes. You see them on touring frames too, but not as often. As I understand it, they make it harder to mount racks but I don't have any hands-on experience with that. 

As others have mentioned, there's no problem having different wheels or tires. There are actually some very good reasons to have a larger tire in the back than in the front. Larger tires allow you to run the tire at a lower pressure and gives you a cushier feel. Slimmer tires are lighter, reduce rolling resistance and aerodynamic drag, and give the bike a more nimble feel. Since rear wheel supports more weight, it makes more sense to put a larger tire in the rear. A larger tire. This isn't as much of a concern with the front wheel since it's supporting less weight. Also, your arms absorb an unexpected bump a bit more easily than your butt does. That being the case, you can put a smaller tire up front to make the steering more nimble and reduce weight, rolling resistance, and drag. For all the same reasons mentioned above, it's also relatively common to see rear wheels more stoutly built than their front counterparts. This is most apparent on high-end race bikes, which can have almost twice as many spokes on the rear wheel as they do on the front. The rear wheel spokes are also crossed to give them greater strength while the front are often laced radially without any spokes crossing the others. 

I recently got a new bike with a set of tubeless compatible rims. The stock tires are clinchers with tubes. I'm thinking about putting tubeless on there, but I don't have any experience with them. We have some trees here that drop huge thorns, like nails. They're big enough to go through any tire. When I get the eventual flat, how do I fix the tire? Are there patches? Can you just stick a tube in there? 

Daniel R Hicks's comment is correct: You should be able to go 3mm smaller with no problems. It's likely that you could go significantly smaller than that. Eventually, you hit the possibility that the rims are too narrow for the tire but unless you're running rims that were designed for a 29er, you're not likely to have that problem. It's also not likely that you'll notice much of a difference in ride quality based solely on the size change. Dropping from 35 to 32mm is really such a small difference that any change that you notice will more likely be attributable to changing the brand, model, and tread pattern. 

It's a bit muddy and will probably ultimately be decided by the lawyers, but... According to the John Fahey, the president of WADA: "I am confident and WADA is confident that the USADA acted within the WADA code, and that a court in Texas also decided not to interfere," Fahey said in a telephone interview. "They now have the right to apply a penalty that will be recognized by all WADA code countries around the world." $URL$ And according to the WADA Code, it is the responsibility of international organizations: 20.3.9 To vigorously pursue all potential anti-doping rule violations within its jurisdiction including investigation into whether Athlete Support Personnel or other Persons may have been involved in each case of doping. 20.3.12 To cooperate with relevant national organizations and agencies and other Anti-Doping Organizations. $URL$ So according to WADA, the USADA does have the right to impose penalties and the UCI is bound by the WADA Code to comply with their findings. They can, of course, appeal to The Court of Arbitration for Sport. And they almost certainly will. 

Those don't look that great. Students would need a long cable lock in order to lock their bikes. There's no way that they could do it with a U-lock. And the weight of the bike is resting on the spokes, which is not good for them. Also, I'm not sure what level of school you're talking about, but I imagine an elementary school child might have a hard time lifting their bike that high. Here are some features you should look for: 

Your description sounds like the wheel is out of true, out of round, or some of the spokes are so loose that they're flexing as the wheel rotates. However, for it to be as severe as you describe I would expect it to be visible on spinning the wheel and watching it, even to a novice mechanic. Whatever the case, you should take your bike to a qualified mechanic. The problem may be fixable, possibly as simple as tightening and loosening the appropriate spokes. This is a relatively difficult job for a novice mechanic though. It is also perfectly possible that you need a new wheel. An experienced mechanic would have to visibly inspect the wheel to be sure. If it's a simple fix, it could be as low as $15 US. If you need a new wheel, I would expect it to be around $75-125 for a bike that age depending on what quality you would like to get. I would also recommend checking with a couple mechanics. Some are quick to sell new parts when an older part is serviceable. 

There is most likely a state statute dictating that your license plate must be clearly visible. How exactly they define that will vary from state to state. There is also most likely a statute dictating where your license plate must be placed. I.e., not more or less than a certain distance from the ground. And although I'm not aware of a state that does this, it's not unthinkable that there would be something requiring that the license plate be horizontally centered on the rear of your vehicle. 

I see them advertised as being good for one or the other. Is there really a difference? Or is it just a marketing gimmick? 

You're really asking two questions here: 1) Do road tires lose air more quickly? And 2) Do tubeless tires lose air more quickly? First off, let's talk about the different ways that tires can (and do) lose pressure. Obviously, they can lose pressure through a poor seal, either on the valve or where the tire seats to the rim on tubeless tires. Tires also lose pressure through permeation. This essentially means that air molecules escape between the molecules that make up the casing (i.e., tube or tubeless tire). This is true of all tires, not just bicycle tires. And of course, there is always the possibility of a slow leak caused by a puncture. No matter what the reason for air loss, a tire at a higher pressure will lose air more quickly than a tire at a lower pressure. Thus, if we assume the same type of tire, materials, etc: road tires lose air more quickly than cross tires, and cross tires lose air more quickly than mountain bike tires. Additionally, air loss is also more noticeable on smaller tires because any air that escapes represents a larger percentage of the total volume of air. So, if you have a 26x2 mountain bike tire and a 700x23c and inflate them both to the same pressure, they will initially lose the same amount of air at the same rate. However, since the air lost in the road tire represents a larger percentage of the overall volume, the pressure will drop more quickly. And as the pressure drops, the road tire will lose air more slowly, but the pressure will still drop more quickly than the mountain bike tire due to its significantly greater size. Air loss is also exacerbated by thinner walled casings. This means that (again, assuming the same materials) lighter and thinner tubes will lose air more quickly than heavier and thicker tubes. Now, I don't have a lot of experience with tubeless, but given that caveat... Tubeless tires should in theory lose air less quickly than tubes due to the thickness of the casing and the fact that people typically run them at lower pressures. I have heavily stressed "in theory" here because it is certainly possible that tubeless tires are more permeable than tubes and because of this, some balance is achieved. 

The fender or "mud guard" is so high because if it was much lower the tire would be banging into it whenever the shock compressed. 

There are a couple of reasons. The KISS Principle If anything vital breaks while you're touring and you can't fix it on the spot, you're stranded. You're too far from home to call your mom for a ride. Unless you have a spare for the broken part, your options are some DIY jerry rigging and/or praying that someone with a truck comes by who will carry you and all your stuff to the nearest town. There's less that can go wrong with a rigid fork, so less chance of being stranded. Standard parts are easier to replace and repair Rack-ready suspension forks are irreplaceable, irrepairable abominations. Ok, that's an exaggeration. But it's definitely harder to get a replacement or get it repaired. Head shock? Only one of the three bike shops in my town sells Cannondale stuff. If you end up in a smaller town with one bike shop (or none) you may be out of luck. If you find yourself limping along to some no-name town in the middle of nowhere, your best hope for repairs is to have standard parts. It's true that you can find mounting apparatuses (apparatii?) that will allow a rack to mount to a standard suspension fork but they all require additional parts, violating the KISS Principle. Weight In spite of (or perhaps, because of) the abundance of gear that tourists carry, there are weight-weenie tourists. Suspension forks are heavy. Or at least heavier. Efficiency Another reason is that a suspension absorbs energy, and rationing ones energy is a primary concern of the long-distance tourist. Physics (supposedly) When I first got into touring there was a notion that suspension forks weren't designed to withstand the lateral forces of braking well enough to add weight to the fork. The idea was that the forward force of the bike's weight on the steer tube and the forward weight of the panniers on the lowers would flex the fork and damage it. This seems to have either been overcome or disproven, but old ideas sometimes die hard. This is probably the reason that Giant used such a bizarre contraption on the front of their Expedition AT, to compensate for those forces. Most people just don't need it Most people tour on the road where suspension doesn't really do enough to justify all the other costs. As others have mentioned in the comments, if you're having wrist pains there is most likely a fit/setup issue with your bike. There are any number of possible solutions, all of which would be specific to you and your bike. See your LBS for advice.
