So restrictive. For non-definite noun phrases, it seems to me that the same distinction doesn't apply, at least not in the same way. I can think of two kinds of indefinite noun phrases 

You can usually tell the difference by the amount of stress that the wh-word carries. If it carries stress, it's likely to be interrogative. If not, it's likely to be relative. If this doesn't work, you can try to rephrase. If you can rephrase so the we-word becomes a top level interrogative, it's likely an interrogative in the original clause. If you can rewrite so the wh-word has a head, it's a nominal relative clause 

The justification for the 3 syllables in /hiroo/ is that there is a morpheme boundary between /hiro/ and /o/. However, in my opinion the 2 words are pronounced exactly the same. Assuming that I am correct, what purpose does the concept of syllables serve? I can see that in other languages, it might make sense to distinguish between long vowels and double vowels (e.g. the former might be approx. 1.5 times as long as short vowels, the latter twice as long), but since Japanese is mora-based (i.e. both are twice as long), does the distinction serve any purpose? 

As far as I can see, by this definition, loanwords would also be cognate words. Wikipedia also seems to share this definition, and it explicitly mentions the "cognate doublet" shirt and skirt. $URL$ 

Japanese pronunciation is mora-based (correct me if there is a better word), i.e. each mora is pronounced with equal length. Still I sometimes see the concept of syllables used, e.g. 

This seems like a curious fact, since AFAIK the words are pairwise cognates. Is there a logical explanation? 

German has some postpositions, although they're far less common than the prepositions: $URL$ Another English example I can think of is "the whole night through", and I can think of some in some other Germanic languages too. I know I'm not really answering your "how usual" question, and I don't even know why they (to some extent) co-exist in Germanic. The latter might make an interesting new question. 

1 minute of googling takes me to $URL$ which shows that Dutch has 3 genders, masculine, feminine and neuter, with the masculine and feminine definite article being "de", and the neuter one being "het". 

Language isolates. Ancestors or relatives of existing non-IE languages, e.g. Basque. Descendants of other IE-proto-languages, Proto-Romance, Proto-Slavic etc. (If these branched before Proto-Germanic) Descendants of PIE which aren't descendants of other IE-proto-languages. 

I don't see why a definite article suffix and "definiteness" as a noun property contradict each other. The "definiteness" is achieved by attaching a suffix morpheme to the indefinite version. And just to comment on your comparison between Scandinavian languages and e.g. Albanian, I don't see much difference. I know nothing about Albanian, but from your examples, I would assume that '-a' is the definite article suffix, and 'Tiranë -> Tirana' and 'Shkodër -> Shkodra' are results of vowel elision in the last syllable of the stem. The exact same phonomenon happens in e.g. Danish. 

While both German and Danish have different forms of adjectives in definite and indefinite noun phrases, noun phrases with possessive personal determiners pattern with the indefinite noun phrases in German, 

Danish has two regular ways to form past tense, -ede and -te. Swedish has 3 regular conjugations, -er verbs, -ar verbs and -r verbs. Modern Japanese has two regular conjugations, godankatsuyo (5-row conjugation) and ichidankatsuyo (1-row conjugation). 

Tracing back in time through the language hierarchy, I imagine that geographical areas where ancestors of existing "alive" languages were spoken will narrow in, leaving lots of gaps (Since for instance, PIE wasn't spoken in the whole area where people speak Indo-European now). This makes me wonder how one can speculate about what was in those gaps. Let's for instance take Proto-Germanic. When some people spoke it, what did people speak outside that area, but within the area where people speak Germanic languages now? For, say, North America, I imagine people spoke native American languages that might or might not be ancestors of existing native American languages. For Northwestern Europe, I'm not so sure. I can think of some possibilities: 

Germanic strong-weak verbs. Germanic verbs are usually either strong (vowel change, "ablaut") or weak (suffix), but strong-weak verbs (mostly modal verbs) are both. As far as I know, this takes place in all Germanic languages. English certainly is no exception: can-could, will-would, may-might 

So finally my question: Does the restrictive/non-restrictive distinction make sense for relative clauses modifying all specific indefinite noun phrases? If so, please explain it and provide syntactic or semantic tests that can distinguish, not vague tests like "is the relative clause integral to the sentence?". 

It wasn't completely clear to me from your question whether you were asking for examples that weren't Mandarin or Russian, but at least I thought it would be useful for readers to have examples: Mandarin: 

Just to illustrate that there is not a complete consensus about the definition, this is how David Crystal defines it in A Dictionary of Linguistics and Phonetics 

@jlovegren's answer is complete, just wanted to add some points. Another possible reason for German to be mistaken for SOV is that subordinate clauses usually follow a SOV pattern. 

On the Wikipedia page for the International Phonetic Alphabet, slashes for phonemes are mentioned quite casually, without getting into the discussion of how or if it makes sense to use a phonetic alphabet to transcribe phonemes. I can understand how it makes sense to have an international phonetic alphabet, since all humans have the same speech organs. However, phonemes are a completely different animal. They're an abstraction of one or more phones which are in some sense considered equivalent in a specific language. I would therefore think that such a thing as an international phonemic alphabet wouldn't make sense at all. Although there could be 2 languages having a phoneme that cover the same set of allophones realized in the same way in the same contexts in both languages, that would be due to relatedness or mere coincidence. It wouldn't work in the general case. Even if we simply consider a phoneme just a set of allophones, the characters in a truly international phonemic alphabet would potentially need to contain all subsets of the set of phones. There are exponentially many of these compared to phones. So is using IPA for phonemes completely bona fide? If so please explain how the above shortcomings are handled. Or are the above shortcomings understood, but IPA just used for phonemic transcriptions anyway because it turns out to be convenient? 

As Mark Beadles says in a comment, declinability seems relevant mostly for subordinating conjunctions, since these make the subclause into a POS of main clauses or other subclauses (Not sure if any languages use anything similar to cases to coordinate main clauses). Also, declinability seems mostly relevant for (let me know if there is a better word) nominalizing subordinating conjunctions (English 'that') since other subordinating conjunctions almost always head adverbial phrases. If we stretch the definitions and classify Japanese nominalizers 'koto' (and 'no') as nominalizing conjunctions and also classify (certain) Japanese particles as case markers (although these are usually analyzed as syntactic constructs, not morphological declensions), we could argue that Japanese has declinable conjunctions: 

I'm struggling to understand the restrictive/non-restrictive distinction for relative clauses modifying indefinite noun phrases. The distinction seems very clear for definite noun phrases. It's a question of whether the relative clause is necessary to identify the noun phrase from the discourse/context or not. 

This use of "a TV" is similar to "any TV" or "TVs". In this case, the relative clause seems restrictive in the literal sense of the word. I'm looking for a TV, any TV, but with the restriction that it has to fit into my bathroom. I cannot think of a non-restrictive relative clause that can modify this kind of noun phrase, at least in English. I think one would usually rephrase. 

I.e. I might have seen 100 TVs that day, but this was the only one that fit into my bathroom. But there are also cases where this kind of restriction doesn't apply, e.g. in descriptions of scenery: 

Specific I see that there are still cases where a restriction makes sense, as for non-specific noun phrases, e.g. 

Yes. The more languages you know, the easier it generally is to learn new ones. Whether Sanskrit is particularly useful for learning German, I don't know Sanskrit well enough to judge, but this will probably depend on what other languages you already know. I would guess that if you already know English, that will benefit you a lot more in learning German than knowing Sanskrit will. But I'd still like to point out that I don't think genetic relation is necessarily the best/only indicator for how useful one language is for learning another. Certain aspects of languages can be similar across languages that are only remotely related, or even not at all. For example, the Spanish and Japanese phonologies are much more similar than say, the Spanish and French ones are. That doesn't mean that Japanese is more useful than French for learning Spanish, but if the phonology is a "hole" which would otherwise be hard for you to master, your Japanese knowledge might just fill that hole. Whether there are similar ties between Sanskrit and German, I don't know. My guess is that the page you link to is targeting Indians trying to learn German, so I suspect that is why Sanskrit is taken up as a language that readers might know. I find it quite probable that knowledge about Sanskrit will benefit you in at least some aspects of learning German. However, I do find the examples listed on the page quite random and anecdotal in nature.
