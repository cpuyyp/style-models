In essence, he had the trust of General Marshall in the United States, and also of Winston Churchill and the senior Britsh military staff. He had the political skills that he had acquired while working for MacArthur in Washington, and a clear understanding of the strategy that should be pursued (after all, he had drafted it!). He was the logical choice for Supreme Allied Commander Europe when the need for that role was recognised. 

The British Mulberry Harbour, Mulberry B (a.k.a "Port Churchill") at Arromanches-les-Bains continued to operate until 19 November 1944. This operated in addition to the figures mentioned in the US Report above, and achieved a daily discharge rate of up to 12,000 tons (corresponding to a monthly rate of about 350,000 tons) over that period. This was broadly comparable with the figures achieved by the harbour at Omaha Beach. On a side note, there is an interesting review of the design, construction and deployment of the Mulberry Harbours in The Mulberry Harbours by Sir Bruce G. White who had been a part of the team involved in their planning and design. 

In most cases, you would almost certainly need to visit the archives in person, or employ someone to visit on your behalf, to access these records. 

In the aftermath of Pearl Harbor, Robert Watson-Watt was called in to give an assessment of what went wrong. His report was damning. He identified: 

President Wilson revealed the existence of the telegram to the press on 28 February 1917. The press published the story the next day 1 March 1917 (and remember that Berlin is 6 hours ahead of Washington time). The German embassy in Washington would have had to send a telegram to Germany to inform them that the contents of what we now call "The Zimmermann Telegram" had been made public. At that point, Germany had little choice but to respond, and to respond quickly. Denial was never an option, since the cipher-text was still held in the telegraph company files in the United States and could be checked. The United States ambassador, Walter Hines Page, had these details (presumably from the head of Room 40, William Reginald Hall) and had included them with his report to President Wilson. By claiming that his instructions (to the Mexican government) 

In the case of the earliest tablets discovered at Vindolanda, I understand that the preservation was due to pockets of anaerobic (oxygen-free) conditions which had been created by layers of compacted clay between successive floor layers and the great depth of material above those layers (up to 6m in the case of the first discoveries) (this point is made on page 17 of The Roman Writing Tablets from Vindolanda by Alan K. Bowman). Preservation would also have been enhanced by the tannins produced by the organic remains and from the leather items that were also found in those layers. However, you are mistaken about the oxidisation of metal artefacts. Even iron artefacts (like stylii for writing on wax tablets) in these layers were very well preserved. You can find details of the small finds recovered from these deep layers in the research report on small finds. Having said that, tablets have also been recovered from later (and therefore shallower) layers at Vindolanda. In the case of these tablets, the mechanisms that created the (presumably) local anaerobic conditions that allowed preservation of the tablets, and the writing on them, do not appear to be fully understood and iron artefacts from these layers often do exhibit more oxidisation than those from the deeper layers. (The recently discovered batch tablets that have been in the news over the last week were again recovered from anaerobic conditions in the deepest part of the site.) The discovery and conservation of the tablets is discussed at some length in Vindolanda Research Reports, New Series, Volume II. The report on the conservation of the original tablets is The conservation of the wooden writing tablets from Vindolanda Roman Fort, Northumberland by S.M. Blackshaw. It was published in Studies in Conservation, volume 19. I haven't been able to locate a (free) readable / downloadable version online though, and it is many years since I read it. Even when the ink is oxidised, and no longer visible to the naked eye, it can still be observed and photographed under infra-red light. Vindolanda isn't the only site where tablets with ink writing have been recovered. The conservation of similar tablets from Carlisle back in 1981 is discussed in this paper. However, although it gives a fairly good description of the conservation techniques employed, it still doesn't address the underlying chemistry that causes the ink to oxidise and fade. It's worth mentioning that the content of the tablets is available online on two sites: Vindolanda Tablets Online which has details of tablets 118-573 from The Vindolanda Writing Tablets volume I and II, and some useful background resources. (This is the site you quoted from in the question) and Vindolanda Tablets Online II which has tablets 574-853 from The Vindolanda Writing Tablets volume III in addition to tablets 118-573 from volume I and II. This also has some useful indices and other resources. However, neither site has any real detail on the conservation techniques used on the tablets, or about the chemical reactions that cause the ink on excavated tablets to fade. 

I do know that some of the earlier oaths survive. The earliest is the oath composed by Archbishop Dunstan for the coronation of Edgar 973 AD: 

Without getting too involved in a discussion of terminal ballistics, the Napoleonic period armour certainly offered some protection against firearms, but it was only effective up to a point. This picture shows a a French cavalry cuirass (a breastplate worn as body armour) from Waterloo on display in the Musée de l’Armée: 

It was Hugh the Abbot who became the regent and guardian for Robert's sons, Odo and Robert, after Robert the Strong was killed at the Battle of Brissarthe in 866. Robert the Strong had been defending Francia against a joint Breton-Viking raiding party. At some point during the battle, he had removed his armour. At that point, the Vikings launched a surprise attack and Robert was killed in the course of the resulting melee. As an adult, Odo (or Eudes) would become King of Francia from 888 to 898. 

There are real challenges involved in identifying the organic residues that suggest the processing of alcoholic beverages. As you observed, fermentation is a natural process and would be expected to occur in a number of vessels at random. So how do we know that the alcohol was deliberately produced? The short answer is consistency. For example, chemical signatures consistent with honey, and organic compounds associated with fermentation are routinely found in beaker vessels - it could still be there by chance, but the frequency with which it has been found suggests that the probability of it being intentional is high. Some of the evidence for the early production of beer in Britain and Northern Europe is currently less compelling, but the analysis techniques used for residue analysis are improving all the time. 

To the best of my knowledge, only one thimble has been found in a securely-dated context earlier than the sixth century (at Ephesus). That example is thought to be an import from China. One of the oldest known examples was found in 2010, in a context that has been securely dated to the seventh century, in excavations at Punta Secca in Sicily. However, so far we have less than a dozen thimbles that can be securely dated to the period from the sixth to the ninth centuries so there is no real evidence for the extensive use of thimbles up to that date. The use of thimbles appears to become more widespread in the Eastern Mediterranean from about the ninth century onward.
