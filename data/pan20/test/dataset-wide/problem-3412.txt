You might be overthinking this. To make things clearer, try the following substitution. Let $$y=\ln\frac{q(\omega)}{q(\omega^\prime)}$$ and $$x=\ln\frac{p(\omega)}{p(\omega^\prime)}$$ The first equation you show then becomes $y=-\sigma x $, and all you're looking for is $\frac{\partial y}{\partial x }$. 

In standard proofs of the existence of Walrasian equilibrium, after one applies the appropriate fixed point theorem (typically Kakutani's, but sometimes Brouwer's), one then shows that the given fixed point is, in fact, a Walrasian equilibrium. Depending on the exact construction of the proof, sometimes the fixed point will only give you the equilibrium price vector. However, this will be done so that the implied demands will then clear the market. In other proofs, like this one, the fixed point will give you both the equilibrium price and allocation. 

As noted in the comments, it is not true that homothetic preferences must have constant marginal rates of substitution. To see this, recall that preferences given by the utility function $$ u(x,y) = x^\alpha y^{1-\alpha} $$ are homothetic. (More generally, Cobb-Douglas preferences are homothetic.) However, the marginal rate of substitution is $$ \text{MRS}(x,y) = \frac{\alpha}{1-\alpha}\frac{y}{x}, $$ which is not constant. However, the MRS is homogeneous of degree zero, since $$ \text{MRS}(\lambda x, \lambda y) = \text{MRS}(x,y). $$ Homogeneity of degree zero of the MRS is a general property of homothetic preferences. This follows from the fact that (continuous) homothetic preferences have a utility representation that is homogeneous of degree one. Conversely, when the MRS is homogeneous of degree zero, preferences are homothetic. Hence, preferences that exhibit constant MRS are also homothetic. The proof is a little involved. For this, I refer to you lemma $1$ of "Duality and the Structure of Utility Functions" by Lau (1970). (Note that Lau states a different definition of homotheticity than you do. However, the Lau's definition and yours are equivalent when preferences are continuous -- which they must be for the MRS to be well-defined.) 

Another interesting fact worth mentioning is that, while Krugman’s advisor, Dornbusch, did not win the Nobel, Dornbusch’s supervisor, Mundell, did. A similar comment applies so Lovell, who was Leontief's student, and had two students who won the Prize. More interesting observations: predictably, for the vast majority of these pairs, the advisor won the prize before the student. Exceptions are Leontief and Samuelson; Fama and Scholes; and Hurwicz and McFadden. Other triplets: 

Eric Maskin has a paper called “Friedrich von Hayek and Mechanism Design”, which tries to connect some of Hayek’s ideas to the (formal) theory of mechanism design. This paper, and the references therein, might interest you. 

This may not be exactly what you're looking for, but your question reminds me of the work of Elinor Ostrom, who (along with Oliver Williamson) won the Nobel in Economics for her work on what academics in the field call 'the commons'. Here's a good place to start reading about her work. Check under 'Popular Information' and 'Advanced Information' in particular for details about her work. 

Consider a pure exchange economy with $N\geq2$ consumers, each of whom has locally non-satiated preferences. We know from the First Welfare Theorem that any Walrasian equilibrium is Pareto-efficient. We index consumers by superscripts. Say that consumer $i$ envies consumer $j$'s allocation if $i$ strictly prefers $j$'s allocation to their own: $$ x^j \succ^i x^i $$ If these preferences have a utility representation, then this is equivalent to $$ u^i (x^j) > u^i(x^i) $$ It is an easy consequence of the First Welfare Theorem that in any Walrasian equilibrium, no two agents, regardless of income, envy each other's allocations. If they did, this would violate Pareto-efficiency. Notice, however, that this is not the same as the allocation being envy-free. 

This is answered by proposition 1.12 in Kreps, Microeconomic Foundations I. I believe the result is originally due to Debreu. Here is the (verbatim) statement: 

The first equality, as you've already found, equates $A$'s and $B$'s MRSs. The last equality comes from setting the marginal rate of transformation $MRT_{XY}$ between $X$ and $Y$ to the common MRS. For a production function with a single input and a single output, $MRT_{XY}$ is equal to $MP_X$, the marginal product of the input good $X$. That is: $$ MRT_{XY} = \frac{1}{2}\sqrt\frac{5}{X}. $$ For details, see Mas-Colell, Whinston and Green (1995), section 16.F. 

The mathematical theory behind DSGE models can be found in any textbook on stochastic dynamic optimisation. One common reference that economists use for this is Stokey, Lucas and Prescott. Of course, they focus exclusively on recursive methods, but (perhaps) the lion’s share of dynamic problems in economics are solved in this way. There is also a treatment of dynamic optimisation (including non-recursive and/or continuous-time methods) in Acemoglu. 

Here's a quotation from a paper on Partial Differential Equations in Macroeconomics. One of the authors is a Fields Medalist. 

Yes. Suppose the consumer has the following utility function: $$u(x) = - \sum_{i=1}^n x_i$$ Here's a different example, where commodities are goods instead of bads: $$v(x,y) = -(x-a)^2 - (y-b)^2$$ When the consumer's budget $m$ is strictly greater than $p_x a + p_y b$, then the consumer will not consume all of their budget. 

Honourable mentions, who I classify as economists who have at least two students who have won the Nobel include: 

Monir is correct to point out in the comments that $\ln$ is not a linear transformation. It is an increasing transformation, however, and so should not matter as long as $$ \sum_{i=1}^n p_i \gamma_i < I$$ In any case, your mistake is in the derivatives you find. Here are the correct expressions: $$\frac{\partial W}{\partial p_i} = -\gamma_i \sum_{j=1}^n \frac{\beta_j}{I - \sum_{k=1}^n p_k \gamma_k} - \frac{\beta_i}{p_i} = -\frac{\gamma_i}{I - \sum_{j=1}^n p_j \gamma_j} - \frac{\beta_i}{p_i} $$ $$ \frac{\partial W}{\partial I} = \sum_{j=1}^n \frac{\beta_j}{I - \sum_{k=1}^n p_k \gamma_k} = \frac{1}{I - \sum_{j=1}^n p_j \gamma_j} $$ Roy's identity then gives you the Marshallian demand you've initially, and correctly, derived. 

This does sound a lot like the “contradiction” that Keen tries to derive. The key to resolving it is to remember that firms are small relative to the market, so $$\frac{\mathrm dQ}{\mathrm dq_i} = 0.$$ One way to justify the above restriction is to assume there is a continuum of firms, so that each firm has zero measure, and $$Q = \int_{j \in I} q_j \, \mathrm dj,$$ where $I$ is the index set of firms. Another way to justify the price-taking assumption (which means that price is equal to marginal cost) is to look at a Cournot competition model with a large number of firms, as Michael mentions in his answer to this question. Formally, suppose there are $n$ firms in the industry so that industry output is given by $$ Q^s = \sum_{i=1}^n q_i, $$ where $q_i$ is the output of firm $i$. Market demand is given by the inverse demand curve $$ p = a -bQ, $$ where $a,b > 0$. We normalise each firm's (constant) marginal cost to $0$, so that firm $i$'s profits are given by $$ pq_i=(a-bQ^s)q_i = aq_i - bq_i \sum_{j=1}^n q_j.$$ The choice of $q_i$ that maximises the above expression solves $$ a - b \sum_{j=1}^n q_j -b q_i = 0. $$ In other words, $$ q_i^* (q_{-i}) = \frac{a - b\sum_{j \neq i}q_j}{2b} .$$ In a symmetric equilibrium, $q_i^* = q_j^* = q^*$, so the above best response function gives us $$ q^* = \frac{a - (n-1)bq^*}{2b} \implies q^* = \frac{1}{n+1} \frac{a}{b}. $$ Hence, the equilibrium price is $$ p^* = a - b \frac{n}{n+1}\frac{a}{b} = \frac{1}{n+1}a. $$ It is now easy to show that $p^* \to 0$ as $n \to \infty$, which is exactly the claim that the equilibrium price approaches marginal cost when the number of firms is large.
