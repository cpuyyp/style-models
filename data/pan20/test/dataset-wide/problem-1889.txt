Your best bet here is to negotiate with the company that made you the offer. Tell them that you really hate giving up seven days of vacation, and ask if they could increase your vacation time in your first year. This is a negotiation, and they have no obligation to do it, but you do actually have leverage with them, where you have none with your current company. If they decline, you could ask if it would be acceptable to push back your start date a few weeks or a month to give you a chance to take some of your days off before giving notice. But asking for the company to do other than their policy with unused vacation days is a non-starter, and makes you look either greedy or naive. Try to leave well. 

My preferred way would be to tell my boss first, then privately tell those people that I work most closely with, allowing a chance to explain some of the reasons for my choice. After those that would be most effected by the decision already know (maybe 1/4 to 1/3 of the team) I would mention it in a daily stand-up meeting. I would speak positively about how I will help in the transition, and make sure to express gratitude for the opportunity to work with the current team. And be brief. The reason I prefer to leak the information slowly is to take away the emotional impact of a "big reveal." 

Assuming these are all legitimate mistakes that are the fault of the employees and not the process, a system of peer accountability seems be in order. If you have a regular meeting with the employees to review tickets (e.g. projecting them on the whiteboard), and point out if they have not been updated in a regular enough time. If you have regular stand-up meetings, where the root cause of a problem repeatedly comes down to a certain developer forgetting a semicolon, that should be embarrassing to the programmer and provide the incentive him to change. I don't like meetings anymore than anyone else, but making the team members accountable to each other for results and their performance in following through with certain things will in most cases make them more likely to do it. 

Disclaimer: I am the type of person who will take public transportation even when told explicitly that taking a cab is acceptable because I tend to be frugal and sort of enjoy the sense of adventure. This is probably not the norm. From my perspective, this is what I would conclude from each of the items, if I got word a candidate had submitted those expenses: 

The offer you received was the first step in a negotiation. You can respond by saying you expected the advertised amount, and you can see where the negotiations go from there. Legal rights are almost irrelevant here, because you would almost never want to begin employment by taking your employer to court. 

This man is your colleague, he is not your friend, and he is not your brother. While it is natural and often healthy for colleagues that work closely together to discuss non-work issues, you are never required to engage with him on that level. Since your colleague has taken advantage of your willingness to act as a friend, you need to stop being a friend. You should adopt an all-business persona when working with him. If he starts with a gloomy monologue, cut him off politely with "I'm sorry, but we really need to make progress with the X project." If he takes a break for his leering at a passerby, say, "If you aren't able to focus on our work here, perhaps we should move this meeting to a conference room." In short, minimize personal contact with him, while clearly communicating that you expect professionalism from him. 

See above, and my disclaimer -- I have never ordered room service in my life, regardless of who's paying, since I am viscerally offended at the idea of paying $18 for scrambled eggs. But this may not be the norm. -- I'd say the biggest variable is how your actual interview went. If you did well, then people probably won't be looking for reasons to knock you down. If you did poorly or fair, then submitting questionable expenses could make you the butt of water cooler jokes at the company for the next several years. Remember that guy who couldn't even code fizzbuzz, then expected us to pay for his room service and airport lounge and a replacement for the bus ticket he lost? 

I would say that piece of wisdom applies more to typical IT shops than to software companies. The typical situation is an IT shop at a company that makes widgets, and has some software that is a "cost center." They want to have a base of employees who can support their systems, and aren't terribly likely to move any time soon. Occasionally, they will have projects where they will need to ramp up their staff or acquire a specific skill set. Or they may like to have a "buffer" if they need to cut expenses fast without risking the hassle of laying off employees. In this case, the typical contractor will be making more than the typical employee. The trade-off is for stability. If there are budget cuts, the contractor will likely go before the employee. On the other side, the employees' skills are likely more localized and domain-specific than the contractors', so they may not have as much leverage to negotiate raises, etc. Again, there are exceptions, but I think this is a rough picture at your typical IT shop. -- For companies, that make software as their main business, the model is a little different. They want talent, and are probably willing to pay for it, and may not be as concerned as an IT shop about costs, so they're working off a different model. 

It sounds like much of your unhappiness is with the client company. You could ask for a different assignment, but don't hold your breath. I've tried to obtain a different assignment while in your position, but your employer won't want to put you in a different position without being able to simultaneously back-filling your spot with your current client. Your situation is actually far better than when you took this job. Currently: 

My answer would be that this candidate did not only demonstrate arrogance, but also a lack of understanding of the difference between the things that he knows and the things that he does not know. Such a lack of understanding is crippling when trying to solve difficult technical problems. Since it appears that you role in the interview process was more on the technical side, you should focus on the technical failures. Evidently (and unfortunately) your input on the personal characteristics of the candidate are not being considered. 

You can ask, but it is a long-shot. If they have a standard performance bonus, you would have received it. If they do not have a system of giving bonuses, you can be sure they aren't going to start it for one employee. If they have met your salary requirements, your best bet for further negotiations is to ask for more PTO, particularly if your compensation package has less (or not more) vacation than your previous job. Ultimately, though, there is no non-aggressive way to say: "Thanks for offering the money that I asked for, and said that I would be satisfied with. I'm ready to take the job if you just offer more money." 

The main purpose is to avoid wasting both the candidate's and the company's time if the candidate would not accept an offer at a certain level. If the position is for 60k, and the candidate's lifestyle demands 80k, it's better to know that up front than to go through the whole interview process only to find this out in the end. It's a pre-filter. EDIT: Of course, that's the good, or benign reasons they might ask you that question. The bad, or malevolent reason would be to get you to commit to a lower salary than they are willing to pay. 

Write kick-ass code. If you do an awesome job coding, then there will be fewer fires to put out, and it will make everybody's life easier. When it does, you may need to do a bit of self-promotion in demonstrating how what you did helped. Metrics may be your friend here. If you still encounter resentment even after you have demonstrated how your work is making their jobs easier, then you're probably in a toxic environment and have another set of issues.
