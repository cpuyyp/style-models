The wording provides a contrast with the Hayashi track phase that immediately precedes it, where the luminosity decreases by orders of magnitude with little change in effective temperature. You are correct though, the Henyey track for low-mass stars is not horizontal in the HR diagram, however it is a critical point that the luminosity does not change very much (less than a factor of 3) as the effective temperature increases, since it implies that the star slowly shrinks, and by the virial theorem, the core temperature gradually rises and is ultimately able to sustain nuclear fusion. 

If the planet orbits in the same plane and in the same direction as the stellar rotation (as the planets in our solar system nearly do), then the blue shifted limb of the parent star is obscured first, followed by an equal amount of redshift as the planets moves to obscure the receding stellar limb (see image above, left). Thus the stellar absorption lines show a redshift followed by a symmetric blueshift. If the planet was retrograde it would be symmetric but occur in the opposite order. A Polar orbit would show no RM effect. Inclined orbits would have an asymmetric RM effect - ie perhaps more blueshift than redshift (see image above, right). The RM effect cannot give an exact orientation, it gives the projected angle between orbital and rotation axes on the plane of the sky. Nevertheless, that is sufficient for us to know that a lot of the transiting exoplanets have highly misaligned orbital and stellar rotation axes. 

The boundedness or otherwise of clusters remains to be established in most cases. The vast majority of clusters become unbound and disperse at a much younger age than the Pleiades. Or they may be born unbound as you suggest. The stars in a cluster have a distribution of velocities and there will always be a tail of high speed stars that will be able to escape the gravitational potential in an "evaporation process", even in a cluster which is globally bound (i.e. the sum of kinetic and gravitational potential energies is negative). It turns out that this isn't usually sufficient to explain the disappearance of clusters. A more effective disruptive mechanism are the Galactic tides. Stars that stray beyond a tidal radius can be stripped from the cluster. The reduction in the cluster's mass then reduces the tidal radius allowing more stars to escape in what eventually would become a runaway process. The tidal radius for a cluster near the Sun is about $5 M^{1/3}$ light years, where $M$ is the cluster mass expressed in units of the solar mass. For the Pleiades, $M \sim 1000 M_{\odot}$, so stars that stray beyond 50 light years can be lost. In some cases, the evaporation process causes a cluster core collapse. The escaping stars take away kinetic energy and the remaining stars become more tightly bound. This is what has happened in most of the massive and long-lived globular clusters. Less massive open clusters like the Pleiades are much more susceptible to tidal dissipation. 

The currently accepted answer is not relevant for finding the distance to a star like Proxima Centauri. Here's how parallax works. You measure the position of a star in a field of stars that are (presumably) much further way. You do this twice, separated by 6 months. You then calculate the angle that the star has moved against its background stars. This angle forms part of a large triangle, with a base that is equal to the diameter of the Earth's orbit around the Sun. Trigonometry then tells you what the distance is as a multiple of the distance from the Earth to the Sun. [In practice you perform many measurements with any separation in time and combine them all.] The "parallax angle" is actually half this angular displacement, and a star is said to be 1 parsec away if the parallax angle is 1 second of arc. So 1pc is 1 AU/$\tan (\theta) = 3.08\times10^{16}$ m. The larger the parallax, the closer the star. The Gaia satellite is currently mapping the entire sky and will estimate tiny parallaxes with precisions of $10^{-5}$ to $10^{-4}$ arcseconds (depending on target brightness) for about a billion stars.

Here is a plot I generated in 5 minutes at the site exoplanets.org To construct this I took planets discovered by the transit method and which had a $M \sin i$ measured using radial velocities. I divided the $M \sin i$ by the sine of the measured inclination angle (this is required to avoid using masses that have been estimated using an assumed mass-radius relation). The y-axis is density, which comes directly (and quite precisely) from transit measurements. Of course transiting planets are the only ones with radii and density measurements. You have to do this to avoid some very uncertain values that are given for planetary masses that have been simply assumed from a theoretical mass-radius relationship. As you can see, there is a wide spread (factor of three) in density at a given mass for hot Jupiter's (most of the transiting giant planets are hot Jupiters), but there is a strong correlation. The density is at a minimum for a few tenths of Jupiter mass, but then smaller planets (presumably rocky and icy, rather than gas giants) appear to show higher densities. Remember, these are all transiting exoplanets, and therefore predominantly orbiting close to their parent stars. There could be biases and selection effects at work! For example although the cores of gas giants are governed by degeneracy pressure and this makes the theoretical mass-radius relationship quite flat, there is the perturbing effect of radiation from the parent star ("insolation") that can make some objects larger. Even beyond this there appears to be scatter that is difficult to understand. 

Galaxies are gradually being extinguished. Most star formation activity occurs near the start of a galaxy's life, or in response to merger activity with other galaxies. The star formation rate of the universe peaked at redshifts of around 3, corresponding to a look-back time of around 9 billion years. Since then the star formation rate has declined as the universe expands; mergers are less frequent, gas is driven out of galaxies by supernovae and active galactic nuclei. However, most of the stars that have been formed are of lower mass (K- and M-dwarfs) than the Sun and will live on for tens or hundreds of billions of years. They are however much fainter than the Sun. So although high-mass, luminous O- and B stars live their short lives and are not replaced at the same rate, the low-mass stars continue to shine. This means that galaxies will get fainter on average as the remaining stellar populations increase in average age and decrease in average mass. It is a slow process though. High mass stars are still being formed in our galaxy after 12 billion years, and most spiral galaxies have ongoing star formation. However, star formation has more-or-less ceased in gas-poor elliptical galaxies. 

The short answer is no. We don't even think the census of stars within 30pc is complete, let along have all the other information you want. For all bright stars (say V<10) and close, there are decent parallaxes and proper motions in the Hipparcos and Tycho catalogues, so you can compile tangential velocities for these. A lot of these will also have radial velocities, but there is no recent uniform catalogue of these. Things like the General catalogues of radial velocities are getting a bit old. The Hipparcos input catalogue might be a reasonable source. Magnetic fields have been measured on relatively few stars and usually those which are much younger and more active than the Sun. There is no way of directly measuring stellar ages. This is one of the big problems in astronomy. Estimates can be made for stars in the field but they are rarely more precise than 20-30% and their accuracy, especially for older stars is open to question. I know of no uniform compilation that would help. If you were to restrict your sample to even closer to the Earth, then you might find that the RECONS database for stars closer than 10pc might be of use.
