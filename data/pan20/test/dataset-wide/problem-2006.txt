I've applied for positions and not received responses for months. Most recently I received a text from a company I applied to more than a year ago. It is a side job kind of deal, so something I wasn't going to actively pursue. You can play the patience game or actively find a way to contact the appropriate person with the organization. Use manta or LinkedIn to find a working phone number. Be persistent yet polite. If you really want it, go get it. Don't think someone will be beating down your door to hire you. There are hundreds, if not thousands, of people applying for the same job every single day. Good luck! You might receive more specific suggestions if you let us know what kind of job this is. Specific job classifications have "typical" personality types expected to apply. I'm in sales so if I'm not aggressive when applying for a job I'm not showing my potential employer my skills in that area. 

The OP's concern suggests the first, or a middle case which is between these extreme bounds. In fact, any company in the second edge case is a suicide customer if they can't replace their supplier easily, and surely won't do any damage to Acme. Actually trying to bull someone bigger than you only result in additional damage to yourself. So I assume that the customer has a lot of economical power over Acme. Acme, which to remind is Bob's employer, has very few options in this case. This specific case should be escalated to the top as soon as possible keeping in mind that we are talking about an individual's own future and his right to freedom of thought. Top management must act to define a company policy valid for the future and applied since this very first case. Firing the employee will likely result in legal consequences, and there is the risk that people supporting Bob's ideas will spread the word about Acme being discriminatory, adding reputation consequences over the existing. This is especially true if Acme works in the B2C market and risks more reputational damage than B2B companies. Standing on Bob's side Defending Bob's right of speech is a civil duty, but while may or may not increase Acme's reputation, it will surely cause an economic damage and a stress for the workforce. Bob risks to be "marked" by coworkers as who caused a big customer loss. Unfortunately, this is a lesson to learn for everyone. Market out there is aggressive, sometimes criminal. Who thinks that only mafias come with a knife to the neck of an enterpreneur is wrong. Political affairs are everywhere. Evil customers and suppliers seeking the worst excuse to act power on their counterparts are behind the corner. There is no simple answer. I gave an answer but don't claim the accepted answer flag, because there is none. All answers in this thread are objectionable, including both the downvoted answer that suggests to let Bob go (by Mehrdad) or the one to support Bob and confront Initech (by Ed Heal). I also wanted to highlight that social media policies are widely used by companies but have a different scope. They normally affect the ability for an employee to present himself/herself as an employee of Acme by either prohibiting such advertising or by requiring that any statement must be approved by the company first. Normally bloggers would use a disclaimer like "The opinions and information provided in this site are not to be intended as the official opinion of the Compant nor they are approved/reviewed by it". Edit It is unclear whether Initech simply wants not to deal with Bob (e.g. as sales representative, consultant) or really want Bob to be let go. The second smells really unbelievable to my eyes, as I never seen even the most ultra-Catholic company based in Vatican City complain for a supplier representative that is either homosexual or in a de-facto family (namely has children without getting married). Normally these companies will only request to replace their representative, in which case it could be a deal to move Bob to another customer by explaining the situation and letting him post any licit content on social media. In this case: 

Hand written thank you notes will get you bonus points. Don't go too cutesy. Be professional and mention specifics from the interview. Address it to the person you interviewed with, not HR. 

My work used to be the same. We had a toxic director and gossip, banding together, and the like were some of the few ways we survived her idiocity. It was also one of the ways we caught her lies, which lead to her ultimate downfall. Since her departure things have settled down, though we still have a few pot stirrers in our mix. I've taken it upon myself to give gentle nudges to more positive chatter when the rants and gossiping begin. Instead of "yeah, he was completely out of line and a real jerk for saying that" (even if I agree) I remind the person trying to vilify another that we are all human and can only improve if we're told we made a mistake. We all have disagreements and misunderstandings. How we take action on the frustrations we feel towards others involved really make a difference in how our coworkers and managers see us. I had to mediate between my boss and my coworker (who is now my employee). They had a few disagreements where each had a completely different take on what happened. One thought they deserved an apology because they were having family issues and the other person should have taken that into consideration before saying what they said. (I know, vague, but roll with me a little on this) Instead of saying this directly, they went to every member on our team and complained about the other person. The other person thought there wasn't an issue at all and was shocked to find out how the other person felt about the situation. They were confused why the first person didn't talk to them. I reminded both that we have other things going on in our lives and that they were both reasonable people who shouldn't be afraid to talk to each other. It took a few days but they finally talked and sorted thing out. If you want a better work environment, help create it. Redirect to the positive when a coworker pulls out a dagger. Remind yourself that it will take time and it will be worth it. 

I work in a software company. I am one of the senior-most developers with good knowledge of DevOps practices. For example, not intended to show my pride, I was the one who twice convinced the boss to switch from CVS to SVN to Git. Often I get interrupted by coworkers about technical problems they cannot solve. I understand that in a transitional phase some recurring problems may occur and it is a friendly idea to help other coworkers. However this led to other developers being lazy and treating me like the help desk. I often (this happens since years) get interrupted by people, or get mails, asking for the solution to a very specific technical problem for which the offender did not show any research. I mean he/she got struck in a Git error (to make an example) and instead of Googling he/she directly reported to me, CCing senior staff members who likely do not know the answer. Sometimes, in order to encourage Googling and Stackoverflowing, I called those people to my desk, opened my browser and started a search with them. I wanted to show I am no magic well, no guru, no professor. It is true that in the past I fixed a lot of problems in a few seconds time thanks to having experienced them myself People today still call me for silly problems that a simple Google/Stackoverflow search may solve. In a period I was busy with my own tasks I tried to become unfriendly, answering "I have my stuff to do", "The help desk is open only 30 minutes a day". This resulted in panic and few chats with executive staff (who became aware that staffing me to the help desk could drain my time over the project, jeopardy deadlines, etc.). Today I have got another mail with Cc some senior members who are too busy with their own activities. Note: I interpret ing instead of addressing the mail as an attempt of escalation ("Hey, team leader, I can't proceed until /usr/local/ΕΨΗΕΛΩΝ fixes my problem"). I politely answered "Have you looked or asked on Stackoverflow? I would have done the same". Note 2: we are not motherlanguage English speakers, but there is quite a decent level of English here at least in written form. Question: what kind of attitude or social exercise should I adopt in order to encourage people to first try to solve problems on their own, and then ask other members for advice? And to keep friendly with them. If the staff member proved me to have done some research, instead of vomiting a screenshot on her client, I would have been happier to lift my shiny metal bu** [nsfw] from my chair and go to help. 

I'm not a coder, but I'm a sales person (I've heard "no" more times than you ever will) and I'm also a supervisor (I'm tasked with motivating others), so I will give you my advice on general ways to improve your next review and keeping motivated. First, both you and your boss identified an area that needs improvement. So, do your best to improve and learn. Can you take courses? Make a conscious effort to fix just one of the mistakes or errors you do on a consistent basis and soon you will stop making that mistake. Repeat as needed. Second, while time is of the essence it typically takes less time (in any task) to do it correctly the first time than it does to fo back to correct mistakes. Do it right the first time and you may just find that you have more time to complete future tasks. Motivation can, and should, be internal in addition to external factors. What drove you to this line of work? What inspires you to stick with it? Keep those things in mind. As for your self doubt, remember that this company hired you and keeps you for a reason. If you continue to improve yourself, without being asked, they will have little reason to sever the relationship. 

The boss thinks, without evidence, that diverse people are underqualified. This is the most outrageous possibility. The boss found, after interviewing plenties of diverse candidates (law of huge numbers), that those people were less qualified on an average. Being more "non-diverse" people than "diverse" in the market of candidates, and maybe also due to geo-societary factors, that could be true. It is a fact, dictated by numbers, that people of "different" race have minor probability of having achieved university or post-university grade. So that means that if you want to hire a hispanic, for example, he/she has more difficulties to compete with a white. It's a matter of numbers. 

In the middle there are people who failed a couple of classes, people who worked during academic time, people who were sick, in need to assist sick relatives, or carrying a handicap affecting the ability to complete classes in time. From what I can see in the question, and excluding people who complete in less than the expected years, I find nothing that could raise a red flag on your resume. It can be an opportunity for your to train your self-selling skills not to "justify why you took so long" but rather to focus the attention on what really matters, e.g. on your actual skills, non-academic work, etc. Really, if a couple of more years did matter, a lot of people would find a hard time seeking for a first occupation. 

As a sales person and someone who also interviews prospective sales people, I have an idea of their motivation for this question. They are looking for YOUR motivation to sell their products. Do you have a passion for the product line or services? Or, are you just looking to make some money? First, I would ask a question. What are the commission structures for both positions? This shows you know what sales is about, making money. No matter their response to your question, your answer should be about how you can help them and want to learn from them. You can also ask which product is their 'bread and butter' or 'up and comer' or which they feel is going to lead them into the next phase of company growth. Always respond with positive comments on both products, no matter which position gives you more financial gain or you have more interest in. If you are really green and know diddly squat about sales, the products or the industry, always (and I mean always) express interest in learning about all sides of the industry, the company and what they are selling and how you can help them. If I were interviewing I would also ask if moving between the departments at some point would be an option. I'm a stead fast believer that one must know everything they can about the business they are in to be able to sell it better.
