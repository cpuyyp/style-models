There is a broad distinction between open-class and closed-class words. Open-class are those that easily admit new members, such as verbs, nouns and adjectives. They also consist of a large number of individual words - It's a daunting task to count all the English nouns listed in any given dictionary. Closed-class are those that do not readily admit new members, such as personal pronouns (I, you), interrogative pronouns (who, what), quantifiers (all, many, one) , negative particles (not) and determiners (this, that). They also consist of a rather small number of individual words - It's easy to count all the personal pronouns of the English language. Most individual closed-class words also occur much more frequently in oral and written language than most individual open-class words. Now, frequency of occurrence happens to be one of the main factors influencing likelihood of historical change in linguistics (see, for example, Diessel (2007). Basically, the mental representation of a word is reinforced every time you hear or use it, and children are less likely to come up with innovations in language acquisition, if they hear a certain word very often. It is not true, as @Darkgamma stated, that 

This touches me on a personal level for I've tried hard my whole life to get rid of my accent, only to be told time and again I still have a strong Hispanic accent. I've learned a few interesting things on the road, though: 

The early versions of Nicaraguan Sign Language were more or less like that - these deaf-mute people would sign sentences like "I go house Pedro", "this road not good", "I want food now" and so on. As it evolved, newer speakers have added complexity onto it: agreement between verb and object, markers for time and mood, spatial references, and so on. 

Speaker verification is the task of estimating how likely it is that two speech recordings come from the same speaker, while speaker identification tries to match a speech recording with one of a greater number of candidates. Both are important forensic linguistics/phonetics tasks and crucial for law enforcement. Google and other sources told me that a range of phonetic features such as pitch range, long term formant frequencies, speech rate and articulation rate are used in these tasks. Unfortunately all sources I found were fairly general. My question is: Which of these (and other phonetic features) are considered most reliable and are most commonly used? If it's important for answering the question, I'm mostly (but not exclusively) interested in English here. Also, answers should ideally refer to (academic) sources. 

As usual, Wikipedia has a great article regarding this. Late Medieval English used "they" in the singular when the number of possible nouns was unknown or left vague on purpose by the speaker. In most other situations, then native speakers would use "he" as generic - e.g. a dog's toy was "his toy" rather than "its", and such use was sometimes used also for subjects who could potentially be either male/female. Centuries later, when first the "Politically Correctness" movement came, and then some feminists started to deride what they deemed signs of sexism in the language, the need to get a real neuter-gender alternative to he/she resulted in expanding the use of singular they. You'll also occassionally find other words invented by some feminists ex-profeso to avoid the perceived implied otherness of the feminity, mostly in feminist literature (of course). In other languages, the most natural way to refer to a sex-less 3rd person would be to use the equivalent of "it", but in English the distinction "male/female" has become very weak over time, whereas the distinction "animate/inanimate" is still perceived in full force - so the only time "it" can be applied to humans is when they're babies or very very young children. So instead of "A young teenage almost never uses contraception when having its first sexually intimate relationship " you get "(...) their first sexual (...)", as grammatically contorted as it may seem. Some papers and writers have simply inverted the common usage of "he" as generic and instead take "she" as the generic unless maleness is needed/specified, so you get more grammatical sentences whilst avoiding perceived sexism. 

Mark Davies offers a word list based on the Historical Corpus of North American English. The list indicates frequencies for each decade from 1800 to 1990, so you can choose the periods you need. Scientific texts are included in the corpus, but I don't know whether you can get a word list based on specific genres. 

I don't see any figurative element here either. "Negative Nancy" is perceived as having a negative attitude to many things, quite literally. These nicknames may be exaggerations, but that doesn't make them figurative. A figurative nickname would be "Thunderstorm Thomas" to describe an irate person. Thomas is not actually a thunderstorm, but has some quality (compared to other people) that is likened to some quality of a thunderstorm (compared to normal, calm weather). And as Dominic pointed out, your examples are alliterative - The alliteration makes these nicknames just more catchy. 

I recall that in ancient Egyptian some hieroglyphs were used "markers" to resolve ambiguity or indicate a noun was a member of a special group, even though not meant to be pronounced. E.g. a beetle sign was placed after a group of signs denoting a bird's name to indicate such noun was meant to be read as a "flying entity" (i.e. really a bird's name) and not as a person's name. There were other characters used to emphasize a noun was a person's name, and names of gods and royalty were inscribed within special cartridges. Are these signs a kind of punctuation, or mere typographical conventions? Do they have a formal name? They do transmit information, furthermore, information that's not a merely a verbatim transcription of what the actual speech said but actually expands it. Similar to when some printed media add a small cross after a person's name to indicate they're dead. Emoticons play a similar role in modern electronic communications - they expand the written message, though in this way to compensate the loss of emotional information that in face-to-face communication is transmitted mostly via physical gestures, and to a lesser extent in verbal channels that are not written down: intonation, volume and pauses in the speech. 

I am not in a position to give any legal references, but as far as I know this should be perfectly legal. In fact, many corpora that are not publicly distributed rely on material that the compilers do not have the copyright for. Moreover, Mark Davies, the compiler of the Corpus of Contemporary American English and Corpus of Historical American English thinks it is legal to (1) provide snippet views for concordance lines (2) distribute the original texts verbatim with a couple of words every 200 words removed. He argues that this falls under fair use and provides loads of copyright material in his corpora to other people. What you are planning to do is surely much less of a copyright infringement. 

Chinese dictionaries have arranged characters according to radicals for several centuries, then sorting on next level according to number of strokes. Works when you're looking for the meaning or pronunciation of a character you just saw. Some dictionaries and encyclopedias also attempted sorting by "theme": animals, plants, metals, etc. Of course, works only if you know a word and are looking for how it's written. The canonical list of radicals is taken to be that used in the Kangxi dictionary, presumed to be one of the most complete dictionaries ever made on Chinese logograms: $URL$ For Japanese I can attest the problem is solved via kana: when searching the kanji for a word you know, they're ordered according to the sorting of kana (aiueo, ka ki ku...) . When you look instead for a character's meaning or its pronunciation, though, they also use the radical + number of strokes method. As a foreign learner, you're in for some surprises for some characters' official stroke steps are not what you could intuitively think of :) 

Dialectology is the study of geographical varieties of a language. The study of (for example) older dialects of English (such as the dialect spoken in the Northeast of England around Newcastle) and more recent dialects (such as Indian or Australian English) can contribute a lot to other areas of linguistics. For example, the authors of "The Dialect Laboratory. Dialects as a testing ground for theories of language change" argue that dialectology can contribute in many ways to the study of language change. Q: Does dialectology also have something to contribute psycho- or neurolinguistics (the study of the cognitive and neural mechanisms underpinning the ability to use language)? Or the other way around? Are there any studies relying on this connection? 

For Japanese at least, both happened: sometimes the characters are used semantically, others phonetically - either according to their Chinese pronunciation (which can come from either a Northern or Southern, earlier or recent form of Chinese) or to the Japanese reading. For instance, one of the Chinese readings of the char. "origin/beginning/birth" is "hon". Now then, the Japanese word for "book" is also "hon" (don't know if its native or a Chinese/Korean borrowing). So instead of adopting the Chinese char. for "book", the Japanese use "birth/start" phonetically most of the times when they want to write "book". When char. for "now, immediately, contemporaneity" appears right before the char. for "sun/day", that specific case is a semantic usage: both together are meant to be read "ky√¥" (today). That for isolated chars. themselves. Japanese nowadays uses the chars. according to its own structure (SOV), in the very first examples of Japanese writing there's vascilation between trying to follow the S-V-O structure of Chinese or the native one. There's a lot of vacillation also regarding how to phonetically encode words in the vernacular. In A. C., Moorhouse's book "History of the alphabet" I read that something similar happened when Babylonians adopted cuneiform writing from the Summers, and then again when the Hittites adopted cuneiform from the Babylons. So, in a Hittite sample of writing, a set of chars. can be read in Hittite, in Babylon or in Sumerian, depending on context!!! 

Reasons for the use of jargon are precision and the tendency of communities (professional or otherwise) to develop their own vocabulary. Precision Members of a community, such as lawyers, might sometimes feel the need to invent new words for concepts that exist in general usage to make it clear that they are referring to a strictly defined term. This might help avoid confusion between the looser meaning of the word in general usage and the narrower meaning of the one used in specialised discourse. Another option is to take the word from general usage and (re)define it in a way that suits the needs of the professional community. For example, German Klage means both lawsuit (law jargon, among others) and complaint, lamentation. Lawyers know that Klage if used by their peers refers to a lawsuit and not a complaint without legal consequences, there is no ambiguity involved. So if precision were the only principle shaping the language of professional communities one would expect very little or at least less coining of new terms to occur, especially since redefining an existing word would be more economical than coining a whole new word. Identity Another, perhaps more important, argument I think is that communities tend to come up with their own vocabulary. This is in part because they need to refer to concepts those who do not belong to the community have no interest in or knowledge of. But jargon can also arise in cases where the concept that a new word refers to is not particularly complicated or new, such as in the examples given in the question (desist for stop). Jargon serves to create a common identity among the members of the group. If you know the jargon you belong to the group, if you don't know it everybody will notice you don't belong to the group. Spolsky (1998), for example, says that
