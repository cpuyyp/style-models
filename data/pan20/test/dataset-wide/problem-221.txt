Take something with a half life of at most a day and whose decay product normally exists in the body. Death by radiation exposure, it's decayed to effective zero by the time of autopsy. I haven't checked all the radioisotopes to see if such a beast exists, though. 

I see one big problem here but I don't know just how catastrophic it would be: There will be many things in the city that are held together simply by gravity. Remove gravity and they'll come apart. For small stuff this isn't going to be an issue as there will be a tendency to stick together anyway and there won't be any great force trying to change that. However, there will be big structures (the wall around the city if nothing else) where there is a lot of mass that has been pressing things down. Remove that mass and there will be a rebound effect--and now things aren't held down. Unless they mortared all the joints in that wall it's suddenly going to lob itself into the air. I don't know how fast the pieces will be moving so I don't know how far away they'll get when the gravity returns and the come crashing down. I'm sure there will be many other lesser examples in town, also. In many cases it doesn't take much to do big damage--think about the common design of a house with a crawlspace underneath--offset it a few inches and those supports won't be on the joists anymore. I also expect many injuries and a few deaths from people who don't know that you must make gentle movements in such conditions--a panic reaction with your legs can easily leave you moving too fast to stop yourself with your arms. Half of people who were jogging or faster outside will die--if they were heading up at the moment gravity turned off they'll wind up way up in the air when it comes back. Likewise anyone who was going up outdoor stairs. If the city has varied terrain walkers could find themselves in trouble, also--if the ground curves down (or merely less up) in front of them they'll end up in the air also. You'll also have a serious fire problem: Any uncontained fire burning pieces of fuel (think of your typical wood-burning fireplace) will have an updraft in existence when the gravity turns off--burning bits will be carried into the air. The flames will be extinguished but the bigger bits will retain enough heat to relight--and such cities lack meaningful firefighting capability. If they're not totally made of stone they'll probably burn down. 

Anything in the atmosphere is a balloon, not a moon, no matter how big it is. Given that restriction I see a way to get something like what you're after (note, though, that it will have no surface gravity!) Life arose on the gas giant. This was problematic as it had a tendency to fall and get squashed/roasted. Fast-living single-cell organisms could survive due to turbulence (many are thrown down and die, some are thrown up and survive) but as you start getting bigger this becomes a non-viable strategy. Non-microscopic life is limited to wings or buoyancy as a route to survival. Buoyancy can be subdivided into lighter-than-air and hot-air approaches. Thus we have three means of survival, two of which take a fair amount of energy to sustain. This makes lighter-than-air a very desirable approach if you can pull it off. On a terrestrial planet you could split water and fill a gas bag with hydrogen, but a gas giant is mostly hydrogen. Thus you need something lighter than hydrogen and there's only one possible candidate: nothing. Thus we have a critter that grows hollow, evacuated crystals within it's body. Now, consider a coral reef--a structure built up of the dead bodies of the ancestors of the creatures living on it's surface. Your "moon" is a vast "coral" reef floating in the atmosphere. 

How hard? Depends on the reliability you want. Take two near-critical masses of U-235, machined so they don't need precise assembly (put a cone on one, an inverted cone on the other--if they aren't aligned perfectly they'll align themselves), put one one in your left hand, one in your right. Slam them together. Your death is certain. There's a reasonable chance you take a city with you. 

Did the species evolve at all? Or are we looking at genetic engineering at work? I find the latter hypothesis far more likely as it seems unlikely that photosynthesis is of any substantial value to a land animal. Average solar incident energy is ~1000W/m^2 not counting clouds, this averages down to 400W/m^2 over a 24 hour cycle. Unfortunately, I'm not having much luck on finding the vertical cross section of a human but I did stumble upon .2 m^2 and this is a bit above what I get trying to ballpark my own body. This means there is about 80W of incident energy. The best we see from plants is about a 2% conversion efficiency--said dryad will only get 1.6 watts of power from the photosynthesis. Said human has a resting energy use of about 100W. Photosynthesis thus will provide only 1.6% of the body's energy if the sun is overhead. Facing directly towards (or away from) the sun will raise this to 3.2% of the body's resting energy. Note that this only applies in a near ideal climate where the body does not need to expend energy on heating or cooling. As soon as you leave such an environment you either expend energy on temperature control or you cover up--cutting the photosynthetic intake. Given the limited value I do not believe such an evolution is possible. 

I think we need to look at mixing two ideas in order to build a viable low-tech weapons system: First, lets look at missiles. You're wrong about evading them--the missile has the advantage here as it's much cheaper to move a missile than a ship. You'll burn up the target's fuel trying to evade your missiles, eventually evasion isn't going to work. However, a countermissile is going to be a lot smaller than a missile, given roughly comparable ships I would expect the countermissiles to win. (Lets look at the closest equivalent we have: Anti-ship missiles vs SAMs. The anti-ship missiles are a lot bigger and more expensive and the only way to get them through good defenses is to swarm the defenses with more rounds than can be shot down.) Lacking the ability to saturate defenses in some means (note that this depends on tracking range. If missiles can only be detected at short range you might be able to get them through based on a lack of reaction time) they're pretty useless. Various ballistic projectiles have been suggested but that's going to need some awfully accurate gunnery. If you could aim them adequately they would be very nasty as they're much smaller and lighter than a countermissile, simply keep firing and you'll get through when their magazine runs dry. The accuracy of shooting is a serious issue, though. Also, nukes have been suggested--there is no blast wave in space, you have to get close enough for a thermal or radiation kill. That's pretty darn close. Thus I suggest two variations on a theme: Fragmentation rounds. Version A: This is based on a missile. It does not attempt to hit it's target, though, a miss distance of a km or two is fine. Thus it doesn't need to use it's engine much if at all on approach, it's going to be much harder to find. Put a stealthy coating on it and it's going to be still harder to find. In time I expect the defenders to pick it up and shoot it down--but too late. The thing is it's simply trying to get close. Its warhead fires and a whole bunch of high speed fragments are heading for the target. Since they are fired from nearby the accurate gunnery problem is avoided. Being little fragments they're very hard to shoot down. It also has a salvage-fuse mode, when it detects an incoming interceptor (thermal source with a zero bearing rate and parallax detectable to a pair of cameras) it fires anyway, albeit with a lower chance of a hit. Version B is a shorter-range version of the same thing, it's fired from a big gun or like system rather than carried on a missile. The upgraded versions use a nuke to propel the fragments. 

If the spark is created inside the cartridge the powder will go off. Without being properly confined by the gun the imparted velocity is low (and is mostly to the cartridge rather than the bullet), about the only way you could get a serious injury is if a piece went into an eye. However, there are two other factors at work: 1) It's still fire. The energy released will find a way out, period. The strongest part of the gun (the firing chamber itself) will blow up if the pressure can't be vented normally by propelling the bullet. With a semi-auto gun the extra energy is ejected out the front and normally harms nobody. With a revolver the seal between the part holding the bullets and the rest of the barrel isn't perfect and enough energy can vent there to cause serious injury if you have your finger in the wrong place when you fire it. In this case the energy is either going to burst the magazine or vent where the magazine connects to the gun. In either case I would expect at a minimum second degree burns to the person with the gun. 2) Again, the energy must go somewhere. The weakest point will give, I would expect the magazine to be ejected with considerable force. Nothing lethal but I certainly wouldn't want to be the guy in it's path. 

So long as your planet isn't too massive this is at the edge of what can be built, unobtainium makes it easier but isn't essential. Bridge #2: Build a ring around the planet, supported by the elevators. You can do this with a single elevator if the ring and elevator are unobtainium, otherwise you need at least three points. Bridge #3: Another ring around the planet, outside the first ring but touching it with magnetic levitation support (or anything else frictionless if you're going the unobtainium route.) This ring is not rotating in relation to the central star. Obviously there is a considerable velocity difference here, some sort of transport craft will be needed for velocity matching unless you go with Heinlien's rolling roads approach. (Which would take a lot of velocity-matching segments!) For engineering ease the net force of #2 and #3 combined is zero, the elevator connections are only for stability. Unobtainium will make the construction of #2 and #3 much easier but it could be done without. If the orbits are perfectly circular: Bridge #4: A ring around the star. This is connected to #3. Unobtainium or stationkeeping engines are required. You build an equivalent system around the second planet. Bridge #5: This hangs from the ring around the outer planet, a counterweight hangs in the opposite direction to give a net zero weight. It extends to the inner ring, again speed-matching shuttles are required. If the orbits are not perfectly circular it gets harder: Bridge #4a: This is in space between the two planets. Stationkeeping engines are mandatory as it is not anchored to anything. Unobtainium is required. Bridge #5a: This rides a track on #4 (speed matching issues apply) so as to remain aligned with the planet. It dangles halfway to the planet plus half of the orbital variation of the planet. It is counterweighted. Bridge #5b: This is connected to #3 and extends outward and is counterweighted. It has the same length as #5a. #5a and #5b are aligned so as to be coaxial at all times but are only coupled by magnetic levitation or the like as #5b will move up and down with the planet. A pornographic nickname is inevitable for this pair. Unobtainium is required. Keeping the counterweights from #5a and #5b from striking their opposite bridge will be quite a project. A second pair of bridges connects #4 to the other planet. If you wish to extend this system to additional planets you can reuse #1, #2 and #3. I can see no means of handling planets which are not coplanar.
