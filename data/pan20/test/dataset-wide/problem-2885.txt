This question is almost more of an economics question, but I suppose it could be a philosophy or politics question too. It is indeed a false dichotomy. It would not be, if the economy were a closed environment and thus a zero sum game. However, the sun gives the planet energy which humans can then use to expand the technosphere: the total system of all things created, used, and shared by humans, and there is a lot of energy available to us to use, for millions, if not hundreds of billions of years. Therefore one human does not have to diminish another person's wealth in order to gain wealth. People can work together to collectively increase wealth, through various methods, including reciprocity, consumerism, capitalism, and so on. Connection The connection between my answer and the question seems to have been misunderstood, so let me try to explain it in better detail. Because economics is not a zero sum game, everyone can become "rich." The existence of a "poor" group is not necessary in order for there to be a rich group and vise versa. Furthermore, neither "poor" or "rich" have to be defined in terms of the other. What does it mean to be poor? Economically, it means not having enough resources to reasonably survive, long term, without the immediate and constant aid of another. What does it mean to be rich? It means having enough resources in order to be able to do what you wish, without the need to expend additional energy in order to maintain that status. Under these two definitions, it is clear that a society could be made up entirely of rich people. In this scenario, no one would need to work in order to "make a living." In order for such a society to exist, I think we would need to have a significant advancement in energy availability however. Such advancement could include efficient nuclear fusion, access to the currently theoretical and certainly debated "zero point energy," or some other form of yet to be discovered energy reservoir, as well as technology which would be able to efficiently translate that energy into production, such as a replicator. Dichotomy On the specific issue of dichotomy, while "poor" and "rich" do not need to be defined in terms of the other, and while we do not need poor people in order for there to be rich people, I would say that one cannot be both poor and rich. They are mutually exclusive. You can however be neither poor or rich. Both of these points follow from the definitions that I provided. 

I don't understand how the fail to settle all disputes implies that one couldn't settle many of them. The only possibility I see is using the meaning of "all" as "all disputes of a certain class" as such that this class does not contain all possible disputes. 

Suppose you have two theories: T₁,T₂. Each one has a proposition that makes the other become contradictory. Question 1: Is it always possible to find a theory T₃ which conciliates both theory, that is: "removes the contradiction"? Question 2: Supposing the answer to the first question is affirmative, does it imply that we can prove anything to be true? I know the answer with logic, this will depend on the axioms and rules of inference of the logic you are using. But how they face this problem with Derrida's conception of languange? 

In mathematics, it seems that when we try to find relations about objects we are forced to set a unique object as a basis for the construction of each other object. For example: take one rectangle and define It's area as b•h, now if you take a line through Its center, it will allow you to cut the rectangle in two having its area divided in two pieces (b•h/2). Now if you rotate the line in a way that it passes through two vertices of the rectangle, then you have a triangle and it has the same area: (b•h/2). Now for the area of the circle, we need to make a comparison between what we made and we can do that by inscribing a regular polygon and taking the limit of its sides to infinity, that is: it's measure will depend on the sum of a infinity of triangles. Even in integral calculus, the area under the curves is defined as the sum of an infinity of rectangles, consequently: An infinity of triangles. And hence, the triangle seems to be the most basic object found when building these relations. Does this effect have a name? Has someone written about it? If yes, who? 

As virmalor pointed out, last Thursdayism is not that literal. It is the assertion that the universe came into existence in a preconfigured state, at some point in time, as opposed to developing from an actual big bang, etc. Unfortunately, there is no way to tell the difference between the two, so long as the preconfiguration is "correct." There is no difference, from an internal perspective, between a 14 billion year old universe and a universe that is only 10 days old but was preconfigured as if it were "running" for 14 billion years. But suppose part of the universe appeared to be about 14 billion years old, while another part appeared to be only 7 billion years old, because the preconfiguration was not consistent with the physics of the universe from that point on, then we could surmise that something funky is going on in the universe and we might say that it was preconfigured. 

I have an idea as to why it might be valid, but I would like confirmation, rebuttals, or maybe just better answers. 

From "Alchemy" (1995) by Eric John Holmyard: "the symbols for fire, air, water, and earth indicat the property of the first two to ascend and that of the second two to descend..." So fire and air face upward while water and earth face downward. I am not 100% certain about the lines themselves, but you might be able to find more information in the book. They seem to indicate the "top" and "bottom" however, with water and fire in the middle. This site, while not as scholarly, may provide additional information. Notice that if you overlay air and earth, the extra lines do connect, suggesting a relationship between the two elements. 

When I was a kid, I remind that I had a strange type of game - I was mostly concerned of annoying other persons. Whenever they assumed something, I asked why, and then when they aswered, I asked why again, and then I kept asking why until the person was annoyed. There was a point where the person could not provide an answer to the why's, I always wondered if our knowledge behaves this way: This way of having an infinite series of why's and at some point, a nullity of answers. So, is this infinity of questions a problem somehow? Have someone thought about it? 

Is there a branch of philosophy that deals with the concept of classification? I guess that perhaps it's metaphysics or ontology - they are the nearest things I can think of, but I'm not really sure. 

I'm still in the beginning of the book and I've read this in the introduction, so what's so speculative in rationalists metaphysics? 

I'm not really specialized in the history of science. But it seems for me that as the time passed, the exact sciences tried to do that. For example: The second is measured in relation to the spinning of the electron along the nucleus of the atom and they tried to obtain mathematical certainty with methods that could be computed outside of mathematicians (this was part of the Hilbert's program). I believe that this happened because of the belief that we are bad observers and that there are some environments which are really not observable, for example: The set of all natural numbers. So, does this trend have a name? I'd like to read more about it - supposing it is actually something that happened and not just something I made up. 

The question is a bit unclear, however "future research" may refer to research that might be done to provide more insight into a topic. A lot of times the results of a study are unclear and so future research is needed in order to make a theory more robust. This condition often arises in proposed medical treatment. Future research, and predictions about the outcomes of that research, are how we move science forward. As an example, I have proposed "future research" into a number of different questions. A Chinese study on asymptomatic pertussis carriage, for instance, suggests the need to do a similar study in the United States. I have concluded that if the rate of carriage is similar, future research will reveal a high number of previously unrecognized infections. 

The final question is the "easiest" to answer. Our current method of determining whether or not a computer is "conscious" is to see if we can tell it apart from a human. This test is called the Turing Test. If, after talking to both computers running the AI and actual people, we cannot tell who is who, we say that the AI has passed the Turing Test. Is this test really able to determine if an AI is conscious? No. But then again, we cannot really tell whether or not anyone we are talking to is really conscious. Will an AI ever be created which at least appears conscious? I think so. The processing power of computers is still evolving rapidly. Machine learning has certainly made great strides. But it will still take a while before true AI (what is not referred to as artificial general intelligence) to come into being. As for what is needed, that is a harder question to answer. There are a number of theories on the topic. My personal theory is related to language. I think that we need to have an AI that has an outer voice and an inner voice, much the same way that we talk to ourselves to work through problems. I also think that we need a better test. The current Turing Test is either an all or nothing result. It does not tell us how far off the mark we are or in what direction we need to move. 

I've been thinking a bit about the core argument of social constructionism. Whenever I see the argument being employed, it seems that it means that if something is a social construction, then this thing is not too legitimate. This seems to agree a bit with Hacking here. I've noticed that I could take the argument itself and write: "The idea of social construction is a social construction. Then the idea of social construction is not too legitimate." At least for me, this seems to be a logical problem: An instance of the liar's paradox, with the argument eating itself. Is it actually a problem or the argument is built in an ideological framework unbeknownst to me in which this problem could be eliminated? I know that there are logics that deal with self-reference. But I don't know if the person who created the concept worked with these logics and conscientiously created the concept using it or if he/she didn't see that one could apply the argument to itself. 

I'm reading David Papineau's Philosophical Devices, and there's a section on numbers and set theory. But there's not deeper hint on why it's important to philosophy. I guess that in mathematics we can think of formulas for building the elements of some set, such as the set of even numbers, the set of odd numbers, the set of all the prime numbers (which I guess that until this date, have no formula) so perhaps it's important to make formulas for some objects in philosophy? I guess I can see the importance of the knowledge of the axiom of comprehension (and the Russell set), which states that for any condition C, there exists a set A such that (for any x)(x is an element of A iff x satisfies C). It is there to remind us that such axiom can't hold without some exceptions. Although I fail to see where one would create an object (in philosophy) and then notice a similarity of this object and Russell's set. Note: If you know better tags, please edit. I've tried to use the tag set theory, but It does not exist. 

There are many differences between the two. Intelligent design is a theory. Archaeology is a field of scientific investigation. Fields of scientific investigation have their own theories, methods of constructing and testing theory, etc. So the first difference is a matter of scale and scope. It is kind of like asking what the difference is between one song and an album. The second difference is the type of album on which you would find intelligent design. As Alex pointed out, intelligent design is not complete from a scientific perspective. It contains elements which cannot be used to make a prediction which could falsify them. This lack of falsifiability is key to determining whether or not a theory is scientific or not. I am not sure that it has zero predictive power, because intelligent design is essentially all of current evolutionary theory, with a single key modification: god can mess with the process and has. As long as we assume that god isn't meddling with a specific aspect of the process, then we make predictions as normal. For instance, we would still expect antibiotic resistance, etc. But once we assume god is "working in mysterious ways" then all bets are off. 

I have wondered this too. One general definition of philosophy is "the act of questioning what we think we know." Your question is certainly philosophical. If you engage in philosophical discussion and add to the body of philosophical thought, then you are a philosopher. To be an "academic" philosopher you need to get your material recognized by the academic community. This usually requires a degree, but so long as you publish in a peer reviewed journal, then it is reasonable to say that you are an academic philosopher. Also, if you make money off of what you discuss (peer reviewed or not) then it is reasonable to call yourself a professional philosopher. I do not generally like these titles however, as being a professional or even an academic philosopher does not mean that you are a good one. Likewise, if you have not been published in a peer reviewed journal and are not making a living off of your discourses, that does not mean that you are a bad philosopher.
