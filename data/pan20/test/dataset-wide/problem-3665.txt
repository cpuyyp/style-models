Barbell rows and dumbbell rows are excellent options, but don't forget dead lifts. The shrugs and pullups, while awesome exercises, do the least for the muscles you are wanting to hit. If you are doing barbell rows and/or dumbbell rows, the seated rows don't add anything. Instead, focus on volume. You'll want to go as heavy as you can. If you are more concerned with size than using a lift in competition (like deadlifts), then I recommend getting some weightlifting straps. They will let you lift heavier without your grip limiting your back work. To get some size it needs to be worked hard with a lot of volume. 

That slows the progression on the rows, but gives you more volume with it. That will build some back muscle, and help with your body's ability to endure back work. This is also the rep ranges that seem to work better for assistance exercises in my opinion. Alternative to Pendlay Rows If I were to pick my personal favorite row variation, it would be the dumbbell row. More specifically, it's the kneeling single arm dumbbell row also known as Kroc rows. They help build your grip for deadlifts, hit the lats better, harder to cheat at, and are just better supported. 

I've been looking into the same thing, and depending on your goals you might benefit from the research I've done so far. So first, let's start by being honest with ourselves. You are totally new to weight lifting, so you want these two things down first: 

Physiology does in fact have a lot to do with how hard or how easy an exercise is to learn. Even more so when weightlifting is involved. While height is a factor, the real determiner is the length of your limbs in proportion to each other. Squats Squats favor people with shorter femurs. In general, shorter people have short femurs and taller people have longer femurs. However, that's not always the case. We've all seen people with shorter torsos and the legs make up the difference in height. Essentially, to reach parallel, the crease in the hip has to go below the top of the patella. The longer the femur, the further down you have to go to accomplish that. Deadlifts Deadlifts favor people with longer arms. In general, shorter people have shorter arms and taller people have longer arms. The key here is that the longer arms help you get your back in a stronger, more favorable position, and you don't have to lift the bar as high. Bench Press Bench press favors people with shorter arms and larger chests. In general, this applies to shorter people. In essence, a larger chest minimizes the distance down the bar has to go to reach the bottom of the movement. The shorter arms minimize the distance the bar has to go up to achieve full range of motion and lock out. What's Easier Doesn't Mean Stronger Simple physics demonstrate that just because an exercise is easier doesn't mean you are doing more work. The idea behind weight lifting is to generate more force to move heavier weights. In the world of Olympic lifts, the goal is to generate more power to move heavier weights in shorter amounts of time. Example: 

As to major muscle groups that can take a pounding and come back for more, any of your core muscles are game. That includes your abs, back, obliques. You could do planks every day without affecting your your main lifts--as long as you don't do them right before the main lifts. If you are running Starting Strength or StrongLifts, they don't have any curls and they tell you that pull-ups are way better, blah, blah, blah. As a heavy guy, I'm still working on being able to do one pull-up, and the strain it puts on my tendons is a bit much. Adding curls once a week for 3 sets of 10 can help strengthen the tendons and balance your strength in your arms so you don't get elbow tendinitis (or you can correct it if you already have it). That's just a tidbit I recently discovered, and it helps a lot. 

NOTE: if you have any aspirations of doing Olympic lifts consider that you would likely need a platform which are usually 8'x8'. You can make your platform, but your power rack does not sit on it. Make sure you have enough space. More advanced strength training and olympic lifts: When you start moving heavy iron, or you need to do some of the advanced olympic lifts your first bar just isn't going to be up to the task. It will probably bend and and warp will set once you've maxed out what your bar can do. It's at this point that you need to do some research on the best set of equipment. When you are at this level, you really do need to purchase good equipment. There are a few things to look out for: 

Running downhill in a controlled manner can provide more resistance to your hamstrings--provided you aren't trying to go too fast. However, each and every step is going down a greater distance, which compounds the stress to the knee. In order to get the most work out of the hill, and to protect yourself from injury: 

One of the benefits of doing squats, deadlifts, overhead presses, etc. without a machine is the opportunity to work your stabilizer and supporting muscles more effectively. You lose a lot of that with the Smith machine. The question I have for you is, are there no barbells at all? If not, is there another alternative gym available to you? If there are barbells, but need help for ideas of how to do the lifts you need while standing you can either "Clean" the weight for a front squat and overhead press, or you can perform the Steinborn lift for back squats. If there are no barbells, then when you are gym shopping make sure they have: 

My first recommendation is for patience. In particular, gaining mass at a rate that brings with it more muscle size than fat requires a good deal of patience. 

Short answer: barefoot is better than running shoes. Long Answer: Running shoes are designed for providing a cushion to your feet. In essence, they absorb the impact of your foot hitting the ground by compressing the sole and springing back. This is not the behavior you want when you have more than a couple hundred pounds on your back. With that much weight, the soles will start to compress and as you push with your feet you lose stability. That's really bad. I recommend reading this article by Dr. Lon Kilgore on weightlifting shoes 101. Now to answer your question: 

How sharp is the pain? If we are talking about a dull feeling of pressure in the lower lumbar pressure that is quite uncomfortable then we are probably talking about back pump. Any muscle can get a pump, and after 20 rep sets it's pretty much a given. However, if the pain is sharp, then we might be looking at a strain or tear. Dealing with Back Pump Back pump is just the same phenomenon as when your biceps get pumped after doing a lot of curls. The only difference is that the location of the pump is very uncomfortable. Just as 20 minutes away from the bar will clear up a bicep pump, the same is generally true for the back pump. The only difference is that the muscles are larger so it can take a little longer for that discomfort to dissipate. Back pump is only uncomfortable, but it is associated with fatigue. Considering that 20 rep squats are very fatiguing to the body, you may want to focus on rep ranges between 6-12 and just do more sets. Dealing with Back Strain A strain in your muscle is a very sharp pain, that occurs whenever you cause damage to the muscle. Here's the important thing: a damaged muscle needs time to repair. That means you'll have to: 

One option to help your grip even more is on the last rep, hold the lockout for as long as you can. You can breath during this time, and in fact this is one of the better ways to teach yourself to breath while exerting yourself. NOTE: during the entire lift, the only job your back muscles have is to keep your back straight. You change the angle of your back with your glutes and hamstrings. This will protect your back from injury. I'm pulling over 405lb on deadlifts now. Occasionally I have a back pump, which while uncomfortable is not the same as a back injury. Option 2: Farmers Walks Farmers walks have a heavy weight in each hand, and you carry that weight over distance. Your body needs to be erect, and try to prevent your shoulders from dropping forward. These do well for conditioning as well as building your grip strength. While they do improve your core, it is not to the same degree as the deadlift. 

Your best bet is to split it into even doses throughout the day. Your body will make good use of it. Now, if you have some before bed, it won't hurt. Essentially, at night when you sleep, two types of adaptations will happen (assuming you have disrupted homeostasis): 

Many anabolic diets bank on the thermogenic properties of protein to help burn body fat while building muscle. My guess, when looking at the two meals you ate, the better body core temperature was more because of the higher amount of protein (4 eggs vs. the peanut butter) than it did with the capsaisin content of the hot sauce. You may want to make a few more passes at alternating these two meals to be positive--at least for your body. Try the following experiments at least 3 times each to make sure it was related to your diet to begin with: 

With every action, there is a proper and correct technique to do it safely. This applies to every action from throwing a baseball, shot put, discus, to swinging a bat or manipulating melee weapons. The danger lies in failure to do the technique properly. This is why each of these activities are typically taught by an instructor and with little or no load. The consequences of swinging a 5 lb bat with bad form is going to be much less than the consequence of swinging a 95lb weight with bad form. Proper form in each of these typically keeps the thoracic portion of the torso rigid, or in the correct orientation so that the load is absorbed top to bottom as opposed from side to side.
