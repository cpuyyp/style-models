Try to do that several times a week and really try to apply yourself. Although you can still get injured with body weight exercises, it's a lot harder to manage that than with weights. As always, try to "own" the exercise by mastering the movements. If you can only do one push-up correctly then that one push-up trumps ten done incorrectly. Think to yourself, "How do I make this perfect?" rather than "How many of these can I do?" I suggest you apply the same principle to every exercise you do. As someone who swims about 6-7k a week, I can tell you that technique and form in swimming is everything. Look on YouTube (I like "Effortless Swimming") for proper swimming technique and drills and try to master the swim. Some final parting advice: Try to make fitness a focal point for the rest of your life. You don't need to be Michael Phelps, or a star bodybuilder, or a pro at any of it. However, when you're in your 30's, 40's, and beyond, you'll start to notice changes in your body that'll make you wish that you had done a little more. It's hard to impress that upon someone who's 16 because it probably seems so far away to you. Focus on making your form perfect in everything you do, workout hard but don't kill yourself, eat clean, stay away from the toxic things, and you'll really reap a lot of rewards from it. If you can do that, then in 6 months to a year, I promise you that you'll love what's staring back at you in the mirror. Don't focus on immediate results, man, just stay on the path, and you'll be so much better off. I wish you the best of luck and hope that I've answered your question, if not lectured a little more. I've gone on at length because I regret not having done something even sooner than I did. 

I have found that lifting heavy helps with pain in my joints. As such I have no particular goal like muscle gain or endurance, etc. Its just that I don't go for too low reps and rapid progression so that my joints have enough time to adapt to higher resistance. Lifting heavy increases my appetite. I don't eat a lot, only as per my appetite. So, I have gained some amount of muscle but also some disproportionate fat deposition around my lower abs and hips (because of a certain medical condition I have) which I am supposed to avoid. I do compound lifts 4 days a week, 3 sets of 10 reps. I don't have much time or equipment for cardio. Is there a way I can tweak my workout regime in terms of reps, etc. so that it causes greater fat burn and I can do without much cardio? 

I have a strength imbalance in both side of my hips as well as obliques. For this reason, I tend to descend somewhere towards left (my stronger side) and not in the middle during squats. I also find step ups more difficult on my weaker side. I have been to PT's, they couldn't fix it despite lots of sessions. Also, I can't afford for more. And trying to address obliques directly (like side planks) causes a lower back pain - it's more like pinching sensation. I have heard that treating it as problem in form may be a solution. Meaning reducing load to one in which I can maintain proper form and then working upwards should resolve the issue. Does this how it really works? I have been very sedentary due to lots of unresolved injuries for long. Looks like I'm a starter again and starting with very low weights now... 

As someone who has finally started incorporating triathlon training into my routines (been swimming and running a while), I think the two are vastly different. I started running long before I was swimming. When I jumped in the pool the first time, despite my cardio health, I couldn’t swim 25m. After months spent practicing form, endless repetitions, etc... I’m good for a mile or two. Running is going to be somewhat similar. Your body is going to have to overcome the initial shock of this new activity. Your heart rate will be higher, your legs will be more involved, and there will be minor little injuries you’re going to have the joy of discovering. I can’t run every day. My body won’t allow it. There has to be recovery time for me. It’s a far more intense (for me) exercise than swimming. You need to build up to 30 minutes - that’ll be roughly 5-5.5k for most novices. 

As someone who trains triathlon and has suffered badly from a cervical disc herniation, I suggest you stick with swimming for quite a while. The flat truth is that swimming is unique. I can run for miles and bike for hours, but the first time I got in the pool, swimming 25m was ridiculously hard. Swimming is almost entirely about technique. There is an endurance factor to it but once your technique gets better, turning 250m into a mile is actually not that big of a leap. For several months, there is a very real likelihood you will develop a significant amount of muscle with swimming. I know I gained about 8 pounds of (mostly) muscle when I started - most noticeably in my lats, shoulders, traps, triceps, and chest. I think the idea is to swim to support growth in other avenues. Focus on your technique, and build your core swim development up. It will take some time but you’ll also make progress relatively quickly. Swimming did improve my run and my bike but I can honestly say that I don’t think the run and bike help my swim at all. It’s a unique animal, fantastic exercise, and probably the safest thing you can do. 

I find my right foot arch tends to flatten during lunges. How can I hold my arches? Any cues? There is no pain associated with this. I have imbalance of strength in both hips and legs. So, I incorporated single leg exercises in addition to squats and deadlifts.... 

After having pushed myself too hard on incorrect form and nursing multiple injuries, I want to start lifting afresh under a coach. My goal is to gain strength without gain in size, though I wouldn't mind if it comes as a natural consequence. This time, I want to be very, very particular about form. In my place, trainers at commercial gym are body-building oriented and not that particular about details of correct form. I am planning to train under a powerlifting coach. However, I have a few concerns. I have come across ideas like powerlifters aren't very concerned about form, their main focus is to lift as heavy as they can. This idea probably came from a few figure-competitors and body-builders. Just want to know if there is any truth in the above statement? 

I have a pair of dumbbells and access to a few machines. I can do the following exercises with proper form and I can't have a trainer to learn newer exercises now. Lower body: Lunges, Bulgarian split squat, step up, hamstring curls Abs and back: Back extension, plank, side plank Upper body: bench press / push up, chest flies, shoulder press, shoulder front and lateral raise, rear delt flies, rows (not sure about form though), lat pull I'm not able to figure out which pair of exercises balance each other and if all muscle groups get hit with the above exercises. 

Make you more aware of how much exercise erases from what you ate. Hint: It’s not nearly as much as most of us would like. You’ll begin to recognize different foods for their caloric content. Go out to eat with friends? You can look at a menu and get a great idea of the “damage” you’re about to do. This can help keep things to a minimum, especially with limited healthy options available. Perhaps most important is that you’ll start to find where calories are adding up. Sometimes there are healthy, albeit calorie dense foods in one’s diet that significantly rack up the calorie count. That doesn’t mean you should stay away from them, but rather may need to cut back a little. Nuts and avocados are offenders of this - great for you, but watch how much you eat! 

Burpees. Pull-ups. Push-ups. Dips. Inverted rows Air squats (single leg if needed) Clams (bring a resistance band) Planks, crunches, sit-ups More burpees. Oh and burpees. Try to eat "real" food in moderation. Veggies, lean meats, and more veggies. 

There are some warnings about rounded shoulders and swimming that I've seen. I am not familiar with it being an issue with APT, but I suppose it could be. My rounded shoulders took almost a year of weightlifting with two back days a week to resolve. I also had to couple that with making a very conscious effort to correct my posture whenever possible. More specifically, focusing on exercises that zeroed in on my rear delts, lower traps, and rhomboids, really seemed to do the best. Jeff Cavalier has an excellent video on how to fix this. I have been performing these exercises as well for the past 4-5 months and have felt a lot of improvements with it. I did swim a lot in this time frame as well, and actually felt like I had a lot of "upper-middle" back activation along with the lats. I had some mild APT that actually resolved itself when I started doing "The World's Greatest Stretch" for extended periods of time. I started slow, just like anything, and worked up to about a 5 minute hold on each side. If I did this right before bed, I could really feel the difference the next day. 

I have read about pull ups/chin up. Is there anything I can do with a barbell? My workout regime now consists of squats, deadlift, lunges, bench press, rows and overhead press. 

Similar things would happen to me while doing cardio in winters. For me, it happened due to sinusitis. My sinuses would burn when I inhale comparitively cold and dry air at a faster rate (as in increased rate of breathing during exercise). It causes me mild headache in addition to phlegm and runny nose. I found that using certain specific oils (they call it 'nasya' in ayurveda, don't want to be advertising brands here) to instil in nose helped moisturize the nasal passage and my sinuses and nosy don't act up anymore. I found that doing nasya is great as expectorant and helps me 'do normal' during cardios without phlegm and stuff. However, you would want to be sure that it is due to sinusitis before you decide on trying out nasya. hope this helps.... 

From last 6 months, I started with a knee issue and I find gradually more and more joints like hips, shoulder, ankle becoming noisy (as in popping/ snapping /noises like rubbing of cartilage) and sometimes accompanied by pain and it is becoming scary. I don't have ortho/PT specializing in sports medicine in my place and the rest haven't been of much help. One PT however did tell I have muscle imbalance, which I realize I do because of thoroughly unbalanced training and neglect in stretching. But again he didn't mention which muscles and said I can do all kind of exercises I want, that I actually can't. I can't do exercises involves running, twisting and jumping and fast movements as in martial arts. I was wondering if starting a balanced barbell training under a trainer and stretching sufficiently a good idea. I mean is that what people with joint issues do when they can't get medical help due to whatever reason. It might look like paralysis by analysis but I started treatment with a PT with open mind and ended up worsening pain in my knees. This has made a skeptic out of me... I'm not sure if this kind (unspecific?) question is entertained is this forum.
