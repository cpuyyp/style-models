Sirius is moving towards the sun at 5.5 km/s, and according to Sky and Telescope, will reach its closest distance in 60000 years, at which time it will be 7.8 light years distant, and be at magnitude -1.64, only slightly brighter than it's current magnitude -1.46. Calculations using the latest Hippacos results give a slightly different value: a closest approach of 8.18 ly in 46000 years, and consequently a slightly dimmer peak. However Sirius is not moving rapidly relative to the sun, and will not change its brightness greatly in the next 100000 years or so It will be the brightest star in the sky for another 90000 years, and no star will match its current brightness for another million years (when delta Scuti will reach magnitude -1.84. 

Dating cometary material is tricky, just because you have to go to space to get it. But the dates from the "stardust" mission show that comets are very very old. As old as the oldest asteroids, and date back to the origin of the solar system. Now while there is evidence that material that formed in the inner solar system when the sun was young, and the planets still forming, was carried to the outer solar system. There is no suggestion that this process is ongoing. There is no astrononomical water cycle. Although the planets might lose a little water to solar wind. It is very very little. Earth is protected by a magnetic field. Mars has lost all its water already, as has Venus, and Mercury probably never had much. 

Most Oort cloud objects stay in the Oort cloud, and we never see them. Comets don't last long. A comet is made of a mixture of ices and dust. A comet that enters the inner solar system has one of a few outcomes: 

The calculations seem reasonable. The conclusion is wrong. The Earths antumbra starts 1.3 Gm from Earth. At less than 1.3 Gm there is umbra, penumbra and non-shadow. The moon is 0.4 Gm from Earth. $$0.4 < 1.3$$ Hence it is impossible for the moon to be in the Earth's antumbra. However, the Moon's antumbra forms at almost exactly one lunar distance. We notice that the moon and the sun are almost exactly the same size in the sky. When the moon is further from the Earth, an annular eclipse can form, as a small part of the Earth will then be in the moon's antumbra. I've made a scale model of the sun-earth-moon shadows, at $URL$ 

It shows that the mass of the (proto)star is the major factor determining bolometric magnitude. The brightness of the proto-star increases a little as it contracts and becomes significantly hotter (and the radius decreases), The star moves toward the left of the diagram. As fusion in the core becomes significant the star reaches the maximum point on the curve, this stabilises the core and the star settles into the main sequence, it cools slightly and becomes slightly less bright. 

Everyone expected exoplanets to exist - there was no reason to suppose that the conditions that existed when the sun formed were unique, and we knew that multiple star systems were common. Newton wrote "And if the fixed stars are the centres of similar systems, they will all be constructed according to a similar design" Observations in the 80s were not ignored, they just lacked sufficient evidence. I.e, they were considered and properly rejected. Better observations have since confirmed some of the planets that were "discovered" in the 80s, but denied others. Scientific scepticism means that you don't accept something without evidence. We knew that finding planets would be hard. The technology of sensitive ccd devices that could be used for constant monitoring of multiple stars didn't exist in a form that could be put on a space telescope, and there were other priorities for space science: solar system exploration. Knowing that planets would be impossible to observe with contempory technology meant that "planet hunting" wasn't a thing. The first planet to be detected was around a pulsar, as the detection depends on changes in the timing of the pulsar, not on measurements of variations in light intensity during a transit, or doppler shift as the star is wobbled. 

The moon's orbital plane is inclined to the ecliptic at about 5.5 degrees, and a solar eclipse can only occur when the moon crosses the ecliptic during a new moon. A total solar eclipse can only occur when the apparent size of the moon exceeds that of the sun, when the moon is at apogee (greatest distance from Earth) an annular eclipse, in which the edge of sun appears as a ring encircling the moon, occurs. The next annular eclipse will be visible from central africa on the 26th of September 2016, A few people in Southern Congo will this, and a second eclipse in February 2017. 

The position of a planet is determined by 6 numbers First there are the eccentricity and semi-major-axis. These give the shape and size of the ellipse. By Kepler Law, the sun is at one focus of this ellipse, Then there is the plane in which the orbit is placed. This can be conveniently determined by the angle between the planet's or it and the elliptical, and the position of the point where the orbit crosses the plane: the longitude of the ascending node. Finally there is the position of the planet on this path. The angular position the ginger to me hard at some reference time(the mean anomaly at epoch) and the amount of time passing since the epoch. 

A type 1a supernova forms when a white dwarf grows through accretion to a certain size, at which it becomes unstable. This means that the precursor object is always a white dwarf of mass 1.39 solar masses. As the precursor object is always of the same type and the same size, the supernova is thought to be the same brightness. On the other hand, type II supernovae form from the collapse of giant stars. The precursor object can have a range of masses from about 10 Solar masses, to a maximum of over 100. The brightness of the supernova depends on the mass of the precursor (and other factors such as the metallicity) and so type II supernovae are not all equally bright. The other types also have precursors which vary in size or other factors, only type 1a supernovae are thought to always have a white dwarf of mass 1.39 as a standard precursor, so only type 1a are suitable as a standard candle. 

The star SAO 158687, also cataloged as HD 128598 is a magnitude 8.7, orange dwarf star in Libra. There seems to be nothing special about the star, except that one day, a planet passed in front of it. 

(from a question on physics se The sun produces relatively little UV radiation, most of its light is visible, or infrared, and anything shorter than about 290nm is completely blocked by the atmosphere (remember to thank the atmosphere today) UVa (in the range 400-320) and UVb (320-290nm) do get through. The sun is so very bright, that it is by far the brightest natural source of UV on the Earth. The moon is about 400,000 times dimmer than the sun. Ultraviolet reflected off the moon could reach the Earth. It would be very dim. At night UV camera systems use active illumination rather than depending on the moon. 

Galactic orbits are not Keplerian: There is not a single massive centre, whose gravity attracts the sun, rather the whole disc, and dark matter halo which surrounds the galaxy. We can't use the inverse square law to calculate the force of gravity without knowing the distribution of mass in the galaxy. Nevertheless, the Sun's orbit is roughly circular, so we can use kinematics to get some idea of the forces involved: For circular motion $a=\frac{v^2}{r}$. The velocity of the sun is about 225000 m/s, and we are at a radius of about 2.5e20 m from the centre. The formula above gives a very small centripetal acceleration of 2e-10 m/sÂ² However the sun is quite massive, 2e30 kg, so using $F=ma$, the force on the sun is of the order 4e20 N. This is about 0.01 of the force acting on the Earth by the Sun. (3.6e22 N) 

Mutual eclipses and occulations of Jupiter's moons occur during Jovian Equinox, twice in each orbit of Jupiter, and so roughly every 6 years. The last series of events was in 2015, so the next will start in 2021. There will be a series of events between January and August. The site $URL$ can generate ephemerides for these events. 

The process by which stars convert hydrogen to helium isn't burning; it is the fusion of the nuclei of atoms. To get nuclei to fuse you need to confine them in a very small space and get them very hot. On Earth we can make things very hot, and we can put things under lots of pressure. The trouble is that we can't do both at the same time. The usual way we put things under pressure is squeezing them in some sort of vice. But if the thing we are squeezing is many millions of degrees, it will just vapourize our equipment. If we heat up some hydrogen, it expands and we don't get the confinement required for sustained fusion. (But this is how a thermonuclear bomb works) Now a star is a huge ball of gas. The weight of the gas compresses the inner core of the star to an enormous pressure and traps the heat. A litre of the sun's core would weigh about 150kg at a pressure of about 250 billion atmospheres, and have a temperature of 15million degrees. This combination of temperature and pressure cannot be achieved on Earth. The hydrogen in the sun's core is confined by its own gravity. Back on Earth we are trying to confine hydrogen with magnetic fields. (See the ITER Tokamak) With this system we will be able to start fusion, but the amount of energy we get out is less than the energy we put in. However solving this problem is merely a technical challenge. If we can work out how to use magnetic fields to confine hydrogen at very high temperatures we will be able to generate power from fusion. 

Main sequence stars that are small, have relatively low rates of hydrogen fusion, and cool exteriors. These are called "red dwarfs" and account for the majority of stars. All red dwarfs are too dim to be visible with the naked eye, but the closest star, Proxima centuri, is an example. Stars near the end of their life swell up, and the outer layers cool and become cool and red. Very massive stars like Betelgeuse have a similar colour to red dwarfs but are much larger. Betelgeuse is a Red Giant; it is not on the Main Sequence. 

This histogram of time of impact of about 250 fireballs since 2007 shows no particular decrease around midday. The documentary graphics may show an apparently fully lit earth, and a perpendicular impact as it is easier to recognise the Day side of the Earth, and it looks more dramatic. 

As a star collapses, there is a massive release of energy. A supernova releases $10^{44}$ Joules, equivalent to a mass of $10^{27}kg$ which is a lot. But compared to the mass of the sun ($2\times10^{30}$kg) it is not so much: 0.0005 solar masses. So there is a change in the gravitational field, but this is not the cause or a major contribution to the supernova. The field doesn't change "in an instant" Most of the energy is carried away by neutrinos at just under the speed of light, and changes to the gravitational fields propagate at the speed of light (there is some gravitational radiation emitted too) Supernovae are powered principally by the release of gravitational potential energy as the core falls in on itself. The explosion we see is only a small fraction of the energy released, most is in the form of neutrinos. Supernovae are so ridiculously energetic that you can't trust your intuition, but computer models are becoming better at predicting the dynamics 

Since the very early solar system, there have not been large-scale movements of the planets. In the early solar system, while the planets were still embedded in a protoplanetary disk, there were large movements. (notably the hypothesised "Grand Tack" of Jupiter) However once Jupiter reached it's current position of 5.2AU it remained there, and the Earth formed then too. There have not been any significant changes to the Earth's orbit since the Earth formed, otherwise there would have been significant heating or cooling. So the average year length was and is about 30 000 000 seconds, and Earth has made about 4.5 billion orbits of the sun since then.
