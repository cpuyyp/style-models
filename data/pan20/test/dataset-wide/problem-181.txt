What you're describing seems closest to what D&D (and many other created worlds) refer to as sorcery which is a force that comes from within and is created by willpower (or in this case emotion). I would recommend looking at something like that. Sorcery might not be the correct name for your emotional magic however, as it sounds more like bewitchment or enchanting (the spells on people kind) because it feeds off emotions. You could even call it something as cliche as wizardry because that wouldn't necessarily box you into a corner and as you've already decided to create your own magic system wizardry (or similar) could be defined to mean anything you want. One final alternative would be to make up a word or series of words to represent this form of magic. Best of luck 

If a non-physical answer is acceptable, then I think you could use religion and ideology as a way of keeping the populace on the ground. From your description this isn't what you're looking for, mostly because the civilisation you have seems very advanced (they're investigating space flight). However, if this religion was fairly new, say it arose with the advent of modern technology, then it could provide a reason for not ever building spaceships in the first place. That said, I think the best bet for a physical limitation is one that's already been proposed: a very stormy planet. 

What kind of detail do you need, and what sort of tools do you plan on using? I've made many faux-topological maps for tabletop campaigns and the like. The procedure is rather simple, depending on how "accurate" you want the map to be. The simplest system I've found is to draw out a plain version of your map; post points of interest (cities, wells, police stations, demon portals, whwever) and draw any lakes you plan on having. If a point of interest requires a river, draw a blue dot where the river should flow. Next, figure out the highest points on your map; mountain peaks or hills. Draw a dot for peaks or a circle for hilltops. Then you step up from lakes and down from hilltops. Visualize the land around these features and draw the first ring of the topographic map. In you're making it all up, add a little squiggle variety at random. It's an iterative process; you're building UP land from lakes and DOWN land from hilltops and mountain tops. There will come a point where you've filled in all the gaps between hills and lakes; you then draw rivers following the contour lines you've made But I already have a map and I want to use a computer! OK; if your map has a gradient of color or tone from mountain top to valley showing the altitude, it's pretty easy. Use the "Posterize" tool to reduce the number of colors and tones on you map to some reduced number, depending on the number of countours you want on your map. If you want 16 countour lines from mountain peak to lowest point, posterize to 16 colors. The map will be decomposed to 16 swatches, and your contour lines should be drawn on the boundaries between colors. 

Fire is incredibly useful. As humans we've invented too many uses to count. However a few of the highlights include: climate control, cooking, sanitization, metalworking, protection, warfare, transportation and combustion engines. There are workarounds for some of these such as using electricity to cook, fuse metals together, or using radiation to sanitize. Not having fire means that if you want an advanced society you need to have a different path through history. The main reason is that early advancements like firing clay, basic copper and bronze tools, and the invention of better ceramics for transporting and preserving goods require heat. Without the ability to use fire, your society must use some other heat source. Cooking, metalworking, firing clay, and things of that nature don't require fire specifically, they require heat. It just happens to be that fire was the most readily available form of heat to humans. Another barrier to advanced civilizations is that to get the ability to automate things using computers, wiring, and even basic electricity you need a source of heat. Without it there's no way to reach advanced technology. However, all is not lost. Fire might be the simplest, cheapest, most readily available source of heat here on earth, but on a world of gas that would probably be chemical reactions. Exothermic chemical reactions release heat and there are lots of sources for them. Throwing combustion aside for now, neutralization is probably the easiest. This is the reaction that occurs between an acid and a base. Using strong acids and bases you can achieve a portable heat source all you have to do is mix them together and poof heat. Another workaround for creating a lot of heat (enough for metalworking and everything else) is a thermite reaction using iron oxide and aluminum you can get temperatures of up to 2500 °C (iron's melting point is 1538 °C). Thermite does require some heat to get it up to its reaction temperature but using other chemical reactions you could achieve this. 

Why would a scheming, greedy, profits-driven opportunist ever educate their children? Education costs money and resources and risk revolution; much better to impress a basic trade skill on your children and lock them into indentured servitude to the family. (The Ferengi have been mentioned to do something like this). You want your slaves to be just intelligent enough to speak and do their menial tasks, but not so intelligent that they have second thoughts about their rightful place in the grand scheme of things (in a dingy factory, pulling levers). Children would be born prolifically, probably in vats or some other bulk-production system, as the only employees these merchantilists* would have full control over, for their entire lives, are family members. So, to answer the question directly: The Volto educate their children by brutal example (natural selection). Many of their children will just make the best out of it that they can, learning quickly that pulling the lever faster gets one some minor increase in benefits (closer to an air vent, or a less-squeaky lever). Strong arming other workers into pulling their levers faster gets one a promotion to Supervisor and a plasma whip. They'll naturally learn to use their brute force to take what they need. Supervisors who don't punish their crews enough will be demoted back into ranks, where the next Supervisor will literally whip them into shape. Supervisors who are too brutal will decrease the productivity of their crew, and likely be terminated. The harsh (plasma pistol) firing will serve as a lesson to other Supervisors. And some of those children, maybe one out of every vat-load, will be born with extra intelligence. When a Volto parent discovers one of their children organizing the other children into working for them (think Tom Sawyer, not labor union type organization), they pull that kid out of the mines and move him or her into Management (before they damage the Prole worldview too much). The ability to manipulate their fellows without force, but with the invisible hand of economic theory would be taught to them, on the job. They'll learn, or they'll go back to the mines, and their bretheren will be all too happy to get their hands on the "suit" who reduced their water rations to save on repair parts for the water pumps. This, in fact, will be the biggest weapon used by the Management class against their own staff: do what I tell you to do or you go back to the mines to die at the hands of the Proles. Life in Management is a swift learning experience because your life is one check-mark on a form away from ending brutally at the hands of your oppressed under-family. One will learn how to manipulate their fellows, wring every drop of profit out of their under-family, and backstab each other to gain rank or cover their butts. Only the most backstabby, vile members of the family will survive to be a Parent, the C-levels of society. Many will fail back into the mines as scapegoats or victims of purges, some will settle in the middle ranks as a headcount, doing just enough to keep their berth and having so little motivation for upward advancement that their supervisors never have to kill them off for safety. And those with the best biological makeup to be the scum of the scum will be the only members with enough pull to make it to the C-Level and become part of the next vat's gene pool, thereby building those features in to their family's DNA. Proles mate with Proles to fill out the working class, and C-levels mate with C-levels to increase the efficiency of the Management class. (* Many writers make the mistake of having uber-evil Capitalists, but that falls apart, as many features of Capitalism run contrary to the very overbearing, backwards minded concepts of these societies. For an example, take Star Trek: DS9. The Ferengi didn't even let their females wear clothing, and consigned them to the house, thereby pre-emptively shutting down half of the workforce (and half of the available market for goods! Women not buying clothing?! I couldn't not buy shoes!) A whole season's worth of Quark episodes surrounded the Ferengi Grand Nagus turning into a banking and industry genius, only for Quark to find out that his mother was the actual intelligence behind the throne! All those middle managers, marketing executives, and (yes) shuttle mechanics being forcefully excluded from the market? That's not Capitalism! That's more like Mercantilism. Keep your resources internal. Exploit your workers to the bone. Refuse imports, focus on exports. Your aliens are more Mercantillist than Capitalist. Just a little detail to write in.) 

If for some reason a creature didn't need depth perception, or had some other means of perceiving depth then a cyclops doesn't seem impossible. If a large creature from the ocean transitioned to being a land creature and was able to continue using either echolocation (not too likely) or electroreception then a cyclops wouldn't be to far outside the realm of possibility. Another possibility is that the creature doesn't need sight, if it was more of an earthworm, or a mole like species and had only a single eye and has recently moved above ground. Yet another way this could have evolved is if the creature were largely stationary, depth perception wouldn't be as important to such a species of beings. 

Fish have your answer: the lateral line. Its a sensory organ that runs the length of the fish's body. The lateral line allows fish to sense movement and vibration in water. If you adapt this a small amount you could easily allow for it to work in very thick gasses. The cells on the lateral line have sometimes mutated to allow for electroreception, which is something you should really look into. Electroreception allows for electrocommunication and electrolocation. Which seem to be what you're looking for. 

The Ozone layer protects us from UVB radiation, which is the point of this question. The big difficulty in answering this question is summed up by a 2007 study by the University of Ottawa to the US Department of Health and Human Services: there's not enough information to determine a safe level of sun exposure that imposes minimal risk of skin cancer. (Abstract Additionally, there's no conclusive evidence that UVB is actually carcinogenic; we label the whole spectrum as "carcinogenic." We're relatively certain that they are all carcinogens, but we don't know for sure (Paper) This makes it hard to put a number to the amount of Ozone needed. Human skin color correlates well with the UV radiation available to a group of people over long time scales; Peoples around the equator tend to have higher pigmentation levels; in the rainforest they have middle range pigmentation, and near the poles a lack of significant pigmentation. For "human survival" it would depend on the length of time available for the colony to become adapted to the UV, perhaps over the course of many, many generations. One thing to remember is that UV is not ionizing radiation. It doesn't chew through the length of the body, knocking bits around. UV causes damage to surfaces through chemical interactions; the skin and eyes would be vulnerable. Another missing detail in the question: are human like species expected to evolve on this planet, or are we talking about a human colony landing? If it's a human colony landing, the answer is "Zero Ozone." Simple fact of the matter is, because UV only damages surfaces, you can have UV filtering goggles and clothing that reflects UV covering all skin surfaces, and you are fine. This depends on humans evolving elsewhere and arriving on the planet with no ozone, but it's surviviable. This would also allow the humans to use construction materials to build domes and filters for food crops which would be damaged by high levels of UV. If you want life to evolve on this planet into human like critters, that's a vastly different story. UV isn't ionizing, so it doesn't plow through structures; but it's powerful enough to punch right through single celled organisms, and we kinda need those for life to evolve. I've failed to find information about the UV absorption of sea water, but life finds a way, right? So it'd probably start at the deep sea vents, scaled critters could come up to higher levels in the ocean because the scales protect their skin, which would allow them to leave the oceans for the land, and evolve into feathered and hairy beings. But then we get to a problem; it's believed that humans evolved hairlessness because our environment and new bipedal posture made wearing fur cause problems with cooling the body; we shed the fur so we could sweat more efficiently. On a high UV planet, however, it's likely that human type critters wouldn't be able to lose their fur, or would have to replace it with something else. But this whole line of thought, while fun to follow, is moot. High powered mobile animals like us require oxygen as part of our respiration cycle. The Ozone layer is moderated by the incoming Ozone itself; higher levels of Ozone react with the Oxygen in the atmosphere to create new O3; that O3 gets knocked apart by UV which forms more O2 or more O3. It's a self-regenerating process. So any planet with enough oxygen to support animals will likely have an ozone layer adequate to control the majority of harmful UV radiation. The concern with the ozone hole was the fear that we humans were emitting chemistry in the air which destroyed O3 faster than UV radiation could create it, disrupting the balance and allowing through more radiation. This is unlikely to be a problem on a pre-industrial world, and post-industrial societies have plenty of methods available to reduce one's exposure to high UV radiation, and to protect their pets, livestock, and crops. TL;DR: the answer is "Zero" To have humans who look like us, we need an Ozone layer similar to the one on Earth; the lack of ozone wouldn't destroy the ability for life to evolve, but it would cause it to follow a completely different path, and therefore would not be a "human society." Humans landing on the planet will be able to shield themselves from the increased UV simply; the only technology required is the ability to make cloth and UV filtering glass, which any space-based society should be able to produce.
