Your premises contain the answer to the question: yes, if there were two of you, there would be two of you. One of you would experience things in one location, and the other one would experience things in the other. If the surroundings (and stochastic noise) were not identical, the two would begin to diverge; if they were, there would be two yous having two identical experiences. That is, each would experience their own consciousness. But this is not at all problematic. There are lots of people who have their own experiences. That two of them happen to be identical would be weird, but there's nothing deeply perplexing here. You don't see out of other people's eyes whether or not those people are built exactly the same way as you. If you drop the premise that you are emergent from the atoms that compose you, then, well, any answer is possible, isn't it? One could suppose that this would be an experimental test of emergent consciousness, except you can't actually do the experiment, so it's kind of a moot point. 

Do you simply mean, given that we accept that our own mind is the product of physical processes occurring in our brain, we should also accept that other people have minds much like ours (since they have brains much like ours)? If that is what you are trying to ask, the answer is a resounding yes. You cannot credibly deny the existence of other minds while accepting the physical basis of your own. (You ought not believe the evidence for physicality if you reject that other minds exist.) If, in contrast, you're asking whether we can simply assume that others' minds' cognitive narrative causes their actions, given that it seems that way to ourselves, the answer is a resounding no. And the reason is not any trouble with bridging the first-person third-person gap; it is that we cannot be too sure that our own conscious thoughts and decisions are causally necessary! Under certain circumstances, one can predict a "free choice" made by someone seconds in advance of when they make it or are aware of it; there's a decent Wikipedia article summarizing some of the findings. So the answer seems to be it's complicated, and I expect that this cannot be disentangled by philosophy alone; we also need cognitive science and/or neuroscience to shed more light on what is really going on. 

All of these conclusions are moral statements that follow logically from facts, plus an understanding of what the purpose of morality is. If you don't know what the purpose of morality is, or if you successfully argue that there is no purpose to morality, then you're stuck, because you're eternally vulnerable to the "well, I don't feel that way" type of argument. (Note that there is not universal agreement about what the purpose of morality is, or whether there is any purpose.) 

The naturalistic answer--that is, the answer that you implicitly accept when performing scientific research--is yes. The reasoning is pretty simple: all nontrivial computational devices are (when abstracted to devices with the ability to access infinite memory) equivalent, and everything in the physical universe is in principle describable mathematically (i.e. as a computation). Even quantum mechanics admits computations which are arbitrarily close. We've no evidence that this picture (of reality being comprehensible/calculable) is wrong, and a vast and ever-growing pile of instances where it seems to work. As parts of the universe, we therefore are presumably inherently calculable. Since there's no difference in principle (just in implementation detail) between artificially intelligent machines and naturally intelligent humans, AIs can in principle do anything we can, including be sentient. Whether there will ever be AIs that meet the preconditions to be sentient (whatever those are) we don't know. But we do have a pretty good idea now that there's no more magic behind cognition (including sentience, presumably) than there is magical vital force behind life. 

There are problems with even trying to ask the question. We form our ideas of causes and antecedent conditions from the flow of time in the normal universe. It's not terribly hard to envision cause-free structures (like a random graph), or structures where it is hard to find an analog of causality. So if you get too meta with the question, you first need to justify that the question makes sense even in principle. But if we back off a bit and say, "That we exist is dependent on the fine-tuning of a zillion parameters, but we won't worry about the general form of physical laws, just various constants we can tweak," then it's not at all clear that fine-tuning tells us anything. Firstly, if you presuppose that the universe must have created humans, of course there are a baffling number of incredibly rare events that must have happened. But if you don't, then given that we can't simulate from first principles an entire universe with different constants, we don't really know that e.g. it's really surprising that our universe supports life. Certainly you can't tweak the fine-structure constant too much before we couldn't survive, but some equivalently complex and aware creature might have been fairly likely. Secondly, it's possible that a lot of the fundamental constants aren't actually constants but the result of mathematics that we don't understand. We wouldn't say, "What if the universe hadn't had Pi be 3.14159...", because that constant is not a free choice but rather a consequence of Euclidean geometry (which arises in all sorts of contexts). Likewise, I don't think we can tell that things like the electron rest mass and the speed of light are really free to vary independent of everything else. Thirdly, even if we are surprised by the universe we find ourselves in, it doesn't assure us that a God exists. It depends on the priors, which is sort of assuming that there can at least conceptually be a multiverse of possible universes, some created by God and some not, and our task is to figure out how many of each sort there are, and then see if we can use signatures within those universes to figure out which kind we're in. So, actually, I don't think the fine-tuning argument in favor of God makes sense at all without postulating at least a conceptual multiverse; and once we do that, we have to ask what our priors are on God-created vs. uncreated universes. If we think God-created universes are sufficiently unlikely (at least with the characteristics we observe in ours), then the surprise we feel regarding how tuned ours seems to be to admit our existence may not be enough to override our doubts that God-created universes are common from among the conceptual set (however you measure that, if you even can). Finally, note that "God" just means any entity capable of universe-creation. The arguments apply equally well to religious ideas of God and to any sort of we-live-in-a-simluation scenario (where God is either the simuluating computational engine, or the entity/ies who created it). 

In particular, you can't just look at Joe's reaction before he knows what Peter's reasons are. Edit: had the outer implication backwards. 

It is logically possible that you can in fact calculate that fast but you need the ritual of submitting the problem to a computer in order to be able to consciously access the answer. You can take this to ridiculous extremes by having mathematics formulas generated from block-codes from Bitcoin mining, with the calculation done without you observing, and only then you getting to check that the answer agrees with your longhand result. (I.e. you are either doing the entire world's bitcoin mining operations in your head, or your perceptions are not stable in that the answer changes between when you first read it and when you re-calculate and see if it's a match.) However, empirically it suggests that (at least metaphysical) solipsism is a non-functional model of the world and should be abandoned. There are many other actual and thought-experiments which suggest the same. (E.g. falling in love with someone who is not interested in you.) 

Systems of ethics that address intergenerational issues should provide guidance on how to balance the interests of those people nearing the end of their lives, those just beginning, and those in between, and also on how to balance the interests of those people alive now and those who will be in the future (if those who are alive now don't mess things up too badly). What are the current schools of thought on these issues? (Or, if giving a summary is difficult, where is a good place to learn about current thought on these issues?) (Note that while this has always been an important part of ethics, it is particularly critical now that we are able to affect our environment in such dramatic ways; in previous centuries, the answer "act morally now, and the future will sort itself out" would sound plausible. This century, however, that sounds far too naive.) 

Proposition 1 is generally regarded as true, and proposition 2 is probably (depending on what you mean) equivalent to saying that physicists are actually using math, as opposed to something else, even if they take some shortcuts and don't define everything. But I don't think it's a given that the formalisms will form a self-consistent whole. It would be nice if they could, and it's certainly worth trying, but I don't see a priori why it should be possible to have formalisms developed in different areas be fully consistent with each other, except in the trivial way where they basically become lookup tables telling you what happened in each case. And anyway, self-consistency doesn't imply consistency with the natural world. Proposition 4 is almost certainly wrong: a true theory could still be falsifiable (e.g. in thought experiments) without being fasified if it is a true theory. (Also, that it is a true theory is a separate proposition; it doesn't follow automatically from earlier propositions.). Proposition 5 seems straightforward enough; even if it's all tautologies, we don't necessarily know them. Proposition 6 also seems to be wrong--what about developing things on practical grounds because we want to make better iPads and download videos from YouTube faster? 

If you interact with people anywhere else on the planet, knowing the basic configuration of the earth and the sun makes it much easier to understand time zones, different seasons in the northern and southern hemisphere, and so on. If you care at all about weather and live outside the tropics, it's a helpful organizing principle to understand the progression of seasons. It lets you realize that a day is the same duration whether or not it's summer or winter. You could just memorize hundreds of isolated facts (and you probably will anyway), but why not learn an organizing principle--of how the thing actually works--in order to make sense of it? More generally, one may want to learn things for physically practical reasons, or for socially practical reasons, or for personal development even if directly impractical. Basically all of what is taught, as far as I am aware, falls into one of these categories, or at least attempts to. Poor teaching may fail to achieve any of these ends (or may succeed but without you noticing that there was something practical in there), but that's a different issue. One may also research or investigate things not known to be practical, but that's another different issue. 

As a consequentialist, I'm sure you can construct a scenario where removing a memory is the right thing to do. For example, if someone is going to go on a shooting spree because they caught their girlfriend with another man, removing the memory of the indiscretion is probably better at maximizing whatever value-function you have. With other frameworks, it may or may not be permitted. I doubt it would be easy to will the universal law, "A person X should be able to remove the memory of person Y if X believes it would be better for Y to not have that memory", so it probably fails the Categorical Imperative. It also probably violates intuitive morality, as people seem to value self-determination pretty highly. To get an idea of what a particular framework might think about it, I suggest you look at their arguments about lying (including white lies). Similar reasoning would seem to apply in this case: in each case your actions replaces an accurate perception in someone else with an inaccurate one. There are difficult issues regarding lying in dire situations; suggesting that this is like lying is not to say that there is an obvious answer to the morality of memory alteration. 

I am not aware of canonical answers, but a few strong ones spring to mind (Springer's comments not among them): (1) If we have any obligation to future generations at all, making them non-existent is, if we are wrong that we should do so, the biggest and most permanent mistake that it is possible to make. Things would have to be so radically different from how they are now in order for us to be adequately convinced that ending humanity was the right thing to do, that we cannot reason about it. For the foreseeable future, the risk of making an unrecoverable mistake is unacceptably high. (2) We, along with other living organisms, are built (by evolutionary processes) to create and safeguard future generations. That we exist at all is because of this; that we have morality at all (or goals and desires at all) is because of this. Intentionally terminating our existence means that we are fundamentally broken, and robs us of any sort of justification for using our goals and desires to guide our actions. (3) Our ancestors didn't create us so that we could party to extinction. We cannot repay them except by creating another generation, so we are obligated to create another generation. The last one only applies to partying--if we're all in agony and wished that our ancestors had not created us, then we have no obligation to return their favor. The first two apply regardless of how pleasant or unpleasant we find our situation. 

I can't see that using language this way would be particularly helpful. (As an aside, there are plenty of highly reflective atheists, so take care not to muddle issues of faith with issues of reflection.) Edit: I didn't actually say how an atheist would do these things because it's not any different from how anyone would do these things (apart from e.g. praying and Bible study). To get knowledge, study; to get insight, try to discern and test causes and effects; to get judgment, note carefully the consequences of different actions. Reading great literature, or about current events or history will give you plenty of material from which to glean insight and judgment. 

Virtue ethics are not proposed as a solution to defining what is good. Rather, it is in contrast to, for example, (direct) utilitarian ethics where it doesn't matter what virtue you may or may not be following; all that matters is outcome. Virtue ethics spares you from considering all eventualities, and instead says: it is good to act like so, even if things don't always turn out the way you'd hope. Both virtue- and consequence-based systems have problems in objectively defining what is a good virtue or good consequence (and how to measure it, if needed).
