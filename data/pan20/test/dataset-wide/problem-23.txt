Is the library "anyone"? If so, it can learn spells. A lot of spells. Do not mess with a sentient library. Especially, do not mess with a sentient library that has a sense of humor. On the most basic level: Dispel magic until there is no more magic detected and then Baleful Polymorph bad actors into bats or something else that eats moths. If you want to be kind, give the bats unique markings and then list them in a log book. That way the librarians can question them and, maybe, end their sentence. If polymorph doesn't work, disintegrate after disintegrate will solve the problem. I few gust of winds will clean that man right out of my stacks. 

Here is an article on quantum communications that should fit the bill. China is putting up a satellite to test it soon. The message isn't sent using quantum entanglement (we aren't there yet) but the decryption key is. 

As @akaioi said. Also, high air pressure would allow more moisture to be held by the air without precipitating. So if the world had higher air pressure the humidity in the desert (while still being low compared to other places on that world) would still be high from an Earth point of view. On world with Earth like air pressure, maybe the terrain is arranged in a V to concentrate the air pressure in an area. You might get a high humidity desert in the tip of the V but the water would then condense out as the air moved up the mountains which would cause rivers to head down to your desert. That might ruin the whole "dry" thing you are going for unless terrain also routed those rivers away from the desert area. EDIT: Vylix pointed out that I was unclear so: By "V" shaped, I mean two mountain ranges coming to a point with prevailing winds running between them to the point. This would create a localized high pressure area. The mountains have to be low enough that the air can spill over them but high enough that it causes enough air to "bunch up" in the V. 

If conditions are such that it takes more than two to guard or feed the young, having more than two "parents" with an actual stake in the outcome (by sharing DNA) could do it. In a very fluid environment, having multiple choices of DNA (from multiple parents) could increase the randomization of the offspring. If the young are produced in litters, it would make it more likely that some would have what it takes to survive the conditions they find themselves in. 

1) As Mormacil said, it doesn't need a visible form for the connection to form. If it operates by voice, studies have shown that both men and women tend to respond better to female voices. Though there will always be exceptions. 3) There will always be a spectrum of reactions. However, given how lazy some sheeple (sheep/people) can be, there will be a growing fraction that does let the PAI do their thinking for them. Thus, hacked PAIs could be used to win elections and in extreme cases lead to users injury or death (look at accidents caused by drivers following gps directions to roads that don't exist). 

If you want to head into the fantasy side of things, the Fae worlds are generally considered to be running at different time rates. I see nothing wrong with different universes having different rates of time. None of them would know unless someone were to travel from one to the other and back. To have any kind of "parallel" universe, the difference in time rate would be very small. After all being 1000 years ahead or behind is a very small fraction of 13B years. The time rate differences would probably not be noticeable (or even measurable) over short periods. If the time rate difference was something noticeable (like 2x), you would have a case where the Sun had long ago gone nova or, in the other direction, the Sun may be condensing our of interstellar gas. 

Rabbit's suggestion of inside the skull is good, another possibility would be in the chest cavity. It could be inserted with a thick needle and the surgery to remove it is actually more difficult than opening the skull (if you don't get into the brain itself). You have to cut through muscle and bone and avoid a bunch of blood vessels that you really don't want to mess with if you don't know what you are doing. 

It seems to me that you are describing the Federation from the early seasons of Star Trek: Next Generation. Watch the first three seasons. (this was before enough people pointed out that the society they described would not work) Edited for more detail: The first few seasons of TNG were a bit preachy. There was no money (they thought the concept outdated) and everyone did jobs that best fit their interests. This was Roddenberry's Marxist Utopia. The trouble is that it wouldn't work. Without money, how do you trade for stuff? Granted, with replicators, the only thing you need is energy. If energy is free, that works. The trouble is, they show trade between civilizations. How does that work? Revert to barter? Also, everyone does their jobs because they interest them? Given human nature, now may people would choose to stay home and play computer games? It would take some pretty heavy brain washing to overcome that. The other thing that the Federation has is a standing army (Star Fleet). They are "science" vessels that are loaded with defenses and weapons. Look at emulating Star Fleet for your military. 

For use in a vacuum. The gun strips hydrogen atoms and accelerates the electrons one way on a ring magnet and the protons in the other direction (not in the same path but using as much of the same hardware as possible). It then discharges both beams in succession (electrons, then protons). This idea comes from reading George O. Smith's The Complete Venus Equilateral (one of my favorite SF books). In the story he pointed out several problems with using an electron beam as a weapon. 

Lets start with the Octopus. As has been mentioned, it has neural clusters in it's tentacles that let them operate independently. Then we have a long necked creature that sends its head in to directly eat the prey instead of relying on suction cups to pull the prey out. One drawback is that while its head is neck deep into a crevasse, it cannot see predators sneaking up on it. So, a mutation with an extra undeveloped head would be good for keeping watch and biting attackers while it extracts its main head. This only becomes really useful if the two brains communicate. Otherwise, mini head wants to run away while feeding head is twisted around in the crevasse, anchoring it in position. So, mini head slowly becomes more dominant (not being eaten has more survival value than eating). Another mutation leads to another eating head. Twice the chance of getting food. This requires more coordination. The neural cluster that coordinates activity between the heads gets more complex. Eventually, most "thinking" happens in the neural cluster that connects everything. Other heads may appear due to the same mutation until some optimal number if heads is achieved (which may be different for different species). At this point, the "main head" may lose it's dominance to the central cluster that connects the heads. In different species, the heads may specialize. 

As has been pointed out, there is probably plenty of solid matter in a gas giant. The trouble is that it is an insignificant portion of its mass. So, you would have to blow away the gas without blowing away the bits you want to keep. This will be difficult depending on how much circulation there is in the deep regions of the planet. The interior is generally hot enough that "solid" matter will likely be melted into a liquid or boiled into a gas. If you are lucky enough to have low circulation, the solid bits may have clumped into the center but if the circulation is high enough, the solid matter will mix with the rest and you will have a filtering job. Though if you strip off the outer layers, you can probably get the solid bits to condense out once the pressure has dropped. The big question though is: why? We have lots of solid bits that we can get to that don't take nearly that much work: planets, moons, asteroids, oort cloud. 

Long range missile slugging match: Throw out as many missiles as you can as fast as you can since any ship you eliminate is one less ship firing on you and less defensive firepower. The side that runs out of ships, assault missiles or defensive missiles first loses. Variations revolve around different mixes of offensive and defensive output and a decision between mass devoted to launchers vs mass devoted to missile storage. Turtle with a knife: Have enough speed, defensive firepower, armor and shields (if they are a thing in your universe) to wade through the missile storm to get into knife fighting range. Combination fleet: A usually non-optimal combination of the two. 

There is no reason the leader has to be a despot. There can be benevolent dictators. The trouble there is that the benevolent dictator is usually not ruthless enough with those under him/her and gets deposed. By having the absolute loyalty of the zombies, you can afford to be kind. 

As have been mentioned by @Murphey and @Twelth, war can be a relief of boredom and they will be very good at it. As other people have mentioned, I can't believe that they would form a battle line and go numbers to numbers against a foe. They would use all of their skill that they've developed. Also, there might only be one or two in a battle. They run in from a sideline and kill a bunch and then leave. Or they sit back and pick off people with a bow. You might have one each on both sides of the battle in a contest with each other. They wouldn't fight each other but would be keeping score. To make things interesting, they might put restrictions on themselves like: only arrows through the left eye count. They would make awesome: scouts, assassins, and generals. Imagine two immortals playing chess with real people. Heck, they are probably playing Settlers of Cattan or Risk with nations. Then, when they get bored, they join a fight and put enough restrictions on themselves to make it interesting. 

I've seen the term "Surface Scan" used fairly frequently. This is opposed to a "deep scan" or "deep probe." If you want to be a bit unique, you could call it "skimming." 

I've been thinking about a Moon base for a long time. For sustainable living, non-woody plants like vines and other typically ground cover will do well there. They will not need to be as stiff to support themselves. For O2 generation, the higher the percentage of green on the plant the better. Pick plants and grasses that have edible leaves and stems. That gives you air and food. You can also use their roots to process some of the waste. For meat, goats are the best bet. They have a greater percentage of usable parts per mass (and food consumption) than other animals (milk, leather, meat). I can't find the article that discusses goats but here is a NASA article that discusses the best plants. BTW, the search "space goats" left me sad for humanity. Stairs would be less useful unless people's muscle mass seriously decreased. I suspect that ramps would be used more or modified ladders (where no loads need to be carried by people). The only things that would be more difficult would be things that use gravity for assistance. Drilling into the ground would require that the drill be either 6x as heavy or bolted to the ground. Swinging a hammer would be less useful also since you would either need to anchor yourself to apply as much force as you are use to using on Earth. People will likely walk normally but running will require a bit more headroom. People will not have to do the "bunny hop" due to the low gravity. Our Apollo astronauts did that because the pressurized suits had joints that were hard to bend. So it was easier to hop than bend the knee and hip joints. 

Demons use swarm tactics While air power would allow the angels to kill/wound demons with impunity, all they can really do is thin the ranks (or take out high value targets). The demons simply have to throw out enough troops to reach the goal using swarm tactics. It is like sending 100 people armed with fly swatters to stop a locust swarm. They need to have some angels on the ground to stop the leakers or to bottle them up so the flyers can take out larger populations of demons. The bombs are much more effective if the demons can be bunched up. The demons have ranged weapons There is no cover in the sky. If the demons can shoot at you while you shoot at them, then you might want ground cover. Note that flyers can almost always attack from outside the range of ground troops but their accuracy will get pretty terrible. If the demon swarm isn't all bunched up, inaccurate air fire will be basically worthless. 

First, definitions. Currency is not backed by hard goods, money is. Currency has a value independent of anything but the perceived ability of the issuer to provide value to the holder of the note. In other words, the value of currency is just what everyone agrees it is. It is a lie that we choose to believe because it is convenient. Money is a coin made from hard assets or a note/token backed by hard assets; typically, gold or silver but there are exceptions. The sheckle was traditionally a wooden token given the value of 1 bushel of grain. A farmer could give his grain to the city and get a sheckle for every bushel. Then he could pay people with those sheckles and the people paid could use that to either buy other things or to withdraw a bushel of grain to make bread. The city would create as many sheckles as it needed but only hand out as many as they had grain. Note that these cities also used metal money for bigger purchases so sheckles were only used by the poor classes. Could the city distribute more sheckles than they had grain? Sure but the value was so low that it wasn't worth getting caught. Cities were much more likely to shave gold off of their coins. I think that the ancient sheckle is a good match for what you want to do.
