This answer will assume that the huge solar storm sought by the OP can be obtained through natural processes. The most probable candidate for giant solar storms are coronal mass ejections. 

Reasonable perhaps but completely unnecessary. Let's forget all this modern twaddle about trying to justify the existence of vampires and possible biological mechanisms for how they function and manifest themselves. Steer clear of viral agents being responsible for vampirism. It's time to go to basics. Vampires are supernatural monsters pure and simple. They are undead. They're already dead. presumably then it is some supernatural force makes them mobile, active, and able to harm the living. The drinking blood business simply comes with territory. Like being allergic garlic, holy water, not reflecting in mirrors (now just try and explain that scientifically, you smart scientifically minded and obsessed kiddy-winkies), and being unable to bear the sight of the Cross. Plus having stakes driven through your heart. Supernatural forces always work their own perverse, irrational logic. Otherwise what would be the point of them being supernatural forces. Next thing they could be explained scientifically if they weren't. Presumably the fanging of victims and ingesting their blood might have something with vital spirits or forces, but that a hopelessly outmoded and discredited concept from old-fashioned, pre-modern bad science. Therefore, it could be perfectly in keeping with the operation of supernatural forces and powers. Let's face with vampires are not only dead, they're most definitely undead. This means there is absolutely no way that mixing blood types or being restricted to specific blood groups makes any sense at all. Why? because they're already dead. They can't be harmed by ingestion of the wrong blood (if that means anything in this context) which is one of the advantages of being dead. In conclusion, there is absolutely no reason why vampires, supernatural vampires that is, should be restricted in the blood groups of the blood they imbibe and ingest. They are above and beyond any normal physiological or biological functions

There are, of course, resources such as the following books: -- Solar Sails: A Novel Approach to Interplanetary Travel, Gregory Matloff, Les Johnson and Dr. Giovanni Vulpetti, Springer/Praxis Books, 2008. Starsailing: solar sails and interstellar travel, Louis Friedman. John Wiley & Sons, 1988.

Centauri Dreams: Imagining and Planning Interstellar Exploration, Paul Gilster. Copernicus Books, 2004. Like Matloff and Mallove (1989) above, this work has chapters on beamed-power and solar-sail spacecraft. Websites with articles on the solar sail technology: $URL$ This webpage has the text of several articles by Gregory Matloff about solar-sails. $URL$ $URL$ The two webpages above have the basic details supported by calculation for solar-sails. www.esa.int/esapub/bulletin/bullet108/chapter6_bul108.pdf The ESA Bulletin article details various solar-sail missions. Proceedings of the Second International Symposium on Solar Sailing www.citytech.cuny.edu/isss2010/ISSS2010Proceedingsvx.pdf The Proceedings are a gold mine of papers on solar-sails and lightsails. No other way of summarizing its contents. On a related space technology dusty plasma sail vehicles. $URL$ This presentation outlines an alternative sail technology, while similar to magnetic sails, it utilizes a plasma confined inside an artificial magnetosphere laced with very small particles of dust and interacts with the plasma of the solar wind instead of solar radiation. The proposal suggests this would be comparable to conventional solar-sails, possibly better. 

What would separate magic and science so much that neither acknowledges the existence of the other? I suggest this hangs on the nature of magic itself. Magic as it appears in most fantasies functions like a form of super-powers. Example: wizard points her wand at cowering victim and a bolt of purple lightning zapped victim into a neat pile of ash. If magic was like that there's no way science could ignore its existence. Also readily reproducable magic could be studied, eventually the mechanisms for magic would be discovered, then magic could be improved and upgraded. Leading to a civilisation where magic and science would work hand in hand transforming our world for good or evil. The way magic operates in traditional societies (this means pre-industrial pre-scientific, and pre-modern) was more like this. A tree falls on Fred's house and no-one's hurt. That's an accident. Just nature at work undermining the tree so it fell down. If the tree fell on Fred's house killing him. Now that's sorcery. When unexpected events harm or kill people, then malign intent must be behind them. The sorcery expresses malign intentions, but it may turn up in unexpected and unanticipated ways. Perhaps even the sorcerer cannot predict what will happen. This is quite unlike magic operating like default super-powers. What a sorcerer might do is perform a ritual and then sometime later harm will come to the intended victim. For example, sorcerer writes Fred's name and the word DIE on a piece of paper and burns it. Two years later Fred dies of a heart attack or it could be his wife who dies instead. Later Fred dies from despair and a broken heart. This isn't the same as Fred dropping dead straight after the ritual. This model of magic suggests by its very nature magic may be wilful and contrary. So if scientists suspected ritual magic was real and tried to study it, this makes it impossible to get verifiable results. This is apart from the problems in trying to their research approved by the Ethics Committee. Perhaps if the magic they tried to test only was aimed at producing beneficial results. Like poor Fred winning the lottery (his luck had to change eventually). Anyone who looks at what magic was like historically or how it is perceived by societies studied by anthropologists will soon realise these traditional forms of magic were and are rarely susceptible to scientific study. Magic is often very different from how it is presented in fantasy. This provides an answer to why scientists would ignore magic. Its influence in the natural world is invisible and not very different from chance outcomes. Also, people who believe in sorcery are obviously deluded because they believe their spells, incantations and rituals can influence the course of events. Now for the other part of the question: why don't magic users study science, perhaps with the object of improving their magic, or just understanding magic better? I admit this isn't the strongest reason, but here goes. Perhaps there is something about the scientific worldview that undermines the practice of magic. Once a sorcerer studies and thinks of the nature of the world scientifically, this means they can no longer work magic. Actually this might go the other way too. Any scientist who fully embraced a magical worldview might be unable to do science well. This also means scientists who believed in magic and wanted to study it scientifically would be rubbish at research into magic (as scientists). This means I've come up with two answers (not what I intended doing, but sometimes the magic works by itself). One, the nature of magic itself may be such that it can't be studied by science. Scientists would ignore magic, because nothing in nature needs magic to explain it. Sorcerers would practice their magic, but even they might not be able to study how it works. Two, magic and science require mutually exclusive worldviews. This is more than sufficient to separate magic users and scientists into distinct and mutually exclusive communities, each effectively invisible to each other. 

(A) "Kardashev type III civilisation with high levels of control and information processing, leading to them having the ability to cause any physical phenomenon that isn't physically impossible" will simply use mind control to suppress any unwanted technological development. Admittedly the OP hasn't explained how or where the space wizards have concealed their Kardashev type III technology. Possibly, this gives the OP and the apparently incompetent sensor operators the spaceship Exciting Undertaking a way out, the space wizards are capable of high-level concealment or what constitutes Kardashev type III technology is utterly unrecognizable to mere primitive space crews. The local population would be mind blocked from recognizing it anyway. Now to analyse the OP's answer criteria Likelihood of failure: How likely the space wizards are to throw off the shackles and go forth to once again almost blow up everything. There is one problem here. A contradiction between the space wizards being struck at Renaissance level technology and maintaining the populace in retro-technological subjugation. This once the system was set up it was left running on auto-pilot. if there are some space wizards who know what is really going the temptation to go full-blown Kardashev type III civilisation will be overwhelming. It could happen at any time especially when a bunch of nosey parkers, for example, in the spaceship Exciting Undertaking turns up. Longevity: How long this suppression is likely to remain in place before suffering catastrophic system failure. As long as some random or unexpected event doesn't tip the balance. Anywhere between five minutes and five billion years. It is to be expected that normal astronomical events going red giant, nova or white dwarf can be fixed by a Kardashev type III civilisation. Ease of implementation: How much effort the original space wizards would have to put in in order to put this system in place. Presumably this was a former colony planet of a Kardashev type III civilisation and they subtly processed colonists as they arrived. The result would be a full blown Renaissance civilization with a bunch of space wizards pulling the strings. Unless the space wizards want ed to go Renaissance level too. Rule of Coolness: More of a jokey (hugely subjective) category, but we all know that cool things work better in space. Cool enough, but not too chilly. Does seem strangely like a typical of those guys and gals who used to go boldly where no person had boldly gone before in their split infinitive hyperdrive. Answer: Simple, straight forward mind control. Why bother with anything complicated? They're Kardashev type III technology level space wizards, so what could be easier?
