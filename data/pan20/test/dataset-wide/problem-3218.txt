According to historian A. Roger Ekirch's At Day's Close, peoples in pre-industrial societies actually went to bed as soon at it was too dark to work, and slept (and still do sleep in such areas today) in two fourish-hour phases, interrupted by a short period of activity. He found numerous references to this in literature, from Medieval literature to Homer. However, the electric lighting available to modern industrialized societies resulted in people staying active after dark, and thus needing to skip the middle activity period to make up for it. Ekirch argues that these days we have become so used to an uninterrupted 6-8 hour sleep that we have trouble translating the concepts of "first sleep" and "second sleep" from older literature (hiding the fact that they existed), and those who wake up for a while in the middle of the night often think they have some kind of disorder. 

For the most part yes, as their fundamental issue in both cases was support for segregation and white supremecy. They were a bit different in theory, in that the AIP was founded as a conservative (far right) party that then courted southern whites, while the Dixiecrats were formed out of the southern Democratic party. However, in practice they both drew all their strength in their best years from the same sources. The Dixecrats won Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and South Carolina (and one EV from Tennesse) in 1948, while in 1968 the AIP won Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Georgia. 

Perhaps sometime in the future when all his contemporaries are deceased, the unedited diaries will be allowed to pass into the care of some group that will allow outside historians access to them. 

As a point of clarification those "two torpedo hits" happened in separate incidents, and each separately caused her to have to be laid up in drydock for repairs. 

In theory, yes that would cover any religion. In practice, not just no but hell no. Indian cultures, of which their religious beliefs were an integral part, were considered uncivilized and inferior. In the logic of time, this naturally meant the Indian "way of life" was an active harm to the Indians, as well as a standing threat to their neighbors. As such there was a concerted effort to eradicate their culture, and convert the Indians to the European-American cultural package of English, Christianity, and agriculture*. Particularly in the 19th and early 20th century there was a philosophy among Americans and Western Europeans that along with the benefits of having a more powerful and advanced culture came a responsibility to bring those benefits to the rest of the world that was clearly saddled with inferior cultures. (Some would argue this attitude persists largely unchanged today). Thus were born the American Indian boarding schools. The idea was that older Indians may be "set in their ways", but if you could take their kids away from them, you could raise them in the American culture instead, which always included Christianity. Generally at these schools (many run by the US government) children were forbidden to speak their native languages, wear their native dress, or practice their native religion. The schools were theoretically voluntary, but eventually the BIA started requiring education of all children to a western standard, which left many tribes with no other option. Things are much better these days, but in many ways its too late now. The Native "churches" I'm aware of are all heavily influenced by Christianity. The original religions are all but lost. * - It was (and often still is) actually a bit of a myth that Native Americans didn't practice agriculture. Most did, but it was generally considered women's work. So the main difference here was really cultural rather than practical. 

Now if they did this in the usual Egyptian idiom: going further up the Nile, then it would be somewhere nearish Lake Victoria itself, as that is the Nile's source. The only other reasonable location in that era would have been the rift valley chain of lakes. Any other route I believe would require traversing tropical forest on foot, which looks far easier on a map than it is in actuality. 

Fortunately for our purposes, this paper goes directly into the implications of this with respect to bread: 

From The Rover Boys In Camp, published 1904. A parody cartoon of this series was produced in 1942 (after your requested time, but still prior to the 1950's), where the villain Dan Backslide was depicted as playing pool while doing his evil plotting, in a place described by the narrator of the cartoon as "a tavern of unsavory repute" (in case you didn't get it from the pool table). 

I believe the first "programmable" devices in common industrial use were the big industrial power looms in England in the late 18th and early 19th century. The Jacquard loom in 1801 was the first to use punched-cards for its programming. Way over in Ukraine, Russian Semen Korasakov saw the potential of these cards for information storage and retrieval, and designed machines for this purpose in the early 1830s. Wikipedia claims that up to this time nobody was using the cards outside of the textile industry. Sadly, it appears that nobody outside of far eastern Europe heard of Karasakov's devices until the 20th century. When mathemetician Ada Lovelace was helping Charles Babbage with his Analytical Engine design (the first known semi-practical programmable mechanical computing device design) in the 1830's, they borrowed the idea of programming it via punched-cards. Countess Lovelace went so far as to write down and publish an algorithm for it. Based on this, it is argued that she was the world's first computer programmer. Jonathan Aylen says that steel mills were indeed using punched cards for programming before computers, and that the transition was so gradual that it is in fact hard to say exactly when computer steel mill control actually begain. So presumably the cards were eventually being used in mills other than just textile mills (eg: steel, lumber, paper) before computer controls were introduced. However, it appears that the idea of using them in computing devices is actually older than that. 

Speaking as a resident of a neighboring state (which had its own land issues), while this was perhaps entertainingly phrased, nothing in there sounds at all unlikely or outlandish. Assuming (which I think is safe) that his "vast hegira" happened piecemeal rather than all at once, I find nothing whatsoever in there difficult to believe. What is left is an entertaining exposition on the prevalence of endemic surveying errors (and the ability of the rich/well-connected to get such errors resolved in their favor). This most certainly was the case in eighteenth and nineteenth century America, not only on the local level, but even as regards to state boundaries. The book How the States Got their Shapes goes into this in detail. If you ever wondered about the odd little straight-edge bends some state boundaries have (see Alabama), more often than not a surveying error was involved somewhere. Just thumbing through the first third of the book, I found surveying errors having a hand in the modern borders between five pairs of states, and out and out corruption probably involved in two. The border between Iowa and Missouri was particularly interesting, in that it involved both. 

Part of the point of these codenames is so that if enemy intelligence gets hold of some of the chatter about the operation, it isn't immediately obvious what the exact objective is. So ideally, yes the names will be completely random. 

The best example I know of is what happened to Holy Roman Emperor Henry IV. He got into a dispute with the Pope over appointment rights, which culminated in the Pope excommunicating Henry (and Henry in turn declaring the pope deposed). Since Emperors were crowned by the Pope, this opened up a path for Henry's political rivals to claim he was no longer rightful Emperor. Henry's political position in the HRE was weak enough that he felt like compromise would be best, so he performed the proscribed penance. This included, as the story goes, waiting on his knees in the snow for 3 days for the Pope. The impending revolt by the German nobles happened anyway, but this bought Henry enough popular support that he was able to defeat it. When the Pope then excommunicated Henry again, it was such a transparently personal attack that it did Henry little political harm. He simply marched on Rome and installed his own Pope. 

The problem with answering this is that Europe for the most part was illiterate at the time. We do know from the literate areas that there was tremendous upheval in Fertile Crescent at about this time. In this period the (illiterate) Dorians wiped out Mycenean civilization, plunging the Greek area into a dark age. Technically this was Europe. Then a horde of sea peoples (many speculate displaced Myceneans) took to raiding south into the Levant and Egypt. Egypt was mostly strong enough to beat them back, but the peoples of the Levant weren't so fortunate. The Hittite capitol was destroyed (actually not sure by whose hand, but sea peoples are a leading guess), and its empire collpsed. Some of the remnants (so-called neo-Hittites) marched out and conqered Babylonia, along with the Aramaeans (essentially Arab pastorilists from the south). Many also speculate the sea peoples were the Biblical Philistines, who according to the Bible attempted to ensure Israel's continued military inferiority by denying them access to iron. All of this upheaval could have been a coincidence with the popularization of iron, but I generally don't believe in such large coincidences. Also we know that in sub-Saharan Africa, the Iron Age appears coincident with the period of Bantu expansion, where speakers of that language family took over all cultivatable land in the tropical peninsula of the continent (a huge area). You could picture this process as a peaceful one, but when Europeans later bumped into the southernmost tribes of this movement (the Zulu), they didn't find them all that peaceful. The rise of the Phoenicians (later Carthaginians) in North Africa roughly coincides with the period where they were the only iron users in North Africa. Checking over my sources for darker (illiterate) Europe, there doesn't seem to be any serious cultural changes associated with the switch to Iron use. So it could be that in this zone Anixx's reasoning in his answer applies. Or it could just be that what did happen wasn't all that apparent to archeologists. 

Churchill always maintained publicly that, worst case, their government would retreat to its colonies (most likely Canada) and try to fight on from there. For example, there is this often overlooked coda to his Fight them on the beaches speech: 

We don't really know. For comparison, note that historians are still arguing over what exactly caused the fall of the (western) Roman Empire, which at the time was the most literate Civilization on earth. If they can't agree on that, it is probably not reasonable to expect certain knowledge about the exact cause for the decline of a bronze-age civilization that was barely literate (and what little we have undeciphered), and had no literate neighbors. All we can really know is what archeology can tell us. It does appear that it declined and eventually faded away over a long period of time, rather than just mysteriously disappearing one day. That makes disaster theories like destruction at the hand of an Ayrian Invasion much less attractive than they used to be. The current darling appears to be Climate change (drought). However I should warn you that Climate change appears to be the go-to explanation these days for the decline of any culture we don't have good records for (and some we do). This may be due to the fact that it really has been the major stressing factor for cultures in human history, but the cynic in me has to wonder if its just a scholatic fad.
