I know that Lincoln's views changed a lot from when he was growing up to the Lincoln-Douglas debates, but how did his views change? From what? 

With the Hamilton (a musical by Lin-Manuel Miranda about Alexander Hamilton's life) craze going around, I've heard a few of the songs. While they are typically very easy to understand, one lyric I didn't understand was in "Washington on Your Side" when Madison, Jefferson, and Burr say: "[MADISON] So he’s doubled the size of the government / Wasn’t the trouble with much of our previous government size? [BURR] Look in his eyes! [JEFFERSON] See how he lies [MADISON] Follow the scent of his enterprise [JEFFERSON] Centralizing national credit / And making American credit competitive [MADISON] If we don’t stop it we aid and abet it [JEFFERSON] I have to resign". What does it mean that Alexander Hamilton made American credit competitive? 

It refers to the people then and the people now, just the people in general who aren't happy with their government. 

I've read about Democratic-Republicans, and I've never seen it mentioned that they actually didn't use the term, but I read that (from $URL$ 

I've learned about how Luther's 95 Theses were extremely important to the Protestant Reformation and how they really defined the beginnings of Protestantism. According to History.com's article on "Martin Luther and the 95 Theses", the two main points of the theses were "that the Bible is the central religious authority and that humans may reach salvation only by their faith and not by their deeds", which would support what I've been taught, as the idea of sola fide is heresy, according to the Catholic church. However, I read through them, I didn't find that. They really only support the idea that Indulgences aren't right and that the greed found in the Catholic Church at the time wasn't acceptable. Most of them even include references to purgatory (which is heresy in Protestantism), and "works of mercy" and "works of love", which is the language commonly used to refer to the Catholic Church's works necessary for salvation, which Luther was supposed to disagree with (also heresy in Protestantism). What causes this seeming discrepancy? Why are the theses so important if they only address the idea that the Church's greed wasn't right? I understand that was a radical position at the time, given that the Church ruled essentially everything and dissenters were punished, but there is a wide margin between saying greed is bad and breaking away from the Catholic Church and beginning a new denomination. 

Hinduism is considered to be the oldest religion in terms of those religions which are still recognized and practiced to this day but it is far from the oldest religion ever practiced. The first religious practices that we know of is referred to as Paleolithic Religion. Though not written, evidence uncovered by archeologists suggests that Neanderthals practiced religious rituals more than 300,000 years ago (essentially as far back in time as we have discovered). Burial rituals suggest that Neanderthals had a concern for the dead which transcended life. Without spiritual beliefs such practice would not have existed. It is disputed whether burial rituals signify religious beliefs as opposed to simply hygiene. If you were to assume that it was merely the act of hygiene then even still their are records in the form of cave paintings and figures showing a female fertility goddess known as Venus. Among the first human images discovered are the "Venus figures," nude female figures having exaggerated sexual parts that date back to the Cro-Magnons of the Upper Paleolithic period between 35,000 and 10,000 BC. In southern France is the Venus of Laussel which is carved in basrelief in a rock shelter. This appears once to have been a hunting shrine which dates to around 19,000 BC. In this carving the woman is painted red, perhaps to suggest blood, and holds a bison horn in one hand. Also in Cro-Magnon cave paintings women are depicted giving birth. "A naked Goddess appears to have been the patroness of the hunt to mammoth hunters in the Pyrenees and was also protectress of the hearth and lady of the wild things." Other female figurines were discovered dating back to the proto-Neolithic period of ca, 9000 - 7000 BC, the Middle Neolithic period of ca. 6000 - 5000 BC, and the Higher Neolithic period of ca. 4500 - 3500 BC. Some of these figurines were decorated as if they had been objects of worship. In black Africa were discovered cave images of the Horned Goddess (later Isis, ca. 7000 - 6000 BC). The Black Goddess images appeared to represent a bisexual, self-fertilizing woman. During the predynastic Egyptian period, prior to 3110 BC, the Goddess was known as Ta-Urt (Great One) and was portrayed as a pregnant hippopotamus stand on her hind legs. 300,000 years ago – first (disputed) evidence of intentional burial of the dead. 130,000 years ago – Earliest undisputed evidence for intentional burial. Neanderthal. 100,000 years ago – The oldest known ritual burial of modern humans 100,000 to 50,000 years ago – Increased use of red ochre at several Middle Stone Age sites. Red Ochre is thought to have played an important role in ritual. 50,000 years ago – Humans have evolved the traits associated with modern human behavior.... such as modern language, abstract thought, symbolism and religion.[23] 42,000 years ago – Ritual burial of a man at Lake Mungo in Australia. The body is sprinkled with copious amounts of red ochre - seen as evidence that the Australians had brought along with them religious rituals from Africa. 40,000 years ago – Upper Paleolithic begins in Europe... elaborate burials of the dead, Venus figurines and cave art. Venus figurines are thought to represent fertility goddesses. The cave paintings at Chauvet and Lascaux are believed to represent religious thought. 30,000 years ago – Earliest known burial of a shaman. 11,000 years ago – The Neolithic Revolution begins. $URL$ $URL$ 

Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings (the slave he had an affair with) were thirty years apart in age (he older than her). I've asked a few history-loving friends and they told me that even if Jefferson had married someone the same age as Hemings (thirty years younger than him), it wouldn't have been frowned upon at all because 60-70 year old men commonly took teenage or 20-some-year-old wives. Now, however, most people would consider this behavior disgusting and try to help the girl. When did this shift happen in the US and how? 

I've been reading some different sources about the relationship between Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings and some authors seem to emphasize that she was essentially a sex slave, while other authors make it seem like it was consensual on her part. Is there any solid evidence either way? Obviously she couldn't exactly say no, but has anything been recorded that says she didn't want to enter into the type of relationship she had with Jefferson? 

So I understand, maybe, how arming people to hurt others is treason because the "others" who will be hurt are Americans. So is it treason if, for example, a gun store owner provides a gun to someone s/he knows will use it to hurt others? I'm sure that's something, maybe indirect murder or something, but is it treason? If not, why was John Brown's raid treason? 

I'm researching the Armenian genocide on a very basic level, and I've learned that a lot of the tension between Armenians and the Turks was because the Armenians were seen as supporting the Russians, who the Turks hated. Why was there such tension? What did Russia or Turkey do to prove one another? 

I've been reading through Hamilton's Report on Manufactures recently, and he suggests that women and children work in factories to help ease the labor competition between the North and South. However, this was highly controversial and people hated it. However, it was normal in Great Britain and it wasn't quite as contested. Why was Hamilton's idea so controversial and not Great Britain's?
