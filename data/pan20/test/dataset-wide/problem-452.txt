From the description, odds are very high your rear derailer hanger needs to be aligned, you've got excess cable friction, or both. Both can create situations where it seems impossible to get it shifting and running smoothly in all gears. Hanger alignment in particular has quietly become a much bigger deal over the years, as rear shifting has only gotten more sensitive to it, and many bikes have very easily tweaked replaceable hangers. If you don't want to buy a hanger alignment tool or take it to a shop, you can typically make it at least somewhat better on an easily-bent aluminum replaceable hanger by bending it around with your 5mm allen stuck in the pivot bolt. 

The most important thing to do to keep the inside dry and prevent excess rust is a proper drain hole on the underside of the bottom bracket. Outside of issues with heavily salted roads, drain holes are enough to prevent meaningful rust. The next step is something like Weigle framesaver, or just a blast of aerosol lube every couple years in each tube. Framesaver is great against salted roads, but otherwise is usually overkill. 

You started with too much slack for the barrel adjuster(s) to take up. Note you have one on your derailer and one on your shifter, and they both do exactly the same thing, so maybe by using both you'll have enough adjustability, or maybe not. It doesn't matter because you don't really want to be maxing them out anyway. You need to re-anchor the cable in a more reasonable spot, and ideally check a few other things along the way. Shift the shifter into the highest position. (Slackest cable tension, biggest number, the one you get to by pressing the pointer finger lever a bunch of times.) Loosen the RD cable anchor. Pedal the bike so that the chain is on the smallest cog. Take the opportunity with all the cable tension off to visually check that your high limit screw is set correctly. Looking behind the bike, the center plane of the RD pulleys should be that of the right/outer plane of the smallest cog, or in other words very close to but just a little to the right of the center plane as the smallest cog teeth. (counter-intuitive but true, as per Shimano.) Screw both barrel adjusters all the way in, then screw one out one full turn so you have some adjustability in both directions if needed. Using any pliers, grab the end of the cable and pull it taut while tightening the anchor bolt back down. You don't need to pull it hard. You want it to be clamped at the spot that makes it just taut. Unless there are other problems with cable friction, busted housings, hanger alignment, damage to the derailer, etc, the bike should now be approximately shifting, although the shifting will need final adjustment to perform correctly. But before you do that, since you had problems with excessive slack that started all this, you should do one more step that will reduce and/or eliminate further such issues with "stretch." (Whether or not the cable is physically stretching at all is a contested issue, but it doesn't matter, and either way it's not the main thing causing the slack.) Keeping the shifter in the same highest/slackest position, hang the bike by the seat off a stand or tree or something, and pedal the cranks with one hand while pulling gently on an exposed part of the cable with the other. Once you're in the lowest/largest cog, stop pedaling, stop the rear wheel from spinning and pull hard on the cable. Let go, pedal again to get the chain back down to the high gear, and see if you've created slack in the cable. If so, that's a good thing, because it would have happened eventually anyway. If there is slack then take it out by repeating the above re-anchoring procedure. At this point, dial in the shifting with the barrel adjusters so that it shifts smoothly with minimal hesitation in both directions, and you should be set. 

They used to be, but unless you're using something weird like Miche cassettes, they're not really available new anymore. The best giveaway to measure wear is how it does with a Rohloff HG/IG checker. Second best is whether its teeth are blunted and smooshed at the roller contact area. 

First double check that it's not a simple case of it just being tight, which is actually pretty common. Remove the bolt completely and gently wedge it open just a little bit with a screwdriver, and see if it will fit on then. Do not force it - you're checking to see if it fits correctly albeit a bit snugly. If that doesn't work, and/or if it's just clearly the wrong size completely, you need to measure both the clamp you've got and the outside diameter of the seat tube. Ideally use a caliper. You could almost get away with just using a ruler to see what size the frame is actually "trying to be", but the problem is that frames do exist just .5mm larger than 34.9, even though 34.9 (aka 35mm) is much more common. There are some weird, semi-proprietary diameters in the 35-36mm range that have given rise to clamps like this and this. 36.4mm is also a standard size, but as far as I've observed it's not common for carbon road bikes. 

You have a lot of spoke windup and the wheel goes way out of true very quickly. You will probably hear pinging when you ride it for the first time if this is the case, but it can be silent too. Side-loading the wheel off the bike a little can alleviate some windup, but not necessarily all of it. Test riding in a manner that heavily side-loads the wheel, like riding out of the saddle with the bike canted over, can have the same effect, and is a way to get additional windup worked out before you really start riding it. The difference is that off the bike, the common methods of sideloading contact the rim at two or more points, whereas on the bike the load is concentrated at one. Most new wheelbuilders will experience a greater or lesser degree of this problem before you master getting windup out with spoke wrench technique alone, which involves overshooting and backturning the wrench on each nipple and being sensitive to the feel of the spokes trying to twist. You have way too much tension on the rim, and at the first significant side load on the wheel, which could be turning or standing out of the saddle, the wheel fails in a column buckling mode. In other words, the rim was just barely able to handle the static load on it from spoke tension, and the addition of a little side load causes it to collapse, like an overloaded column. This can also happen when sideloading the wheel out of the bike. While not common per se, most mechanics and wheelbuilders experience or observe this sooner or later. This is more potentially dangerous if it happens on the bike because it does involve a sudden loss of structural integrity. Like the above, if you want to test for it before riding for wheel, then riding the bike in a manner that heavily but realistically sideloads the wheel in a safe, controlled, low-speed way is how to do it. 

Ideally, the first thing to check is how good the fit is, or in other words whether tolerances are causing or contributing to the problem despite the nominal sizes matching. That way you have a better sense of what you're up against. If the post has a lot of slop with the collar loose, it's possible nothing will make it work, although that's an outlier. Now that carbon grip is an everyday item, there's no reason not to use it in slipping post situations regardless of material. So start by cleaning everything, putting a generous amount of that on the post/frame interface, and making sure all the mating surfaces of the collar and bolt are clean and greased. That's about as much as you can do without changing parts. If that doesn't work and it's a bolt-down collar as opposed to QR, the first thing to look at is how beefy the collar is, if applicable. The thicker and heavier, the harder it pinches the post and the less it itself flexes as the bolt is torqued. Slippage happening due to tolerances on frames with collar type clamps can often be obliterated by just putting on a stiffer collar. If it's a QR collar, there are some bad ones of those in the world, and they can get worn/mangled with repeated hard re-tightening, so replacing them can be necessary. Bolt down ones clamp harder in general too, so if you don't care about QR then that can make sense. (The average case scenario of a slipping post in shops is it's a junky QR collar, and the fix is replace it with a bolt down one and slather with carbon grip. Usually fixes everything.) If it's an integral clamp, or none of the above fixes it, and it's not an undersize post, then some of the more advanced, shop-tool-requiring fixes can come into play, such as reaming the seattube or knurling the post. Sometimes the seattube opening needs some reworking too.
