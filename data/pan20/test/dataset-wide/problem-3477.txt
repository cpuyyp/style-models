A note on marginal benefit and cost: When performing this kind of analysis, We typically assume that the objective is to maximise to total social welfare (green line), which is defined as the difference between the total accumulated benefit of the activity (blue line) and the total accumulated cost (red line): 

Typically, a devaluation is achieved by selling the domestic currency in the foreign exchange market and buying other currencies. Suppose China sells one trillion Renminbi and buys 157 billion US dollars. From the point of view of the market, it is as if the supply of Renminbi just increased. As in any competitive market, an increase in supply will cause the price (i.e. the exchange rate) to fall: one Yuan will be worth less than before. Devaluations are good for a country's balance of trade. Companies based in China ultimately care about how many Yuan they end up with. Suppose that the value of the Renminbi is 10 Yuan = \$1US. That means that a Chinese product priced at 10 Yuan would cost an American \$1 to buy. Now suppose that the value of the Renmimbi falls by half: 10 Yuan = \$0.50. Now the same product, still priced at 10 Yuan, will only cost an American 50 cents. It's as if everything China exports just got cheaper! This fall in the apparent price of Chinese exports will make people in other countries want to buy more Chinese products so that China will experience an increase in its exports. The argument also works in reverse: to a Chinese person, the devaluation makes it look as if American products got more expensive, so Chinese will demand fewer American (and British, and German, etc.) products and China will import less. Together, these two effects mean that China's balance of trade (i.e. the difference between exports and imports) will improve as a consequence of the devaluation. 

It seems that the predictions in the second point correspond to the "beliefs" invoked by Osborne. However, it is important to stress that these predictions/"beliefs", are merely an informal/intuitive tool for helping us to conceptualise what is going on in an equilibrium and are not part of the definition of such an equilibrium. The concept of Nash equilibrium itself is completely agnostic on the notion of beliefs (as you note in a comment, it is defined only over actions), which is why, when Osborne goes on to formally define Nash equilibrium, he does so without invoking the idea of beliefs at all. 

These might be considered fairly canonical claims in the sense that they emerge naturally from many 'textbook' models from introductory economics or industrial organization. That means that many students of economics are exposed to such claims through the lens of theory. I would like to supplement this with empirical evidence. I am looking for references to empirical work that supports or refutes one or more of the abovee claims (or close variants of them). Particularly welcome would be survey articles covering literatures that address them. 

Completeness requires that the consumer can rank all of the relevant states of the world, where a state is relevant if it could potentially be chosen by the consumer. This is obviously a big ask because there are typically a large number of factors affecting a decision problem, so the number of states a consumer must consider is large. In practice, consumers use heuristics and approximations to solve their decision problems; they, of course, do not solve the formal, fully-specified optimisation problem. This modelling approach is, nevertheless, useful if it offers a good approximation of consumer behaviour while also making a good trade-off between tractability and empirical relevance. In fact, models of consumer demand and choice based on this simple framework typically do quite well at explaining behaviour, suggesting that this particular modelling simplification is quite useful. The field of behavioural economics deals with situations in which consumers systematically deviate from this optimal decision process, including cases where they do not consider the full set of states. 

Building on london's answer, and the question in the comments about how agencies deal with erroneous data supplied by governments, here is a relevant IMF paper. "How to Check Integrity of Fiscal Data". The abstract: 

This is a partial answer, in the sense that it addresses the case for state-sponsored house building, rather than the question of how that should be financed. In general, any means by which the state might finance spending is likely to introduce some kind of distortion into the economy. The question then faced is whether that spending generates benefits sufficient to offset the cost of the distortion. I agree with the general sentiment of others that if there is a well-functioning, uninhibited market for housing then any intervention in that market (such as an artificial increase in supply) is likely to reduce overall efficiency and, in particular, lead to the misallocation of resources within the economy more broadly. @suriv outlined the intuition for this. However, if there are distortions that prevent the housing market from functioning efficiently then a state-sponsored increase in housing supply can be efficiency enhancing. This is a simple application of the more general "Theory of the Second Best", which holds that if there is pre-existing distortion in the economy then introducing another distortion can sometimes make things better, not worse. There are various reasons why the housing market might not function efficiently. Here are a couple: 

Comparing the two The two solutions, $$b(v_i)=v_i\frac{n-1}{n},\qquad b(c_i)=\frac{1+c_i(n-1)}{n}$$ are equivalent in the sense that a bidder in the first price auction shades (bids below his true valuation) by exactly the same amount as a bidder in a procurement auction bids above his true cost. You can confirm this by, for example, plotting these two bid functions for some value of $n$. Here's an example with $n=2$: 

A foundational result from models of perfect competition is that the competitive market equilibrium (i.e. setting price and quantity such that supply = demand) is efficient. By efficiency we mean that the sum of consumer surplus and producer surplus are maximised. This is actually quite an amazing thing! It means that each individual consumer buys the good if and only if the welfare he receives from doing so is greater than the marginal cost of producing the good. To see that this must be true, suppose that there were a consumer who values a good at more than the cost of production but did not buy it. Then it would be possible to increase welfare by having the consumer buy the good, contradicting the result that the equilibrium is optimal. Similarly, efficiency demands that sellers produce exactly as much as is necessary to sell to the consumers who will ultimately buy. How could we get to this efficient point? One way would be to have economists calculate what is efficient and then publish this information so that people could look-up whether they are supposed to buy/sell or not. But wait! We know that there aren't economists running round telling consumers whether it would be efficient for them to buy or not. So how do people figure this out for themselves?! The answer is that the equilibrium price contains all of the information that they need to figure out what is efficient. Since the equilibrium price is equal to marginal cost, and since consumers will buy if their willingness to pay is above the price, a consumer wishes to purchase if amd only if his willngness to pay is bigger than the costâ€”i.e. exactly when it is efficient for him to do so. Thus, one way to think about the role of a price in a competitive market is that it transmits information to market participants about the efficiency of a trade they are contemplating. 

A classic reference that is somewhat related is Ronald Coase's "The Nature of the Firm". Coase set out to address the following puzzle: since markets are efficient, why do we need to organize into firms? Couldn't we just have each individual acting alone and rely on the market to put the pieces together into complete products? Coases answer to why this wouldn't work well was transaction costs. If there is a (small) cost to engaging in market transactions then the aggregate cost of the many transactions needed to assemble complicated products will be prohibitive. The solution, argues Coase, is to form an organization (a firm) within which all of these transactions can take place without recourse to the market. Coase's reasoning has been expanded in the 80 years since its publication. Notably, Oliver Williamson did important work to dig into the details of the conditions that make organizing work within a firm especially attractive. He argued that firms should be most likely to form when work is relationship-specific and when there are significant difficulties in writing and enforcing contracts. A great summary of Williamson's work can be found here. Both Coase and Williamson received the Nobel prize for this work.
