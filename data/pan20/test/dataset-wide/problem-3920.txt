where $l(w)$ is the length of $w \in W$. This rule for simple reflections implies that for any $w_1, w_2 \in W$ $(B\dot{w}_1 B)(B\dot{w}_2B) = \coprod_{w \in U} B\dot{w}B$, where $U \subset W$. However, knowing what this subset $U$ is seems quite complicated (I think one can put some partial conditions on $U$ involving Bruhat order). My question is if anyone has seen a description of which cells appear in $(B\dot{w}_1 B)(B\dot{w}_2B)$ (i.e., what does $U$ look like)? Or, does anyone know of some nice connections between any aspects of this problem and some other theory? It seems likely to me that the decomposition of $(B\dot{w}_1 B)(B\dot{w}_2B)$ is much to complicated to have any single rule for arbitrary $w_1, w_2$. But, I thought I'd pose this question to M.O. just in case. Thanks! 

Here is a (probably equivalent) way to see this. I'll give an argument for $(BsB)(BwB)$, where $s$ is a simple reflection. You should be able to expand this argument to $(BvB)(BwB)$ as requested in the question. The expansion will use the fact that $\ell(vw) = \ell(v) + \ell(w)$ implies $\ell(s_t \cdots s_1 w) = t + \ell(w)$, where $s_n \cdots s_1 = v$ is a reduced decomposition for $v$ and $n \geq t$. Throughout, let $T\subset B$ be a fixed maximal torus and $U \subset B$ the unipotent subgroup of $B$. Recall that $B = TU$. For any positive root $\alpha$, let $U_\alpha$ be the corresponding root subgroup of $U$. Recall that for any ordering of positive roots, we can write $U$ as a produce of $U_\alpha$ in the chosen order. Fix an odering of positive roots so that $U = U_{w{-1}} U_{w_0w^{-1}}$, where $w_0$ is the longest element of the Weyl group. Then, the elements of $BwB$ are uniquely written as $U_{w^{-1}}wB$, where \begin{equation} U_{w^{-1}} = \prod_{\alpha \in R(w^{-1})} U_\alpha. \end{equation} Here, $R(w^{-1}) =\{\alpha \in R^+\;|\; w^{-1} \alpha <0\;\}$. This decomposition follows from the Bruhat decomposition because if $w^{-1} \alpha >0$, then $w^{-1} u_{\alpha} w = u_{w^{-1} \alpha}$, and so $ u_{\alpha} w = wu_{w^{-1} \alpha}$ and $u_{w^{-1} \alpha} \in B$. So, this element is absorbed to the right. Then, every element $ b s b_1b_2 w \tilde{b} \in (BsB)(BwB)$ can be written in the form $BsuwB$, where $u \in U_{w^{-1}}$ as above. Explicitly, $b_1b_2 = t(uu') \in B$, where $t \in T$ and $(uu')\in U_{w{-1}} U_{w_0w^{-1}}$ according to the decomposition given above. Then, $ t(uu')w \tilde{b} = u b'$ for some $u \in U_{w^{-1}}$ and $b' \in B$. For each $(b_1b_2)$, we get a unique $u b'$. If we can show that $sR(w^{-1}) \subset R^+$, then for $u = u_{\alpha_1} \cdots u_{\alpha_k}$ (i.e, $\alpha_i \in R(w^{-1})$) we have \begin{equation} su = s (u_{\alpha_1} \cdots u_{\alpha_k})=(u_{s\alpha_1} \cdots u_{s\alpha_k})s, \end{equation} and $(u_{s\alpha_1} \cdots u_{s\alpha_k}) \in B$. Then, every $b s b_1b_2 w \tilde{b}= b(u_{s\alpha_1} \cdots u_{s\alpha_k})sw b'$. This tells us that every $b_3 sw b_4 = b(u_{s\alpha_1} \cdots u_{s\alpha_k})sw b'$ (sorry for the excessive indexing), where $(b_1b_2)$ can be arbitrary because we need only adjust $b$ and $b'$ to make this equation work. However, once $(b_1b_2)$ is fixed, $b$ and $b'$ are determined by this value. To show $s R(w^{-1}) \subset R^+$, we use the assumption that \begin{equation} 1+ \ell(w^{-1}) = 1 + \ell(w) = \ell(sw) = \ell(w^{-1}s) . \end{equation} So, $|R(w^{-1}s)| = |R(w^{-1})| + 1$ since the cardinality of $R(w)$ is just the length of $w$. Using a basic formula for $R(w^{-1}s)$ (see, e.g., Springer's Linear Algebraic Groups, section 8.3.1) this implies $s R(w^{-1}) \subset R^+$ as desired. 

Question: is there some relative version of the Serre spectral sequence that allows me to compute the relative cohomology groups of $(E,E')$ from the cohomology of $(F,F')$ and $B$ (case 1), resp. the cohomology of $F$ and $(B,B')$ (case 2)? Some reference would be perfect. If some topological assumption on the spaces or maps are required, I am dealing with classifying spaces and Borel constructions applied to smooth actions on manifolds, so it is very well behaved stuff. 

I will start by saying that I am not a symplectic topology. However, in my research I now have on my hands a symplectic 4-orbifold, which I would like to understand better. Certain results for symplectic manifolds (e.g. Weinsteinâ€™s Lagrangian neighborhood theorem), if true in this more general setting, would help immensely. Therefore, I would like to know if the theory of symplectic orbifolds has been developed at all, and if so, where can I read about it. Again, I am mostly interested in 4-orbifolds, so even results in this dimension would help. Thank you in advance! 

Let $M$ be a compact manifold, let $\tilde{M}$ be its universal cover, and suppose that the Euler characteristic $\chi(\tilde{M})=0$. My question is: does this imply that $\chi(M)=0$? This is clear if $\pi_1(M)$ is finite, but I am interested in the case $|\pi_1(M)|=\infty$. It might not feel right, but I can't think of any counterexample, either. Thank you very much in advance! 

Let $B$ be a simply connected space, and $F\to E\to B$, $F'\to E'\to B$ two fibrations with a map $f:E'\to E$ sending fibers to fibers and inducing the identity on $B$ (in my case $f$ is injective but I don't think it matters). Let $f:B\to B'$ be a map between simply connected spaces, $F\to E\to B$ a fibration, and $F\to E'\to B'$ the pullback with respect to $f$. Here as well, I deal with $f$ being injective. 

Let $\mathbb{K}=\mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{C}$, and let $$ F=(P_1,\ldots, P_m):\mathbb{K}^n\to \mathbb{K}^m $$ be a polynomial map. I would like to know under what conditions the preimages $F^{-1}(y)$ of $F$ depend continuously on $y\in Im(F)\subset\mathbb{K}^m$, with respect to the Hausdorff topology. For example, this holds when $\mathbb{K}=\mathbb{R}$, and $P_1,\ldots P_k$ generate the algebra of polynomials invariant under the action of some compact group $G\subset O(n)$. However, I do not even know if the condition holds in the complex setting (i.e., $\mathbb{K}=\mathbb{C}$ and $G$ complex reductive group). Although my interest is closely related to the group action case, I am primarily looking for conditions on the algebra generated by $P_1,\ldots, P_n$. Any reference would be welcome! 

The result of Sion's minimax theorem can be restated as $$\min_{h_l \in X}\sup_{h_k \in Y}f(h_l,h_k) = \sup_{h_k \in Y}\min_{h_l \in X}f(h_l,h_k)$$ where $h_l$ and $h_k$ are continuous functions on $X$ and $Y$, respectively, and $f$, is then a functional. Let $$ h_l^\kappa(x) = \begin{cases} 0, &{l}(x)<\rho \\ \kappa(x), & {l}(x)=\rho\\ 1, & {l}(x)> \rho \end{cases} $$ where $l$ is a positive continuous function on a closed interval of real numbers $I$, $\kappa\in [0,1]$ is an increasing function on an interval $A=\{x:l(x)=\rho\}$, $\lambda(A)>0$, where $\lambda$ is the Lebesgue measure, and $\min_x l(x)<\rho<\max_x l(x)$ is a positive number. Let $$X=\{h_l^\kappa:\forall l,\forall \kappa\}$$ 

I think the critical point is to come up with a suitable convex curve. I cannot even guess what kind of convex curve would likely maximize the above. I am desperate even for the simplest case: $n=2$. I have the feeling that this question is rather difficult but I still would like to attack. I would be grateful in this regard for any help. 

There are two sets defined: $$\mathcal{S}_0=\left\{\{u_1,\ldots,u_n\}:\prod_{k=1}^n P_1(U_k=u_k)\leq \prod_{k=1}^n P_0(U_k=u_k)\right\}$$ $$\mathcal{S}_1=\left\{\{u_1,\ldots,u_n\}:\prod_{k=1}^n P_1(U_k=u_k)> \prod_{k=1}^n P_0(U_k=u_k)\right\}$$ and the corresponding objective function: $$R(n,(p,q))=\frac{1}{2}\left(\sum_{\{u_1,\ldots,u_n\}\in \mathcal{S}_0} \prod_{k=1}^n P_1(U_k=u_k)+\sum_{\{u_1,\ldots,u_n\}\in \mathcal{S}_1} \prod_{k=1}^n P_0(U_k=u_k)\right)$$ $2.$ The random variables $U_1,U_2,\ldots,U_n$ are not necessarily identically distributed; 

This question is about a claim given in this paper (page 261, the remark), but without any proof. It simply says that if two sets of probability distributions, $\mathscr{P}_0$ and $\mathscr{P}_1$ (each having infintely many elements and $\mathscr P_0\cap \mathscr P_1=\emptyset$ ), are constructed on some infinite set $\Omega$ in such a way that every $P_0\in\mathscr{P}_0$ is absolutely continuous with respect to a common measure $\mu_0$ and every $P_1\in\mathscr{P}_1$ is absolutely continuous with respect to a common measure $\mu_1$, then there exist no pairs $(Q_0,Q_1)\in \mathscr{P}_0\times \mathscr{P}_1$ such that $$Q_0[q_1/q_0(X)<t]\leq P_0[q_1/q_0(X)<t]\quad \forall t>0,P_0\in \mathscr P_0$$ $$Q_1[q_1/q_0(X)<t]\geq P_1[q_1/q_0(X)<t]\quad \forall t>0,P_1\in \mathscr P_1$$ Here, $q_0$ and $q_1$ are the density functions of $Q_0$ and $Q_1$, respectively. Added: I was able to disprove the claim for the general case. Here is an example: $$\mathscr P_0=\{\mathcal{N}(-0.5+b,1)|b\in [-0.5,0]\}$$ $$\mathscr P_1=\{\mathcal{N}(0.5+b,1)|b\in [0,0.5]\}$$ Then $(Q_0,Q_1)=(\mathcal{N}(-0.5,1),\mathcal{N}(0.5,1))$ satisfy the given two inequalities above. Here is the figure for the first inequality, for $b\in\{-0.4,-0.3,-0.2,-0.1,0\}$, where the blue curve is for the $Q_0$, i.e. $b=0$ 

I tried to work on the problem and I think I am able to resolve some points. Here is my work: Consider the Lagrangians: $$L_0=\int_{\mathbb{R}} g^u{f}^{1-u}\mathrm{d}\mu+\int_{\mathbb{R}}\left(\lambda_0(f-f_L)+\lambda_{00}(f_U-f)\right)\mathrm{d}\mu+\mu_0\left(\int_{\mathbb{R}} f\mathrm{d}\mu-1\right)$$ $$L_1=\int_{\mathbb{R}} g^u{f}^{1-u}\mathrm{d}\mu+\int_{\mathbb{R}}\left(\lambda_1(g-g_L)+\lambda_{11}(g_U-g)\right)\mathrm{d}\mu+\mu_1\left(\int_{\mathbb{R}} g\mathrm{d}\mu-1\right)$$ Taking the Gateux derivatives of the Lagrangians, at the direction of funtions $\psi_0$ and $\psi_1$, respectively, leads to $$\frac{\partial L_0}{\partial f}=\int\left((1-u)\left(\frac{g}{f}\right)^u+\lambda_0-\lambda_{00}+\mu_0\right)\psi_0\mathrm{d}\mu=0\quad\quad(1)$$ $$\frac{\partial L_1}{\partial g}=\int\left(u\left(\frac{g}{f}\right)^{u-1}+\lambda_1-\lambda_{11}+\mu_1\right)\psi_1\mathrm{d}\mu=0\quad\quad\quad\,\,\,(2)$$ Here according to Gateux derivative, $\psi_0$ and $\psi_1$ are arbitrary functions. I take them as integrable functions with $\int \psi_0 \mathrm{d}\mu=1$ and $\int \psi_1 \mathrm{d}\mu=1$ There are actually $3$ cases for each Lagrangian $L_0$ and $L_1$. For $L_0$ we have $$f=f_L, \quad f=f_u, \quad f_L<f<f_U$$ and for $L_1$ we have $$g=g_L, \quad g=g_u, \quad g_L<g<g_U$$ The conditions above $\partial L_0/\partial f=0$ and $\partial L_1/\partial g=0$ make sense only for the conditions $f_L<f<f_U$ and $g_L<g<g_U$. Hence, I can write the maximizing functions as $$f(y)=\begin{cases}f_L\quad y\in E_0\\ f_U\quad y\in E_1\\h_0\quad y\in E_2\\\end{cases}\quad g(y)=\begin{cases}g_L\quad y\in E_3\\ g_U\quad y\in E_4\\h_1\quad y\in E_5\\\end{cases}$$ Based on this result I have following conclusions:
