I actually always wear a backpack. I would like to get packs to put on the back of my bike. But I only have one bike and it's carbon so I will not add any pack frame to it. I did, however try my friend's messenger bag one time and it left a bruise the size of a softball on my back. I think messenger bags could be good if you have only a lunch a jacket and a notebook. But I have to carry a laptop and textbooks to school so my pack usually weighs about 25-30lbf, and I commute 25 miles a day. When I put all of my gear into the messenger bag the bag kept on slipping off my back the whole time. And, like I said, it left a nasty bruise. My back does get sweaty from backpacks, but I like them because you can secure them to you with the chest strap, and hip strap. (Sometimes when crouching over the hip strap doesn't do anything, but the chest strap is always nice to keep the pack stable.) So, bottom line, I prefer backpacks. But I can see, if you aren't carrying heavy items that a messenger bag may be preferable. 

I used my old Trek mountain bike last winter (Helsinki, down to -25C, lots of snow) for commuting to work (8km each way, roads) but it probably needs too many repairs to be worthwhile. I got a new sports hybrid thingy (Crescent Zetta) in the summer, and it might be ok for winter use with some studded tyres. It has disc brakes and 32-622 tyres. I don't know the size of the rims. I have 26" Nokian Hakkapeliitta W106 studded tyres for the mountain bike, which were very good last winter. These obviously won't fit on the Crescent's bigger 28" wheels, but the W106 also comes in 37-622 (700x35c). Would 37-622 tyres fit in place of 32-622 tyres or is it too big a difference? 

On a magazine i saw a bike with a magnificent frame. I would love to know what model it is. Maybe someone can help me. 

I think about buying a new mountainbike when sale is starting. Now my Problem is that my favorite mountainbike has only 2 chainrings with 36/26 teeth. I am used to ride with 3 chainrings and don't know if it's too hard for me to ride or if it feels like "some gears are missing" if there is one chainring less. I am just a hobby cyclist, I love to do some tours an evening rides, but just for fun. Maybe someone can explain advantages and disadvantages of 2 vs 3 chainrings. 

This happened to me with a Kryptonite Evolution lock. I locked it, went for lunch, but afterwards the key just wouldn't unlock. After hours of oil, poking bits of wire, screwdriver waggles, help from strangers, I gave up. I tried again the next day, and gave up again. In the end, I had to cut the lock with an angle grinder. Took 20 seconds tops. I took it back to the bike shop and they replaced it immediately. They said they replace about one a year on warranty. They also recommended putting a bit of oil in the lock each month to keep it working smoothly. 

I have an Ellsworth AM bike that's running a 26" rear wheel. I just scored a great deal on an x-fusion sweep fork that's 160mm travel (same as the frame) but for a 27.5 wheel. I am in search of a new wheel for it, and I wasn't sure if I would be better off running 26" wheels all around, or if I would be better off running a 27.5" wheel up front with a 26" wheel in the back. Just looking for some advice before I bite the bullet on a new wheel. Thanks! 

Note the y-axis scales do not begin at zero, to make the differences more apparent. The distance has increased slightly over the years somewhat (except 2013 where it was shortened due to heavy snowfall and bad weather). But the average speed increased in the first half of the 20th century but has levelled off in the 50 years since 1960. A similar trend can be seen in the 'Five Monuments of Cycling': 

Yes, for smaller ones. No, for full mudguards. Tour de France Here's Team Katusha using them on the ‘Paris Roubaix stage’ of the Tour de France in 2014, according to Stickybottle: 

Can someone please describe to me why there is so much hatred for these little things? I get that they kind of resemble a guy's genitalia, but I feel like it's not really that big of a deal. 

I first remember hearing hate for presta valve caps in the video where Lance Armstrong changes a bike tire. He says: 

I am a college student, in Air Force ROTC, and I bike for 1.5-3.5 hours a day. My cardio and core strength are great, but I haven't found the motivation to build my upper body. I'm a skinny build, so it will take some work. My question is: how will increased upper-body strength affect cycling, primarily all mountain and freeride type riding? On top of HOW more upper body strength affects riding, which upper-body muscles will make the biggest difference? 

UCI rules The UCI rules (PDF, 1.3.024, p.70) would likely forbid full mudguards as they would constitute a protective screen or fairing for the wheels: 

Vuelta a España They're still sponsored by them this year, here's their EDICIÓN KATUSHA 2016 for sale, blurbing: 

I use a pair of Gore-Tex trainers when it's wet. They keep my feet dry, I walk around normally with them the rest of the day. I don't have clipless pedals, but I do have toeclips which can be easily adjusted for different types of shoe. They also keep the wind off quite well when it's cold, and have been fine recently when it's been a few degrees below freezing. Sealskinz waterproof socks are quite good too, but it means you still get wet shoes and it's just easier to just have waterproof footwear. Good mudguards are also highly recommended for commuting. 

I am replacing the chain on my road bike soon. How do I know how many links to get? Does it have to exactly 114 or 116. Or is it not a big deal? I ordered a 116 link chain. Will I need to shorten it? Thank you. 

In September I got a Scott CR1 (2007 model) for my 17th birthday. It's my first road bike and I love commuting on it. Up until I got my Scott I was a strict mountain biker. So when I got my road bike I got a pair of mountain bike pedals for it since I already had the shoes. Now, after 3k miles or so, my pedals are really wearing themselves out. I want to get a pair of road bike cleats. But which ones should I start with? I don't want the "entry line" cleats but I also don't want to spend more than $150 MAX. This is what I was thinking about for the pedals and cleats. This is what I had in mind for shoes. 

You have tires you can run with really low pressure (for more traction in the snow). You can have your mountainbike frame and disc brakes. In my opinion you even don't need a suspension with such a bike, the low pressure in your tires is really enough comfort and suspension. If you ride more rural and snowy roads it can be really fun with such a bike! And actually most of the "big players" in the mountainbike sector have their own model. 

I didn't find it in the general UCI track rules, but it's in the track rules (PDF) of the UCI's World Cycling Centre in Aigle, Switzerland: 

The Internet Bike Database is built on user-submitted data and lets you list bikes by type (mountain, road, BMX and 21 other types) or by brand, and you can search for specific models, but it won't let you filter by year and gears and so on. BikePedia claims to be the "Bicycle Industry Encyclopedia" and lets you view by year and manufacturer, but again you cannot filter in the way you want.
