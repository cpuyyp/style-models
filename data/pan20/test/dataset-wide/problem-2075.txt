Since taking a job about year ago as a senior developer, I've seen my fair share of work that, let's just say, is less than stellar. The company is full of developers (for the sake of this question their name is "Joe") and Joe does things that do not follow proper procedures, break quite often and create lots of maintenance work to get running again. I'm usually the guy they go to to figure out the problem, and I can spend days trying to peel away their stupidity. Joe is not a direct report of my manager either, my manager understands my pain, but doesn't do much more than that. It's not that Joe is a bad employee, he works hard and is well respected in the company. He's just not up with the times with modern software development, and some of the key decisions he makes are making things more difficult for lots of people (not just me). I've also approached Joe before with an offer of, "Hey, have you ever seen this, you should check it out, I'll be happy to walk you through it". It was quickly rejected. I'm frustrated, because I know better ways to do these things, things that have a proven track record in my previous companies as working. I was hired to bring these ideas to my immediate group, but I'm finding my job stretches out to Joe's work as well often enough that I'm getting pretty fed up having to deal with his work. My question is, how open should I be about Joe concerning their shoddy work? Do I? 

I'm currently looking for part time work. I have been in touch with a radio company however I can't quit understand what it is they want. For example they emailed me saying: 

I have been looking for a job and had been applying through recruiters and independently. Today I was contacted by a recruiter who said I have a phone interview tomorrow, and another company emailed me asking when I’m available for a phone interview tomorrow too. I also have my normal job tomorrow in the evening/night. Also I just got a message from my landlord saying the washer and dryer are being replaced tomorrow. I’m feeling a bit overwhelmed, is there anything I can do? Is it normal to be given less than 24 hours notice for an interview? I had applied for these jobs several weeks ago and have been applying for others one’s since, so I haven’t been thinking of the one’s I have interviews with tomorrow. Considering I had applied for the job several weeks ago, it wasn't at the top of my mind and I needed the chance to re-read the job description and brush up on the company vision etc. 

This is a work culture you are not likely to overcome, and even if you do manage to work remotely, you may still be unhappy. For six years, I worked remotely 2 days a week at a company that discouraged working from home except when it was needed. How? I negotiated this up front when I was hired and they were desperate, and later when they tried to take it away, I let them know (nicely) that I'd probably be looking for another job if they pulled back this benefit. They never questioned me again about it. Perhaps the same hard-nosed attitude will work in your case. I have since switched jobs to a company that openly allows working remotely a few days a week so long as you get your work done. I can certainly say, this is a welcome relief to be in a "work-from-home" culture, than going against the culture like the first job I talked about. At my first job, you were lucky to get a conference line number to call into for meetings, usually you had to track someone down to start it up after the meeting started. At my new job every invite at my current company contains details on the conference call. We don't use our conference rooms much at work, most people would rather just talk at their desks unless we have to whiteboard. To sum it all up, If you want to work from home on a regular schedule, you will enjoy it much better under a new company that has the internal culture to support it. 

Set your own pace. Do not worry about not meeting the expectations of your manager or colleagues. Work at a pace where you do not feel stressed out but at the same time you do not slack and waste time. This is something that comes with practice. Do not be afraid that sometime in the future you may get a feedback that your pace of work does not live up to their expectations, which they have not bothered to communicate to you. If and when that happens, tell your manager that no expectation was communicated to you before that time, you need more help with locating code and any other help you need. Always follow the middle way between slacking off and stressing out when determining your pace of work. Following this middle way is much more important in the long run than any rewards you expect from working, such as praise, status, promotion, power or higher salary. Doing otherwise is like putting the cart in front of the horse; such a contraption will just become a problem for others on the road with their horses and carts in the right order. 

Request the door be locked where you have to enter a numerical code to get in, and only you and other women are provided the passcode. Problem solved. 

I would report him, and encourage others to do the same. The best case for you here is for HR to understand how volatile he has become and dismiss him immediately before his notice is up. HR may not care much about what he is saying, but they certainly should care how this is affecting the morale of other employees. 

You are on an uphill swim on this one. For six years, I worked remotely 2 days a week at a company that discouraged working from home except when it was needed. How? I negotiated this up front when I was hired and they were desperate, and later when they tried to take it away, I let them know (nicely) that I'd probably be looking for another job if they pulled back this benefit. They never questioned me again about it. Perhaps the same hard-nosed attitude will work in your case. I have since switched jobs, and I can say, it's so much nicer to work in a "work-from-home" culture, than going against the flow like the first job I talked about. 

I’m getting my degree in computer science and have tested out several different positions in companies through the co-op program. It’s been my observation that I like support or help desk related work. Things I like about it are - Interacting with people - Variety of tasks and challenges - High volume and sometimes high pressure - Get to see results of my work I’m good at it (according to myself and performance reviews) Correct me if I’m wrong, but many of these things don’t apply to other technical roles (such as developers). The problem is help desk is pretty low level (I’m only doing it now as a part time gig). The pay is low and it’s generally seen as an entry level position. I told this to my co-op advisor and he said I could become a help desk manager. Question. Is it wrong to be concerned that a position you enjoy is not suitable for the long term as it’s a dead end? The old adage “to do what you like and not worry about money” seems like an over simplification. Are there other more advance positions like help desk? I know IT may have some of these features but I’ve had experience where IT just receives a few tickets a day to deploy a new VM through vSphere and this was really boring. 

You should give a standard 2-week notice, and leave it at that. You may just get lucky and they'll immediately escort you out and pay you anyway, freeing you to take Job 2. You may think your industry is huge, but don't burn bridges unless you have good reason too. At the end of the day, this is "you", so don't ruin your reputation over two weeks. 

The fact this is the third programmer in recent history you've tried to hire makes me think more of the problem lies with you, and not the person you hired. I personally don't see any problem with what the new developer is doing, so long as it's not interfering with deadlines. You can always make changes tomorrow to make your job easier, but it's what is due today that matters. Since he's new to this code, he wants to protect his butt with improvements and tests by not delivering changes that break something important. I wouldn't call that being a "Smart ass", that's just being smart. If a building contractor took over a project and noticed the foundation weak and the building was eventually going to crumble, would you expect him to fix it, or just finish the building to spec. You hired this guy to take over this project, right? So let him take it over! Both you and your buddy (Programmers A and B) no longer wanted to work on this project, you got what you wanted, a third developer. Let him make it his masterpiece, and you'll likely have a long term employee. Nit pick every little thing he does, and look forward to taking back this project in the near future when he quits, like the two former employees did. If I were speaking to the new developer, I would stress he needs to "sell" his ideas, not force his ideas upon his new management. Get everyone in the same room, state the problem, state the likely outcome if said problem isn't corrected. State your proposed solution, and your timeline for getting it implemented without affecting company deadlines. Just some advice from a seasoned developer... 

The code bases of almost all software developed in corporations are a mess. This is because human thinking process is not crisp and clear as it is usually considered to be, but it is quite muddled most of the time. The clarity of the thought process is easily degraded by emotions and moods distinct from the thinking process itself. For example, the code developed by someone after an argument with the boss will invariably be worse than the code s/he develops when in a good mood. The attitude of management and therefore the environment in most corporations is such that it puts the people who have the actual skills to develop any product in a bad mood a lot of the time. Thus most code is developed when in a not so good mood and so it is messy. In fact, as a software developer you can expect yourself to be stuck neck deep in messy code most of your time. Being a software engineer is not very different from being a sanitation engineer. Do not start your day with the expectation of dealing with clean, sensible code. Repeat in your mind several times the following before you start your work day: 

I had applied for a job through a website. Today I got an email saying "Hi JoeT, thanks for the interest. Please apply for the position at $URL$ (enter a keyword)" I go to this website but it's a directory listing for a whole bunch of jobs and I don't know which company it was that sent me this email. Since the email addressed is anonymized through I can't get any information from it. I can reply to the email, but what exactly should I say? I don't want to come off lazy not having searched through the job posing list but I've applied for so many jobs and the email gave no indication which company it was for. 

Team leads in software development in corporations are invariably like that. Team leads tend to be relatively young and therefore have not had the time to mature in their roles. They tend to be caught between the manager(s) and the other team members, and combined with their own ambition, their stress levels are high. They are effectively new to their roles and are in a condition very similar to your own. Depend less on the team lead and approach the other developers in your team as much as possible for help. 

Learn the code base in small chunks, that is, do not expect to be able to understand the entire code base in a short time. Try to understand small parts of it, such as all the code for a few relatively simple features of the application. This can be made easier by working on bug investigation and fixing for the first few weeks in a large project rather than jumping into developing new code right away. You may want to talk to your team lead or manager about this. 

and there's no further details. I'm also unclear if this is a paid or volunteer position; or a one time thing or a part time job or a full time job etc. I know these people are nontechnical and want someone to help them with their computers, but it's hard to be able to say if I can do the job without knowing what the job is. How should I proceed? I can't think of the words to ask them what they actually want. They didn't have a job posting (that I saw), I was put in touch with them through email, by networking.
