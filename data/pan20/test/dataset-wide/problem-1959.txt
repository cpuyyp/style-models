Possibly, but I would recommend against it. Using a non-standard or offbeat element in a resume is kind of like the essay in a college application: if it is brilliant, it can make the difference in an acceptance, but for everybody else it only hurts them. What you are up against is that a graphic is "stylistic", so if it rubs the reviewer the wrong way, it will be a drawback no matter how good it is. You make squares, the reviewer likes circles; there is no way to control for that kind of problem. Also, anything non-standard may seem "wierd" to the reviewer. Wierd is usually not the impression you want to make with a resume. Special graphics and formatting may work well in a resume, but as a general rule you will have better chance of success leaving that kind of thing out. 

There is no reason for you to try to force everyone to use git. Let people adopt it as they see fit. Our company which is small has an SVN server and a git server and project managers can choose which one they want to use. Arbitrarily forcing people to use tools you favor is a morale-busting move. Don't do it. Also, as I am sure you are aware git is significantly more complex than SVN because it is a peer-to-peer system. That is great if you are doing a highly diversified open source project. But for simple, top-down projects with a single manager, the extra flexibility git provides is largely superfluous. I use git for my own personal hobby projects because I bounce around a lot from different computers, but at work I continue to use SVN because it is a more simple model and at work we have zero need for peer-to-peer functionality. In fact, for the projects at work I do not want git because creating private repositories is exactly what I DON'T want people doing. 

You have two basic options: cut your losses now, or decide the spelling mistakes are worth putting up with on an ongoing basis. It is way, way too late to "train" somebody to become a good speller. You learn that stuff when you are 13-years-old. I see 40-year-old "programmers" where I work typing with two fingers. There are certain things best learned when young and it is a mistake to try to teach an old dog new tricks. Feel free to waste your time and money trying to do that and proving it to yourself. 

If an employer uses a third party to do a background check, they potentially have a FCRA liability. If you get fired as a result of a background problem but they do not notify you of the results of the background check before firing you, then it is potentially an FCRA violation and you may have grounds to sue the employer. If a violation has occurred then a court, under the law may award up to $1,000, even if no harm has taken place. If you have been harmed, which being fired would be a harm, then the damages are potentially unlimited depending on the degree to which you may have been financially harmed by the action. You can obviously consult with an attorney that specializes in employment law to get more information about your legal options. 

Sign it. Make sure they give you a copy of the complete, signed document (signed by both parties). Go to a public notary. In the presence of the notary, write at the bottom (or the back of the document): "This document was executed Thursday, July 21, 2016, [or whatever enter today's date]" and sign this note and have the notary seal it. This is proof the document was executed on a day other than it was dated. A contract with a false date is invalid. If they ever sue you for disclosure using that NDA, bring your notarized version to court and show the judge and tell him/her that the document was backdated. The case will be dismissed. This procedure will make your employer happy and nullify any possibility that the NDA could be used against you in the future. The other answers are either legally incorrect or suggest courses of action which would needlessly annoy your employer and compromise your standing at your company. To jeopardize your employment according to the advice in the other answers would be foolhardy. 

You could do any of your stated options, focus on math, CS or both as you wish. If you are not already studying those fields, you may find it difficult to compete with other students who may have been studying those subjects actively since childhood. Big data involves more statistics than calculus, so I would recommend studying statistics and logic over other forms of mathematics. 

You need to carefully decide what you want to accomplish. If you want her to work harder, that is probably a forlorn hope. If you want her to stop challenging you and be more deferential, that is probably achievable. If you want her to not be bad mouthing you to the other employees, that is definitely doable. Just be perfectly clear with yourself what you want to achieve. As far as respect is concerned, the next time she gives you back talk, take the next private opportunity to bring it up with her. "Sasha, in the meeting yesterday you were being kind of hard on me." Use humor and be lightweight, just let her know you expect more action and less talk. Note that often when a boss has a problem like this, it is an indication that THEY are talking to much. Personally, I give all my orders via extremely explicit emails so I never get backtalk ever, except in written form. Be wary of yaking at people. A good boss minimizes chatter. As far as her maneuvering against you socially, this is only possible because you are alienating other employees so they are receptive to what she is saying. If you arrange things so that other employees depend on Sasha, then you win both ways. If she supports them, then she is doing her job. If she lets them down, then you win socially because they will form a dislike of her and stop listening to her calumnies. Either way you win. The only way to lose is to just boss everybody around while not backing anybody up. In that kind of environment a weasel will flourish. 

Once you accept a written offer, you should no longer conduct interviews with other employers. If you have not accepted a written offer, you are free to interview with whom you want in good conscience. 

When you have somebody with problems usually punishing them just makes it worse. I think some companies punish workers in the hope that they quit, so they won't have to go through the difficulty of firing them. It is not my philosophy, but I understand why other people do it. Your steps so far seem reasonable to me. The key thing is to make sure that it is clear exactly what you expect. I recommend writing emails that are extremely explicit and spell out with no question exactly what you want him do, down to specifying functions and parameters. If he is not doing stuff, visit him, tell him to bring up the email on the screen so you both can read it. Ask him, "Did you read this email?" Don't ask why he didn't get stuff done, you will just get excuses. Excuses are worthless. Also, questioning of that kind could be construed as "rubbing his nose in it". You don't want to create a hostile or antagonistic atmosphere. The key thing is that he understands perfectly what you expect to have done and by when. The goal here is to make sure he understands that he is underperforming. At the end of the day you are going to have some workers that are not good, so eventually you either need to lower your expectations or get rid of them.
