I don't see any reason why you would ever turn down a raise unless it also comes with a different title or responsibilities. In the latter case it might make sense to turn it down because you wouldn't want them to spend time/resources training you only to have you leave a couple weeks later. However, if it's just a raise by itself then you should absolutely accept even if it doesn't result in any additional pay (you leave before it takes effect). 

As others have said: honesty is the best option in this situation, you don't want to have it seem like you're covering something up or hiding something. Just explain what you did (and why) and then ask how you should have handled the situation differently in the future. The other reason I'm adding this answer is this: when there is a situation in a work environment where you have something (or have access to something) that you aren't supposed to... NEVER delete, alter or otherwise touch anything. The very first thing you need to do is contact your supervisor and/or security manager and inform them that you have "spillage" and that they need to investigate/resolve the situation. It is extremely important that you take no action so that they have the ability to assess the situation as you found it. Your mistake here wasn't your intention, it was the fact that you acted without instruction in a potential security breach. Information security is one of the single most important areas these days, and while I'm not trying to make you nervous you should understand that companies take that stuff extremely seriously. 

In your question you seem to separate self-criticism and constructive criticism. These two things are not mutually exclusive. Self-criticism is the source. Constructive criticism is only one type of criticism. I would think, like Edwin mentioned, 

Our company was recently acquired by a large MNC. We recently started the same practice. They are called "Employee Engagement Surveys" or something of the like. The survey should be anonymous since the company just wants to get a feel for how engaged the employees are while they're at work. The idea is that the more enthusiastic the employees are, the better work they do. The intention behind the surveys is for honesty from the employees. If they truly want honesty, the survey will be anonymous. If they give the front of being anonymous and come to you later and say "I noticed you said 'bad place to work, payment bad.' Would you care to go into further detail?" then I would say to brush up your CV. I know I wouldn't want to work somewhere that put that kind of practice in place. Find out if the survey is anonymous. Just bring it up politely with your manager. Say something like "I was wondering if you could give me some more general information about the surveys. I don't need to know the questions, just how you plan on using them." Be honest, but keep it professional. Even if the survey is truly anonymous, a rant will set off red flags for the management team and they will start looking for the trouble-maker in the office. 

Unless there is a VERY good reason why you can't make it earlier (something such as having children you are responsible for dropping off at certain times) then I think it's an extremely bad idea to ask to reschedule. Particularly since it's only an hour earlier than your normal start time, are you really saying that you can't go to bed and get up one hour earlier for an interview? Frankly, if I was the interviewer in that situation your resume would immediately go in the "pass" pile even if you were otherwise a stellar candidate, because someone with rigid and unflexible schedules/routines are far more difficult to work with. Without knowing more about your situation (why the time is a big deal) it's hard to give advice, but I'd strongly suggest you sit down and evaluate why a start time prior to 9:30 is a big deal... because it really shouldn't be. I'm a night owl myself, I'd much rather be up until 2-3am and sleep until 10~ than be up early. Yet I still drag myself out of bed at 5:30 every morning for work even on days I stay up too late and don't get "enough" sleep, because that's the schedule I work and I value being a good (and reliable) employee more than my "preferred" sleep schedule. Also, getting off earlier in the day is super convenient... 

That is in no way cheating. Most companies encourage it. You don't have to identify him as your friend. Just tell the manager of the department that is hiring that you have someone you would like to refer for the position, and ask who you should speak with in HR. 

Absolutely. Contact whomever is in charge of getting your review to you. Taking 5 weeks to get an internship review done seems a bit excessive to me. Just keep your tone professional on the call. 

Speaking as a former server, this isn't bad. Restaurants operate in a much different fashion than other businesses. When you go home is relative to the amount of business. My schedule only listed in-times and not out-times. I never knew exactly when I'd be off. Sometimes I would be out early if we were slow, sometimes I stayed as late as the closing servers (along with two or three others). The trial shift could be likened to a technical interview or a programming exercise. Think of it as a technical screening. They are looking for new wait-staff that either have experience or raw talent that can be honed into the type of employee they are looking for. Take what they said at face value. I would say wait until Thursday before you call them and see where they stand in the interview process. Also, ask for the manager that was on duty during your trial shift if they are available. If not, ask for the store manager. When you do call them, make sure it is on their down time. Down time depends on the type of restaurant, but for a dinner-heavy service, I would say 2:00 - 3:00 PM is a good time frame. That makes sure that they are fully out of any lunch rush and well ahead of any dinner rush. 

The point I'm driving at here is you still need to differentiate yourself from other candidates, and the number one thing for many companies is your ability to communicate. I'm currently a software developer, but I spent a decade working in sales/management and if I were hiring today I would MUCH rather an average programmer with excellent communication skills and a good attitude than a "rockstar" programmer with middling communication and a bad attitude. 

I have a number of things to say so I'm going to attempt to make this as brief as possible, but this is a complex topic so I apologize if this gets lengthy. Before I begin: It is extremely unlikely that employers are "discriminating" by indicating that they want good written and verbal communication skills. While there may be some people out there doing that, it's honestly pretty ridiculous to imply that it's discrimination and I'll explain why in a moment. Ok, so let's break this down a bit and look at a few factors I think you're overlooking: 1) Being a native speaker or fluent in a language has almost nothing to do with being able to communicate effectively. I know plenty of incredibly intelligent, native English-speaking people who can't clearly and concisely convey an idea to someone with a lower-level understanding. Which brings me to my next point... 2) Just because a job isn't a sales/customer-facing position doesn't mean the ability to communicate is less important. There are multiple facets of communication and being able to speak to strangers and empathize with people (sales) has basically nothing to do with being able to convey ideas and concepts effectively. One of the most critical aspects of a software development position is the ability to work with team members, analysts and customers to identify and resolve issues. If you can't explain technical information or relate concerns effectively then you're going to waste valuable time re-discussing or even worse re-developing things because there was a lack of communication. 3) Frankly, I think IT is one of the most diverse fields you could discuss and that out of all the possible things you could complain about discrimination shouldn't be very high on the list. I've worked with people of all genders and nationalities, both in person and through online collaboration. If anything the stereotypical Asian/Indian engineer you often see in media/advertising is an indication that discrimination isn't a major issue. 

My email client has a signature option. I don't put anything at the bottom, I just let the signaure handle it. Most of us in our office have something nice and generic like "Regards," for ours. 

I agree with everything Andreas said in his answer. It sounds like it's time to put him on a performance improvement plan. Set up a meeting with your student. Lay guidelines for him. And from here on out document everything regarding his performance. Maybe part of his plan should include the revocation of some benefits... like working from home. His time sheet may say 10 hours a day, but his deliverables beg to differ. You can still be supportive of him during this time. Let him know that you are disappointed with his progress so far instead of angry that he's not getting his work done. Let him know that if he really wants an internship with your organization, he's going to have to step up his game. 

I think I have an idea as to what you're looking for. Don't just do your work, analyze your work. Be a student of the game as they say. Look at the whole picture not just the task at hand. Your boss said: 

Start at the beginning. Is there a version control system that you use to maintain your source code? If there is, does everyone follow the same procedure to access a file? If not, why not? Is there documentation regarding the code you're writing? Is it a bug fix, feature request, in-house tool? Who generates those documents? Is there a process flow of information regarding the code? Instead of just taking an assignment and completing it, find out where your assignment fits in with the bigger picture of the project or application being developed. What processes did/do you use to complete your tasks? Is there a more effective/efficient way to complete them? 

As for your experience with interviewing: I think that you're attempting to rationalize to yourself why you weren't selected, and if I had to guess I'd say it's because you're either overestimating the relative strength of your qualifications or your resume isn't doing a good job of highlighting why you're a strong candidate for the positions. As another poster said: you're not being passed over for having a foreign sounding name in a field where a TON of companies are outsourcing IT services overseas and everywhere you look in the online community are developers of all races and nationalities. That's what I meant when I said it was a little ridiculous to imply, because I don't think you could pick another field that's as diverse or forward-thinking. I would suggest that you try to keep an open mind about things and not be too quick to dismiss the importance of them. IT is a good field to be in, but just like a college education... it's not a magic bullet. There has been tremendous job growth over the past 20 years, but there has also been an explosion of people getting educated in the field. Some people seem to think you can't look without bumping into countless opportunities, but that just isn't realistic. 

Try scheduling a meeting with your boss. Drop him an email asking for a short meeting to talk about your progress to date. See how things are going, where things are heading. 

You can always ask. If there's no ink to paper there's room for negotiation. Ask for what you see as fair value for your services. Write up your own contract and see what they say. Maybe even make it a joint venture. Draw up a rough draft for ideas you have and take it to them. Ask them "Is this something similar to what you had in mind?" 

I'd say he needs you more than you need him at this point. The coding and deployment process may be outside your scope, but he needs the coaching regardless. Maybe you should explain the consequences of his actions to him. Lay out exactly what his poor coding / deployment processes do to damage his business. You mentioned that he is a co-founder. If you can, talk to the other co-founder(s) and see where you can get with that approach. 

Find out how much the current process costs the organization now, both quantitatively and qualitatively. (Labor hours, labor dollars, organizing file structure for finding reports, etc) Find out how much your new set up will cost the organization (hardware, software, your time building reports and setting up the new report server) Figure out how long it will take to pay off the new configuration. (By saving $X per day, week, month, this will pay itself off in Y weeks, months, years).
