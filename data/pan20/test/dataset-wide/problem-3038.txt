The delayed the start of the war allowed winter to interrupt the German invasion, ultimately preventing defeat. That showing that Germany was the aggressor split the German/British/capitalist alliance, and even causing the counter-intuitive US/British/Soviet alliance. Molotov states that receiving material help from the US was unthinkable in the 1930s, and that only Stalin could have conceived of this plan. 

How much popular support was there in the Soviet Union? How did this popular support increase and decrease with time? Here is an infographic that sort of summarizes my question. It shows that even at the point of collapse, some 70% of Soviet citizens supported the continued governance by the communist party within the Soviet Union. However, I have doubts about the validity of this information. Also, this only shows a single year, not how popular attitudes increased and decreased as the years passed. What does scholarly research say about this? 

There is no general answer; each reason has its own answer. Japan has a high population density and limited arable land, so the evolution of a mega-city like Tokyo with skyscrapers is a technical solution to a national challenge. Singapore and Hong Kong have a limited amount of land; the only option for increasing space was to grow up. China is undergoing urbanization right now; housing must be built for all the rural residents who are migrating to the cities. China also has central planning, and for several reasons, favors the construction of large, densely populated cities instead of suburban sprawl. It is interesting to travel from Beijing out of the city for example, just a moment passes and there are only farms and villages. For Taipei and Kuala Lumpur, I am not so familiar with the real estate dynamics. I think in Europe - Germany, for example - the growth of small towns was more prevalent when urbanization occurred. I don't know much about European Urbanization plans, but I think the distribution of political control was such that smaller cities were favored over large cities. 

In high school in the US, we generally learned that until Europeans started sailing the world, with Vasco Da Gama and Christopher Columbus, there was no long distance sailing. The impression I got was that Europeans were the first to figure out how to explore, and how to trade, and how to sail. This is not correct; many traders vied the seas for centuries before the "Age of Exploration". In relation to your question, the Indian Ocean Trade Routes began millenia before the European expansion. It certainly preceded the existence of Christianity and Islam. This is how Hinduism arrived in Indonesia - through trade with the seafaring Hindu regions. There have been finds of Roman coins in Kerala, as well as Chinese coins from the Tang Dynasty. The proximity of Kerala to the Middle East, and the presence of Tang Dynasty coins in Kerala from the time of rapid Muslim expansion provides us a clue of how Islam spread to Indonesia. Please note that the Tang Dynasty (618 - 907) and the Muslim expansion (622 - 750) occurred at the same time. It is also notable that Kerala has a large Muslim population as well as an ancient (apostolic?) Christian population. The Kerala christians are so ancient that it is said that one of Christ's apostles, St Thomas, founded their church. I have photos from a museum in Fijian where they show architectural art from Christian, Muslim, Jain, and Hindu temples that were established by merchant communities. ( I will post them here later) They often show a blending of Chinese, Indian, and Middle Eastern art. The contents of the museum were dated to about 700 C.E.; from when the Tang dynasty was very cosmopolitan and before the persecutions by Tang Emperor Wuzong. There was also a tremendous mixing of peoples in China during 618 - 845; many of which arrived by sea in Quanzhou, a famous ancient port city in SE China. So, How did Islam arrive in Indonesia? I think Tom Au's answer gives a nice set of details. The thrust of my answer is more general; my point is that considering the level of trade and mixing of peoples during this era through the Indian Ocean, it should not be at all surprising that Islam is in Indonesia, SE Asia, and China. Specifically, The middle east traded with Kerala, and Kerala and Tamil traders passed Indonesia on the way to China. As this whole area was well civilized at this time, the spread of a civilized religion is not at all surprising. 

Nope! There is nowhere that the British did not touch with war. As a last ditch attempt, I thought perhaps Antarctica would have been spared - as there are no people to fight! But no, the Nazis were there too, and the British bombed them. Greenland? Nope, part of Denmark. Madagascar? Nope, WWII Campaign. Islands in the Pacific? Nope, colonies everywhere. Central Asia? Nope, part of Russia. Africa? Nope, all colonized by various European powers. I though maybe because Ethiopia wasn't initially colonized, but Nope, that was part of Italy, which the British fought during WWII. That just leaves the moon and other extra-terrestrial areas. 

Gained a foot-hold in small cites, like Surat. Extract rent from locals to pay Moguls in return for local control. Extract more rent to ship to London. Induce local "balance of payments" deficit, ruining local economy. Economic issues spread to neighboring localities. When neighboring localities stop payments to moguls, offer to moguls to collect rent. Invade with military hired from impoverished locals who need to feed their families. Control new area, return to step 2 

TED's answer is fantastic; it covers the root causes of the problems. I'd like to add one more cause, specifically, US military and economic intervention in Central and South America have acted to keep these countries poor. Edit: The new answer by Luís Henrique provides a ton of detail. Some examples, working from South to North: 

In 1980 (and today too), many people still remembered the misery of pre-1949; Mao and the CCP brought stability, security, and economic growth to China. The 120 year threat of foreign invasion was done, WWII was done, the civil was was done. Hospitals were being build, modernization was taken at full speed. This was a major accomplishment, all while maintaining territorial integrity. The fact is, the people remember these accomplishments. The fact that you, and American propaganda, don't like him is an emphasis on the Great Leap forward and the Cultural revolution. Most conversations I have had with people who lived through these horrible events blamed Mao and the CCP directly for them. But they also maintained that things were still much better in 1965 than before 1949; and in the 1980s they continues to revere Mao. I've spent a considerable amount of time in China. In the Town I live in (Population ~ 1 million) I have seen large organized protests. They are common even! How, do you think, are they dispersed? Easy - the mayor comes out after a couple days, asks what the problem is, the people tell him, and he makes a policy change to make them happy. For example, there was a neighborhood about to be eminent domained. Most people are happy to be eminent domained as they really cash out - but this neighbor hood wanted to be continue. The 30 people when to hang out in front of city hall for 5 days, then the mayor came out, and a few hours later the problem was solved. In summary Despite the stereotypes, Chinese people are not obedient drones who obey the government; they make decisions about their own future based on their observations. Mao was very popular in the 1980s, and it was not possible to remove him from public affection. Deng could fix the historical record about the GLF and CR, but did not convince everyone to dislike a popular figure. 

There is a bunch of information available about deforestation problems in Japan. See this article for an introduction: Japan - How Japan Saved its Forests: The Birth of Silviculture and Community Forest Management Basically, Japanese population grew to fast, and they used more wood then they have. By the 1600's this caused erosion problems and ensuing food problems. They were, however, able to identify and rectify the problem. I suggest reading Modern East Asia: An Integrated History for a broader view of what caused the problem, how it was resolved, and how it impacted both Japan and East Asia as a whole, and the worldwide economy. Very fascinating. Specifically, during the Ming Dynasty (1368–1644) China imported had a lot of demand for Silver. Japan for many years exported Silver to China, but in the 1500s deforestation caused a lack of fuel which impacted the price Japan's silver exports. The increased price of Silver from Japan allow new world silver to be a competitive on a price basis, leading directly to the growth of Spanish colonial might. (It was exported from the west coast of Mexico by the Spanish to Spanish Philippines, they traded by Chinese expatriate merchants through Guangzhou.) This had a huge impact on World development. In a few word, if Japan had managed its forest resources better in 1350 - 1650, there European colonial expansion in the new world would have been much weaker.

Summary: It is really hard to eat Japanese, Korean, and Chinese food with a fork and spoon Details: China, Japan, and Korea serve formal meals "family style" in small pieces. Family style means that the food is served in the middle of the table, and everyone eats together off the same plate. The small pieces will break apart if you pierce them with a fork, and eating them is awkward with a spoon. A chop stick, on the other hand, can easily grab a single small item and bring it to your mouth without making a mess. For example, look at this sushi plate: 

There is some thought that is was a ergot fungus that was the caused of the mayhem. The idea is this: The poor people had to plant their crops in swamps and substandard lands, and the rye contracted this fungus. People ate the fungus, and hallucinated and had a bunch of strange behavior. Viewing the witch trials as a drug filled rage gives it a different perspective than the fictionalized version by Authur Miller. 

When I was a kid, I heard anecdotal stories from the older generation about German POWs that were held in Wisconsin in the United States towards the end WWII. It is my understanding that they were well fed and received good medical attention. I don't know where the camps were, or what the inside was actually like, but I recall these stories: 

This question includes a classic stereo type about Chinese people - that they are subservient and obedient to the whim and whimsy of government rule. People loved Mao - and they still revere him today. A simple diktat from the government would not cause everyone to instantaneous change their minds. In the early 1980's, historian and scholars - with Deng's approval - changed the official interpretation of Mao's 2 big mistakes. The Great Leap Forward and the Cultural revolution came to be reported as what they were - horrible tragedies, and mistakes caused primarily by Mao. Is that de-Maoization? Or factual historical revision? Between about 1800 and 1949, China, and the Chinese people had a ton of chronic problem. Mao and the CCP effectively ended the problems and restored a drug free economically growing stability. I'll list the problems that were in memory: 

It has been described to me that Europe only has one language, from Lisbon to Moscow, and it changes dialect very slowly as you progress. Supposedly, the borders don't matter so much. This probably was true back in the day (~1800) with a bunch of exceptions (Basque? Greece?). Since then, some European countries ( for example, Spain, France, Florence ) have attempted to standardize their languages, but the intra-country language variation still exists. Thus, the language spoken in Bas Rhin was very similar to that which is spoken in Baden. Both were somewhat different from the languages of Paris and Berlin. This local similarity continues today. This means, altogether, that the reason German and French are different is because Paris is a significant distance from Germany. 

In Debt, the first 5000 years Graeber talks about how in England and Scotland for much of the 1800's, cash payments to manufacturing employees were irregular. To get them through months of non-payment, Graeber says people were expected to steal scrap and the the product of manufacture in order to get by. Meanwhile, tavern owners, grocers, and others have to put most of the purchases by employees on a tab. The lack of cash in society was ameliorated by strong relationships. When regular cash payments started in earnest in the 1900s, employers stopped looking the other way and security increased, preventing the "theft" of scrap and manufactured products. 

The Yuan dynasty went from ~1270-~1370, so this huge population loss is during this same time. All these deaths are not entirely attributable to the plague, hence the disclaimer phrase "to a certain extent". Note that its a 50% population loss, and a population loss of this extent leads to huge social instability. 

Qing dynasty after 1800 was too corrupt to handle difficult problems The powerful English Navy supported drug dealers selling opium in China, and undermined much of Chinese society by forcing an open market on drugs, while undermining the Chinese economy through trade imbalance. European incursions to take colonial prize cities The Taiping revolt The first Japanese -Chinese war in 1895 Russia territorial expansion in the 1860s Russian claims in historical Manchu provinces Multinational suppression of the boxer rebellion Many famines Instability after the fall of the Qing Drug dealing warlords controling large portions of Chinese territory The corrupt Foreign-sponsored GMD government in collusion with financeers Japanese invasion during WWII. 

In 1991, the Soviet Union held a referendum about its future political structure. The results of that referendum are presented in this inforgraphic, or here. What was the purpose of this referendum? Was this referendum about the continuation of governance by the communist party? If there such a positive response to the questions, why did the Soviet Union break up anyways? 

I think this is a question of wearing European/Western blinders. For example, there were significant differences in governance between Qin (Brutal Legalism) and Han (Confucius) dynasties, and even more between the Han (Agrarian Economy) and Tang (Cosmopolitan, International Commercial Economy) dynasties. Tang and Yuan were different, as were Ming and Qing. The late Song can even be said to have been governed very similarly to the US today - wealthy business elites were very entwined with the political classes, and made many decisions about governance that were primarily interesting in self-enrichment of the elites, to the degradation of the lives of normal people. (I need to find the books I read about these topics; completely forgot the names.) Even more differences in governance methods were present during the 3 kingdoms period, and the bunch of dynasties that occurred in North China between the Tang and Yuan. European political structure names don't exist for the differences, and European political theories don't readily adapt to well either. To seriously discuss the changes in Chinese governance methods for the last 2500 years, one would need to discard cultural biases and perform historical and political research from the ground up. To my knowledge, there is no single source where this occurs, nor any non-Chinese study that names the different governance changes. It is a good idea to discard the commonly held notion that Chinese governance - and society at large - was unchanged for millennia. It is also a good idea to investigate how a society actually functions rather than make comparative assumptions (A good book about this ). Having personally seen the responsiveness of civic leaders in the PRC to demands made by protesters a few years ago was a real eye opener. In the US, these people would have been tear gassed, beaten, and arrested. I witnessed the local leadership trying to find a solution to the problem, and changing their methods to suit the people.(Certainly it doesn't always end this way, but as an American, nice to see the no tear gas or nightsticks deployed.) It is somewhat ironic when I return to the US to have people ask me what it's like to be in a non-democratic country. 

British Empire armies the world over were natives. India is an important example. Indian troops were important in British colonial expansion to China during the Opium wars, and marched a long distance to fight the Ottoman Empire during world war I. There were even plans to have them march all the way to Germany, as they were highly skilled. As people the world over are just about the same, there is no reason this would not apply in the African colonies. (It is well known that Africa was one of the first places to become civilized, in Egypt) The British had a method of colonial expansion that followed a simple algorithm [1]:
