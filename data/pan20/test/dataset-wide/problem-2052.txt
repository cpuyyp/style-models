That's your worst case scenario? I guess I could imagine a few that were far worse, but let's go with your assumption. If that's truly the worst case that you want to avoid, then don't accept this job even if offered. Don't accept a job from a company you believe is hiring you because you are "a new grad with a decent skill set and good potential who wants a low pay". Selling yourself as a "cheap hire" is almost certain to bring about your worst case. Work hard to find another job, and this time don't tell them that you are okay with $35/hour. Only accept an offer you are willing to live with for at least a year. Ask about the company's annual salary review policy to determine when you might be eligible for an increase, if you deserve one. (In the US most employers have annual raises. Many lump them all together and do reviews and raises for everyone at the same time.) Then work really hard and show the company how much you are worth. Stop trusting self-reporting sites like glassdoor as an indication of what you should be making (now or after 6 months). They aren't accurate, and have no real relevance for your specific situation. Stop measuring yourself against how much you suspect others are being paid. Get a salary that works for you - without regard to what works (or doesn't work) for others. These steps will go a long way toward avoiding what you view as a worst case scenario. 

Only you can decide if this sort of disagreement is healthy and if you should tolerate this sort of behavior or not. If I were you, I'd sit down with the hiring manager, explain what you are seeing, explain how these issues have happened in the past, make your recommendations, and then ask if she/he wants to pull the offer, or go ahead. Be prepared to support the hiring manager once the decision has been made - it's really not HR's role to squash hires unilaterally over this sort of thing. If the decision is made to withdraw the offer, go through the process of writing up the approach you will take and communicate it with the hiring manager, and any other relevant stakeholders. You want to make sure you are on the same page before dropping the bomb on this candidate. Then withdraw the offer formally, and handle the resulting flashback (if any). And if the decision is made to go ahead anyway, you may want to schedule a discussion with the manager and new employee (once hired) to go over policies, and to hint that long-term whining about them isn't productive. Longer term, you might want to review your screening and interviewing practices, in order to prevent making offers to problematic employees in the first place. Brainstorm how you could have prevented the prior cases, and in particular this one. You don't want to get in the habit of pulling offers. That can ruin a company's reputation quickly. 

Go to the meeting and listen to what is said. If it doesn't come up, then ask if not having a regular schedule of students is typical or not. And if you conclude that this kind of sporadic schedule doesn't meet your needs, find a new job that does, then leave this one. While looking for a new job, ask specifically during interviews about the kinds of hours you can expect to receive. 

It's reasonable to be frustrated. But certainly the company is free to change internal hiring policies any time they like and apply it to ongoing situations. (The only exceptions would be if this were done in order to be illegally discriminatory or if union rules were in effect. I'm assuming neither is actually the case.) It would be reasonable for you to appeal to the hiring manager and/or HR for an exception in your case, since you were already in process when the policy change occurred. If the new manager really wants you badly enough, then you might have an ally. But unfortunately, timing is everything and these things happen. If you can't be moved now, talk to the hiring manager and ask if you can try again at your 1-year mark. 

Assuming you aren't stealing passwords, then I see nothing illegal here. Storing login times and login attempts is pretty standard practice for many systems. Most of those details may already be available in web server or application logs anyway. Importing them into a database may just make them easier to query and use. Sometimes such details are used to find out what is happening when under hacker or denial-of-service attack. The details and numbers may even be required for auditing and/or billing purposes. (For questions about legality in your particular locale, consult a lawyer) 

No. You don't really know what this is about. It's likely not such a huge deal. No need to bother your boss or colleagues about it. Maybe they would become jealous, or maybe they would become concerned for you. Either way, it's not their business. Just go and enjoy your lunch. 

All communication requires at least two people. You are one of those two or more. If you aren't able to ask clarifying questions of the person who held your position previously, you simply need to find others with the relevant knowledge and/or documentation. Read all documentation, requirements, specs, emails, etc. Look at all existing code. Ask questions of the people who can provide the answers. That might include Developers, Business Analysts, Project Managers, your Boss, and even the client. Don't wait to be fed knowledge - go out and grab it yourself. 

You can always ask. Be prepared to explain how you didn't realize that you had to pay for medical benefits. Clearly this will make you look a bit foolish, but so be it - if this is important for your family, you don't have much choice. Be prepared to ask for whatever you would like the company to do. Have in mind a number that would financially allow you to stay with the company. And don't get greedy - only ask for what you truly need (sometimes we need to make tough choices, you might opt to skip vision and dental coverage until you are in a better position financially). It's possible the company will give you a raise, offer to pay for some of your benefits for a while, give you an advance on next July's raise, or come to some other accommodation for you. Of course it's also possible that the company will not do anything. 

It not an unreasonable thing to do, but it depends on the culture of your workplace. In some workplace cultures not sharing with everyone would be considered rude. ("Did you bring enough for everyone?" might be asked). If you placed food in the middle, would other "islands" feel free to help themselves? If so, then your tactics may not be effective. In many shops, the norm is to place the food in a common area such as a kitchen, and let people help themselves. You can give your team an edge by sending them an email that food is there so that they can be "first in line" to get some. If you truly want to make sure each member of your island gets some, then divide the food into pieces, put it on plates, and either hand it to each of them or put one plate on the chair of each worker in your island. If there is still some left over, that could go elsewhere. 

In my company, goals aren't about what kind of work you would prefer to do. Instead, they are more about the kind of work you are being explicitly incented (financially) to do. In my company, you would work with your supervisor/manager when creating or modifying any goals, so no cheating could occur. 

You might choose to investigate if you qualify for an accommodation under the ADA. Most likely, you'll need to continue to be treated professionally, in order to get a physician to certify your continued incapacity to work. There are treatments for depression other than just medication. If you haven't, you should talk with your HR department to see where you stand, and what they plan to do once your FMLA leave is exhausted. You indicate that "due to all this and more" you are concerned that you will lost your job. It's not clear what and more means in this context, but perhaps that's the more significant issue that you want to discuss with HR. If the company thinks you have been abusing the FMLA (I'm not saying you have), then many will choose to dismiss you if you don't return to work. So it's best to find out now from HR what they plan, and what they have done with others in the past. That will give you an idea of what you must do going forward. 

The simplest thing to do would be to purchase a credit key and take your turn as the other team members do. You already do this in other contexts - just do it here too. If you still don't want to do that, then bring enough coins one time and announce that it's your turn that day. Use the coins. No need to make a big deal of this. Just be social and go along with the others. 

I don't know of any companies in my field and locale that would think this was an acceptable course of action. It's almost virtually certain that none of them would hire you back when you finished your academic education. And it's unlikely you would get a good referral if they found out your intent. It's your professional reputation, and you could play any games you like. But if you go this route, you might wish to keep your true intentions to yourself. 

I'll assume we are talking about folks who have graduated. If that's not the case, the student should just continue studying. Newly-graduated International folks often choose to go the contracting route. Many I have known work for agencies who will sponsor them, and in turn take contract positions - often moving to different parts of the country in order to stay employed. Eventually, they gain enough experience and find a company willing to sponsor them. 

You could call, speak to someone in HR or your former boss, and ask. Most likely they will have a record of your start and end dates, as well as what you were paid. 

It's a precautionary measure. It helps avoid potential disputes about patents filed while you are employed with the company. You should disclose any patents or pending patents so that the company won't feel that you developed the technology while with the company (in which case they may become the patent holder). 

I also have a lot of rapidly-changing tasks assigned to me. I tend to use MS-Word, MS-Excel, and lots of MS-Outlook in helping me manage my to-do list. I tend to schedule lots of "Appointments" with myself to carve out time for tasks (which gives me pop-up reminders 15 minutes before the task is due to start). And I send my self email "Reminders" of the details of all to-do tasks. Each morning, I read emails from the night before, and move them to folders as needed - leaving only the "to be done" items in my Inbox. I prioritize the day's tasks, organize my notes, and tackle my "Appointments" as the day goes on. By the end of the day, I have hopefully cleaned out my inbox, and thus completed the day's tasks. If not, I make more "Appointments" for the next day. This works for me. You might give it a try. There are also many "Getting Things Done / Time Management" classes out there, although selecting among them is a highly personal choice. 

No. Not in most fields, in most locales. Letters of reference have almost no value with the hiring managers I know, including me. It's just a piece of paper. Far better is to secure someone as a reference who can be called when needed, and who will say good things about you. If you have people your work with or work for who like you and would be good references, casually ask them if they would be okay being a reference. Get their contact information for future use. Then, when you have gotten to the point in a job search where you need a reference, contact them again. Give them the specifics of the situation - the job, the company, the name of the person who would be checking the references, etc. And thank them for their help. 

If it's relevant to the kinds of jobs you are seeking, isn't too far out of date (such that it looks like you don't keep up with your field), isn't littered with a lot of personal posts that have nothing to do with your profession, and isn't lame, then you could include it. You have a judgement call to make on whether you should include it or not. Some folks choose to leave references to their website/blog off of their resume, but include it in a cover letter when they think it will be helpful. That's the route I have chosen in the past. 

My answer would be different if you and your boss hadn't already discussed your desire to leave soon. But we can only deal with what is, not what might have been. If you feel a five-year commitment is unreasonable, you should discuss this with your boss before deciding if you'll accept the position. Since you've already specifically stated that you are considering moving to another city, your boss almost certainly is offering this new position with the understanding that you'll agree to delay your move for at least five years. Taking the job and then not following through on this commitment wouldn't be a good thing to do, in my opinion. If you discuss it openly first, your boss might agree that a 5-year commitment is too long, and might be willing to agree to something else. Or he might not - in which case you'll both know where you stand. In the end, it comes down to your word and your reputation. If you give your word that you'll stick around for 5 years, but don't actually plan to do so, then you are saying that people cannot trust you. And this might harm your reputation. You get to decide if you care about that or not. 

The project manager doesn't understand software well enough, and certainly doesn't understand testing well enough. Perhaps he needs to be educated. If you had a professional QA Department, I'd tell you to enlist the support of the QA Manager in explaining to this Project Manager the nature of software, the nature of bugs, and the nature of testing. I'd have the QA Manager indicate why it is simply not possible to test every condition, and how releasing/not releasing is a business activity aided by the findings from testing, but never by perfect information. You may wish to get a copy of Gerald Weinberg's excellent book "Perfect Software and other illusions about testing". In chapter 3 ("Why Not Just Test Everything?"), Weinberg has a section called "There are an infinite number of possible tests." He talks about a backdoor placed into a highly secure program whereby the ordinary password protection could be bypassed by typing W followed by three spaces, then M followed by three spaces, then J followed by exactly 168 more keystrokes without once using the letter L. Then he writes: "Do you get the point by now? If you didn't guess that the number of tests required to exhaustively test software is infinite, or at least "a number greater than I could run in my lifetime", you didn't understand the point of this chapter. Now you do." Explain to your Project Manager that every day of additional testing will improve your confidence in your code somewhat, yet it can never reach 100%. Tell him that you would be happy to continue testing at the expense of your other productive work. Then ask him how many more days he would like you to spend on testing and which of your other work should be deferred. If your Project Manager still doesn't get it, and you are feeling a bit flippant, ask him if he is 100% confident that every estimate he publishes is exactly correct and deadlines will never be missed. Ask him if he is 100% confident that no email he writes from now through forever will ever have a typo. Ask him if he is 100% confident that he will never make a mistake - now and in the future. 

No. If the hiring company believes you are not capable of handling the technical aspects of your job (which seems to be your assumption), then offering to accept less isn't going to change that. Companies don't want to hire the cheapest programmer, they want to hire the best programmer that fits within the role and budget. Take this as a learning experience. Practice interviewing until you aren't so nervous. Go to your next interview more confident and ace the interview.
