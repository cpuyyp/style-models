This is close to driving me nuts. I am still keeping temper right now, but I don't think I can hold it much longer if it happens again. The point is not who is at fault (please don't give an answer analyzing these two incidents about who did wrong or right). I am fairly open-minded to accept mistakes, and I do apologize to the whole team when I screwed up and caused everybody extra workload (happened once). It is the attitude. I don't want to lose temper in the whole office and shout him of his attitude, that would make me look really bad. Pulling him off to the side is slightly better, but if I accuse him our relationship is going to go sour. I am struggling to come up with alternatives. If it makes any difference, this is his first job after graduation. 

It depends, but Yes, some of us do consider entry-level candidates. It depends on what the company is looking for. If we need someone experienced to quickly bring things up to speed, sorry we will not consider you. But if we are simply not having enough manpower to work on certain tasks, then yes, you will be considered. One philosophy of recruiting is, there is no set role / responsibility for the hired person. Sure we all have an expectation in mind, but it doesn't mean we will not consider alternatives. Instead of thinking "the new employee will do this and that", we look out for candidates that might help the company, then we evaluate in what areas he/she can help us in the current situation, based on the candidate. So in a way, we "design" a job post specifically for each candidate. If we can design one, great, we will hire. If we can't, sorry, there is no work here we can find that you would be helpful. We are looking for someone else. 

Do not force people by saying "this is a company policy". If people fundamentally agree with you, cooperation will be much easier. 

The gist of it is: I'd spend (some) effort trying to understand why from that person's perspective. It is a bit time consuming; but if you can do that, it'd become a great management skill. 

I am having a difficult situation dealing with one particular employee right now. A very short background story is, he is a developer and I am the lead. On top of giving technical advises, I decide what tasks are allocated to the whole team and how much time they've got, I made the decision to hire them, & I advise the boss about their salary, who gets promoted etc. One particular developer, let's call him John, seems to be not respecting my role. For example, the team repeatedly finish tasks without checking for mistakes. When I questioned who did it in kind of an angry tone, John jumped the conversion and responded "Yes, it was a mistake. But you should point that out in an email to us". (Response in my head: when is it that you get to decide how I communicate to you?) On another occasion, I pulled one of our rarely used our servers offline. The team found that out during a demonstration session to a client. John messaged me: "Next time, you should ask us before pulling it offline." (Response in my head: oh, so YOU are telling me what to do now?) 

I would use the same judgment as I would if this were an important conference / meeting. Are you so sick that it would significantly affect your working ability to the point where you would just be wasting time? If this were a regular work day, would you get medical leave or would you travel to work anyway? With that said, I think there are several actions you can do to make the situation better: 

I see two things here: 1. This is an extra task This task is not included in your job description, outside your normal working hours and unpaid. You have a good reason to decline it as it is not what you're hired to do. Whether that is a good idea in the long term depends on your position within the company, company culture and your industry (e.g. some roles tend to have a lot of networking events and meet new people often). 2. Your personal events are affecting your work While it is irrational to expect everyone to act like machines (we're humans anyway), a reasonable amount of professionalism is expected. Depending on personality, this may not be easy. Events such as the death of a dear friend or a divorce can and do severely affect one's productivity. If you need time to quiet down, you can ask for a day or two holiday. You do not have to state the reason to anyone at the workplace. Just simply say you wish a day off. Combining the two Next time, you can simply reply "I'm not available on that evening". If somebody asks why, simply said "I have other activities after work" or "I have going out with a friend" or something similar. If your relationship with the others at the workplace is purely professional and not personal, there is no need to mention personal events to anyone. 

So that's the analysis. The question is, how can I help? From both a business standpoint (we don't want to lose an employee, he certainly is helpful), and from a "human / colleague" standpoint (I hate treating people like they're machines, I care about them and I wish everyone is comfortable). 

They are too busy. They want to hire you, but the workload of their normal duties have grown to a point where it is really hard to spare time on your case. They are waiting for an opportunity. In my previous company, we decided we would need to hire a new developer should we be awarded a project. We expected win the project within a week, so we began interviewing candidates. I feel bad for the candidates when we were told the project would be postponed two weeks, since we cannot give them an offer until we sign the contract for the new project, we had to make the candidates wait. There are internal obstacles. For example, the department wishes to hire you, but they need to apply funding from their superiors. The request had not been smooth, but they still wish to keep you around in case they have good news. 

I am a freelancer providing service to a small company. Let's call the boss John. Alice and Bob are two of his employees. I am not a part of John's company nor management team, I am simply an external party providing service. 

As a member of management, I have been informed that we are not doing too well financially for the past 5 months or so. The monthly income is just enough to settle everyone's salary. We have been trying to cut cost by dismissing interns and holding up purchases such as new equipment. Recently, we missed an electricity bill and power was cut to the entire office. If a junior member enquiries whether our company is running out of money, how should I respond? Background info: "Management" includes boss, me and another person. We are a small startup company. Together we decide company strategies, hiring decisions etc. 

Either way, I would have looked elsewhere by this time already if I were you. Life is short! If they take this long to give you an offer, how long do you think it would take them to give you a new computer, fix the printer, or a new desk? Another 6 months? There are some people who just like to delay things, make others wait for them and waste everyone's time (God knows why), sounds like they are one of them. It also means you are not attractive to them. When I look for a job, I want somebody who is in desperate need of me. It gives me the leverage to negotiate better salary and better offers! You guys still thinking about whether to hire me? Sorry, I've gone somewhere else (-; Seriously, look somewhere else, and forget them even if they get back to you later! 

Inform the employer as soon as possible. Ideally you should have never signed the contract, but that is too late for now. However, acknowledging that you made a mistake is responsible behavior, and we all mistakes. Being an internship, it is unlikely that your job will have a significant impact to the company's business. Companies usually hire interns with a "low-cost labor with lower-than-average quality" attitude, so they don't expect much to begin with. If they expected a professional commitment, they would have offered a full-time package and possibly hired someone experienced. Can you be held legally responsible? Technically, yes; practically, very unlikely. To sue you, the company must proof that because of your actions, the company has suffered loses and demand you to compensate. However, legal processes takes time and a lot of money; someone sensible would evaluate the cost of letting you go vs the cost of hiring a lawyer to come after you. Unless you were hired for an important or senior position and finding a replacement is costly, they're likely to just let you go. 

Last week, one of our developers approached the boss and asked for "some rest beginning January". We (boss, me, other members on the team) observed that he is stressed and wants to take a break from work, but the decision is not final yet. We discussed and identified a couple of points: 

Companies will not expect contractors to use their own product just because they signed a contract. Contractors are there to deliver work to the company, not to promote it. What you have in mind is for celebrities who sign a contract to promote a brand or company. Even if your company signed a marketing campaign contract, employees can still use whatever product they want unless they are in the eyes of the public. 

Move up as a senior engineer, or architect, or another role where a person needs to make important technical decisions. Things like designing a correct system topology, evaluating whether an approach is feasible etc. requires a skilled and experienced person. Giving an opinion which can be trusted (v.s. the junior programming saying "I will give it a try" or "I heard this might work") can be a very valuable. You are in a good position to provide this feedback as you have solid experiences working hands-on programming tasks. These decisions can be very technically challenging, and certainly different than managing a team and setting everyone's schedule. 

He seems to be having a low self confidence. In many of his emails, his tone sounds like he is addressing me (I am the technical lead) like he is addressing a college professor or a CEO of some very big company. This is his first job after graduation. It has been around one year or so. He focuses on his mistakes, for example spelling errors when naming a class or writing documents (which I simply pointed out in a brief comment during reviews). It appears that these mistakes are haunting him. He is very hardworking and absolutely puts in his best to deliver. For example, he'd respond to emails some time 22:00 (which is not expected, he can simply reply the next day, like everybody else does). When I found out I need a display cable adapter but it is not working, he'd immediately rush to the nearest store and got a new one for me in 15 minutes. The project, as a whole, has not been a success. It was a complete disaster back 9 months ago before I stepped in, but it's getting a lot better and we're nearly ready to launch. During all this time he is assigned to this project. Since we are a small startup company, someone has to do the office maintenance work like changing water bottles for the drink machine, feeding new paper to the printer etc. He volunteered to do many of this type of work. The rest of the team is OK - we are energetic and motivated. 

Yes, please do give feedback. Make the world a better place. That said, don't over-do it. I typically give a feedback less than 10 seconds long. We are not in an argument; don't waste time educating the candidate. If they're smart, they'll get it. They may disagree in their heart, no big deal. It is kind of like a friendly reminder. 

The person does not understand the technical reasons. Some technical reasons may be counterintuitive to those who have little experience. (e.g. If the plane is stalling (falling), the pilot should push the nose down, pointing to the ground, not up. Pilot trainings go to great length to make sure pilots understand the aerodynamics behind). The suggestion is causing extra workload to the person. E.g. a secure database design should store passwords in hashed values. If the developer is unfamiliar with hash functions, he may deny to change his clear-text code approach. Or, perhaps the developer has already finished all login logic. So what he is requested to do, (from his point of view), is essentially throw away all his previous work and start again! Needless to say, that would meet some opposition. A suggestion which looks trivial is actually very complicated in another domain. E.g. A boss once requested his developer team to do this: implement a textbox on day one, implement a textbox with colored text on day two, then implement a textbox with bold, italic, hyperlinks, images etc. on day three. It is a personality problem. In that case there is nothing you can do. Ideally, interviews should have screened candidates like this, but that's not always the case.
