Imagine you have a solar collector measuring one square meter, which can directly measure the power (energy per unit time) striking it. If there are layers of atmosphere above the collector, some of the incoming light is absorbed or reflected by particles in the atmosphere, so you won't measure as much power as if you place the collector in space at the distance of Earth's orbit, with no atmosphere between you and the Sun. But if you place the collector in the upper atmosphere of the Earth, the density of atmospheric particles above you is so small that they absorb/reflect only a negligible amount of power. Orientation is also an issue--you'll get the maximum power if you orient the plane of the collector so that it's perpendicular to the direction of the incoming rays. If it's not perpendicular, then if you approximate the incoming radiation as a set of parallel rays which each carry an equal amount of power (a standard approximation in optics) then fewer rays strike the collector when it's at some angle that's not perpendicular to the rays. All this is illustrated in the following diagram (from this page), with the two possible orientations of the solar collector illustrated in gray, and the light rays illustrated as black lines:

As the planets evolve during their protoplanetary stage and accrete materials from the protoplanetary disks, which are gravitationally collapsing interstellar dust and gases, these accreted particles retain some of the angular momentum from the materials they form from and being in constant motion.            Generated image (virtual fly-by) from a simulation of the accretion period of the protoplanetary disk, showing preservation of      angular momentum in the orbit around a Jupiter-size planet, as it clears its neighborhood. (Source: Frédéric Masset) One nice description for this angular momentum preservation, and why the planets appear to rotate faster than their surrounding protoplanetary disk goes like this: 

Actually, you sometimes can see the Moon illuminated by the Sun from the top, and therein lies the answer to your question - during day. When looking at the Moon during night time, the side of the Earth where you're standing and looking at it is pointed away from the Sun, while this is reversed during the day. The illuminated side of the Moon is also facing the Sun, of course. So we have: 

We can often read in the scientific and also more casual reader literature and articles about the angular resolution of various telescopes and other optical equipment, be it ground based or onboard space probes. They would often list their angular resolution, or in other words, their ability to resolve or distinguish small, distant objects with today's digital era mostly on a per sensor pixel basis.                              Finding a star's distance from its parallax. Trigonometric Parallax method determines distance to star by measuring                its slight shift in apparent position as seen from opposite ends of Earth's orbit. (Source: Measuring the Universe) What I'm interested in is, is the precision in measurements of parallax and with it our ability to determine distance of observed objects directly analogous to mentioned radial resolution and how could it be calculated using data on angular resolution of a telescope alone, if we assume both ground based and in space observatories have more or less the same perihelion to aphelion distance (i.e. the space observatory is in Earth's orbit). 

It's true that since the Earth is not a point, an observer in the upper atmosphere directly above that point on the surface would not be at exactly the same radius from the Sun as the radius of Earth's orbit (defined in terms of the position of the center of the Earth), but if you actually do the calculation of the solar constant at the radius of Earth's center vs. the radius of the point on the surface that's closest to the Sun, the difference is very small so it can be ignored if you're only stating the solar constant to nearest Watt/meter^2 or even the nearest tenth of a Watt/meter^2. The nominal solar luminosity is defined to be $3.828 \times 10^{26}$ and 1 AU is defined as 149597870700 meters, and if you use the formula you mentioned to calculate the solar flux at 1 AU it works out to 1361.1664654 watts per square meter. The radius of the Earth at the equator is about 6378 meters, so at an equinox when the Sun is directly overhead at the equator, an observer seeing the Sun directly overhead should be at a distance of 149597870700 - 6378 = 149597864322 meters, if you use the same formula to calculate the solar flux at this radius you get 1361.1665815, so it only makes a different if you want precision beyond the second decimal place. 

Based on our understanding of what might be possible causes for GRB, there's nothing to suggest that this phenomena is isolated to other galaxies alone, but we have so far only detected GRB originating from outside of the Milky Way. Good that we did too, because if any of them happened in our cosmic neighborhood and was pointing towards us, it would be the last thing we'd ever see and would effectively sterilize our planet. More information is available on Wikipedia on Gamma-ray burst, it's actually a pretty good article presenting extensive information on GRB (I guess that's why it's featured there). 

This is the animation of the Moon's position over Los Angeles, CA skies at 8 p.m. local (PDT) time from September 25 to September 27, 2015 (made with Sky Map Online):    As you can see, there isn't any way to describe its apparent movement with a single angular distance, whichever method you use. In astronomy, position of objects on the night skies is most commonly given by RA/Dec (Right Ascension and Declination), which places an object on the celestial sphere. Unless we count the Supermoon Eclipse on September 27, 2015 (your time, September 28 UTC), one that won't occur again until October 8, 2033, or exactly one saros period since the last one, there wasn't anything else as extraordinarily dramatic about the Moon's movement on those nights as you describe. So what happened is most likely that measurements by your observations weren't taken precisely enough; Be it you didn't time your observations precisely, didn't measure Moon's position relative to some fixed direction from some fixed vantage point, didn't project its position onto your scale taking the curvature of the celestial sphere into account, or a bit of any or all of these. The Moon, if observed at the same solar time from the same location, moves in apparent eastward direction (when it's visible and above the horizon, westwards when it's below the horizon, regardless if that's during day or night) roughly 13° per day, or, saying it otherwise, each day, at the same time, it will appear to lag for about an hour relative to its position a day before. Why? Simply because it completes one orbit around the Earth every 27.321582 days, so at exact same solar time the next day, it will be 360°/27.321582 or 13.18° more East. Its apparent movement during the same day is of course still East to West, because the Earth rotates on its axis towards East much faster than the Moon rotates around the Earth.
