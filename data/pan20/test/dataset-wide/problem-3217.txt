In most cases, the respective pilot participations reflected the postures of the respective militaries. For instance, the Netherlands surrendered only five days into the invasion, under the orders of its commander in chief, Henri Winkelman, who won "paroles" for his men. The Belgians fought 18 days and surrendered only at the behest of King Leopold, who had taken personal control of the military. This decision was against the advice of his government, and he also elected to stay in Belgium, unlike Allied leaders who fled their countries. The French surrendered under Marshal Petain, technically a civilian leader, but actually a war hero from World War I. With the notable exception of Charles deGaulle, the rest of the French military was also "defeatist." AS HorusKol noted, deGaulle's Free French used pilots originally based in North Africa, not France. On the other hand, the Czechs surrendered only under the direction of the civilian authorities (President Benes) with heavy prodding at Munich from Britain's Neville Chamberlain; the Czech military was more than willing to fight. Poland never really surrendered as a nation, although most individual units did. Part of the army survived by going into exile or maintaining the largest underground, resistance force in Europe. (Much of the latter morphed into the Home Army.) All this meant that many who were willing and able to fight were enabled to do so. The lack of Danish and Norwegian pilots can be explained by their scarcity, as you said. Otherwise, they were opposite cases. Denmark surrendered after a day, Norway held out as long as it could, and its merchant marine actually went over to England. 

In "Mein Kampf," Hitler opined, "We stop the endless German movement to the south and west, and turn our gaze toward the land in the east...If we speak of the soil of Europe today, we can have primarily in mind the soil of Russia and her vassal border states." He was concerned primarily with conquering Russia and eastern Europe. Fought France and Britain (enemies from World War I) as needed, but basically had no quarrel with, or interest in Spain and Portugal. It was better for Germany to have a (moderately) "friendly" country there than an outright enemy, especially given how well Franco's troops had fought in the Spanish civil war. The Allies similarly had no "issue" with Spain or Portugal. They wanted to defeat Germany, and retrieve France and other occupied countries. But since Germany had little interest in Spain and Portugal, neither did they. 

I'm referring to the fact that BOTH sides ordered their troops to fight for the city "to the last man and last round." (Hitler). The Soviet Union's General Vasili Chuikov echoed this by saying "We will defend the city or die in the attempt." The Soviets were the first to be besieged in Stalingrad in September, 1942. They "survived" by pouring in a steady stream of replacements and reinforcements. But more than 90 percent of the original complement of troops became casualties. The German 6th Army originally consisted of about 330,000 men. After they were surrounded by seven Soviet armies outside Stalingrad in November, 1942, only 91,000 Germans survived to surrender. Of these, all but 5,000 or so of the starving soldiers soon died in captivity. Making this adjustment, the German death rate was about 98%. Have there been other instances in history where both sides had armies that were besieged in turn at the same location? And both sides' besieged forces suffered 90+ per cent casualties? 

The Byzantine Empire did occupy Rome during the reign of Justinian I, which ended in 565, during which the Empire reached the peak of its power. By the time of Emperor Maurice (beginning 582), the Byzantine Empire had serious enemies closer to home, from Persia and the Balkans. Hence they were too weak (in Italy) to overcome a relatively small Lombard "wedge" that shielded Rome from them. 

The Credit Anstalt was actually the largest "offshore" bank of Germany, which at the time, was the world's second largest economy, meaning that it was a case of "when Germany sneezes, Europe catches cold." Here's what DIDN'T happen, this time around. 

The Whigs were left of center, and their sympathies were basically pro-American. Their great leader, William Pitt the Elder opined, "If I were an American, as I am an Englishman, while a foreign troop was landed in my country, I never would lay down my arms, never! never! never!" The Whigs would have been hostile to a "true blue" royalist, and the fact that Arnold's actions were treacherous only made matters worse in their eyes. The Tories were right of center, and their sympathies were pro-Crown. Hence, they welcomed the actions of Benedict Arnold as "beneficial" to their cause, whatever distaste some may have had for him personally. 

There was a "civil war" between two Chinese factions one under Wu Sangui, the other under Li Zicheng that handed the balance of power to the "Manchurians." This occurred after the "Nuzhen" or "Jurchen" (Manchurian) tribes had been united under one banner, with their capital and Shenyang. $URL$ A similar division of "China" between the Jin and Song dynasties accomanied by a similar unification of the Mongol tribes under Genghis Khan led to the Mongol conquest of China. Put another way, the "stars aligned" for both the Mongols and the Manchus at different times. 

During the American Revolution, at the Battle of Paoli, the English general, Charles "No Flint" Grey deliberately had the flints removed from his soldiers's muskets, so that they could use only their bayonets. He did not want his troops to warn the Americans by firing, because the American soldiers were better at shooting, even thought their weapons were not. The result was a surprise attack at night that inflicted heavy casualties on the troops of General "Mad Anthony" Wayne, at the cost of 4 British killed and 7 wounded. The Americans, under the same General "Mad Anthony" Wayne later used similar tactics during the storming of the Stony Point fortress. 

This posture appears to have been particular to Napoleon III. Previous French rulers preferred to capture pieces of Italy, specifically Piedmont and Lombardy, even if it meant dividing the country with the Hapsburgs (e.g. giving Austria Venice, or the "two Sicilies" to Spain. These rulers included Napoleon Bonaparte, and before him, several of the Kings Louis, and King Charles VIII. Napoleon III preferred to "rule by proxy." He felt, quite reasonably as it turned out, that France's interests would be best served by having a united, but weak Italy as a "buffer zone" against the expansion of Austria-Hungary. To him, what could be gotten for France was less important than what could be kept away from others. Ironically, Napoleon III also supported the candidacy of Maximilian (the brother of Austria Hungary's Franz Joseph) to be Emperor of Mexico as a check against the power of the United States. But his forces were defeated by the Mexicans at Puebla, May 5, 1862, and he "pulled" his support for Maximilian after the end of the Civil War, and the re-enforcement of the Monroe Doctrine, causing him to be executed by firing squad. 

It was the British (and later European) Agricultural Revolution of the 1700s, not the Industrial Revolution, that brought about this result. The development of new seeding, hoeing, and weeding technologies made it far more possible to grow crops in "marginal" lands such as forests and swamps. The result was that after stagnating for four centuries from 1300-1700 (the Black Death, Hundred Year's War, various wars between the Hapsburgs and France, including the 30 Years' War), Europe's population resumed its growth in the 18th century. The resulting use of "non-traditional" land for agriculture threatened the survival of the forests. A way to combat this threat was to require the planting of new trees for each one cut down; both "restoration" and a disincentive to cutting down trees. 

Most "bastards" were sired by their fathers with women of a lower rank than the fathers. Kings and princes would seldom have access to "princesses" (who were protected and treated like vestal virgins until they married) outside of wedlock, but they would have numerous relations with other women, ranging from servants to lesser nobility, who were "too low" to marry. Because of the "ineligibility" of the mothers, the children were not eligible to receive the full inheritance of their fathers. (Bastard children were sometimes allowed a "truncated" inheritance.) James Stewart, Earl of Moray (a truncated inheritance), was the older brother of Mary, Queen of Scots from such a situation. There was even an institution called morganatic marriage, under which a king would "marry" a non-noble woman, but their children would not inherit his title because the mother was not an "eligible" woman. When Archduke (Prince) Francis Ferdinand of Austria Hungary married a Bohemian Countess, the marriage itself was (barely) recognized, but their children were barred from ascending to the throne; he was supposed to marry someone "higher." What I wrote started with kings and princes, but of course, the principle applied to the rest of society. 

There were three major players in Italy: 1) France 2) Spain/Holy Roman Empire (HRE) (treat them as one unit since one man, Charles V, ruled both, and 3) Venice, the "local bully." The first stage of the war started when the other Italian states asked two large, outside powers, France and Spain/HRE to help them against Venice. That's why it was the League of Cambrai. In the second stage of the war, France was seen as the bully, and first the Papal states, then Spain/HRE allied with Venice against France. Henry VIII"s England also joined the anti-French alliance. In the final stage, Venice decided that Spain/HRE was the greater bully, and defected to the side of France, its former enemy. This was the way things stood when the war ended in 1516. Venice was vindicated over a decade later, Rome was sacked by HRE troops in 1527, which induced the Papal States, and even Henry VIII to side with France against Spain/HRE. But all this illustrated a rule that every boy learns on the playground: "You don't want to be the odd man out in a three way fight." At times, each of the three main parties was the "odd man out," and each strove hard not to be. The description from Machiavelli as "the least comprehensible war I’ve ever studied," refers to domestic and political issues in which he specialized. But it may best be understood in the context of a schoolyard brawl. 

Wikipedia states that paper use in Europe originated in Islamic-controlled Spain in the 11th century, migrated to Christian Spain shortly afterward, France in the 12th century, and Italy in the 13th. From there, it made its way to Germany in the 14th century, Mainz in 1320, and Nurnberg in 1390. The source cited for the "Mainz" claim is a 2002 paper written by Neathery Fuller. She is the wife of Archaeology lecturer Michael Fuller, and the two of them together won a Distinguished Service Award in 2009 given by the Archaeological Institute of America. Mrs. Fuller is a middle school teacher who leads summer archaeology field trips to Europe and Africa. 

Pregnancy was a far bigger deal in the 19th century, when a woman's primary function was to produce children. Going back to Biblical times, the greatest fear for a woman was to be "barren." This was, of course, before the modern "DINK" phenomenon (dual income, no kids). A woman who was pregnant was then a "proven performer." In her book, "Undercover Sex Signals," dating coach Leil Lowndes opines that we are in evolutionary terms only one step away from cave men. The logical followup conclusion is that good "caveman" traits, brute strength for men, fecundity for women, are highly attractive traits, even in relatively modern times, especially "early" modern times. 

Covered wagons were used in pre-railroad times (up to about 1850) to travel rough, undeveloped roads in the United States, particularly in hilly areas. Old Federal Roadin North Georgia was such a road, at the southern end of the Appalachians, and would have been travelled in the 1830s. 

Truman balanced Roosevelt's ticket in several important ways. First, he was a Senator (Roosevelt had been Governor of New York). He came from a poor background; Roosevelt was a rich man trying to convince poor people that he was acting in their interests, against fellow members of his "class." Truman was someone who had "worked with his hands," at a time when most voters did so, and had not been to college. Even so, Truman was "right" of (less radical than) FDR in his own party, not to mention Henry Wallace. The geographical factor was not unimportant. Missouri, besides being a decent-sized state, was close to the geographical and cultural center of the country. It was a good answer to Will it play in Peoria? Basically, it was on the edge of both the Midwest and the South; having been the "border state" nearest to Kansas before the Civil War. Roosevelt was rightfully confident about his ability to hold the key northeastern states of New York, Pennsylvania and New Jersey, but needed help in the Midwest; Ohio, Michigan, Illinois, Wisconsin, and Missouri were close states (Dewey barely won the first one). 

There are people who want "adventure" or a "change of pace" in any event. Persecution makes people more receptive to such a proposition (by making "what they have" less valuable), but wasn't always necessary to get people to want to go to the new world. 

By the end of the yayoi period, Japan had completed the transition from the earlier stone age society, to a metalworking society based on iron and copper, with weapons being typically tipped with iron. This gave way in the third century CE to the Kofun (early Yamato) period. At that time, there was no direct relationship between soldiers and the state, as was the later case with the samurai. Instead, something resembling Europe's later feudal system was in place, with a group of powerful (noble) clans reporting directly to the Emperor, and in turn raising armies of picked soldiers ostensibly (but not always) in the service of the Emperor. 

The Vietnam War was a more "limited" war than the Korean War. In Vietnam, the United States was not fighting to "unite" Vietnam as it was in Korea; the U.S. was "only" trying to keep South Vietnam independent of the North. As a result, U.S. ground troops were stationed in South Vietnam, but did not invade North Vietnam. There was no direct threat to the Chinese border as was the case in Korea. So China didn't feel the need to "officially" deploy troops in North Vietnam (although there were a number of "volunteers" providing mainly technical assistance. Both sides had learned something from the ferocity of the Korean war. So there was a tacit agreement to keep American (and therefore Chinese) troops out of North Vietnam, and limit the fighting to the South. 

High versus low tariffs for imported manufactured goods (the North wanted high, the South wanted low). Large versus small landholdings; slave versus free labor. The South wanted large cash crop estates worked by slaves; the north favored small "freeholders." Social diversity (or lack thereof). It may not be an accident that the term "ethnic purity" was coined by a southerner (Jimmy Carter) in the twentieth century. The South had two basic groups; white "Anglos" and black slaves. The North was much more diverse, at least with regard to European immigrants. A few large (populationwise) vs. many small states. This lead to the establishment of two houses of Congress: the House of Representatives for large states, and the Senate, which favored small (often Southern) states. 

The Soviet Union's invasion of Afghanistan in the late 20th century has its roots in the "Great Game" of the 19th century. At stake then was the British domination of India. Russia had long wanted a warm water port to the south. Her first choice was Constantinople (Istanbul), which met with British opposition e.g. in the Crimean war. Her second choice was Persia (Iran), and there was Soviet and British competition for influence in that country up to, and including the early part of World War II. Her third choice was "India," (including modern Pakistan, long part of British India). According to William L. Shirer in the "Rise and Fall of the Third Reich," one reason that the Soviet Union stayed in a pact with Hitler's Germany was because Hitler initially offered the Soviet Union a port in India (the offer was reneged when Germany invaded the Soviet Union). So yes, Britain had reason to fear that a Russian penetration of Afghanistan would work against her interests in India, (modern) Pakistan, or Iran. 

The Nazis weren't impressed by the Jewish Boycott. It led them to a retaliation Kristallnacht, that accomplished much the same thing, but with a greater impact. Put another way, the boycott may have caused the Nazis to do what they wanted to do anyway. Kristallnacht had an impact, not so much on the German economy, but on global public opinion. Anglo-Americans, who tended to distrust Germany all the way back to World War I now had a solid reason to do so. Here's a report from the German Ambassador
