Maybe but why would they? Killing off you citizens seems counterproductive. There are a few situations where this makes sense. Despite what you see in the movies 5 okay soldiers are often better than 1 really good one. So keeping the mediocre soldiers would normally increase the strength of your army. Killing off weak looking babies and boys that have trouble in training, makes you miss out on all the good they would have done either as mediocre solders or workers in some other field. There are three versions of this that would work, 

Never get married. 2 parents + 2 children = 1 vote 1 mother + 2 children + 1 guy who hangs out with them but is totally not the husband = 2 votes Even if they split the kids evenly there is an advantage. 1 mother + 1 child = 1 vote 1 father + 1 child = 1 vote There is a strong incentive to live together but never get married it doubles/trebles the voting power. There would be unofficial marragies with a great deal of negotiating about who gets the kids. The old are helpless Once your kids become adults you have no voting power and neither do they and so you can be deprived of any privileges since you lack votes to protect them. You only get indirect power when you become a grand parent. 

EMP from over the horizon and blind it, The EMP blast from a nuke can extend beyond the horizon ( the snake can't intercept it because the earth is in the way). The EMP might not penetrate the meters of armor, but who cares. It will fry the electronics near the surface, which are all the sensors. The snake will be blind and unable to intercept missiles or spot its opponents to shoot them. Then just nuke/bomb it into oblivion. As an added plus it will fry all the nanobots in the area to stop/ slow the repair process. If you want to be careful do it with three surface skimming nukes. One emp at 80 miles out to take down the nanobot probe birds that might spot the next one. The second at 30 miles to blind the snake and a third to kill it. It is possible to shield electronics from EMP but doing it well requires wrapping them in solid layers of conductors to create a faraday cage. The really hard part is protecting sensors (cameras, missile guidance systems, gps) which have to be on the outside. 

Goals- Don't kill people Transfer electricity cheaply and efficiently The power loss when transferring electricity = P = IV (current * voltage) and V = I*Rwire ( current * resistance of wire) or P = V^2 /R = I^2 *R So to minimize power loss when we have a high R (miles of wire) we drive V very high Then we want to maximize power available to the consumer for a smaller R The same equations apply, so if we can convert the high voltage low current flow to a low voltage high current flow we make much more power available. The conversion from High V low I to low V high I is very easy in AC current we just put a uneven inductor between them. The conversion in DC is much more inefficient. This is why we would like to use AC. What part of electricity kills people? Well It has to have enough voltage to get through humans skin ( a few volts). The easiest way for electricity kill a person by triggering nerves thus causing muscles to spasm (including the heart and lungs) giving people heart attacks. The key to doing this is to have electricity pulsed at the same frequency and nerve cells pulse (which is around 60 hz) Which is the frequency of household current in the US. So you would want 2 voltages 1 high voltages for transition lines and 1 low voltage for home lines, they should be AC and very far from 60hz in frequency) 

Hard Science Lower Bound What could you make today? As a lower bound what could you make with materials available today. Hydrolics are much stronger than muscles. So lets make a humanoid with a torso that is just a large hydraulic piston that telescopes up and down. The robot lifts with its torso From the wiki page we see industrial hydraulics can have 6000 psi systems, but 2,000 psi are more common. Wiki on hydraulics The area of the piston would be the cross-sectional area of a humans waist/stomach. Lets assume a fat human so the cylinder will be circular a 40 inch waist is radius of 20 and area of 1,256 inches ^2 This gives a max lift strength of 3,768,000 7,536,000 pounds. So given today's technology we could build a hydraulic piston shaped like a human that could lift 1,800 - 3,600 tons This assumes that we uses the rest of the volume for the pump, fuel, and hydraulic fluid reserves, but it seems reasonable. We could do scaled down versions for the other limbs. Fair warning a humanoid trying to lift that much weight would be apply around 2,000 psi to the ground underneath it which would break most floors and many roads. Edit: Credit to RonJohn for mentioning this idea before I thought of it. 

Why do you need weapons? The last time humans needed better weapons to fight anything other than other humans was back over 4000 years ago. If you cultures had rules or traditions that stopped physical fighting or limited it to ancient weapons no one would bother putting the effort to make weapons from rockets. There also might have been an invention that rendered projectile weapons useless. In Dune shields block all attacks moving faster then a small speed, blocking ranged attacks and forcing everyone to use swords. Then the old tech might have been abandoned 

Limit the value of money. This is the reason the US no longer prints anything bigger than 100 dollar bills. The US used to have 500 and 1000 but we got rid of them. So criminals having to make large hidden transactions have to now carry a suitcase of cash that is 5x larger or 10x larger making life harder for them, making them more noticeable and easer to catch. If we could drop from the 100 to the 20 then they would not be able to do sizeable payments except online. Problem is barter. Criminals now trade in valuable items instead of cash. They trade valuable art drugs or gems as a value dense secret trade medium. 

First it would be further east and north than the map in the question. In 1846 the US invaded and defeated Mexico and in the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo received the rights to all the territory that you claim for Deseret. The US had large loyal populations in Texas and California, and easily the strongest army on the continent. Since the US had just won a major war to get for the territory Deseret claims why would the US give it up? There was a lot of gold in the area. Something major would need to happen, and that would be the largest difference in culture. Were the Mormons much better warriors in this version, Serban Tanasa's answer. I could see an independent Deseret state further north and east where the territory claims were more disputed and populations were more sparse. But there would be a huge trade disadvantage since the US would probably hold the coast so the LDS would be land locked. 

Make a wide Ring world. See the book Ring World for a more full description. A very high strength outer shell is set spinning very quickly around a star, the centripetal force mimics gravity and keeps the shell taunt away from the sun, all pulls people along the inner surface toward the shell away from the sun. The shell must be mounted with thrusters to keep it centered. A cylinder is just an extended ring. Some caveats a supper nova is huge and would obliterate the surface of the ring if it were close enough to receive sun light. The ring world uses huge squares close to the sun to produce shadows and a day night cycle. 

Short answer Riot police their armor is made to be resistant to knives and flung bricks and base ball bats, it would work for most of this. Listed threats Melee weapons, have not gotten much more dangerous than they were in medieval times, Kevlar with a steel plate will stop them. Crossbows, modern crossbows have much less armor penetration ability than a rifle and far less range, any armor that would stop a rifle will stop them. The only difference is a crossbow bolt will have more momentum and so is more likely to knock you off you feet but it is much worse and breaking armor. A Taser is really easy to beat. The out layer of the armor has to be conductive, the standard one is a tshirt soaked in salt water, the front metal plate of a bullet proof vest also works. The current runs through the plate not you so you don't get shocked. The same applies to all shock weapons. Things you didn't mention Most armor fails against heat attacks, the standard in riots is the Molotov cocktail a bottle of flaming gasoline. Even if you armor is fireproof the guy inside can't breath through the smoke and gets burned. This is one of the reasons they carry those riot shields. 

Sure you just need electricity and water and something to convert O2 to CO2 You run lamps to replace the sun light and create a farm. You water it and breath to convert the O2 from the plants to CO2 which they can use. The farmer needs a supply of fertilizer ( it may be from him to keep the soil rich) or he needs to rotate crops in that replace lost nutrients like soy beans. 

Its not a paradox but is does violate causality. Gravity light mass they are all limited by the speed of light. Normally an effect can only occur when news of its cause reaches it. Since information travels at the speed of light you can only get information of things that are d / c meters away, where d is distance and c is the speed of light, this called the speed of light cone. If the Sun vanished into thin space earth would continue to feel the pull of its gravity and see light coming from it for 8 minutes when the news of the sun's disappearance would arrive with the disappearance of its gravity and sunlight. You ship could violate causality and learn things it should not yet know. 

Why bother? Instead of everyone carrying around complicated magic batteries, that might be volatile or heavy, why not carry around IOUs / access tokens that grant the barer ownership of magic stored at the bank? Pros of magic currency: You don't need to trust a third party to store the value ( energy) the backs the currency. Good if there is not a strong government. You can't counterfeit it for less than then its value(it either has the right amount of energy or not) so a "fake" with the right charge is as valuable as and official one. Any mage could make currency, Cons: The currency may be expensive to create as you want to make tons of batteries. If the cost to create the currency is near the value of it you lose value. The penny in the US costs more to make than 1 cent. You lock your money supply to the battery manufacturing rate. A improvement in manufacturing will cause sudden massive inflation, if a plant is damaged there will be sudden deflations. See what happened to Spain when they got a ton of gold and silver You lock up a bunch of energy in currency. The energy sitting in the currency could be used to do other things. It might be difficult to carry around a lot of wealth this way, to buy a 10,000 chip castle I have to haul a wagon with 10,000 chips. The batteries might be unsafe, what if you break one does magic energy explode out? Non mages would have a hard time verifying or using the currency.
