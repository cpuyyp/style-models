Just buy the city Alaska comes to mind here, once owned by Canada, it was then sold to Russia and then to America. Now this is a land mass rich in oil and was sold finally for a total of +4 billion. If I have 1 trillion dollars and only 4 million citizens, I can buy the city from the mayor and rise the rent to the point where the remaining 3999999 citizen just move rather than pay $100000 a month for water. 

There are a lot of great answers here, so I'll just add my 2 cents. Below are a bunch of photos of armless people doing various sports; 

The above depiction is based on what the post WW2 Rhineland would look like by an alternate historian, I could not find the actual propossals If the Rhine ever became independent I fail to see how it could not be at least heavily allied with France. The best you are going to get is the Rhine being a French Protectorate after your war, then decades later after World War 2, they vote to become independent and the vote passes. 

In an alternate history I am designing, France wins the Seven Years War and does not lose their land claims in America. A problem I have reached though is explaining why land east of the Mississippi winds up in American control. How can I explain why the land east of the Mississippi (represented by the red line) would come into American control? 

It won't This doesn't matter. Life on earth started 3.8 billion years ago and the Cambrian explosion was only 530 million years ago. that's a 2.3 billion year difference. so by the time the Martian equivalent of the Cambrian explosion will take place in 4.1 billion years. Whoopsie daisy! That may be a problem, because in only 4 billion years Andromeda will crash into the Milky Way. Though there is a hope, because we do not know if Earth life evolution is average or not, so we may have been slow. So to answer your question, we will ignore this, we will also ignore that the heating of Mars to the level you want will likely wipe out Earth life. We need to use a bit of handwavium as well, because a blast large enough to send debris from Earth to Mars(an average of 225 million km) would superheat said debris. Unfortunately, the question then becomes really broad at best. Saying we have a choice of what is on the debris means that you asking for which organisms will survive, and what traits will start to develop among the populations is dependent on the things on said debris. that combined with the fact that the 1.8 billion year gap if way too long in evolutionary terms to even guess what life on this future Earth will look like. Assuming; 

When you get started here, you can really get rolling. I can imagine a species that instead of sleeping half a brain at a time; lives on quarters, or even eighths at a time. Keep in mind that if they evolved in this world, they wouldn't even have a concept of night; never mind associate it with sleep. Of course, if you have your world suddenly have no night, then this answer is pointless. 

This wouldn't be a problem if not for the fact that there are good arguments for both sides. The Question(s) 

Because of the fact that people vote, mixed with truth 4, means that just because you guaranteed she makes it there, does not mean people will vote for her. She needs to win over the people. Because of truth 3, there is a maximum that money can buy and that leads to your answer; To guarantee presidency, you need to buy it and because of how presidency works, you need to buy votes in order to do that. That is illegal, so the answer is no, but then again, depending on your wealth, you could; 

If we reach the same end result via a different route, why should our beliefs differ? These steps bring us to the conclusion that, if other sentient species exist, we should expect ours to have an unusually high population. Take a look at the pie charts below to get an idea of just how different we may be. 

What does this have to do with war? Well, using this theory, we know we exist as a species with a larger population than most. By this logic, we are the ants and aliens are the beetles and the spiders, they can kill dozens of us, but as a whole we have strength in numbers, making us a powerful force for an alien military. 

From User2813274 comment, XKCD has talked about why an animal would not do this. To the question, If cows could photosynthesize, how much less food would they need? 

I see 2 solutions here. Devotion to specific gods rather than the pantheon as a whole, called henotheism: the belief in and worship of a single god while accepting the existence or possible existence of other deities. To a henotheist, entities worshiped by other people can be dealt with a few different ways: 

I want you to know before I say this, I am sorry for this answer. But the simple answer is no. Problems with unwanted solutions For life to evolve it needs to start on a planet the exists in the habitable zone. A star that has a habitable zone that is that far away would be massive but would only live for a few millions years(unless a god created your species this won't work for even the simplest creatures to evolve). Lets say that by using some handwavium that there is liquid water there. The creatures that live there would not be sapient, mollusks like clams and barnacles might live but a sapient creature doesn't stand a snowballs chance in hell. What if it worked? So lets add another cup of magic hand waving to this cake of a question and say that gods(or god like creatures) indeed created these creatures, they would only want to explore planets for mining and depleting resources(sounds evil to me). I imagine they would have suits of dry ice and other extremely cold things to prevent overheating, since dry ice expels Co2 they will need a hardy respiration system. I didn't have time to write a full answer but I hoped this helped. 

Oligosynthetic languages are languages with many suffixes and few roots, often leading to a vocabulary of only a few hundred words. While common in constructed languages, they are not found in nature. 

Sperm whales hunt giant squid; How the whales manage to subdue such able prey has been a mystery. One hypothesis, proposed more than 20 years ago, speculated the whales used powerful ultrasound shrieks to knock their squid prey senseless before scooping them up. Like bats and dolphins, some whales use ultrasonic clicks to find prey and navigate. The basic premise is that that, since sound travels faster underwater, that a beam of sound(echolocation) that is narrow enough could kill in the same way shockwaves do; by rupturing the organs of the animal. A few helpful links of weaponized echolocation; 

On a generation ship, the people living on it need oxygen, lots of oxygen. More than they can realistically carry, thus a generation ship must be able to create breathable air from relatively common materials and elements found it space. How does a generation ship provide oxygen to the people inside it? What common elements can the ship rely on to provide lets say 100 million people with breathable air for an indefinite amount of time? 

A common trope weapon in science fantasy (such as RWBY or the appropriately named Gun Sword) is the gunsword. As the name implies, a gunsword is a sword that's also a gun, or vice versa. This has always interested me as a concept, kind of an evolution of the bayonet in my mind, but could such a weapon exist, or rather why would a person use such a weapon? What reasons would a gunsword be preferred over a regular gun or a regular sword? Why would an army use them? Why would a person use one? Is the gunsword a realistic, feasible concept? 

*As the time of day does not matter, technically twilight and dawn both allow for what you want, in fact,above shows a perfect depiction of late night meeting early day. 

For the most part human against human bloodsport lived and died with the Romans, but a common sight in fantasy or science-fantasy is the existence of gladiator arenas in some form (Hunger Games to name a current popular one). Which makes me wonder, what historical events would best support (in a realistic way) modern day man vs man combat? 

I like the points made by the above answers and want to point out another; Mount Rushmore. Mount Rush erodes at a rate of 1 inch every 10 000 years, with each of the noses being about 240 inches long, so they would take some 2.4 million years to erode, barring an ice age that sent glaciers down to scrub them away. Of course, the faces would start to lose some definition after half a million years or so, but they'd still be recognizable as faces. If there was an ancient civilization as advanced as us or more, they would have monuments and these monuments will last. 

In a timeline I am working on, France wins the Seven Years War, mainly due to better support from their Allies Austria and Russia. One of the consequences of this is that the French Revolution does not happen (or if it does, much later). But after looking at it more, I have begun to wonder what the effects of the loss would be in homeland United Kingdom. If England had lost the Seven Years War, what would be the short term effects in England? Would an English Revolution happen per say? Or would they just be economically weakened? 

There are many solutions The Immediate solution I thought of is to build it underwater in the first place, primarily in the Marianas Trench, where there is plenty of water, but that would require a very effective water purifier. A quick google search later and I found this website. It agreed with my thoughts that a wise choice when planning your water storage is to have at least one water treatment option on hand. It may be necessary to venture out of the shelter for more water (or if underwater, open a water chamber). If you have to stay for an extended period of time in any shelter with even a large amount of stored clean water, your water may become contaminated and require treatment. If there is any question about the potability of your water, it’s safest to treat it first. Luckily you have several options available for emergency water treatment, including:
