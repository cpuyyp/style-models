Findings are suggestive of a neurotoxic effect of cannabis on the adolescent brain. As DrugAbuse points out, this loss seems to also be consistent with findings in animal studies. The length of the study, publication, number of participants and variables considered show good methodology. The difference between the two studies mentioned in the question is that the second had a large enough sample to account for socioeconomical differences, and found no direct correlation them and IQ loss associated with cannabis use. 

If someone has 300 gr of Turkey, that alone is almost 600 calories (without the filling or gravy), add a couple of pumpkin pies, you are already over the thousand. With rolls, alcohol and snack you might get to the 4500, or not. There is a lot of variation. In both cases, the single meal is over the daily recommended ingestion, which is around 2000-2500 calories a day. 

First of all, smoking statistics in Sweden has followed a trend very similar to that of the rest of the world. I do not think that there is reason to assume that climate is a factor here, and I wouldn't even say that there's much of a difference to be explained in the first place. Tobacco consumption *OECD Second, as Hendy points out in comments, the legalization of different substances has little relation to their relative health effects. That is rather a question of policy, and a general trend is often that you seek to criminalize harmful substances if possible, but make exceptions where it is shown or assumed that the implications of smuggling etc would be worse than the direct health effect. However, there are other ways to approach the problem as well, and this is not the forum for political discourse, so I shan't dwell on that beyond having pointed out that this is not a good indication of the health effect of a product. Now, as far as the actual health implications of snus are concerned: 

The study followed 1,037 individuals from birth (1972/1973) to age 38. Each person was interviewed at age 18, 21, 26, 32, and 38 and took IQ tests at 13 and 38. The results are in line with what the article you linked mentions: 

Adding to Articuno's answer, the reason no remains of the type have been found is because adult hominids taller than (about) 9 feet simply can't exist. It's about physics: If you double the height of any being, its surface area quadruples, and its volume triples. While lengths scale linearly (x), areas scale quadratically (x^2) and volumes scale cubically (x^3). This means that a human as big as those in your examples would not reach adulthood. The oldest remains of a person with gigantism are those of a man that lived close to Rome in third-century A.D. Gigantism itself is extremely rare (about three people in a million worldwide today). 'Giants' can't exist because it's a scaling issue. Galileo was one of the first to point it out: 

Heaps more info here We have a very similar system in Sweden. The IT magazine Ny Teknik wrote an article called "Yes, you can detect flat screen TV's as well", to debunk the somewhat popular claim to the contrary. Article (swedish), Terrible Google translate. The article makes the following points (my translation): 

I'd be inclined to believe the shoe retailers are behind the video. A year ago, this video of a new sport called Liquid Mountaineering went pretty viral as well. A key point in the video is that they found these shoes that are completely water repellant. Kobe seems to attribute quite a lot to the shoes as well. You don't see that with people who are winning the olympics :) Of course I can't prove that the shoe retailers are behind it, but that doesn't really make a difference. The Liquid Mountaineering video, though well made, was obviously fake, as you simply can't do that. It's not as obvious that you couldn't do what Kobe does in that video, but it would certainly be easier to fake it. He's probably just standing closer to the camera than the car is, so he's jumping in front of the car (from our perspective). The jump still has to be just as impressive, but it would be completely safe to perform it, and he could try it a hundred times until he got it right. 

If humans were to be doubled in size, for example, their shape would need to change so much they would hardly be considered the same species. 

This is not true. Most of Palenque has been thoroughly surveyed, mapped and documented. While not all areas have been excavated, there has been extensive analysis of the settlement. 

In general terms, inbreeding is dangerous because it increases the chances of homozygosity. This means that for a particular gene, identical alleles of the gene are present on both homologous chromosomes. Those individuals result of the inbreeding have more chances of having recessive or deleterious traits. These are generally 'invisible', they don't express physically, but they are present in the genes so if a person has two of them, they can become a manifest trait. Some examples of negative traits are reduced fertility, increased genetic disorders, lower birth rate, higher infant mortality or loss of immune system function. You can calculate the risk of recessive traits (an example of inbreeding calculation for dogs, and more info here). It is greater when the parents are close relatives and lower for relationships between more distant relatives: 

If you eat a lot, you'll feel rather uncomfortable doing any physical exercise immediately after. As for getting stomach cramps and dying, though, that has never happened. So says snopes: 

"Black magic" is a really large umbrella for a wide range of claims, but the very definition of any "magic" is that it is somehow supernatural. Naturally (!), no compelling evidence has ever been put forth for any supernatural phenomenon. Once a phenomenon is observable, reproducible, and testable, and shown to exist, it may turn out to violate our current understanding of the natural laws, but if the phenomenon is for real, we shall have to adjust our views to accommodate this, and the phenomenon shall cease to be considered supernatural. "Magic" will never be shown to exist. All rigorously tested supernatural claims have turned out to be fake, and the great number of untested supernatural claims can most likely be largely attributed to the fact that the practitioners are aware of their fraud, and reluctant to be exposed; see the million dollar challenge in Regebro's answer. More specifically, in regions of India there is a somewhat widespread belief in tantra. While few practitioners would lend themselves to scientific studies for reasons explained above, there has been one notable appearance where Indias allegedly most powerful tantrik was challenged in live TV in front of an audience of millions of people, to kill a person with the aid of black magic alone. 

You can see the PDF map here. There are also two main works that derived from this mapping. I highly recommend both, but the first one is particularly enlightening: 

If you double all the dimensions of a stone building supported on stone pillars, the weights are all increased eightfold, but the supporting capacities only go up fourfold. This all applies to animals and humans too: 

The main reason for larger breasts existence (which would explain their evolutionary presence) seems to be not lactation -pre-pregnancy size is no indication of a woman's ability to produce milk-, but because they are a signal of a woman's ability to store fat - and therefore be considered more fertile (Mascia-Lees et al., 1986, Pawlowski, 1999, Pawlowski et al., 2004). Women with hourglass figures have been proven to be more likely to become pregnant: 

The problem with TV detector vans is not that they don't work at all, but rather that they are just now ceasing to be effective, as we're moving towards exclusively digital signals. As TV detection yields diminishing returns, the cost/benefit balance will soon turn TV detection into an unreasonable endeavour. Techniques that are not as likely to go out of date include: 

Wasn't sure on this one myself, so I did some research. I've come across this explanation, which sounds similar to what was my understanding before, so it's true by confirmation bias: 

The conclusion might be that the topic is controversial, which you'll certainly find with a lot of studies on aspects of personality and psychology, and there could very well be cultural discrepancies. In The influence of humor, participants were asked to identify the most desirable partner for a romantic relationship, using the same subjects, and having a humorous or neutral autobiographical description as the only variable. The difference in study design could potentially explain some of the discrepancies in the conclusions of the two studies, in that the former measures what traits people perceive that they value, and the latter measures to what extent they're actually taken into account. This means that the latter study could cover subconscious parts of decision making. Another possible interpretation is that the two results are entirely compatible, and that this is exactly what you can expect when you're specifically testing a hypothesis, and compare that to result of a more qualitative study design. For instance, it is quite possible that the table from the first study matches exactly the weighting that was applied in the decision making in the second study. That could be explained by the other traits; e.g. Beauty - which is the only p<.01 difference, remember - might be so strong a determinant in the male respondents that the humorous/neutral tagline variable didn't affect the outcome, whereas the female respondents, quite in line with what the first study reports, doesn't pay as much attention to beauty, and therefore allow the humour variable to affect the outcome to a greater degree. I do recall Richard Wiseman citing support for the idea that women do value humour significantly higher than men, in his book 59 Seconds, but I don't have it available at the moment to be able to check those sources, or even what the exact claims are. 

Excavation Not all areas that were charted have been excavated. Excavations are invasive and destructive, not to mention really expensive when done in the jungle, as trees keep growing and burying structures each year. It's rare to find completely excavated cities, though, especially when newer structures have been built on top of old ones, and the land is in private hands. Maintenance can also be a big issue for these sort of sites. The biggest structures in Palenque have been explored to detail from 1922, however, and those can be considered representative of the city as a whole. You can see the full list of excavations and investigations in the Palenque Project website. Also, the map is impressive, so here's a smaller version:
