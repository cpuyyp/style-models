**Note: of course, if we add $\lambda g(x)$ rather than subtract it to the Lagrangian, the signs reverse. I've seen many different conventions, and I'm going with the one that makes $\lambda$ nonnegative. The Wikipedia article uses the opposite convention. 

Certainly the economy is not a "zero sum game" (whatever that means). There has historically been a positive aggregate net return on capital investment - there doesn't have to be a loser for every winner. That said, economists generally believe that as the stock of aggregate savings increases, the return will go down; this is a consequence of diminishing returns to capital. Hence it's not possible for everyone to save an unlimited amount at 4%. To be a little more concrete, economists often use a constant-returns-to-scale production function $F(K,L)$, taking capital $K$ and labor $L$ as inputs, as a first-pass way of thinking about the world. In this simple model, net aggregate savings equal capital $K$. Holding $L$ constant, the extent to which more $K$ will push down the net return to capital $r=F_K-\delta$ (where $F_K$ is the marginal product of capital and $\delta$ is the depreciation rate) depends on the elasticity of substitution of the function $F$. With a high elasticity of substitution, $K$ can increase substantially without $r$ falling very much, as the economy continues to find productive applications for capital despite its relative abundance; with a low elasticity of substitution, a rise in $K$ can result in a large drop in $r$. 

Mandelbrot's original application to cotton prices, The Variation of Certain Speculative Prices, claimed that the price fluctuations followed a Lévy stable distribution with a stability parameter $\alpha$ below 2. ($\alpha=2$ corresponds to the normal distribution.) To be honest, I'm not sure how this was an application of "fractals" where previous contributions were not. While the sample paths of the Lévy stable process we was investigating have fractal characteristics—for instance, a non-integer fractal dimension—so does good old Brownian motion, which has fractal dimension of 1.5. Indeed, the relationship between fractal dimension $D$ and the stability parameter $\alpha$ is $D=2-1/\alpha$, so that Lévy stable processes with $\alpha\in (1,2)$ actually have a $D$ closer to 1 than Brownian motion—in a sense, they're less fractal! The contribution of Mandelbrot here was, I think, to illustrate the rich variety of possible stochastic processes that asset prices can follow. (Processes that happen to exhibit a variety of fractal features.) He proposed, for instance, both Lévy stable processes as in the cotton price paper and, later, fractional Brownian motion. Since this isn't my field (and I'm relying on half-remembered undergraduate knowledge at the moment), I can't say too much about the cutting edge of research here. I do know that "tempered" Lévy stable distributions are still quite popular for modeling. (These distributions make tails enough thinner that all moments exist, whereas the usual Lévy stable distributions with parameter $\alpha$ have no moments $\alpha$ or higher. Not having a finite second moment is a big problem for financial applications, which is why this modification is necessary.) Variants of fractional Brownian motion remain common as well. This Wikipedia article, although not too well-written, discusses why such stochastic processes can be useful for financial modeling. It's safe to say that Mandelbrot has a very, very active legacy in finance. 

(One complication, by the way, is that I think banks are generally not charging negative interest on small-scale retail deposits. At least superficially, then, the relevant interest rate isn't negative for the typical consumer; but I suspect that banks are making up the difference by charging fees, etc., which is already necessary to recover their costs even when interest rates are at 0%. For large-scale deposits, on the other hand, banks are charging clients to hold cash - and, of course, this must be true, since money market rates wouldn't be negative if it was always possible to find some bank that would give you a zero rate.) 

The log-linearization is performed in the neighborhood of a steady state with zero inflation, constant output, and constant markups over marginal cost, as stated on slide 11 of the Galí presentation you link. Hence $Y$ is indeed intended to be a constant value, the steady state level of output around which the log-linearization is performed. $Y_t$ is just the level of total output in period $t$, while $y_t=\log Y_t$ is the log value of total output, as you say. Several additional points that seem to be relevant here: 

I don't mean to dismiss corporate cash management as a topic altogether - I'm sure that it can be an important topic for corporate finance guys. But given these relative magnitudes, I do think that aggregate cash accumulation is a pretty minor macroeconomic issue right now, and that its high profile in the media (with a lot of discussion about "idle" cash, etc.) is misplaced. (Random aside: corporate cash holdings are apparently quite concentrated, with a great deal held by tech companies; this article claims that Apple alone accounts for almost 10%. In my view this is another clue that aggregate cash probably isn't that important a macroeconomic datapoint.) 

Not really. While it's possible that the Morgan intervention softened the initial stock market decline, the vast majority of the ultimate collapse in securities prices, commodity prices, industrial production, and the banking sector took place after the purchases had been liquidated. First some history: the bankers' pool intended to lift the stock market was assembled at the J.P. Morgan & Co. offices on October 24, 1929, "Black Thursday", the initial day of market chaos. They pooled their resources and directed broker Richard Whitney to place high bids on blue chip stocks at the NYSE to lift the confidence of the markets. This stemmed the crash on Thursday and led to a rally that continued the next two days. Indeed, the following Sunday's New York Times lauded the "carefully arranged" plan to boost the market, and mentioned that the inclusion of the First National Bank in the buyers' pool the next day confirmed to Wall Street that "the danger of panic had been averted". Some history of these events is provided in the Wikipedia article on the crash. Alas, the Monday and Tuesday immediately following this confident appraisal - October 28 and 29, 1929 - are known as Black Monday and Tuesday, respectively. They experienced the second and fourth largest daily percentage DJIA declines in history, combining for easily the largest two-day percentage decline in history. Most newspapers at the time described the bankers' pool as waiting to intervene until late Tuesday, when they cut margin requirements and placed buying orders (see AP article). An AP article describing the crash on Monday opened with "powerful financial interests stepped aside today and let the stock market drop...". Finally, on Wednesday the bankers' pool entered with strong buying orders, leading to the third highest daily percentage DJIA increase in history. The next day the pool apparently stepped away from the markets once more. It kept going like this for a little while, with some more volatility in markets over the next few weeks but eventual stabilization and partial recovery. Finally, the banking group quietly wrapped up its activities in February 1930, with press accounts mentioning that it "come out about even". Given all this, it's possible that the bankers' pool offered some initial stabilization of the markets. (Although even that's not clear: from press accounts, it seems just as likely that volatility was increased by the erratic day-to-day decisions of the pool.) But again, any significant effect seems unlikely, because the vast majority of the carnage in the Great Depression took place after the pool had been liquidated in February 1930. To convey some sense of this, the following graph shows (in log points) the fall of the DJIA, industrial production index, and wholesale price index in the US starting in September 1929. As you can see, the initial declines in late 1929 and early 1930 - although substantial - are far smaller than the eventual ones. This is in line with the modern consensus view on the Great Depression, which emphasizes the role of the gold standard and its propagation of adverse monetary and banking shocks, rather than the initial market crash itself. 

This is surprisingly subtle. When, for instance, when bank A in the Richmond Federal Reserve district sends $1000 in reserves to bank B in the Minneapolis Federal Reserve district, reserves are taken out of bank A's account at the Richmond Fed and placed into bank B's account at the Minneapolis Fed. Now, bank A's reserves are a liability on the books of the Richmond Fed, while bank B's reserves are a liability on the books of the Minneapolis Fed. Without any offsetting change, therefore, the process would result in the Richmond Fed discharging a liability and the Minneapolis Fed gaining a liability - and if this continued, regional Fed assets and liabilities could become highly mismatched. The principle, then, is that there should be an offsetting swap of assets. It would be too complicated to swap actual assets every time there is a flow of reserves between banks in different districts. (There's over $3 trillion in transactions every day on Fedwire, the Fed's RTGS system - and if even a fraction of those are between different districts, the amounts are really enormous.) Instead, in the short run the regional Feds swap accounting entries in an "Interdistrict Settlement Account" (ISA). In the example above, the Minneapolis Fed's ISA position would increase by \$1000, while the Richmond Fed's ISA position would decrease by \$1000, to offset the transfer of liabilities. So far, this is all very similar to the controversial TARGET2 system in the Euro area, in which large balances between national banks have recently been accumulating. The American system is different, however, because ISA entries are eventually settled via transfers of assets. Every April, the average ISA balance for each regional Fed over the past year is calculated, and this portion of the balance is settled via a transfer of assets in the System Open Market Account (the main pile of Fed assets, run by the New York Fed). Hence, if in April the Minneapolis Fed has an ISA balance of +\$500, but over the past year it had an average balance of +\$2000, its balance is decreased (by \$2000) to -\$1500, and it has an offsetting gain of \$2000 in SOMA assets. As this example shows, since it is average balances over the past year that are settled, not the current balances, ISA balances do not necessarily go to zero every April. Historically, they were fairly tiny anyway, but since QE brought dramatic increases in reserves, these balances have sometimes been large and irregular. In the long run, though, the system prevents any persistent imbalances from accumulating. (Note: the process in April is a little bit more complicated than I describe, since some minor transfers of gold certificate holdings are also involved. Basically, gold certificates are transferred between regional Feds to maintain a constant ratio of gold certificates to federal reserve notes; the transfers of SOMA assets are adjusted to account for this. Wolman's recent piece for the Richmond Fed is one of the few sources that describes the system in detail.) 

**Explanation (though I'm rusty): $A$ has a unique Perron-Frobenius eigenvalue of 1, and since $A$ is stochastic the right eigenvector of this eigenvalue is the unit vector $e$. This is still the right eigenvector, now with an eigenvalue of 0, when we take the matrix logarithm. 

Indeed, there is always a way that money leaves the central bank without being paid back: the central bank does something with its net interest earnings, usually sending them to the central government, which treats them as part of its revenue, and is therefore able to get by on a little less tax revenue than it would otherwise need. For instance, in 2013 the Federal Reserve remitted $78 billion in profits to the US Treasury. Let's incorporate this observation into an augmented version of your example. Suppose that the central bank keeps the supply of money at \$10, with a corresponding loan of \$10 to banks, and the annual nominal interest rate is 10%. Suppose that the central government spends \$5 per year and runs a balanced budget. Each year, banks pay \$1 in interest to the central bank. This is profit and is sent to the central government, which then only needs to raise \$4 in taxes to pay for its \$5 in spending. The net effect of this is to put \$1 in the hands of the public, which ultimately finds its way to paying for the \$1 in interest that banks owed to the central bank. (After all, these banks are presumably lending out the money and collecting interest from the public themselves.) One can make the example much more intricate, but the key point is that we don't get an exponentially growing debt owed to the central bank by the rest of the economy - because the central bank sends its profits to the government, and then they're recycled into the rest of the economy. (As user4385 points out in a comment, the situation is similar for any kind of debt. Suppose, for instance, that Connecticut is a net creditor to the rest of the country - where does the rest of the country get the money to pay interest to Connecticut? The answer is that Connecticut eventually spends its interest earnings on goods and services from the rest of the country - funds flow in both directions.) 

This definition is made on the production side, but gross value added can also be broken down into income. On the income side, it includes worker salaries, as another account excerpted from Understanding National Accounts shows: 

As the discussion here suggests, there are many possible costs and benefits to inflation. One source that might be edifying here is the 1996 FOMC discussion that ultimately resulted in the US's 2% inflation target. This discussion focuses on one particular aspect of the inflation tradeoff: namely, the effects of long-term, low levels of inflation. It offers some useful insight into what policymakers view as the most quantitatively important consequences of long-term inflation in a country like the US. Janet Yellen, who was then a Fed governor and advocated for the 2% target, sums it up on page 43 of the FOMC transcript. She lists one cost from inflation and two benefits: 

One recent paper that is being positioned as a very wide-ranging theory of bounded rationality (although certainly it doesn't come close to capturing every insight in the field) is Gabaix's forthcoming QJE, A Sparsity-Based Model of Bounded Rationality. Gabaix formulates a fairly general model where agents can rationally decide to pay limited attention to each economic variable (depending on its importance), and derives the consequences for the classic features of consumer theory, general equilibrium, and so on. Since this is not my field, I am not completely sure how this paper differs from the preexisting literature on rational inattention, but it does seem quite general and ambitious. 

The primary source of the recent ruble collapse has almost certainly been the falling international oil price, aggravated by some other features of Russian politics and its economy. Petroleum products account for over half of Russia's export revenue, and most remaining export revenue comes from other commodities, whose output it cannot easily adjust. When oil prices fall, this lost export revenue must be replaced by some combination of (1) more (presumably non-oil) exports (2) fewer imports (3) a larger net capital inflow. For the most part, these adjustments will be made in response to an equilbrating decline in Russia's exchange rate. Since Russia's export mix is so commodity-heavy, the short run response of (1) to the exchange rate is very weak; since consumers tend to be sluggish in responding to price changes, (2) is weak in the short run as well. For a modern economy with good access to international capital markets, (3) is the main short-term buffer for shocks like these, but Russia is currently suffering from Western sanctions and was not particularly well-integrated into international capital markets in the first place. For all these reasons, a very large decline in the exchange rate is needed to induce enough of (1), (2), and (3) to offset the decline in oil export revenue. Meanwhile, skittishness about the political situation in Russia (and its dubious historical record on monetary stability) don't help. By the way, the dependence of commodity exporters' exchange rates on commodity prices is a staple of international finance; it has even been used to forecast commodity prices.
