Note: Thanissaro has translated similar to myself, using the translation "every world", which is similar to "all worlds". 

Suññatā means more or less not/non-self. Therefore, the instructions is the Anatta-Lakkhana Sutta may also be followed. In summary, to realise emptiness, as described in MN 121 (above), the mind first be made empty or clear. Then the clear mind can observe everything it observes is empty/vacant/void of any self. For example, if the mind observes a rock, cloud or tree, it can see clearly there is no 'self'/'ego' in a rock, cloud or tree. When the mind is clear, empty of thoughts & judgments, it can see the breathing & body are the same as a rock, cloud or tree, namely, empty of any self. Observing like this, the breathing will calm & feelings of rapture will arise, which are observed like a rock, cloud or tree, as empty of self. When rapture calms, the mind will be even clearer & all mental phenomena are observed the same as a rock, cloud or tree, as empty of self. This is how to realise emptiness. To realise not-self & emptiness, the mind must do vipassana. 

Note: I personally do not have a definite answer to this question, apart from personal speculation therefore I have asked the question for people to think about & answer. 

In conclusion, the teachers that teach against concentration do so because they have either never reached concentration or, otherwise, have achieved wrong concentration rather than right concentration. MN 117 explains these right & wrong factors. 

It should be noted this 'equinimity' is not the equinimity of the 4th jhana because the stream-enterer (1st path) has not reached the 4th jhana. 

My view is this sutta was not spoken by the Buddha because any sutta that includes the phrase: "I was [this person] at that time" is contrary to the principles found in SN 22.79. This type of sutta, of which there are only a few (eg. AN 3.15; MN 81, MN 123, etc), about literal past-lives is in the style of the Jataka Stories, Buddhavamsa & Apadana, which were written hundreds of years after the Buddha. This being said, the following is true: 

The idea that: "The citta is the essential knowing nature at the core of our being. It consists of pure and simple awareness: the citta simply knows" appears to be something taught by Northern Thai Forest Buddhism, which seems to have a preoccupation about the word 'citta'. This might be because common Thai people generally believe the 'vinnana' or 'viyan' or 'spirit' is that which reincarnates from life to life as part of their traditional animist spirit worship beliefs. Thus the Forest teachers may have focused on the Thai 'chit' rather than the Thai 'vinyan' so to not alienate ordinary Thai people. 

Males are superior. Males left their homes, lived in forests, attained enlightenment, started the religion, wandered & spread the religion, often at great danger to their lives. The women did not do this but came along later, demanding to join the men. If the women were equal, they would have started their own religion but they did not do this because women do not have the spiritual, moral &/or social authority to start their own religion that is respected by the world at large. The women joined the male Sangha and the men had to make many sacrifices in order for the women to be protected and live safely, so the Sangha would not fall into disrepute if women were harmed. In summary, the male monastic community is based on men that left the family life and women are always 'guests' or 'visitors' to this community. The Buddha (AN 6.52) taught the ideal of women is to dominate & want to be mothers. If women are given the freedom they want in the Sangha, they would want to act like mothers, lecture the monks, particularly the young monks, fault-find and the other behaviours women have the natural tendency to do because of their natural instincts to be mothers, nest-builders & housewives. This is contrary to the Dhamma, since the Dhamma is not the household life but a life of independence. Even today, we can witness new Buddhist nuns complaining & making demands like Western feminists rather than devoting their time to meditation practise (example, here). In summary, men do not need to push their superiority. Instead, they must uphold the monastic community so it does not degenerate from its essence. Even today, most nuns are teaching metta (love) & feminism (attachment) rather than emptiness (sunnata). The Vinaya states: 

The sutta below states whenever objects of consciousness are appropriated or 'stolen' to be "I", "me" & "mine", there will be inevitable punishment or suffering. 

Original Pali Buddhism does not teach about 'non-dualism'. Instead, it teaches about 'voidness' (selflessness; sunnata). 

In the Pali, many words, such as 'dukkha', 'dhamma', 'nirodha' & 'sankhara' have different meanings in different contexts thus, in each different context, must be translated differently & appropriately. The Buddha was fully enlightened thus perfectly coherent. There can be no contradictions in a Buddha's teachings. It is the famous translators & gurus who are misinterpreting the teachings. In summary, as shown in the quotes below, only the ‘dukkha’ of attachment & egoism is real ‘suffering’ (mental torment/trauma). The ‘unsatisfactoriness' of conditioned things (dukkha lakkhana) and painful feelings (dukkha vedana) are not suffering (unless they are attached to). Context 1 - Dukkha as suffering 

The idea that the Buddha had past lives is both a misinterpretation of the term 'pubbe nivasa' in the texts and a later doctrine manufactured in Buddhism (such as the Jataka Tales or Fables). The term 'pubbe nivasa' is unambiguously explained in SN 22.79 and refers to each time in the past the mind clung to one or more of the five aggregates as 'self' (i.e., 'past acquisitions'). As for getting sick & injured, this occurred to the Buddha. In his 1st noble truth, the Buddha summarised all suffering as attachment to the five aggregates, i.e., attaching to the five aggregates as 'self'. The idea that "sickness is suffering" is a misunderstanding of the teachings. Ordinarily, i.e., when unenlightened, sickness is suffering because it is a unpleasant experience that is a attached to. But when the physical pain of sickness is not attached to as "self", it is not suffering. Therefore, the Buddha was free from all suffering from when he attained enlightenment at 35 years old until the termination of life at 80 years old. For example, the scriptures say:
