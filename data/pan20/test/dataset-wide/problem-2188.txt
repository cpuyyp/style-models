I agree with the others that you don't need to mention your depression when you decline the offer. But before you reject the offer, consider if it might possibly be a blessing in disguise. This person already has a high opinion of you, so if you joined the company you wouldn't have that awkward phase of trying to prove yourself. Of course, all of this depends on how bad your depression is, whether or not you're getting treatment and getting it under control. You might even ask if you could work part-time. 

I always find starting new jobs to be very difficult. I love my current job, but the first six months were pretty miserable. I didn't feel like I fit in, it wasn't clear what I was meant to be doing, etc. So this may just be "new job jitters". In a way, it's a good sign that the reason you're unhappy is that you haven't had enough training, because that is a temporary problem. Even if the training situation doesn't improve, you will eventually learn the job. Nobody expects you to be good at your job after only two weeks, even if you've had excellent training. So try to go easier on yourself and expect to make mistakes. Talk to your supervisor about getting more training, and be open about how you're feeling (stressed out, worried you'll make mistakes etc.). Maybe they can arrange something. Or maybe they'll tell you you're doing fine, and they know it's going to take time for you to learn the job. Either way, it will probably make you feel better. Try to imagine how the job will be when you've learned what you need to learn. Do you think you will be satisfied with it? If so then I suggest you stick it out. If not, then maybe this isn't the right job for you, and you subconsciously realise it, and that's the real reason you're stressing out. Either way, try to look at the situation logically -- not ignoring your feelings, but balancing them against the facts. 

Others have speculated about why your boss is doing this, so instead I'll suggest a way to either reduce the number of times your boss asks you what you're doing, or at least make it easier for you to answer quickly: Keep a list of the various tasks you're working on in a visible place. Add stars to indicate high-priority tasks. When your boss asks, show him your list, tell him what you're currently doing, and tell him what you think you'll do next. One thing to be aware of: If a task stays on your list for what might seem like a long time, consider why that's happening. If it's because it's one of those tasks that spawns a lot of sub tasks, then you probably need to break down the task into smaller units so that you can demonstrate that you're making progress. Suppose the task is "fix the printer", but you're waiting for a part. Your to-do list might show that you've ordered the part for the printer, but it hasn't arrived yet. On the other hand, suppose the task is taking a long time because it's lower priority than your other tasks. When your boss asks about the printer, show him all the high-priority tasks with stars next to them, and ask him if he'd like you to change some task priorities. 

I suspect that the person contacting your employer won't tell them exactly why they need to verify your employment. Chances are the person making the call won't even know why; they just have a list of verification calls to get through. I'm sure there are other reasons why Canadian immigration might want to verify someone's employment. It could be a relative who wants to emigrate, or is in legal trouble there, or something like that. I wouldn't lie, though. If your boss does ask about it, I'd say something vague like "it's some family stuff". I'm assuming you're going to do the right thing and give your employer the proper notice. When you do give notice, try to make the transition as smooth as possible. I don't think you owe them any more than that. 

It may be that your relationship with your supervisor is unredeemable, but there's no reason to burn bridges with everyone else in the company. You never know, you may work with them again in the future, at another company. Assuming you are set upon resigning, I suggest you offer your resignation politely, also offering to work the notice period if they wish. At the same time, be sure to ask what the company will say if asked for a reference, and negotiate it if you're unhappy with the answer. 

You don't need to juggle the priorities, your boss does. Whenever they ask you to do work that wasn't assigned to you by your boss, say 

Either your first or last option is fine. These things happen, and any reasonable recruiter or HR person will understand. If you go with the first option, you can avoid looking inflexible by explaining that this trip was scheduled before you started job hunting. 

Perhaps you could meet her halfway? You could offer to buy a kitchen compost bin like this ($URL$ which should keep the smell in and prevent mould. Or you could make something similar. However, first I would let her know your plans. Otherwise she might see the new bin and think someone else has "claimed" this batch of coffee grounds. And she may offer to purchase it herself. 

Combining them as you have suggested should be fine. It also makes it extra clear that these were internships; you weren't job-hopping. Experienced recruiters will understand that your internships were during your undergraduate years, and intended to be short-term, but there would be no harm to add the phrase: Internships (while at Whatever University) 

I would not worry about the total number of years of experience adding up to more than the length of your career. Most projects involve multiple skills, so it's normal for that to happen. And it will be clear from other parts of the form exactly how long your career has been, so no one could think you're trying to hide something. 

I would not tell the new employee that they might get fired. You don't really know what management's plans are... perhaps management has learned from the previous situation and will handle this differently. And as you say, telling the new employee that they might be doomed may stress them out and affect their work, perhaps making this a self-fulfilling prophecy. And finally, you may get in trouble if management suspects that you did this. Instead, I would give the new employee whatever general, but helpful advice, that could help them succeed. For example I might say something like "you might want to start learning about XYZ; I recommend this book", or "sometimes these temporary tasks go on for a while; you might want to remind the boss that you're anxious to get started on real task". In other words, give him your mentoring and guidance to help him succeed, but without scaring him with your suspicions. 

As for the photo, why don't you just ask if you can take a picture of them there and then with your smartphone? Over and done with. 

It's neither bad news nor good news. The most likely scenario is that something came up, and one of the people involved in the interview has to be somewhere else at that time. Or they decided that another person should be involved in the interview, and that person has a schedule conflict. In other words, the change probably has nothing to do with you. 

I think there are two potential contracts in question here, and that's causing some confusion. Typically you would have signed a contract with the agency that hired you, and that would specify your vacation leave. You would have every right to see that contract, but apparently in this case there was no such contract. In that case, local employment laws probably specify the default conditions of employment. The agency should also have a contract with the people you are actually performing the work for. I would not expect you to be able to see that contract, because it is competition-sensitive. In any case, it's not your obligation to fulfill that contract; it's the agency's obligation. If they have to arrange cover for you during your leave, that's their problem, not yours. 

I agree with some of the other answers that you need to be a bit flexible about the tasks assigned to you. And if you've left 3 or 4 jobs in the last few years, maybe you've been too rigid about this. Or perhaps you've just had a run of bad luck. In any case, I'd also like to point out something that many people don't fully realise: an interview is for your benefit as well as the employer's benefit. When focusing on impressing a potential employer, interviewees often forget to make clear what their own expectations are. You want to be tactful so that people don't get the impression that you're a difficult employee. I might say something like this "My skills and interests are in unicorn training. Of course, I understand that from time to time you may need an employee to work on something other than what they are hired for. But if I were to join your company, how soon would you expect to put me on a unicorn training project?" Another way to ask would be "Are you looking for a full-time unicorn trainer, or someone who would do a bit of unicorn training, and a bit of dog training?" Listen carefully to the answers, and you'll have a better idea whether or not the job is right for you. 

I would tell Company A that you have an offer in writing from another company, and need to respond in a week. I've done the same in many occasions. Usually it has worked for me, and no one seemed offended, if that's your concern. Provided you are polite and professional, no one should be offended. However, if Company A is a big company (e.g., of international scale), it may not be possible for them to get the offer to you sooner. Sometimes the offer needs to be signed by busy execs who are traveling or on holiday (vacation). Sometimes hiring decisions are made by committees, and you have to wait for their next meeting. This sort of thing is frustrating, of course.
