Like Bakmoon said, this help your back muscles to strengthen over time. During the sitting posture you are breaking down the muscles the same way an athlete strengthens his or her whole body; and when you sleep the muscles rebuild and come back stronger than before. And like Bakmoon says, it will probably take a month or even several months. Your mind will learn to stop making it worse. By seeing the back pain just as it is (nothing more, nothing less), your aversion and thus your desire to avoid the pain will decrease. When your mind is not making the problem worse, the body will have more resources it can devote to healing and general upkeep. And then, if your back really needs something, you will probably see that more clearly too. 

Practice : Ven. Mahasi Sayadaw Is there any "Gatha" (Verse) can be used to contemplate on "Death"? The purpose is to use as an aid to generate necessary energy to continue practice [mostly as the first thing in the morning] 

Practice Ven . Mahasi Sayadaw tradition I spend most of my unproductive time (traveling , when nothing special to do ) on reading Dhamma books using my iPhone. These moments are not appropriate for sitting or walking meditation , so I follow "daily life" instructions can be found here $URL$ But when I try to make a clear thought "reading" while reading I find it interfere with reading . How should I use clear thoughts to be mindful when reading ? 

This is the way the mind is, uncontrollable. Acknowledge their presence and gently try to return to your usual object of meditation. If this fails, acknowledge the failure and gently try to return to your usual object of meditation. If you get frustrated, acknowledge the frustration, et cetera. Being gentle and acknowledging whatever comes are important. And if the thought is something you want to write down for creativity's sake, that's not a bad thing. It's also not a good thing. It just is what it is. Just leave it until meditation is finished. If you forget what the thought was, then you simply forget. It is what it is. If you practice this way, you will become less and less invested with the content of these thoughts, causing two things to happen: 

Now I want to be aware about myself while being absorbed in reading or be aware about the reader while reading Could anyone provide me a guide to proceed to that ? 

In five aggregates I'm bit confused when it says Perception and Consciousness are temporary . I can see form , feelings and formations are temporary by practice. Could someone provide me some more context to see this in practice ? 

How to overcome feeling bored while doing anapanasati meditation ? I get this feeling after setting sati at the end of the nose and body is calmed . 

And I found "- When you are aware of the taste, knowing" is extremely momentary compare to other steps (relatively longer when having a beverage like coffee or soft drink) . Sometimes I miss that step completely . How should I handle "intention"(cetanaha) of eating without "suppressing"? 

In my experience, group meditation gives one encouragement and adds a new dimension to one's practice. The sense of community is also helpful. A disadvantage of group meditation is that groups vary in their qualities and it might take a while to find the right group. I've tried 3 in my city, and only one have I been able to take seriously. They consider themselves Buddhist, and they apply it to their lives in an honest and genuine fashion. The meditation session is uncomplicated, consisting of beginning and ending chanting, a 50-minute sit with a break, and a short reading passage from some Buddhist literature. This group is affiliated with one of Ajahn Chah's monks. Of the other two, one was in it for the money, and didn't give me a feeling of community. The last one is sort of a secular mixed bag of traditions that doesn't seem to settle on any one practice. I have a slight preference to meditating alone, but I try to make it to my group's weekly meet when I can, as it provides me some consistency that I wouldn't otherwise have. 

There had been infinite number of Buddhas before and there will be many more. In this Kalpa, We already have four Buddhas and there will be one more Buddha. That's why this Kalpa is called Bhadda-kappa. Extracted it from here. 

Let's go back to the basic that every Buddhist knows. According to The Nine Special Qualities of the Buddha, there are 'The Six kinds of Speech'. Whether the speech is disagreeable to others or not, Buddha only speaks true AND beneficial. If you believe in it, Buddha mentioned 227 Patimokkha rules which are true and beneficial for monk. It is also beneficial for those who makes offerings to monks who live by those Patimokkha rules. Please look at Qualities of the Sangha also. 

Absolutely, it is possible to be incorrect about the notion that one was on the Buddhist path. I have had plenty of this sort of experience in my own meditation practice. Very frequently I would have unusual experiences in meditation, such as seeing lights, being filled with joy, a sense of time coming to a stop, etc. And I would ask my teacher what these experiences meant, hoping for this kind of answer or that kind of answer. Each time, he would tell me that these experiences don't mean anything and that I should focus on seeing these experiences as they are. While I wanted these experiences to return quite badly, I failed to recognize the fact that I wanted them to return. Entire meditation sessions were wasted waiting for the lights, or time stopping, etc. It is in this sense that I "thought I was on the path" but now know that I was somewhat stubbornly misleading myself. Well, try and try again. Although this example is from practice in a Theravadan context, the general principle should still translate to Mahayana practice or any kind of practiced skill: Sometimes it takes a lot of mistakes to realize you need a different approach. This is definitely the case for me.
