It might even be better than standing it on the same patch of tyres, if it's not being ridden at all, especially if you're not checking the tyre pressures. 

Although you can get replacement pins for (many) chains, and I suggest you use them, I suspect that's not quite what you're looking for. I wouldn't want to break the same link again even if the pin was new. A diamond scriber (amazon link as an example) can be used to write on steel, and if you make a clear, distinctive mark it will be easy to spot on a clean chain. You can go further and scribe then apply a dab of paint into the scratch, but you could probably just paint in the manufacturer's stamp more easily than that. If you have a chain that's plated against corrosion this might not be a good idea, but most plating is cosmetic on the visible faces. If paint is your preferred solution there are touch up paint pens for cars that are small, cheap, hard wearing and long lasting. 

Changing the rim sizes on both wheels is likely to be expensive even if it's possible. If you really want both wheels the same size, you should probably keep the 18" and change the 20" to 18". If you really want 16" wheels (it might be a good idea to tell us why as there may be an alternative) it could be cheaper to replace the bike given the difficulties around brakes. This is especially true as there's suspension you don't want. 

The key is going to be how you felt after those 20km rides. Assuming you were OK, the longer ride should be fine though you'll be tired and you'll ache in unexpected places. If you had any pain on the short rides you need to deal with that first - probably by adjusting the bike. Going from a 1 hour to a 2 hour ride (roughly, assumed times) you may well want to carry (more) water and an energy snack just in case. 

I doubt you're getting snake bites in a 22mm tyre unless it's very low on air. Even then it's not likely. Snake bites have a distinctive two-hole pattern so you can check. It's more likely that you're getting ordinary punctures. There may be tough 22mm tyres, but most this thin are designed to be light. There are certainly anti-puncture options at 25mm which should fit, but may be a touch slower. 

Depending on your backpack you may be able to lash it to the outside. I've carried bike wheels this way. I've also carried 10-15kg backpacks while riding, so know it takes some care. You might have to ride quite gently but that's OK over 3 km. I'd probably have the sack sideways across the backpack, rather than vertical, as it's less likely to slip between the straps. Buying a bigger backpack might be a good idea if this is going to become a habit. The backpack I used has straps on the outside running from bottom to top, so a big load can be held between them and the backpack itself. An additional side-to-side strap/rope is a good idea. If you think it feels like it's started moving, get off and have a look. Alternatively, don't take the bike, walk with the sack on your shoulder. 

Maybe this will jog someone's memory, or maybe you can look around for ones that use a similar construction but the usual spherical washer arrangement for alignment. Alternatively if you're prepared to use the spacers you bought already, you might be able to make them work on these pads, as you don't need nearly so much male thread for the alignment. You may need extra nuts/spacers, and a lot of care and threadlocker -- I'd be cautious about extending the thread giving that you're relying on a single point fixing to stop you. 

* Both carbon fibre and titanium saddle rails exist and are strong. However they're usually used to make bikes light rather than strong and are unlikely to be available for anything other than road saddles (comfort was specified).m Their brittle failure modes (carbon in particular) make them a bad choice in this case of unusally high stress. 

Are your cranks tight? You should grease the tapers well before tightening, it allows the crank to slide on fully, and tighten properly. If you can't remove your crank (no tools) then tighten, and then retighten several times after riding for a while. If the taper is dry, it won't tighten fully first try. If you ride with a loose crank for a while, it can reshape the aluminium, until it becomes impossible to tighten successfully - so do tighthen it. 

The two pinch bolts (on the back side of the stem) hold the stem on, and perform two separate effects 

I got an 8 speed no-name shifter off Aliexpress to convert a bike from 9 to 8 speed. It's made of a metal like substance and works fine with shimano d√©railleur for $10 

Don't need to remove to oil these pedals. Lean your bike over to the side, pedal facing to ground. Run oil down the pedal shaft into the pedal bearing - spin the pedal on the shaft, and the oil will wick into the gap between the metal and the plastic. More oil until it is free and quiet. A thickish oil - wet-ride ride chainlube, Chainsaw oil, or thin motor oil is probably ideal. Put (thin) oil on the thread end of the pedal shaft, hoping it will wick in (back side of the crank arm), this helps keep it from rusting up for when you do need to remove it. 

The top bolt is for setting the pre-load of the steering bearings. BUT once the pinch bolts are tightened, it does nothing, as the stem is now clamped in place. You cannot tighten the bearings UNTIL you loosen the pinch bolts. If you loosen the pinch bolts, then you should check that the bearings are still set right. If you try to tighten the bearings by cranking down the centre bolt without loosening the pinch bolts, then you pull the star washer up or you can shear it, as it is only an M6. 

Only thing is they have two types of release Style B is the original (and seems more common). The button hits your shoe sole as the crank rotates, and chews it up. (well if you have wide feet) Get Style C with the round release. You need to grease the insert point, it will wear if dry. 

For future reference, I put two labels with name and phone number on the bike. One on the handlebar stem, for easy finding, and easy removal by thieves. One under the bottom bracket by the serial number, where the police will find it if it ever comes their way, and where thieves won't notice. Quite common for bikes to be borrowed, then abandoned. Also had a few bikes secured/moved by well-meaning janitors or others. In both these cases a label might help the bike find its way home. 

Creaking as you pedal can also come from almost anywhere in your bike, the sound carries through the frame. It can be so annoying! My seat sometimes creaks horribly, and you would swear it comes from the pedals. I think it is probably a crack in the plastic inside. Also my rear disk makes a creak that is in time with the pedaling. I have also had the steering stem / handlebar clamp do it too. 

This isn't making sense. The cone holds the balls in place. The locknuts (not shown) keep the cones in place. The grease seal has no effect on the tightness of the bearing. If your cone is moving, you have not tightened the locknut against the cone (or it has been omitted). You need a cone spanner (thin spanner) and a second spanner, to tighten the locknut hard against the cone. It is a bit tricky to tighten cones - or more accurately, you will find yourself having to redo it a few times to get it correct. Correct is when there is a tiny amount of play, that disappears when the quick-release is tightened. Check for play after a few days, and readjust if needed. 

I would suggest you tighten the inner nuts but not too much, as it would kinda block the wheel. You need to try and find the perfect spot for the nuts by trial and error(the wheel no moving at all horizontally). I had this problem once and all I did was put the wheel on the frame when it's upside down and spin it while I tightened the inner nuts of the axle. Then I would check if the wheel would still be moving horizontally. If in any case you overtightened the inner nuts on the axle and the wheel won't move try untightening them. These nuts have a tendency to untighten themselves so if you see the wheel moving again it the future don't worry, it's normal, just repeat the process I told you. 

I believe that you should increase tension of the rear derailleur cable by untightening the nut on the derailleur and pulling the cable with fair power while locking it back. You should only do that when the chain is in the smallest cog on the cassette and the bolt for the cable is all screwed in. After that if needed adjust the high and low bolts and the third bolt that is for the distance of the derailleur to the cassette. This distance should be around 6mm. Also unscrew the bolt of the cable if gear shifting is of poor quality. 

I think the problem is with the bottom bracket. Sometimes, when the crank arms are removed, they can be put back really badly, thus causing the pedaling system to be very hard. Or some other times it's just the bottom bracket that needs to be replaced. Once I replaced my bottom bracket, the pedaling system was better than ever! 

Should I buy a carbon fibre handebar or an aluminium alloy one for a mountain bike? I would prefer the stiffest, as I do tricks but I don't really know which one is the stiffest. I seen both aluminum as well as carbon fiber handlebars for under 20bucks. Then, should I go for a curved or a flat handlebar? I ride in town, I am about 1.80m tall. I am a male at about 65 kgs also doing work outs. This is neither to skinny nor to fat. I believe its ideal. I do not make huge jumps, just some drops from less than half a meter. I also believe the handlebar should be large at about 70cm in length, so that I can have a lot of grip when doing my tricks. Ps.I wouldn't do any barspins, so I dont care about the length. I just do some hops, bunny hops, manuals, endos, etc. No backflips or frontflips or any stuff like that. Now what is your opinion on my case? Edit: I really much like the design of the carbon fibre handebar whereas the aluminium handlebar is plain paint with a name on it. For the carbon fibre handebar it says that is has passed the EN 14766 Standards and the JAPAN JIS Standards. What to you think? 

I don't think gt ever made a bmx frame, but should it have, it would be one of a kind to celebrate something, for instance a racer that finished first. So they designed it for a purpose. I would advice you to get informed whether or not this is a gt bmx frame. 

Sometimes the chain can make contact to the derailleur and so make a noise. Sadly, there are certain gears one should travel. These include everything except the combination of a small cog back with big cog front, small cog front with big cog back. If the derailleur are poorly adjusted, this can be the cause of the chain having some friction with the derailleurs. There are two solutions. Either you do not ride in these gears or you have it properly adjusted. 

So I have this crank that I want to convert. It has three crankwheels and I don't expect myself to ride on the two of them. I have found a second hand crankwheel from a friend that I want to put on so that my life gets easier but I need the "plates" or I don't know how they are called to come off. As I can see there is a bolt for a hex but when I put it in to turn it and remove it, it does nothing. From the back side of it, it seems to be a rivet. Ps. I don't have enough money for a new crankset if this is what you are suggesting. I just need the crankwheels to come off.
