This is supplemental information to further clarify the answer. The drawing is confusing to me an likely to others. I've written a color filter in Python to help isolate only four of the boundaries. 

tl;dr Has the brown dwarf observation been disproven? I have just started reading about the interesting object V471 Tauri. The first two sentences of the introduction to The V471 Tauri System: A Multi-datatype Probe Vaccaro et al. (2015):

where reference 1 is Jonathan Pritchard and Abraham Loeb (2012) 21 cm cosmology in the 21st century. From there I've found Leonid Chuzhoy and Zheng Zheng (2007) Radiative Transfer Effect on Ultraviolet Pumping of the 21 cm Line in the High-Redshift Universe. I understand some basics about the hyperfine transition in hydrogen, and that the "spin temperature" of a gas in space can differ from the temperature of other partitions if it's being pumped, but these papers are more than a bit hard to read. Is there a simple way to explain the basics behind how the exposure of hydrogen to the UV light produced in early stars would cause the "blip" in the (now red-shifted) 21 cm part of the Cosmic Microwave Background radiation spectrum we see today? 

It's a track about 50 pixels long, at 4.1 $\mu m$ per pixel that's 200 $\mu m$ in the plane of the sensor. It's about 1 pixel wide, quite lumpy, and seems to change direction a bit. It really fits the description of an ionizing particle. There are multiple possible sources, I'm pretty sure @JamesK has nailed it as an electron, but what else can we learn? There must be some way to get a very rough idea of how many $e^- h^+$ pairs correspond to a fully exposed pixel at "@ISO1600", then we could convert it to a dE/dx and see if it's minimum ionizing or if it's much higher. Going diagonally, with a density of 2.3 g/cm${}^3$ that's about 1.3 mg/cm${}^2$ areal density per pixel. A [minimum ionizing particle] at 1.5 MeV / g cm${}^2$ would deposit only about 2000 eV which would make less than 1000 $e^- h^+$ pairs. That might correspond to a bright pixel. It's not out of the question that it's a minimum ionizing particle. 

And here is a NASA/JPL image from $URL$ for 2016-10-19 04:00 UT, which if I uderstand correctly is not actually a photograph, but simulated from LRO data. It also illustrates that the terminator is expected to be graded from light to dark and contain contrast from shadowing. 

In the video linked in the Space.com article What Would It Mean for Astronomers If the WFIRST Space Telescope Is Killed?, (available in YouTube as WFIRST: The Best of Both Worlds) after NASA astrophysicist Neil Gehrels says of WFIRST: 

How was the "redness" of 2014 MU69 detected? The second link mentions that it is Hubble data - is it just photometric (images through different filters) or is there also spectroscopy? I'm curious, just how red is it? What exactly are the numerical data that are being interpreted as "redness"? Is this exclusively the assumed visual appearance, or is there excess infrared as well? Also, I wasn't sure if 2014 MU69 is considered a comet or an asteroid. So far everything I've read just calls it a Kuiper Belt Object (KBO). So I've used both tags. 

Wikipedia lists the star Ross 128 at at declination of about , and the latitude of the Arecibo telescope to be about . Satellites in geostationary orbits are in a circular ring approximately coincident with the equator at a distance from the center of the Earth of only about 42,000 km. From the Northern hemisphere, geostationary satellites will appear several degrees south in declination. (See this interesting answer.) For Arecibo, I calculate about declination. QUESTION: How could a radio telescope have picked up satellite signals from a satellite at about declination while observing a star at declination? And why wasn't this immediately ruled out - surely radio telescopists know about satellites by now, especially the crowded ring of geostationary satellites! Aren't there standard procedures to rule these out before making announcements? Could the half-angle acceptance really have been 4 degrees? Since the brown red dwarf is extremely close to the solar system, could proper motion put it 4 degrees away from the value listed in Wikipedia?

The eoPortal article for TESS (Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite) gives a fairly in-depth summary of the space telescope design and planned operation. Some further background information on its observation mode and orbit can be found in the video linked below. Based on the caption (also shown below), I'm guessing that "star noise" is possibly related to shot noise; the counting statistics of the incoming photons or perhaps the photoelectrons thereby produced, and "sky noise" is the cumulative effect of all the other actual light present in the spatially binned area of a given star, including Zodiacal light within the solar system as well as all other sources. If so, and even if not, I don't really understand the units of $\sigma$ as parts per million per square-root hours, and why sky noise would vary as $I^{-1}$ while star noise expressed in these units varies as $I^{-1/2}$, where $I$ is the intensity of the light from a given star. below: Figure 12: Top: Expected 1Ïƒ photometric precision as a function of stellar apparent magnitude in the IC band. Contributions are from photon-counting noise from the target star and background (zodiacal light and unresolved stars), detector read noise (10 e-), and an assumed 60 ppm of incorrigible noise on hourly timescales.

If you imagine a band along the galactic equator the dominant velocity shows two positive and two negative "peaks", with a zero crossing in the direction of the galactic center. Purely for fun I wanted to see if I could reproduce this behavior with a simple calculation based on a 2D calculation assuming circular motion and a radial density distribution $\rho(r)$ which I could then use to figure out a rotational velocity distribution $v(r)$, bun I swiftly realized that I have no idea what the density profile would look like. 

and in the Space.com article Not Aliens: Weird Radio Signal from Star Likely Has Duller Explanation: 

I didn't find a focal ratio. I'd like to understand why the 2007 image is so "gaussian fuzzy". If it were only because of larger pixel spacing it would look more blockish or pixellated. Does this mean it was using a different optical path with lower optical resolution? Is the 2007 image from the WFC part at F/12.9? Does the WFC3 use F/28.3? I also don't understand the optical reason why different paths would have different optical resolutions. This would not come from different Airy disks from simple diffraction - the angular size would be unchanged. above: cropped sections from the same image shown below.

This nifty answer describes and provides links to the data of the recovery of near earth object 2012 TC4, and the answer also shows the first actual image of the body for this pass. At apparent magnitude +27 (at about 52 million km) it may be the faintest asteroid to have been imaged to date. It's worth visiting that answer first before reading on here. This comment points out that 2012 TC4 appears on the Goldstone Asteroid Schedule, a list of upcoming planned observations of asteroids by antennas at the Deep Space Network. Here are the entries for 2012 TC4 in the and tables: 

In this part of the image, without knowing a lot about meteorite taxonomy but a little bit about error bars, the image alone doesn't convince me of much at all by itself. There are good mathematical techniques to try to find clustering in data, and probably some methodologies to apply to calculate the probability that the clustering is likely to arise by random chance or is likely to be "real" (which is just another way to say - albeit loosely - not likely to arise by random chance). 

I have lifted the text below from my currently unanswered question, (to which I've just added a bounty) Did Rosetta improve on models of non-gravitational effects on comet 67P's orbit? in another SE site. Based on the current unclearness of the distinction between comets and asteroids as discussed in @zephyr's colorful answer I'm going to leave it as is. (Is this object an asteroid or comet, and how can it produce so many tails? and its answer are also worth a look.) Objects "formerly known as" asteroids will not outgas as much as those known as comets, but the math and background may be helpful as an additional answer here. Of course @HDE's answer is nice and concise and to the point. The Yarkovsky and Poynting-Robertson effects are mentioned below as well. It's clear these are included in the modeling of at least some asteroids, and comets. 

The resonance they discovered means that for a moderate period of time (at least tens of millions of years) the relative motion between Neptune and Pluto will be repetitive, with $3\times T_{Neptune} \approx 2\times T_{Pluto}$. The paper cited in the other excellent answer is the report of this discovery by Cohen and Hubbard in 1965 mentioned here. Figure 5 of that paper shows the motion of Neptune and Pluto in a rotating frame. The frame rotates with the average orbital rotation of Neptune, so over very long times you can see Neptune slowly rocks back and forth a bit: 

This is a simple explanation to give a basic understanding as to why the solar system rotates. It's caused by gravity and velocity. If you put two objects with mass in space a distance apart and at rest, they will accelerate directly toward each other, until kerpow! they hit. But, if they have some small, random relative velocity to begin with that's not directly toward or away from each other, then no amount of acceleration toward each other will zero that out. It means they will pass each other at some finite distance and keep going. If the random velocity is low enough, this dance will repeat and they will move in elliptical orbits around their center of mass. This kind of motion can be expresses in terms of its angular momentum and in this example (as in most) it is going to be a conserved quantity, so it's always going to be there. So when things in the universe like solar systems or galaxies initially form, they have some random, residual, collective motion, and this angular momentum in the center of mass frame of whatever blob is coalescing doesn't go away. Objects in the solar system keep rotating because there's no other option, at least in the short term. If there was a large amount of gas in the solar system, that might slow things down a bit, and there is a teeny tiny loss of energy due to gravitational waves, although for planets this is so extremely small it can be ignored. But basically the "wheels" of the celestial sphere are well lubricated and solar system bodies will continue in their orbits for millions and perhaps billions of years because there's nothing we know about right now to stop them. 

This recent HST image of Jupiter near opposition is described here and here and was made under HST proposal 14756. It was taken with WFC3/UVIS. It is made from three images using narrow-band filters at 395, 502, and 631 nanometers. I am wondering if there were additional images recorded with filters at other wavelengths. If so, how could I go about finding them? 

This nice video musing about (among other things) the US Naval Observatory's $3,500 expedition to Baker City or at least Baker County Oregon to observe the June 18, 1918 solar eclipse, there is a photograph of the expedition showing both normal-sized portable telescopes, and in the background a very long telescope (at least 6 meters, can't see the end) held up by a ladder, with an even longer tent extending backward from the shack sitting at the bottom of the telescope along the ground. What is this instrument? How does it function optically, and what kind of data does it produce? 

The BBC article Event Horizon Telescope ready to image black hole describes the Event Horizon Telescope, a coordinated observing technique with several radio telescope arrays across the globe forming a synthetic aperture with an Earth-sized baseline. $$\frac{\lambda}{r_{Earth}} \sim \frac{r_{Sag A*}}{D_{Sag A*}} \sim 10^{-11}$$ ...when plugging in 1 millimeter for $\lambda$, and with $r_{Sag A*}$ and $D_{Sag A*}$ the radius of, and distance from Earth to Sagittarius A*, the black hole in the center of the Milky Way Galaxy of 20 million km and 26,000 light years, respectively. (values taken from the article). The equation I've written shows that millimeter wavelength interferometry with an Earth-sized baseline has the possibility to resolve the existence of some structure with scale of the black hole's event horizon. My question is How does the Event Horizon Telescope implement the interferometry? It would certainly be impossible to bring all signals together to a central site and perform the interference there in real time as down-converted analog signals, and quite difficult/expensive to do it with dedicated, synchronized digital optical fiber lines. Is the massive amounts of data sent as IP packets over the internet to a central correlator (numerical interferometer)? The article mentions atomic clocks and lots of hard drives, and I have a hunch these have something to do with it.
