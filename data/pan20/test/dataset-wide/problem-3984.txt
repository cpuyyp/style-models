This is answered by Proposition 1.7 in [Auslander, Maurice; Reiten, Idun. Homologically finite subcategories. Representations of algebras and related topics (Kyoto, 1990), 1--42, London Math. Soc. Lecture Note Ser., 168, Cambridge Univ. Press, Cambridge, 1992.], 

An "order two sequence" is a sequence of morphisms such that the composition of any two consecutive morphisms is the zero morphism. At the point you are asking about in Waldhausen's paper, the condition is then $\kappa \circ \iota=0$ (which always holds by the definition of completed splitting diagram).

Q1: Ringel defined, for any given quasi-hereditary algebra $\Lambda$, a particular tilting-cotilting module called the characteristic tilting module. (It is a tilting module in the generalized sense, the projective dimension can be larger than one.) This characteristic tilting module has both a standard and a costandard filtration. Due to a slight misunderstanding, Donkin used the name 'tilting module' for the summands of this particular module. It was a useful concept, and since then this has become the definition used in some parts of representation theory. The two definitions are almost never equivalent, since for any given algebra there are usually many different tilting modules in the original sense. For instance is $\Lambda$ itself always a tilting module. Q3: There is a concept called Wakamatsu tilting module (see Handbook of Tilting Theory, page 207) where you leave out condition 1), keep condition 2), and in condition 3) replace the sequence with a possibly infinite coresolution. 

Link According to Theorem 3.1, the algebra $A$ is standardly stratified if and only if $$\operatorname{Ext}^{2}_A(\hat \Delta_i, \nabla_j)=0$$ for all $1 \leq i,j \leq n$. 

Here is a counter-example to (c) for the semi-simple, but not simple, algebra $\mathfrak{so}_4$. Projectives and Vermas are described in [Brüstle, Th.; König, S.; Mazorchuk, V. The coinvariant algebra and representation types of blocks of category $\scr O$. Bull. London Math. Soc. 33 (2001), no. 6, 669--681]. The self-dual projective with their notation looks like $$\begin{matrix} && d &&\\ & b && c\\ d && a && d\\ & c && b\\ && d &&\\ \end{matrix}$$ (Here $$\begin{matrix} d &&&&\\ & c &&&\\ && d &&\\ \end{matrix}$$ is a submodule, as can be seen from the quiver presentation given in that paper.) If we quotient out $\Delta_c$, then the radical filtration looks like $$\begin{matrix} && d &&\\ & b && c\\ d && a && d\\ &&& b &\\ \end{matrix}$$ so the lengths of radical layers in the quotient are $1$ $2$ $3$ $1$. But the socle of this quotient has length $2$ (the left-most 'd' belongs to the socle), so the socle layers are different from the radical layers in this example. 

For the finitistic dimension, this is Theorem 16 in Samuel Eilenberg, Alex Rosenberg, and Daniel Zelinsky, MR 98774 On the dimension of modules and algebras. VIII. Dimension of tensor products, Nagoya Math. J. 12 (1957), 71--93. 

Here's how to construct a counterexample to the last question. It's quite easy to introduce a direction to the complete bipartite graph $K_{6,6}$ such that (a) every vertex has outdegree $3$ and (b) the graph has the dominance property on pairs of non-adjacent vertices. One possible orientation of the $36$ edges is as follows: $$\begin{bmatrix} + & + & + & - & - & -\\ + & - & - & + & + & -\\ + & - & + & - & - & +\\ - & + & - & + & - & +\\ - & + & - & - & + & +\\ - & - & + & + & + & -\\ \end{bmatrix}$$ (I left out the drawing, because it was too much of a mess.) This directed graph has no oriented triangles since it is bipartite. Now replace every vertex in $K_{6,6}$ with an oriented $4$-cycle, so the total number of vertices becomes $12 \times 4 =48$ (and the number of edges is $36 \times 16+4 \times 12=624$). The newly constructed graph has the dominance property on all pairs of vertices and also contains no oriented triangles. 

(I think you are also assuming $M$ indecomposable? If not, there are easy counterexamples with the Kronecker algebra.) It is enough to prove the claim for $M$ indecomposable projective for the following reasons: Every other indecomposable preprojective module is of the form $\tau^{-n}P$ for some $n \geq 0$ and $P$ indecomposable projective. As long as we stay away from the preinjective component, the translate $\tau^{-1}$ preserves exact sequences [Auslander, Reiten, Smalø, "Representation Theory of Artin Algebras", Lemma VIII.4.4]. $\tau^{-1}$ also sends indecomposables to indecomposables and regular simples to regular simples. In the $\tilde {\mathbb A}_n$ case the claim follows from string algebra combinatorics. One reference for string algebras is [Butler, Ringel, "Auslander-Reiten sequences with few middle terms and applications to string algebras"]. You can construct an irreducible monomorphism from $M$ into a larger string module by adding a "right hook" (or "left hook"). The cokernel is a uniserial string module which is a regular simple module. I don't have a general proof for the $\tilde {\mathbb D}_n$ case, but your example sequence together with the sequences similar to $$0 \longrightarrow \begin{smallmatrix} & 1 & & \cr 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \end{smallmatrix} \longrightarrow \begin{smallmatrix} & 2 & & \cr 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 \end{smallmatrix} \longrightarrow\begin{smallmatrix} & 1 & & \cr 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 \end{smallmatrix} \longrightarrow 0$$ shows that it is true for $\tilde {\mathbb D}_4$ with your chosen orientation. 

Another construction is the preprojective algebra of a Dynkin quiver (a quiver such that the underlying graph is Dynkin). Such an algebra is Frobenius but not in general symmetric, see for instance Erdmann, Karin; Snashall, Nicole, On Hochschild cohomology of preprojective algebras. I. 

(There is a misprint in the statement of the proposition. It should say $R=\operatorname{rad} P$.) You cannot get the result in green because it's false (in general). For example if the algebra is $$A=\begin{bmatrix} \mathbb C & \mathbb C & \mathbb C\\ 0 & \mathbb C & \mathbb C\\ 0 & 0 & \mathbb C \end{bmatrix}$$ and $P$ is the unique (up to isomorphism) indecomposable projective-injective module, then the monomorphism $u=\begin{bmatrix} q \\ i \end{bmatrix} \colon R \rightarrow R/S \oplus P$ is a counterexample. In this example there are no non-zero morphisms form $P$ to $R/S$, so $u$ cannot factor through $P$. The proof of the proposition can be saved by assuming $U$ is indecomposable. The authors want to prove $\begin{bmatrix} q \\ i \end{bmatrix}$ is left almost split. In other words, whenever $u \colon R \to U$ is not a section, one needs to show that $u$ factors through $\begin{bmatrix} q \\ i \end{bmatrix}$. As pointed out above, it suffices to consider the case when $U$ is indecomposable. If $u \colon R \to U$ is a monomorphism, then, since $P$ is injective, there is a morphism $h \colon U \to P$ such that $i=hu$. 

If $Q$ is the quiver $A_n$ with linear orientation, then the Stasheff associahedron appears as the polytope with vertices the basic tilting $kQ$-modules and faces the faithful basic exceptional $kQ$-modules. The partial order on faces is defined by $M \leq N$ whenever $N$ is a a direct summand of $M$. This gives a poset isomorphic to the one in your first example.

Suppose $M=M_1 \oplus \dots \oplus M_r$ with $M_i$ indecomposable for $1 \leq i \leq r$. Let $\mathcal F (M_1, \dots, M_r)$ denote the category of modules which admit a filtration with subquotients in the $M_i$. The crucial assumption in Keller's proof is that $\mathcal F(M_1, \dots, M_r)$ is closed under syzygies. With this assumption, any $n$-fold extension ($n>1$) $$\xi \in \operatorname{Ext}^n(M_u,M_v) \simeq \operatorname{Ext}^1(\Omega^{n-1}(M_u),M_v)$$ with $1 \leq u,v \leq r$ is the Yoneda splice of $n$ short-exact sequences $$0 \to X_{i+1} \to E_i \to X_i \to 0 \quad (0 \leq i \leq n-1)$$ where $X_0=M_u$, $X_n=M_v$, and each $X_i$ is an object in $\mathcal F(M_1, \dots, M_r)$ for $0 \leq i \leq n$. As explained in the article you mentioned, the category $\mathcal F(M_1, \dots, M_r)$ is equivalent to a category of twisted stalks. A twisted stalk can be described as a pair $(B,\delta)$, where $B$ is a sequence of subfactors from $\{M_1, \dots, M_r\}$ and $\delta$ is an upper triangular matrix with entries from $\operatorname{Ext}^1(M,M)$. If $X_i$ corresponds to a twisted stalk $(B,\delta)$ and $X_{i+1}$ corresponds to a twisted stalk $(B',\delta')$, then the short-exact sequence $0 \to X_{i+1} \to E_i \to X_i \to 0$ corresponds to a morphism of twisted complexes $(B,\delta) \to (B',\delta')[1]$. Such a morphism is a matrix with entries from $\operatorname{Ext}^1(M,M)$. So each short-exact sequence $0 \to X_{i+1} \to E_i \to X_i \to 0$ can be described using only the $\operatorname{Ext}^1$ part of $\operatorname{Ext}^\ast(M,M)$. The higher multiplications enter the picture when we splice the short-exact sequences together. The rule for composing morphisms of twisted complexes involves $m_2$ and higher multiplications of the matrices involved. When splicing all the short-exact sequences together, we end up with an expression for $\xi \in \operatorname{Ext}^n(M_u,M_v)$ using only elements in $\operatorname{Ext}^1(M,M)$ and $m_2$ and higher multiplications. This shows that $\operatorname{Ext}^\ast(M,M)$ is generated in degree $0$ and $1$ as an $A_\infty$-algebra. A class of examples where the assumption is satisfied is when $\{M_1, \dots, M_r\}$ are the standard modules over a quasi-hereditary algebra. 

The answer is no (in general) according to B. L. Osofsky, Global dimension of valuation rings, Corollary 3. For any $1 \leq n \leq \infty$, there are examples where $$\sup \{ {\rm{id}}(M) \mid M \text{ is a cyclic $R$-module} \}=1$$ and ${\rm{lD}}(R)=n$. 

If $A$ is a commutative local artinian ring which is not a field, and $I \neq 0$ is the maximal ideal in $A$, then no such modules exist. In this case every $A$-module has projective dimension $0$ or $\infty$, see for instance (Bass, Hyman. Finitistic dimension and a homological generalization of semi-primary rings). By a theorem of Kaplansky, any projective module over a local ring is free. Suppose $M$ is a non-zero $A$-module with $\operatorname{pd} (M)=0$. Since $I$ is nilpotent, we cannot have $IM=M$. Then $M/IM$ is a non-zero module annihilated by $I$, so it cannot be free. Therefore $\operatorname{pd} (M/IM)=\infty$. 

Local finite dimensional algebras have only trivial tilting modules since in that case all finitely generated modules have either zero or infinite projective dimension. In particular it follows that commutative finite dimensional algebras have only trivial tilting modules. 

Here is a slightly silly example of a non-trivial ring homomorphism $M_{n+1}(R)\rightarrow M_n(R)$ with $R$ noncommutative. Let $R=\mathbb C \times M_2(\mathbb C)$. Then there is a ring homomorphism $M_2(R)\rightarrow M_1(R)$ sending the ideal $M_2(M_2(\mathbb C)) \subseteq M_2(R)$ to $0$ and $M_2(\mathbb C) \subseteq M_2(R)$ isomorphically to $0 \times M_2(\mathbb C)$. There might be more interesting examples based on this idea. 

In the Dynkin case, Gabriel's theorem states that the indecomposable representations are in a one-to-one correspondence with the positive roots of the root system of the Dynkin diagram. You can read about it for instance in chapter VII of Ibrahim Assem, Daniel Simson, and Andrzej Skowronski, MR 2197389 Elements of the representation theory of associative algebras. Vol. 1, ISBN: 978-0-521-58423-4; 978-0-521-58631-3; 0-521-58631-3. The Euclidean case is treated in chapter XIII of Elements of the representation theory of associative algebras. Vol. 2 by the same authors (can't find it with the citation helper). Quote: 

The preprojective algebra of an ADE graph is non-symmetric Frobenius, so the injective hull of $s_i$ is isomorphic to the indecomposable projective module $$\mathcal P e_{\phi(i)},$$ where $\phi$ is the inverse of the Nakayama permutation. For preprojective algebras of ADE graphs the Nakayama permutation is either the identity or it has order two, and it is given as follows. In type $\mathsf {A_n}$: the unique graph automorphism of order two. In type $\mathsf {D_n}$: the identity if $n$ is even and the unique graph automorphism of order two if $n$ is odd. In type $\mathsf {E_6}$: the unique graph automorphism of order two. In type $\mathsf {E_7}$ and $\mathsf {E_8}$: the identity.

In particular $\operatorname{Tr}\Omega\operatorname{Tr}$ is a left adjoint of $\Omega$. Here $\operatorname{Tr} \colon R\text{-}\underline{\text{mod}} \to R^{\operatorname{op}}\text{-}\underline{\text{mod}}$ denotes the transpose, if $M$ is an $R$-module with projective presentation $$P_1 \to P_0 \to M \to 0,$$ then $\operatorname{Tr} M=\operatorname{coker} (\operatorname{Hom}_R(P_0,R) \to \operatorname{Hom}_R(P_1,R))$. 

But by Proposition 3.5, since $P$ is indecomposable projective, $i \colon R \to P$ is an irreducible morphism, meaning that in the factorization $i=hu$ either $u$ is a section or $h$ is a retraction. It is assumed $u$ is not a section, so $h$ must be a retraction. Since $U$ is indecomposable, it follows that $h$ is an isomorphism. So $u=h^{-1}i$ and therefore $u$ factors through $P$. 

Let $e$ be the idempotent in $B$ such that $Be$ is the direct sum of the $n-l$ indecomposable projective-injectives which do not have projective proper submodules. Then the two-sided ideal $BeB=Be$ is projective as a left $B$-module, so $B \to B/BeB$ is a homological epimorphism, see for instance Koenig, Steffen; Nagase, Hiroshi, Hochschild cohomology and stratifying ideals., J. Pure Appl. Algebra 213, No. 5, 886-891 (2009). ZBL1181.16009. This means that $\operatorname{Ext}^*_{B/BeB}(M,N) \cong \operatorname{Ext}^*_B(M,N)$ for all $B/BeB$-modules $M$ and $N$. We also have an isomorphism of algebras $B/BeB \cong A_l$. 

Here is a counterexample. Let $\Bbbk$ be a field and let $A=\Bbbk [x_0,x_1,x_2,\ldots]$ be the polynomial ring in countably many variables with its natural grading. Consider the ideal $I$ generated by $\{x_i x_j \mid i,j\in \mathbb N, i \neq j\}$, $\{x_i^2-x_j^2 \mid i,j\in \mathbb N, i \neq j\}$ and all monomials of degree three. In short $$I=\langle x_i x_j, x_i^2-x_j^2,A_3\rangle.$$ Then $M=A/I$ is an $A$-module with an induced grading $M=M_0 \oplus M_1 \oplus M_2$, and all submodules of $M$ have a non-zero intersection with the simple socle $\operatorname{Soc} M=M_2$. Therefore $M$ has uniform dimension one. On the other hand $M/\operatorname{Soc} M$ is isomorphic to $A/\langle A_2 \rangle$ which has an infinite dimensional socle $M_1=A_1$. Therefore $M/\operatorname{Soc} M$ has infinite uniform dimension. 

Let $R$ be the ring $R=\mathbb C[x,y]$, and let $B$ be the $5$-dimensional $R$-module with shape like a 'W'. That is, basis elements are $a_1,a_2,a_3,b_1,b_2$ and the module structure is given by $$y \cdot a_1=b_1,$$ $$x \cdot a_2=b_1,$$ $$y \cdot a_2=b_2,$$ $$x \cdot a_3=b_2,$$ and all other products of generators and basis elements are zero. Let $A=\mathbb C$ be the trivial $R$-module and consider the parallel morphisms $f,f' \colon A \rightarrow B$ defined by $f(z)=zb_1$ and $f'(z)=zb_2.$ Now ${\mathrm{coker}} \; f \simeq {\mathrm{coker}} \; f'$ as $R$-modules, but $f$ and $f'$ are non-isomorphic in $\mathrm{Mor}(\mathrm{Mod} \; R)$. This gives an example in the derived category of $\mathrm{Mod} \; R$. 

This cannot be right if $R$ is injective as an $R$-module and the global dimension is non-zero but finite. Let for instance $R$ be the ring $R = \prod_{i=1}^\infty \mathbb{C}$ and assume the Continuum Hypothesis so that ${\rm gldim}(R)=2$. Then by a theorem of Auslander there is a cyclic module $N$ such that ${\rm pd}(N)=2$. Take a free resolution of $N$ and obtain a free module $F$ such that ${\rm Ext}^2(N,F) \neq 0$. But ${\rm Ext}^2(N,R)=0$ since $R$ is injective. 

This is true whenever condition (Fg) from the theory of support varieties holds. A finite dimensional algebra $A$ with Jacobson radical $J$ is said to satisfy condition (Fg) if the Hochschild cohomology ring ${\rm{HH}}^{\ast}(A)$ of $A$ is Noetherian and ${\rm{Ext}}^{\ast}_A(A/J,A/J)$ is finitely generated as an ${\rm{HH}}^{\ast}(A)$-module. The ring ${\rm{HH}}^{\ast}(A)$ acts on ${\rm{Ext}}^{\ast}_A(M,N)$ through the graded center of ${\rm{Ext}}^{\ast}_A(M,M)$ as explained in section 3 of [Solberg, Support varieties for modules and complexes]. Condition (Fg) implies that ${\rm{Ext}}^{\ast}_A(M,N)$ is finitely generated as an ${\rm{HH}}^{\ast}(A)$-module [Propositions 5.5 and 5.7 of that paper]. This in turn implies that ${\rm{Ext}}^{\ast}_A (M,N)$ is finitely generated as an ${\rm{Ext}}^{\ast}_A(M,M)$-module. See the introduction to arXiv:1003.2867 for classes of algebras that satisfy condition (Fg). In particular (Fg) holds when $A$ is a representation finite self-injective algebra over an algebraically closed field. 

Proof: Suppose $T=Be \oplus Y$ is a tilting $B$-module and $Y$ has an indecomposable direct summand $Y'$ with $(BeB)Y' \neq 0$. Let $f \colon P(Y') \to Y'$ be the projective cover. Then $P(Y')$ is an indecomposable direct summand of $Be$, so $\ker f$ is not projective. Hence the projective dimension of $Y'$ is at least $2$. Contradiction. Conclusion: The number of tilting $B$-modules is equal to the number of tilting $A_l$-modules. 

Just to establish some more reference points: In the book ], the socle of a module is defined, but no special notation is used. In the paper , the notation $S(M)$ is used. In the book , the notation ${Soc} \; M$ is used. 

"mod" has to mean the category of finitely generated graded modules, if not, there is no such equivalence. Up to graded shifts (and isomorphism), the category $A-\mathsf{mod}$ in your example only has two indecomposable objects: the trivial module $\mathbb C$ and the lenght two projective-injective module $A$. Let $I$ denote the indecomposable graded injective module cogenerated in degree $0$, so $I=A \langle -1 \rangle$. Theorem 2.12.5 contains all you need in order to understand the functor $F$ in this example. According to Theorem 2.12.5, $$F(\mathbb C \langle-n\rangle )=A^! [n] \langle n \rangle$$ and $$F(I \langle-n\rangle)=\mathbb C [n] \langle n \rangle .$$ In conclusion, the indecomposable objects in the essential image $F(A-\mathsf{mod})$ are $\{ A^! [n] \langle n \rangle \}_{n \in \mathbb Z}$ and $\{\mathbb C [n] \langle n \rangle \}_{n \in \mathbb Z}$. A typical exact sequence $$0 \rightarrow \mathbb C \rightarrow I \rightarrow \mathbb C\langle-1\rangle \rightarrow 0$$ in $A-\mathsf{mod}$ is sent by $F$ to the exact sequence $$0 \rightarrow A^! \rightarrow \mathbb C \rightarrow A^! [1] \langle 1 \rangle \rightarrow 0$$ in $F(A-\mathsf{mod})$.
