Local features Mountains Apart from the global circulation of the atmosphere, there is lot of local features, that can create deserts, for example. In my opinion, one should roughly imagine where the clouds are coming from and where do they go. Clouds appear above oceans, the warmer the region, the more clouds appear. Then, they follow the prevailing direction of winds. (See the discussion above.) If there are high mountains between, there will be a lot of precipitation on the side from where the clouds go, and dry region, possibly desert, after that. Continents The water slowly rains away above the land. Hundreds or thousands of kilometers in the middle of large continent, there will be a dry region with big temperature differences between summer and winter. (Or even within one day for slowly rotating planets.) This might go to extremes for large continents. 

To some extent, you can create your own star system also in Space Engine. It has beatiful graphics, it allows you to make videos or photos from the surfaces of planets in various angles, but it is not so interactive as the Universe Sandbox. This basically means that you have to input the parameters in text format and you cannot just add them by clicking. The Space Engine is free. I have also heard that AstroSynthesis is quite good, but I have no experience with it myself. 

You're asking about "unknown unknowns" (threats they wouldn't be aware of until months after building.) Game Theory tells us that in a condition of uncertainty, always assume the worst, and make decisions accordingly. In this conception, building the colony in a bunker, deep in the planet's surface is probably the safest course of action. But there is also the concept of acceptable risk, and the idea that you don't necessarily make decisions based on highly improbably circumstances. What is the net benefit vs. the risk of building on the surface? Really, it's going to depend on all of the known factors comprising the rest of your world/scenario. 

Liminality is perhaps the most important aspect of mythology, as nearly all cycles are concerned with binaries such as life/death, winter/summer, etc. (i.e. Pagan religions tend to be focused on the cycles of generation.) The concept is doubly resonant here in that important definitions of "liman" are maritime and fluvial. 

We see it in the caduceus of Hermes and the thyrsus of Dionysos, both gods with tangible magical powers. The symbol pre-dates Ancient Greece--Thoth, commonly associated with magic, is depicted with a staff. The symbol was formalized in the hermetic tradition, in the suite of clubs. In Tarot decks, clubs are known as "staves", "rods" or "wands", and their domain is fire. Fire fundamentally represents power in the form of energy. Note that in the Rider-Waite Ace of Wands, the staff depicted is the thyrsus: Even Zeus' lightening bolts are a form of staff, and constitute something of an ultimate weapon, as demonstrated by Zeus' vanquishing of Typhon, and it's important to note that the symbol was also associated with temporal power and authority, which Wizards often wield. This form of the staff is commonly known as a sceptre. CONCLUSION: As to why the staff increases power, it almost certainly has to do with the phallic nature of the symbol/object. Hermes was quite literally a phallic god in that his earliest representations are "hermas", simple columns of rock or wood (pun intended;) The honey-dripping thyrsus is overtly phallic. Typically feminine power is receptive (the suit of cups/grail) where male generative power is active. Thus the staff is a symbol of the active exercise of power, spiritual and temporal. 

There is quite simple formula that will give you the tidal-locking half-time $$T = 6 × 10^{12}\, \frac{a^6 R \mu}{ (M_s M_p^2)}\; \mathrm{years}$$ 

Alternative viewpoint: Maybe we shouldn't assert that behavior of aliens is in all situations so different from ours. Aliens, if they are evolved creatures like us, probably evolved their psychology to best serve evolution strategy they need. We can notice that dogs, for example, behave not so differently from us. Probably because they are pack animals, same as we are. Cats on the other hand, are solitary predators, and they may be quite inscrutable - their evolutionary strategy is different than ours. There is interesting (although very speculative) hypothesis how our psychology and morality is shaped by our evolutionary origins. It is called Moral Foundations Theory (more here and here). It assumes that morality of almost any society of humans contains elements of five pillars, which have quite clear evolutionary origin: 

There is very detailed discussion about this issue in the field of Astrobiology. There is many constrains for "reasonable" life. I will try to go through most of them in short points. Let me use following approximate definition of life in my answer: 

I'd consider carefully the suggestions presented by @LudovicZenohateLagouardette and look for ways to turn them into metaphors for gods. The ideas there are very consistent with early mythology in general. I'd look at places like Egypt and the Ancient Near East, which have more fundamental representations than later, Classical mythology. (If you want more info, I can elaborate. For instance, The concept of unfathomable trenches brings to mind Ginnungagap, which can be embodied in the spirit of the Greek Χάος) In terms of direct suggestions, off the top of my head: 

I highly recommend the book The Qabalistic Tarot: A Textbook of Mystical Philosophy. It is scholarly, extremely well researched, and contains extensive footnotes and citations. You may also find Israel Regardie's work useful, particularly The Tree of Life: A Study in Magic. [Note: there is also a revised, illustrated edition available]. And of course, for an understanding of magic in general, Frazier's The Golden Bough is essential. (Take a look at the chapter on Sympathetic Magic, which is a very good primer.) Finally, Alan Moore's Promethea can be understood as a thesis on magic in general, and the Tarot in particular. Plus, the artwork is astounding! 

Imagine there is a country in which there are all important natural resources (oil, gas, metal ores, wood, etc.) in their natural form and which lies in a temperate climate region. There may be some portion of a sea. The country is completely isolated from the rest of the world - nothing (except for air, precipitation, etc.) can get in or out. What is the minimum population and size of the country to sustain a developed industrial society? (All the technology used there has to be produced somewhere in the country eventually.) The technology level is current. (Year 2014, realistic technologies that can be mass-produced with reasonable cost.) By other words: What is the minimum amount of people and land to produce self-sustained agriculture and all relevant factories that are necessary for complete self sufficiency in industry from mining all ores to producing the final devices? Consider that people need to be educated and not all are geniuses that can be educated to the cutting-edge technology expert levels. EDIT: You can assume the technology is initially present, it does not have to be invented, but next generation must be able to learn it and understand it. (For example people have a very good library, or computer database, as long as the computers are running.) 

This could be used in a circular manner, swinging the axe-blade at the opponent at a level designed to forestall ducking or jumping to avoid the path of the blade. 

Related to sphennings answer, what you'd really want with this idea is a broad, narrow, double-edged axe blade. 

I strongly urge you to look at Conway's Game of Life, particularly at how it demonstrates that complex structures can arise from very simple rules. In an infinite Game of Life, the hypothesis holds that intelligence and superintelligence would develop. I think there's an opportunity to unify the two concepts you are pondering in your world. 

This would be some sort of simple, cellular matrix, the size of the entire ocean, using natural processes such as photosynthesis and other chemical reactions, even underwater volcanic vents, for power. This is essentially a plant scale cellular automata. This is also known as the Gaia Hypothesis. 

In this case, the heavier blade is a bonus because it can have sufficient momentum to incapacitate the opponent. This is similar to the type of advantage long blades such as the Claymore confer--the arc of the swing requires defenders to stay out of it's path and forestall closing quickly, even when the great sword wielder is temporarily oriented in a different direction, although it probably works best in conjunction with plate armor. 

Please note that the prefactor $6 × 10^{10}$ currently used on Wikipedia is very probably wrong, so I provided a more realistic one. (See the discussion.) The tidal locking is approximately exponential process, so it is very quick at the beginning and gradually slows down. Typical situation is, that planets in the habitable zone are tidally locked for red dwarf stars. Moons are very often tidally locked, unless they are very far from their planet. 

The theory of Late Heavy Bombardment says that approximately 4 billions of years ago, something disturbed the orbits of asteroids in the Kuiper belt, which caused extremely heavy bombardment of Earth by asteroids. This probably brought many heavy elements to Earth's surface. The heavy elements that were here previously, during the Earth's formation, sank to the core when the Earth was liquid which made them out of reach. In other words, if there was no Late Heavy Bombardment, the surface of Earth might have been almost without elements much heavier than silicon. (Iron, gold, silver, platinum and others would be extremely rare.) My question: If humans developed the same way they did, what kind of technology would be achievable almost without elements much heavier than silicon? 

It's actually not an issue because "history is written by the victors", who often use their dominance to codify the evil of the vanquished. The vanquished may have been evil, but evil is a relative concept based on social mores, (despite what deolators would assert), and so, even engaging in acts that would be considered evil, it's a safe bet that most of the actors did not consider such actions evil. But the depiction of the vanquished as evil is in no way universal. Certainly this was not the case in the Iliad of Homer. In the Iliad, the Trojans are not presented as evil. Conversely, they are depicted as noble adversaries, with the subversive element that their dignity is greater than that of the Greeks, certainly Agamemnon, Menelaus and Odysseus. It's not insignificant that the epic ends with the line "And thus was the funeral of Hector, breaker of horses." Hector unquestionably possessed the greatest dignity of all of the heroes of the epic, Greek or Trojan. He neither instigated the war nor desired it, but must fight in it regardless. He is blameless and esteemed, and makes the greatest sacrifice for his country. I'd say that books where the bad guys are evil is a type of shorthand, a technique that allows the author not to have fully explicate their point of view in simplistic narrative. Another way to contextualize this is per the advice of skilled actors in portraying villains, and may be condensed into: 

Gravitational force field on the torus surface. Inner side of the torus is right, outer side is left. It may be counter-intuitive that the potential energy is equal on the whole surface, but the gravity strength is changing. Equal potential energy only means that the force always points into the surface and walking around does not require work. But the gravitational force will change. It is strongest inside the torus where the centrifugal and the gravitational forces add up. It is weakest at the outside, where they subtract. Results The most important result is that if you precisely balance the gravitational and the centrifugal force, the toroidal planet can indeed be stable. The planet must rotate very quickly, otherwise it will collapse to a sphere. In this case once in 2.65 hours. Other parameters valid for my planet are listed below, but there can probably be many others that work as well. 

Representation of the torus by massive points. The torus is in fact elliptical. Then, I included a centrifugal force potential and I was looking for surface of constant potential, which would enclose the massive points and which could represent the surface of the planet. At the surface, I calculated the force field. 

The purpose is not to get hydrogen or helium, but heavy metals, which are only produced in stellar cores. This was a feature of the astonishing Quantum Thief Trilogy written by real-life mathematical physicist Hannu Rajaneimi. In Rajaneimi's book, it required only a the technology of a post-singularity civilization, still restricted to our own solar system. (The idea is that the mechanics are well within the bounds of a civilization approaching Type II on the Kardashev scale. 

You may want to look a the New Sun trilogy by Gene Wolfe. It's an extraordinary feat of worldbuilding (Wolfe is regarded as the "scifi writers' writer", a term of profound respect for his vision and execution.) In this series, the world is so old, the ages of history are marked by the exhaustion of different resources, such as iron. 

(See the Free Will Theorem.) Computing is based on decisions, and decisions are an expression of "will". Since you use a religious context, tying it into this issue of central importance in modern religions would greatly strengthen the work. 

Imagine a world in which technology we would probably call "technological singularity" is possible and already happened on few places of the galaxy. By the singularity I do not mean that anything is possible, but rather that original biological species transform themselves into extremely highly intelligent computer programs with big amount of control of their environment, and they completely transcend their biological nature. The post-singularity societies might rebuild planets to giant computers or even create Matrioshka brains, since the main scarce resources are computer time and memory. It would be relatively easy for such civilization to send spaceships that would transform all solar systems in our galaxy into computers and utilize them. It would be even easy for a small splinter faction inside such civilization, unless the "official forces" actively prevent it. The motivation is simply a lot of resources and freedom to gain. My question is: Are there plausible reasons that would prevent it and keep the civilizations bound to their home star systems? If there is such, the reason should be strong and valid for all such civilizations. If nine out of ten civilizations decide not to spread, and one does, the galaxy will still be transformed.
