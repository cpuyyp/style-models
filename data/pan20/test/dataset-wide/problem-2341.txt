The easiest way to carry a backpack is on your back. If you're looking for a bag for cycling, then you either need to invest in some pannier bags, or some bikepacks: 

I've encountered moose on several occasions. The first was when I was a boy while walking through the woods on the way to school, I was on the trail through the woods that connected to the upper part of town when I came up behind a big moose. I stopped, backed away slow, then as nonchalantly as possible turned my back to the moose and walked away. When I got around the corner, I darted up the hill through the thickest trees I could find and took a really wide berth around where the moose was. The second time I encountered a moose, also while a boy, it charged me and my friends. We didn't even know it was there until we heard it huffing and ploughing through the snow behind us (it had a calf, and we unwittingly disturbed it with our big inner tube we were rolling down the hill). The flight response was strong with us that day. I don't mess around with moose. In fact, I fear them somewhat more than bears for one primary reason: they are dumb. The last thing you want is a crazy swamp donkey losing it's little mind and four-hoof river dancing all over your face. Moose won't maim you and kill you like a bear will, they'll stomp you into the ground and leave you horrifically beaten and broken. No one in my neck of the woods will approach a wild animal, especially not one that stands 7 feet at the shoulder and weighs as much as a car, that's something naive tourists do. The smart thing for your husband to do would have been to back away and observe from a distance if you wanted to take a look. The last time I had an uncomfortable encounter with a moose, I was urging my friend with the gun to fire a warning shot into its head... What your husband did was dumb. If you want more reasons for why it was dumb, spend some time on YouTube watching videos of aggressive moose. 

Multiple Mattress Systems The best sleep system is a combination of both a foam pad and an air-mattress. The foam pad protects the air-mattress from the ground, moisture, and provides extra insulation, as well as a bit of firmness when you roll onto your side and you shoulder or hip fully compress your air mattress. It stops your air mattress from sliding around on your tent floor, and gives you something to kneel on when packing everything else up inside your tent. The con to this system is of course extra weight, it's up to each individual to determine what they need to sleep comfortably, different styles of mattress and different combinations of sleep systems will suit different people. 

Pulkas are super nice, because you need to carry more with you in the winter than in the summer, like extra clothing layers, heavier boots, a warmer sleeping system, snowshoes/skis, hot water bottle... And you can easily carry twice as much as normal with a pulka. Pulkas are also preferable in deep snow, because having a bag on your back makes you heavier and sink more with each step. My next favourite part about winter camp is that you don't need to bring a tent if you know how to make a good snow shelter, and my third favourite thing is doing dishes, because you can just scour out the inside of your bowl or mug with snow and it gets it sparkly clean in seconds, it's super convenient. As long as you know how to survive in the cold (assuming you know how to do being from Michigan), then you should be ok, but perhaps spend a night with your buddies in your back yard before embarking out into the wilderness, you can get your sleep system worked out with a warm place you can retreat to if needed. 

I only do this on the top hooks myself. It helps lock off the laces and prevents them from popping off the hooks. If you leave it the other way around (bottom to top), and don't tie your boots tight enough, then your laces can come off the top hooks, or the knot could roll over the top of the tongue of your boot, especially if you're doing a lot of high-stepping or crouching and flexing your ankle a lot. I've had it happen to me multiple times, which is why I switched to tying it top-down. This may be more of an issue for skinny ankles, I had it happen to me a lot when I was a kid and had twigs for legs, but even now when I tie my boots, if I don't go top-down then I don't feel like I'm as secure as the other way around. Tying all your hooks top-down obviously puts more friction in the system, which would enable you to tie you boots a lot more snug, or leave them a little loose around the ankles without having to worry about the arches coming as loose. 

They eat them. It's true, egg shells are edible, and birds will eat them. Mommy robin probably snacked on the shells while she was sitting on her babies keeping them warm. After laying their eggs, birds are rather depleted of calcium, and eagerly eat the shells up to replenish those minerals. Eggs shells are actually a recommended food for bird feeders. Bird watchers will lightly bake chicken egg shells to make them brittle, then put them in their bird feeder. 

Their hand should never be off of the brake strand. In the set up in the BD video the rope would auto lock as soon as they let go of the release sling. They just say, "use a back up," they show a munter back up, but don't specify that's what you have to use, you can back up however you want. They're using a munter most likely because they're quick and easy to tie. An autoblock would take time to set up, but you could throw a munter into your belay loop in just a second, one handed, and lower straight away. Method 3 This is a brilliant set up, it's bomber and it's redundant, but maybe a little too redundant for top-roping a single pitch. You'd still have to take the time to redirect the belay end of the rope through the top shelf of the anchor and tie your autoblock. 

You don't need to wax the bases, but you will glide faster if you do, but I'd probably just use a glide wax, I'm not sure how well hot wax would stick. 

The single most important consideration for your parents is going to be their comfort. For starters they must have something comfortable to sleep on or they're going to spend every day achy and tired, wishing they were sleeping in their own beds. The older you get, the more precious sleep is. If they can't get a good, comfortable night's sleep, then they aren't going to enjoy camping at all. I know a number of old-time campers who have given up tenting in favour of their memory foam posture-pedic beds for the sakes of their old back bones. I would recommend going all out and getting them a luxurious air mattress, something like the Coleman Durarest Queen double high:
