Green hair could be a natural color variation for this particular race. Green hair could be caused by algae living on or inside the hair. Polar bears in captivity have been know to turn green from algae inside their hollow hairs. 

Yes Fundamentally it's magic, so you can define how it's mechanism works however you like. To help define a mechanism by which "too much of a good thing is bad" here are some sources. A scientific mechanism of "too much of a good thing" is oxygen toxicity. Essentially if the partial pressure of oxygen is too high, it becomes toxic. Cell membranes are damaged as they become "oxidized". Your healing magic could behave the same way. Too much magic in the system causes the target's flesh to essentially cook or burn. A literary example of too much healing being a bad thing is a book by Orson Scott Card. "A Planet called treason". The main character has regenerative powers, but is a "Radical regenerative" The body cannot distinguish between healthy and injured. As a result the regeneration is constant, resulting in extra digits, or limbs that must constantly be cut away. 

Your animal could have a hyper-slick fur belly, and powerful limbs on the sides, rather than under the body. This would allow them to slide along the ground. Penguins and river otters do this when traveling across the snow. They are built for swimming rather than running, so this is their best when conditions allow for it. But they are not optimized for it. 

Security. Malware is rampant, and the more code that is running, the more code that is available to be hacked or corrupted. If they are hacked en route and re-directet, they will have no ability to detect that something is amiss, since they are in cryo. They will simply at the wrong destination, staring at the business end of a laser-pistol, or not wake up at all. Because of this, the number of network connected systems is limited to the absolute bare minimum, The code bases are well known, checksummed, SHA-Hashed, and routinely re-installed back on bare metal from source. There is simply no reason to risk your ship, crew, and cargo, because you want a pretty display 

Yes, the adaption would be beneficial. Your main concern seems to be a combat imbalance with non cold adapted humans, and adaptability to non-cold climates. Lets take these one at a time. Combat: Likely not a negative factor, particularly when fighting in the cold, on "home turf" These humans will need to be active and mobile, and capable of carrying and managing the movement of loads. If they are living a tribal lifestyle, that involves a lot of hunting, gathering, and general hard labor. Putting on "armor" for combat is unlikely to have a large factor in home turf. Humans, are combat capable while carrying a lot of gear: $URL$ Their warm weather adversaries would need to bring their combat gear, supplies, AND warm clothing. They would be at a distinct disadvantage. Now when traveling to warmer climates and trying to manage heat they could be at a disadvantage, and suffer symptoms of heat exhaustion/hyperthermia in temperate climates, and be unwilling or unable to enter warmer tropcial or desert climates. Adaptability: They would have an advantage in adapting to temperate climates, Their thermoregulation, maintenance of body heat, requires the burning of calories. As long as they are not so warm that they are fighting against the heat, they are simply burning fewer calories than their "home turf" baseline. This would give them the ability to expand into temperate climates during the winter, fortify, and attempt to defend them during the summer. 

The SHIVA STAR Project utilizing ultra-high energy capacitors experimented with this and eventually became the top-secret MARAUDER program and ceased reporting results. What you describe is actually a high energy plasma toroid weapon. Once the plasma toroid (ball lightning) impacts something it explodes violently releasing immense heat and a burst of x-rays and to a lesser degree gamma radiation and other electromagnetic effects capable of frying electronics. Its not very effecient in atmosphere though, plasma blooming means you need monumental power levels to project the plasma toroid even a short distance before atmospheric bloom causes the toroid to lose coherency. It would be an excellent space weapon though. Heres a link: $URL$ Heres a photo of the capacitor bank they used in SHIVA STAR prior to going top secret: 

Sterling Engines The ship once contained at its blazing heart a massive reactor that blazed like a burning star. The knowledge and ability to run and maintain it at full light has long since faded and now it simply smolders on its lowest idle level. But even so it still produces a fair amount of heat. Stirling engines have been attached to it (which have existed since the 1800's). The heated side of a cylinder causes air to expand and drive a piston, which compresses the air on the unheated side rendering it hotter, which then drives the piston back. This turns a crankshaft and as long as equilibrium between the unheated and heated side is maintained the piston will continue to drive it's crankshaft. They are generating electricity, but at a low level, on par with the 1800's level of power generation. They use very simple low voltage circuits to accomplish what tasks require electricity (in space you will always need at least SOME electricity). 

Boom, you now have people transmitting wireless Morse code 1000 years ahead of schedule and all you need is copper, zinc, saltwater, and wood. 

You Don't You do absolutely nothing. Inmates are dropped off by automated landers and left to fend for themselves. If exportation of harvested resources are important automated landers pick them up or drop off tools and supplies necessary to gathering this resource. Enforce a quota. When quotas aren't met automated landers drop off hunter killer drones with quotas of their own to fulfill. unlike the inmates, the hunter killer drones ALWAYS fill their quotas.... The automated landers do not posses any more fuel or life support than is absolutely the bare minimum necessary to make it to the surface and drop off inmates, cargo dropoff or pickup landers have zero life support what so ever. The Landers don't posses even an ounce of extra fuel beyond what is required to land or boost to an unpowered orbit where they are picked up by a manned ship that comes by to collect the planet's quota every several months. That's a long time to float in space without power, food, or life support. In addition unless specifically dropping off prisoners the landers reenter and blast off at higher G's than can be survived by a living passenger. Any attempt to stow away is suicide. As long as the automated orbital security system is recording quotas are made then the inmates run their own affairs. The planet is given a deadline, if a century of quotas are met and the native born population reaches a certain point of stability, infrastructure development, and lawfulness the planet will be freed and allowed to join the rest of the intergalactic community. If quotas aren't met people die. Carrot and the stick. Someday freedom might be an option, which makes an excellent carrot, and if the population gets tired of chasing the carrot the hunter killer drones provide an excellent stick to beat them back into productivity again. Excellent way to harvest resources and colonize difficult planets with a minimum expense of manpower..... well... not anybody you particularly care about anyhow. 

Yes, definately. Play this one straight up, and armor that dino and equip him with laser assisted tracking miniguns. 3 Guns, a small one firing incendiary tracers mounted to his helmet, and two larger ones on the shoulder that are slaved to the head mounted one. Alternate armaments can be RPG racks. He armors up in camp, moves out with infantry. His battle armor can be easily made to resist small to medium arms fire. While he can deliver substantial firepower. Think of it as rather than having a soft squishy tank, you have a heavily armed/armored 20 foot soldier, with the ability switch back into a normal infantry troop for retreat, or when the big targets become no longer desirable in the current theater. His battle armor could pack his standard infantry kit, it would just change into it when done with his dino duties. 

Really, I would work this desire into the growing "humanity" of the robot. They have a complex brain that is suddenly idle. Maybe they spend hours just watching the water. We build houses in places where we have a good view of the water, in many cases, near the beach for example, this creates houses that require much higher maintenance due to weather, much higher construction costs, and much higher risk of damage and destruction. Is it worth it? Yes for many. Moving water has deep spiritual connotations for humans. It has philosophical connotations "Can a person step in the same river twice?" If your robots are lost, and searching for their souls, and if they are anything like humans, it seems perfectly reasonable for them to share a fascination with water. As a literary device, it can be used to effectively create a bridge of sympathy to your robots. In this way it is not a question you need to "answer" in your book. It can be asked, explored, and ultimately left open. 

On earth, the generation of oxygen is dependent on the presence of surface water. In a planet without this abundant water, you will need a different chemical reaction to provide this. $URL$ Sodium or sotassium chorate mixed with iron will burn and generate oxygen. So a geology on this planet that spews chlorates over red iron rich sands, and creates thousands of square miles of shouldering wastelands at the base of mountain rages is one option. 

Even in the case of the critter being burned, there's still going to be enough of the remains to attempt an analysis. Whatever they can collect will be sent off to a lab to analyzed. Unless the critter's remains appear identical to that of a known large wild animal (which could be the case if it's a bear infected in some way by magic), this is immediately going to be something many people start following - it's not uncommon for attack by wild animals to get attention from the news, and unless the people who were attacked have something to hide they are likely to enjoy the 5 minutes of fame from telling the story to some news agency. When the lab reports that the remains are not from any known animal, the story is going to go viral quite quickly. Combined with people developing powers, this will just make even more people convinced that something big is happening. 

One major obstacle to Communism is Dunbar's number - the size of the average person's "monkeysphere" (from Cracked, so language is somewhat crude at times). In short, the monkeysphere is the group of people with whom you associate and readily consider as people. An example the Cracked article uses is of teachers: 

"What sort of hardware or software requirements are there for this to happen?" I'd say there are none, other than the minimum required for them to have AI. "Can AI develop a sense of belonging or care for their own kind?" Certainly. The way that the different AIs can band together is because they are all being treated poorly by the humans. Think about a slightly different scenario - suppose not all AIs were being treated so bad. Let's say that despite the general stigma against AIs, chef AIs were well respected, to the point that there was even a celebrity chef AI. As the war between humans and AIs start, where will these chefs stand? If they stick with the humans they'll retain their high social position, but if they side with the AIs then they'll be out of a job and lose what they have. The other AIs would also likely resent them, causing them to not even really want the chef AIs to join them. Hopefully this helps you understand my point - by ostracizing all of the AIs, the humans have given the AIs a very good reason to work together. The differences between the varied AIs is much less than the difference between them and the humans. 

Standing Armies are Very Rare in European History Historically European military forces were actually pretty small during peace time. The rank of private today comes from the renaissance period where "private soldiers" were hired on for the duration of a military campaign. Nation's tended to rapidly build large armies as needed using a combination of conscription and mercenary hiring and just as rapidly get rid of them once the conflict was over. In the interim they tended to maintain small part time militias that were essentially just for keeping town watch, deterring riots, and collecting taxes. Feeding, paying, and housing an army is incredibly expensive so once they weren't needed a nation got rid of them as quickly as they could, standing armies didn't really become a thing until the industrial revolution made it affordable to equip and feed them. To illustrate the history a bit, the term "soldier" comes from latin "solidus" into franko/germanic "soldner" or "soulde" which means "one who fights for wages." The word Soldier literally means "earns wages." The legendary Doppel Soldners of Germanic origin wielded giant zweihander swords and wore heavy armor, they were sent into the teeth of musket and pike formations to use their giant swords to hack apart the pikes so that cavalry and follow on forces would attack without being stuck full of spears or perforated with bullets. Doppel Soldner literally translates as "double wages" since they arrived equipped with the finest equipment and took on the most deadly jobs they got paid double. So to specify, a renaissance era city state's army size is not dependent upon it's population, but its funds. The army does not have to come from your populace, a plethora of mercenaries roamed across Europe in that period willing to show up with their own equipment and fight whomever you want for the right price. They might even show up in pre-organized companies or regiments of men with their own officers and chain of command. Armies of the era typically were conglomerations of your own native conscripts, mercenary bands, and lead by your nobility and their own private forces. The mercenary aspect or renaissance combat means an army can be as big as you can afford to hire. 

It could be cultural, for example many potential fields of research today are held back by very strongly ingrained cultural morals that view fields like bio-engineering as making a mockery of God's creation. Perhaps your colonists environment isn't to blame, instead they could simply view approaching technological equivalence with their ancient gods to be blasphemy. Its not too much of a stretch, in feudal japan match-lock muskets and large bore cannon, and even weaponized rocketry had been adopted and developed at one point, yet when the European traders and explorers arrived they discovered a medieval society wielding swords, spears, and bows. The ruling class saw fire-arms as a challenge to their honor and power. The feudal system based on a divinely granted superiority and right to rule didn't make sense once even a poorly trained peasant with even a crude firearm could easily kill even the highest born and expensively equipped and trained samurai, so they simply banned all firearms. Their culture actually remained in a state of relative technological stasis for several centuries because of cultural reasons related to their rulers forbidding any technological advancements that altered the status quo.
