Cartwright and Kucharski give a generalization of Jackson's inequality for an arbitrary compact connected Lie group. I only need the uniform norm, rank 1 case for the canonical torus, so I state here this special case. Theorem Fix $n \in \mathbb{N}$. Then there is $M_n >0$ s.t. for any $r > 0$ there is $K_r \in C^\infty(T^n, \mathbb{R})$ s.t. its Fourier transform satisfies $\operatorname{supp} \hat{K}_r \subseteq \{\vartheta \in \mathbb{Z}^n \mid \lVert \vartheta \rVert \leq r\}$ and for any $f \in C(T^n, \mathbb{C})$ we have $$\lVert f - K_r * f \rVert_\infty \leq M_n \sup_{d(z,w) \leq \frac{1}{r}} \lvert f(z) - f(w) \rvert$$ 

It seems natural to consider the additional condition on $K$ that $K_x$ depends continuously on $x$ in the sense of the given topology on $X$ and the weak topology on the space $\mathcal{P}(Y)$ of probability measures on $Y$. For example, if $K$ is deterministic (i.e. if for any $x \in X$, $K_x$ is a Dirac measure) this condition means that $K$ defines a continuous mapping from $X$ to $Y$. 

Fix a scheme $S$, a group scheme $G/S$ (let us say smooth, maybe even affine with some finiteness conditions if you like), and suppose I have some other $S$-scheme $P$ with a right $G$-action. We want to investigate the question of whether $P$ is a $G$-torsor (in the fppf topology). If I understand correctly, then since $G$ is smooth it is equivalent for $P$ to be a torsor in the etale topology, which is a priori a relatively strong condition. On the other hand, an a priori weaker statement is that it be a torsor in the fpqc topology. My question is: suppose I can find an fpqc (but not finitely presented) cover $\{S_i \rightarrow S\}$ with $P\times_S S_i \rightarrow S_i$ isomorphic to the trivial $G\times_S S_i$-torsor. Are there circumstances under which I may conclude that $P$ is in fact an fppf torsor? One (perhaps silly) example is if I have $S$ equal to the spectrum of some small field $k$ with an interesting Galois group, and I am able to find some huge complicated transcendental extension $K/k$ over which $P$ becomes a trivial torsor. Under what conditions does this imply the existence of a finite separable extension over which $P$ becomes a trivial torsor? 

Consider $D$ a set and $X$ a linear space of functions $D \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ s.t. for any $f \in X$ and $g: D \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, if $\lvert g \rvert \leq \lvert f \rvert$ then $g \in X$. Such spaces naturally arise as classes of asymptotic behaviors, for example if $D = \mathbb{N}$ and $h: \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, we can take $X := \{f: \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{R} \mid \lvert f \rvert = O(h)\}$. If $D$ has extra structure we can restrict consideration to functions satisfying certain conditions e.g. if $D$ is a topological space we can consider only continuous functions. Is there a name for $X$ like that? 

According to Jackson's inequality, there is $c > 0$ s.t. for any continuous function $f: S^1 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ (where $S^1 := \mathbb{R} / \mathbb{Z}$ is the circle) and integer $n$ there is a trigonometric polynomial $q: S^1 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ of degree $n$ s.t. $$\lVert f - q \rVert_\infty \leq c \, \omega(f,\frac{1}{n})$$ Here $\omega$ is the modulus of continuity: $$\omega(f,\delta):=\sup_{\substack{x \in S^1 \\ h \in [0,\delta]}} \lvert f(x) - f(x + h) \rvert$$ I'm looking for a generalization of this theorem to functions $f: T^d \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ where $T^d := \mathbb{R}^d / \mathbb{Z}^d$ is the canonical $d$-dimensional torus. 

In the theory of automorphic representations one says that G satisfies a "multiplicity one" property if every cuspidal representation occurs with multiplicity one in $L^2(G(F)\backslash G(A))$. One also says that G satisfies "strong multiplicity one" if a cuspidal representation is uniquely determined up to isomorphism by its behaviour at cofinitely many places of F. My question is: does the latter always imply the former (as the name would suggest), and is there a decent reason? This question was prompted while thinking about Jacquet-Langlands, whose proof (via the trace formula) seems to give multiplicity one as a by-product and whose statement also directly implies strong multiplicity one (for inner forms of GL2 using the result for GL2 itself). However, I didn't see any way to deduce multiplicity one directly from the usual statement. I also can't see how strong multiplicity one for classical modular forms should directly imply the q-expansion principle (which I guess is roughly the same as multiplicity one). Apologies if I'm missing something extremely obvious on this dozy Sunday evening. Thanks, Tom. 

The antisymmetry of $\pi$ imposes the following additional condition: Note that $i(X) \hat{\otimes} Y \cong X \otimes Coker \space h_Y$ which follows by observing that $h$ annihilates $i(X) \hat{\otimes} Y$ due to $k[h]$-linearity of $\hat{\otimes}$, applying $Coker \space h$ and using its tensor functor structure We have the short exact sequence $$0 \rightarrow X \xrightarrow{Ker \space h} X[h] \xrightarrow{Coker \space h} X \rightarrow 0$$ We apply $\hat{\otimes} Y[h]$ and use its exactness to get the short exact sequence $$0 \rightarrow X \otimes Y \rightarrow X[h] \hat{\otimes} Y[h] \rightarrow X \otimes Y \rightarrow 0$$ This sequence yields an element $\epsilon(X, Y)$ of $Ext^1(X \otimes Y, X \otimes Y)$ Due to $b$, $\epsilon(X, Y)$ and $\epsilon(Y, X)$ belong to canonically isomorphic spaces. We demand $$\epsilon(X, Y)+\epsilon(Y, X)=0$$ The problem is I need the case in which $\otimes$ is merely right exact. What currently confuses me is that in the bialgebra picture the last sequence is still exact for general $k$ but I can't prove it in the category-theoretic language 

You can always map $(T,h)$ to the trivial Shimura datum and then this into the Siegel one. I assume this isn't what you want however. May I therefore modify the question to ask whether a zero dimensional variety can be embedded in a Siegel variety. I.e. You want to know if all zero dimensional Shimura varieties are of Hodge type. I think this is certainly false and can give two quick reasons. 1) every Hodge type datum has weight defined over $\mathbb{Q}$ and has compact centre modulo the image of this weight. In general neither condition need hold for a zero dimensional Shimura datum. 2) consider the 'cyclotomic' Shimura datum $T=\mathbb{G}_m$ and $h(z) = z\bar{z}$. Any representation of T will induce a hodge structure of even weight but if it admits a Siegel embedding then this must yield a representation giving the weight 1 Hodge structure defining an abelian variety. 

Perhaps this is a bit too 'standard' for MO, but I'm struggling to dig it out of the literature (and maybe other people have had a similar experience), so it feels like a useful thing to ask and I hope people don't mind. 1) Harish-Chandra's theorem classifies all discrete series reps, which are defined to be the things occurring discretely in the spectrum of G. What is the correct definition of a 'limit of discrete series rep' and the corresponding classification result? Is it simply any non-discrete series tempered representation? (And if not, can I say anything intelligent about the other tempered representations?). 2-3) In his Ann Arbor paper, Harris mentions a theorem along the lines of: let G be a real Lie group admitting a Shimura datum. Then all representations contributing to the (appropriate) cohomology of the Shimura variety are 'nondegenerate' limits of discrete series. 2) What does 'nondegenerate' mean, and is the resulting theorem the strongest general result known in this direction? 3) Is any converse known/conjectured? Can we describe all cohomological representations at least for classical groups? (Where I guess it would be good to have answers interpreting 'cohomological' in both possible ways: coefficients in a local system or in coherent cohomology). If clear references exist that treat things in full generality (not just GL2 or GLn) that would be helpful to know. Thanks, Tom. 

You may consult with Duan Haibao's papers on arxiv. Also, I have a Maple realization of my own, available at $URL$ Unfortunately, there is no documentation, and the coding style is ugly, but examples may help. 

It is useful in the category theory, in particular, in its applications to algebraic geometry. "Small" categories (whose objects form a set) are much nicer than "large categories" (whose objects mere form a "class", whatever it means). In algebraic geometry one wants to consider categories like Sets, Schemes and so on as small --- and technically it is done using Grothendieck's "Axiom of universe", which is equivalent to existence of strongly inacessible cardinals large than a given cardinal, see $URL$ 

For $n=3$ you have $Pfister_3\simeq H^1(*,G_2)$. For greater $n$, you may use notion of cohomological invariants (like in Skip Garibaldi's lectures in Lens) to prove that any $H^1(F,G)$ have a nontrivial cohomological invariant of degree $\le 3$ (namely Tits algebras or the Rost invariant), while for $Pfister_n$ it is possible to have only invariants of degrees at least $n$. 

Suppose I have a smooth non-proper algebraic variety $X/\mathbb{C}$. A vector bundle with flat connection (``differential equation'') on $X$ extends, as was noted by Grothendieck, to a coherent crystal on the infinitesimal site of $X$, realising an equivalence between these two types of object. Deligne's comparison of differential equations on $X$ and $X^{an}$ leads one to restrict one's attention to the subcategory of differential equations on $X$ with regular singularities along the boundary divisor of a good compactification of $X$. My question: is there a clean way to describe this category as a subcategory of the category of crystals on $Inf(X)$? My guess (fear?) is the answer might have something to do with log-geometry, but I know very little about such things so would also appreciate a good reference suggestion if indeed it is the required tool. 

Yes. For elementary reasons. Suppose it weren't dense. Then there would be some little interval not hit, of some positive length say $1/N$. But this cannot happen. Divide the circle into N little equal intervals and consider $0,r,2r,...,Nr$. By pigeonhole some two of them lie in the same interval, say $ar,br$ (and these elements are distinct since $r$ is not rational). Then modulo $\mathbb{Z}$, $-1/N < (a-b)r < 1/N$, and so some multiple of this will lie in the interval we supposed contained no element. 

Given an algebraically closed field $k$ and a finitely generated commutative $k$-algebra $A$, all simple modules over $A$ are 1-dimensional 

Let $(\Omega,\mathcal{F},P)$ be a probability space, $\{\mathcal{F}_n \subseteq \mathcal{F}\}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ an increasing filtration, $S$ a finite set and $X: \Omega \rightarrow S$ a random variable. Denote $\mathcal{P}(\Omega)$ the space of probability measures on $(\Omega, \mathcal{F})$ and assume that $\{Q_n: \Omega \rightarrow \mathcal{P}(\Omega)\}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ are regular conditional probabilities corresponding to $\mathcal{F}_n$. That is, for any $A \in \mathcal{F}$, $Q_n(\omega)(A)$ is an $\mathcal{F}_n$-measurable function of $\omega \in \Omega$ and for any $B \in \mathcal{F}_n$ $$\int_B Q_n(\omega)(A) P(d\omega) = P(A \cap B)$$ For each $n \in \mathbb{N}$, define the information gain $I_n: \Omega \rightarrow \mathbb{R} \sqcup \{+\infty\}$ by $$I_n(\omega):= D_{KL}(X_* Q_{n+1}(\omega) \mid\mid X_* Q_{n}(\omega))$$ Here, $X_*$ denotes push-forward by $X$, i.e. $X_* Q_{n}(\omega)$ is the probability measure on $S$ s.t. for any $A \subseteq S$ $$X_* Q_{n}(\omega)(A) := Q_n(\omega)(X^{-1}(A))$$ $D_{KL}$ is the Kullback–Leibler divergence, i.e. given probability measures $\mu,\nu$ on $S$, regarded as functions from $S$ to $[0,1]$: $$D_{KL}(\mu \mid\mid \nu) := \sum_{s \in S} \mu(s) \ln{\frac{\mu(s)}{\nu(s)}}$$ 

Without the restriction on the lie algebra, certainly. There are interesting examples of families of abelian varieties with (generically) no extra endomorphisms but whose generic Mumford-Tate group is not the whole of $GSp_{2g}$. I believe the first example, a family of fourfolds (the smallest dimension in which such a phenomenon arises) was given at the end of a short paper of Mumford "A note on Shimura's paper "Discontinuous groups and abelian varieties." $URL$ The idea is to take a division algebra $D$ over a cubic totally real field $F$ whose corestriction along $F/\mathbb{Q}$ is split, giving a natural map $Nm: D^* \rightarrow GL_8$. If $D$ ramifies at two of the three places at infinity, one shows that this map has symplectic image and can use the image to define a Hodge type Shimura datum. However, the representation is also absolutely irreducible which implies the underlying Hodge structure (hence abelian variety) attached to a general point in the family doesn't admit any extra endomorphisms. However here I think the group is a $\mathbb{Q}$-form of $SO(4) \times SL(2)$, which maybe isn't what you are looking for (though I suppose its Lie algebra is of type $C_1=A_1$). [P.S. to abz: unless I'm mistaken, $PGL_2$ only gives a Shimura variety of abelian type.] 

Fix a ground commutative ring $k$. A coPoisson-bialgebra is a bialgebra $H$ equipped with a linear mapping $\pi:H \rightarrow H \otimes_k H$ s.t. 

The Lebesgue differentiation theorem says that for certain metric spaces $X$ (see below), any Borel measure $\mu$ that is finite on bounded sets and any $f: X \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ locally $\mu$-integrable, there is $A \subseteq X$ s.t. $\mu(X \setminus A)=0$ and $$\forall x \in A: \lim_{r \rightarrow 0} \frac{1}{\mu(B_r(x))} \int_{B_r(x)} f(y) \mu(dy) = f(x)$$ Here, $B_r(x)$ is the ball of radius $r$ with center $x$. This holds for $X$ a Riemannian manifold or $X$ a locally compact separable ultrametric space. I'm interested to understand how it fails on somewhat more general spaces. In particular: 

Are the following definitions known? Consider H a Hilbert space. A "quantum topology" on H is a set Sigma of closed subspaces satisfying the following conditions: (a) {0} and H lie in Sigma (b) If {V_alpha} is a subset of Sigma then the closure of the sum of the V_alpha lies in Sigma (c) If V, W lie in Sigma then their intersection lies in Sigma Given a quantum topology, we introduce the notion of s a "quantum sheaf of operators" s corresponds to every V in Sigma s(V), a C*-algebra of bounded operators on V. We demand the following conditions on s: (i) If W lies in V, A lies in s(V) and leaves W invariant, then the restriction of A to W lies in s(W) (ii) Suppose {W_alpha} is a subset of Sigma and V is the closure of their sum. Suppose A is a bounded operator on V which leaves every W_alpha invariant. Suppose further that the restriction of A to W_alpha lies in s(W_alpha) for every alpha. Then A lies in s(V) (iii) Suppose {W_alpha} is a subset of Sigma and V is the closure of their sum. Consider C the subalgerba of s(V) consisting of operators of the form defined by condition (ii). Then the commutant of C lies within C.
