Many Slavonic languages have complex declension of numerals, both cardinal and ordinal ones. For example, Ukrainian: 

There are many studies on calligraphy, and in some cultures (Chinese, Indic, Arabic) it became a really significant part of culture. However, there are not only examples of good handwriting. Often we see examples of bad handwritten script. There are even anecdotes of "doctor's handwriting" that can't be easily deciphered (no offense). 

Maybe a good example is Thai. As many languages, it has an effect of epenthesis, an insertion of a vowel. Usually, it is : ขนม (dessert) - note that no vowels are written, but the 2nd one is phonetically much longer; But it can be : บริการ (service) See this article, sections III.b and IV.a 

One can also use ชาย or สาว suffix to clarify brother vs. sister, e.g., น้องชาย = "younger brother" There are four distinct words for uncle/aunt: 

The answer is, because inflections deliver valuable information, otherwise unavailable. Before we get to a more detailed answer, let me emphasize an important one of the potential implications of Chomskyan linguistics, suggesting that all human languages are equally complex. This means, in particular, that a language with a simpler morphology (like Chinese, comparing to English) would more likely to have a more complicated and non-straightforward syntax. Let's take an example: requires two words, while it's English counterpart is a single word, . Note, no inflections yet. In Ukrainian, the same adjective is declined in agreement with the object. If you take a single word, , even with no object, this provides with information about plural noun and Instrumental case. You can think of an analogy that a single adjective delivers a syntax pattern: or, in Chinese, (where is a noun). (Obviously, applies to animate nouns only). Yet another aspect. It is widely agreed (*1) that The Indo-European proto-language in its earliest stage consisted entirely of monosyllabic words (don't confuse with PIE). If that is true, an obvious conclusion would be that all kinds of agglutination — including noun/adjective declension and verb conjugation — have been derived from formerly-separate words, just like Chinese , , (as in ), and many others are. 

First, I looked into dictionaries of Slavic languages. Many, including Vasmer's Dictionary of Russian Language, refer Ancient Greek , but no further references leading to PIE/Sanskrit. Then I looked into Leiden Indo-European Etymological Dictionary and found that 

And yes, if the loanword does not apparently belong to any of the groups above, it is often considered by its category or keyword. Finally, if that was too boring, I have good news: there are lots of exceptions. :) 

At step (3), the root consonant shifts: → ; an impossible thing for isolating languages; At step (6), the inflection particle inflects itself: "-ий-" (SNG.NOM) → "-их-" (PL.GEN) 

This is a theoretical question, so I would take my liberty to answer it in simple terms, too. Nearly all sentences in all languages are about things, their (inter-)actions, and attributes (for both "things" and "actions"). This does not automatically guarantee that within an arbitrary language you will have discrete parts of speech serving the same purpose, but it would definitely suggest that there will be some classes of words that serve these three fundamental purposes. Hence, 

Trouble one: Unicode versions prior to 4.0 treat as a formatting (thus, valid) character, but trying to use the variable leads you to an error because there is no such variable! There's only , but you can't see it. Trouble two: Unicode 4.0 treats as a zero-width space. This means that you're trying to declare a variable with space in its name () which makes your code unable to compile. But again, due to invisibility you simply don't know what's wrong. The code visually looks perfectly valid. 

All above applies per syllable, of course. If the word is polysyllabic, the same rules apply that govern polysyllabic words of Thai language (see Enepenthetic ‘Leading Consonant’ Clusters). (1) In Thai language, syllable's tone is defined by its initial consonant, unless overridden by an explicit tone mark. Each consonant belongs to one of three consonant classes. Each consonant class is associated with a default tone, governed by live/dead syllable or long/short vowel. 

Low language by high-level speakers Usually it is prohibited to use such words for speakers of a high social class, so they use indirect speech to indicate (but not reproduce) vulgar words. 

(in square brackets I put morphemes that do not exist in the final word) While steps (2), (4), and (5) can be directly understood in terms "morpheme → morphologic change", several steps can't be translated that easy. Look what happens here: 

In traditional Principles and Parameters Framework 1, noun phrases (NP) are considered the topmost lexical head. This approach had some disadvantages regarding determiners and how they work with, for example, inflections. Compare: 

Almost, but not absolutely. I'm aware about at least one counter-example: In Thai language, question sentence is formed by using question particle, ไหม (colloquially, มั้ย with the same pronunciation). Just like English form, "…, is it not?" 

Yes, you are correct. This is the way how vowel morphed in Modern Russian comparing to Proto-Slavic: 

Sometimes, people use constructs like คุณลุง "mister uncle". The same applies if you are talking to an official (e.g., a police officer). It is polite to call them "Mr. Name" or "Mr. officer", not "brother". You can also use แม่ "mother" or พ่อ "father" to show some warmness if your friendship lasts longer. 

It seems there are two questions here: central unrounded vs. reduced ones. Vowel reduction usually co-occurs with centralization and loss of roundness. It make sense because when spoken in a natural speed, there's no time to articulate it properly. In Russian, unstressed vowels may reduce significantly, but it applies to any vowel, not only : молоко (milk) невозможно (impossible) жалеть (to be sorry) The vowels in first syllables are retracted to almost nothing, depending on a local dialect. 

Although, "dialect" is a linguistic term, many people would deny they speak a "dialect" because of its connotation of "speaking a spoiled version of a language which is used correctly elsewhere". There also are some political/regulatory factors that take place, and each country naturally prefers to have their own regulatory institutions, rather than depending on a neighbor's book named, e.g., "Standard Serbo-Croatian", and each country would claim that their Serbo-Croatian is correct, while others are "dialects". 

As a native speaker, let me try to describe it. To be most specific, I will refer Ukrainian and Russian. Short rules: 

Filipino is a standardized register/dialect of Tagalog language. There exist other, non-standard, dialects of Tagalog. Each of those have differences to each other (e.g., if they were absolutely matching, they would be not considered different ones). The Wikipedia article on Tagalog lists several important differences between the dialects of Tagalog language, including differences to the standard register (Filipino). This includes phonology (glottal stops and consonants), morphology (suffixes), and more. 

Yes, there are many existing services doing exactly what you are asking for. For instance, the one at reverso.net. I'm not affiliated with them, but I'm using it sometimes when I'm not sure about my wording as English is not my first language. Here's a screenshot: 

(image produced by the interface that provides online access to the LinGO English Resource Grammar). You may have notice that most common phrases have various ways to be parsed into a semantic graph. You have to use some algorithms figuring out the most probable variant. Please don't be discouraged by the complexity; it's not that terrible. :) For most practical tasks, you don't have to get into the full depth of analysis. However, knowing theoretical key points will let you focus your attention on practical implementation. Also, I would suggest attending some courses that can provide you with some basis. For instance, Coursera has free course of NLP, and they also have a series of videos that may be useful. 

Thai case is especially interesting since an opposite pattern is very common: consonants are often skipped from the consonant clusters: 

In an addition to hippietrail's great answer, here's the visual representation of English diphthongs as it appears here: 

There's no hyperonym covering the above terms, voice, tense, aspect, and mood|modality. However, there is an informal term TAM which stands for "Tense–Aspect–Mood", also known as TMA (Tense–Modality–Aspect). Also, you may find the term of "verbal categories" in some works. 

Update: (A) Fundamental frequency contours of the four Mandarin Chinese tones (spoken by a female speaker of Mandarin). Each tone on the syllable represents a different lexical item. “ma1” is the level tone, “ma2” the rising tone, “ma3” the dipping tone, and “ma4” the falling tone. (B) Fundamental frequency contours of the five Thai tones (spoken by a female speaker of Thai). Each tone on the syllable represents a different lexical item. “ma0” is the mid level tone, “ma1” the low level tone, “ma2” the falling tone, “ma3” the high level tone, and “ma4” the rising tone. 

Counter-examples Moreover, there are many evidences when consonants evolved to a larger extent than vowels. Sanskrit had rather a poor vowels set ( plus phonated ), but it has developed a huge consonants list, including such exotic ones like ব্ধ্ব or ন্ধ্ব . No surprise that modern languages evolved from Sanskrit (e.g., Thai, Lao, Hindi) dramatically simplified the consonants, while the vowels actually retained. So, the answer is: 

Here, VP is , but the V itself splits into two words around its VP, which can't be represented with a nice tree. In a language-agnostic semantic graph, there is no such problem. 

Where is The result data would be an array of such structures. Step 2, analyzing the training set Build the same data for the training set. Your training set most likely does not contain a representative number of sentences. But this is not a problem since you already have weights from a significantly larger corpus. Hence, 

Look at the ancient texts. They are full of scribal abbreviations which took place for very same reason: cost of the media. Also, if it has not ruined the languages before, why should we consider it a threat today? Emoticons (smileys) are part of this process You are correct, emoticons seem to be an interesting phenomenon as they are actually ideographic symbols appearing in alphabetic scripts. They evolve exactly the same way as the ideographic symbols have evolved. Their goal is to convey a certain meaning while using minimum of the space. 

There are even examples in English. Imagine a situation when two people with high social status (and hence using "high" language among themselves) discuss someone else's rude behavior: 

Note that the phonological value of consonant clusters may vary even within the same language, across its various dialects. Other languages As consonant clusters exist in many languages, they may appear contracted in different ways. Greek language has variety of consonant clusters and quite a complicated set of rules of their contraction. Most notable one is maybe ντ = /d/: 

Also, Wikipedia article contains a list of alternative forms of question marks in Armenian, Greek, Arabic, and Mandarin Chinese languages. 

ปู่ — paternal grandfather; ย่า — paternal grandmother; ตา — maternal grandfather; ยาย — maternal grandmother; 

and so on. So, when a rendering engine performs typesetting, it takes those characters in their natural order: 

I've seen many cases when people who speak different languages make a common mistake spelling words. They add an extra sound (usually, a consonant) while there is no historic or linguistic evidence this sound is necessary nor it was there in the past. 

If we step off linguistic terminology to some philosophy, everything becomes more straightforward. Adjectives define properties of "things"; Adverbs define properties of "relations". 

Links: exact page, title page. In modern Slavonic languages, indeed, these suffixed often reduce. Ukrainian (my native language): the infinitive suffix remains the same, while the 3rd person singular present suffix reduces: "читати" → "читає" or even "чита" in Western dialects. On the contrary, the modern Russian reduced suffix in the infinitive form while it retains 3rd person singular present suffix: "читать" → "читает" . So, as we can see, the distinction between Ukrainian and Russian suggests that both suffixes may retract independently.
