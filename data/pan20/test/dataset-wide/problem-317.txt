Forgive me for saying so, but your question sounds like the kind of thing my highly liberal friends would both suggest and honestly wonder why anyone wouldn't think it would work. The premise is usually along the lines of, "if you understood how your actions hurt others, you'd be disinclined to act that way." Thus, shared experiences would make the world an utopia. There are at least three truths to remember: 1) The average person may even believe they would want this, but when forced to admit the necessary consequence of no privacy whatsoever, suddenly they would realize all the vices that would result in embarrassment on the low end and abject terror on the high end. We have all made mistakes and may even continue to do so, but to air all that dirty laundry? What such a world would soon realize is that the average person pretty much always feels some kind of pain — and it would be impossible to make all of it go away. 

I'm going to go with "can't be done." 2,000 people a day (I'm assuming adults based on your offered statistics) or 730,000 people a year would be beyond noticable, even if you're harvesting planet-wide. Approximately 55 million people die each year (source). You're talking about one out of every 75 people. The collaborating government would need to come up with some way to convince people the deaths were natural, the cremations were expected, and that the lack of a body between last-breath and first-flame wasn't a big deal. Facebook would be glowing hot with conspiracy theories within a month. As mentioned in your comments, corpses might be a solution... but we're back to swapping them out somehow. The consipiracy would be enormous --- and it's difficult to believe. Sorry, mate. But while people may come up with some clever ideas, you need to seriously reduce that number for any of them to be believable. It would be easier to explain the dissapearance of 200 winos a day by colluding with the city governments of some big cities than 2000 people generally. Unfortunately, there aren't enough winos and homeless people for that number to not be noticed very quickly. EDIT: I'm not even going to go with 200 winos — because even that is per-day. If you spread it out among the 100 largest cities in the world, maybe... but now you're talking about a massive shipping conspiracy to get the people to the dinner table. Having said this. Take the time to look into how the Nazis were shipping and killing the Jews during WWII. It's a morbid subject and an utterly distasteful (if not downright insulting) reason to use the historical context, but it's the closest you'll get to the complexities of genocidal behavior. And at the quantities you're proposing, it's genocidal behavior. EDIT: A coment by @Ando-Jurai suggests a solution. Given that our enterprising aliens have a decent storage technology, they could periodically manipulate the world to war to hide harvesting. If they have the ability to generate earthquakes, they could do the same. I'm still worried about the numbers involved. You'd have to devestate very high populated areas to hide the take. But, maybe... 

So your spider mech has an advantage over wheeled or (worse) tread tanks in that it can better keep its balance, hop out of harm's way, perhaps even right itself when knocked over (if they're designed well). Have you ever tried to tip an Abrams back on its treads? I haven't, but I bet it takes more than a couple of big Tongans to do it. At literally everything else, legs stink I'm assuming we're comparing apples to apples by talking about manned mechs. The arguments for drones are very, very different because you can make the mech (comparatively) very, very small. Wheels/treads are great when there's enough weight to keep them solidly in touch with the ground. They're less valuable when the object being moved is very light. (1) Let's add some armor to that boxer. And a big ol' gun. Let's let him look a bit like the combat dudes from StarCraft.1 Suddenly you're having to add all kinds of mechanical enhancement to the armor — and you'd think you're doing that to enhance the combat abilities of the wearer, but you're spending most of the energy just moving the armor. In the same way that most of your gasoline is being used to move the car... not you. So, the more armor you add to the mech, the less valuable the legs become because adding enhancement to overcome the weight is seriously a losing battle. As armor increases, the mechanics to move the armor increases, the fuel needed to power the mechanics increases, all of which adds stress to complicated joints... and all you really wanted to do was kick the other guy's butt.2 Armor almost always succumbs to armament. You don't see plate mail anymore because rifles pack enough punch at enough distance that you might as well be standing there begging them to shoot you ... which is what you'd actually be doing. (2) Now let's add tree roots, bushes, things that are easily squashed and driven over with wheels and treads but are an amazing hang-up for legs. The issue isn't tripping, the issue is the inability to move a hung-up leg forward, which means you're a sitting duck.3 (3) And your center of gravity, which is high for anything with legs but low for (almost anything) with wheels or treads (monster trucks violate this rule... but that's outside the scope of your question). A high center of gravity means it's easier to make the unit unbalanced, tip it over, or control it with trip wires (see my last point). It also raises the unit unecessarily high off the ground, making it an easier target. (4) Then think about speed. This is where legs really, really stink. It doesn't matter how much you enhance joints, wheels and treads can always out run legs. (5) Finally, add to this the increased complexity of affecting knees, ankles, hips, rotor cuffs, tendons, muscles, and a whole lot more. There's an engineering axiom that, frankly, should be considered a Universal Law. KISS: Keep it simple, stupid! Those cool mechs, gundam, and all other things robotic used to fight Godzilla and who knows what else from the 8th Dimension and Beyond are just that... cool... and absolutely useless. Complicated design and automation that can only be driven by an operator with a PhD in physics costing bazillions of dollars and it's all wasted by a single shot from some crazy dude with a big ol' gun that cost pennies on the dollar to build compared to your mech and that can be aimed and fired by a 10-year-old hiding behind a rock. So, looks cool in anime, but in real life the cost-to-value ratio is way, way, way in favor of wheels and treads. If you really want mechs in your story, you need to do what all previous authors have done... you need to declare it to be so and move on with the story, because you'll never be able to justify the tech. 

First of all, see the movies The Price of Life and its modern remake, In Time, which explore the idea of the personal use of time (the number of seconds we have on Earth) as a currency. Stories like this have trouble (other than as morality tales for "use your time wisely") because you need to establish a fair trade? An engineer's time is more valuable from a productivity point of view than a burger-flipper. From a morality point of view they're equal. A politician will always believe his/her time is more valuable than everyone else's. Everyone else will always believe a politician isn't worth a plug second. Further, what does it mean (and how do you do it) to get "more time?" Something must change in physiology to allow an intrinsically intangible idea to extend life. 

It's the third point, outlying bases, that would create the cold war condition. Strategic placement of bases (usually to "protect" allied nations, who tend to be allied because there's a whomping big military force inside their borders) is what would create the condition of zugzwang. Without long-distance ballistic weapons of mass destruction, you would need to move on a lot of bases simultaneously to overcome the zugzwang condition. Which all suggests that mobility is your greatest weapon. He who can move the fastest might overcome the condition of zugzwang and win the war. 

All you really have left is wood, pottery, glass, ... and chemistry. While most of life would be a lot like the 1200s or earlier, there's the possibility that some chemistry knowledge was kept alive. That means poisons, acids, combustables, and a bazzillion other ways to kill your neighbor (oh, and a few good things like fertilizer, but since your horses only have wooden ploughs, there's only so much fertilizer can do for you) are still around. Glass etching would be high art. If there is any advanced knowledge left over, chemistry will be it. Without it you won't even have the 1200s. You'll have the stone age with arrows. The western hemisphere tribal cultures long before conquest come to mind. Prepare for the AtlAtl tournament! 

However, I can imagine other reasons. A Peaceful Life In your question you point out that well-educated Coop is forced to be a farmer and doesn't like it. I think you'd be surprised how many people like coop would jump at the chance to colonize a world even if it meant losing all of our modern technology. Some would do it for the challenge (see below). But many would do it for the quite life it provides. Food for the Homeland What if you weren't an engineer or scientist? What if the Earth's population needed food and stellar transportation became cheap enough to move the proverbial boatloads of wheat? Can you imagine the number of farmers (and non-farmers) who would jump at the chance to homestead a new world, even if it meant both indentured servitude to Mother Earth and the loss of all technology (other than what might be imported due to the transportation)? Because It's There Finally, humanity is generally colonial. We've migrated and expanded all our lives. We pretty much can't stand not knowing a secret or not conquering a challenge. If there was a habitable planet out there, no matter the consequence to technology, there would be someone willing to colonize it. Some might do it just to thumb their nose at the rest of humanity, but others would do it just because.... 

Let's get magic out of the way first Magic allows you to do anything unless you've developed a magic system with limitations. Therefore, of course, you can always solve the problem with magic. A light bulb depends on a LOT of technology People new to the site (welcome, by the way!) have yet to be exposed to the fact that technology is a pyramid. We're standing at the top, and the pyramid represents the countless people, ideas, innovations, and work involved with bringing new technology to light. A simple light bulb is a great example. Off the top of my head you need: 

The problem is information density Sound can be manipulated in far more ways than your body can. Consequently, you can convey more information more quickly with sound than you can with body language. Now, you didn't tell us the tech level of your species nor did you describe their physiology. Let's assume they're human. Humans can process a vast amount of information visually, but we can't wave our hands fast enough to beat speech. But let's say we have four arms (curse you John Carter!). Now you've doubled the information density of body language. Combine that with a simpler life (e.g., pre-renaissance), and I could suspend my disbelief and accept dual-mode communication. But, we want flying cars! Now we need a reason to reduce the information density of the spoken word. One way would be to evolve a tongue or a throat that makes complex sound more difficult. Another way would be to add something to the atmosphere that dampens sound (either making speech beyond a foot hard to hear or that forced the ear to evolve with much less sensitivity to protect itself). OK, now we have a reason for dual-mode communication and we still get flying cars! But it's not enough! I want to hear that pin drop! The only thing I can think of would be for the body language mode to not represent a complete language. Instead, it would represent inflection (as we do in spoken speech) such that (e.g.) a hand waving to my left would mean I'm being sarcastic... etc. This would actually add quite a bit of depth to spoken language — right up until you need to communicate with pilots or anyone else via radio, then the body language element would most likely disappear (in a similar manner to cursive writing in U.S. schools, it's simply not needed anymore, so it's becoming an anachronism). 

You're using one mathematical concept that doesn't completely fit with our empirical universe, so let's use another. Tachyons are theoretical particles that travel faster than the speed of light, which (I think) overcomes all the intrinsic problems associated with the Alcubierre drive. But what about causality? Disclaimer: I am not a theoretical physicist. If a PhD in physics suggests that what I'm about to say is hooey, I defer to their judgment. In the examples of communciation using Tachyons (such as the tachyonic antitelephone), the example is always communication between one relativistic position and one non-relativistic position... allowing (theoretically) the message to be received before it was sent. However, I've not found (and didn't look hard for) an example of communiction between two relativistic positions. In the case of your ship, both ships are moving within the same intertial frame despite being physically disconnected. Due to this, causality should be preserved (IhopeIhopeIhope). 

Even the shapes of things (like the seats) would bring new innovation to the Romans. Crafty little honkers, those Romans. There are things they wouldn't be able to comprehend. Microelectronics, for one. Laser optics for another. Microscopes weren't invented until 1590, but as @RadovanGarabik points out, they could learn telescopes from the tank's manual optics... which could lead to microscopes ... which could lead to looking at the small stuff. They still wouldn't figure out microelectronics, but they would suddenly learn about electricity and have the ability to examine nearly everything about it. Software would be beyond them, but who cares when you suddenly have electric lighting? Could they duplciate that tank? Nope. I can't imagine how they could learn alloy lamination that quickly, for example. But I wouldn't sell the Romans short. They could and would learn a tremendous amount of stuff from a modern tank. BTW, one assumes that nothing on the tank is locked, that they have access to the cabin and the motor compartments, etc. Perhaps not the ability to turn it on, but if the "key were in the ignition," so to speak, they'd eventually ask themselves, "what does that doohickey do?" and start the beast. The OP's question is sensless if they're locked out. But even then, they could learn stuff just from the outside. 

Which means the "something" you've invented a 1940s airplane in the early 1800s. There's no other sensible way to use the vehicle. Or, better said, someone would quickly invent the "airplane" to take advantage of the potential maneuverability of the vehicle. The first time someone did that, all other uses would become obsolete. My model for this conclusion is the development of ironclad ships during the U.S. Civil War. Several inventors figured out how to use heavy, crappy steel and steam engines to create armored ships. To paraphrase a famous documentarian: on the evening the Monitor and Merrimack opened fire, every other navy on earth was obsolete. 

Island: A small parcel of land wholly surrounded by water. Islet: A smaller parcel of land wholly surrounded by water. Cay: An even smaller parcel of land wholly surrounded by water, usually quite low (if it has a hill, it's an islet). 

The answer to your question depends on how you want to justify the creation of super-sized humans. Consider all the very real problems. Bones must be either larger or more dense to bear the weight. Muscles must either multiply or become larger to move around. But would you need a bigger brain? The dinosaurs generally didn't (other than the really big ones needing a second brain for motor control... all those muscles...). Most of science fiction has dealt with super-sized people from the perspective of the 50-Foot Woman: volume is increasing, but density isn't, so intellect (cognation) wouldn't change. But if your story actually delves into what would be needed to make a seriously bigger human being, then your brain(s) must match what you've done with the body. Note, though, that dinosaurs weren't smarter having two brains, they just had more complex motor control. That might be all you get. 

Please remember that time is a somewhat arbitrary concept that has only been refined through mathematical expression (and the fact that so many "constants" are wacko numbers to the nth decimal place might mean that our "second" is still fairly arbitrary). Therefore, your people really only need to pick a quantity of divisions and use a divisible resource (see above) to mark those divisions and voilà, you can tell time. 

Let's talk about Usain Bolt ...Who ran the 100 meter dash in 9.58 seconds. Or, as we Americans like to say, 23.35mph. That's whomping fast for a human. What are some of the reasons? From this source:
