It looks to me like the scanner that was used to make the PDF split the image into several layers during construction of the PDF in order to reduce the file size while maintaining sharp text. If we look side-by-side at some writing that was not separated into a separate layer and some text that was, we can clearly see the effect (note that I have moved the writing around to get a good side-by-side example): 

Using electricity for heat is a bad idea if you get your electricity from burning fossil fuels. For example, the efficiency of a combined cycle natural gas turbine is at best around 60% (this is the best commonly used technology available). Natural gas space heaters are over 80% efficient (see e.g. here). So even if you have a use for the waste heat from your lighting, it's inefficient to generate heat from electricity. If all your energy comes from nuclear power, wind, hydro, or solar, then it is reasonable to simply use incandescent bulbs. Otherwise, you should preferentially use fossil fuels for heating. 

Thus, the existence of multiple layers in no way is evidence that the document is not authentic. This is the standard way for scanners/copiers to handle scanned-document-to-PDF conversions. Upon review of the document, I can't find an instance of the font "not making sense". Looks like a typewriter to me, and the same one used for the whole document (complete with artifacts that I recall seeing before, like partially shifted caps). 

Appearance is governed by relatively few genes compared to the total number (better studied in dogs than humans), so appearance alone isn't a good indication that you share genes with others. Humans have a strong tendency to be altruistic towards an in-group and hostile towards an out-group (Wikipedia has a good summary). Part of the evolutionary advantage of this may come from factors you describe (i.e. those genes that promote that behavior tend to be found in reproductively successful tribes; and people within a tribe look a bit more similar than those outside, so it's something to run the in/out distinction off of). 

The very wealthy tend not to spend all that much of their money on things that are typically subject to consumption tax. According to Forbes (in 2006; much clicking needed to find the data), the only category where Americans with incomes in the top 20% vastly outspend those in the bottom 20% (fractionally) is in insurance and pensions, neither of which is normally taxed. (Forbes doesn't mention investment, but this also follows similar trends.) Even if you avoid taxing food, this really shifts the relative burden not "progressively" more to higher income earners, but centrally to middle-income earners. If you added a VAT to second residences and to investments not covered by FDIC, then maybe there would be a case for progressivity. As it is, the article says (emphasis mine): 

Another edit: This site presents the same conclusion (thanks to fred for finding it), albeit without a clear demonstration, and with some technical inaccuracies. 

Edit: this site shows all the layers (thanks to geoff for finding it). You can verify them for yourself by loading the PDF into a vector graphics tool like Adobe Illustrator or Inkscape and ungrouping the pieces. 

Yes, it is true to the extent that we can date accurately (see the Wikipedia links you provided, or this summary article). The best estimates right now are that Mitochondrial Eve lived 200+-13 kya, while Y-chromosomal Adam lived 142+-15 kya. It is also true that Genesis describes Noah and his three sons (one Y chromosome) and his wife and sons' wives (4 different mitochondria) as the human passengers on Ark. However, this is just about exactly meaningless. The genetic data doesn't agree very well with this sort of arrangement, especially since there would need to be a massive population expansion after the ark, which means that many male lineages would trace back to a common choke-point; the lineage would look more like a comb than a tree. Instead, the branching pattern seems like a typical tree expected from a more stable population size (see picture on Wikipedia, for example). But so much other genetic data profoundly disagrees with this (e.g. the genetic age of pretty much any allelic variation in humans should be no more than the mitochondrial age of Eve, more or less, and this is absolutely not what is found) that Biblical literalists can only rationally accept such drastically different processes than we observe now that one can draw no conclusions about what happened back then. 

Plastic (e.g. polyethylene) is made mostly of hydrocarbon chains. So is oil (both lipids (organic) and inorganic alkanes (paraffin, etc.)). Both of these substances are hydrophobic, so it's hard to get them to mix into water--and you are washing your plastics with water, not DMSO or something, right? But long hydrocarbon chains are happy to stick to each other, as you can tell by looking at melting and boiling points of long alkanes (the more you want to stick, the hotter you have to be before you melt/boil). On the other hand, it's not as though oil somehow knows that plastic was made from oil. It's simply a property of the chemical interactions. Other surfaces that are lipophilic will have the same hard-to-wash property. Incidentally, there is research (example) into materials that are both lipophobic and strongly hydrophobic, because almost nothing likes to stick to these and thus the surfaces are "self-cleaning". 

It reminded me of a claim I read in an American Institutions class long ago that racism displayed by Caucasians against Native Americans didn't really set in when it was mostly male trappers and explorers interacting with Native Americans; it was only when women arrived that racism got really bad. At the time, I wondered if that was actually true or just sounded good (to male textbook writers!), and decided that historical records were probably not accurate enough to settle the matter (even of the order of events, let alone to establish causality). But the claim in Ms. Sanchez' slide is apparently about the situation today. It's not entirely clear what the context was of the presentation, but Ms. Sanchez recently wrote a USA Today article about the tech sector in general where she makes a similar but weaker set of claims. So at least with the (lack of) context presented by Business Insider, it sounds like the claim is: "Some of the biggest barriers to diversity and inclusion in technology are white women". (From context, we can probably assume this means "in the U.S.".) The statement, in this form, has been picked up by number of niche regular and social media outlets (including Reddit, BZNews, etc.). But is it true? There ought to be a good deal of diversity data that could shed light on the situation. For instance, if there was an inverse correlation between ethnic diversity and white-female-to-white-male ratio in tech companies, it would demonstrate that the claim is true for at least some metric of diversity or inclusiveness. 

Fifty? Pah! Try one hundred. These sorts of feats of strength are not very useful, though, even if they are possible, just like humans don't routinely lift the kinds of weights that champion weightlifters do. Leafcutter ants, who specialize in cutting leaves and carrying the loads back to their nest are probably the most heavily studied load-carriers; they will tend to carry only a few times their body weight. For example, see Roces and HÃ¶lldobler, "Leaf density and a trade-off between load-size selection and recruitment behavior in the ant Atta cephalotes". Oecologia Volume 97, Number 1, pp. 1-8 (1994), Figure 2A, where the 4 mg ants cutting 0.22 mg/mm2 leaves cut about 60 mm2, which gives about 13 mg for a 4 mg ant (3x body weight). 

There is good evidence that, in practice, one should not expect to learn perfect pitch as an adult. One relevant study shows a very clear decline in the rates of having perfect pitch as a function of when musical training began--but that downward trend is swamped by the huge influence of being a native tonal language speaker. Thus, it is quite clear that perfect pitch is not rare given appropriate experience as an infant, but there's a strong suggestion that it gets increasingly hard to learn as one gets older. If you look hard enough, you can probably find an instance of someone learning perfect pitch as an adult, but that would be extraordinary; normally, by the time you're an adult, your opportunity to develop perfect pitch has passed. 

tl;dr There are differences, but none which ought to have or have been shown to have a meaningful impact on health. Relatively current research indicates that fatty acid composition varies a small amount between cows treated with rBST and those that are not (and note that this study was on produced milk, so other practices that correlate with rBST usage may actually be causal). The differences are of a few percentage points at most, and are quite unlikely to be significant factors in health. A broader look at various compounds found very little difference in practice between the composition of milk (on average) from sources that used rBST and those that did not. Also, most of the rBST itself that made it into the milk is destroyed during pasteurization. So the answer is tentatively "yes there are detectable differences, but not any that ought to impact health". Note however that rBST causes health complications in cows. So you might want to avoid rBST milk because you prefer not to obtain milk from cows that are even less comfortable than normal, but it is probably not rational to avoid it for health reasons unless you habitually alter behavior to avoid even low-risk events. 

You can read the answer right off the study: no, lack of intelligence is not the main reason because the correlation coefficient between IQ and various measures of religiosity are not that large (e.g. -0.25 for fundamentalism). It is an important reason, as is education (as the study explains, the correlation persists when level of education is accounted for). A combination of extreme education and IQ does seem to be enough to virtually eliminate strong religious belief. (This is a broadly supported conclusion, though causation is not determined.) The inverse correlation with IQ holds, at least roughly, with belief in the paranormal also--the effect is frequently seen but is not so strong as to appear to be the only important factor. The other factors are hard to pin down. Some studies indicate that religiosity of children (once adult) is not strongly correlated to that of their parents; others find cases where the transmission is more reliable. Religious beliefs of friends and spouse are strongly correlated (see first link), but it is unclear to what extent this is cause vs. a consequence of having the beliefs. There is very likely some strong societal or parental component given that, for example, 2/3 of the residents of Utah identify as Mormon, and the "natural increase" of the population is considerably larger than the "net migration" (as found in a table of Utah demographics linked here). 

tl;dr: No, cockatoos output ~3000x less sound energy than jet engines, even taking claims of 135 dB at face value. Loudness measurements are, broadly speaking, a mess when it comes to answering questions like these. Loudness is often measured for occupational health and safety reasons, and in these situations you put the microphone at the natural distance from the noise source. Here's a good reference on loudness; the writing quality is a little shaky but the technical data seems sound. As usual, Wikipedia has a decent article on sound pressure also. Unfortunately, decibel numbers for birds seem to be widely spread without distances or citations; there are YouTube videos of Moluccans which are incredibly loud but it's very difficult to estimate even orders of magnitude from that. In any case, although I cannot find at what distance the Moluccan cockatoo was measured (or even if it really was), it is presumably in normal ranges for people who are around screeching cockatoos (a few meters). Also, note that jet engines do not radiate sound equally in all directions; they're a lot louder from the back than from the side. So this leaves us to conclude that the comparison is essentially meaningless. However, one can as a closely related but sensible question: at the presumably loudest point around either a jet engine or cockatoo, how far away does each have to be for the two to sound comparably loud? If we speculate that the 135 dB level is for about 3 meters, Wikipedia has a jet engine at 150 dB at 30 meters (which matches the top end of the 110-140 dB range at 100 meters). Another 5 dB is 3x more less power per unit area, or sqrt(3) ~= 1.7x more distance, so a jet engine at 170 meters is probably roughly comparable to a Moluccan cockatoo shriek at 3 meters. Since this is around 55x farther away, we can estimate that jet engines put out about 552 ~= 3000x more sound energy than the cockatoo. (Maybe somewhat less for the jet engine, given the reduced sound to the side.) More relevant is probably that if you want your cockatoo to be only as loud as a rock concert (~110 dB; also about equal to a chainsaw that you're holding), you will probably have to be about 50 meters away from it*. *25 dB drop is a decrease in power of 300 times, sqrt(300) = 17 times farther away; 3m*17 = 51m
