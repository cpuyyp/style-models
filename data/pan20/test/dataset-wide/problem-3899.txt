By "proper" here I mean a theorem that is about the properties of a countable set of (first-order) sentences as they are reflected in the properties of their models. That is to say, in the case of Putnam's theorem (which I think is improper), it seems to me that it doesn't really say anything about $ZF$ - instead it describes the metatheory in which it is interpreted using model-theoretic language (and succeeds in doing so by assuming an outer $\omega$ and $\mathbb{P}(\omega)$ which exist independently of the metatheory or the particular set theory being interpreted.) And the related question: 

Please don't get put off by the length, all the questions are quite simple, but given the quasi-mathematical context I tried to be precise with the formulation. The more mathematically interesting title question (and the one that's most important for my purposes) is the last one, so if anything please take a look at the end. Here goes. In his paper Models and Reality (1980) pg. 468 ($URL$ Hilary Putnam states and proves the following theorem: 

That said, students will most likely encounter Sylow p-groups before Galois Theory. But that's not really an argument against providing the proof of FTA as a 'spectacular' application - especially if students are familiar with some basic field theory. The Galois theory it uses is in any case very elementary. And of course the key step is to show that $\vert$Gal$(k/\mathbb{R})\vert = 2^m$ which cannot be done without Sylow. If anything this application illustrates exactly what a course on group theory should illustrate which is that a lot of analytic-flavoured questions involve insights that are much more adequately generalized in the framework of algebraic structures. (Of course some elementary analytic facts are still required in the proof.) 

EDIT: After comments and answers received have edited (and expanded) the question. Hope it is clear and unambiguous now. 

On leafing through some papers of John Nash (available online on his webpage) I found this intriguing little observation: 

In general it seems to me obviously not - any version of the strong LST uses some notion of cardinality which surely cannot apply to $L$. What am I missing here? Putnam does add that strictly speaking the Skolem hull construction is also needed, but I don't see how that would help. Can it? I will tag this as a reference request too, in case someone knows whether this theorem has been published elsewhere - by Putnam or otherwise. (His footnote says that he proved it in 1963 but provides no more information.) 

Take a (WLOG) normal extension $k$ of $\mathbb{R}$ of degree $n$ and a 2-subgroup $H$ of $G=$Gal$(k/\mathbb{R}$). Then $[\text{Fix}(H):\mathbb{R}]=\vert G \vert / \vert H \vert $ and hence since $H$ is a 2-group $n$ must be odd and hence trivial. So $G=H$, i.e. $\vert G \vert = 2^m$ Therefore, by taking a subgroup $N$ of $G$ of index $2$ show that Fix$(N)/\mathbb{R}$ is $\mathbb{R}(\theta)$ for a negative square root $\theta$ and hence that Fix$(N)=\mathbb{C}$. Then by a quick argument Gal$(k/\text{Fix}(N))=$Gal$(k/\mathbb{C})=1$ and hence $k=\mathbb{C}$. Hence $\mathbb{C}$ is the only extension of $\mathbb{R}$ and the FTA follows immediately. 

If $B$ is a Boolean algebra, then a mapping $f:B\rightarrow B$ is said to be contractive (or a contraction) if $f(a)+f(b)\leq a+b$ for each $a,b\in B$ where $a+b=(a\wedge b')\vee(a'\wedge b)$ is the sum in the corresponding Boolean ring. Suppose that $B$ is a Boolean algebra such that for each contractive mapping $f:B\rightarrow B$, the maximum $Max_{b\in B}f(b)$ is achieved by some $b\in B$. Then is $B$ necessarily complete? What about when we assume that $B$ is originally $\sigma$-complete? I am looking for counterexamples, so I would be interested in seeing what kinds of counterexamples one could construct even if a counterexample is found. Every contractive function on a complete Boolean algebra attains its maximum: If $B$ is complete and $f:B\rightarrow B$ is contractive. Suppose that $c=\bigvee_{b\in B}f(b)$. Then there is a partition $p$ of $c$ such that for each $a\in p$, there is some $b_{a}\in B$ with $a\leq f(b_{a})$. Let $x=\bigvee_{a\in p}b_{a}\wedge a$. Then $f(x)'\wedge a\geq f(x)'\wedge f(b_{a})\geq f(x)+f(b_{a})\leq x+b_{a}\leq a'$, so $f(x)'\wedge a=0$, hence $f(x)'\leq a'$, thus $a\leq f(x)$. Therefore $f(x)\geq\bigvee_{a\in p}a=c$. However, I am unsure if this theorem holds for more general classes of Boolean algebras besides complete Boolean algebras. 

$\mathbf{Proof}$ $\rightarrow$. This direction has been proven already in the above lemma. $\leftarrow$. Suppose $a\in L$ is colinear. Let $c=\bigwedge\{x\in L|a\vee x=1\}$. Then $a\vee c=1$ as well by colinearity. Now suppose that $a\wedge c\neq 0$. Then by subfitness, there is some $x\neq 1$ with $1=x\vee(a\wedge c)=(x\vee a)\wedge(x\vee c)$. Therefore $x\vee a=1$, so $x\geq c$, hence $x\geq x\vee c=1>x$, a contradiction. We therefore conclude that $a\wedge c=0$, so $a$ and $c$ are complements. $\mathbf{QED}$ In particular, if $L$ is a subfit frame and $L^{*}$ is the lattice with the same underlying set as $L$ but with the reverse ordering, then $L^{*}$ is a frame if and only if $L$ is a complete Boolean algebra. Also, if $X$ is a $T_{1}$-space and $\mathcal{C}$ is the lattice of closed sets of $X$, then $\mathcal{C}$ is a frame if and only if $X$ is discrete. All these facts about frames can be found in Picado and Pultr's new book [1]. 

I proved the above proposition just now to answer this question, so I am unsure if reducing ternary associative operations to binary associative operations has been investigated before (let me know if you find any reference where reducing ternary associative operations to binary associative operations has been studied before). It seems like the above proposition generalizes to n-ary operations as well (I have not verified this yet). Unfortunately, the above proposition does not seem to work very well for having two sided identities for either of the operations $*$ or $\#$. The following proposition (with a trivial proof) relates ternary identities to binary identities.

This property in question 1 does not hold for many models of ZFC. In particular, if $\mathcal{U},\mathcal{V}$ are two non-Rudin Keisler equivalent selective ultrafilters, then $P_{\mathcal{U}}\simeq P_{\mathcal{V}}\simeq\{0,1\}$. In particular, under CH or more generally MA, there are $2^{\mathfrak{c}}$ non-Rudin Keisler equivalent ultrafilters on $\omega$. Furthermore, if there are two distinct measurable cardinals, then the normal ultrafilters $\mathcal{U}_{1},\mathcal{U}_{2}$ on those measurable cardinals are not Rudin Keisler equivalent, but $P_{\mathcal{U}_{1}}\simeq P_{\mathcal{U}_{2}}\simeq\{0,1\}$. 

The definitions are indeed equivalent. The idea of 'local smallness' is to get for any $X$,$Y$ in $\mathcal{C}^I$ an object of your indexing category to represent, as it were, all (vertical) morphisms between $X$ and $Y$. Both definitions describe this fact, although Johnstone's is, I guess, slightly more 'general' than it needs to be in that it applies the above property to any $X$ and $Y$ in $\mathcal{C}$ (and not to $X$, $Y$ in the same fibre), but that's OK by Theorem 10.1 in Streicher since $\mathcal{S}$ has finite limits. The equivalence of the definitions can also be proved as exercises 8.8.9 and 8.8.10 in Volume 2 of Borceaux. To see that they are equivalent let for simplicity $X$ and $Y$ lie on the same fibre $I$ (WLOG bearing in mind what I said above.) Then Johnstone's definition says that there exists an arrow $\alpha \colon J \rightarrow I$ and a morphism $f \colon \alpha^*X \rightarrow \alpha^*Y$ such that for any $\beta \colon K \rightarrow I$ and any morphism $g \colon \beta^*X \rightarrow \beta^*Y$ there exists a unique $u: K \rightarrow J$ such that $$u^{*}(f) = g$$ and $\alpha \circ u = \beta$. But now if you write $J$ as $H_{X,Y}$ and $\alpha$ as $h_{X,Y}$ you'll see that the last sentence says exactly that there is a bijection between morphisms $f \colon \beta^*X \rightarrow \beta^*Y$ and morphisms $u$ such that $h_{X,Y} \circ u = \beta$, i.e. between morphisms from $\beta$ to $h_{X,Y}$ in $\mathcal{S}/I$. And this is exactly the second definition. 

I suspect his terminology might be idiosyncratic, so I'll point out that by an $\omega$-model he means "a model of set theory in which the natural numbers are ordered as they are 'supposed to be'; that is, the sequence of 'natural numbers' of the model is an $\omega$-sequence." My first (not-so-interesting) question is this: 

You can prove that the two theories are, in fact, equivalent. By induction (NB: 'meta-induction') on the number of parameters, we can reduce the claim to the case where you have a theory $T$ with the usual induction schema and a theory $T'$ that is an extension of $T$ by a one-parameter induction schema. So assume $T$ and $T'$ are not equivalent. This implies that there is a model $\mathcal{M} \vDash T'$ and a two-place open sentence $\phi(x,y)$ such that $$\mathcal{M} \vDash \phi(0,\beta) \wedge (\forall x (\phi(x,\beta) \rightarrow \phi(x+1,\beta))) $$ but also, $$\mathcal{M} \nvDash \forall x \phi(x,\beta)$$ for some $\beta \in \mathcal{M}$. But note now that the above is equivalent to $$ \mathcal{M} \vDash \exists y (\phi(0,y) \wedge (\forall z (\phi(z,y) \rightarrow \phi(z+1,y))) \wedge \neg \forall z \phi(z,y) $$ and if you call this last sentence $S$ then you get that $S \wedge \phi ' (x)$ violates the usual induction-schema, where $\phi ' (x)$ is the one-place open sentence we get by by closing $y$ under the existential quantifier in $S$. That is to say we have $S \wedge \phi ' (0)$ and $ \forall x (S \wedge \phi ' (x) \rightarrow S \wedge \phi ' (x+1))$ but not $\forall x S \wedge \phi ' (x)$. But that is a contradiction since $\mathcal{M}$ is a model of $T$. Hence the two theories are equivalent. 

Let me point out $n$-ary operations that appear in my own research. An algebra $(X,*)$ is said to be self-distributive if $x*(y*z)=(x*y)*(x*z)$ for all $x,y,z\in X$. The notion of self-distributivity can be generalized to identities involving operations of higher arity. We say that an $n+1$-ary operation $t:X^{n+1}\rightarrow X$ if self-distributive if $$t(x_{1},\ldots,x_{n},t(y_{1},\ldots,y_{n},y))$$ $$=t(t(x_{1},\ldots,x_{n},y_{1}),\ldots,t(x_{1},\ldots,x_{n},y_{n}),t(x_{1},\ldots,x_{n},y)$$ (see here and here). The notion of a Laver table can be extended to $n$-ary operations. You may compute the $n$-ary Laver tables here and here. 

$\mathbf{Theorem}$ Suppose that $X$ is a $\kappa$-complete space. Then the following are equivalent. 

If $j$ is a function with $V_{\lambda+1}\subseteq\mathrm{Dom}(f)$, then define a mapping $j\upharpoonright_{\lambda+1}:V_{\lambda+1}\rightarrow V_{\lambda+1}$ by letting $j\upharpoonright_{\lambda+1}(A)=j(A)\cap V_{\lambda}$ for each $A\subseteq V_{\lambda}$. Suppose that $\lambda$ is an inaccessible cardinal. Then we shall say that a function $f:V_{\lambda+1}\rightarrow V_{\lambda+1}$ is an extendibility mapping if for all $\alpha>\lambda$ there is some elementary embedding $j:V_{\alpha}\rightarrow V_{\beta}$ where $f=j\upharpoonright_{\lambda+1}$. If $\kappa<\lambda$ and $\lambda$ is inaccessible, then $\kappa$ is extendible if and only if there is some extendibility mapping $f:V_{\lambda+1}\rightarrow V_{\lambda+1}$ with $\mathrm{crit}(f)=\kappa.$ Let $\Phi(f_{1},...,f_{n},\lambda)$ denote the following formula. i. $f_{1},...,f_{n}:V_{\lambda+1}\rightarrow V_{\lambda+1}$ are non-trivial extendibility mappings with $\mathrm{crit}(f_{1})<...<\mathrm{crit}(f_{n})<\lambda$ and $\lambda$ inaccessible, and ii. whenever $1\leq i<j\leq n$ and $\alpha>\lambda$ and $j:V_{\alpha}\rightarrow V_{\beta}$ is an elementary embedding with $j\upharpoonright_{\lambda+1}=f_{j}$ then $(j(f_{i}))\upharpoonright_{\lambda+1}=f_{i}$. Is the existence of $n$ extendible cardinals equiconsistent with the existence of extendibility mappings $f_{1},...,f_{n}:V_{\lambda+1}\rightarrow V_{\lambda+1}$ where $\Phi(f_{1},...,f_{n},\lambda)$ is false? The motivation behind asking this question is that the extendible cardinals begin to have some aspects of the algebras of elementary embeddings and these algebraic properties of the extendible cardinals may be easier to investigate than the algebraic properties at the level around $n$-hugeness and rank-into-rank. I will probably ask more questions like this one in the near future. 

Closure systems also have a nice interpretation in terms of ordered sets and lattices. If $C$ is a closure system, then define a preordering on $C$ where $x\leq y$ if and only if $x\in C^{*}(y)$ if and only if $C^{*}(x)\subseteq C^{*}(y)$. A closure system $(X,C)$ is said to be $T_{0}$ if whenever $x,y\in X$, then there is some $R\in C$ where $x\in R,y\not\in R$ or $x\not\in R,y\in R$. A closure system $(X,C)$ is a $T_{1}$-closure system if $\{x\}\in C$ for each $x\in X$. It is easy to convince yourself that the specialization ordering on a closure system is a preordering and the specialization ordering is a partial ordering if and only if the closure system is a $T_{0}$-closure system. A closure system $(X,C)$ is $T_{1}$ if and only if $x\leq y\Rightarrow x=y$ in the specialization ordering. In essence, the specialization ordering is trivial for spaces and closure systems that satisfy any sort of separation axioms, but the specialization ordering is very interesting for spaces and closure systems without the $T_{1}$-separation axiom. For instance, the specialization ordering gives a one-to-one correspondence between the topological spaces on finite sets and finite partial orderings as was mentioned in the answers by Todd Trimble and Tom Goodwillie. A based lattice is a pair $(L,A)$ such that $L$ is a complete lattice and where $L=\{\bigvee R|R\subseteq A\}$. If $(L,A),(M,B)$ are based lattices, then a based lattice homomorphism from $(L,A)$ to $(M,B)$ is a function $f:L\rightarrow M$ that preserves all least upper bounds (i.e. $\bigvee f[R]=f(\bigvee R)$ whenever $R\subseteq L$) and where $f(a)\in B$ whenever $a\in A$. The category of based lattices is equivalent to the category of $T_{0}$-closure systems by the following functors. For notation, if $X$ is a poset and $A\subseteq X$, then let $\downarrow_{A}x=\{a\in A|a\leq x\}$, and let $\downarrow x=\{a\in X|a\leq x\}$. If $(L,A)$ is a based lattice, then $(A,\{\downarrow_{A}x|x\in L\})=\mathcal{H}(L,A)$ is a $T_{0}$-closure system and the specialization ordering on $A$ is the ordering inherited from the lattice $L$. If $(X,C)$ is a $T_{0}$-closure system, then $\mathcal{G}(X,C)=(C,\{\downarrow x|x\in X\})$ is a based lattice. The topological closure systems have a few nice characterizations in terms of based lattices. If $L$ is a lattice with least element $0$, then we say that $a\in L\setminus\{0\}$ is join-prime if $a\leq a_{1}\vee a_{2}$ implies $a\leq a_{1}$ or $a\leq a_{2}$. We say that $a\in L\setminus\{0\}$ is join-irreducible if $a=a_{1}\vee a_{2}$ imples $a=a_{1}$ or $a=a_{2}$. Every join-prime element is join-irreducible, and in a distributive lattice, every join-irreducible element is join-prime. $\mathbf{Proposition}$ Let $(L,A)$ be a based lattice. Then the following are equivalent.
