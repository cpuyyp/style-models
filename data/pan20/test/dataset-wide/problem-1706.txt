Good. So it also works for single line cases! Does it work well if the string searched is NOT in the input? Let's try it for (that does NOT exist in the given example): 

Maybe you can do the following: have one open "Command Prompt" window where you run the "ftp command" and have another "Command Prompt" window where you run the query. I hope this helps. 

Raymond Chen, from Microsoft, has written the following "blog post": Why does the Recycle Bin have different file system names on FAT and NTFS? $URL$ From that blog post, let me quote the section that seems to be more relevant to this effect: 

Here's a basic explanation of this awk command: : defines "|" (pipe symbol) as the field separator : only matches lines that start with "VAR_3" : prints the second field / column (that, in this case, contains the value that you want to print) UPDATE (Dec 3, 2015): So, the OP has added a clarifying comment, which leads to conclude that he wants the search to be multiline, considering the lines between two "tokens" as part of the value of the first token. Here's a revised version for the initial example, this time using the "sed" (2 times!) and "head" commands: 

So, to create a split zip archive, you could do the following (the "" is the "recursive" switch to include subdirectories of the directory): 

If I understand the question correctly, you want the "www" group to have 'read', 'write' and 'execute' privileges on the "/opt/apps" folder (directory) and subdirectories. In that case, use the command like this: 

The "" is for applying the sed command to the first line... And we want to NOT include that last line, so we pipe that output to the "head" command with the "" ("MINUS n") switch - specifically "" to exclude the last line: 

My question is the following: is there a way to see the RAID events history / log of the RAID internal controller (a "Smart Array P400")? I would like to be able to use "hpacucli" for that, but I can't find any related command in the Hpacucli Utility for Linux - All Commands Guide I may try to use other tools for this, if required (but not HP iLO - "Integrated Lights-Out" because I don't have that access), preferably avoiding any reboot. I have checked "/var/log/messages" but I haven't found any seemingly related entries there. 

But I'd like to know what else people do for precaution, for example can you backup the entire IIS and all its settings? As re-creating all the sites and application pools etc... would be a real time consuming pain if the worst were to happen? Any tips / advice greatly appreciated 

Does anyone know if it's possible to automate the creation of EBS snapshots from the online EC2 Management console (Say every day or every hour) and then tell it how long to keep them (Pruning them)? I don't use the command line tools, so would hope there is an option (That I can't currently see!) to automate snapshots? I know you can do it via third party applications and sites like Ylastic - But was hoping this would be built in by now? 

I have been doing an audit of my SQL Server log, as I 'thought' it was locked down but appeared to be open and we were getting a lot of password attempts on the SA account. After sorting that, I have noticed throughout the day in the ErrorLog I have entries like this 

I am looking at creating backups of our C: drive in case we have a major HD or OS failure... This is a web server, so I want the fastest way of restoring IIS with all the settings and all the program files (SQL Server etc.) and read the built in 'Windows Server 2008 Backup' is what I should be using. So I basically want the C drive backed up so I can restore it to how it was before a failure... 

And restarted IIS, but nothing changed. It's still blocking Dots in paths. And then I restarted the entire server... And guess what. It's still blocking dots in path? I have no idea what to do next, apart from un-install it? Anyone else this issue? 

I have a web server that I run which has quite a few sites on it now all using SQL Db's - Its actually a cloud server from 1&1 (Win2008). I have the following in place in case of the worst: 

We have a spare Integrity blade (2x Tukwila quad-core + 16Gb RAM) laying around which I would like to use has a Virtual Host for a couple of Linux VMs. I am having some concerns finding the best solutions for our situation (if a solution is possible at all?). Here's what I'm dealing with: 

I have a mounted NTFS partition under Windows (2003) and Linux (RHEL 5.7) at the same time. The LUN resides on SAN and is presented to both servers at the same time. At first, the setup looks ok as I initially can see files from both Windows and Linux. Writes are only initiated from Windows and I mounted the partition under Linux with read only (ro) and no access time (noatime) options. But when I add files from Windows, I can't see them under Linux. Is there anything I'm missing? Is it even possible at all? I would like to achieve this in order to avoid copying from the network for a data migration of > 1Tb. Do you see any other way to do it?

If you really want to use , you need to first select a window with , but be aware this configuration does not configure logging for all windows... 

Use Process accounting Write a shell wrapper based on script or similar and make it the default shell Or use snoopy which uses LD_PRELOAD to wrap around exec system calls and logs it to syslog 

Also, it should be noted that if an account is locked due to too many authentication attemps, you won't see that in /etc/shadow. You can find out the failed logins count of an account with 

Vim has vimdiff mode which is quite good. It obviously works in console mode too. It give you color highlighting of differences and the possibility to edit the diffed files efficiently. Vim is also installable or even installed on most *nix system these days... It is better if you already know Vim though... 

I run a little 1&1 web server with quite a few sites all powered by SQL Express Db's and have never allowed connections to SQL Express from an external resource (Anything not on the server), as I am paranoid of the databases getting hacked if I allow external access. What is the most secure way for me to allow a local program on my computer here to connect to my SQL Server on my 1&1 server? A step by step guide would be excellent :| 

For all the databases on the server. Its doing this more or less every hour? Is that right? I assumed once the database had started thats it unless I restart the SQL service or shut down the server? Any advice appreciated - Thanks. 

I installed UrlScan a few days ago and it seemed to be working fine, however in the log I saw it was blocking lots of files from websites that I didn't want (Explanation here) It's blocking files with Dots in the URL (Especially assets like .js files and .css files). So it broke a lot of sites. So I changed the following as per the docs and that blog post. 

I have an EC2 server (Win2008) which has about 10 sites on it, it's completely locked down apart from ports 80 and 443. I can only access port 3389 and 21 from my home and work IP addresses. Just now I received the following from Amazon: 

However, it's trying to append to the querystring d=9 on that page. But I have double checked that code for that site, and if has a numeric check and cast. And if it fails that (Which it does for the above query), it just returns nothing - Which is what the site is doing, and that SQL would not have been executed. So even more stumped now! Any other pointers appreciated. 

Of course, this is some really basic usage. Read the manual or online how-tos to get more advanced usage. Here's a little how-to about reliable forwarding with rsyslog. To tell your servers to receive logs: 

Right now, I've thought about dd, cp and rsync, but I'm not sure on the best one to use and the best way to use them... 

Elinks which originates from links. It has support for Javascript, tabs, frames, tables... I also like w3m, but I don't think it supports Javascript. 

I personally prefer using process accounting for this kind of activity monitoring. It is also the one that is the most similar to what you are looking for (commands summary, login summary...). 

What I generally do is seperate static content and process it in another location directive. Something like: 

So, to sum up my question, how would you guys go about virtualising x86_64 guests on an Itanium server? 

I'm looking to transfer data across 2 lv of an HP-UX server. I have a couple of those transfers to do, some of which are mostly binary (Oracle tablespace...) and some others are more text files (logs...). Used data size of the volumes is between 100Gb and 1Tb. Also, I will be changing the block size from 1K to 8K on some of these partitions... Things I'm looking for: 

When adding a new drive, it took over /dev/sda1. Now my old drive is /dev/sda2 and it messes with the current fstab setup of the server. I know I can get away with using UUID or labels (what I just did), but I would still prefer having the primary drive take /dev/sda1... So, how do I force a disk to take a particular device number? 

Infrastructures.org has a good checklist of best practices and general guidelines. The information looks a little bit outdated, but most of the things they suggest are still to be considered when setting up a large data center environment. Some of the topics covered:
