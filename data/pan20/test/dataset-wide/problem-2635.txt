A social construction manifests into multiple forms of construction. Social means pertaining to society; a society is multiple people that voluntarily bind each other to a contract or are believed to born into a social construct; this contract lays down multiple structures of living that unify the group. The structures built are: racial, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, religious. These structures are legal structures that appear to essentialize the human in these social groups to a rigid role; if one defies these laws that one must to adhere to to be a legal racial identity, or ethnic identity, then ostracism occurs; punitivity is seen as the correcting devise to keep one following the law of one's imposed identity. The construction aspect is a legal idea; it supposedly coheres individuals as one identity so nothing foreign can dismantle the group. It's as if individuals disappear, a mass just appears. Interestingly, social construction may be seen a product of biological determinism; the social identity is a fixed and innate identity one is born with; it's as if biology, chemistry, physics constructs these social groups; religion believes these identities are God given, morality believes these identity allow for mutual and fluid activity amongst each other without friction. This is the conservative position. Social construction is seen as a fluid, individual, purely as an experiential identity. It's as if these identities are not actually objective identifies from the 'real'; these identities stem from the ideal; the ideal changes due to experiences not biological mechanisms such as cells, hearts and lungs. This gives forth a plurality of interpretations of what one identity means not just having different identities. The individual is free to derive their identity from personal experience relative to others within group, but also relative to other social groups; intersectional identities can be formed where different social groups interact to form new experiences that enhance unity not break apart unity. Social construction is an extremely relative definition depending on whatever school of thought one adheres to. Objectivists will see sociy construction differently from the subjectivist, etc. Is social construction a social construction; depends on who you ask. It could be a synthesis of all perspectives. 

I agree with Michael that your quote sounds basically like a definition on Ayn Rand's part, so my counter-question is also, is there something more specific you have in mind? Anyways, since "The nature of nature is outside man's volition" I think I am right in assuming you would like to know more about the power of man, i.e. what is man able to do and what is outside of his potency. For example, I might assert that it is in my power (volition) to give a red rose on valentine's day to my partner or not (it is up to me to decide whether I want to or not), but it is not in my power to change the flow of water in a river (to make a bad but plastic example). Others might think that nothing is subject to man's will and that is actually nature that determines man. The question what "power" a man's volition has is generally referred to as the Free Will-debate. Which basically has many a different author contributing to it all positioning themselves on a dimension between hard-determinists (who believe that man has no power at all) and indeterminists (who believe that man has a Free Will and it is this will that makes the world go 'round) and yet others who position themselves in the middle and suppose that determinism and free will is actually compatible. For a very good overview of the historical and contemporary arguments concerning Free Will, I'd suggest you check out the entry on Stanford's Encyclopedia of Philosophy by Timothy O'Connor or The Oxford Handbook of Free Will by Robert Kane (2002 (1st ed.) and 2011 (2nd ed.)). I'd usually suggest the Wikipedia entry for Free Will, because it normally gives you a very good starting point of the general concepts. However, personally, I came to dislike it, because imho it is somehow biased. But since that is my personal opinion (and maybe word of advice for caution) I also suggest that: $URL$ 

I am planning on writing a paper on what Sellars calls "the paradox of man's encounter with himself" (Sellars Philosophy and the Scientific Image of Man 1962: 6). To quote Sellars in more detail: 

There was a moment in France, where all the philosopher tried to use some psychoanalysis in their works. Lacan was one of the really, most famous psychoanalyst, and was known to be really difficult to read. Actually, a lots of peoples start to speak like him, and a lot of philosophers were really influenced by this. One of the main point was to use a lot of references to science and a lot of analogies. I am trying to give you a decent, not opinion based answer but it's difficult. If the first comment talks about obscurantism it's not meaningless. Some people started to criticize the postmodern philosopher. Alan Sokal and Jean Bricmont published a book, "impostures intellectuelles" (intellectual imposture, or fashionable nonsense), which ... well the title says it all. They receive some supports. Michel Onfray also published some works against psychoanalysis, for reasons closely related to obscurantism. I have some doubts for some of this author. I don't think all of the work they have done is bad, or not interesting. For what I understand it was some sort of fashion, a way to act, to appear smart. Onfray : Twilight of an idol (Cr√©puscule d'une idole) Sokal Bricmont : Fashionable nonsense / Intellectual imposture (Impostures intellectuelles) I just found also that there is a wikipedia page on this topic : $URL$ Apparently Noam Chomsky is cited here. By the way I don't know if you read them in french or a translation, but even for french people it's really hard to read. 

I'm not sure about your definition of the theory of evolution. You can find plenty of them on internet, so I won't copy them here and try to give my feeling about it : Information about living entity are in the genome. The important thing is that gene can change, mutate, resulting in differences in some element of the species. If the mutation give an advantage to one individual, he is more likely to have children, and will give the new gene to them. After several generation these gene might become common, and share by a majority of the species, resulting in some evolution. But these process take a really long time. So in my opinion it doesn't mean nothing bad will ever happen to a species. Being able to feel some fear can help you to survive, and not be eaten by a predator. Still, to much fear can be bad for you. Some aggressiveness might help you to survive in a dangerous world. Also a individual that really want to have sex, even at the cost of raping other in the species have more probability to reproduce and have children. All these behavior might not be adapted now, but if some gene of aggressiveness are present in the population they can't disappear really fast. My explanation would be : mankind has redefined really fast the environment, faster than evolution could do. People with bad behavior due to gene can still reproduce and have children that will share these gene. Evolution doesn't guarantee that people will be good and nice to each other. It just selects individual able to survive and reproduce. Being a social animal goes further than that. We are able to make people survive even if they have small defects. Evolution is just a logical consequence of the diversity of gene and mutation.
