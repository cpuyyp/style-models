No they would not. Cavalry in the Civil War was very vulnerable to fire and was never able to attack formed infantry with success until armed with repeating rifles late in the war. Even then most of these attacks were performed dismounted, with only a small strike team charging mounted. There was actually an incident in the battle that shows what a debacle this could be. Elon Farnsworth was ordered to attack a skirmish line of Confederate Troops: (from WIKI) 

I've heard that the left hand rule is so that sword-bearing riders can engage each other, while the right hand rule is due to men driving large carts being able to use whips on their oxen without striking oncoming carts. Take that as you will. 

It is hard to tell since nobody aside from the Romans wrote...and Roman writers were rich city dwelling snobs who could hardly be bothered going to a distant province and writing down natural features there. There is some indirect evidence in the archaeologic record - Bronze Age settlers would sometimes add to or incorporate Mesolithic survivals into their monuments. Iron Age settlers would often build graveyards around Bronze Age barrows...but not inside. Similarly Anglo Saxon graves can often be found around or in Roman Ruins. So while we don't know what they thought exactly, it shows that these peoples took note of ancient remains and thought they were significant to them as well. 

The main genius Frederick had was remembering to snitch a province at the start of his wars to pay for the war and fill his army. This is how he got Silesia before the 7 Years war, and Saxony in it. He failed to hold on to Saxony. Aside from the signature wins at Rossbach, Freddy the G had just as much of an issue beating the Austrians. He was routed at Kolin and had to flee Bohemia, Torgau was a bloody affair, not a decisive one. We could go into more but he got his share of repulses and defeats from all sides but the French, who he only faced once. Both the Russians and the Austrians used entrenched, defensive positions against him, which he attacked. Both had decent troops. The major difference I think is that the Russians took so long to march to the theatre that the Prussians were weak from previous campaigning, and in a hurry to eject them and thus tended to attack with less caution. There could also be some prejudice there by Frederick himself. 

It hardly matters, since even if such a thing happened, Washington DC was crammed with troops and surrounded by forts, Grant had just taken Vicksburg and the entire army there and Rosecrans was driving Bragg into Georgia. So there would have been plenty of good news coming in, and no need to comply with such a letter. And the chance of a 'destroying the enemy army' battle in the US Civil War was effectively zero. Nobody achieved one, aside from Grant at Appomattox, and he didn't fight a battle there. Lee never came close to doing that with the Army of the Potomac, and there is nothing at Gettysburg that would help. If he won, the Union Army would fall back and regroup closer to Washington, and get some reinforcements, and Lee would eventually have to retire to Virgina. 

The terms of the Augustan Settlement of 27 BC, where Augustus and the Senate defined respective powers, set a delay of five years from Consulship to receiving a Senatorial Province, so at least half of this gap was by law. The Senatorial provinces were, as a rule, staid and peaceful provinces as well, and had little or no military forces. The point underlying all of this was to put an end to the Republican mode of using provincial wealth and provincial armies as a lever to contend for ultimate power. An up-and-coming Consul who fancied himself in opposition to Augustus or the Emperor would wait years to see even the most boring province, if any. If you played ball, though, a talented fellow might get appointed by Augustus to a nice command with some legions. So the mode under the Principate was to encourage the leading lights of the Senate to work within the system rather than plot how to overturn it. An additional wrinkle is that while all Senatorial provinces were ruled by a man named Proconsul, a majority of these officials were of Praetorian rank and served for several years in a row. So the pool for a job after becoming Consul was considerably reduced. 

It was the largest and most important in that war, so the general term attached itself to the specific day. This kind of thing happens all the time, like all tissues being called Kleenex or all bleaches Chlorox. 

The first country with a separation of the Christian church from the state was the Roman Empire. First, trivially, before Constantine the Church was persecuted by the government and was entirely separate. After that, there were incidents that showed the Church could claim power above the government. Consider Bishop Ambrose of Milan in the late 4th Century: 

He didn't know anything of the sort. He had to make a calculation based on the facts. Naval mines, then called torpedoes, were dangerous but unreliable, especially the Confederate ones. Although he had just seen the Tecumseh go down, showing that at least one mine was functional, he also knew that the confusion in the line of ships because of the sinking led to his unarmored ships being stationary under fire of the forts. Staying put would mean that ships and men would be lost to gunfire from the forts. Believing action better than inaction, he risked the torpedoes and losing additional ships to gain entrance into the bay and thus shutting down the port. As it turned out, no other ships were lost although there were reports of sailors hearing the snap of the firing mechanisms. Once the fleet was inside, the port was lost - unless the Rebel ironclad could defeated his entire fleet. It failed to do this, and soon landings behind the forts led to their evacuation, thus closing down the last Gulf port. 

Joe Johnston is one of the intriguing generals in the ACW but his record is mixed to say the least. And I say that as someone who likes the man. His abilities to plan were somewhat lacking. He came within an ace of being cut off from Atlanta in the opening stages when McPherson pulled back from Resaca into Snake Creek Gap, allowing the Rebs to pull back from Dalton. His attempts to hit back while retiring were deflected by none other than Hood himself at Cassville. Hood was also intriguing against Joe and with second in command Hardee with Richmond. Davis, who never had a lot of confidence in him, let this backbiting continue. Also, Braxton Bragg, who Johnston replaced, was there putting his own spin on matters. The 'draw them into the interior' strategy ran into a big problem when Sherman mobilized the North's transportation might to keep the army running at the end of this tether with relative ease. When the offensive didn't just collapse, Johnston didn't seem to have a real plan to offer - he did at times beg for Forrest or someone to try and cut the rail lines, but if this were his plan he should have made this clear to Richmond at the start. His silence to Davis on strategies, if he had one, did him no favors. The final blow to his prestige was the retirement to the Chattahoochee. He had just days before claimed he could hold north of the river for months. Instead in a matter of days the US was over the river in force and still he seemed to have no plan. The closest he ever said at the time was intending for militia to hold the city to allow 'freer and wider' movements. If he was thinking of attacking at this point, he really needed to say so, and then do it. Davis pulling JoeJ was a bad decision, but more because it was too late. If you really are going to undercut your general the way Davis did, you might as well ditch him from the start. Hood was a sneak, and deserved to get the mess dumped in his lap at the worst time just for justice's sake, but for the CSA it was a no-win situation. It was extremely difficult to physically force an army back by frontal attacks, or even flank ones by 1864. Once the US got that close, the fall of the city was eventually going to happen barring massive reinforcements. 

Confederate resupply capability at Gettysburg was virtually nil. The North even had units near Frederick and Harper's Ferry on the line of communication. These were no match for the army, but could interdict a wagon train. So a indefinite stalemate at Gettysburg would have required a Confederate retreat. At the end of the battle, there was still ample food, and small arms (rifle) ammunition for more fighting. Artillery solid shot was virtually out in the 1st and 3rd Corps batteries that bombarded the Union position, so they could not have repeated that. They had ample canister which would come into play if the Union attacked their position in turn. With the army concentrated, foraging for food was limited, and the ammo would not last forever, but there was some left, especially for defense. But Lee would have to retire towards the Potomac absent a crushing victory for resupply sooner rather than later. 

The main reason the demands were unreasonable is that A-H wanted to force the issue with Serbia in order to end the troubles with their disaffected minorities in the neighboring districts. Getting an 'attaboy' support blank check from Germany helped stoke the fire. Serbia actually accepted virtually all the unreasonable demands, if not all of them. But since the ultimatum was basically a pretext, A-H went to war anyway. To their embarrassment, they found that they had no way of actually attacking Serbia right off, as their army was in other locations and being moved toward Russia. By the time they got that straightened out and invaded, the Serbs gave them a bloody nose. Here's the ultimatum - and response The insolence is partly just claiming that the Serbian government was guilty of spreading anti AH propaganda. The demands include: 

From the US Census, 1920 was the first census where more than half the population was considered Urban rather than Rural. This might be considered a rough answer to your question. Source 

So 18-36 rounds (if they had 2). The US Civil War cartridge box capacity was 40 rounds, as this was a Corps Symbol for one of the Western Armies. 

The Emperor of Rome at the time was all powerful in the secular field but was reduced to submission in this instance by the Bishop. This did not happen in every instance, most Bishops were not as firm as Ambrose but it did set a precedent for the later Popes to use. 

Well the famous "scrap of paper" Treaty that Great Britain had with Belgium that brought them into WWI assured the independence and neutrality of Belgium and Luxembourg against all comers. 

Any answer is going to be speculative, but a 'learning siege warfare by contact' explanation begs the question of why Germans and Goths, living on the edge of Rome for centuries did not do the same thing. A difference between the Goths and the Hunnic Empire that might explain the result is that Gothic tribes were ethnic units while the Huns added whole peoples (including Goths) to their empire en-masse and gave individuals a real ability to integrate into the decision making ranks of the Huns. There is a description from an envoy to the Huns of meeting a ex-Roman who was now a mid-range chief. The difference might be the richer rewards for those who could do that job available as an energetic siege-man in the Huns.
