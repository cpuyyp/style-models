People have just enough hope that they can advance through some sort of system of of this squalor, be it education or hard work. A lot of slave societies (like Rome or Caribbean plantation colonies) had some way for slaves to earn their freedom and that helped to keep the 'unpleasantness' of daily life from becoming mutinous feelings. The main problem here is that you are not dealing with overworked people, but people who cannot find employment, and they are in a different mindset. People can't leave, which could be caused by the government preventing them from leaving or spreading misinformation about the 'greener pastures', so that people don't want to go back. The main issue here is why would the government want to keep people at the city, since they seemingly don't need them? Maybe there is something more sinister going on, like a social grand experiment or something along those lines. The problem with that is that it will move the focus of your story away from your protagonist and on to solving the 'mystery', which sounds like it wouldn't serve your story well. 

The first thing governments would start doing will likely be to institute laws that make it illegal to have children without a government license, and make those licenses very hard to get. This in order to prevent population growth from going out of control. Of course in reality (see China's 1 child policy) it will not be perfect by far, and populations will still rise, both from people breaking the law and governments handing out more licenses than needed to balance out people getting killed anyway (say from serious accidents, it's unlikely people would become immortal to the extend that they'd survive beheading or getting burned in a lake of lava). Another measure governments might take is prescribing forced sterilisation of the entire fertile population, with those deemed "valuable to society" getting to donate sperm or ovas for in vitro fertilisation at the government's discretion. Combine this with mandatory euthenasia for people over a set age (which would likely be the age at which people stop being tax paying workers, so retirement age), and you have a system where now the government has perfect control over who lives and dies, who gets born and who doesn't. Government and religion both will have the same goal: getting people to willingly submit to this new and brutal regime. People being forced to let themselves be killed at an early age when they're still healthy need some other motivation than "if you don't let us kill you we're going to kill you anyway", so it will be presented as a religious duty to "make room for a new generation" or however it's worded. Welcome to a Brave New World, where The Fifty makes sure only young and healthy people exist who do not leech the precious resources of your labour... 

These examples are fairly extreme and probably wouldn't be frequent in the universe but I'm interested in the physics of nanobot consumption. Say a particular species of nanobot is developed. How would it 'consume' objects and what would it do with the matter after if consumed it? I'm interested specifically in the functionality of the nanobot and any side affects that functionality might have. An example of a silly non-realistic answer might be: It uses a little pacman mouth to devour atoms.... 

All of this can achieved with very little memory. Processor I don't know a lot about processors, but these calculations use very small volumes of data. My calculator lags when I press the button and we don't want that, so something in the range of 100+Mhz would probably be okay. Answer This all assumes that the calculations are this simple, I've literally stripped the system to its bare minimum. You could say that a few Mb of RAM would be enough for a simple purpose computer and a processor that runs at about 1Ghz. This would not be fast by our current day standards as my phone has 1Gb of RAM and 2.4Ghz clock rate for its processor. Adding more processing would allow for better gravitational calculations and collision prediction. 

I don't have that much experience in world building, but one thing I always try to keep in mind is: Why am I creating this world? What do I need it for? If you are just creating a world in your spare time, as a mental exercise, go right ahead and ignore this. If you, on the other hand need it for, say, an RPG or a book, make sure you understand what that product is going to need from your world. One example would be a short story. Since you are trying to tell a story and creating a new world for that purpose, there have to be something that sets it apart from the real world. In that case, I would try and figure out that 'otherness' and identify what you need to get there: Maybe the atmosphere is different or social structures developed in a different way? I hope this helps you. 

I love developing complex languages for stories and worlds, I'm not much of a language expert though and on top of this I struggle to store all the necessary information to help me work with the language. It's difficult to find words that you've previously defined or to create language structure without a good organisation system. Does anyone know of any tools that can be used to aid with recording your own language? Is it as simple as a good spreadsheet or are there more suitable methods? 

Look ahead some amount and predict a crash Try a move and see where it takes the ship If that's no good try another maybe in the other direction Try and correct movement towards some target vector if the ship has a destination 

[This just includes motion stuff, I'd expect door, lights, air locks, life support etc to all be simply plugged into some power supply and left to run, turned on and off light light switches.] We need to be able to control these and make calculations about how to move the ship. So we need to know a few things: 

It's happened in the past, and can happen again. Years ago the Dutch government passed a new law literally overnight that was introduced around dinner time one day and came into effect around breakfast the next. Now, that was merely a budget bill allowing the purchase of some military equipment before treaty obligations would kick in and cause serious penalties. But if can indeed happen. And as most people don't read the official government channels for publication of new laws, and most newspapers and other news outlets will be hours behind in publishing things, most people won't know the law is passed until probably the evening news. Of course a major problem is organising your enforcement effort very rapidly in between passing the law and enforcement coming into effect a few hours later. 

It would cause the price of gold to crash, making your pile of gold essentially worthless. Others would gobble it up and then slowly filter it back into the market as the gold price stabilises, making a killing. Which is what you should have done yourself in the first place of course... This isn't limited to gold, it goes for any commodity. The question is discussed in some detail in discussions about the viability of asteroid mining, where it is sometimes suggested that the haul in precious metals from a single large asteroid would quickly be able to pay for the cost of the entire operation by just dumping it on the market. For all the reasons already mentioned, that's not how it works. You'd rather have to release those tons of rare materials (platinum for example) in small batches, say a few percent of the yearly demand, unless maybe you were to at the same time introduce a new and highly lucrative use for those materials, which would increase demand to the point where a high market price can be sustained despite a greatly increased supply. 

These need to be pretty damn precise so lets make them big numbers and say that we need 160 bytes for these! So we're left with 714 bytes to play with. Now we need to do some maths. Assuming the ship knows its own mass it probably only needs to do $F = ma$ and $F = G({m_1 m_2}/{r^2})$ a lot to avoid an object. It might also want to then store a few values about its positions after a move its going to make, validate whether or not that leads to crashing into another different object and try again. So we can add another 100 position values or 150 bytes bring us to, 564 bytes left. These remaining 500ish bytes of RAM must simply contain some basic logic about the process I described above. 

The Humble Hamster (Without genetic engineering) Seriously, how fun would it be to have lots of little hamsters rolling around the generation ship in space age hamster balls? This would be even more awesome in a 0g environment! They could have specially designed 0g hamster balls and tunnel mazes to play in. They're small and don't require a lot of food, the food they do require is easy to produce. They don't produce a lot of waste and they're great fun for kids. Only issue is that you might lose them (hamsters are great at escaping) and you will need a significant population to keep them going as they only live for a few years. But I think the super fun benefits out-weight the problems. 

This is a very interesting question. I would probably draw inspiration from the difference between the armies of the early Roman republic and the ones created by the Marian Reforms, which changed the army from a citizen levy to the professional legions we know today. There was a lot of factors behind the changes, but a few absolutely key factors were the centralization of almost all arable land in the hands of very few people, and the introduction of massive amounts of slave labor. Earlier, the Romans used property requirements, including how much land you owned, to determine who could provide what equipment. Once almost all land was held by the elite, and slaves, captured in military campaigns, could work the land for free, it induced both a manpower shortage in the old system (since fewer people had the necessary wealth to equip themselves) and a manpower abundance for the new system (a LOT of very poor and very desperate citizens). I would make your Counts, Dukes etc. a very wealthy elite and the only land owners. There need to be some reason why farming does not occupy a majority of the potential population (could be slaves, magic or some kind of technology) and a reason for the poor to see military service as the best way out of their misery. They might be forced to fight, but then it more like a slave army, which I would not consider within the parameters given. I would also suggest coming up with a good reason why armies need to be kept standing. Maybe there are a lot of surprise attacks or maybe the armies are need to keep the peace. I did consider a few other alternatives: Maybe the soldiers have some special quality that are hard to identify and lost if not used regularly or maybe the food production is so poor that even fighting medium scale military campaigns can devastate both the attacker and defenders manpower and so engagements are only fought between small groups of skilled fighters to not waste precious life. 

How primitive do you need to go? If you need to go back to a pre-spaceflight society, you'd need to eliminate all spaceflight. Which would for most people on the planet mean no more GPS navigation or foreign television and that's about it. If you need to go back to a pre-electrical society, you'd need to start killing most of the urban and suburban population as without electricity there'd be no way for cities the size we have now. This gets worse if you need to go so far as to eliminate internal combustion engines. If you have time, this could possibly be achieved by a temporary ban put in place on having children. By enforcing this only on urbanites and strictly enforcing a ban on more than 2 children on farmers, urban populations would dwindle. Go back to a pre-metal society and you'd have to effectively reduce the number of people to a stone age society level of a few tens of millions of people worldwide at most (down from a current level of between 7 and 8 billion). Pretty much the only way to achieve that is through "active measures", probably a virulent biological or chemical weapon that rapidly kills the entire population, except a few choice individuals who happen to be immune. And you'd be no different from the others whp're intent to kill all technological civilisations... So everything depends on how primitive you need to go. 

I've been thinking about a cyberpunk universe where nanobots are a universal force capable of achieving many things, examples include: 

Note: I haven't included communication with other humans in my answer, I'm assuming the ship being at the Oort cloud cannot communicate with other ships. Context It's possible for the human brain to solve these problems quite easily, as can be seen by playing Kerbal Space Program and the Apollo moon landing was achieved with roughly the computation power of a calculator. Scanning The question is, what does the computer need to know. Assuming it has a radar that can output 3D vectors of solid objects you then to store these vectors. You need to decide some resolution and range for the radar. The distance to the moon is 384,000km so we'll make sure the range is big enough to encompass that, let's say 400,000km. (I'm making the assumption here that you don't want your radar to be able to track as far as the Oort cloud, you just want to be able to process reactions to collisions.) We'll want to be able to pick up fairly small objects on this radar and avoid them so we can split that into units, being practical the 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko comet we just landed on is about 4km accross, so we'll want to pick up on that. That means at maximum that we have 100,000^3 units of scanning data to store. Assuming the positions are measured as integers that's 1.2x10^16 bits of data, or 1.5x10^15 bytes (That's 1500 Terrabytes!) if the entire field of view is covered in matter. The ship is probably not going to be surrounded by objects so we can give it some kind of buffer and say that it can store maybe 100 points, which is of course a lot less, about 150 bytes. Which is really easy to handle. Control That's just for the scanning data. My calculator can only store about 70 numbers which means it probably can't do what you want. Lets assume a minimal computer with 1Kb of RAM which is 1024 bytes. That's a bit more than we need so it leaves us with a healthy 874 bytes to play with. What do we need to do with this? Here you need to consider the structure of the ship. I'm going to go with the simplest possible configuration (based on Kerbal Space Program missions):
