No punishment, only "Reconditioning" If punishing a criminal doesn't work, why not try to fix the behavior? If you have nearly immortal people, counselors could be assigned to work with these criminals who will have all the time they need to work on someones misbehavior. Classes will be provided, and a person cannot get out of internment until their assigned counselor deems them "Corrected". (Now I realize that this sounds super "police state" and shady, but any utopia society always get's a bit juicier with a bit of dystopia sprinkled on top) Mind you these counselors and their staff would likely have monumental work loads, but hey, they're immortal, they'll get around to it! Say a person got caught littering - Now they need to go through classes and programs about environmental effects until a counselor signs off that they think the person is unlikely to do that again. If needed, that litterbug will come out of the program a fully certified environmental engineer. Say someone commits murder - LOTS of work to be done; If they have any addictions, they don't get out until their clean. If they are violent, they work with psychologists until their outlook on life is adjusted. Basically since we have an infinite amount of time to work with here, maybe your people could adopt the policy of "anything and anyone can be fixed given enough time". 

Assuming a world where starships don't use missiles and bullets in combat much. They only carry those as a final strike or for convenience. Their arsenal is almost entirely composed of electricity-based weaponry and tools: Arc generators to scar opponent ships with lightning bolts, field generators to deflect and reallocate incoming discharges and objects, voltage adjustment, gas emitters to produce plasma blobs, the works. This could invalidate certain tactics - small craft might be too easy to destroy because once they enter the range of a large cruiser, they don't even have to be targeted - they're just struck by a discharge due to voltage difference. They can try to match surface potential, but the cruiser is already varying its own based on some unpredictable sequence, making it unfeasible. Missiles suffer the same fate, so they're out of the question. Assuming power isn't hard to carry, how would this arsenal further change known tactics that are used in naval and air battles? Could it possibly invalidate certain kinds of corps and produce new ones? Specifics on the technology available: 

Maelstroms are ginormous whirlpools. They can exist continuously in an area. They're cool. The question is, how large can they get? As large as an island? Could a maelstrom have a diameter of or ? If so, could they be formed or maintained by natural causes and structures so that one could encircle an island constantly (as big as Jamaica for example)? As in, having an effective source beneath the island? (I know islands don't have sea under them, I'm talking about the effective center of the whirlpool) What about a group of islands, where a massive maelstrom has a source between them? Could the tides encircle an island group (like the Seychelles in size)? I'm asking if such a thing could exist with contrived (if necessary) but natural causes. 

Magic is all about patterns. You chant a spell, you wave a wand, you throw eye of newt, and poof! You have to do all three things together, one or two won't work. The magician is looking for correspondences. "As above, so below" was the basis of astrology, but it led to astronomy. Alchemy was magic, but it led to chemistry. According to our science, then, magic is looking in the right places but asking the wrong questions. In your world, however, magic works. The magician understands that patterns have power, even if there's no logical explanation. The scientist understands that, if it works, there's logic in there somewhere, it's just that nobody's found it yet. The scientist can analyze the spell, the wand, and the eye but not understand the gestalt that happens by combining them. By seeing it work, though, you can work backwards from what you do understand. To put it another way, lightning is like magic. It happens, we see it, but until recently we didn't know what it was or why it happened. With science you can ask the right questions, play around with things, and discover how to generate your own lightning in a bottle. We might not have electricity without the idea of lightning to guide us. Science is supremely rational. Magic is supremely irrational. They have to work in the same universe. They operate on the same fundamental forces, so they have common ground somewhere, they're just coming at it from different directions. Perhaps there is something like quantum physics, a more sophisticated model of the universe, that would make sense to both sides once they worked it out. 

Now how long can we expect a car to work until it breaks down? Lets assume cars last for miles on average (half of what they're expected to if maintenance is available[11]) and they're already half-way there, so about miles left on each car on average. Based on the average daily consumption of gasoline and the average fuel efficiency[7] we get about miles per day which is very low, so lets assume a highest bound of miles per day. That gives us about days average life for each car, a bit over a year. If the average usage is half that much, we get days, which is a bit over 2 years. Obviously, people skilled with car maintenance, with available parts or scrap to turn into parts and a bit of creativity will get them working for longer, but I doubt you'll get cars older than 5-6 years still in working condition. Of course, that's speculation. So I'd say, as a rule of thumb, halve the amount of working cars every 2 years after the apocalypse. After a decade, you're left with about cars in the US, most of them hosts to parts of their fallen brethren. In 20 years, you have about a thousand cars left. This further removes fuel as an issue - it will never run out by car usage alone, but the cars will run out pretty soon. 

Absolutely possible 1 kg of plastic explosive ^ That is 1 kg of plastic explosive going off, which i'm sure that even 0.5 kg of that, would be more than enough for a very messy and sudden death. As far as transmitter/gps/microphone equipment goes, we have smartphones that weight only 100g: lightest phone So yap, these are not only possible, you wouldn't even need to be tony stark to build one. 

If you're looking for a more fantasy like answer, perhaps evolution has driven the two predators into a cooperative pact of some sort. Say for example if the primary grazer of the area has, over the millennia, developed an exceptionally thick hide. The primary predators of this animal have included two species with very different methods of bringing it down. One, essentially a large predatory cat, would bring it down through mauling the prey and get the kill through sheer violence. The other, a large venomous lizard, would simply bite the prey in the leg, inject a lethal dose of venom, then just follow the beast until it fell. Nowadays, with the grazer's hide being so thick, the cats take much much longer to take it down by themselves and the risk of getting bucked in the head or grievously wounded has become too high. The lizard too has problems, in that it's fangs has difficulties penetrating the thick outer layer to deliver it's venom. The solution: These predators hunt in pairs. Now earning dinner is a co-op game. The cat will typically make the first strike, focusing on opening up a gash somewhere in the targets hide. The moment the lizard senses an open wound, it will pounce in and inject it's venom. Once this is done, both predators retreat to a safe distance and wait for their meal. I don't have too hard of a time imagining a pact like this actually forming through natural evolution, and it could make for a fairly unique bond between the two creatures. Each one may even develop a tendency to try to form a lifetime partnership with the other. 

The reason for heads is to give the eyes a swiveling perch at the top. If you put the eyes on stalks, you could get away with putting nose, mouth, etc., in the torso. If the setting is a "new world" of some kind, you might include an assortment of other creatures with the same configuration, to explain how they evolved. 

Can we agree, as SF writers, to stop extrapolating this way? What possible reason is there to think that, during the centuries we develop FTL cruise ships, we won't make a single breakthrough in computer technology? Unless your ships run on diesel engines, your computers shouldn't use today's ideas either. We already have some of the equipment and techniques we need to make quantum computers. Do some research. Design a computer that fits into your setting. If it's necessary to your plot for a stasis pod to fail, find a convincing way to make it fail in context. Somebody sabotaged it. An employee at the factory got fired while assembling it and "lost" a wrench. One of the kids pressed a few buttons and accidentally started the self-destruct sequence. During the ejection process, one corner nicked a loose girder, so the stasis field didn't enclose the pod completely. A reader who doesn't understand how computers work won't understand how a CPU overload affects an escape capsule. 

I don't mean to disappoint you but planets are already charged - all bodies in space have a voltage that depends on their immediate environment to the degree that they interact with it through the interplanetary medium, which transfers charge to an extent. Being isolated most of the time, they develop a potential compared to other objects due to the balances within their immediate environment being satisfied but by not having contact with other objects, their relative potential doesn't balance because their charges don't interact. This is why in electronics and electrical engineering, two points cannot be compared in terms of their voltage, unless they share a point, usually ground. An example would be two batteries - while the voltage between their ends can be approximately the same (lets say 5V), if they're isolated from each other completely and you place a wire near them with a high enough voltage to overcome air resistance (say, 50 kV), against one there might be a spark, but not against the other, at the same distance (provided you kept the wire at a constant voltage). While this is unlikely to happen in the same room, due to the air balancing out charges through interaction and friction, it is possible to observe this difference experimentally. The ground in England is not the same ground as in Italy - but the voltage between the ends of batteries will be. In much the same way, if two celestial objects where to pass close enough to each other to interact electrically, there would be huge lightning bolts. You don't see this often with asteroids because they don't often pass close enough to other objects and because given enough time in the same environment, their effective potential balances out. But to answer the question, a planet can and does have a net charge - it's not something exotic, it would be exotic if it didn't.
