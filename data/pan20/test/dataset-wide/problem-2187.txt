Before I could talk to my boss, first thing in the morning, Bob, my manager, Joe, and my boss held a meeting. Later, from what Joe told me(the tech lead that has my back), my Boss Derek mentioned that the lack of communication is causing the failure of the project (our project is now 3 weeks late, so we likely have lots to explain to our client). Apparently, even in this meeting with everyone in it, Bob was showing resistance and defensiveness. I was then invited to the meeting - Bob wasn't in this one. My boss asked me what I have done in the project and what I still need to do. I told him what I did and what I still need to do. Derek was understandably concerned about my progress since we're in crunch time with the state of the project, and I couldn't get some things done without some obvious guidance since it involved the scope of the project and involvement of other people's code that I do not have an awareness of (since no one communicated with me despite me asking). He told me I need to get my things done ASAP and to talk to Joe about my issues (something that brightened me up). From what I understood of what he told me, Joe picked up the project management aspect and I am to talk to him about any issues, which I did. It was incredible the difference in the communication between me and Joe. He really understood what I was going through, and stood up for me the entire time even against my "manager", who seems to be taking the side of Bob, for whatever reason. My manager, Joe, and I ate lunch together, and Joe said to my manager, while in front of me, that "when you see behavior like Bob's verbal abuse to other developers and people, you HAVE to let him know that this behavior is unnacceptable and must be stopped." My manager, for some reason, seems to still be taking the side of Bob, and said that Bob gets stuff done, even though sometimes he is reluctant and has an attitude. For one thing, I know I cannot trust my manager to stand up for himself, let alone me. Joe later told me that in China, it can be common that decent developers are like this, since good talent is so hard to find, and that most decent developers want to work for large and established companies, and not for small-to-medium sized ones. The point said by one of the people that posted an answer about the cultural differences is quite true. Later, I talked to Joe about needing help with one of the final APIs I needed to do. For the first time since joining this company, someone patiently listened and gave me advice on how to approach the issue, something I never received either from my manager let alone Bob. Joe simply gave me the feeling that someone has my back, and that it's not simply me against everyone else, let alone me being part of a team. The difference is astounding. I usually meet with Bob at 6:30 every night to talk about the things I've done. The difference, again, talking to Bob, versus talking to Joe, was astounding. Bob, again, was cold and non-understanding. He was visibly a little ticked off that I was talking to Joe about our project, and asked me why I even needed to talk to him. Bob simply did not or chose not to understand that communication is important, despite what happened today, and seemingly our boss having a chat with him. He said "I'm really not happy that you're talking to Joe about these things, since he doesn't understand our project." It was as if Bob's control of me was slowly fading, and he was desperately trying to regain control of me. It was a very weird and dreadful feeling talking to Bob. I don't know Bob outside of work, or whether he's normally like this (since we're in a deadline), but how he is working under pressure and in response dealing with people, is seriously a little messed up. After work, I thanked Joe for caring about me - not just using words to care, but showing it through action by standing up for me and more. I told him, "generally working in China, no one really cares about each other, but you proved to me that's not true." He replied "whatever you do, always come back. Never forgeit that. Also, if that's what you believe (in reference to what I said about working in CHina), will become true. We shape our reality; we don't just live in it." Despite all this happening, I still have sympathy for Bob. With another intern leaving just a week ago, and him and I being the only software developers left for the web portion of the project, he is responsible for the majority of what's still left to be done. Does that make his behavior acceptable? No, I do not think so. I do think, however, that he's not in a very good position himself either. I hope we can end this peacefully and effectively; my boss wants to chat with me tomorrow again about working together cohesively with Bob and Joe to get this project done. I plan to be honest with my boss about what's happened so far with me in the project and with Bob, and ask him how I can effectively communicate with Bob so we can work together to get this project completed. 

Try as much as possible to act as an enabler for your team to produce high quality code. They will appreciate the respect this entails 

"Nominated for a promotion" isn't worth the breath it takes to say it. Ok - sure - it's a nice thing to be told, but if you're taking a hard-headed look at your business relationship with your employer it means almost nothing. Even more seriously "resistance from HR given some circumstances we can't control" translates directly to "I want to appear nice, and have you stay even though you should be promoted, so I'll blame some mysterious thing over at HR". Take the interview - give it your best. You're not wasting their time, you are giving them the opportunity to recruit you. You haven't decided yet whether to stay or go. You never know, once you look more closely, the other job might be more attractive than getting the promotion would be. 

Electronically Network Utilize your network. Do you have any former classmates from college or former colleagues that have moved on to some of these "bigger and better" markets that you'd like to enter? If you worked with them on class projects so they know you were a hard-worker and smart, that always is a bonus. Give them a call or email, reconnect with them on facebook or linked in, etc. Ask them about where they're working now, what kinds of skills their employer is looking for, how they'd recommend getting your feet in the door, what kinds of projects they're working on, etc. At some point, you may even wish to ask if they'd be able to give you a tour of their office or if you could take them out to lunch the next time you're in town visiting. Take A Vacation and Network in Person If at all possible, take a "vacation" to one or more of your target markets. If you can coincide your visit with a professional group event where you'd have networking opportunities, all the better. Set up some lunch dates with people you know or have networked with to learn more about where they work. You may even want to stop by and visit the companies you are most interested in, in person, to get a better sense of their culture. Strike up conversations with strangers, you'll never know when you happen to talk to someone that happens to be married to a hiring manager at one of your target companies (yes, that happened to me once, it does happen!) or have some other useful connection. Let people know you're just checking out the area as you're thinking of relocating there. Strategically Decide Where to Apply Some companies, especially smaller companies, may not have a budget available for flying out candidates from all parts of the country for an interview, let alone paying for relocation expenses, and they can't be sure you'll like the climate, traffic, etc, so there's slightly more risk involved in interviewing a non-local candidate. Consider: Are you willing to front any of those costs yourself? Or do you only want to consider companies that will pay for your out of town interview or relocation expenses? If you can find out beforehand what attitude the company has about relocation, it may be a non-issue, or you may need to specifically address in your cover letter why you're applying despite their "local candidates only" blurb on the job description. It's not you, there's just too many awesome candidates Java and .Net developers are pretty much both a dime a dozen in hot markets, and I know nothing of new york, but in the bay area it's a down economy right now and there's just a lot more people looking for jobs than there are jobs available. Somehow you have to differentiate yourself from all these other people who would probably also be fantastic candidates (many of whom may be local too) that you're competing against. Leverage what you have, and market yourself well--why should they hire you over all those other guys? I'm sure there is a reason, it's just pinpointing what makes you shine so you can sell yourself well. Take a Short-term Contract Another option to consider is applying for shorter term contract-positions in your target market. They may not pay relocation, and they offer less long-term stability, so you may just end up putting most of your stuff in storage for a while until you decide whether you're staying there for good, but that might be the foot in the door you need to make networking in person in your target market affordable and give you time to make good contacts who can hook you up with an interview for permanent positions at other companies. And if you're really lucky, perhaps you'll land a contract-to-hire gig. 

It may be that he really doesn't have the cash to pay you what he owes, and would have a hard time raising it. If this is true, you could perhaps come to a deal about an alternative form of recompense. For example, if he is genuine, and acknowledges the debt, one way out of the problem would be to offer you shares in the company instead. Of course, any entrepreneur will see the equity in their company as the way they are building up their future, and therefore valuable, and on the other hand, the shares might well be worthless - that's a judgement you'd have to make. Mostly, my point is that there are other ways than cash to settle a debt. If he isn't willing to at least consider alternatives, then it really brings the friendship into doubt. If you're genuinely looking for a solution that works for both of you, he must do the same, or he is not your friend. 

The answer is not entirely clear-cut. If you have an interviewer that happens to enjoy one of those same hobbies, that commonality may work to your advantage and make it easier to connect to your interviewer and leave a positive impression that you'd be a fun coworker to have on their team. Or even if they don't share those hobbies, they may see positive personality traits in those skills: you have a well-rounded life (helps prevent burnout) or generosity, interest in staying fit (good for health insurance costs), or leadership skills and so forth. But on the other hand, if the interviewer happens to be of a different political viewpoint, different religion, on a different side of any hot-button issue that you mention, thinks your hobby is too dangerous (risk for healthcare costs?), or the like, including such a hobby may actually work against you. And some interviewers will prefer to only focus on the office side of your resume, and find hobbies irrelevant. So if this portion of your resume is small and not controversial, it could be seen in a positive or neutral light, but there is risk to including a hobby section if which hobbies to list are poorly chosen. 

Put it to your team that some coding standards are needed. You can probably find some guidelines online to use as a starting point. Ask your team to give feedback on this, and allow them to add practices that they know to be good from their own experience. Set up a meeting to go through your draft guidelines and finalise it. There will certainly be some things that are controversial, and you'll need to allow sufficient discussion, but then close down on a decision. Even if a decision goes against something that one of the devs holds dear, they'll have the consolation that they were consulted and that a rational discussion took place. Get the team to do code reviews. Ideally this is not a hierarchical thing, but one team member helping the other to stick to the standards, and maybe making suggestions for design improvements. You can also consider pair programming, but many teams do fine without it. 

I talked to him privately. I told him "Hey Bob. Thanks for taking the time to mentor me on programming, but I'm a sensitive guy. When you call me "useless" or "don't know how to do anything", it makes me feel pretty bad about myself." He replied, “oh.. you shouldn’t have told me this,” and smiled. He told me he is this way because he wants me to be a good developer. I understand that challenging me technically as making me a good developer (which I agree, and I am not complaining about taking on technical challenges) but I do not see how giving me verbal abuse is "making me a better developer." Two days after privately talking to him about the effects of his verbal abuse, the mocking comments came back, with greater severity. Asking Bob (let's call him Bob) the question about having issues understanding the structure of the SQL database, he asked me “what school did you go to?” I told him “someUniversity, which is the same school as Derek (our boss).” He replied by saying “oh, Derek said, this new guy we’re hiring is from my school and he’s really good!”, and then staring at my manager followed by me “now look at this,” in a mocking and patronizing tone. This comment actually made me angry, but I didn’t say anything or showed that I was. I don’t often ask him questions, but when I do, I try to present to him my research and what I’ve done. I would present the question like this: “hey Bob. I am having issues with X. Here’s what I know about X so far..” He would interject by saying “you don’t know anything.” Asking Bob questions has always been an uphill battle always followed by verbal abuse. Knowing this, I stay under his radar by only asking him questions when I know he is the only one that knows this domain of knowledge. I brave the verbal abuse to get the information I need, but even at those times, his answers are brief and vague. When you ask a question to clarify his explanation, you are met with condescension and utter disbelief that I am unable to at first understand what he is saying or want clarification. He is never at fault even though his replies are often vague; it's always the recipient who is the "idiot" for not understanding what he is trying to say. His verbal abuse is not unique to me; it is to everyone on the team (at times even to the boss). He frequently calls other developers of the team “useless”, though I seem to get the blunt of the verbal abuse since I work directly with him and literally next to him. When once asked by our manager to do something, he replied “my time is important. Why don’t you ask the useless developers over there to do it instead?” I would sometimes try to start a conversation with him (which I've stopped) to get his casual opinion on technology and programming. He would see these questions as my ignorance to the topic, and would immediately dismiss them. I got close with another technical PM (his name is Joe), he told me that he understands working with Bob is very difficult. In a meeting between Bob, Joe, and Derek, when Joe tried to present a solution to an issue, Bob got emotionally defensive for something. Our boss Derek had to mediate and say "Hey Bob. Chill out. We're here to help." 

On the one hand, waiting till your alma matter acquaintance suggests the idea, might lead to it never happening. On the other, being pushy and putting him or her in an awkward situation gets you no further. Having previously been in the awkward position of having a few multiple former classmates, not all of whom were all-star performers, persistently ask me to forward their resume to my boss, I would hesitate. You might want to ask your contact whether s/he thinks you'd be a good fit for her company. If she has any reservations, ask lots of questions, and give him/her some ammo to sell him/her on the fit being good. Do all of that before suggesting s/he approach his/her boss, so you get a glowing recommendation rather than "apologies in advance boss, another classmate asked me to forward you their resume, I don't even know this guy!". Even if she tries to be polite, if she's curt and enthused in her language on one forwarded resume, and glowing in another, the boss may realize this was sent "just as a favor" and not follow up. Your acquaintance certainly doesn't want to risk tarnishing her reputation by endorsing an unknown quantity that turns out to be a bad hire, so make sure s/he has gotten to know enough about you to feel confident recommending you. You could broach the topic by asking whether s/he gets people asking to forward their resumes all the time? Is that super-awkward? "well, then I probably shouldn't ask, should I?" ;-). Ask her/him whether it's better to apply through internal channels (like forwarding her resume) or through the formal channels (it depends on the company!). Give her an easy out if she's really uncomfortable with the idea of forwarding your resume, but at some point, if you don't ask you will not receive. Consider, also, other alternatives. Would it be just as good to take her and her boss out to lunch sometime so they can get to know you better? Introduce you to someone in the department you're looking to apply to? Etc. 

The amount of effort it takes to transform a room to a fairy princess place, or whatever, is a way of showing how much affection and respect there is for the colleague that is on the receiving end of this. People are saying: "We value your companionship as a colleague enough to waste our own resources, and some company resources, to do something special for you." When this happens, enjoy the moment, and look forward to the occasion when your colleagues play an elaborate prank on you - on the first of April, or any other day. 

You say that you have "done all without complaining", but perhaps you should be giving some sort of feedback. It doesn't have to be a "complaint", but it's reasonable to discuss your assignments and progress with your manager. Perhaps they have a plan, which includes having you learn to do simple tasks. "Trivial" is perhaps not the best word to choose, because even simple tasks need to be done well, and can be important. Your role as an intern is not just to accept everything unquestioningly. It's fair for you to ask for a clear road map of what progress you will be expected to make in the coming period, and how your current work contributes to this. It's not just about the technical tasks. While you are an intern, it's very important that you make a start on developing the interpersonal skills that will make you successful in the workplace. So take some time to plan how you will present your questions to your manager. Think about what you want to achieve, what you think is reasonable to ask for, and how you will put this across in a way that shows that you are thinking and acting as a professional. Usually, being willing to take some initiative in your own development will be seen as a positive thing. Just make sure that's what you're doing. 

I cannot get the information I need I am emotionally and verbally abused by Bob on a daily basis I cannot get the mentoring I need. 

I like Bob for his technical abilities. I have learned a lot from him on a technical level (he's pretty good on a technical level) the past month I’ve been in this team. I appreciate the mentoring he’s given me, since I am still a junior dev. But working with Bob is a nightmare, and his non-stop verbal abuse is a drain on me, to the point sometimes I ask - "am I really that useless?". I enjoy my work and most if not everyone in the company, but I literally dread having to ask Bob a question, especially at times when he is the only person that knows a technical side of the project. My manager handles his verbal abuse as well, and actively is aware of Bob’s verbal abuse to other devs of the team as well, but with him being a rather shy person, he has never stood up for himself or others, so going to him would likely not be productive. Understanding that he is like this to everyone in the company regardless of their position, it has made me feel I am looking into his verbal abuse too much. Is this normal? Is it worth it to do anything? UPDATE Nov 10 2014: Quite a lot happened today.. I was going to mention to my boss about my thoughts on Bob and how it was really preventing me from both getting a big picture of the project and at the same time, really stifling what I am capable of because: 

At my husband's work his team does a lot of team building events. Recently, one such event (on the clock during normal work hours) involved carpooling to an Asian restaurant to learn how to make sushi. This got me wondering how I would handle such a situation, if I had been on that team, since I suffer from some food allergies, and would likely experience headaches from the airborne allergens if I attended, or worse symptoms if I ate anything that was cooked on cross-contaminated equipment. How should one respond to such a situation? 

One popular solution to overly bright lighting for computer work is to reduce the percent of the fixtures that are switched on. In some offices, this may be as simple as wall switch that allows half of the fixtures to be turned off, while leaving the other half on. In others it might actually require having maintenance unscrew one of two bulbs from the ballast nearest your desk. If many of your co-workers are bothered by the intensity of the light, it may be easy to get them to agree. Don't automatically assume "it's not an option" without actually asking your boss or maintenance whether it would be an option to solve the problems of eyestrain (often the cause of headaches) from excess lighting while doing computer work. At my husband's work, enough people on his team were bothered by the brightness of the light that they successfully petitioned to have the lights over their desks turned off. Finding other ways to block the light from your computer screen or eyes, such as building a monitor hood to block light from glaring on your screen, or wearing a billed hat may help as well. The angle of your monitor to the bulbs can make a difference as well, especially if there are diffusers on the bulbs overhead. Try turning your whole desk 90 degrees or move the screen a foot to the left or right to see if the lighting is less bothersome that way.
