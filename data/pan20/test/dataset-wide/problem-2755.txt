I believe you are up against semantics. The term "void" is commonly used to describe any expanse that appears to contain no objects. However, the true void described by Parmenides is different - that which is not. I truly wish that there were two terms for these two, distinct ideas. I distinguish them this way: The first void can be measured or described in terms of space/time dimension or some other feature, whether concrete or abstract. The true void cannot be measured or described. It is not, therefore there is nothing to measure, nothing to describe. It is not a place you can go. It is not the edge of the universe. It is not even a concept you can form in your mind. Ontologically speaking, and using the terminology of my native Nebraska, it just plain ain't. I would welcome the wisdom and knowledge of trained philosophers who might come up with two different terms for these two different ideas. In popular usage, however, I believe they are forever confounded. 

You are asking what happens when we become aware that what we believe to be the important driving ambition of our life is shown up as insignificant. We experience the sublime. The unpleasant awareness of something more consequential than ourselves which is outside of our knowledge. See the Ridley Scott film, The Duallists, which is based on a Joseph Conrad novel, which in turn draws on a true story of two French officers in Napolean's army who serve effectively, but their careers are consumed by an absurd perpetual standing challenge. Whenever they cross paths they must dual, and somehow they continually fail to kill one another. 

This does not seem to be a question so particular to the music industry. And it is not a question of coming into possession of something. What is purchased in a download of a music file, for instance, but also with the purchase of a DVD, a recording of an NFL game, or a newspaper clipping, is a license to use, with terms limiting the use. We have agreed to terms with the owner of the rights of use. We have made a promise. The moral question boils down to: is there a moral obligation built into every promise? I take Searle's argument for the built in obligation of a promise, in Fact and value, "is" and "ought", and reasons for action, Searle, 2008, to be successful. The specific question is, do we make a promise when we download music? I think it is obvious we do. Musicians who feel these terms are trivial self publish and make their music freely available. The price of admission to a film includes the right to remember the experience and even to tell others about it. If the purple scarf is an original design, then copying it with an intention to sell it is wrong. Society agrees on a time period restricting selling copies of original designs, after which considering the designs to pass into public domain. Copying the scarf for your own use may or may not aggravate the designer. It would be a subjective call, and the designer should be given the opportunity to make the call. 

Referencing oneness does not establish a duality if the agent of awareness (in this case the self) is a subset of the One. As you observe, we can see that the One would have nothing outside itself for reference. The One itself is incongruous with categories or divisions of any kind. However, a point of self-consciousness that exists in the context of time, place and other references, is bound to relate to them, in fact is defined by them. One of these references can be the relationship of the self to that which is beyond reference. The neo-Platonist philosopher Plotinus identified a continuum of relationship from the individual item to the perfect unity of the One. His view was that we as individuals find bliss and fulfillment insofar as we approach "likeness" to the One, as opposed to the veil of tears he called "differentiation," fraught as it is with ambition, competition, desire. I believe this is a similar construct to that of Buddhism, but I defer to those with expertise on the subject. I know I have heard consistent advice from esoteric teachers that we should eschew our individuality, try to blend back into the All or the One through various techniques, including meditation, and various life choices, such as asceticism. However, given our natures, and assuming that we take our present form only for a time and in a particular place, it appears our differentiated selves are the only window we have on the One, which is our source, and in some way our home. So, I must account such awareness as precious, even if its existence only reinforces how temporary and fungible are all subset constructs in contrast to the great construct that includes everything. So identifying the concept of "oneness" strikes me as entirely worthwhile, in that it helps us understand ourselves. 

-What are the philosophical implications of the Higgs mechanism? Developments in science have philosophical implications to the extent they force us to refine philosophical positions we take. Embryonic stem cell research, for instance, is forcing us to refine arguments about when a group of cells become human. A development in our understanding of matter would hopefully affect our understanding of consciousness. Questions within physics aren't, strictly speaking, philosophical questions. Whether an idea can be translated from one theoretical language to another is a philosophical question, and positivism is a dubious answer. If the question is what are the philosophical implications of the Higgs mechanism for theoretical physics then the answer has to do with how physicists handle the translating. But if the question is asking for the philosophical implications in the general sense, that is, to the extent our understanding of matter is affected by the understanding of the theory of the Higgs mechanism, then the answer is wait and see. The role of causality in consciousness is the philosophical question and the Higgs theory does not seem to be developed enough to help us refine our conception of consciousness. 

I am a little over my head here, but it may be in the works of Heidegger that the distinction between a thing and anything that attempts to represent it is called out. Recalling from my reading, this includes the neurological impression a thing makes upon your sense of sight or touch or any other means of perception and the mysterious mechanism that transmits that impression to whatever your mind might be. So certainly and obviously language, but I believe mathematics, too, can never be more than an imperfect representation of reality. However, it can be good enough: good enough for us to think meaningfully about it, to postulate theories on its hows and whys. So, this is no denigration of math, just a disquisition on epistemology - what it is possible for us to know. I invite those with more developed educations to elaborate on this, and correct any errors. 

Telling truth is the product of an intention. If the mind of the truth teller is uncluttered by an intent to deceive, he/she is not subject to disapproval, in normal circumstances. But the intent to tell the truth bears a specious connection to what is actually true. We are begging questions of epistemology - what it is possible to "know." We shall assume, however tentatively, that there is such a thing as "the truth." A person's intent to tell it, however sincere, is only a guarantee of the teller's intention, nothing more. Experience with the human mind teaches that mistakes are such a commonplace, their absence in our thinking is the exception. 

I do not think the possibility of holding contradictory beliefs is controversial. For instance, a simultaneous belief in a god and a causal universe is commonplace. Claiming to know both are true is controversial.. In the preface paradox I claim I both know every statement I wrote is accurate, and I know I made a mistake somewhere. In the lottery paradox I say to a friend who is buying a ticket, "I know you won't win, and I know someone will win." Say a lottery is held which guarantees a winner while maintaining the ridiculously long odds of typical lotteries. I know, with a probability greater than .99 that my friend will lose, so I confidently claim I know he will lose. I cannot claim that each participant will lose, though, because I also know someone will win. The challenge is to define criteria of knowledge which exclude contradictory knowledge claims and yet justify some knowledge claims. Gettier argues successfully that we do not know how to do this. I do not know who argues successfully that we do know how. 

I believe you are using it - language itself is the language of qualitative analysis. As in disciplines like the law, language used as such is built upon a foundation of agreed upon definitions. Its processes are endless and circular given the fluidity and built-in imprecision of a tool whose lifeblood is metaphor. (Do you see what I did there?) We will always experience a degree of frustration with the gap between the tools we use to describe a thing and the thing itself. However, could this not also be said for mathematics? And in contrasting qualitative with quantitative thinking, could we be describing what the lawyers call a distinction without a difference? 

The answer to your question is yes, if you are polling a general population. When it comes to a community of interest, such as Stack Exchange seeks to build, the answer may be less clear. I believe the activities of the moderators and the rules that are enforced seek to avoid this fallacy. We are approaching - though probably not achieving - something like peer review. However, even the most rigorous peer review can fall prey to the fallacy. Whenever I encounter an up voting criteria for crediting an idea, I think of what I call the Copernicus Factor. Had the survival of Copernican ideas depended on the approval of even his most learned peers, well, it is not that the truth about the structure of the solar system would have never come out, but it certainly would have been frustrated. It is good to be reminded of your question regularly when communicating in this stimulating virtual environment.
