This is an instance of rhinoglottophilia, related to antiresonances and the acoustic structure of these sounds. A parallel case is the change of h to ŋ in the Luyia Bantu language Nyole. 

There is a general belief among phonologists that (regressive) nasal place assimilation is very common: we can usually cite a half-dozen off the top of our individual heads. I think I could cite a few thousand examples, most of which would be Austronesian or Niger-Congo languages. Because there are so many Niger-Congo and Austronesian languages, I would probably be correct in saying that most languages have such assimilation. However, if you're looking for an actually scientific answer, the answer is that nobody knows. The problem is not limited to just place assimilation, but rather follows from the fact that we don't have a sufficient database on what languages do that we can consult, and what we know is skewed in favor of certain languages (those that we, individually, know about). The only South American language that I know anything about is Quechua, which has such assimilation, and I honestly can't say whether it is "common" in South American languages. The other problem is sorting languages as to degree of assimilation. For instance, all Bantu languages (as far as I know) have some place-assimilation (certain nasals always assimilate), but some languages also have un-assimilated nasals (usually from reduction of /mu/), for example Swahili um̩saidie "you should help him". Keley-i (an Austronesian language) has a couple of nasal place assimilation processes, but /m/ does not assimilate, and some outputs of vowel-deletion create unassimilated NC sequences. We know even less about how common it is to have universal place assimilation in a language, versus some non-assimilated cases. It would be a great lifetime project for someone to construct a database whereby we could answer such questions about "how common", but unfortunately all we have to go on is personal experience. 

I would say that it is wrong to say that when we hear the word puppy, we think of the concept of dogs and then we think of the concept animal. That suggests a simple stimulus-response model of word recognition which I would say is wrong. Let's suppose that we have successfully heard "puppy" (not "guppy", "puffy", "putty"), then we can access whatever / wherever the mental concept "puppy" is, that is, we will have identified an intended concept. We may or not may not "think of" a specific puppy. Perhaps when you say "think of", you mean "access". We may or may not then access hierarchically related concepts like "dog", "mammal", "animal", "happiness", "paper towel" and so on. With this concept accessed, we have access to whatever other facts we know are also true of the referent. Saying that linguistic units are organized in conceptual categories implies that the categories exist independent of their symbolic labels, thus the categories "green", "blue" and "grue" (which is the unification of "green" and "blue") exist, even if your language does not have any of these categories. Presumably you see the problem with that. It would, however, be correct to say that when a concept is formed, it needs some (linguistic) label so that you can use the concept. From the standpoint of acquisition, it is most likely that a person will first learn a word and then learn what it refers to, but adults especially can know of real-world things without knowing what they are called (for example "soffit"). In that intermediate period, you can have an awareness that there are these things on / in houses, but you don't know the word "soffit". In that case, I would conclude that you have an incomplete concept, lacking the label that allows you to exploit the concept. One of the other sides of the coin is the question whether each linguistic unit does represent a conceptual category. It is easy to see that that is not always so, for example with "dog". That refers to at least three distinct concepts. One is a concept of action, of "pestering". One refers to a species of canid; and one refers to a thing that blocks movement (e.g. "feed dogs" on a sewing machine). 

You can find one list of phonemes here. These are for the most part IPA symbols, except for ḱ etc. for "palatals" and numerically-subscripted h for "laryngeals". This represents the standard reconstruction / phonetic interpretation, but there are alternative theories (such as that supposed d,g were really t,k and p,t,k were pʰ,tʰ,kʰ). There are non-substantive alternative transcription practices such as use of hooked-ɦ as the diacritic for the voiced aspirates -- IPA doesn't mandate use of one vs. the other, and it isn't clear whether there's a difference between bʰ and bʱ in languages -- also, the voiced aspirates can be written as b̤. That article gives a decent overview of controversies regarding the reconstructed phonemic system and transliteration practices. 

This paper may be useful for its collection of references. This paper is a single simple read. The problem is that the spectral properties of fricatives are usually reported in terms of the frequency of the spectral peak, where /f/ and /s/ are clearly different but also above the cutoff frequency for the phone. Another part of the black box that you're up against is that the ASR system doesn't involve a small, phonetically trained human making spectrograms, so you'd need to come up with a reason to think that the system they used has problems. (It isn't generally the case that nobody can distinguish [s] and [f] on the phone, and I think that some ASR systems introduce problems, so learning how ASR works could be helpful).

A concept is actually pairing of "what it refers to" (meaning) and a word, so "cow" refers to, well, you know what, and "gabba" (a word of North Saami) refers to "white reindeer", where we use a phrase since we have no reason to have specifically identifies a concept "Whitereindeer". A better way of putting it is in terms of "expressions", i.e. some phrase in one language is used for some purpose, like "you're welcome". Your example is an example of a "calque", which is a word for word loan translation. 

The usual understanding of "naturalness" is either cross-linguistic statistical frequency or asymmetrical implication (e.g. "no language has X unless they also have Y"). If we take the letters a,e at IPA face value, then this could be true. The main problem is that "a" is not a particularly uniformly-used letter – it represents something low and not rounded, but the exact location is up for grabs. There actually is no IPA letter that ideally reflects the pronunciation of "a" in Spanish or German, rather, the typical pronunciation of "a" in Arabic (katab "he wrote", Levantine pronunciation) is closest to Jones cardinal vowel 4. So if for example the letter "a" is used to represent IPA [ɑ] and "e" is used to represent [æ], a "naturalness" claim is on shaker grounds. With those caveats, the most common vowel in human language is [a], and there is a widespread, probably universal implication that any language with [e] also has [a], but the reverse is not the case. There is, of course, the question of the Proto-Indo-European vowel system where "a" seems to be more marked that "e", which itself could suggest that the letters shouldn't be taken to represent those most common phonetic values. A third factor that bears on the concept of "naturalness" is whether phonological distinctions are phonetically sensible under one theory vs. the other. If "a" causes palatalization of a preceding consonant, that is more sensible if "a" is really [e]; if "e" causes retraction of i to some back vowel, that is more sensible if "e" is really [a]. As always, you have to clear about the supposed phonetic values of the vowels in question. In Arabic, "a" has an affinity for fronting and raising to [e] or [i], which isn't particularly natural if you think of "a" as the back vowel [ɑ]. But it is less surprising if it is a front vowel, as it actually is in Arabic. 

I speak that dialect, where that distinction is made, though many people don't and they just use "was". It is pointless to object to an established dialect that others speak. Since this is something that you were taught and don't natively know the answer to, you should let this go and focus on situations where "creative" stretching of language leads to actual confusion. So in my dialect, it's not associated with formality, it's just there. There's a whopping difference between "If I was rude..." and "If I were rude...", where the former can felicitously be followed by "I apologize" and the latter can be felicitously followed by "I would have have objected to your silly comment". In the first case, you don't know if you were being rude, and in the latter case you know (believe) that you were not being rule, which is what counterfactuality is about. {Addendum} There is more to it than mere conterfactuality. I find "If I was/were you, I'd exit here" both acceptable, even though I clearly am not you. The difference is that in this case, I'm not strongly asserting that my being you is counter to fact, whereas in "If I were rude..." cases, the point is deny that you are being rude. I'll have to think over the pragmatic nuances of the two constructions in that context. 

Abstracting away from the specific loanword relationship, there are two kinds of "ð", a fricative and an approximant. The lenited "δ" (oft transcribed as ð) of Danish is an example, and "ð" in some Kurdish dialects is quite similar. There are also a few Bantu language which have a "non-palatal" [j], that is, a [j] (IPA for y) which doesn't have the same tongue-raising usually associated with [j], which sounds very much like the dental approximant of Danish and Kurdish. If Vietnamese had a non-palatal /j/ at that point in its history, that would explain the pattern of borrowing.
