You can use batting average to measure, for example, the probability that one of two players gets a hit in their next at-bat. That would be . So these two players, on average, will get one hit between the two of them about half the time. You cannot determine that with SLG, of course, as SLG does not measure proportion of at bats with hits. SLG measures total bases, though, so you can use that. For example, in this case, you would say that the expected value of Player A's total bases after one at-bat is 0.450 (his SLG). So, in an average at-bat Player A records 0.45 bases. Player B, similarly, records 0.32 bases in an average at-bat. This all assumes that it is an offical at-bat, and not a walk or similar, of course. If you want to combine the two, then, you would add the terms together. You would say, "The expected value of total bases after both Player A and Player B bat is 0.32+0.45 = 0.77", meaning after the two of them bat, on average 0.77 bases are recorded. You could actually do this with batting averages, too, of course. 0.300 is also the expected value of the "hit" statistic after an at-bat. So after the two players both bat, the expected value of "hits" for the team for those two at-bats is 0.3+0.28 = 0.58. This is fairly easy to see; you already calculated the joint probability of at least one hit (0.496), and the probability of both of them getting a hit is easy (0.3*0.28 = .084). Sum those two together and you get 0.58 again. 

The umpires don't just go take a nap after the game - there's plenty of time between the run actually scoring and them leaving for the opposing manager to let them know they'd like to appeal the play. The only restriction is that the defensive team must make the appeal before leaving the field (rule 5.09(c)): 

It's unclear what you mean about twitching his foot, but it sounds like it might be legal and might not be depending on the particular action of the foot. 

Basically, the "salary cap department" is code for "analytics". Not only are they working on actual salary cap issues - which is undoubtedly more than one person's full time job, for the same reason as even a small company needs a full time accountant; keeping in compliance with every small detail is important - but they're doing other similar analytic tasks, such as analyzing player performance, finding players who fit their cap space and also are predicted by their statistical models as good candidates, etc. 

The 3 races in 6 weeks isn't the issue. While some horses will race only in one race - particularly the Derby - most of them are racing all three unless they get hurt. Instead, there are several contributing factors making it harder to win the triple crown. 

One note about the NBA: Because of the NBA's very ... odd ... salary cap, it actually has less fairness. That's because Lebron-type players are badly underpaid due to the player-salary limit. NFL and NHL style salary caps are much more fair in terms of evening out competition. They also reward good front offices though - which is probably why they have fewer 'new winners' compared to the MLB. They also have less trading than the MLB of future talent for now talent, meaning that teams like the Rays, the Royals, the A's, etc. can grow on relatively small salaries by trading their good players away for future prospects who will be much cheaper. MLB also has a far more limited salary structure for newer players - most players play three full seasons for almost nothing and three more at very low rates before becoming free agents, as opposed to the NFL (rookie salaries are limited, but far less so than MLB) or NBA. 

These are a combination of my limited experience watching 3 on 3 NHL hockey, and reading some articles on amateur 3 on 3 strategies. Some of those don't apply to the NHL (smaller ice, for example, is of course off the table), but there is interesting information there nonetheless. This article is the one I most used to source this. 

See Wikipedia's All Star Game entry and this ESPN Article on the rules changes for 2010 for more detail. 

The rule for a penalty during a forward pass is slightly different, but has the same result: enforcement is from either the previous spot or the dead ball spot, whichever favors the offense more. 

This is generally answerable considering the probability of winning given the coin toss; I haven't seen anyone modelling specifically the chance of taking the opening kick for a TD. That's because that is not the only factor at hand in the overtime consideration; a proper evaluation needs to consider the entirety of the outcomes of overtime in order to evaluate whether it favors the receiving team. As of late 2015, the receiving team had won slightly more than half of the time (50.7%) since the new overtime rules (allowing a drive after a made FG - it used to be even a made FG ended the overtime). ESPN estimated a 53.8% chance overall (likely higher than observed when you control for the already-extant likelihoods, specifically the better team being already more likely to win). In 2014, in a blog post at the Harvard Sports Analysis Collective, an analysis was done to determine the odds of winning an overtime game based on a Markov chain analysis. Among other things, it noted that a drive from a kickoff ends in a touchdown about 20% of the time; this was before the adjustment to the touchback distance, though, so I would not necessarily take this as correct for 2016 and beyond. I'm also skeptical that you can consider an early game drive similarly to a late game drive or OT; a lot of information has changed hands by that point, leading both sides to have some opportunities to improve - but perhaps one more than the other; and further, defenses are tired (and while both sides may be tired, it seems to hurt defenses more than offenses overall). 

Stealing signs is "wrong" because Baseball's history goes back to the 1800s, when it was more of a "gentleman's game" (as compared to, say, American Football) and things like stealing signs would have been seen as beneath the managers (and players). The idea is that the purity of the batter versus pitcher matchup should not be tarnished (on either side - pitchers should not use spitballs or pine tar to alter the ball, batters should not rely on information given to them by others). However, in the modern day no-one would really complain about the simple versions of stealing signs - the runner at second base tipping the batter off. They specifically use special signs to avoid that happening, and often switch them up mid-game or even mid-at bat. What the complaints are typically, are that someone is either using technology (such as a hidden camera) or the old-school version of that, namely a person in the bleachers with a phone or similar. That's considered cheating, since it involves people not in the game communicating information. This is something that's fairly well covered in the media. MLB.com published an article on the subject, Fair or Foul? Sign-stealing is part of the game for example. They begin: 

The NBA licenses its jersey sales through NBA Properties, inc., the licensing and marketing branch of the NBA. This private company negotiates deals with the various sportswear companies (such as Adidas) to produce, market, and sell the jerseys, and handles all income related to the jerseys. NBA Properties income is included in the CBA as Basketball Related Income, and as such is redistributed to the players as part of the salary cap. It's unclear if a separate payment occurs or not; this agreement is not unfortunately public knowledge as far as I can tell. The Uniform Player Contract signs away the naming rights to NBA Properties per the Group Licensing Agreement and does not specify a payment. However, articles like this one claim that all players receive an equal cut of jersey sales. I doubt that, personally; every piece of real evidence I see suggests that jersey sales are simply part of BRI and thus each player receives their cut in proportion to their total salary. The NBA is somewhat unique among leagues; the other three leagues reserve the naming rights to the players' association, NFLPA, MLBPA, NHLPA, and each have a separate contract. That means that players then receive a cut from that, and they are free to agree to cut that however they choose. Some players in those leagues opt out (though that seems to be rarer now). The last player that was able to opt out, as far as I can tell, from the NBA agreement was Michael Jordan (in 1992). The Group Licensing Agreement of 1995 (which is still largely in force today) seems to have eliminated that possibility. So the full answer to your question is: yes, NBA players receive money from their jersey sales, but it is not directly related. The jersey sales inflate the total amount of money in the league, and players receive a proportion of that (44.75% approximately, with some variance). (Some salaries are more or less determined than others by this. Some of the 'exception' salaries for example are not really related to BRI - they're set in stone by the CBA, though their amounts undoubtedly were determined to some extent by projected BRIs. The fact that the BRI amount has dramatically risen (above and beyond what the CBA in 2011 expected, by a lot) means players playing under those exceptions are receiving less now than they were a few years ago proportionally; though of course, the increase in total cap (almost doubling) means higher quality players don't need the exceptions and probably the players getting them now would've been minimum salary guys a few years ago.) 

This has happened fairly often, actually; Sports-Reference.com lists twenty-one defunct conferences versus thirty-three active conferences. I don't know much about the specific histories of the conferences, unfortunately. The most recent dissolved conference is the Great West Conference, dissolved after the 2013 season. 

Two sports seem relevant here: Basketball and Hockey. In basketball, you have plays drawn up, but you also have a very fluid situation where your play can quickly break down. While you wouldn't have a player eliminated, you do use a useful concept: the reset. The point guard (or other ball controlling player, if you're the Cavs or such) takes the ball to the top of the key, and calls a new play, discarding whatever they'd done before. In your case, a regroup and reset when a player is eliminated - and a strategy for how to deal with this in-between time - may allow you to go back to a full-on play with all players. Hockey, on the other hand, has the concept of an eliminated player (or even two), via penalties. As such, hockey teams have different strategies for 5 on 4 and 5 on 3, on both sides. If you're on the 4 or 3 side, you're playing a defensive-focused game; there are specific well-defined strategies that minimize the offense's chances. On the 5 side, there are more offensive-focused strategies that maximize your chances while taking into account the defensive changes that will be made by the short side. In your game, I don't know if you're in quite as straightforward of a situation as far as offense/defense when a player is eliminated; presumably an eliminated player when you're on your own end isn't eliminated for very long, since he/she is closer to their goal, so perhaps you have to focus more on strategies for attacking a player down. This doesn't have to be quite as complicated as "all relevant subsets", though it is trending in that direction (and I imagine professional-level teams would); it could be as simple as recognizing what a player down means for your protections and adjusting them, regardless of which player is down (though your positional differences make some difference there - in most sports, all players are effectively equal in at least legal play, other than goaltenders).

(Source: NHL Rulebook) What caused the NHL to choose to change this rule? And if the reason is considered solely the IIHF's decision to do the same earlier in the year or some other rule-making body's similar acts, what was the ultimate cause for that change? Note that the NHL does still explicitly permit lacrosse-style moves (where the puck is picked up on the stick and then whipped into the goal), while the IIHF banned those as well. I'm specifically looking for evidence (cited evidence from a reliable NHL source, or at minimum a sportswriter with intimate knowledge of the game) as opposed to theories. 

That describes more aptly what it sounds like was the problem: if the players were never set properly to begin with, it's not a shift. I'm not sure why a penalty isn't explicitly listed here, but it would be similar to a false start, so why not call it that. It's also not clear if it's a dead ball foul (like false start) or a live one, but dead ball makes sense to me. 

Baseball also has a lot of individual interactions to track, meaning you can get a lot more meaning out of them. 600 plate appearances per year for batters; 150-200 innings for starting pitchers (meaning 600-800 batters faced or more). Those numbers mean you can get a lot of information out of even complex interactions. On the other hand, you have football, where running backs touch the ball maybe 300 times a season, quarterbacks maybe a bit more than that, and the rest of the players nearly all have fewer than 100 touches a season. Basketball has a bit more in the numbers department (thousands of shots per season), and that's why it is more-or-less the second best statistical sport. Hockey you have a few hundred shots per season, perhaps, and there are some things you can do based on game appearances - which is where the best stats are found in hockey (like the Fenwick or Corsi statistics). Quantity will somewhat make up for quality in statistics; Baseball, though, has both.
