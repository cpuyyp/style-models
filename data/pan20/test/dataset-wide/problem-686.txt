How long are your rides, and how well do you fuel up before and during rides? Cramping is likely due to mineral or salt imbalance (sodium, potassium, and magnesium, calcium, plus a few other more minor ones). It could also be due to lack of energy of your muscles to continue working. Either could be compounded with rides longer than your body is used to, and both are relatively easy to solve (assuming that it's not a bigger problem). Depending on how long/intense your rides are getting, it may be a good time to focus a bit more on nutrition & making sure you have enough energy & salts/minerals for the ride. Most people consume far too much sodium (at least in some Western countries), and not enough potassium. A balance of both is needed for muscle contraction. Magnesium and calcium are also needed. Dark leafy greens are great for potassium & magnesium, and there are many of sources of calcium out there (think dairy, and there are others as well). Managing a minimum sodium intake is usually not an issue, however too much can be problematic for other reasons. Supplements can help. Gatorade and other commercial products might be useful too, and may also help if your body is running low on energy. If the cramping is towards the end of your ride, it may be that your body's store of rapidly available energy is running out. A small, carbohydrate-rich snack before (and perhaps during your ride-depending on the length) may help. Doesn't hurt to try it to see if it helps. As you increase ride length/intensity, your body will adapt and store more rapidly-available energy for next time, but this can take time to develop. Also needed for this is adequate recovery time between rides. This all assumes a decent warm-up, stretching, and adequate hydration for your rides. As always, do your own research & consult with a professional when making dietary decisions. I'm just some random person on the internet. 

So I broke my second front wheel last night when I hit a dip that rose too quickly for my wheel to climb before all my weight went behind it. I'm a big guy (300+ lbs), so my wheels need to be able to take a beating. Right now I have a 2014 Specialized Rockhopper Comp 29er with the original fork, tires, and just about everything except the peddles and wheels. I upgraded to Mavic CrossOnes last year after I taco'ed the original front wheel on a hard turn. I am getting tired of replacing these wheels. It is getting a bit expensive too. So I want to find some really tough rims and from what I read you need to get wheels that have a wider inner rim. The Mavics are 19mm if I remember correctly. I am thinking about upgrading to a DT Swiss EX 471 29er rim which has a 25mm inner width. But I would like to stick with the ground control tires I already have and really like. Would my 2.1" Ground Control tire work on this wider rim? I am also considering going tubeless. Also, any recommendations for stronger wheels for my heavy body? 

I broke my second front wheel last night when I hit a dip that rose too quickly on the far side. The wheel didn't get a chance to redirect the force upward before all my weight went behind it. I'm a big guy, 300+ lbs, so I need some sturdy wheels. Especially in the front. From what I am reading so far I should go for a wheel with a wider inner width. The Mavic CrossOne 29er wheel that I broke is 19mm. I ride a 2014 Specialize Rockhopper Comp 29er. It has been an awesome bike for the most part. The only problem I have been having is the wheels really. I don't want to keep replacing them. I really like the tires that came with it. The Ground Control 2.1" tires. Please help me figure out what I need to do to find a wheel that can survive my heavy butt. What do I need to look for in a bike? 

Flat bars have never been comfortable for me for long rides. Check out this link, Sheldon Brown talks a lot about posture to eliminate pain here: $URL$ 

I was taught how to track stand on a fixed gear bike by some velodrome riders and here are some pointers they gave me that really helped me. Keep your pedals roughly horizontal, and turn your front wheel about 45 degrees towards the side that has the front foot. Most beginners don't do this, they move their wheel left/right in an attempt to stabilize the trackstand. While this may work temporarily, it is very bad technique and you won't be able to progress to long seated trackstands like this. Assuming you ride on the right side of the road it is good to learn with the wheel facing left, so that when you get better you'l be able to utilize the camber of the road (you want the wheel pointed uphill, which will be left if you're on the right side of the road). Learning on slight hills is definitely a good idea, but not necessary if you're on a fixed gear bike. I learned to trackstand by not thinking about just stopping and balancing, but focusing on riding into the trackstand. as the pedals approached the horizontal position, I would slow them down, and I'd try to stop with the front pedal slightly higher than the back pedal, this gave me slightly better leverage. Now the important thing is to not rely on turning the wheel right if you start falling over to the right. Use your center of balance to overcompensate to the left. If you see you're constantly falling right, lean more left, and vice versa. Another very important thing to remember while learning is trackstanding is not about standing perfectly still when you're learning, its about forward and backwards movement. If you're on a fixie, alternate putting a tiny amount of pressure on the front foot and on the back foot. You will be rocking back and forth (quite a bit at first), but as you get better you will minimize these movements. On a freewheel the gravity provides the backwards motion, so you apply pressure on the front foot, then let off slightly to rock back. This rocking motion is critical in acquiring the right balance. Again, you should NOT be moving your wheel left-right. You should be using your center of balance for left-right balance, and rock forward and backwards for forwards/backwards balance. Practice is key, eventually I reached the point where I could confidently trackstand sitting down with my hands not on the bars. Re-learning how to trackstand on flat ground on a freewheel is proving to be tough, i'm using the brake to provide a tiny amount of back pressure against the forward pedaling, but havn't been able to maintain it yet really. Hills are cake though. Good luck. sorry for the wall of text. 

If you have slack in the cable, cut the frayed end and cap as usual. If you don't have enough slack, use JB Weld to prevent further unraveling. Work it into the fibers, and wrap with duct tape to hold tight while it cures.

Do not use a mis-matched internal geared hub for your frame. You risk damage to your gear hub, your frame, or both. Aluminum frames are much stiffer than steel frames, which is good for good for riding, but it is also prone to cracking due to this stiffness (when compared to steel's malleability). Even if you do fit the part, it will be a weak point in the frame. 

It's difficult to give a general estimate on how often brake pads should be replaced, as conditions vary. (Including how often you ride, temperature, humidity, do you store your bike in direct sunlight, how old the brakes are, etc.) If it looks worn, replace it. Adjusting brake tension via the screw nuts on the handlebars is the best way to make adjustments. As brakes wear down with use, you will need to make these adjustments to compensate. Needing to do this ever month or two seems within the normal range for how often you use your bike. Another factor to keep in mind is that cables will stretch with use. If the screw nuts on the handlebars are at their limit, you will need to loosen the nut holding the cable at the brake to adjust the cable. (When you make this adjustment, make sure to reset the screw nuts on the handlebar). Your recently purchased brake pads seem fine. I've found that a manufacture will include the housing even if it's not needed. Just be sure to toe-in your brakes slightly, and reset the handlebar screw nuts (and cables) as needed. 

I have seen videos of an aluminum frame snapping at the weld where the front vertical shaft (where the fork is mounted to) shears off the two horizontal/crossbars. Though these people were doing lots of big jumps on their mountain bikes. I think you will have issues with snapping in either case. A number of factors come into play here. Material quality (mixtures, purities, impurties, etc), how the material was formed (die-cast, poured, laser metal sintering, etc), the quality of the welds or glues that hold it together (I am assuming they use some form of gluing for carbon fiber), material thickness, construction design, and a few other factors. The biggest benefit you get from either material over steel is low weight, with carbon fiber being the lightest by far. The next benefit is corrosion/rusting. Aluminum doesn't rust. But it can be corroded. Carbon fiber isn't a metal, so rusting has no possibility. But I would think that it would be more sensitive to acids and bases when it comes to corrosion. Steels biggest advantage is flexibility, it will bend a lot more before it breaks. I have been using aluminum bikes as of recently and they are plenty light for me for my mountain biking. I don't do any big jumps (at this point). So I don't know how it would hold up for that. But I can see it holding up pretty well. And if I were doing a bunch of jumps I would want something with enough heft that I could more easily keep it under me. I would be worried that carbon fiber would be so light weight that I could lose it to a stiff wind while in mid air if I loosen my grip too much. I will say this. Those carbon fiber road bikes are freaking sweet. I never thought I would be able to pickup a bicycle with one finger until I saw one of those.
