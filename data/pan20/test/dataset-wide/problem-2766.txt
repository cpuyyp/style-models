Larry Young and Brian Alexander in their book “The Chemistry Between Us” give evidence that it is neither societies nor cultures that bind us in partnerships but chemical pair-bonding that can be identified in our brains. The cause of what you are concerned about is more at our species level rather than at the level of culture. They also argue for a biological difference between men and women to help explain the benefits of this partnership especially for offspring. This view goes against the “social construction of gender” and they take up this topic aggressively providing a spirited argument against that idea. Our species isn’t the only pair-bonding species. Prairie voles are another which further emphasizes that it is not culture that is driving this. However, even though a brain influence has been identified this does not imply determinism. Cultures and individuals have choices to make. Both have to deal with these almost conflicting aspects of our biology, the pleasurable desire to attach to others and the pain of leaving after a particular attachment has been established. 

Open theism is a libertarian view of free will claiming that God’s omniscience does not extend to knowing the actual choices of free human agents. It is a theory of “dynamic omniscience”. This concept became popular in 1980 with Richard Rice’s book The Openness of God although the history of the idea in Christianity goes back to the 4th century according to Wikipedia: 

He describes three things that need to be done from a neuroscience perspective to obtain compelling evidence for free will. This would be one way to get close to answering the OP's title question: Is there a way to prove the existence of choice and free will? (FW, 122-4): First, we will need to identify which neural events are our “torn decisions”. Torn decisions are the only ones he recognizes as could be neither random nor predetermined, that is, could represent acts of free will. Second, we will need to read off from these neural events representing our torn decisions what those decisions were. As a materialist, he considers these neural events to be our decisions. Third, we will need to identify that nothing causes at least some of these neural events. His approach assumes materialism is true and that our beliefs are neural events. He claims that those who don’t accept his materialism could still use his results to support their positions in favor of free will. 

Camus treats responsibility differently. He does not deny our ability to make choices and so we are still responsible for the consequences of our actions. If he assumed we did not have any free will along with assuming our moral faculties were unreliable, he could also deny our responsibility as well. Consider the OP's question: Camus looks to reject the notion of guilt, but how can he possibly be correct? Whether Camus is correct or not depends on whether one values the evidence of our moral faculties more or less than one values absurdist assumptions.

Libertarianism is a position that there are agents who can exercise free will because reality is not deterministic and agents conscious enough to exercise free will exist. Moral realism provides a justification for praising or blaming a free agent for making a choice. As the quote from Nietzsche mentioned one needs an agent to be free in order to blame or praise that agent. However, one does not need a justification for this blame or praise. A further question tries to link libertarianism with moral realism. 

The presentation of a conflict between Galileo and the Catholic Church may have been more of a conflict in recent times than at the time it occurred motivated by attempts to disparage religion originating in the 19th century than by attempts of religion to restrict science during Galileo's time. That is, it may have been a recent propaganda tool to ridicule religious groups rather than presenting an accurate historical view of the matter. My suspicion that the above is true is based on comments by Feyerabend, Whitehead and Plantinga. Feyerabend is cited by $URL$ as claiming: 

The idea of “creating truth by defining” might be viewed as what Plotinus calls “creative contemplation”. For an overview of Plotinus see the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy’s entry on Plotinus $URL$ and for a translation of the Enneads see $URL$ Although this jumps right into the deep end of neo-Platonism which may not be easy to understand, one can get there through modern physics. See Shimon Malin’s Nature Loves to Hide for an introduction to Plotinus from the perspective of asking questions about the collapse of the wave function. He describes creative experiences of Einstein, Bohr and Heisenberg in terms similar to what you are using. Another place to look is the concept of “motivated reasoning”. $URL$ Although motivated reasoning is associated with self-deception and bias, it might be a way to describe our normal thinking process: we get an insight instantaneously and then rationalize it. That moment of insight would correspond to your "pure a prioric reasoning". When that insight is wrong or socially unacceptable it is call self-deception or rationalization. When it is right, perhaps we give too much credit to our rational process for arriving at the answer. Crediting "reason" for a gut insight we accept emotionally may be another form of rationalization. See Antonio Damasio’s research on brain disorders blocking empathy in Descartes’ Error and Jonathan Haidt’s description of the rationalist delusion, based on Damasio’s work, in The Righteous Mind for more information. EDIT: I asked a related question recently: Do theories come from observations or do they determine what is observed?. See Conifold’s answer and references, in particular the reference to Nersessian, for another approach to this. 

The question, How can someone lack belief in the existence of God given a rational argument justifying the existence of God? assumes that belief is the result of a rational argument rather than an emotional commitment that motivates the search for rational arguments. People who disbelieve in God do something similar to believers except they make different emotional commitments. They also then search for rationalizations for their disbelief. The point: One will not change belief without changing that more basic emotional commitment. To see this rationalization process in daily action outside the controversies of religion consider those bullish on the stock market compared to those bearish on it. Or, consider the rationalizations used by someone choosing one political candidate over another during a political campaign season. The same process of believing leads to motivated reasoning to justify the belief. When one wants to win the “hearts and minds” of adversaries, one has to first win their hearts. Their minds will rationalize whatever their hearts want. To read more about this process look at Jonathan Haidt’s “The Righteous Mind”. The following sentence is puzzling from a theistic position: 

According to Christians, God died through Jesus during a Roman crucifixion. According to Hindus, Krishna, an avatar of Vishnu, died from an arrow wound. $URL$ It is not unthinkable for Gods who have incarnated to die. Regarding the Big Bang, see the debate between William Lane Craig and Quentin Smith, Theism, Atheism, and Big Bang Cosmology. Craig uses the beginning of the universe identified in the Big Bang and the Kalam Cosmological Argument to claim that the universe had a cause outside the universe. He uses Al-Ghazali’s Tahafut Al-Falasifah to show that this cause was an agent who made a choice and because of that a person. So, Big Bang cosmology and belief in God are definitely not completely mutually exclusive. On the contrary, it is lack of belief in God that is challenged by the Big Bang. Smith attempts to defend the position of atheists. The details of the expansion of the universe are speculative. Gravity waves may be a way to see beyond the cosmic microwave background, so evidence of what actually happened is minimal. John Moffat in Reinventing Gravity provides a survey of his search for a gravitation theory that does not require dark matter and offers a different view of the beginning of the universe. Reading his perspective gives one a sense of what is still unknown about the expansion of the universe. For a religious explanation why the universe began at all, the answer would be because God as an agent made a choice to create it. Notice, this explanation is one of agent causation rather than event causation. If an agent makes a choice that is the beginning of an explanatory chain of events. The question whether “there will always be space for religious beliefs” is likely Yes for reasons that have to do with religious belief being innate to our species. The evidence for this innateness of religious belief is surveyed in Justin L. Barrett, Born Believers: The Science of Children’s Religious Belief. The research Barrett presents shows that belief is present in children prior to socialization. Children are not brainwashed nor educated into basic religious beliefs. However, that is only half of the answer. One can then ask if we could somehow evolve out of this basic belief position. This depends on whether one sees Darwinian evolution as phyletic gradualism or punctuated equilibrium. If phyletic gradualism is true then we could evolve out of the innate position of our species to have religious beliefs although it is not clear how we would do that since social construction did not put those beliefs there in the first place. If punctuated equilibrium is true then we would need a speciation event to occur, in other words, our species would have to split into at least two species one of which no longer supported innate beliefs. 

John Searle’s Chinese Room Argument (CRA) (“Minds, Brains and Programs”) provided evidence that computers running programs are not adequate to generate human understanding of language. Since we can understand language, we can conclude that we are not living in a computer simulation based on the CRA. One can pick with confidence between the three alternatives Bostrum offered in the paper’s abstract: 

The Wikipedia article on Free Will calls it “hard incompatibilism”. Here is the graph showing the taxonomy: $URL$ 

For clarity let’s assume the word “rational” means the ability to construct a reason for something regardless of whether it is true or false. That is we have cognitive faculties that allow us to come up with reasons. Then “irrational” would be the opposite or the inability to construct a reason perhaps due to the lack of cognitive faculties. The point of these definitions is to not confuse “unreliable” with “irrational”. Although our beliefs may not be perfectly reliable, being unreliable is not how we experience the beliefs of our cognitive faculties in the real world. In other words empirical evidence suggests that our cognitive faculties are generally reliable. We can even come up with logical examples where they are reliable using the ten of diamonds argument you provided. That we can get such a non-intuitive result about the reliability of our cognitive faculties, assuming naturalism and evolution (N&E), suggests something is wrong with the beliefs leading to that conclusion. They are not describing the real world. In particular, something about the belief N&E is false. We need to take N&E apart and see what we can salvage. The undefeatable defeator claims that our cognitive faculties are unreliable and because of that there is no way to use our cognitive faculties to defeat it. It is not easy to accept this defeator because it contradicts our experience. The real world is not like the world naturalism presents to us. 

Calling the transition from potentiality to actuality in a quantum event a “collapse” presents a non-agent description where the actual event that is observed makes a specific measurement. The potentiality cannot be observed directly but it is represented by a wave function that allows alternate possibilities. Going from alternate possibilities to a specific measurement is the collapse of those possibilities to something specific. In the case of someone making a choice there is nothing odd about this. In that case the person has multiple possibilities and chooses one of them. Again the possibilities could be said to collapse into one measurement, but since this is an acknowledged agent the agent can be said to choose regardless of what one believes about free will or determinism. This means there are at least two ways of looking at the transition from potentialities to one actuality. It could be viewed as a collapse of those potentialities where a non-agent particle is assumed to be involved or it could be viewed as a choice between alternate possibilities where an agent is assumed to be involved. Given Malin’s quote of Dirac describing the collapse as “nature makes a choice” ("Nature Loves to Hide", Chapter 11) suggests that choice could be used in place of collapse. However, using “choice” implies some sort of agent making that choice. Using “choice” suggests we should look for evidence that the agency at the quantum level is more than metaphor. Other possible descriptions such as “actualization” or “manifestation” hide the idea of this agency. They look at what happens as a completed observation. They also hide that there were many alternatives that could have actualized or manifested but did not. They are no better than using the word “observation” which also hides the alternatives available prior to the observation and the choice from or collapse of those alternatives at the end of the process. If one can establish agency of some sort at the quantum level, this implies that "choice" is the right word to use because it is real. That means there is free will at the quantum level. The Conway and Kochen Free Will Theorem uses the assumption of human experimenters having free will to conclude that the quantum system also shares in that free will, but whether humans have free will or not is not universally accepted. Also this does not clarify what kind of agency might be at the quantum level although it might clarify what agency means at our level. It only shows that free will must be there if we have free will.
