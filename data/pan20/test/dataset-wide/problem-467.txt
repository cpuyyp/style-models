What you are trying to avoid is probably in fact almost unavoidable these days. A bike computer head unit that uses a iPhone or Android phone with an app for GPS that does not specifically require creating an account still creates an identity and record of your activities that the computer vendor then stores, sells etc. etc. 

Unfortunately the answer is the same as how you judge the quality of any product. Experience with the product, brand reputation, price (higher correlates somewhat with better performance) and searching for and reading reviews. With respect to your current tires, they are probably not worn out. Not even cheap tires wear out after only 750kms. Road tires have a very shallow 'tread' pattern that is really just cosmetic - bike tires are narrow enough to displace water easily and do not need tread to grip tarmac or concrete surface. See How do I know when to replace my tires?. Also, you should know that higher inflation pressure does not necessarily mean lower rolling resistance on rough surfaces. See this answer and this GCN video. 

I cant think of how an impact or stress fracture would produce that mark. To me it looks like a chip has come off the outer clear coat. Presumably the black mark is cause by cable rub. Approach cautiously. You say the seller sent you a photo so you have not inspected the bike in person yet. When you do, check over the whole frame for other marks, and ask the seller specifically about the mark on the head tube. There are plenty of used bikes out there so don't hesitate to pass if you are not happy. 

It’s hard to give a general figure for how much more expensive a self built custom bike will be, but it’s relatively easy (although time consuming) to figure out how expensive your build will be. Just make a spreadsheet of all the components you will need, and research the best prices online. Don’t forget to factor in all the minor components like grips, cable and brake housing. Also factor in all the special tools you will need to buy (or rent from a local bike co-op). The other thing to consider is the investment you’ll have to make in learning all about component compatibility. There are some compatibility things that are not trivial to figure out. You will also have to learn how to install and adjust every single component on the bike. That's a fairly significant investment in time, both in research and learning and the fiddling around trying to get stuff working right. If learning all that is part of your goal (and it’s a completely reasonable one) all well and good, just know what you are getting into. It’s also possible to scour Craigslist, EBay and local forums for parts, but you really have to know what you are looking for to make sure you get compatible components that are not worn out. 

The general rule does seem to be 2 chains to one cassette. However, if you ride a great deal on a couple of sprockets they may be worn out more than the others. Take a good look at the cassette to see if any of the sprockets are worn. 

According to the Halfords page the Carrera comes with 2.2" front and 2.0" rear. Going up to a 3.0" tire is probably a stretch. The limiting factor is most likely the clearance between the chainstays. If you can, go into a branch of Halfords and have a look at an example of the bike and see how much clearance the tire has there. Also check the fork and seat stay clearance while you are there. The rims may also be below the optimum width to support that wide a tire. If the Carrera won't take 3" tires, as you are buying new , don't event think about changing anything to support wider tires (such as switching to 27.5 wheels), just find and buy a bike that comes with the tire size you want. 

Depends where you are located. Where I live in the US the county has a hazardous waste disposal facility that takes used oil - usually from people changing car and lawnmower engine oil. As an aside, soaking a chain in lube to get it clean will not be very effective. Clean a chain with a de-greaser or solvent (preferably a environment friendlier citrus based one), then re-lube. 

I can infer that a new bike with 6 speeds in the rear is an inexpensive one. It's likely it was not set up correctly when it was assembled. The rear derailleur probably just needs properly adjusting. I'd recommend taking your bike to a local bike store and have their repair shop adjust the gears - it's a short procedure and will not be expensive. You should also ask them to have a look over the bike to check for other assembly or adjustment problems. If the gears were not set up correctly then something else may be wrong, which may cause a safety issue. If you want to tackle it yourself, rear derailleur adjustment can look daunting, but there are several good videos available with procedures to follow that make it quite easy. My favorite is Park Tool Company's YouTube channel (link below). Also check out the Art's Cyclery link in @Matt Morgan's answer. 

What you need is some way to grip or gain purchase on the post so you can apply a force to, then apply the usual methods to free the post from the frame. Possible means of gripping the post I can think of: 

The Cypress is a comfort oriented bike that has a deliberate high handlebar position and upright riding posture. Almost all other bicycle types will have a much lower handlebar position. If you look at the Cypress on the Giant website, you can see the bars are above the level of the seat. On the Roam and Cross City they are about level. General handlebar height is built into the geometry of the frame, but the angle and length of the handlebar stem also affects it. Notice that the Cypress has a stem that raises the bar height considerably. Handlebar height can be adjusted on most bikes, but only by a a few centimeters. It is possible to raise the bars more by swapping the stem for a 'riser' stem as seen on the Cypress. The best approach is to visit local bike shops, test ride some bikes and find one that you are happy with. It's always best to buy the bike you actually want in the first place rather than trying to modify one after buying it. A good bike shop will help you find the bike you want, and would probably be willing to swap the stem on a bike for a riser (if they have one in stock) for a test ride. 

There are many scenes in that video of bikes being ridden well beyond their intended use, and consequently failing. There are some scenes where a bike fails despite not being abused. That does happen occasionally. What you are not seeing is all the millions of times bikes did not fail. 

You should be able to disassemble the pump head and clean out the blockage manually. I’d try 70% isopropyl alcohol as a solvent to help remove sealant. 

As mentioned in comments you most likely applied the brake without the disc between the pads. The pistons advance and do not return all the way to their original position - this is how hydraulic brakes automatically adjust for pad wear. The pistons can be pushed back in. Remove the pads then use a tire lever to push the pistons back in. Then replace the pads. You should be able to find numerous videos showing you how to do this on YouTube. You should check your disc is not warped, and then reinstall the caliper unit. Again there are plenty of how-to videos explaining how to align the caliper. One way is to loosen the caliper bolts, apply the brake so that the pads grip the rotor them tighten the bolts, then release the brake. 

Avid does provide a user manual for the Speed Dial 7 that describes what the different adjusters do. Just google 'avid speed dial 7 manual': $URL$ Sometimes you just have to go old school and read the manual, rather than looking for someone to explain it on YouTube :-) From the diagram in the user guide one can see that the adjustment moves the attachment point of the cable to change how much cable is pulled for per unit of lever pull. At one extreme the caliper will engage quickly, but more force on the lever will be required, and less modulation control will be available (will be harder to stop the wheel locking); at the other end the brake will engage more slowly, but you will need less force on the lever and modulation will be easier. 

If you want to go to a 11-28 cassette from 14-30, max sprocket size is ok. 11 tooth min sprocket may be too small. Capacity is also increased by 1. 11-28 may work but 12-28 is safer. 6, 7 and 8 speed systems use the same sprocket spacing and progressively wider stacks of sprockets. The other thing you will need to check is the lateral range if both the derailleur and shifter. It may not be enough to cover 7 sprockets. 

For threaded 'English' or 'BSA' bottom bracket shells, the standard was 68mm wide for road bikes, 73mm wide for MTB. However, some bikes that are not MTBs use the 73mm wide shell and there are now 100mm wide shells for MTBs as well. By the way, I looked at the Surly Trucker page you linked to, it says the bike has a 68mm shell not 73mm. In any case, yes you can fit that bottom bracket. It has a version specifically for 68 and 73mm threaded shells. On a 68mm shell, two 2.5mm spacers are used so the width of the installed bracket remains the same. You will need compatible MTB style cranks with the correct length spindle of course. Many folks get tripped up trying to install road cranks with a shorter spindle for 68mm shells into a putative 'road' bike with a 73mm shell. 

Shimano groupsets don't get upgraded every year. Each line gets major upgrades every four years or so. Have a look at the Shimano Wikipedia page, road groupsets section for a good overview of generations and when they became available. You should be able to ask any bike store staff what generation of groupset is fitted to any bike they offer and get an honest and accurate answer. If you want to check if a bike is fitted with the current generation, take pictures of the read derailleur, cranks/rings and shifters. Compare them to the pictures of the current generation on the Shimano web site. Each generation is fairly visually distinct. Older generations can be identified by Google image search for specific component identifiers, e.g. for the previous gen 105 rear derailleur. The number of speeds in the cassette can help identify the generation too. 

You are sort-of correct in the assumption that there is a 11-34 cassette in the Tiagra range means it is compatible with a Tiagra rear derailleur, but it's actually only the long cage (GS) version that will take a cassette of that size. Shimano has a nice set of pages that detail compatibility within a groupset, here's the Tiagra page. The Opus web page for the Spark 2 shows it has a Tiagra 4700 series rear derailleur. It's not specified which cage length but the picture clearly shows a long cage (GS) version. You can also check the RD-4700-GS spec page and see it is compatible with a 11-34 cassette. You also need to check that the derailleur works with the FSA crank chainring sizes, which are 48-32 assuming you have a size S frame or larger.
