Official record? No. It's simply not something the UCI has tracked nor has there really been an accurate way to track this. This is the first year where the entire peloton will have their data tracked during the Tour. Cycling isn't like Formula 1 where nearly every datapoint is meticulously tracked. The upside of the UCI weight limit on bikes is that most bikes can now easily come in under the limit and this in turn leaves room for the bikes to carry data trackers, power meters and cameras without incurring any perceived weight penalty. Prior to the UCI weight limit you'd rarely see a racer using a powermeter in competition because they added extra weight. 

Now, all that said if you're going to move forward I strongly suggest using mastik instead of tape. Tape isn't that much less messy and the bond seems to be less consistent then a good gluing job. Park Tool has as good a guide as any on mounting tubulars as anyone: $URL$ A few other tips: 

Really hard to say without knowing what hub you're running. Most likely the pawls failed inside the cassette body. The pawls and springs are the mechanism which allow cassette to spin freely independent of the wheel (like when you coast or spin the cranks backward). When forward pressure is applied to the cassette the pawls and springs engage and thus move the rear wheel. Fixing them can be a very simple process involving nothing more than a couple of allen wrenches or a rather more involved process requiring replacement of the cassette body. Really depends on the specific hub involved. 

Yes, but it can be a useful one. Knowing what is working for you and what isn't can help guide training. Yes, you can plan sessions on power and make sessions repeatable without having differences like weather/route affect the intensity. Intervals can be done to specific ranges of intensity. As for how it works, there are different systems. Some (like the powertap systems) are based in the rear hub and measure the force at the back wheel. Others take their readings from the cranks. Some (eg Garmin vector) take force readings from the pedals. Generally the ones at the crank end of the drivetrain also allow analysis of left/right balance as well as overall power. Some (the cheaper version of the Garmin vector) measure the force on a single side and multiply by two. While cheaper, this isn't as accurate as most people won't be applying power exactly equally through both legs. In terms of the actual sessions, I've not used one but I think the basis is the same as for training with HR. Intervals/intensities are based around your max power (IIRC it's generally based on max power for an hour). See above. I wouldn't invest in one at this stage. Train without one for now and you will still see vast improvements. After a while if you find yourself getting more into it or your progress slows, think about it again. 

No. If nothing else you'd need to strip the frame to have it repainted after the guides are brazed into place. 

They don't shift as well as a double. You have a short cage rear derailleur so max rear cog is 27, maybe 30 teeth. Definitely won't handle 34 teeth. Triple cranks require triple compatible front derailleurs. A double is simpler and lighter. The Interloc will look a lot nicer on your 80s era bike. A triple will usually require a longer bottom bracket spindle than a double. 

If it's an older bike then a pair of center pulls would be quite appropriate. Weinmann made some long reach center pulls in the past that could be picked up on eBay for not much. I think the model 890 and 999 had the longest reach but I can't remember exactly how long it was. Dia Compe still offer a long reach center pull though I'm not sure they reach quite that long. 95mm is quite a stretch, expect to have a lot of brake flex. 

Check out the IRD Defiant wide range double crankset $URL$ It has a 94bcd which allows it to run 46x30 rings. Combine that with a 12-27 cassette or freewheel and you'll have plenty of range. Going to a triple presents a few problems: 

3mm is definitely not enough, especially with plastic fenders! A good rule of them is your fenders should be at least 10mm wider than your tires. I run 42mm tires on one bike and it has 58mm fenders. On my other bike I run 32mm tires and 45mm fenders. You also want at least 12mm between the inside of the fender and the tire. Ideally, you should have 20mm between the tire and point on the frame the fender bolts to (to account for fender thickness, protruding bolt heads and mounting hardware). Keep in mind poorly fitted fenders can be a safety issue. If an object gets kicked up into the fender it can cause a crash. Some good articles on fenders: $URL$ (Jan probably knows more about fenders than anyone in the cycling biz!) 

I have a Specialized Phenom on my mtb that is very comfy and a Specialized saddle (standard one from an Allez) that I use on my commuter bike which is also comfy. The Selle Italia saddle that came on my Cube road bike is not and I'm looking to replace it. Can I assume that all Specialized saddles are modelled around the same shape and will fit the same (for a given size/sit-bone width) and that if I have one the right shape, others will also be or is it a case of taking every model in its own right? Will be a while before I can get time to go to the LBS to try seats. (I know it's not really what this site is for but does anyone have experience with Specialized Toupe saddles? Worth trying?) 

You should just be able to replace the chainrings for 11 spd ones. You can also get 9-spd 105 shifters if you just want tidier cable routing (I assume you mean internal as in under the bar tape) which would let you keep the rest of your groupset as is. 

They do help with training and racing but they are also very expensive. As you say you are a beginner I imagine increases in fitness/strength (and therefore speed) are going to come fast anyway, even without a power readout to base training around. I would definitely invest in a HRM though and make sure the bike computer you use has cadence as well as speed. In terms of specific questions, most are covered by the article you linked. 

It actually doesn't have a big impact on speed. Keep in mind when you're riding it's not just the weight of the bike you're dealing with. It's also the weight of the rider and whatever you're carrying. When you add that up losing a few pounds is rarely more than a total weight reduction of 5%, usually more like 1-2%. If you think dropping a pound off a bike makes a huge difference then next time you're out riding toss a full water bottle off your bike and see if you suddenly become significantly faster. You won't. Race results bear this out. Take a look at the average speed of the 2012 Tour de France and the 1982 Tour de France. During that 30 year gap the average bike dropped more than 6 pounds (25-30%!) in weight yet average speeds have gone up by less than 1mph. Also keep in mind bikes have also become more aerodynamic, teams have become more coordinated in their tactics (thanks to radios and live TV feeds in team cars), riders now train with greater precision (no power meters back in '82) and riders come into the Tour better rested due to a shorter racing schedule. Light bikes feel lighter largely due to a placebo effect. Also if a bike is faster it's hard to say if that's due to it being lighter. Only way to really measure that would be to take two absolutely identical bikes and add weight to one and then do a double blind test with data being captured on a power meter. People have done these studies and the results showed that weight isn't nearly the big deal most of us think it is. All that said, lighter bikes are more fun. They just are. ;) 

The main time I train by HR is for training off the road (on a turbo (or erg - I row as well)). I use it to train in certain bands eg long steady sessions at low intensity holding 150-160 etc. On the road I'll keep an eye on HR and use it as confirmation of perceived effort. I used to use (and still have) a Suunto HR watch (t3c - I think it's discontinued now) that didn't do much more than give a live HR readback. I find it's more useful to have something to log the HR and let you compare it to other efforts (eg, this ride I was 15s faster up climb X for the same HR I must be less tired etc) I would definitely recommend going the ANT+ dedicated unit route rather than using your phone. I use an edge 810 and the tracking/gps is much better than on a phone (the edge 25 uses GLONASS as well as GPS so should be even better). For $150 you should be able to pick up something like the Garmin edge 20 or 25 which will let you record your trips with HR/cadence/speed etc in one place. It integrates nicely with Strava and lets you compare efforts easily. You also get the benefit of it all being in front of you while you're riding. A benefit of ANT+ is that you aren't tied to a brand. If you want to get a new HR strap or want add a cadence sensor. I would also recommend using VeloViewer. It's based on your data from Strava and lets you do much greater analysis (or just makes prettier graphs).
