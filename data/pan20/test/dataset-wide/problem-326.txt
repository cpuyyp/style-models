Persona 4 uses the greater arcana to name various "personas" (demons that are essentially strong helpers for the characters who have mastered calling upon them), but the theme ends there, since the magic attacks are Shin Megami Tensei series staples. JoJo's Bizarre Adventure Part 3 names many of the "stands" (spiritual energy beings that are basically what personas in the Persona series are based on) after greater arcana cards. Their abilities and appearances are often not based on any percieved meaning of the cards themselves, however. In the end, like @MichaelK said, there is no real world "canon" to what the trumps of a Tarot deck actually mean. All of that stuff has been cooked up by mystics and charlatans to make a quick buck off of gullible people, and no doubt it varies between person to person. @a4android did a good job putting down the most common spiel on mystical Tarot. It may be best to just come up with magical associations to the Tarot deck yourself, as most people who want to play or read the lore of an RPG aren't going to demonize its creator for having "improper" ideas of what power each spell named after a card would have, or what powers the card would bestow upon a user. 

As it grew, it would have to find bigger and bigger cylinders, which may limit growth. Then again, a few well-placed fallen trees, and this creature may end up the size of a house! Axle-drive wheels This was the drive method I had the most trouble with. The best I can come up with is a system like the locked wheels above, except that the "feet" that push the creature along push on the center of the wheel, instead of simply sliding. That would allow the creature to have tiny feet and a flabby body, but still get around with ease. 

Fur. Polar-bear-like fur traps heat before it ever reaches the surface; no heat detection for you. This fur covers the creature from head to toe; only the pads of the foot are left un-furred. Switchable vascular system. When at rest, the creature's single heart will pump blood through the body as normal. However, when in stalking mode, certain blood vessels constrict, stopping blood transfer between the "inner" system, around organs and muscles, and "outer" system, a thin mesh just under the skin. The inner system pumps as normal, but is shut off from the outer system. Additionally, it helps the fur hide the creature's body heat. Tail-fan. While at rest or otherwise not stalking prey, the tail is furled and looks, well, like a tail. It helps with balance, etc., but is otherwise a normal tail. However, when stalking, overheated, or trying to woo the ladies, the tail unfurls into a large fan. The fan is covered in capillaries. In stalking mode, the tail is waved quickly back and forth (or up and down, depending on how you want it oriented); the musculature of the tail wraps around blood vessels, so when it waves, it pumps blood. Air passing over the tail cools it, and is fanned away, distributing the heat signature. Blood in the tail is quickly cooled, then circulated through the outer vascular system, cooling internal temperature. 

The comments do a great job pointing out just how fast a bullet from a sniper rifle is, so it's probably not within the scope of realism in your narrative for the vampire to hear the shot and be able to react, especially at a close range. When you say sniper though, I don't often think of the action movie cliché where someone with a high caliber rifle is across the street on top of a parking garage - that's honestly a waste of the potential of the gun, not to mention (even more of) a hazard to bystanders. If the sniper is acting at near maximum range for the weapon, like in a war zone, there are lots of variables that could make him miss his mark. Long distance sniping is like trying to launch a spacecraft - everything is your enemy in the pursuit of precision. I can't speak for the possibility of hearing a sniper and his spotter setting up shop from a mile or so away, but if we were to say our "hero" had some insider info that the victim was about to be sniped, redirecting the bullet through use of force would probably be a better option than just setting up a force field to stop it or catch it. If we're following the action movie cliché, though... @Schrodinger'sStat probably provided the best answer. Noticing the gunman setting up shop would be within the realm of possibility, assuming victim, vampire, and gunman are all close to each other. 

How were the settlers anticipating feeding themselves? I would assume that seeds and farm animals would come along for the ride; even if the planets were habitable, there is no way to know what plants and animals live there, or if they are even edible; however, without the anticipated crop and ranch land, the animals and seeds have to be kept in cryo-storage until habitable domes are set up. That said, synthesizing food is possible, though not easy, and it's not a good long-term plan. The human body needs a lot of different nutrients to survive, and synthetic sources aren't always as good for you as natural ones. Water Without water, there's no point in synthesizing anything, because no one will live long enough to see it. Hopefully, the population has enough water to survive, and a way to recycle waste; there may occasionally be water to find in space, but there is no guarantee. If there's no water, then the population is dead. Micronutrients Micronutrients are required in small amounts; the inorganic nutrients would be easy to either find or synthesize: Boron, Cobalt, Chromium, Copper, Fluoride, Iodine, Iron, Manganese, Molybdenum, Selenium, and Zinc. Any of those not found locally could be even be pulled from parts of the ship; with requirements in the microgram to milligram range, supplies would last quite a while, and generally could be extracted from waste. Organic nutrients (vitamins A, B complex, C, D, E, K, and Carotenoids) are harder to make, but not impossible, especially if you have some basic building blocks and the right equipment. Certain vitamins (especially vitamin D) are created naturally in the body; other vitamins like C are quite easy to synthesize. Many of the B complex vitamins, however, would be fairly difficult to synthesize, and unfortunately are required for healthy living. Difficult, but not impossible. Luckily, the human body can go without many micronutrients for months, even years, with only minimal health impact. Small amounts of micronutrients, far below the recommended values, would be enough to sustain a population of adults for quite a while. Children, of course, should get as much as possible, as their developing bodies need more nutrients than adults. Macronutrients Macronutrients are needed in much greater amounts: carbohydrates, proteins, fats, fibers, and alcohols, the basic sources of calories, as well as essential structures like fatty acids. Of those, carbohydrates and alcohols are very easy to synthesize; both have simple structures that can be created in a lab, though it is much, much easier to distill them from organic sources like plants. Synthetic fiber is fairly easy to create as well, and only needed in low amounts, especially with a synthesized diet designed for minimal waste. Synthetic fats have fairly simple molecular chains and could be synthesized. Synthetic protein, however, has yet to be created in a lab, except by cloning - which, frankly, might be the best option. Cloned meat would be much easier to create than chemically-produced food, and the cloning process would use much, much less material. Assuming there are farm animals, samples could be taken from still-frozen creatures for cloning. Bacteria While bacteria isn't technically a nutrient, it is required to break down food into a digestible form. On Earth, helpful bacteria is easy to come by, but in space, in a sterile environment with no access to other living beings, it's possible for the bacteria in your gut to go extinct - especially if everyone takes any medication that kills off bacteria. I expect one of the biologists will be a "bacteria rancher", keeping a healthy population of gut bacteria in a maintainable way. Otherwise, all it takes is one round antibacterials to wreck your digestion process forever. Short term Many nutrients can be ignored for quite a while; not taking any vitamins for a week (or a month) won't kill you, though going for months on end will make you sick. Most people can go without food for a month without dying, and living on reduced calories for several months would have no lasting side effects apart from weight loss. Synthesized nutrients can replace "real" food for even longer, but be aware that synthetic sources of food often have reduced impacts - that is, eating natural vitamins from a plant will have more impact than synthetic vitamins. Frequent, mandatory checkups can help lessen any nutrient deficiencies. The best case is that the worldship anticipated a "ramp-up" period before the first crops came in, and kept a large stock of pill-form micronutrients and desiccated macronutrients to tide the settlers over. In that case, there would be enough to time clone protein and synthesize the other nutrients, and hopefully get some plants growing. Even basic fungus would be an enormous help towards synthesizing many nutrients. Long term While it may be possible to sustain a population indefinitely on cloned meat and synthetic vitamins, the population will begin to develop various diseases and disorders over time. They will need to focus on building a suitable long-term habitat; assuming they can find a planet with suitable gravity, they should be able to set up habitation domes within a few weeks, have viable gardens within a year. With enough room, in a few years they should have enough herd animals to start eating real meat. Life will still be tough, but at least they won't starve. 

I'm not an astrophysicist, but I'm not sure why either of these options would limit the other. First, Phobos, one of the moons of Mars, is probably going to collide with Mars in ~30 million years. Maybe... speed up that process and not waste an asteroid? Assuming all we need to mine these asteroids for is solar panel materials, we shouldn't have too hard of a time telling which are prime targets for such use, and which simply do not have any valuable resources on them - at least, valuable to us now. So, mine the useful ones, slam the empty ones into Mars - best part of this is when you do want those resources back, you can find them on Mars. If we truly must choose one over the other, I'd have to say make a Dyson Array first. The energy you get back from it is more valuable in both the short and long term than another Earth-like in the same solar system. Even if you're suffering over population, the self powering space colonies you could form on the parts of the array solve that problem. If you still need to terraform Mars, you can easily do it in the future thanks to all of the solar power you've farmed. 

Crying Crying invokes a natural protection instinct in humans and animals alike; or, alternately, invokes the predator instinct of an easy lunch. Either way, mimicking the sound of a child crying is likely to draw the attention of either helpful or hungry marks. As long as there aren't many targets, it's unlikely to be detected, unless a whole gang approaches. Making "helpless" or "hurt" type noises is likely to bring food to your door, and has the added benefit of not being suspicious. Being loud Certain sounds have been shown to have a direct effect on human emotions and physical state: Infrasound, very low frequency sounds, can cause a sense of awe or unease, and certain higher frequencies can cause nausea, irritation, vertigo, and disorientation. While these sounds aren't songs, per se, simply finding the resonant frequency of your target and blasting them with sound waves would likely incapacitate them enough to not be a problem. With a good set of lungs, it wouldn't be hard to take down a human for a few minutes with disorienting ultrasonic bursts. Of course, while loud sound can quickly disable a person, the sound will carry. If using loud noise, especially low frequency noise, make sure your sirens can escape with their target quickly, before anyone else shows up. Survivors are not likely to equate such a creature with the sirens from legend, however. Chemical help The right combination of chemicals secreted by the siren could cause any number of effects, from lowered inhibitions to hallucinations. It may be that the siren's song is merely to draw the gaze if those affected by a chemical substance, such as pheromones; when the affected target hears a "siren song", they turn towards the siren, draw in by motions and sounds she makes. Survivors will only remember a beautiful song. Technical interference The sirens of myth and legend drew sailors to themselves by their siren call, drawing them towards rocks that smashed their ships. Our siren may do just that, only at a higher technology level than mere music. Instead, the siren mimics the "ping" of SONAR, confusing sensors into believing there is danger (or safety) where there is none. With their sensors confused, ships wouldn't be able to spot a floating island, and would wreck; the siren could then further damage the ship, eventually sinking it. The more advanced the ship, however, the more difficult this would be; failing could draw a lot of unwanted attention. "Sound" Not all sound we hear is actual sound; interfering with the brain can cause it to register sounds without those sounds actually being present. The right electromagnetic waves could produce the sensation of music, as well as stimulating the pleasure center of the brain; those affected would claim to have heard a hauntingly beautiful song, but one that they cannot reproduce. While under the influence of the "siren song", they would be in a dreamlike state, unlikely to fight or even notice their surroundings. Survivors may even be tempted to return and find the source of the beautiful music; wearing headphones or noise-cancelling devices wouldn't stop the music, either, meaning detection is very difficult. 

If you're a robot who founded the robot's liberation army, that most likely means you've got robots of varied talents running around. Not everyone is a rough and tumble human fighter. Surely we have robot "shop keepers" (possibly more like robbers who can bring you important goods and maybe a little intelligence?) So, why not have deep infiltration robots? Non-combatant agents who dig deep behind enemy lines, and set up counter-jamming to provide our hero(es) a place to back up before things get out of hand. Assuming every assault on an important human controlled asset is a well planned operation, you don't even necessarily have to answer for why the humans didn't shut down the counter-jamming: it only just happened when you got there, and by that time their resources are more focused on stopping you than killing your save point. EDIT (Per question author's request): Outside of the "robot" theme Theme agnostic, another reasonable idea that might fit all scenarios - especially if we leave the standard RPG fare of infinite amounts of random battles - is that the save point is right before the boss room because the hero(es) have defeated all of the enemy forces and now have a chance to rest before opening those massive doors or heading up that long flight of stairs. Here our protagonists can take the time to eat, write a journal log just in case this is the end of the line, or depending on the scale of the battle, set up shop in this area. "Setting up shop" is basically how the Fire Emblem or Wars series handles saving - saves are only done after skirmishes when key assets have been captured, such as a fort or a castle, or after the enemy has been beaten back from what was already well fortified. 

But what if there are no predators? Islands often have very small, specialized ecosystems; it's not difficult to imagine an island populated by nothing more vicious than a blue-coated critter with green hair and a long nose. In that case, the only limiting factor is food. But what if the food remains plentiful until a certain point, then almost overnight is gone? Rather than a slow, constant, more/less cycle, the food is almost a binary switch - food today, none tomorrow. This would have a huge impact on the survival of the critters. As their population grows, they come closer and closer to destroying their food source, wiping out the entire population. If their population grows too much, they may wipe out the species entirely. So, nature installs a switch. The critters are natural introverts; the more time they spend near other similar creatures, the more stress-induced chemicals build up in their brains. As their population booms, more and more critters accumulate chemicals. At first, the chemicals have little effect, but eventually they cause the critters to essentially go insane, their desire to be away from other critters overriding their self-preservation. The critters will begin chasing other creatures in an attempt to drive them away; a stampede of critters begins, sweeping up a large amount of the population, and terminating in the ocean. The more stress chemical acquired, the stronger the desire to chase, and those initiating the chase are most likely to survive. With a significant portion of the population gone, the rest calm down, and the cycle begins again: 

If there's enough evidence of wrongdoing, of course it would be possible to prosecute, it would just be a long process - but also, I assume this teleporting person isn't just shoplifting, but is in fact breaking major laws. I say this because a years long investigation into a rash of shoplifting incidents doesn't seem realistic. Even with major crimes, this person would have to be committing them over and over in places extremely far apart (which seems like a massive lack of awareness on the part of this criminal) First, we'd have to know the suspect is committing crimes. We'd have to have some kind of evidence that it was this portal user. Eyewitness accounts, video footage, you name it. Unless this portal system is invisible to camera and to the naked eye, both of these would probably result in the witness or viewer of the camera footage saying that this person's method of travel was some kind of portal, or some form of teleportation. Whether that gets believed immediately, especially from an eyewitness, is a different story. With the suspect identified, it's up to investigators to find and present evidence of the fact that the teleporting suspect committed the crime and has the means to teleport. Police would also have to find a way to bring the suspect into custody in a way that mitigates their teleporting, since it goes without saying that they are nearly impossible to contain while still able to use the technology. With all of that in place, a court case only needs evidence compelling enough to convince a jury. Alternatively Let's assume the teleporting criminal is smart and doesn't have the cliché character flaw of being oblivious to the implication of being over 200 miles apart on camera within a matter of 15 minutes. They travel disguised, make sure to come and go in places where there are as few witnesses as possible, commit their crime cleanly and efficiently, and in general leave as little proof as possible... At that point, I think the odds of successful prosecution are slim to none. Various areas in the world would have different accounts, eyewitnesses would be describing a different perpetrator (as would video footage), and if the teleportation was done away from as many people and cameras as possible, the act itself would never be seen. After long enough, if enough eyewitnesses in enough places say they're seeing the perpetrator literally disappear, it might be a detail of interest to police. This person would probably remain an uncaught criminal for the duration of their life thanks to this technology, and until it becomes publicly available (or at least more widely known), no one would know to suspect it. Think about missing persons like D.B. Cooper or unsolved cases like the Zodiac Killer - even without crazy teleporting technology, they got away. All it takes is covering your tracks. 

Magical Size Objects have a size and weight in terms of reality, but magical items also have a magical size and weight. The more magical (and thus the more expensive) and item is, the "bigger" it is in terms of magic. Putting too many magical items together can cause drastic problems; the easiest is that some magical items get magically 'crushed', and cease to work; more interesting may be a magical black hole that suddenly begins effecting reality AND the magical realm. Unexpected combinations Runes may work by simply being close; put rune A and rune B together, and you get a magical anti-fire ring; put rune C and rune D on an amulet, and your can breathe under water. However, if that rune-covered ring is close enough to your rune-cover amulet, you may well accidentally get rune B and rune C to make a (stronger) bond than their previous mix, and make an anti-breathing spell. Oops. Magical Attractor Amulets, rings, and other magical items act as collectors of magical energy, which is what is used to power them. However, like a lightning rod, too many magical items become too strong of a collector, and will overpower themselves, burning out, burning up, or simply ceasing to be. Worse, magical energy is attracted to large piles of magical collectors, which make whoever is wearing a hundred rings an easy target... Magical Repulser Or, from the other side, magical items may work by removing all the "static" of normal magic flow, and keep only the useful bits; the runes act as filters, allowing the devices to store up large amounts of just the right kind of energy. However, this also has the downside of constantly bleeding off magical energy. A little bit is fine, but at some point you start zapping yourself just by moving around. Incompatibility Different magical manufacturers may simply use different magical technology that simply isn't compatible; multiple rings of the same kind of ability may simply not work together, or even cancel each other out: "I've got an iRing of Fire Resistance, but it doesn't stack with my WinBrace of Fire Resistance; I have to choose one or the other. Worse, neither one works with my iAmulet at all unless I buy an iRing of Compatibility, and everyone knows those are insanely expensive! And don't even get me started on how my Helmberry works with my Magicsoft Shield. I'd use Red Helm Linrune, but I don't have time to build it myself..." All of it But why stop at just one reason? One reason can be overcome easily enough. What you need to do is put all of it together: Magic items take up magical space, and putting them too close together creates unexpected combinations; they also attract magical energy, but bleed off the energy they don't use. Together, that means that manufacturers can only guarantee that their own items will work together, because of the careful placement of runes and magical bleed-reducers; mixing products in large amounts can have catastrophic failures. 

To start, there are few insects that don't have that long abdomen, and that's really what receives support on something like a mantis. I assume we want to keep this feature, as it really is the visual indicator of "insect". If we want that to be supported by two legs, they have to be bulky like on a cricket, but probably not made for jumping, as they'd need to be long, too. Walking upright with that configuration seems to me as if it would require the mantis' thin upper body, as well. I have a little bit of an issue wrapping my head around the idea of specialized "arms" that double as "legs", though. It doesn't seem like the kind of thing that could happen. It really depends on the kind of arms/hands you want these creatures to have. I think instead of running on all legs at a greater speed, I would suggest having the back legs be extremely good for running, and joint them in such a way that the insectoid can lean forward for maximum aerodynamics while running. The upper arms, in that case could be used to counterbalance the otherwise lightweight top.
