You then select items randomly from T (if T is infinite, this may require the Axiom of Choice), test p(t) and q(t) and reject the null hypotheses (there are no t such that p(t) and q(t)) if you find even one t such that p(t) and q(t). 

Your second point is incorrect and is easily rebutted. Suppose someone opposed driving cars, and, everytime there was a fatal car accident, claimed their position was strengthened. This argument is invalid because people who support driving cars already know and understand that fatal car accidents will occur, and accept it as one of the risks of driving cars that presumably does not outweigh the benefit. In other words, each new fatal car accident does not provide any new information or a new argument: it is a position driving supporters have heard, considered, and reached a decision on. No sane opponent of gun control denies that guns (knives, bombs, cars, snakes, battery acid, etc) can kill or harm innocent people, either by accident or intentionally. They have already reached the conclusion that the harm of gun control outweighs the benefits. Each new incident does not provide a new argument. Suppose, for example, that gun control opponents had provided a reasonable explanation of why gun control is bad after the last mass shooting. You claim that the new mass shooting weakens their argument, but it doesn't. They can use the exact same argument as before: "we've explained previously that gun control is a bad idea despite all the mass shootings through yesterday; the exact same explanation applies to the mass shooting today, and will apply to all mass shootings in the future. We are already aware that mass shootings have occurred and may continue to occur, and explained why gun control is a bad idea despite these mass shootings". A weaker argument would be: "the infrequency of mass shootings demonstrates that current gun control laws are adequate; if the laws were inadequate, mass shootings would be a leading cause of death, and they are not". Another form of this argument: "if gun control laws were inadequate, over 1,000 people would die daily from mass shootings; the fact that this mass shooting killed fewer than 1,000 people AND that there has not been mass shooting deaths of 1,000 people daily, proves that gun control laws are sufficient. Each mass shooting reminds us how rare mass shootings are, just like each airplane crash reminds how safe air travel is (the media doesn't report on trivial events). Therefore, this shooting is actually proof that gun control laws are adequate". Your first point is interesting and resulted in a long debate between me and @jobermark which doesn't answer the question, but may be of interest. To summarize, I would say appeal to emotion in a moral argument isn't a logical fallacy per se, provided that we accept morality is ultimately based on emotion, provided that you don't make any other logical fallacies while employing the argument. In your "war is bad" example, you are making a one-sided argument (you're not providing emotional arguments that living under oppression is worse than death, for example), but not one that is inherently illogical. Here's how I would breakdown your logic: 

Those mathematical axioms which are taken from experience work so well because reality works so well. Those mathematical axioms which are free and often counterfactual inventions don't work well. A prominent example is transfinite set theory which has not the least practical application. For debunked examples see: "Applications" of set theory in $URL$ p. 124ff. "How is it possible that mathematics, which is a product of human thinking independent of all experience, fits reality in such an excellent way?" [A. Einstein: "Geometrie und Erfahrung", Festvortrag, Berlin (1921), reprinted in A. Einstein: "Mein Weltbild", C. Seelig (ed.), Ullstein, Frankfurt (1966) p. 119] Without mental images from sensory impressions and experience thinking is impossible. Without reality (which includes the apparatus required for thinking as well as the objects of thinking – we never think of an abstractum "number 3" but always of three things or the written 3 or the spoken word or any materialization which could have supplied the abstraction) mathematics could not have evolved like a universe could not have evolved without energy and mass. Therefore real mathematics agrees with reality in the excellent way it does. Einstein answers his question in a relativizing way: "In so far the theorems of mathematics concern reality they are not certain, and in so far as they are certain they do not concern reality." [A. Einstein: "Geometrie und Erfahrung", Festvortrag, Berlin (1921), reprinted in A. Einstein: "Mein Weltbild", C. Seelig (ed.), Ullstein, Frankfurt (1966) p. 119f] He states a contraposition (R ==> ¬C) <==> (C ==> ¬R). Both statements are equivalent. Both statements are false. To contradict them a counterexample is sufficient. A theorem of mathematics is the law of commutation of addition of natural numbers a + b = b + a. It can be proven in every case in the reality of a wallet with two pockets. 

You've run into the much larger issue that it's almost impossible to accurately assign probability in real life. Even determining the probability that the sun will rise tomorrow is philosophically complicated: Sunrise Problem. If you break an event down into subevents, know the probability of those subevents and the interdependence between them, you can indeed compute the probability of the main event. In this case, however, all you've done is move the problem "down" one step. You now have subevents whose probability you don't know. You can continue breaking down these subevents further, but you'll just end up with a large number of simple events whose probability you don't know. Mathematicians (and pure statisticians) work around this problem by using the word "assume" a lot: assume a fair die/coin, assume a random sample/draw, assume people respond accurately to polls, etc. Probability can tell you: if we make certain assumptions, we can compute the probability of something happening. However, these assumptions may or may not apply in the real world. Ultimately, probability answers the question: if we were to repeat this experiment repeatedly, how often would various outcomes occur as we increased the number of trials. In the real world, you never really get to repeat an experiment for the same reason you can't cross the same river twice: the real world is in a constant state of flux, and conditions are never identical twice. 

All well-ordered sets can be compared. They have the same number if they, by preserving their order, can be uniquely mapped or counted onto each other. 

Logic and mathematics are not independent of reality but have been abstracted from reality and are relying on tools of reality when being pursued and expressed in monologue, dialoge and general discourse. Unfortunately this fact has not been recognized even by otherwise very able men. Einstein asks: "How is it possible that mathematics, which is a product of human thinking independent of all experience, fits reality in such an excellent way?" [A. Einstein: "Geometrie und Erfahrung", Festvortrag, Berlin (1921), reprinted in A. Einstein: "Mein Weltbild", C. Seelig (ed.), Ullstein, Frankfurt (1966) p. 119] Without mental images from sensory impressions and experience thinking is impossible. Without reality (which includes the apparatus required for thinking as well as the objects of thinking – we never think of an abstractum "number 3" but always of three things or the written 3 or the spoken word or any materialization which could have supplied the abstraction) mathematics could not have evolved like a universe could not have evolved without energy and mass. Therefore real mathematics agrees with reality in the excellent way it does. Einstein answers his question in a relativizing way: "In so far the theorems of mathematics concern reality they are not certain, and in so far as they are certain they do not concern reality." [loc cit] He states a contraposition (R ==> ¬C) <==> (C ==> ¬R). Both statements are equivalent. Both statements are false. To contradict them a counterexample is sufficient. A theorem of mathematics is the law of commutation of addition of natural numbers a + b = b + a. It can be proven in every case in the reality of a wallet with two pockets. 

On the surface, your argument seems identical to the above. However, once you say "most" or "in general", you are making a statistical statement. Let's state and validate your statement using statistics: 

The closest you could is to use a true quantum mechanical random number generator, and base the program's actions off that. If quantum mechanics is correct in saying the universe is inherently random, the program's actions could not be predicted in advance, and would thus constitute a form of "free will". Of course, that doesn't mean the program (or machine running the program) has free will any more than a rock has free will, but, since you can't predict its actions, it can at least give the illusion of free will, even though it's running a fixed algorithm. There are several methods to generate psuedo-random numbers and sites like $URL$ use atmospheric noise to generate high quality random numbers, but, if you accept that atmospheric noise is predictable (ie, it measures something "large" enough that quantum randomness "averages out"), then your program's actions could still theoretically be predictable. By using a true quantum random number generator, your machine/program's actions would be unpredictable, even in theory. NOTE: google suggests there are some sites which offer true quantum-level random numbers and that true quantum-level random number generators (hardware) are available. I did not explore either deeply. 

All theories based upon such axioms would have the same value as transfinite set theory, namely none. Keeping this in mind and ignoring absurd attempts to apply uncountable alphabets or infinite definitions to define uncountably many elements, we can be sure that the axiom of choice is true in every world with correct mathematics and therefore without uncountable sets. 

1) The axiom of infinity is truly an axiom of mathematics, because it is a self-evident thruth. (There are some modern perversions of mathematics which allow for every nonsense as axioms - just like some modern perversions of art allow for shit on the stage.) It is self-evident by the most fundamental action which mathematics is based upon, namely by counting, that for every step reached there is another step possible. However, there are some provisions to observe. A) This statement concerns ideal mathematics, i.e., mathematics that is not restricted by physical constraints. Evidently you cannot count on and on on a pocket calculator, and even if the whole universe were accessible, hardly more than 10^80 numbers could be stored. B) The axiom of infinity as represented in various versions by Richard Dedekind and Guiseppe Peano, or Erhard Schmidt, or Paul Lorenzen, or Abraham Robinson, or Ernst Zermelo, or John von Neumann does not claim actual infinity, i.e., completeness or, as Cantor called it, finished infinity. C) Actual infinity comes only into play with the interpretation of the axiom in set theory where another axiom claims the existence of sets that are temporally invariable and determined solely by their elements. 2) There are pausible reasons to reject the existence of completed infinity. The first one arises from etymology: Finished infinity is cleary a contradiction in itself. Cantor substantiated it with the existence of God who, according to S. Augustin, knows all numbers. And in fact, set theory derives from finished infinity the existence of uncountable sets. Since all definitions form a countabe set, most elements of uncountable sets cannot be defined, known, addressed, or used by humans. Only a God could be responsible for their existence. But there is a simple and irrefutable mathematical contradiction of finished infinity: In many of his proofs Cantor uses the argument that every set of ordinal numbers has a smallest element, for instance in his first application of transfinite induction: "If there were exceptions, then one of them was the smallest, call it a, such that the theorem was valid for all x < a but not for x = a, in contradiction with the proof." [G. Cantor: "Beiträge zur Begründung der transfiniten Mengenlehre 2", Math. Annalen 49 (1897) pp. 207-246, § 18] Why not apply it to the fact that no natural number is sufficient to make the set |N actually infinite? Theorem: The sequence of natural numbers is not actually infinite. Proof: The natural numbers 1, 2, ..., n do not produce an actually infinite set. If there were natural numbers capable of producing an actually infinite set, then one of them was the smallest, call it a, such that the theorem was valid for all x < a but not for x = a. Contradiction. Of course the natural numbers are potentially infinite. This is not disproved. With respect to potential infinity, proofs like this one would be hilarious – and they have frequently been called so. But when the critics are silenced, then set theorists change the meaning of infinity quietly and unnoticed from potential to actual. – A really perfid procedure. By the way, that's why set theorists refuse to "understand" the difference between potential and actual infinity. With a clean distinction between both actual infinity is refuted. 

You could certainly everything we do is "natural" in the sense that we are bound by the laws of physics. If you believe in determinism, everything we do is not only natural, but preordained. However, "natural" isn't always good: 

Phrasing this as a null hypothesis question is awkward (but not impossible), because it's an all-or-none proposition. Your hypothesis: purple swans exist Null hypothesis: it is not the case that purple swans exist Experiment: collect swans, observe color Alternative experiment: collect purple things, see if they are swans Even more alternative experiment: collect things, see if they are purple and swans Conclusion: if more than 0% of the observed swans are purple, we can reject the null hypothesis; if 0% of the observed swans are purple, we cannot reject the null hypothesis (ie, there may or may not be purple swans). Of course, all this assumes we: 

A set is not a container but only its contentents. So one can take the position: Without contents no set. For modern set theorists there is no problem because they are trained to be attracted by obviously counterintuitive or counterfactual properties (like the axiom of choice in cases where a choice, i.e., a real distinction of one element from all others is impossible). But even the founders of set theory considered the empty set as problematic or not existent. In the following I quote some rarely known statements. Bernard Bolzano, the inventor of the notion set (Menge) in mathematics would not have named a nothing an empty set. In German the word set has the meaning of many or great quantity. Often we find in German texts the expression große (great or large) Menge, rarely the expression kleine (small) Menge. Therefore Bolzano apologizes for using this word in case of sets having only two elements: "Allow me to call also a collection containing only two parts a set." [J. Berg (ed.): B. Bolzano, Einleitung zur Grössenlehre, Friedrich Frommann Verlag, Stuttgart (1975) p. 152] Also Richard Dedekind discarded the empty set. But he accepted the singleton, i.e., the non-empty set of less than two elements: "For the uniformity of the wording it is useful to permit also the special case that a system S consists of a single (of one and only one) element a, i.e., that the thing a is element of S but every thing different from a is not an element of S. The empty system, however, which does not contain any element shall be excluded completely for certain reasons, although it might be convenient for other investigations to fabricate such." [R. Dedekind: "Was sind und was sollen die Zahlen?" Vieweg, Braunschweig 1887, 2nd ed. (1893) p. 2] Bertrand Russell considered an empty class as not existing: "An existent class is a class having at least one member." [Bertrand Russell: "On some difficulties in the theory of transfinite numbers and order types", Proc. London Math. Soc. (2) 4 (1906) p. 47] Georg Cantor mentioned the empty set with some reservations and only once in all his work: "Further it is useful to have a symbol expressing the absence of points. We choose for that sake the letter O. P = O means that the set P does not contain any single point. So it is, strictly speaking, not existing as such." [Cantor, p. 146] And even Ernst Zermelo who made the "Axiom II There is an (improper) set, the 'null-set' 0 which does not contain any element" [E. Zermelo: "Untersuchungen über die Grundlagen der Mengenlehre I", Mathematische Annalen 65 (1908) p. 263], this same Zermelo himself said in private correspondence: "It is not a genuine set and was introduced by me only for formal reasons." [E. Zermelo, letter to A. Fraenkel (1 March 1921)] "I increasingly doubt the justifiability of the 'null set'. Perhaps one can dispense with it by restricting the axiom of separation in a suitable way. Indeed, it serves only the purpose of formal simplification." [E. Zermelo, letter to A. Fraenkel (9 May 1921)] So it is all the more courageous that Zermelo based his number system completely on the empty set: { } = 0, {{ }} = 1, {{{ }}} = 2, and so on. He knew at least that there is only one empty set. But many ways to create the empty set could be devised, like the empty set of numbers, the empty set of bananas, the empty set of unicorns, the uncountably many empty sets of all real singletons, and the empty set of all these empty sets. Is it the emptiest set? Anyhow, "zero things" means "no things". So we can safely say (pun intended): Nothing is named the empty set.

Because anyone can edit wikipedia, this doesn't necessarily mean there's a conspiracy re editing the conspiracy theory page, despite my joke in the comments. However, the page is clearly being edited/reverted by people who want to discredit conspiracy theories. 

Note that, if we randomize sufficiently, the only thing that must be perfect is the assertiveness test. All other factors should cancel out. We are also either assuming that past performance implies future performance, or that the givens above are somehow known to be absolutely true. We now statistically establish your conclusion by looking at the 4 cases:
