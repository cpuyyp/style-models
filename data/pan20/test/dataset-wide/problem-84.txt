To be clear, they fly by flapping the wings / soaring on currents, as birds do.The dragons in this case are small (somewhat bigger than a big dog / size of a medium-sized pony). They do not weigh much to be able to fly (how much is still open for debate). Does such a material exist? Would it be plausible to appear naturally in a creature? What speed would a dragon as depicted be able to achieve with wings consisting of this material? 

Earth orbit and Lagrange points. We start with the Moon because it is a convenient source of raw materials which can be exported to build orbital habitats. The moon has no atmosphere, so you can launch stuff using a linear motor mass driver. No big rockets needed.It's also easy to obtain shelter against solar storms and meteorites by going underground. And it is close enough to Earth that self-sufficiency in small light hi-tech items can be postponed (indefinitely?) and emergency evacuation would be possible (mass-driver, one way "lifeboat" capsule). Mars? I doubt it is worth the effort. That thin unbreathable atmosphere is an utter pain to get in to and out of.. Vacuum is easier. Some exploration of the Asteroid belt is likely. It may prove to be a better source of some elements than accessible Lunar rock. If this is the case then there may be semi-permanent settlemens on asteroids, like mining towns on Earth. You need to think big if it is ever going to happen. Shielding against Solar storms requires walls several feet thick. Substituting gravity by rotation likewise implies large. Build habitats a lot like John Varley's titans, but without the insane goddess. The goal? Unlimited real estate. The Earth is getting full. Outside bet? Mercury's poles. There are craters which offer permanent shade, yet nearby (or up a bit) is all the energy one might need. Shame about the Solar gravity well. 

I'm working on creating a species that favours small families for a number of reasons, and have no interest in 'breeding as much as possible'. As a consequence, their population size is small. But how small can a population be, without running (ever) into problems with genetic diversity? I'm interested in more than 'survivability'; the species' gene pool should not degenerate (some margin allowed). I'm looking for some well-founded answers or directions. Assume that genetics for this species works similar to that of humans, and that their gene pool is of good quality at the start. You can also assume that they choose partners wisely, but there is no designation of partners, so margin is necessary. They have good health care and low child mortality rates. Assume that at least 90% of the population reaches at least fertile age. Other 'rules': 

Names may be translatable in some human and alien(?) cultures. "Beautiful Flower" or "Two (medium sized domesticated carnivores) running". The second further translates to "two dogs running" although they are not exactly dogs. The joke about "two man bucket"'s twin brother may translate Ok for these aliens Or less friendly examples, "Second of liars and spies" and presumably "Fifth of slave breeding and sacrifices". (Read Charles Stross's latest for this source). That aside you may as well give them names pronounceable in English. Analysis of dolphin noises suggests that they have sounds for referring to themselves. These sounds are inaccessible to unaided human ears, let alone vocal cords. If humans and aliens have any shared vocal abilities, pick names that are mutually speakable (probably using a restricted set of syllables). In passing: until we can work out how to communicate with dolphins and where they fit on the intelligence spectrum, I hope we do not meet any real aliens. An African Grey parrot named Alex learnt English, proved human-toddler-smart and ultimately broke our hearts. AFAIK no humans have learned parrot. 

This question differs from the question What is the minimum human population necessary for a sustainable colony? because: 

Most (quadruped) dragons are depicted as having two wings sprouting from their back, consisting of a limb structure draped with a leathery membrane as the way to create lift and fly, somewhat resembling bat wings. I'm looking for a material to replace the membrane with, with some better qualities than a thin, fragile piece of skin. I'm excluding feathers and somewhat stiffer wings like pterosaurs seem to have had (according to this question: Bats With Pterosaur Wings). The properties I'm looking for: 

Can you convert a black hole into gravitational radiation? The recently observed merger of two black holes converted three solar masses of black hole, or about 5% of the total mass. So what if you could place a massive object in close orbit around a black hole and feed energy into it to prevent it spiralling in to the black hole? That is a continuous gravitational wave source. The question I don't know the answer to, is whether it will be emitting more in gravitational radiation, than is being supplied to prevent inspiralling. If more, the black hole's mass is being converted to energy. If less, you have just found an exotic and inefficient way to make the black hole grow. One for the physicists, I think! 

While fleshing out the details of my species, I have some concerns regarding reproduction. This species has several constraints which make it difficult to get pregnant and reproduce. These include: Major issue: 

This question differs from the question How many humans do you need to maintain a population indefinitely? because of the given context that everyone in the group is the genetic parent of exactly two children each with a different partner which is violating above assumptions. This question differs from the question Minimum Population For a High Tech Society? because it is not about genetic diversity, but the skills and intelligence needed to run a high tech society (which is possibly a follow-up question). Some other questions touch this topic, but they are (slightly) different in either the assumptions or the direction of the question. 

The colour of a complex organic molecule containing a metal atom is by no means completely determined by that metal. For example, chlorophyll is bright green. The metal it contains is magnesium. Solutions of magnesium salts are usually colourless. Or you might consider the gamut of colours that a nasty bruise goes through as it heals. These are all generated by Iron, as your body recycles it from blood and other tissues as the damage heals. Known here on Earth: certain obscure marine worms use Cobalt-based blood. It is (unsurprisingly?) deep blue. Some of the metals you mention are unlikely to be useful as part of an oxygen-transporting biomolecule. Obviously an alien biochemistry might throw up surprises and the metal or the colour might not necessarily be part of the oxygen transport mechanism. However, to be useful on that front you almost certainly need a metal which exhibits two (or more) oxidation states differing by one. You'll find these in the transition metals on your periodic table. Vanadium through Copper on the first row, and many of the corresponding elements on the two rows below. The element will need to be reasonably abundant, since an organism will need a fair amount of Iron or whatever it can use in place of Iron. Here on Earth the heavier elements in the second and third rows are relatively rare (and of course you get less atoms per gram). The only one which life has made essential use of, is Molybdenum. (A few bacteria use Tungsten but that's not widespread). 

I am concerned that this species has too much of a difficulty to reproduce to make it viable or at least believable. You would think that such a species would probably have gone extinct. I would like the species to be sustainable. My main question is: how can I make this species viable? What can I add to their culture / world / other to make their existence believable? In other words: are there any prerequisites I need to fulfil for it to work? My first idea is to embed the 'find your soul mate' more into their culture, making it a major point on everyone's agenda. I'm not sure yet if this fits the world as it is in my mind, and would love some more input. I'm okay with the idea that the difficult connection as mentioned in the major issue above is more of a recent thing, and that in the past it was a lot easier. But that does not prevent them from going extinct in the (near) future. *Difficult meaning that if the partner is not right, the connection can not be made completely and reproduction is not possible. This goes, of course, both ways. Whether a partner is 'right' depends more on the mental aspect and trust. It can be build between two individuals, but it takes time. Addition: the size of the population and its viability, also regarding number of children or reproductive rates is out of scope for this question. That is already covered in an earlier question: How small can a population be with regard to genetic diversity? 

In thirty years starting from how things are today? No way. The EU is the world's largest attempt at such a coalition. It has been sixty-plus years in the making. It is, to put it mildly, a work still in progress with very many longstanding and unresolved problems. It started with several advantages Asia lacks. A common religious and cultural basis (though you have to dig deep to see that). A common external threat (the USSR). A determination to avoid a third world war starting within Europe. No state large enough to dominate ( Germany was at that time, weak and divided by the iron curtain). Today's EU is (IMO) facing an existential crisis caused largely by politicians trying to hurry things along to their own benefit. If they had left it to develop slowly by genuine popular consent from a free trade area and defense treaty ( NATO) we'd have a much healthier outlook today and the possibility of a happily United states of Europe in the 22nd century. Instead I fear it may disintegrate and even spark the conflict that it was founded to avert. Never under-estimate the extent to which politicians' egos will **** things up for the rest if us. 

I couldn't find a question that addresses something like this. Retractable claws have been discussed: Retractable claws in otherwise human-like hands? But these are (curved) claws on fingers; I'm not sure if their design would work on my creature ('shards' on a tail). 

The creature I'm designing has a tail with spikes on the end of it. The material of the spikes should be strong/durable (not break easily), and very sharp (the edge as well as the sides, being able to cut through most materials like metal). The tail has several uses where these spikes might be a very real problem (like balancing, flexing around stuff to pick it up, and such). I'm looking for a way for the creature to protect itself and its surroundings from these spikes when they are not necessary. So far I've come up with:
