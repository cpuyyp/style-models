One of the biggest problems I have found from self-study is the differing terminologies. I was reaching the same conclusions in study and reflection that were reached 3,500 years ago I just had different words for many of the concepts.I believe there is some of that effect here as well. My simplistic view was/is dukkha identifies the dissatisfaction with impermanent conditions. Sukkha was/is eternal satisfaction. Happiness varies with conditions and is cyclical. Eternal satisfaction, however, is a constant. But thats just my understanding and the terms I use. Explanations vary. 

How do I know if I enjoy answering questions because I feel helpful or because it strokes my ego? Why does this program demand that I add more words to my question? 

The Story of King Pasenadi of Kosala While residing at the Jetavana monastery, the Buddha uttered Verse (204) of this Dhammapada, with reference to King Pasenadi of Kosala. One day, King Pasenadi of Kosala went to the Jetavana monastery after having his full morning meal. It was said that the king had eaten one quarter basket (about half a bushel) of rice with meat curry on that day; so while listening to the Buddha's discourse he felt very sleepy and was nodding most of the time. Seeing him nodding, the Buddha advised him to take a little less rice everyday and to decrease the amount on a sliding scale to the minimum of one-sixteenth part of the original amount he was taking. The king did as he was told and found that by eating less he became thin, but he felt very much lighter and enjoyed much better health. When he told the Buddha about this, the Buddha said to him, "O king! Health is a great boon; contentment is a great wealth; a close and trusted friend is the best relative; Nibbana is the greatest bliss." Then the Buddha spoke in verse as follows: Verse 204: Health is the greatest gift, contentment is the greatest wealth, a trusted friend is the best relative, Nibbana is the greatest bliss. 

we are awareness made flesh. with all the senses and limitations associated with being a human flesh creature. our bodies are on a 75 year camping trip. We're roughing it with these senses and subject to the ravages of time which normally doesnt affect us. in our normal forms, as awareness, we only sense vibrations and "warm" events give us resonant vibrations and harmonies. events other than that cause discordant vibrations and we are repulsed by them. when our bodies die we go back to being awareness. That is our only rebirth or afterlife. man has the capacity to move beyond rebirth, but it will never happen until the human race is homogenized physically and mentally. this just happens with time. 

I am still a novice and searching for specific canon support for Shakyamuni's view on "walking the median path" between dualities. My goal is to dispel this pervasive view that Buddhism is a rigid, cold existence. I think this is my best starting point but haven't read these portions of the dhammapada yet or my memory is just getting bad in my old age. 

Thus, you must work out problems with your own guilt and despair first. Then you will be able to do the same for your family and loved ones and friends. Bring them happiness and comfort as you will instead of sadness. And do the same with other infants and children you encounter. This will overcome any bad karma you may have created as well as helping you avoid such bad relationships and attachments in the future that caused you and yours such pain. namaste. damyata datta dayadhvam. 

I use hypothesis testing. Conceptually, theoretically, philosophically, physically, spiritually, scientifically ... I test things against their most staunch adversary in all different points of view. And I demand the most back-breaking, ego busting opposite viewpoints that I can find. Of course this becomes an almost impossibly hard standard to meet when examining philosophical or theoretical or spiritual areas and checking for their basis in fact and science. So I guess my final test is always true, modern science and then focused more on data than explanations. But at least being a plausible physical theory other than "magic". That's a must. 

I can understand how the Buddha and various arhats and the like can surmise the existence of past lives and rebirth. What I dont see is how they come up with actual numbers of times they have been reborn and the total number of times anyone is and how long the universe has been contracting and expanding and things like that? At some point isn't that delving into the unknowable? 

I start answering these things and I want to pull out a bunch of references and quote books etc.... Then I think "thats just ego if I dont need it to answer". So let's try it this way. Yes, most definitely an after-life exists in Buddhism. We are not really this body. We are the drivers inside it. NOT the brain though, thats physical. That preserves memories and identifies patterns. We are the actual feeling part of the emotions. So we have this shell of a body that dies. It doesn't come back. Inside we have the driver, our consciousness, and it doesn't die. Truthfully it was never an individual. Our consciousness is part of the consciousness whole ... which is subject to all of the feelings of the universe and not just our crappy little 5 senses. Our awareness is limited to this vessel right now. A limitation that goes away as we return to the whole. Once our bodies die we just keep doing this same cycle of crap until we ascend dimensionally. 

I couldnt agree with you more. It IS rather overwhelming from the start. This is the first reason why a good teacher is such a benefit. Absent that at first you at least need a sort of plan of attack. From a laymen's perspective I found seeking refuge in the 3 jewels to be a good framework. Starting with seeking refuge in the Buddha I focused on the story and history of Shakyamuni from his beginnings as Siddartha Gautma to his death. I paid particular attention to his specific historical biography and the influences that would have surrounded him at the time and later as he set about teaching. I also followed his lessons through the first thru third Buddhist councils - up until the point they were committed to writing. In seeking further refuge in the dharma I worked on those lessons as they were subsequently applied against Koans as well as the works of other bhodisattva. The differing ideologies within Buddhism and supporting literature. This process grew organically from the first really. As you break down the basic lessons from the Buddha Shakyamuni ... the 9 factors of this and 32 steps of that ... all of those things make more sense than just random items for memorization. It's the same for meditation techniques. When you know what it is you are doing that action for then it makes knowing how or in what manner to do it easier to comprehend and remember. I am a few years in headfirst now and a few decades in by dabbling. But to date the so-called metaphysical topics to me have found the same theoretical support all the way back to the days before and of Buddha. Thats not necessarily an indictment on how poor our knowledge is today (as some want to use it). It is likewise high praise for the scholarly approach used on topics then purely heuristic and only now seeing support in quantum mechanics and other advanced issues in physics. The physical aspects supporting Buddhism have been well documented for years. Advantages of rested mind meditation have been acknowledged and utilized worldwide both professionally and personally. While the psychology and neurology still need substantial work, the support so far is promising. The point is making a plan with approaches from many different avenues. If you plan to devour a cow you do so 1 meal at a time. I started with seeking refuge in the 3 Jewels, then studied history and comparative ideology, then committed myself to further study in the precepts, then answering the 10 questions to a child. Then I followed as my curiosity suited me and it all grew organically. Find your path. Namaste my friend. 

so many make it seem like some moral judgment ... and it's not. karma is NOT some cosmic sense of moral retribution. it is merely the effects of cosmic momentum amidst the gazillions of intertwined cogs and wheels and gears. you do something with negative consequences then gear 2 goes CW driving shaft 4 parallel to cog 3 which turns CCW which affects 1,204,302,750 other cogs to turn CW and 2,340,369 gears to turn CW at 45 degrees et al. THAT is karma. 

We do not know when consciousness attaches to a vessel. Before that time any damage done would be like kicking the tire of a car. You might be damaging a vessel but there is no effect on a rider. Since we do not know we merely ASSUME it is at conception. This is because making such an assumption errs on the side of safety for the infant - but fails to consider the effects of such an assumption on you. Such was the patriarchal approach to many thoughts in the past as women were relegated to secondary status ... which we now see as wrong. Much of the bad karma you discuss is the effect that such an action has upon yourself and those around you. If it has made you sorrowful and sad then that is the suffering you bring and cause upon others. EVEN IF attachment had occurred you are speaking of a unique situation where such an individual had yet to effect karma and, thus, would be easily able to drift back to the ether (as neutral) or encounter it's rebirth elsewhere with no added causation to overcome. Depending on which side you believe. So as heartless as it may sound this is the one time in our physical existence when such a death would have nary any karmic effect and actual suffering - except to you and your family. 

On some levels this entire discussion causes me sadness. I have spent decades considering just this issue and it wasn't until I stepped back and used some objectivity that I found my answer. First, it is neither my place nor even my intent to disparage the understanding and beliefs of others. We each have our own worlds that we build and reside within and while they do affect one another I feel we should respect that others may see things in a different light than ourselves. That said - I take solace in the views of Buddha concerning attachment. Shakyamuni Buddha understood that his views themselves may be improved upon or further expounded. Thus we see avenues of divergence such as the Theravada and Mahayana views on the anatman. There is certainly nothing to say that these are the only two views that may be taken. Far from the case actually. I have settled upon another view taken from study of the upanishads and the dhammapada. While I agree on the 5 aggregates of existence, I differ on most views regarding the 5th skandha - consciousness. I consider the consciousness to be the self so referenced in the Katha upanishad. The chariot driver. The one which is AWARE. In fact, I believe it much more accurate and eases understanding to just call it "awareness". Thousands of years ago we were not blessed with the scientific knowledge that we have today. We did not understand the biological basis behind many of the things that we defined such as feelings and urges and desires. With ALL of the physical stripped away we still have the "experiencer". The driver. And at that point we can identify all of the physical components so listed in the 5 aggregates - leaving only awareness. At this point is where we find the conflict of "self". I find the eternalism view here to be the correct one for MY understanding. As proscribed in Isha the "self" is one and everywhere. But it would be, again, more accurate to merely refer to this as pure awareness. Much like collecting air in a bag and closing off the open end. Awareness that WAS everywhere and one now has a portion trapped in a vessel of limited perceptions. Whereas before it was eternal and everywhere, now a portion of it is subjected to limitations and the ravages of time. This is actually the self. And it IS an illusion. Because it's really not an individual any more than a bottle of water is different from the ocean. Once free of these constraints it may emerge back into the whole again - provided it is not colored (for lack of another word to use) with karma that keeps it from remerging into the ether. There are many areas of confusion that arise in the definitions of words from culture to culture and century to century. One must learn not to be overly attached or bound to specific words and focus more on the machinations and ideas themselves and see how they comport with what we understand today. As our science and even philosophy and social knowledge increases we lend credence and support to many teachings of the past as well as discovering misgivings in others.Physical basis for consciousness? new studies
