I have seen this claim on the Wikipedia page for the Yang-Mills Millenium problem by Alexander Dynin. He is a mathematician working at the Department of Mathematics of Ohio State University and so, I think his should represent respectable work. The question is that I am a physicist and I have not the right knowledge to approach Dynin's work. Please, could you give me some hints and references about so I can make an idea by myself of these techniques? My aim is to get a comparison with the work currently pursued in the area of theoretical physics about this same problem. Thanks a lot beforehand. 

As OP seems to be stuck, I give here the few lines needed to solve this problem as sugested in the comments. Given $$ f(\mathbf{r})=\int_{\Omega }d^2k\int_{\Omega }d^2q \cos[(\mathbf{k}-\mathbf{q})\cdot\mathbf{r}]= \frac{1}{2}\int_{\Omega }d^2ke^{i\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{r}}\int_{\Omega }d^2qe^{-i\mathbf{q}\cdot\mathbf{r}} +\frac{1}{2}\int_{\Omega }d^2ke^{-i\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{r}}\int_{\Omega }d^2qe^{i\mathbf{q}\cdot\mathbf{r}}. $$ These integrals are easily done to give $$ f(\mathbf{r})=4\frac{(1-\cos(\pi x))(1-\cos(\pi y))}{x^2y^2} $$ from which the asymptotic behavior can be readily gotten. This makes clear that the question is not appropriate here. 

The simplest approach one can think is an iterative one. Let us consider the given equation $$ f(x)=\int_{-\infty}^xG(x,y)f(y)f(x-y)dy. $$ Now, we assume as a first iterate $f^{(0)}(x)=1$ and so $$ f^{(1)}(x)=\int_{-\infty}^xdyG(x,y) $$ $$ f^{(2)}(x)=\int_{-\infty}^xdyG(x,y)\int_{-\infty}^ydwG(y,w)\int_{-\infty}^{x-y}dzG(x-y,z) $$ and so on. One is granted the existence of the n-th iterate provided the integral of $G$ exists and is properly bounded. 

A generic linear function in $t$ as $$u(x,t)=f_1(x)t+f_2(x)$$ does the job but, for the sake of completeness, I give here the result of Mathematica that involves ${\rm erf}^{-1}$, the inverse of the error function, $$u(x,t)=f_1(x)t+f_2(x)+\int_1^tdt'\int_1^{t'}dt''e^{-{\rm erf}^{-1}\left[-\frac{2}{\pi }\left(e^{C_1t''} (x+C_2t'')^2\right)\right]-\frac{1}{2} C_1t''}.$$ 

The best way to proceed is to use Legendre polynomials through the formula $$ \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-2yx+x^2}} = \sum_{n=0}^\infty P_n(y) x^n. $$ In this way you will get closed form integrals with the error function. 

This is a stochastic differential system of equations. I think this can help. You can also check the full syllabus of the course here with the proper references and other material to download. 

The easiest way to prove this is using variational calculus. You have to put $$ \delta I(G(\omega))=0. $$ The calculation is quite straigthforward and provides the condition $$ \delta G(\omega)=0 $$ and so the extremum is for $G(\omega)=G=constant$. Finally, from the condition you have to set $$ \int_{-k\pi}^{k\pi}G(\omega)=2k\pi G=1. $$ This gives the value of the extremum $G=\frac{1}{2k\pi}$. Expanded on OP request: The idea behind functional calculus (calculus of variations) is to consider a class of functionals, as in your case, that can be amenable to a generalized differentiation. You can find all the rules and the definition of a functional derivative here but for a more serious approach some lectures as the ones I pointed out in the comment area are needed. Your case is particularly simple as one is left in each term with the variation of $G(\omega)$ and this must be zero to find an extremum. Update on OP request: Let us introduce the following functional $$ Z_m[G]=\int_{-k\pi}^{k\pi}\frac{A}{G(\omega)+A}e^{-im\omega}d\omega $$ The functional we are considering takes the form $$ I[G]=Z_0[G]-\frac{Z_1^*[G]Z_1[G]}{Z_0[G]}. $$ Now we have $$ \delta Z_m[G]=-\int_{k\pi}^{-k\pi}\frac{A}{(G(\omega)+A)^2}\delta G(\omega)e^{-im\omega}d\omega. $$ Chain rule applies also to functionals and we can evaluate $\delta I[G]$ immediately to give $$ \delta I[G]=\delta Z_0[G]-\frac{Z_1^*[G]Z_1[G]\delta Z_0[G]-Z_0[G]\delta(Z_1^*[G]Z_1[G])}{Z_0^2[G]} $$ and we see that the condition $\delta G(\omega)=0$ sets the variation to zero. This solution is consistent with the given constraint provided $G=\frac{1}{2k\pi}$. The application of the constarint a posteriori fixes the value of the constant. Further clarification for OP: I will show that a functional that does not depend from at least a first derivative is a constant in one dimension. Let us consider the functional $$ S=\int_a^bL(q(t),q'(t),t)dt. $$ The condition for the extremum just gives $\delta S=0$ yielding Euler-Lagrange equation $$ \frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial L}{\partial q'(t)}=\frac{\partial L}{\partial q(t)}. $$ Then, if there is no dependence on derivative we are left with $\frac{\partial L}{\partial q(t)}=0$ that implies immediately $L=L(t)$ and $q(t)=constant$. 

If I understand the question correctly, what you are after is an effective Hamiltonian action of $\mathbb{T}^m$ on a (closed) symplectic manifold $(M,\omega)$ such that there exists a point $p \in M$ with finite stabilizer. If this is the case, there are plenty of examples. Consider a closed symplectic toric manifold $\mu: (M^4,\omega) \to \mathfrak{t}^*$ with Delzant (= moment) polygon $\Delta = \mu(M)$ with the property that the primitive integral tangent vector to the edge $e$ of $\Delta$ is of the form $(k,a) \in \mathbb{Z}^2$ for $|k| > 1$. Writing $\mathbb{T}^2 = S^1 \times S^1$, consider the restriction of this action to the first $S^1$, thus obtaining what is known as a Hamiltonian $S^1$-space $S^1 \curvearrowright (M^4,\omega)$ (these have been classified by Karshon in this paper). The moment map of this action is the composition $\mathrm{pr}_1 \circ \mu : M \to \mathrm{Lie}(S^1)^* \cong \mathbb{R}$, where $\mathrm{pr}_1 : \mathrm{t}^* \to \mathrm{Lie}(S^1)^*$ is the projection induced by the inclusion $S^1 \hookrightarrow \mathbb{T}^2$. Any point $p \in \mu^{-1}(\mathring{e})$ has finite stabilizer with respect to this $S^1$-action; in fact, the stabilizer is precisely the cyclic group of order $k$! There are examples of Hamiltonian $S^1$-spaces which do not arise as above (i.e. they cannot be extended to a toric action) which also have finite stabilizers. If you take a look at Karshon's classification, these are precisely the points lying on what she calls $\mathbb{Z}_k$-spheres (except for the "north" and "south" poles of the spheres which are fixed points). In all of the above examples, the set of points with finite stabilizer is "small", i.e. it has empty interior. This is always the case for effective Hamiltonian actions by a torus $\mathbb{T}^m$ on a connected symplectic manifold $(M,\omega)$. The fact that $\mathbb{T}^m$ is abelian is crucial in the above statement. If you are interested in the case of this set of points with finite stabiliser being "large", say being open and dense, then a good place to look at is multiplicity-free Hamiltonian spaces, which are the non-abelian analogue of closed symplectic toric manifolds. A good reference is this paper by Knop. 

José, after your last comment, I am pretty sure that you are simply in the presence of a Jacobi structure on a nontrivial line bundle. Most of what I write below is taken from this paper by Crainic and Salazar, called Jacobi structures and Spencer operators. Just for completeness, given a real line bundle $E \to M$, a Jacobi structure on its space of sections $\Gamma(E)$ is a local Lie bracket $[\cdot,\cdot]$ on $\Gamma(E)$, whereby local means that, for any (possibly locally defined) $e_1,e_2 \in \Gamma(E)$, the support of $[e_1,e_2]$ is contained in the intersection of the supports of $e_1$ and $e_2$. These were originally studied by Kirillov (under the name local Lie algebras) and by Lichnerowicz (first under the assumption that the line bundle be trivial). Informally speaking, Jacobi structures are to Poisson structures as contact manifolds are symplectic manifolds (this is a very useful analogy if you are to work with these objects). Just like a Poisson structure on a manifold $M$ induces a Lie algebroid structure on $T^*M$, so does a Jacobi structure on $E \to M$ induce a Lie algebroid structure on $J^1 E$, the first jet bundle of $E \to M$. If I am not mistaken, this was first proven by Dazord and is Proposition 3.4 in Crainic and Salazar's paper. The map $\rho$ that José mentions is simply what Crainic and Salazar call $\rho^1$ in their proof of Proposition 3.4, while the bivector $T_e$ in José's question is $\rho^2(- \otimes e)$ in Crainic and Salazar's language. The relation between the two (which is what José wrote in answer to David's comment) is equation (8) in the paper. The anchor of the Lie algebroid structure on $J^1 E$ is completely determined by $\rho^1$ and $\rho^2$ (this is the content of the first part of the proof of Proposition 3.4 in the paper), so I suspect that José may have just rediscovered this fact! 

It can be shown that $[dW(t)]^\alpha=0$ with $\alpha\in\mathbb{R}$ and $\alpha\ge 3$ generalizing the integer case. Let us consider the stochastic differential equation $dX(t)=[dW(t)]^\alpha$ with $\alpha>0$. We can write the solution in the form $X(t)=X(t_0)+\int_{t_0}^t[dW(t)]^\alpha$ with the integral in the Ito sense. Then, we have to evaluate this integral with the sum \begin{equation} S_n=\sum_{k=1}^n[W(t_k)-W(t_{k-1})]^\alpha. \end{equation} The power of the Brownian process can be evaluated in the following way \begin{equation} [W(t_k)-W(t_{k-1})]^\alpha = [(1+W(t_k)+W(t_{k-1}))-1]^\alpha= \end{equation} \begin{equation} (-1)^\alpha\sum_{l_1=0}^\infty\left(\begin{array}{c} \alpha \\ l_1 \end{array}\right)(-1)^{l_1}(1+W(t_k)+W(t_{k-1}))^{l_1}= \end{equation} \begin{equation} (-1)^\alpha\sum_{l_1=0}^\infty\sum_{l_2=0}^\infty\left(\begin{array}{c} \alpha \\ l_1 \end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}{c} l_1 \\ l_2 \end{array}\right)(-1)^{l_1} [W(t_k)-W(t_{k-1})]^{l_2} \end{equation} provided $|W(t_k)-W(t_{k-1})|<1$. Now, we can use stochastic calculus to remove powers higher than 2 and it is easy to see that \begin{equation} S_n=(-1)^\alpha\sum_{k=1}^n\sum_{l_1=0}^\infty\left(\begin{array}{c} \alpha \\ l_1 \end{array}\right)(-1)^{l_1}- (-1)^\alpha\sum_{l_1=0}^\infty\left(\begin{array}{c} \alpha \\ l_1 \end{array}\right)l_1(-1)^{l_1}\sum_{k=1}^n[W(t_k)-W(t_{k-1})]+ \end{equation} \begin{equation} (-1)^\alpha\sum_{l_1=0}^\infty\left(\begin{array}{c} \alpha \\ l_1 \end{array}\right)\frac{l_1(l_1-1)}{2}(-1)^{l_1} \sum_{k=1}^n[W(t_k)-W(t_{k-1})]^2. \end{equation} So, we have the required expansion with coefficients \begin{eqnarray} \mu_0&=&\sum_{l_1=0}^\infty\left(\begin{array}{c} \alpha \\ l_1 \end{array}\right)(-1)^{l_1} \nonumber \\ \mu_1&=&\sum_{l_1=0}^\infty\left(\begin{array}{c} \alpha \\ l_1 \end{array}\right)l_1(-1)^{l_1} \nonumber \\ \mu_2&=&\sum_{l_1=0}^\infty\left(\begin{array}{c} \alpha \\ l_1 \end{array}\right)\frac{l_1(l_1-1)}{2}(-1)^{l_1} \end{eqnarray} Now we see immediately that $\mu_0=\left.(1-x)^\alpha\right|_{x=1}=0$. Besides, we get immediately the result that, for any real $\alpha\ge 3$, we have again $[dW(t)]^\alpha=0$ as in this case the coefficients are all zero when $\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$ are evaluated thorugh Abel summation. Finally, when $0<\alpha<1$ both the coefficients $\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$ are divergent and maybe no meaning can be attached to them (I have in mind summable divergent series here, any suggestion is greatly appreciated). 

The condition on $g$ gives a definite pde for $A$. This can be seen in the following way. Let us insert the solution $f=A(x,y)e^{ig(x,y)}$ into the Helmholtz equation. We get $$ \Delta A+2i(\partial_xg\partial_xA+\partial_yg\partial_yA)+\Phi(x,y)A=0 $$ being $$ \Phi(x,y)=i\Delta g-(\partial_xg)^2-(\partial_yg)^2+a. $$ Now, assuiming $L$ is a linear operator with the Green function $LG=\delta$, one can write $$ g(x,y)=g_0(x,y)+\int_\Omega dx'dy'G(x,x';y,y')h(x',y') $$ being $Lg_0=0$. By substituting this into $\Phi$ and the equation for $A$ we get a partial differential equation to solve. For some operator $L$, the final equation could be simple to manage but, for the general case, maybe some approximation techniques could help. 

Let us consider the sum $$ m_N(x)=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=0}^{[f(x)]N}\log\left(\frac{cN}{2}-i(2c-1)\right). $$ The first step to get an asymptotic approximation is to extract the leading term in $N$ to obtain $$ m_N(x)=[f(x)]\log N+\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=0}^{[f(x)]N}\log\left(\frac{c}{2}-\frac{i}{N}(2c-1)\right). $$ When $N$ is finite, we recognize a Riemann series and apply the average theorem. So, there exists a value of argument of the logarithm such that $$ m_N(x)=[f(x)]\log N+[f(x)]\log[z(x)]. $$ We can take $z(x)=\frac{c}{2}-t\[f(x)\](2c-1)$ being $t\in (0,1)$. Indeed, we can define a partition with $x_i=x_{i-1}+\frac{1}{\[f(x)\]N}$ and so $$ \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=0}^{[f(x)]N}\log\left(\frac{c}{2}-\frac{i}{N}(2c-1)\right)=[f(x)]\Delta x\sum_{i=0}^{[f(x)]N}\log\left(\frac{c}{2}-i\[f(x)\](2c-1)\Delta x\right) $$ being $\Delta x=\frac{1}{\[f(x)\]N}$. But this, in the given limit, is nothing else than $$ \int_{\frac{c}{2}}^{\frac{c}{2}-\[f(x)\](2c-1)}\log(z)dz<\infty $$ as it should.
