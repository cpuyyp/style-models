I really like Hiro Lee Tanaka's answer. This is just a long comment. The Witten-Reshitkhin-Turaev TQFT needs more data than a three-manifold, or a surface. You can decorate the three-manifolds with a framing, or a $p_1$ structure, and then decorate surfaces with a Lagrangian subspace of their first homology and an integer, and put colors on one manifolds, and the whole thing works... in theory. Actual computations are a bear. The most successful modes of computation descend from coloring surgery diagrams to define morphisms between reduced skein modules as can be found in the seminal paper of Habegger, Masbaum and Vogel on TQFT derived from the Kauffman bracket. Blanchet, C.; Habegger, N.; Masbaum, G.; Vogel, P. Topological quantum field theories derived from the Kauffman bracket. Topology 34 (1995), no. 4, 883â€“927. In practice all the extra data can be accounted for quite elegantly by accepting that the TQFT underlying WRT is four dimensional. I think this idea is due to Kevin Walker. The four dimensional theory is so trivial, that you can account for it with homological data, and hence decategorify the theory to get a less elegant $3$-dimensional TQFT. The ambiguities you are eliminating are in fact just scalar multiplication by a power of the central charge, which is a root of unity. Here is what I think the extension looks like from top down. Choose a level $r$ The Crane-Yetter invariant is assigned to four manifolds. The reduced Kauffman bracket skein module at level $r$ is assigned to three-manifolds. The surface $F$ is assigned the category of left modules over the reduced Kauffman bracket skein algebra of the surface. The morphisms in the category correspond to four dimensional cobordisms. A one manifold is assigned a $2$-category. The objects are relative reduced skein modules of three manifolds, so that there is a disk in the boundary of the three-manifold for each circle in the one manifold, inside of which is an oriented arc that is the boundary of relative skeins. The morphisms come from gluing three manifolds along the complement of the disk, and are induced by including relative skein modules. The two morphisms are given by morphisms between the reduced skein modules induced by surgery diagrams corresponding to the four manifolds. Pretty sketchy. Practically speaking, current interest in quantum invariants is focused on their asymptotic behavior as the level goes to infinity. Generally people are focused on the magnitude of the invariants not the phase, so all the fancy book keeping to keep track of phase to get a three-dimensional theory is wasted effort. 

This is simple if you can draw a picture of your curve. Find a direction so that your tangent is always moving as you pass through it. Count the number of tangents pointing in that direction with a sign. +1 if you are moving through the direction counterclockwise, and -1 if you are moving through the direction clockwise. The sum of the +1's and -1's is your winding number. 

Suppose you want to work with complete flags $\mathbb{F}_3$ on $\mathbb{C}^3$. Given a flag $$ \{0\}\leq V_1\leq V_2 \leq \mathbb{C}^3$$ you can think of $V_1$ as the span of a vector $\vec{u}$, and then you can choose a vector $\vec{v}$ that is Hermitian orthogonal to $\vec{u}$ so that $V_2=<\vec{u},\vec{v}>$. Finally you can choose $\vec{w}$ so that it is Hermitian orthogonal to $<\vec{u},\vec{v}>$. This gives an embedding $$\mathbb{F}_3\rightarrow \mathbb{C}P(2)^3 .$$ Since the Hermitian inner product involves complex conjugates, this embedding cannot possibly be holomorphic. For instance if the first line in homogeneous coordinates is $[a,b,c]$ and the second is $[d,e,f]$ then they satisfy $a\overline{d}=b\overline{e}+c\overline{f}=0$ where the overline indicates complex conjugate. Is there some way of playing around with complex structures to fix this? Is there a similar map, that is better behaved? 

This probably doesn't answer your question, but maybe it is close. The (Extended) Poincare lemma says that if U is a contractible smooth $n$-manifold and $\omega$ is a closed differentiable form meaning $d\omega=0$ then there is a form $\phi$ with $d\phi=\omega$. So, $\phi$ is an antiderivative of $\omega$. More to the point, if $\omega$ is a closed form on the smooth manifold $M$ then $[\omega]\in H^*(M)$, and $\omega$ has an antiderivative if and only if $[\omega]=0$. More specifically, suppose that $M$ is an oriented smooth $n$-manifold so that integration is defined, and $\omega$ is a smooth $n$-form, then $\omega$ has an antiderivative if and only if $\int_M\omega=0$. If $M$ is in addition compact, and $\omega$ is a closed $i$-form then $\omega$ has an antiderivative if and only if for all closed $n-i$ forms $\eta$, $\int_M \omega\wedge \eta=0$. If $\omega$ is not closed it can never have an antiderivative. 

Let $\epsilon$ be an $N$th root of unity, and $q=\epsilon e^h$ where $h<0$. I am trying to give a derivation of the lead term of $$(z;q)_{\infty}=\prod_{n=1}^{\infty}(1-zq^n),$$ as $h\rightarrow 0^-$. From Kashaev and Fadeev's paper on the quantum dilogarithm if $\epsilon=1$ then $$(z;q)_{\infty}\rightarrow\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-z}}e^{\frac{L_2(z)}{h}}(1+O(h)),$$ where $$L_2(z)=\int_0^z\frac{\log{(1-t)}}{t}dt.$$ In Reshetikhin's paper on the Quasitriangularity of Quantum groups at roots of $1$, in Communications in Mathematical Physics, 170, 79-99 (1995), he gets, $$(z;q)_{\infty}\rightarrow e^{\frac{-1}{N^2h}L_2(z^n)}(1-z^N)^{1/2}\prod_{m=0}^N(1-\epsilon^mz)^{\frac{-m}{N}}(1+O(h)).$$ My sense is there should be a direct path from Kashaev and Fadeev's formula to Reshetikhin's formula via the factorization identity for Lobachevsky function. Recall that if $\Lambda(\theta)$ is the Lobachevsky function, and $z=e^{2i\theta}$ then $$2{\bf i}\Lambda(\theta)=L_2(e^{2i\theta})-L_2(1)+\theta(\pi-\theta).$$ The factorization identity, which can be found in chapter 7 of Thurston's notes says, $$\Lambda(N\theta)=\sum_{r\ mod N}N\Lambda(\theta+\frac{\pi r}{N}).$$ My feeling is that you can parse the product $\prod_{n=1}^{\infty}(1-zq^n)$ according to the residue class $r$ of $n$ modulo $N$, to get $$(z;\epsilon e^h)_{\infty}=\prod_{n=1}^{\infty}(1-z(\epsilon e^h)^n)=\prod_{r=0}^{N-1}(\prod_{n=1}^{\infty}(1-z\epsilon^r e^{Nnh+rh}))= \prod_{r=0}^{N-1}(z\epsilon^r e^{hr}; e^{Nh})_{\infty}.$$ Apply the formula for the asymptotics as you got to $1$, and then use the factorization formula to combine the integrals. I get a formula that is close to Reshetikhin's, but I am missing the idea to close it up. Specifically, I can't see where the $\prod_{m=0}^N(1-\epsilon^mz)^{\frac{-m}{N}}$ comes from. Maybe someone who is better at this sort of analysis can just see it?

Let $p:(\tilde{X},y)\rightarrow (X,x) $ be the universal cover of a CW-complex $X$. If $x$ is the only $0$_cell, then every $1$-cell has a unique lift to the universal cover having $y$ as its initial point, and these lifts form a basis for the $1$-chains over the group ring of $\pi_1(X,x)$. The Fox derivative is an axiomatization of the computation of the boundary of a two cell lifted to $\tilde{X}$ so that its initial point in a corresponding relator is $y$. If you have more $0$-cells then the $1$-skeleton gives you information about the fundamental groupoid of $X$ restricted to the points which are the $0$-cells. As you want data about fundamental group, you could choose a maximal tree in the $1$-skeleton of $X$. The generators of $\pi_1(X)$ correspond to the edges of the $1$-skeleton that aren't in the tree. You can associate a relator to each two cell by keeping track of what order, and in what direction its boundary crosses those edges. The Fox Calculus should now work, because you could alternatively collapse the tree to a point, and not change the homotopy type of the $CW$-complex. To compute the first homology of any cover as a module over $\mathbb{Z}$[\pi_1(X)]$ you just need to interpret the answer in the universal cover in the appropriate cover. To effect your general proof of invariance, you just need to produce change of basis matrices corresponding to changing trees, and doing elementary moves on the two complex. To avoid the cell complex use group cohomology. If $M$ is a left $R[G]$-module a crossed homomorphism is a map $\phi:G\rightarrow M$ satisfying $\phi(xy)=\phi(x)+x.\phi(y)$ for any $x,y\in G$. The crossed homomorphisms are an $R$-module. A principle crossed homomorphism is one of the form $\phi(g)=v-g.v$ for some $v\in M$. The quotient of the crossed homomorphisms by the principle homomorphsisms is $H^1(G,M)$. You are interested in this when $G=\pi_1(X)$ and $M=H_1(X)$. Given a presentation of your group, with generators $x_i$ and relators $r_j$, there is a presentation of the crossed homomorphisms, as those crossed homomorphisms on the free group generated by the $x_i$ that annihilate the relators. It can be shown that the space of crossed homomorphisms on the free group are generated as an $R[F(x_i)]$ module by the Fox partial derivatives, and you are off and running, as you are really just interested in calculuating group cohomology. 

There is a gap in the proof that the peripheral ideal is nontrivial in that paper. Thang Le and Stavros came up with a more algebraic way of definining a closely related ideal that they could prove was nontrivial. I think its a great problem. A good starting point might be to prove it for Torus knots. There is a recent paper of Julien Marche that computes the Kauffman bracket skein module of all torus knots, but stop short of understanding the module structure over the skein module of the torus. You might start there. I am willing to conjecture that the peripheral ideal is always nontrivial for any link. In fact, Thang has recently proved a weak form of this. We defined the peripheral ideal to be the extension to the noncommutative torus of the kernel of the inclusion map of skein algebra of the torus into the skein module of the complement of the knot. Via an identification of the skein algebra of the torus with the symmetric part of the noncommutative torus the ideal corresponds to the ideal of the image of the $SL_2\mathbb{C}$-characters of the knot group in the characters of $\mathbb{Z}\times \mathbb{Z}$. We found a way of seeing the colored Jones polynomial of the knot as lying in the dual to the $SL_2\mathbb{C}$-characters of the knot group, and we found that the colored Jones polynomial is in the annihilator of the peripheral ideal. Thang and Stavros stepped back from the picture, and found a formal connection between the Jones polynomial and the noncommutative torus, and then just defined their ideal to be the annihilator of the Jones polynomial. Using formal properties of the $R$-matrix they were able to give an axiomatic proof that their ideal was nontrivial. The conjecture is about the relation between the formal definition of quantum invariants and their concrete realization. The Kauffman bracket skein module of a knot complement is a deformation quantization of the unreduced scheme of the $SL_2\mathbb{C}$-characters of its fundamental group. The conjecture that the peripheral ideal is nontrivial is motivated by this idea, and the fact that the $SL_2\mathbb{C}$-character variety of a nontrivial knot, is nontrivial, meaning the $A$-ideal is nontrivial. This should mean that the peripheral ideal is nontrivial. The orthogonality between the peripheral ideal and the colored Jones polynomial should lead to data about the $SL_2\mathbb{C}$-character variety of the knot being expressed in the aggregate behavior of the colored Jones polynomial of the knot. 

There are exactly two one plane bundles over the circle, the open annulus, and open Moebius band, where we take projection to be onto the central circle. We can now ask what the mod 2 self intersection of the zero section is. In the case of an annulus it is zero, in the case of the Moebius band it is one. The tubular neighborhood theorem says that any smooth submanifold of a smooth manifold has a neighborhood homeomorphic to a k-plane bundle over the submanifold, where k is it's codimension. You can't embed a Moebius band in an orientable surface, so the self intersection of any simple closed curve in an orientable surface is zero. The self intersection number is invariant under homotopy, so if gamma and gamma' are homotopic simple closed curves in a surface that intersect each other transversely then they intersect in an even number of points.

Has anybody done computations of such a theory? Is there a place I could look up and see what the answers are for low crossing knots? 

If $A \in PSL_2(\mathbb{R}$ then $tr^2(A)>4$ means its hyperbolic. There is a unique geodesic in the hyperbolic plane that is invariant under $A$ and $A$ acts a translation along that geodesic. If $tr^2(A)<4$ then $A$ is elliptic. It has a unique fixed point in the hyperbolic plane and it acts as rotation about that fixed point. If $tr^2(A)=4$ then it could be the identity, or it could be parabolic. If it is parabolic it has a unique fixed point on the circle at infinity in the hyperbolic plane. If you put that fixed point at infinity, then it looks like translation $z\rightarrow z+c$ and with scaling you can make that $z\rightarrow z+1$. If you take a quotient of the hyperbolic plane by the group generated by $z+1$ you get an open once punctured disk. You should think of this as an open neighborhood of the point "missing" from the surface. If you have a surface of finite type, that is it is homeomorphic to the result of removing n points from a closed oriented surface, then the space of all conformal structures on that space is larger than the space of all structures with parabolic ends which is larger than the space of structures on the closed surface. Here is an elementary example. The conformal maps from $S^2$ to itself are exactly the group of Mobius transformations. You know a Mobius transformation is determined by where it sends three points. Let $C$ be the space of choices of 4 points from $S^2$. Two choices are equivalent if and only if there is a Mobius transformation taking one to the other. I can choose to send three points to three points, but I have no control of where the $4$th point goes so the space of conformal equivalence classes is one complex, or two real dimensional. 

For genus greater than one, there are lots of Pseudo-Anosov mapping classes that extend over handlebodies, so you can build lots of examples that are not of the types listed above. Here is a specific example: D.D. Long "Pseudo-Anosov maps which extend over two handlebodies" Proceedings of Edinburgh Society(1990) 33, 181-190 There is recent work of Biringer, Johnson, and Minsky characterizing when a power of a pseudo-anosov extends over a handlebody: $URL$

I think there is an obstruction called Van Kampen's obstruction to embedding an $n$-complex into $\mathbb{R}^{2n}$. If you could embed the $n$-complex into $\mathbb{R}^{2n}$ then it has a thickening to a manifold, and that manifold has an intersection pairing in dimension $n$. The obstruction is derived from this pairing. If the complex embeds the obstruction vanishes. For complexes of dimension greater than 2 this suffices, it is not a complete invariant for two complexes. This is worked out in a paper of Krushkal, Freedman, and Teichner and then an example of imcompleteness of the invariant is in a paper of Krushkal. The example given by FKT is of the two skeleton of the six simplex. Of course that example has more than one vertex. If you could embed one vertex $2$-complexes in $\mathbb{R}^4$ then some weird stuff would be happening in that example as you collapse a maximal tree in the one skeleton. The weird thing is that the one skeleton becomes planar. There is a folk theorem that the classification of four manifolds is undecidable because any finitely presented group is the fundamental group of a four manifold. The proof is to embed a two complex with one vertex, whose fundamental group is the chosen finitely presented group into $\mathbb{R}^4$ and take a regular neighborhood. Its gotta be Stallings. :) I would guess that the two questions, one vertex, or planar $1$-skeleton are equivalent. 

Richard's answer captures the essence why there is a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ is in the first homology of a closed nonorientable surface. If you remove a disk from a closed surface, the resulting object has a $1$-dimensional $CW$-complex as a strong deformation retract, so that the homology of the resulting object has no torsion. A closed nonorientable surface is always the result of the connect sum of an orientable surface with a projective plane or two projective planes. That is you are gluing one Moebius band, or two Moebius bands into the boundary of an orientable surface. The core or cores of the Moebius bands, oriented appropriately represent the generator of the $2$-torsion in the first homology of the surface.
