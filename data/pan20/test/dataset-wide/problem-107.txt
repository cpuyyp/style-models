For the purpose of your story, make it whatever you like. Perhaps aliens abducted all the people on cape cod and used them to start a colony - now that colony is 25% gay. 

Imagine the universe as Einstein's trampoline, with each universe being its own trampoline. Go to a point on your trampoline where it's just like the trampoline of your target destination - probably (but not always) a really long way from a gravity well, where both trampolines are almost flat. If there were two identical solar systems, you might be able to do it in a gravity well. Blast off a shitload of energy. Like, infinite heat levels of energy, where the rules of physics start to get really weird. You can punch a hole through your trampoline and their trampoline. You can even cauterizing the edges to keep it open. Now you can travel between universes. 

above ~70 km/s an impact causes any material being hit to vaporize (literally converted into a gas), this creates a secondary pressure wave thus creating an explosion just as detonating an explosive like TNT does. In thicker materials it creates an accompanying crater as the partially and completely molten material further away from the impact point is pushed out of the way by the pressure wave. There is quite a bit of wiggle room depending on the masses and materials in question. Some estimates say this can occur in rock at as little as 20km/s. At lower velocities the impact forces just creates a spray of molten material pushed away by the inertial forces creating a crater but not a real explosion. $URL$ 

With enough money, anything is possible, but no, I don't think we could slow-boat by 2200. It just isn't enough time to figure out how to live in space. In your model, we have been cruising around Sol for 170 years. Any trip to a neighboring system would take longer - perhaps a lot longer, depending on where the next habitable planet is. There are just so many things that could go wrong - problems we don't even think to anticipate. The hard part, in my opinion, is the ecology of a colony ship: Creating an ecosystem capable of safely supporting a human community for hundreds of years without any outside input. Can it be done? Absolutely. Would I step onto one of these ecosystems unless they were already a proven technology, perfected in orbit around Sol? Hell no! Then what do you do when you get there? We have never colonized another planet before. We need to be prepared for it to go wrong, or even to walk away from the planet and come back to Sol. 

Nothing unless you know where you are or are willing to play long odds. Basically unless you have satellites to map the planet you are going to be guessing with extremely long odds. Even with satellites your still going to have problems. And even then your only option (besides the satellites themselves) is stone carving. Your real issue is you have no idea where anything ise or if the thing you are looking at is going to be a fossil or not. Out of millions of dead t-rexs only a handful ever fossilized and only a handful of those were ever found. metals will not survive, (corrosion, dissolving, ect) and would be prone to collection and use in tools in early history if they did. paint has even less chance, stone carvings placed in a depositional environment is it. If you know where you are your best bet is to find the solnhofen reef/lagoon system in germany, carve a thousand copies on stone tablets (don't use local stone) build a raft and then drop them all over the place in the lagoons. Lots of copies or just lots of notes is your best bet, just make lots of tablets and drop them in any depositional environment you find and you increase the chances that some will be found, but it is still long odds you don't know what is going to be eroded away or not be exposed. 

Water currents - eh. Air currents, absolutely. Manipulating air temperature also manipulates air pressure: aka wind. A constant warmer + lower pressure zone of air would keep the sails full. 

It did survive. There are Catholics in the UK. The protestant/catholic fighting was regional and cultural as much as it was religious. Polygamous societies cannot compete with monogamous ones. Poly societies under-utilize their male workforce, since so many of them fight/exploit each other for a chance to reproduce. They always end up with a horde of angry, virgin men, and you can't always dump them onto the EU, if you know what I mean. There were a great many criticisms of Catholicism. At its core, the mysticism - conducting religion in a language that your flock cannot understand, was the big complaint. The Church of England is very similar to Catholicism in terms of ideas. They broke away so that they could stop taking orders from the Vatican, and so that they could study the bible in their native tongue. If the European aristocracy had gone poly, it would have hastened the revolutions that killed off so many of them, and no way would it have delayed the enlightenment. 

An artificial sky is a great idea, psychologically being able to see the sky is a big deal, especially on the span of years or more. How to do it better 1. If they paint the ceiling with semi-reflective blue paint it will save a lot of energy, and make engineering easier since they can use multiple diffuse light sources for most of the sky (everything but the sun). You don't need to see the sun all the time, a brightly lit blue sky is more important. Of course you can still have a projected sun and stars. Just having bare aluminum is just asking for corrosion issues. Clouds. clouds are not necessary but if you want them their are two ways to achieve it. In a large dome clouds may form naturally, if not cloud machines are a thing. 2. Alternatively if you have tunnels instead of a dome, you can put fake sky lights in the rooms. these can be painted surfaces or low resolution screens. This may a be a good idead in out buildings or larger buildings anyway. 

'Aint no animals that are immune to bullets. I'd imagine they would try and catch him in a musket volley. Even if he can survive a gunshot, or even a few gunshots, he'll go down if you put enough lead into him. They could get him with a cleverly placed barrel of gunpowder, too. Alternatively, does the old world have its own magic? They could send some witch hunters after him. The hard part would be compelling the shaman to stand his ground. If things are starting to look bad, it seems like he would have an easy time disengaging. 

I always think of them as isotopes with such a large difference in neutrons that they have different chemical properties. The fact that these things aren't conceivable under our current understanding of physics is kind of the point. We have no idea how it got there and no idea how to make it. That's why it's rare, and that's why we have to go to that planet to get it. Maybe it was left over from the previous big bang, or from another universe entirely. Maybe Q put it there just to f*ck with us. So much of the universe's mass is unaccounted for. There's only protons, neutrons and electrons around this neighborhood, but who knows what's really out there? 

it is not meant as a weapon. the heating is for cutting some kind of packaging that needs to be heat sealed as you cut, perhaps the new super armor has a liquid core that leaks after it takes a hit but can be heat sealed shut. use as as weapon would be an afterthought. or maybe it is for removing armor from the injured and you need a hot knife to cut the new armor, kevlar can be cut with scissors maybe the new stuff is not so easy. pure psychological, it makes for a crappy weapon but it is scary as all hell, designs like this have happened before. it would be abandoned fairly quickly but some diehards might still have one. 

Cocaine /end thread. They could do it ethically by bypassing the cartels entirely. Farm to glass table, if you will. The growers in S. America make more money and nobody gets killed. Asteroid Mining With a good telescope and a stolen/borrowed space suit, they could pop into space, grab a chunk of iridium and be home in time for lunch. They would make way more than 10 million. Tuna Fishing A fresh Tuna is worth thousands. These guys can deliver them still-wriggling. Without the stress of being caught, their tuna might taste the best, too. EMT's They could respond to medical emergencies instantaneously. Anyone who gets injured could be in the ER in the time it takes to forward a phone call. This would save an awful lot of lives. In health care, there's this thing called 'The Golden Hour', where, if they can get you in front of the doctor in less than an hour, your chances of survival are astronomically higher. Teleporters could get all their patients to the ER inside that golden hour, saving lots of lives and making boatloads of cash while they are at it. An ambulance ride costs around 10,000, and teleporting is better, so they could charge more. Ohh... you said secretly. That makes it harder... 

The cams could easily be made of metal, and that's the only thing made of modern materials. They will not be common however, they would cost a fortune and they don't offer any real advantage over a crossbow and can't be made super compact like the modern ones. 

why don't modern militaries train troops on shield walls and melee, because modern technology has made melee largely irrelevant. Ground troops have to get to the ground, if you have a decent space defense force that will never happen. So most of your ground troops are only for dealing with local rebellions or as a last ditch defense force. You might have a few other elite specialists for stealth missions but that is going to add up to a very small proportion of your troops. It is much the same reason an island nation might put a lot more effort into naval/air defense than ground troops. Ground forces don't matter if you can keep them from ever reaching the ground, so defenders will put as much as they can into space defense and the attackers will do likewise. You also have the issue that you need a much larger force to cover space space since it is a 3 dimensional battlefield, there are no defensive lines, only defensive spheres that adds up to a lot more assets.
