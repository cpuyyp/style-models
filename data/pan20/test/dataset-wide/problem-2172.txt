Convicted rapists should be punished, by laws and yourself. You have the responsibility to enforce workplace safety. Please inform everybody (especially female coworkers) in the company about the criminal. Consider to send an email to the everybody in the company like: 

From the company perspective, you have nothing exciting to offer thus your salary should be lower than a new potential intelligent junior developer. You shouldn't be sad but take it as an opportunity. Now, you know there is someone in your team understand software development better than you. You can learn from the new developer and absorb the new skills into your your works. 

PhD hurts your job seeking. It's a shame to add it to a non-academic resume, so don't do that. You're not legally required to tell anybody about your PhD degree. Everybody does that. In the industry, nobody cares if you have a PhD title (they care if you have criminal records). It won't show up in background check because nobody cares. 

He would always say that its just some lines of code and once integration testing is successful then its good for Production. Sure enough, a fix we deployed with minimal analysis and testig affected a lot of downstream systems and, of course, i had to fix it. This has happened every time we have a meeting to the point we're already arguing because I am trying to convince him that these changes require a bit more analysis and testing, but he keeps on saying i'm taking too long and over-analyzing things. I believe that quality and efficient code take a bit more longer to write and test. It seems its been the company culture wherein they don't adhere to IT standards and policies (My Manager violates IT policies and does not adhere to Standard Practices). Is this something I should escalate? And what better approach can I take to convince him that these types of changes need more time to analyze and test? 

This is the key point of this question. The people on the other end are essentially asking "is it worth going to all this trouble?" You are being asked to give a verbal acceptance to a non-binding, poorly-specified verbal offer. 

Who are you talking to? Senior management? The team that you'll be working with? This can drive the formality vs. chatty style of your presentation. What's the venue? Big room vs. small room, do you need a pointer or can you just point to a screen to make a point? How many people? If it's a huge room (and I doubt it is), you might need to wear a microphone to be heard in the back. What's the technology for the presentation? Powerpoint? Mac vs. PC? Are you handing them a disk of slides? Will you be clicking next page or will someone else be advancing the slides? Will you have some setup time before the presentation? You're going to be nervous so take as much time as they offer to get all the technical ducks in a row. Make it clear that you cannot present any sensitive information from current or prior employers. That will come as no surprise but it's a level of maturity that not all candidates will show. 

I'm concerned that the same thing will happen on the 18th, until it will just be forgotten or cancelled. Notes: 

I've even given him demonstrations and suggestions on how best practices will positively impact our work but he turns a blind eye on it. What's the best way or are there other ways I can convince him to adhere to Standard Practices not to violate IT policies? 

After some hours, still got no response so I reached out to him over Skype and we finally talked about it. Basically the gist was: 

With this, I decided to look for a new job and was immediately offered an Associate Manager (AM) position with my former company ("ACN"). I handed in my resignation, but my new Manager ("RV") worked out a counter-offer: A promotion to Team Lead and slightly better compensation than the offered AM position in ACN. After some thoughtful consideration, I decided to stay because I needed the money more than the AM position. After waiting some days, I still didn't get a formal letter or email, so I decide to write it myself, confirming my acceptance to the promotion with the salary increase, and the effective date: 

We can't do this to experienced financial practitioners because they are competitive and highly employable. For your friend - Pay or never step into finance. 

Sorry, working overtime in highly competitive places like Singapore is very common. You are not alone as many Asian cities like Hong Kong, South Korea and Japan are like that. There is nothing suspicious in your question. Working until the next day is not unusual, something that the Europeans here don’t understand. It’s part of the Asian working culture. You are expected to work as long as your body can physical capable of. It will get better once you move into more senior position. Unfortunately, if you don’t obey you are not considered as employable. For your records, my Asian friends would frequently work until 3 or 4 am just before the deadline. Your situation is not as bad as you might think. The Singapore law allows you to say NO. You don’t have to work overtime if you really insist. But ... prepare for pressure, revenge and anger from your team as you're breaking the working culture and trust. It’s bad if you are the only one leaving home early when the whole team stay late. Again, working late is absolutely expected in Asia. Choose: 

To which they responded and acknowledged via Email, thanking me of my decision to stay. Fast forward two weeks later, March 7th, I was informed that the promotion will be delayed to March 18 due to complications in the process. Apparently, no one knows what to submit and who to submit it to and everyone is pointing fingers at one another. My questions would be: 

And many more other reasons. Fortunately, as noted in the 2nd link above, I will be transferred to a new Organization, which means I will effectively be under a new Manager ("RV"). I expected that normal protocol would dictate that MM would consult RV first before delegating any task to me, however, MM still directly assigns tasks to me. I talked about this to "RV", and RV recommneded that I oblige MM's requests for the time being since they were still "in transision". RV and I both agreed that I just include in emails and calls so she's aware. However, One time, MM suddenly called over Skype, asking me to take on an impromptu, urgent project. Before responding, I told MM that I will just pull RV into the call, but he said: 

As an employee, your works are property of the company. It's nice if you could add your name onto the paper, but the company doesn't have any obligation. Unless the company defaulted on paying you, you have no control over your company's assets. It's not your paper, you were paid to work on it. It's like a programmer being hired for writing code. Good job for your works on the publication, but that doesn't mean you deserve any credits other than what already stated in your employment contract (e.g. salary). Please don't do anything silly. Your behaviour is close to stealing company's assets. Don't go into that. No, you shouldn't ask for your name because it’s not your paper. 

There's no conflict. You sign the upcoming contract. If you have a new offer from another company, you will sign it as well, and then terminate the first contract. If they don't let you do this, you make troubles on your first day for your first job, they will have no choice but to terminate you on the day. You might also get one week termination payment for your probation. Check your contract. Either you terminate your first job or you make them terminate you. Now, you can start your second job. 

In short, I think you've passed damage control and are now presented with options for the future. You have the credibility and flexibility to plan for the future. Do so and reap the benefits! 

None. There shouldn't be a need for any action at all. Their role on one Board should be entirely separate from the other. Anything else would be a conflict of interest. 

New guy: you feel like things are going great with your current team(s) and processes. Now, imagine hiring a totally new person onto the team. How quickly could you bring them up to speed? Could you summarize the high points of what your team does in a single sheet of paper that a person with no background could understand in five minutes? How long did it take to integrate the last new hire? Could you decrease that time by 50%? Motivation: until a new hire is integrated and productive, they are a cost to the organization. You are saving future money by thinking this way. Hit by a bus: who is your critical team member? What happens when they get hit by a bus tomorrow? Or you can imagine that they quit with no notice if that's a little less grim. Who takes over their tasks? How does that cascade throughout the team? What projects will be at risk? Motivation: plan for disaster now to avoid future cost. Double in size: what if your team suddenly doubled in size? It sounds like you're doing great with the people that you have. It's entirely likely that senior management will say "this is a good manager, let's give them more to manage!" Could you absorb a whole pile of people who, quite likely, are not up to your current standards of process and skillset? Motivation: plan for promotion. Halve in size: what if the economy hits harder than expected and you lose half of your people but maintain the same workload? What would you have to trim to get the critical work done? Can you negotiate schedules? How about requirements? This could also happen as a result of your work: your great team members get promoted to bigger and better things. Motivation: cutting my team improved efficiency! Please feel free to give me some of the increased profits as a bonus! 

You might feel uncomfortable for the discussion but that is really none of your business. The point of the employment for you is to make money and contribute the society. As long as the business is solid and profitable, there is nothing you should do. 

I have no idea of your background, because it all depends on your skill sets and your bargaining power. In academics (e.g. computer scientist at PhD level), visa sponsorship is awfully common. That make sense because the job is really not something that everybody can do. In IT, you will need have very strong background history to convince visa sponsorship. UK, France, Germany and Australia have enough candidates for entry to middle level positions. You will need to prove yourself (more likely a senior position). If you did have the skills set, consider headhunters. Headhunters work with top clients (e.g. investment banking), those companies will more than happy to sponsor you if they believe you are unique. Answer You are free to ask for visa sponorship for any job position that you are qualfiied. However, expect rejection unless you have strong unique skills not available in the local market. 

But since the new Director ("CC") in Org X is a new employee and doesn't really know who I am and what I do / have done, I asked MM for an endorsement to him instead, to which he responded: 

I'm working as an offshore Senior ERP Developer with a BPO Company for over a year now and my Manager and peers are working in the United States. I've been successfully been taking on large projects and, in my opinion, I was able to do a lot for the company in a year From my past working experience, there has always been an annual performance appraisal and I wanted to know how I am doing as an Employee. (Please note that the company didn't provide me with an Orientation). And based on our ERP system (which i have access to), i am scheduled to have an appraisal. With that, I reached out to my Manager via Email (Titled "Career Progression for ____ " and asked:
