$URL$ Even if only a small percentage of those traditional rulers should be considered kings, that still increases the number of kings at the present significantly. In medieval Ireland, there were many small polities called Tuaths. The ruler of a Tuath was called a Ri, or king. Thus there were an unspecified number of kings and kingdoms in medieval Ireland - I have read 90 kingdoms, and 150 kingdoms in another source, so I wonder if anyone has a complete list. Wikipedia lists about 57 kingdoms in the "early Christian" period. $URL$ The Island of Ireland has an area of 84,421 square kilometers or 32,595 square miles. The population of medieval Ireland at various times may have varied from about 500,000 to about 1,000,000. So if there were about 50 to 200 kingdoms at any one time in medieval Ireland the average kingdom would have had an average area of about 422.105 to 1,688.42 square kilometers, or about 162.975 to 651.9 square miles, and an average population of about 2,500 to 20,000 people. So average medieval Irish kingdoms might be bigger than Barbados and smaller than Coromos, with populations larger than the Vatican City and smaller than San Marino. Some kings were overlords of other tuaths besides their own. A common title for them was Ruiri or over king. They could be called second level kings or kings of kings, but many Christians have a strange reluctance to use the title of king of kings. Ireland was always divided into areas that are called provinces in English, but were called "fifths" in medieval Gaelic. Due to the ambitions of kings, there were often more than five fifths in medieval Ireland. The king of a fifth, or province, was the overlord of all kings and overkings in his fifth, and was often called a Ri ruirech or king of overkings. It would be logical to call a Ri ruirech a third level king or a king of kings of kings. And for centuries there was a high king of all Ireland or Ard ri. It would be logical to call the Ard ri a fourth level king, or a king of kings of kings of kings, instead. $URL$ And some medieval Irish writers claimed that the High King was subordinate to the Holy Roman Emperor, thus making the emperor equivalent to a fifth level king or a king of king of kings of kings of kings. The ancient Roman republic and empire had many kingdoms under its authority at various times. Tiberius Claudius Cogidubnus was a client king in southern Britain after the Roman conquest in 43 AD. A fragmentary inscription was reconstructed as giving Cogidubnus the title of King and Imperial Legate in Britain, but it is now reconstructed to give him the title of Great King of the Britons, the rank of great king being justified by the emperor granting him lands outside his original kingdom to rule, according to one theory. Thus we see that not just kings but great kings could be clients of the Roman Empire. King Tigranes II The Great of Armenia conquered many neighboring lands and proclaimed himself King of Kings about 85 BC. After being defeated in 68-66 BC by Lucullus and Pompey the Great, Tigranes became a client of the roman republic. I believe that Tigranes II and his son Artavasdes II continued to use the title of of King of kings until 34 BC, which would make the Roman consuls in that period the republican equivalents of third level kings or kings of kings of kings. I am not sure what titles were used by succeeding Armenian monarchs, king, great king, or king of kings. Most of the later Armenian monarchs were subordinate to either Rome, or Persia, or sometimes to both at once. In 36 and 34 BC the Roman Triumvir Mark Anthony granted many lands to Queen Cleopatra of Egypt. In the Donations of Alexandria in 34 BC Mark Anthony proclaimed Cleopatra and her son Caesarion, the queen and king of Egypt, Queen of Kings and King of Kings. Mark Anthony made his young children with Cleopatra monarchs. Anthony appointed Alexander Helios King of Armenia, Media, and (unconquered) Parthia, his twin Cleopatra Selene II Queen of Cyrenaica and Libya, and Ptolemy Philadelphus King of Syria and Cilicia. Thus Mark Anthony showed that a Roman triumvir had authority to appoint kings and kings of kings, and thus was equivalent to at least a third level king or a king of kings of kings. But since the Parthian monarchs were now using the title of king of kings, it is possible that Mark Anthony might have promoted Alexander Helios to King of Kings when and if Parthia was conquered. If Cleopatra remained the overlord of Alexander Helios that would in turn make her the equivalent of a third level queen, a queen of kings of kings, and that in turn would have made Mark Anthony at least as high as a fourth level king or a king of kings of kings of kings. The Borsporan Kingdom, founded in about 480 BC, became a roman client state at lest as early as 8 BC, and lasted until AD 341 or later, before being conquered by the Huns. It ruled parts of the Crimea and the area around the Sea of Azov. Theodore Momensen, in The Provinces of the Roman Empire 1885, 1886, stated that one of the Bosporan kings, a client of the Roman Empire, used the title of king of kings. Septimius Odaenathus was made the ras (lord) of Palmyra, a city state in the Roman Province of Syria, in the 240s. In 252 Persian King of Kings Sapor I began a long series of invasions of Roman provinces. In 260 Sapor defeated and captured Emperor Valerian at Edessa and raided the eastern provinces. Fulvius Macrianus proclaimed himself and his sons Quietus and Macrianus Minor emperors and sought to overthrow emperor Gallienus, son of Valerian. Odaenathus may have been proclaimed king of Palmyra at this time. Odaenathus defeated Sapor and drove him out of Roman territory. Gallienus defeated and killed Macrianus and Macrianus Minor in a battle in the Balkans. Odaenatus then defeated Quietus and his followers and took control over much of the eastern provinces, and was rewarded by Gallienus with titles and honors. In 263 Odaenatus took the title of King of Kings of the East and had his son Hairan I crowned co-King of Kings. 

Possibly astronomers discover the mouth of a stable wormhole in the direction the solar system is headed toward. They calculate that most objects in the solar system will pass by the mouth of the wormhole. But Earth, and maybe also the moon, will pass through the wormhole mouth and leave the solar system. If astronomers can see through the wormhole mouth they can have some idea of what is in the area of space Earth is headed for, otherwise they will have no idea. No doubt many will speculate that the wormhole is artificial, created by alien super science to take Earth out of the solar system. 

If you want both of the stars to appear as sun like discs in the sky of a habitable planet, it is best to have the planet orbit both stars. If you want both of the stars to appear with almost exactly the same apparent diameter in the sky of the planet, true twin suns, then the planet almost certainly has to orbit around both of the stars. In a few cases of planets that orbit one of the stars and not the other in double star system, it may be possible for the two stars to have the right diameters and distances to sometimes line up so that they look about the same size in the sky of the planet for a short period of time, maybe a few percent of the total time it takes for the two stars to orbit each other, which can be many Earth years. In your System A), a circumbinary or P-type system, where the planet orbits around the two stars, the planet will have to orbit at least 2 to 4 times the distance between the two stars. Both of the stars should appear as discs in the sky of the planet. As the two stars orbit around each other first the bright one would eclipse the dimmer one and then the dimmer one would eclipse the brighter one. And most of the time the two stars would be between eclipses and appear side by side in the sky. It is quite possible for the two stars to be separated by ten or twenty times their diameters, for example, and the planet to orbit at a distance of about 100 times the diameters of the two stars. Thus the two stars would appear clearly separated most of the time. Your saying that the two stars would appear as one bright point in the sky in system A) is incorrect. A planet would have to orbit a type O supergiant or something for it's star to appear as a point of light in the sky at a habitable distance. And it is impossible for a type O supergiant star to have a habitable planet anyway, so that doesn't count. As for your system B), which is called a S-type orbit, the farther star will not be much father away when it is on the opposite site of the nearer star than when it is on the closer side of the nearer star. Suppose that the two stars have almost circular orbits around each other that are ten times the distance of the planet's orbit around the nearer star (Which is a bit farther than the minimum separation needed for stable planetary orbits. Thus the distance from the planet will vary between 9 times and 11 times the distances of the nearer star from the planet. If the two stars have exactly the same diameter and brightness (and of course they do not have to), the farther star will seem to have between 0.0909 and 0.1111 the diameter of the closer star, and will be be between 0.0082 and 0.0123 times the brightness of the closer star. Suppose that the two stars have almost circular orbits around each other that are 100 times the distance of the planet's orbit around the nearer star. Thus the distance from the planet will vary between 99 times and 101 times the distances of the nearer star from the planet. If the two stars have exactly the same diameter and brightness (and of course they do not have to), the farther star will seem to have between 0.0099 and 0.0101 the diameter of the closer star, and will be be between 0.000102 and 0.000098 times the brightness of the closer star. Note that on Earth the full moon is only 0.00000025 times as bright as the Sun, so if the farther star appeared only 0.000098 times as bright as the nearer star it would still be many times as bright as the full moon on Earth and easily visible in daylight on the planet Thus if the two stars have almost circular orbits around their common center of mass, instead of highly elliptical ones, the apparent diameter and apparent brightness of the farther star will not vary by very much. Your worry about the planet's orbit taking it much farther away from the farther star is not scientifically valid. The big problem with your system B) with a habitable planet in a S-type orbit around only one of the stars, would be getting the two different stars to appear to have the same angular diameter and the same apparent brightness as seen from the habitable planet. In your system type A), with the habitable planet in a P-type orbit around both the stars, both of the stars will be about the same distance from the habitable planet all the time. Thus the apparent diameter and the apparent brightness of both of the stars will have the same ratio as seen from the habitable planet as they actually have. So if the two stars happen to have almost identical actual size and luminosity they will appear to have almost identical apparent size and luminosity as seen from the habitable planet. But in your system type B) with the habitable planet orbiting in a S-type orbit around only one of the stars, the farther star will have to be at least several times farther from the planet than the star the planet orbits. Thus if you don't need the two stars to have the same apparent diameter and the same apparent brightness as seen from the habitable planet, there is no problem. There are plenty of possible configurations that will have the farther star have a smaller apparent diameter as seen from the habitable planet, and also a much less apparent brightness, while still shining brighter than any star in Earth's sky or even the full moon. But if you want the two stars in your system type B), with the habitable planet orbiting in a S-type orbit around only one of the stars, to appear to have the same diameter and the same luminosity as seen from the habitable planet, you will have a problem because one of the stars will have to be at least several times as far away as the other star. In that situation it will be difficult to have the farther star appear to have the same apparent size as the nearer star as seen from the habitable planet, and it will be difficult to have the farther star appear to have the same brightness as the nearer star as seen from the habitable planet, and it will be just about impossible to have both. You might be able to make the apparent size match, and you might be able to make the apparent brightness match, but it would be almost impossible to make both match. If there is a habitable planet in your solar system, you will want both of the stars in your system to be main sequence stars. The size and brightness of main sequence stars depend on their masses. And if you change the mass of a main sequence star the size and the luminosity will change according to different formulas. You can never get the size and the luminosity to change in the same amount, so that the farther star will have both the necessary actual size and the necessary actual brightness to have the same apparent size and the same apparent brightness as seen from the habitable planet. So in your system type B) with the habitable planet orbiting in a S-type orbit around only one of the stars, you will have to settle for noticeable differences in the apparent diameter and apparent brightness of the two stars as seen from the habitable planet.
