With these in mind, together with the assumption that the magnetic charge of a monopole is directly propotional to its mass, then theoretically, magnetic equivalents of nucleons and electrons (called magnuclei and magtrons respectively) can stably exist as magatoms. Magatoms, having large charges, will typically have larger masses and also greater internal attraction-repulsion forces, therefore making them extremely dense, but also extremely strong materials. A magatom may be imagined as a big north pole orbited by small south poles. 

Source Based on the image, I can deduce that strong lasers are concentrated into the target chamber, generating enough power to "rip spacetime". This results to the energy being dissipated as a stream of radiation and virtual particles transferring their momenta into the ship. That stream is magnetically directed towards the back part of the ship to create thrust. 

Consider a smallish cube, self powered and capable of projecting interactive holograms. If your far-future race communicates verbally, the cube would be equipped with a language-learning routine, so it would learn the language of the future rather than the inverse. Holographic projection would first allow picto-graph type communication until the cube learned the language and then it could begin to communicate verbally. Preserve it inside one of those molybdenum aluminum boride mononiths (thanks to Pommerbot for the science!) and make it a "quest" to get inside the monolith with all the associated rewards of solving the quest. 

If you have 4 or 5 genders you may have reproduction that requires something more complicated than a gamete-based method. For example, you could use role types versus gender types and there could group responsibility for nurturing the offspring until its capable of surviving on its own. For the reproduction part, you would need gene-contributors (what humans would call egg and sperm donors) and you might need more than one of them due to something that would cause certain combinations to be successful and other to not be successful - and then perhaps you would need a "quickener" - a member of the reproductive group that contributes an energy that takes the gene contributions and makes them combine to form the proto-being. Lastly if these beings carry unborn offspring inside their bodies you would need an incubator. All of these factors taken together may result in a litter of offspring rather than one single offspring per reproductive cycle. 

Apart from that, magmatter can also collapse into a blackhole if magatoms are oriented too close together, making strings, sheets, and hollow objects of magmatter the most practical structures. 

And here's a size comparison between a magmatter nanotube (the tiny blue line on the lower left) and a classical carbon nanotube. 

Organized Synesthesia is the biological version of multimedia arts. Within the brain, synesthesia occurs as an interpretation of sensory data from a sense organ that is somehow associated with a type of sensory data from a different sense organ. The idea of hearing smells and tasting emotions probably leads to disorganized thoughts, but enhances the synesthete's pattern recognition abilities. But by making the recognizable patterns available for correlation to consequently develop entirely new "meta-senses" arising from those correlations, maybe we can re-organize thoughts even better. The simplest example I could give would be a sensory ability made for sentient photosynthetic organisms, designed to find the optimal light settings to have enjoyable meals with maximum nutritional value. Simply put, a creature can taste the rainbow and the sunlight by having: 

Humanoids living and walking along the bottom of an earth-like planet would have to put up with extreme pressure, wouldn't they? So, first of all they'd probably be shaped differently - shorter, squatter, beefy-er, etc. Their bone structure would likely be more dense. Given that they could breathe air, they might find walking on the surface of the earth a little like flying - definitely liberating. 

In one possible scenario you'll need three elements. 1) A launcher of some type on a orbital platform 2) the Clarke elevator/skyhook to get to the orbital platform and 3) a wormhole network Take the Clarke elevator to the orbital platform, board a launch pod, launch pod is loaded into a launcher and sent through a wormhole to its destination. Of course if the launcher can get the pod up to FTL speed, you might not need the wormholes. 

Simply put, this creature is engineered to be an interstellar steed, with enough reason to use insane amounts of power to sustain equally insane metabolic pathways. 

For the locomotor skills you required, I'd say the human body plan is enough, albeit with slightly longer arms and three-jointed legs for quadrupedal motion, a prehensile tail for high-speed maneuvers, an opposable toe for each foot, and a highly flexible membrane connecting the forearms, hips, and forelegs for gliding and rolling. The creature would like a cross between a monkey, a flying squirrel, and a cat. Momo from Avatar:TLA would be the closest creature, minus the oversized ears. 

I imagine a creature engineered to metabolize and synthesize its own magmatter and reinforce its normal matter composition, having delicate electromagnet organs to hold and move around its magmatter components. This biological makeup of hybrid matter should be ideal for: - magnetically suspending a blackhole inside its body, - structurally supporting its other body parts against the effects of gravitation, and - creating armor for protecting against space debris Furthermore, it can have finely controlled mirrors, lenses, skeletal muscles, and photosynthetic cells supported with magmatter, surrounding the blackhole for it to either sustain the blackhole by feeding it with its own radiation or extract some of its energy to sustain other metabolic pathways. 

Communist can not became a strong alternative to capitalism. Opposite is true (to dislike for many people) for numerous reasons: 

Hand made. Even today, hand made stuff sells well even when industrially made alternatives are much cheaper while maintaining same (or even higher) quality. Copying won't help, no one wants precise copy of paintings for price any close to original's. even if you could copy Mona Lisa on atomic level, making it exactly same, people would still want original more. "When you want to show a status and class you simply have to have that original handmade piece" This is not something that would apply to say, electronic, but it does and will apply to jewellery more that to anything else. Add to it a factor of maker's name as brand (eg. when you can afford it, you don't want just any hand made, but hand made by XYZ), and you can be certain this will be around as long as humanity will exist. 

What is the purpose / significance of the symbols in the eye? Identification, differentiation? Where would they get the idea in the first place? Maybe someone born with a genetic mutation? 1. maybe that mutation indicates they're from the ruling family - in this case the poser (person with fake lenses) has the potential of gain. 

On intake, implant inmates with a tracking chip which is multifunctional. The chip also "receives" a paralysis field that is broadcast across the prison and its grounds at 2200hrs. This field can also be attributed to the zero jailbreak record of the prison, because it can be turned on manually as well as being set for automatic-on state at 2200hrs. Something to think about is - if this practice becomes widely known will it have an adverse effect on the political ambitions of Ytra? 

The four topics I discussed are more tightly related than I may have discussed them, but the simple premise is that language, thought, and perception will merge into a single concept. If the answer is yes and a convention for mixed sensations will indeed provide people with the privilege to broadcast the entirety of themselves, what would become of such a society? But if no, and allowing ourselves to consciously develop mixed sensations and be able to communicate them more efficiently still cannot allow us to completely and truly understand one another, then what can? 

Noumenal Conveyance Noumenon is the opposite of phenomenon. It is a thing as itself, an object's fundamental existence as opposed to a thing as represented by other things. If somehow, other sensory perceptions, correlations, and interpretations, are heightened and integrated altogether as to build a comprehensive copy of reality within the mind, wouldn't that create noumena out of raw phenomena? Likewise, a multimedia communication system that involves recreating the noumena by exhibiting all their constituent phenomena should be possible as well. A thing-as-itself can be made communicable by integrating and exhibiting the thing-as-it-appears from different sensory perspectives 

When dealing with a collective consciousness of any type the best weapon is logic. Think of those ancient Star Trek episodes where Spock presents a paradoxical conundrum to a computer about its behavior and it bricks (after a lot of rattling and smoking). You could do the same to the ants, we're assuming they can communicate and that they're either following the edicts of their queen or some sort of ruling council or quorum. So what argument can you present to the collective consciousness that would show that it needs to stop attacking the terraformers because they are providing something that would help the ant-hill thrive - even while they have some sort of imperative to attack the terraformers. "Must attack humans, but humans give us "x" with the terraforming, must have "X", but must attack humans...." Eventually the ant-hills break down and become just a bunch of regular ants which are good for the terraforming process. 

To me it seems that fixed-cartridge would be by practical means same as removable-cartridge with single cartridge that user never removes. That mean that it has advantages and no disadvantage. (Advantages are for example shooting more then 15 shots; especial for training or sport-shooting would be "15 shots and 15 min wait" crippling) 

It depends on life-span and breeding speed. (as well as "evolution speed" that might be different for aliens) It is more question of generations. About 40 generations should make it. 

Effects concerned (ability to communicate) would be very low. HOW IT COULD NOT SUCCEED: 1) It would not affect people. Professionals all around the world are keeping up with their respective fields more o less. Technology concerning, only latest research (5 years, 15 max) could be lost. Also keep in mind that research papers are usually literary kept as papers in university libraries. 2) if it would not affect turned off computers, technological impact would be even less. In all filed you have thousands of students caring their laptops filed with latest knowledge. chances that some of them would have their laptops turned off at time of attack are close to certainty. HOW IT COULD SUCCEED: 1) however, it would greatly impact out 'organization'. Databases of people, logistic databases etc. You would lose all kinds of data from lent books in library to who has access to security facilities. Everybody would know who is president without Wikipedia, but let's take Universities, you know don't know who are students, what marks they had, You would also lose most digital contracts, etc.. Minor a occasionally major social chaos would occur, and that could escalate into conflicts. 2) it would stop us for a while. Top scientist could not continue their researches further, but would need to focus on restoring our knowledge bases from their memories and fragments of surviving data. Put together with 1) it would mean we would be stuck for a while. SUMMARY: It has little to no chance to make us unable to communicate technologically, but it could realistically succeed by enduring chaos a making us unable to cooperate on answer. 

maybe that mutation is just the most outward indicator of a suite of mutations that includes a superpower - in this case the poser puts himself in potential danger 

Time. For the (assuming self-aware, three-laws compliant robots) robots, time takes the form of energy supply - if they run out of energy, they run out of time. For the humans, time takes the form of robots performing services for them, even earning money for them. Leaving them free to do whatever they want. The exchange rate (between robot time/human time) would be something to work out though. 

First, consider the psychology of the dictator - that personality trusts no one, has to be first in everything, is extremely egotistical, paranoid and intolerant - especially of disloyalty. So impressing him would mean you're a totally loyal sycophant, but you'd have to be a useful one. Would a dictator encourage cooperation? Not really, that personality is too paranoid. Autocratic tyrant is a synonym for dictator so same applies. A democratically elected leader, however would be another story. Since a hierarchical culture style is set from the top down, the leader would himself have to demonstrate the merits of cooperation, and then develop a reward system for those minions following his example.
