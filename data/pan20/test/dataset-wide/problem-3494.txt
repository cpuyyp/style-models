Simply no. A perfect monopoly's profit maximizing output will always be smaller than the competitive market as a whole would have provided. And the price would be higher. The marginal revenue curve of the monopoly is not the demand curve while in case of competitive market the marginal revenue curve is the demand curve itself. Summing up the optimum individual supplies horizontally we get the market supply. Also, all the firms in a competitive market are in a 'prisoner's dilemma'. There exists a price rigidity. Even if a firm's cost curves shift up (increase) it cannot increase the price readily as it will face a devastatingly elastic demand curve as soon as it does so and it will be thrown out of market. In case all of them collude to restrict output and increase price, there will be an unsatisfied demand in the market which will lure someone or the other to defect and satisfy that demand at a lower price and earn huge profits and the collusion will fail (there are real life examples of such incidents such as OPEC which enjoyed exorbitant oil prices-the oil shock in 1970s but its power now is highly reduced). So in the long run all firms in a competitive market are bound to earn zero economic profit and hence they cannot behave as a monopoly together. But there is a catch here. If the monopoly has access to some crucial technology which it could possess only because of economies of scale then the monopoly can actually provide a lower cost than the perfect competition. This is one of the argued benefits of a monopoly. For example it is said that INTEL enjoyed monopoly and hence supranormal profits in the initial years because of which it could invest heavily in research and development which it could not have been able to do otherwise. This actually helped the industry to grow and eventually cheaper technology was made available. However these arguments are open to debate. 

General price level is defined by the price that you pay for a basket of goods. This basket of goods is decided on the basis of general consumption patterns in the economy and includes a number of sectors (with a number of items) like food, transport, medical care, etc. Such baskets can be defined differently to arrive at different measures of general price levels such as the one faced by end consumers or wholesale buyers. In a nutshell, it gives an idea of how the prices in the economy are moving. So, price of a good A might increase while price of good B might decrease but it may so happen that the general price level may increase or decrease depending upon the defined basket and the weights assigned to the items in basket. 

You are at a decision point and you don't know what strategy the other player has taken. But you still know that which game you are in, you still know the other players' strategy sets etc. Under incomplete information you might not even know what game you are into. For example: Two firms are taking up R&D projects sequentially. One is the first mover. It decides whether to take up R&D or not. Now the second firm has to decide but does not know what first firm has decided. This is imperfect information. Now imagine ypu are playing a card game and need to throw a card but you don't know whether you are playing poker or sweep. This is incomplete information. 

Yes, I think you can do that but that is going to make the tree very ugly. Say there are 4 players. P1 is government and P2, P3 and P4 are the population. Now first let P1 make a decision. Then let P2 make a decision under uncertainty using an equivalence class to make it simultaneous and then P3 and P4 in the same fashion. This will be an explicit way of doing so if you want to model a simultaneous move game. You can also assume government to be P1 and the population as P2 which contains the three individuals. With this you will have to make all combinations of the state of P2 according to their action sets. For example, one state could be when one out of the three individuals accepts the tax law and the other two reject it. 

Theoretically basic income might have a tendency to increase inflation. But that largely depends on how much is the basic income provided. Usually, the idea of basic income itself means that it is 'basic' and is just sufficient for a subsistence. With such an income level, the problem of inflation does not crop up really. However, basic income might have other serious problems with crowding out due to large government spending and the disincentive to work and hence loss of productivity. Even if we suppose, there is a large basic money disbursement which can cause inflation, then I think it should not be unconditional. Usually, such plans are in the form of guaranteed employment programs, buying of ration from designated stores and many more measures. However, I still feel these measures are not for tackling inflation rather the disincentive to work. 

Yes, the two figures are different because that is how the economy works in a circular flow. To calculate the size of economy (GDP), we will find the total expenditure, total income or total production. In theory, all three calculations should converge at the same figure. However, in economies they may give different figures. It is a fault of whole concept of GDP that it does not take into account any transaction for which there is not a market price available. So, no matter how much gardening you do at your home, you are not adding up anything in the economy. So, whatever mutual understanding you have with you neighbor and whatever transactions you make, it won't be considered. In the second part of your example, you are spending 10 dollars and your employer is spending 50 dollars so that add up to 60 dollars. This happens because of circular flow, your income is somebody else's expenditure. Production for which there is no price will not be counted.
