Imagine the following situation: A group of friends found a remote spot in a state or national forest that they really like. They keep returning to the place quite often, lately there are at least some members of the group staying overnight at the spot at least once or twice a month. They established a fire ring, surrounded by rocks, and someone dragged few logs around the fire to sit on. They have a rope strung in the trees to hand their food from. Now some of them have an idea that it would be nice to build few camp benches instead of the logs, and perhaps some primitive wooden shelter. It is clear that there is some sort of limit, they clearly cannot go and build a large log cabin there. There must be some sort of limit between few logs around a circle of rocks for fireplace and a cabin. I am wondering what would still be considered OK, and where one would cross the limit. 

I made myself a simple wood burning stove from a small tomato can, and I am pretty happy with it, but now I am wondering if I would get significantly increased performance by making a more complicated double wall "bushbuddy" style stove. Does anybody have any experience with DIY double wall wood burning stoves? Is there enough increase in performance to justify the more complicated design? 

I have used hexamine fuel in sub-freezing temperatures before, and my experience is that it works reasonably well if you keep your stove protected from the wind. In cold weather it will take several cubes to get your water boiling. You really need to keep the stove protected from wind, though, even in warm weather, the flame gets blown off pretty easily. 

There are several other variations, marking a spring or well, historic ruin, vista point etc. Intersections of trails usually have pointers telling you what direction to take to get to various locations, as well as their distances in kilometers. The other component of the trail system is a collection of maps, that have the color coded trails mark in them. They are usually quite detailed and easy to use. You can buy them in any bookstore, newspaper stand, and in many museum and souvenir shops. The online map server at mapy.cz has a setting that shows the trails as well. The second thing is of interest to backpackers. While it is illegal to "wild camp" in Czech Republic, in most areas it is a fairly common practice. If one is smart about it, one can usually avoid detection, and even when discovered, if you clearly behave well, do not damage the environment, do not litter etc, and behave politely, forest or park rangers often let you go. There is some dispute about it, but it seems that it is actually legal to sleep in the woods as long as you do not make a fire and do not build any kind of shelter. There are number of exceptions, mainly in national parks and nature preserves, but in general, you can sleep in woods if you do it in a smart way. 

From my experience - no way. If the temperature outside is below the comfort range of your sleeping bag, you'll have to put some extra things on you, otherwise you risk hypothermia (in best case - sleepless night). The best things are the fleece ones. However, when it goes to trousers and jackets (normal or rain-proof, without warming), it's usually a better idea to put them under your sleeping bag or foam-pad, to increase isolation from ground (the most head you loose through ground). So actually it may be a source of that hypothesis - better to sleep without trousers, and sleep on them instead. However, many people claim that it's warmer to sleep naked. Well, the ones I know have very warm (and expensive) sleeping bags, so the temperatures were above their comfort rage. I have an impression that such rumors are produced by sleeping bag producers, which want people to buy warmer sleeping bags for cold weather, instead of trying to keep them warm in their (cheaper) summer-time sleeping bags with extra layers of clothing. Note that sleeping bags are relatively new. As a soldier in 1st World War, you had only a blanket to keep you warm and you had to sleep in everything you have on you during winter. 

I was geocaching a bit and I've found in many caches the warning not to cache in the night during the winter because of hunting season. My question is, have such limitations a legal basis, and if so, how restrictive they are (and how can I check what where exactly is limited)? Now the day is long, but I would like to continue long walking in other seasons, which would mean walking in the dark. Are there any restrictions that apply to: 

This is an extremely long trail. Very good walkers are able to do 30-50 km (depending on weather and terrain) each day for a very long time. But for seasoned (though physically very fit) walker a realistic estimate is on avg. 25 km/day. So for 7000 km you would need 280 days. According to the article on outdoorseiten.de the trail part in Romania is not done yet, it means, you would have to plan it yourself, according to general route description. You will need precise maps of this terrain. The mountain terrains are one of the most wild in Europe, so you'd need tents as well, and you should expect to be able to buy food only in bigger cities, so you'd have to take a plenty with you. In the Carpatian part of Poland/Slovakia/Czech you could sleep in mountain huts. The prices shouldn't be more than 10 Euro/night. However, not everywhere you'll have electricity in rooms, so you can rely on maps in GPS receiver, but you should have a few of them (since you plan a group trip, it should not be a problem), and prepare mobile chargers as well. In Western European part, the prices would be higher, but you should expect not to have problems with electricity and food, so you would not need to take so much with you. --edit-- My acquaintance has just made a way from Warsaw to Santiago de Compostella. Here is the original article with statistics, quick translation follows: 

There is another problem with making a fire in a natural cave: the smoke propagating through the cave can severely affect various cave-dwelling species, particularly bats. That is especially bad during winter, when smoke and warm air from the fire can wake up the bats and drive them out of the cave, causing them to freeze or starve to death. 

Krakow is amazingly beautiful and interesting town, so you may end up spending all your time in the town itself, but there are some great opportunities for hiking nearby. There are several websites about Krakow that you can look at. This one lists some ideas for day trips. The Ojcow national park is just north of Krakow, apparently it is possible to get there by bus. If you are willing to travel a bit further, about 70km south of Krakow are the Beskidy mountains, with Gorczanski and Babigorski national parks. All of those are definitely worth seeing, and offer plenty of hiking opportunities. It takes about hour and 30 minutes to get from Krakow Main station to Sucha Beskidzka, which is sort of a gateway into that part of Beskidy mountains. There is a very nice brochure(pdf) describing some hiking opportunities in the region. 

Finally, my third suggestion is the Sázava river valley. Take a train from the Bráník train station to Pikovice, take a red trail, cross the river and follow it upstream (again, depending on how much time you have, you may want to start closer to Prague, or even in Prague. You can catch the same red trail in Zbraslav or Vrané. In fact, it is just a different part of the same red trail that leads through Karlštejn.) The trail will closely follow the Sázava river, with a nice view of its rapids. You can follow it all the way to Kamený Přívoz, where it will cross the river again. There you will have several options. You can take a train back to Prague, follow a series of green, blue, red and yellow trails back to Pikovice or even to Prague, or continue on the red trail to Prosečnice. From there you can take the yellow trail through Vlčí Rokle (the Wolf Ravine), which is quite interesting and nice. After that you will have a whole scale of possibilities, there are number of trails that you can take, most of them leading you eventually to a train or bus station. Hopefully this will be at least somewhat helpful. Enjoy your visit. Perhaps one more advice: Czechs are generally rather fond of hiking, and many of them know their hiking areas quite well. If you are going there for a conference, for business, of to visit friends, you may want to ask your hosts where to hike. They will probably be able to give you a better, more current advice, and perhaps they will even go with you. 

Availability factor - cotton socks you can buy practically everywhere. When it comes to price, the wool socks you can buy relatively cheap in the military surplus, but it usually means buying in internet. Wool socks are good for winter, but for me they are not-an-option in summer because my feet sweat in them like mad. Wool socks are also heavier and taking much more place than thin cotton socks. For summer, an alternative to thin cotton socks are the syntetic ones (I haven't seen thin wool socks). Then the price comes into play. Maybe there are simple, cheap syntetic ones, but I know only those 'active' ones from sport shops - they are very expensive compared to cotton ones - about 5 times more. So in summer, I prefer to take more cheap, light cotton socks and change them more often. 

Generally the far from the civilization you go, the safer your things are. Thiefs are operating there where people live or where there are a lot of people. Distant rocks, caves etc. are not their target. I have not heard of something being stolen from someone's luggage in mountains, for example. If some point is at least a few km far from the place where you can go with car, you can trust people there. However, you may consider masking your luggage with some wood or leaves, or hide at least the most valuable things under a rock, in not so obvious place. I have experience from geocaching, that even if you know exactly (with ~10m precision) that something is there, it is often very difficult to find it, especially when it's something small. You should only be sure you'll remember where you have hidden it! 

It's a geocacher's nightmare, when you do a nice urbex cache, and then, when leaving, find the entrance blocked by angry homeless, that seem to live there and are not happy from unexpected visitor (which isn't surprising). How to deal such situations, to avoid the confrontation, which could end poorly, or loosing your wallet, which also isn't a dream situation? Are there any tricks to lighten the atmosphere, for example offering cigarettes? 

The principle of washing in winter is, generally speaking, the same as in summer. You find some stream (you usually camp near the stream) and wash there. The water in streams is fluid even by slightly minus temperatures, only the washing is more extreme because of cold. If the water in the stream is frozen, you can melt in in the canteen and you can wash yourself. It's really a bad idea to wash yourself on the morning. Firstly, because there's never much time, second it's good idea to wash before going into your sleeping bag. First you keep it cleaner, second, according to many people, the body is able to produce more heat at night if it's clean. 

I spent some time in a wigwam today, and due to the wind conditions, it was very difficult to keep the smoke out. Are there some tricks one can use in a situation like that to make the wigwam more habitable, or to deal with the smoke in some way? 

The country is crisscrossed by an extensive system of inteconnected hiking trails, that allows you to get on foot from pretty much any place to any other place. The system is maintained by the Klub Českých Turistů (Czech Tourist Club), and consists of two components: trail markings and corresponding maps. Each trail is assigned one of four colors: red, yellow, green or blue. It used to be that red color was reserved for long distance trails, often following a long mountain range or a similar such feature, yellow trails were shorter, branching from the red ones, and green and blue were reserved for local or connecting trails, but as far as I can tell, that is no longer strictly followed. The trails are marked in terain by trail marks that look like a horizontal color stripe (red, yellow, green or blue) between two horizontal white stripes, like this: 

You will then follow the red trail through Karlík valley and Mořinka all the way to Karlštejn. The castle in Karlštejn is a very popular tourist attraction, and can be pretty crowded. Most visitors take a train or bus to the village, and climb the souvenir shop encrusted road up to the castle. The red trail will bring you to the castle from different side. You will still have to pass through some of the madness, but you will avoid the worst. You can visit the castle if you want. Then continue on the red trail past the castle. Keep following the red trail till you get to an intersection of several trails called "Propadlé Vody". From there you have number of options, but my favorite always was to take the yellow trail to the north, marked on the map as "Svatojánský okruh" (St. John circle). It will take you past the Arnika cave, through some interesting long abandoned limestone quarries all the way to a vist point on the top of the cliff overlooking the St. John valley and the monastery. Bacrtacking a bit and following the trail further will take you down to the valley. From there, you have several options. You can take the blue trail north and catch a train or bus in Vráž. You can stay on the red trail and end up in the city of Beroun, with several options for transportation back tp Prague. Or you can take the yellow trail south to Srbsko, where you can take a train back to Prague. If you want to hike more, you have a number of options, including those:
