While Amish communities are passive by nature there have been many schisms, the body of believers is divided and in many cases subdivided by religious doctrine. This religious division may lend it self well to having a single yet still divided empire. 

The cool thing about this sort of equipment is that it is all designed to be as light, strong, and durable as possible. If you wouldn't want it strapped to your back while scaling a cliff, its too heavy. Mountaineering gear gives our friend Ned some additional tactical options. In most urban and wilderness areas he could climb to avoid zombies. Any nearby tree or structure becomes a safe haven. Rope and simple hardware opens up a whole litany of trapping options. When push comes to shove the ice axe can be used as a light weight club, axe, and/or stabbing implement. Ned could climb a tree let out enough line to comfortably hang out in his harness above the zombies reach and crack heads until the horde thinned out. 

Wouldn't the robot have most of the necessary equipment? To move around a humanoid bot would need pretty soffisticated cameras, motion sensors, possibly even sonar to navigate and interact with the world. The screen could be as simple as your typical "smart" TV, adding a webcam may be helpful, but I'm not sure if it would be required. 

As their prey gets bigger and starts to form herds and fight back, the dragons further develop their fire-breathing ability, sticky bile gets ignited to form an effective napalm. At first the fire adaptation is probably used to redirect and break up herds. At this stage the going adaptations for avoiding dragon attacks would be: 

Ease of manufacture was my first thought, but I'm not entirely sure if that really holds for modern machining... My second thought was ricochet. A ballbearing would likely have a more predictable and possibly more powerful ricochet as it wouldn't tumble after the initial impact. Imagine blasting hard rubber shot at an angle down a concrete hallway. 

Ignoring ancestral guidance, I would focus on war games. Many modern militaries have regular war games where units compete against each other or their allies. These can take many forms, from submarine hide and seek, to field exercises with paintball guns. There's even some evidence that nuclear command units participate in war games and drills. It looks like their willingness to launch is put the test every so often. Given the moral and ethical implications of using nuclear weapons, governments want to be sure that their people will really "push the button" when the time comes. 

On the other hand "Ancestral knowledge" may change things a bit. If the majority of soldiers can be imprinted with the memories of long dead ancestors they may more or less inherit veteran status. This would probably help with developing a willingness to fight, bravery in the face of danger, and obedience. That said training and war games would still be necessary simply because the weapons and tactics will have changed significantly since the last war. 

Here's a little inspiration, if you have doubts about throwing heavy objects long distances Also... It's a trebuchet... so you have the option of throwing all sorts of fun things at approaching zombies. Think of it this way, instead of 2 birds with one stone, you get 10 zombies with one throw, plus however many zombies you manage to hit. 

Build your trebuchet Raise your counterweight Lasso a few zombies in the moat Lob them out Rinse and repeat 

This approach adds a little ambiguity as to whether this god is good or evil, which may leave you more wiggle room for twists in the plot. To bad people he/she/it is evil and spiteful. To everyone else he/she/it is a good god of justice. Effectively this god steps in to make bad things happen to bad people for the delight of onlookers. You can tip the scales in the evil direction if needed, by making this god a little overzealous or proactive. Just have this god step in and dole out harsh, yet humorous punishments for the slightest of infractions. 

In any post apocalyptic scenario things that are more readily understood or maintained would be salvaged and things that were too complex, or not immediately useful fall apart. Key point: In any post apocalyptic scenario the tech that gets saved is the tech that is most readily and immediately useful. Think of it as survival priorities. In an eat or be eaten world, what is most likely to help you not get eaten? How does this apply to the question at hand? Some tech will be more valued than other tech by survivors. For the survivors who make their home, refuge, and living on the water; sail boats and sailing related tech will be really valuable and worth maintaining. Finding fuel, oil, and parts for a motor will require a lot more effort. Clean running water is more difficult to maintain, but its also infinitely valuable to any surviving population. If your compound, village, or what have you, is the only one around with clean drinking water and flushing toilets you're sitting on a goldmine. This sort of logic could explain the how and why of a staggered tech level. Gunpowder is really easy and really useful, wireless communication is harder and somewhat less useful (there's fewer people to call after all). On the other hand cloning and holograms would be harder to justify... You may be able to justify cloning with the type of apocalypse, perhaps if there was a plague that killed off the majority of the population and left the survivors sterile, it would create a drive to develop and maintain this science in order to save the species. Holograms would likely be even hard to justify though. Holograms just aren't terribly useful for survival. Perhaps if there was a Hologram Cult, where some David Koresh like leader was using holograms to draw in believers it could be pulled off, but that requires a rather large suspension of disbelief. 

While hopping on one moving train seems reasonable for a healthy young adult, hopping two hundred seems a little excessive and dangerous... Also I would imagine that most people going on a long distance trip will be bringing luggage. I'm sure I could jog up and on to a slow moving train unhindered, but a little less sure about doing so with a suitcase in each hand. And I wouldn't even consider it for a family holiday with the crumb snatchers. Beyond that you need to consider the fuel/energy costs involved in keeping 200 trains in constant motion, not to mention that each train completely encircles the planet. That's an awfully huge investment just for moving passengers. You couldn't​ realistically move freight from one train to the next. On top of the fuel costs you would have some pretty huge maintenance issues... The trains would cover the entire track, so making repairs to any one section of track means shutting the entire system down and removing several train cars before repairs could even begin. Likewise repairing and maintaining​ the individual trains would mean shutting down at least most of the system. Then there's the worst case scenario... Should any one of the trains derail you're looking at a really, really, really ugly domino effect. Your trains would have to travel really close to one another to allow passengers to hop between them... Imagine someone drops their luggage on the track making the hop. A hard metal briefcase slips under the wheel... The car tips just enough to bump against the next faster train, which in turn bumps the next, and so on... This tiny ripple could and likely would build into a tsunami of grinding twisting metal. See: $URL$ 

I'm not sure if this is what you're after, but I weathered Irma in Florida... During the storm I was forced to go outside to smoke so I had an opportunity to watch the ducks and squirrels. They seemed to weather the storm just fine, by just doing their usual things. When the wind got really high I noticed a squirrel gripping the tree on the leeward side, using the trunk of the tree as a wind break. The ducks just seemed to huddle together on the ground and faced into the wind so that their feathers didn't ruffle. The next morning I went out to find that even the baby ducklings had survived. I think the animal kingdom tends to do better than humans in these situations, because they're not dependant on infrastructure to survive. When it rains they get wet, when it's windy they get blown around a bit, but other than that they're good with it. 

Also... A lot of the answers here also seem to suggest that women are less physically capable as a given. I reject that assumption. While men tend to have more upper body strength, women tend to have greater lower body strength. There isn't really that much difference in muscle mass without physical training, it's just placed differently. 

Allowing for the premise I still have my doubts about field amputation without a trained surgeon. The most relivant statistics I could find come from the American Civil war, where field amputation was a common treatment for wounds to the extremities. Primary amputation mortality rate: 28%. Secondary amputation mortality rate: 52% Primary being death in surgery and Secondary being death from subsequent infection. It's also worth noting that those figures get much worse the closer you get to the body. Upper leg amputation mortality was 83% There are a few differences worth noting... Civil war surgeons weren't familiar with the concept of sterile surgery, so I suppose your people get a very small bonus there. Also contrary to popular depiction most Civil War amputees did have the benefit of anesthesia, which would be a huge deficit for your​ people. Also keep in mind that while Civil War surgery was crude the surgeons got a lot of practice, at least they had done it before... I very seriously doubt that someone who had never even witnessed an amputation could successfully pull it off. So... In short your chances of surviving a post apocalyptic amputation are slim. I would put the mortality figure somewhere around 75-85% for a lower limb. Probably 90-95% closer to the body. Keep in mind that there is a world of difference between slapping on a tourniquet, hacking off a limb, and getting the person to a hospital vs. a field amputation and hoping for the best... It seems I may not have expounded on the point well enough... The difference is dealing with the nitty gritty. In a field amputation you anesthetize the poor guy, tie off the limb with a tourniquet, cut the skin being sure to leave a flap, slice through the surrounding muscle and tissue as quickly and cleanly as possible, tie off the spurting arteries with a piece of thread, scrape the bone smooth to remove sharp edges, suture the stump using the remaining flap of skin being sure to leave a port for the wound to "seep", and finally wrap the remaining limb in a cast of sorts, and further medicate with powerful painkillers (heroin) for several days while the poor guy writhes in agony. Do you really think a layman can do that... Before the guy bleeds out... With a struggling, screaming patient...Without anesthesia... ? Source: $URL$ 

It was more or less an early artificial pet, but notice also that it appears almost deliberately artificial looking, bearing little to no resemblance to any actual person or animal, but some people still found them creepy[citation needed]. Now compare the Furby with the Genpet1: 

At the risk of sounding culturally insensitive, you may want to consider the way someone learning a new language speaks. They often have little conjugation, as in only using the present tense. Limited vocabulary, only words they've needed to get by thus far. Few descriptive words. Think size, basic colors​, hot/cold. For instance, I know I can ask for a bathroom and a dark beer in Spanish, but I'm far from fluent. Just enough to communicate basic needs. The exception to this line of thought would be a very well developed sense of their surrounding world. Expect to hear very specific names for plants and animals that they see around them. Rather than general words like "tree" they would likely have names for every variety of tree, particularly ones that produced food. 

I doubt there's anything you could do to make them "happy", even mildly oppressed people are generally going to be upset about it. But there are some things you can do to make them less likely to revolt... Bread and circuses​ are the classic route​ and you already have circuses. People who are well fed and entertained are probably going to be a little more manageable. Another approach is to further stratify your slaves into classes, so there's at least the hope of upward mobility. Note that they don't actually need to be able to significantly change their position, they just need hope, an illusion of upward mobility. "If you work extra special hard, one day you could be the head slave. Here have a cookie. Who's a good human? You are!"
