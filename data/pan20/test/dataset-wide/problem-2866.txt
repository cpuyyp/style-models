If the etymology of emotions is considered, (in Greek συγκίνηση, συν = together, common and κίνησης = movement, motion) then this could bring out that emotions are important parts of life. These are types of inner impulses that put us in movement. Psychology considers very highly emotions and their styles, their management procedures and their externalization. The origin, differences, meaning, usefulness, over-accumulation of repressed emotions and more, are complicated subjects and a whole series of theories has been developed for their analysis. Emotions are not only created inside a particular individual but may represent projections of the collective desires and needs, back in the individual which the individual perceives as personal feelings, motivations and impulses. As the externalization of emotions often produces difficulties in the functioning of social life control mechanisms are created or proposed, but often these control mechanisms form a reservoir of repressed impulses which are returning back with even greater force and urgency to their satisfaction. Generally life as it is one of the more complex phenomena of the world seems unlikely that its meaning could be compressed into a single purpose. 

It is not exactly like that. Dualism talks about two different fundamental substances i.e. mind and matter. There is a gap between these two substances. How do they react one on the other? Monism in the varieties of idealism or materialism solve this problem by assuming one fundamental substance. Idealism presupposes everything is an idea, and materialism everything is matter. It's a discussion that goes back to the ancient philosophy. Plato's treatment of the case give rise to the statement "only the same can acknowledge the same". The different "families" you mention are different qualities of the basic substance. $URL$ 

Benjamin's essay praises surrealism as the only bourgeoisie ideology that follows the "present commands" of the Communist Manifesto (the article is written in 1929), and tries to "awake" the mind by becoming an alarm clock (check surrealism's use of scandal and similar means to achieve awareness of the importance of politicization), that alarms 60 times per minute (all the time). Benjamin obviously was concerned about the world situation and the upcoming second world war. I think Benjamin in this essay does not say anywhere that a communist revolution is meaningless. He just critics surrealism under the ideas of Marxism. 

I will add here the most common usages of the term κατηγορώ. An accuser in a court is a κατήγορος. A sentence is in general a κατηγόρημα applied via the verb to the subject. "Socrates is sleeping" Socrates the subject is called that he is sleeping, his being is categorized "accused- called" with the accidental of sleep. "Socrates is beautiful" Beautiful is called in Greek grammar κατηγορούμενο. (an adjective called on the subject) The "κατηγορίες", genres, species, αυτό το φυτό ανήκει στην κατηγορία των οπωροφόρων, this plant belongs to the taxonomy (category) of orchards. Ταξινομία means to puts something in its τάξη, i.e. order. Category means to have called something as different and distinguishable from others. To be able to call something on its own, to accuse it, means to differentiate it. κατά + αγορεύω = "for this" "I talk in public" , plead a. η απόδοση μομφής σε κάποιον, καταγγελία = complaint, denunciation b. η ομάδα στην οποία ανήκει ένα είδος, το σύνολο ομοίων πραγμάτων ή ιδεών ομάδα, τάξη, σύνολο/ group, taxis- order, aggregation, summation 

It depends on the situation. For an example having a small car, can be better than having no car (if you have a need for it), but eating once in a week will lead to the death of the person similarly to having nothing to eat. So some times something is better than nothing, but other times something is equal to nothing. There are also situations where nothing is better than something. 

Self contradictory is something that contradicts its own self. A set of all sets is self contradictory because a set cannot contain its own self normally, so it cannot contain "all sets". Its a self reference paradox. $URL$ $URL$ $URL$ $URL$ EDIT: To locate the self reference element check this example: Suppose that every public library has to compile a catalogue of all its books. Since the catalogue is itself one of the library's books, a librarian should include it in the catalogue for completeness. But what would happen if there were a restriction that when the book is a catalogue it should include a list of its contents? This will lead to an infinite repetition of the catalogue name with its contents. 

And in this article about the "Hellenistic" period (~300 BC) there are some info about Greek interactions in far east $URL$ $URL$ 

I will add here an anarcho-communist perspective in broad lines. Marx supported his critique of bourgeois democracy (The critique of the Hegelian philosophy of Right) in Hegel's text "Philosophy of Right" a purely bourgeois analysis of economic-political relations among economical classes in which bourgeois democracy is analyzed as: A bourgeoisie regime, a dictatorship of the bourgeoisie where the state is controlled and used to support the interest of the leading bourgeois class, exploit the inferior economic strata and secure with the usage of violence its status. Bourgeois democracy is a liberal regime only for the capital and its owners (ownership of means of production). The inferior economic strata experience it as a forced totalitarian social-political relationship (Marx's interpretation, mine wording). In this context, Marx was led to the idea of the "dictatorship of the proletariat", an economic order established from the industrial proletariat (having for property only their labor force) as a stage in the transition to a society of economic equality and the consequent dissolution of any kind of oppressive state. (based on the example of the French commune of 1871). Economical historicism or determinism, the idea that economic relations act above and beyond individual people wills and economical classes, seems to many as a non-scientific idea. Actually it is just a common sense observation based on facts in the history of society organization. It took the form of a strict law only for ideological purposes. The case of this law is based on the observation of the rise of power of the bourgeoisie when the development of society allowed it and imposed it during the modern years (French revolution) and in confrontation with the ancient regime, the aristocracy and feudalism (which as a form of society organization has fulfilled its "historical role" and then only delayed the forces of progress and societies growth). What Marx could not and wasn't supposed to see, is how the bourgeois state would react under the emergence of the political consiousness of the proletariat, and how it would join (the bourgeois state) a collaboration with some parts of the petite-bourgeois (fascism-militarism), and in these circumstances (white Terror, two world wars), the proletariat would lose all the capacity to develop the new political formation and would be ignored by the dominance of individual alliances within the bourgeoisie class. This alliance of the upper bourgeoisie with extreme parts of the petite bourgeoisie (imperialism, militarism) led to the destruction of large parts of the labor and resources of society and the regression in terms of the possibilities for the transition to a more developed form of social organization. Consequently regimes under the banner of communism degenerated into bourgeois bureaucracies antagonistic but in essence supplementary to traditional bourgeois -democracies. Carl Popper acted as a supporter of bourgeois relations, he tried to link the Marxian theory of communism and economical historicism to totalitarian/militaristic regimes, ignoring the particular differences that are clear to every impartial observer. This is evidenced by the positive reception of communist, libertarian ideas by progressives and democrats around the world. $URL$ $URL$ $URL$ $URL$ $URL$ $URL$ $URL$ 

so because the drama is developed from the ceremonies in honor of Dionysus it can be said that it originates from "rituals" but during its development it has transformed to a expression/artistic medium. The significance of the beliefs regarding Dionysus is quite complicated, and has influenced both demystification but also mystical-religious thinking (see Orphism for an example). $URL$ $URL$ $URL$ $URL$ $URL$ 

It does not always. If Mike is a dog owner then he can be a good one or a bad one or a mediocre, or sometimes good and sometimes bad, or depending of what aspect of "dog ownership" is investigated any other type. But there are specific types of "treatments" that will make Mike a "good owner" and if he deviates from these a bad one. So i think it is not always a fundamental misconception of laymen thought. If statement A is true then a true negation of it leads to the opposite statement to become true. $URL$ 

An example I can think of is the different approaches to the ethnological studies of the late 19th century by Sigmund Freud (in Totem and taboo) and Elia Kaneti in (Mass and authority). The same writers also derive different ideas about the case of the "judge Schreber". 

The classic paradox of the liar (I am lying) directly indicates a contradiction, because while I declare that I am lying in practice I' m telling the truth (that I am lying), which means that I tell the truth and I lie at the same time. This is a classic paradox of self-reference. The value of the paradox lies exactly in this unsolvability because it reveals in front of us the contradiction as a real condition. The looped liar paradox is not obviously self referential, but in practice it is a developed form of the liar's paradox and the two subjects of the two statements practically are consolidated (since the one points to the other in succession) and so through reason is produced a single subject which displays the same contradictory relation as it is predicated with two opposite predicaments at the same time. 

Self-observation is very important in the development of consciousness. Of course not mere self observation but self-observation inside a society with all the necessary parameters like language, freedom, will etc. Here I distinguish two types of "feedback". The linear-in-time feedback as for example in computer systems or any other known feedback scheme and the idea of actual feedback. The actual feedback suggests joining a future point to a past point. In practice, because of the linear nature of time it is an impossible situation, a fantastic idea which leads to a paradox and is incomprehensible. On the other let's think about what happens at the time of self-observation. The self takes the place of the other, and reviews himself from the position of the other. We have the identity and the segregation of self and other. Self observation does not end with simple acts of self-observation, but we can say that when we are being looked by others in practice we are putting to look at ourselves. Consciousness not only needs a subject and a "mirror", but requires society -the other- and the subject will see himself within the social relations. History is a form of collective self observation, the ability to observe and reflex our past beings back to our new selves. (this can lead to the preposterous fallacy if we unify the past self with the present self). The self (the catholic self and the individual self) is an endless path of alienation (with the ontological meaning) and re-identification. When we look at ourselves we see the outer appearance, which suggests a lot but we are all a jumble of appearance and content. That is why the eyes which can be seen as a part of the interior -a part of the brain- that is simultaneously exterior, are very sensitive (full of meaning) to the act of self-observation and observation of others. But not only our eyes but rather the eyes of others and in our turn we become these outer eyes who look at others selves and criticize. And this critique consists the foundation of consciousness. {...}
