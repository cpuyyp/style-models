We are running Exchange 2003 Standard in-house. The Director of Operations has just let two staff members go, and would like e-mail sent to their addresses sent to him. Here is what I have done so far: 

This is a pure-Microsoft shop; so unfortunately the standard Linux tools are not available to us. What I have tried: 

A3: If you trust your co-workers, there is no reason why you couldn't share a single ssh/sftp account. I do suggest that you disable FTP completely, if you can or at the very least disable FTP for that user. Since your site has already been compromised, also make sure all your passwords are changed. All of them: mysql, apache, root, and any other users or accounts. 

A2: This depends on what you want. If there are only two or three of you working together - then there really isn't much reason why sharing an account would be a problem. On a side note, depending on who you are working with and your trust level with these folks, you really want the ssh/sftp account that you are all sharing to NOT be a root/administrative user. 

First, I'm making some assumptions, so please excuse me if I missed the point of your question. I'm assuming that you are providing some web hosting services for some of your clients, and now they are asking for control over the web host, as opposed to you doing all the work for them. Two words: virtual machine. Don't give them access to your host web server. Let them have full control of a VM instance - if they muck it up, your more valuable host is not harmed or tampered with - only their sites & services. Then you can give them administrative control over the instance and not have to worry about it (except for backups of their initial instance - but that depends on your contract with your clients). They'll also feel more special when you give them an administrator account. :-) I highly recommend this path if it is at all possible for you. If that's not an option and you're OK with sharing your host system with your clients, I would then suggest partitioning one of your disk arrays such that your client has their own volume to host their sites and data from. You could create a base directory for them within your own , but then you have to muck around with NTFS permissions and inheritance, which, depending upon the complexity of your file system, could get ugly. If it's an option, it's much simpler to create a new volume/partition - with their own volume to use, security will be much, much simpler as you could give them full control over the volume, and you can assign disk space limitations as well so they can't fill up your disks and bring your system to a halt. I think you're on the right track with the separate application pools and separate sites. You may want to look at this article on the delegation of rights to manage sites and applications (iis7). It'll get more complicated if they start using databases - however, if all they want to do is host some static content, the above should keep them from running amok. 

Your own redirects were most likely recursively redirecting to the index.php. You need to block the rule for that script, so it isn't run on that page request, e.g.: 

I supply a yum repository with PHP 5.3 in, which fits in with existing PHP setups when upgrading. I can't guarantee that Plesk will be happy with it though unless they've updated it to support PHP 5.3 $URL$ There is also the Zend Server Community Edition, which you may find more suitable, however it doesn't provide packages under the same naming conventions, so you would have to switch between packages. $URL$ 

Since you've already upgraded PHP however, it may be easiest to either compile eAccelerator yourself (its not available via pecl): $URL$ or switch to a repository that supplies eAccelerator rpm for the PHP version installed. I provide eaccelerator for PHP 5.3, along with PHP 5.3 itself if you need it. I don't supply eaccelerator for PHP 5.2 though. $URL$ then 

mod_auth_mysql's crypt algorithm uses a different format of hash to Bugzilla's e.g. a crypt SHA-256 password would look like this: 

Note the 's' in the group permissions. This makes the writer users use git-writers group as their default group. This will only work properly if the writers are all umask 0002. 

So, given all of the above, is Microsoft NLB the only answer? Or are there better tools available for our situation? Edit 4/21/11 Thanks for the quick feedback. Just to clarify a few points: 

Our Exchange server is running on the . We're dealing with the mail store size issue, where if the mail store goes over the limit, it gets dismounted. While we are working with the powers-that-be on a policy that will prevent this happening in the future, I would like to see if it is possible to re-mount the mail store via the Windows CLI. I'm already monitoring the Event Logs and alerting on mail store warnings and dismounts - I'm just tired of getting up at 5am to manually re-mount the store while the political wars ensue. My alerting tools have the ability to execute a batch script when an alert is generated. I would greatly prefer a native CLI option. I'm not too keen on running some random vbscript found on the Internet and I don't really care to spend my time debugging someone else's code. PowerShell might be an option, if it can be triggered from the CLI. 

You may want to ditch DHCP on the wireless router and use the Windows DHCP Server. It's a bit more robust than your average wireless router (though, I don't know what you have so that may or may not be true). Either way, there are two things you may be missing that is preventing users on the domain from accessing the internet: a default gateway, and dns servers. In your DHCP server, make sure you are passing out a default gateway with the address of your wireless router, and also the address of whatever is serving DNS for you. If it's your domain controller, then hand out that address. If it's your wireless router, then hand that address instead. You can check what these values are on your desktops by doing an ipconfig /all command from the command line. If you are missing one or either, or they are pointed to the wrong place, the "internet" won't work as expected. Look for Default Gateway and DNS Servers ip addresses. It should look something like this (this is a Windows 7 snapshot on my LAN): 

It will be the first VirtualHost that matches which will be loaded, and since the files are loaded in alphabetical order, you can change the ordering by changing the filenames. What I do is put a number prefix for each filename so I can set the priority in order to do something like what you mention. e.g.: 

If you are able to get more than one IP address added to the virtualhost, then you can use two SSL virtualhosts, with each using one of two SSL certificates. The virtualhosts would each need to identify which IP address they should be using e.g. in Apache Httpd: 

You can resolve it by switching the mysql-libs package to mysql55w-libs. This needs to be done in one transaction to avoid it uninstalling the other dependencies: 

Webtatic's php56w on CentOS 5 and 6 is only compiled to support the base httpd 2.2 packages. This is because mod_php is compiled against the base distribution's httpd. I'd suggest either: 

You should then only see the packages you've set to be removed and installed in the list, and you can confirm the installation to switch over. Any services currently running with php loaded will need to be restarted, for instance httpd or php-fpm. As for this being 'seamless', any software changes happening while users are able to access the website should have the consequences fully understood. Shared libraries being removed and added when a process hasn't already loaded them could potentially load while the shared library isn't there. It's better to do software upgrades like this offline, and preferably tested on a non-production machine first to verify the process works as expected. 3 . To switch to a hypothetical CentOS base php54 package (CentOS 5 used php53 prefix), you just run the above steps replacing php removal with php54w removal, and php54w installation with php54 installation e.g. 

You can delegate control of IIS sites and applications to users, much like you can delegate rights to objects in Active Directory. See the link for instructions. A few more links to help out: $URL$ $URL$ $URL$ $URL$ 

As an alternative, racksolutions.com has a few universal kits that fit just about anything I throw at them. No slides, but better than buying a shelf. 

You may want to give squid a try, if you're not using it already. It's a data-caching application for commonly transferred data. It may not be able to cache Windows Updates, but it should help you save bandwidth, which seems to be your goal. $URL$ 

I know you already accepted an answer, but I hate Putty and there IS another tool out there for Windows users. A lot of people say Putty is the best - probably because it's the only tool they know about for Windows clients. I thought it was the only option as well until I found Poderosa. It offers multiple panes/sessions per window, multiple tabs, simple font/color customizations, background images/colors - and probably a few more things I haven't found yet. It's the only tool I use now for telnet/ssh/console(serial) terminal shell sessions. It might be what you're looking for. 

This should be put above any conflicting RewriteCond/Rule's, so they wont interfere with the redirection. Any .htaccess files in subdirectories will by default remove this rule and not do the redirect. To fix them, you must add either the rule again to them, or set them to inherit from parent .htaccess files, e.g.: 

Actually, I probably wouldn't use my other answer in some situations, but I'll keep it there for reference. If your colleague has been given their own VirtualHost, I would set that virtualhost to output their logs to a different directory, so that they would only see errors for their system: 

2 . You need to first see what existing installed packages need replacing, you can do this by using yum shell to combine removing php-common and installing php54w-common in one transaction (so shared dependencies aren't removed) 

Perhaps this is because the Webtatic 5 package was built earlier than 6. I could add to the build process something that would update the timestamp, however there was never any plan to have Webtatic 5 support CentOS 6, so you may get other unexpected results if you try to use it on that version. A workaround for now would be to force Yum to spot the file has changed: 

72.165.117.130 is one of our private (MPLS) WAN addresses that routes to 63.145.168.58. I'm trying to forward traffic sent to that address to an internal device at 10.0.1.40. Is that all there is to creating a one-to-one NAT, or am I missing something? 

I hosted with TierraNet many years ago. They were a great company then, and were very responsive to my requests for help. I haven't used any of their services in a few years, however, so I am not sure if anything has changed. I currently host with Media Temple, but they don't register .me. GoDaddy and Network Solutions are two other big names that a lot of my clients use and have success with - they are both on the domain.me list of registrars. Personally, I can't stand trying to navigate the GoDaddy website - but to each their own. 

I'm having some trouble trying to figure out the technical details of the below design; specifically in the area of the redundant load-balancers. The web servers are running Windows Server 2003 R2 64 and serve .NET applications via IIS. The database servers are running Windows Server 2008 Enterprise 64 in a SQL Server Failover Cluster with SQL Server 2008. There are currently two web servers and two database servers. What I am looking to accomplish: 

As Electrawn mentions, the libmcrypt package is now in the Webtatic repo, it was depending on the EPEL repository, but not everyone has this installed. As for the php54w-mysql installing MySQL 5.5 issue, this was resolved 6th May: $URL$ 

Without adding an additional external repository, you wont get a later version of git. See this article for getting Git 1.7 via yum: $URL$ 

This will allow www-data into the folder for reading, but only give the git user write access. Any other user can't do anything. If you want to add additional writers, I would add another group git-writers and add the users and git to it as well as the git-readers group, then use the following structure: 

Have you set up yum priorities? RPMForge has subversion and mod_dav_svn 1.6.13, so they should be listed in installations and updates. Yum priorities will hide them if another higher priority repo has the same package names. If so, you will need to add exclude patterns to your /etc/yum.repos.d/CentOS-Base.repo file, by adding to the [base] section: 

The most secure way of doing it I would say is to have a group called git-readers add git and www-data to it, then have the following folder structure: 

You could configure Squid on the server to allow the proxying of Yum from the private subnet to the Redhat update servers. It can also cache packages, meaning it will only download a package once for all updates. $URL$ 

FTP data (including login credentials) is transmitted in plain text, which is why it is so insecure. You definitely want to start making a habit of using SFTP as your data would be encrypted then. 

We have a single-domain forest, and a handful of different file servers. One file server in particular has me worried: it is hosting a lot of important data on independent disks and no backup has ever been done. It's also running Windows XP Pro. I've already taken steps to bring in a backup system (not just for this server, but a larger solution). My problem is really to do with setting up this system for redundancy - I need that data to stay online, or at least be very quickly recoverable (waiting for backups to restore is going to be too slow). The current system setup (after a few maintenance windows) has 3, 1TB SATA drives. C is the system volume. Volume F contains all of the shared directories, and volume E is completely empty. No money is going to be spent on this box, so what I want to do is move all the shared directories to the OS volume as a temporary backup while I delete both the E and F partitions, mirror the disks in Disk Management, format the mirrored volume, and copy the shares back onto the now-mirrored volume. My question is this: are there any tools to help me copy the shares to other volumes and automatically re-create the share at the new physical location with the share/ntfs security permissions intact or am I stuck doing this manually? Update So it turns out that XP doesn't support mirrored disks anyway. Bleh. Not used to dealing with XP performing server roles... Decided it would be best to schedule a backup to retain copies of the data on the open disk until management can figure out a budget for a real file server. 

proxy_redirect will only rewrite redirect headers, not the HTML content needed for this to work. There is no easy way to rewrite the HTML content in Nginx. There is the HttpSubModule, which you can manually add text substitutions, but is lengthly to set up each substitution: $URL$ It is easliest if possible to just update the content at $URL$ to have the redirected path in instead. 

CentOS 6.4 broke backwards compatibility in some library versions, and so latest Webtatic builds only support CentOS 6.4 for some packages (most of the PHP packages are unaffected). If you can update your CentOS 6.x version to 6.4, that would solve the issue. CentOS has in recent years started making it hard to fix to earlier releases to try to push users to the latest release. It's not an ideal situation for servers that can't be upgraded, but repositories would have to support each minor release to avoid this situation. 

If there are other packages than php* in this list then you can't seamlessly switch to Webtatic PHP 5.4, but will have to investigate alternatives. Webtatic has replacement packages for all base php packages (see the packages listed on the page linked to in 1. for confirmation), so there should be no issues, unless you use other 3rd party repositories that have packages installed dependent on the specific php version installed. For the rest of the installation (still in yum shell), you just remove these packages and install their php54w-* counterparts:
