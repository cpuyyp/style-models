The ecological footprint is the impact of a person or community on the environment, expressed as the amount of land required to sustain their use of natural resources. A global hectare (gha) from Wikipedia: 

Wildfires are mainly caused by humans (or their technology) and lightning. Lightning is the most prolific natural source. There really aren't many other sources in most areas, unless there is volcanic activity or a meteor strike as you mention. There are also occasional cases of wildfire when peat dries out. During a hot-dry summer, it can take several days of rain to moisten vegetation enough so that the fire danger is curtailed. If there is a little rain accompanied by lightning, it is probably much less than what is needed to lower the fire potential (dryness of vegetation). Furthermore, lightning strikes are not "usually accompanied by rain". In the Pacific Northwest, for example, there are several lightning-caused wildfires every summer in areas where summer rain is quite scarce. This is discussed a little in Wikipedia: 

The atmosphere is dynamic both horizontally and vertically. You cannot provide services like weather forecasts without a true measurement of the atmospheric conditions in the troposphere and stratosphere across the globe. Satellite retrievals also rely upon measured vertical profiles for calibration of the final products. $URL$ 

You should try to use the equations and maps presented by Mitrovica et al., (2011), entitled On the robustness of predictions of sea level fingerprints. In this paper they present the history of sea level rise equations and then present their own robust equation with comparisons. There are maps showing the differences as well. Soon they will provide fortran code so that you can try it out yourself, which will be published here. 

The original question asked why there were no hurricanes in the southern hemisphere. The answer given: It really is just a naming convention based on location. You can see in the wikipedia article here: $URL$ , it says: 

Sounds like you want a dataset that is unadjusted for rainfall. I'm not sure what you have to gain from that, but there are ways to do it. One way to do this would be to find the inverse correlation between rain and black carbon concentrations, and extrapolate to zero rainfall. Or, if you have any months that have zero rainfall, you could use that for other months where temperature is similar (thus the mixing layer should be similar). This would all need to be done for each location separately, so that source contributions weren't mixed up. 

What don't we know about sustainable agriculture/aquaculture and biodiversity? Specifically, what topics within these disciplines offer the most opportunity for new research that could significantly change our understanding of the processes involved? I am interested in unanswered questions, conundrums, and significant discoveries whose potential impacts have yet to be fully realized in mainstream knowledge. 

Radiative efficiency is the radiative forcing per unit change in halocarbon mixing ratio. Radiative Efficiency assumes that the Radiative Forcing is linear in mixing ratio—this is normally appropriate in the case of small perturbations in mixing ratio about current concentrations and is also appropriate for CFCs. To calculate it requires a radiative transfer model, which includes both analytical and theoretical contributions. The diagram shown in Hodnebrog et al.: "Global warming potentials and radiative efficiencies of halocarbons and related compounds: A comprehensive review" in Reviews of Geophysics ( $URL$ ) explains how radiative efficiency is calculated and is pasted below: 

The south pole has a continent covering it, which allows the retention of relatively long and cold storms, compared to the North Pole. The north pole is covered by water and is not an elevated land mass, so it is a bit warmer on average. Polar stratospheric clouds have chemistry on the ice particles that leads to catalytic ozone depletion (mainly caused by human emissions of CFCs). The colder it is... the more of this can occur. From $URL$ 

Check out $URL$ . NOx from airplanes near/in the stratosphere increases ozone formation plus aerosols help form contrails... both of which increases warming. If the airplane emissions aren't in the stratosphere, then the chemistry and lifetime of those non-CO2 emissions are not nearly as potent. 

This equates to a measurement of ~40% land in the northern hemisphere. This agrees with the northern hemisphere azimuthal equal-area map image below. 

The climate impacts of CO2 are not constrained to the location they are emitted, but rather the whole globe will feel the effects. CO2 is a long-lived molecule that takes 100+ years to convert or deposit. The troposphere, though, only takes months to mix. There are longer times for mixing between the north/south hemispheres, (e.g. over a year), but it is still short relative to the lifetime of CO2 in the atmosphere. Globally, you can expect about a 2% variance of CO2 distributions in the well-mixed troposphere. Here is a recent paper on CO2 distribution from M. Diallo et al.: Global distribution of CO2 in the upper troposphere–stratosphere. The image below (Fig 6a) shows CO2 distribution for different months in color while the isolines are for potential temperature. 

I believe you could use pyranometer data at various elevations to get a non-spectral measurement of the total irradiance received at the Earth's surface. From here: $URL$ 

For these reasons, ice near the coast of Antarctica typically is lost much faster than ice in the mountains. 

It seems you have downloaded a native format file. This is not an HDF readable format. If you see the first link you've given, under distribution it notes there are several formats you can download: Native, Image (J2KBW, JPEGBW, PNGBW, TIFFBW), BUFR, or netCDF. If you want to use HDF libraries to read the file, you will need to download the netCDF formatted files. netCDF is compliant with HDF5 libraries. 

Radiative transfer through the atmosphere is specific to pressure, temperature, and wavelength. So in order to calculate the contribution of greenhouse gases you need to know their concentration distribution both vertically and horizontally not to mention an accurate representation of the atmospheric conditions. It's not one general function... it's millions of functions that all get integrated together and vary dynamically in time and space. I suggest you look at the HITRAN database for the complexities in absorption potential of different greenhouse gases. You may also be interested in climate sensitivity paramaters. From wikipedia $URL$ : "For coupled atmosphere-ocean global climate models (e.g. CMIP5) the climate sensitivity is an emergent property: it is not a model parameter, but rather a result of a combination of model physics and parameters. By contrast, simpler energy-balance models may have climate sensitivity as an explicit parameter. (ΔTs) = λ (ΔRF) The terms represented in the equation relate radiative forcing (RF) to linear changes in global surface temperature change (ΔTs) via the climate sensitivity λ." This is convenient because if you know the change in concentration of a gas and the corresponding RF you can compute a change in surface temperature. Though, I believe the climate sensitivity parameters are particularly for certain time and concentration regimes. 

I understand that cumulonimbus clouds can create lightning, but do not understand how many of them create lightning. I would assume that most multi-cell systems would have lightning, while single cell systems would have less of a chance at creating lightning. Is that right? What percentage of cumulonimbus clouds create lightning?
