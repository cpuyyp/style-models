Well, the thing to do first is to determine if the crank arm is bent (or loose/poorly fitted to the shaft). Prop the bike up and "pedal" it backwards with your hand (from the right side). Observe whether the shaft of the pedal maintains the same horizontal alignment all the way around. If the crank arm is bent then generally the pedal shaft will be "pointing upward" at the top of the crank cycle and "pointing down" at the bottom of the crank cycle, and you can usually both see this and sense it with your hand. (Note that a bent pedal shaft can produce the same symptom, though. But if the pedal shaft is bent it will be obvious if you unscrew the pedal -- the shaft will "wag" around as you unscrew it. And either way you'll need to replace some components.) It should be noted that, on bikes with 3 front sprockets, the right pedal sticks out from the frame slightly more than the left pedal, making your ankle slightly more apt to bump the right crank arm than the left. But the difference is slight -- maybe 4mm. 

If you're talking about a derailleur-style bike, a quick check is to suspend the rear wheel somehow (sometimes you can hang the nose of the seat on something, eg, or see if the rental place doesn't have a work stand) and crank the pedals with your hand while you shift through the gears. On a bike with indexed shifters the transitions should be smooth and you should hear no more than very slight "chatter" from the chain once the transition is complete. 

Assuming I know what you mean by "judder", properly adjusted cantilever brakes with decent pads will not do that. They will screech and sometimes vibrate (as will all caliper brakes) when not properly toed-in, or with worn pads, but proper adjustment (and pad replacement as needed) should fix that. 

From what I read it used to be a pretty good brand -- what one might buy if they were a dedicated amateur rider but not uber-rich. But apparently they never made it out of the early 90s, when frame-building technology changed (and it became impossible to compete on price with the larger automated manufacturers). Here is a web site on them: $URL$ 

For one thing, if you cycle with traffic the closing speed between car and bike is the DIFFERENCE in speed between the two. If you're doing 20mph and the car is doing 45, the closing speed is 25. Reverse it and the closing speed is 65 -- over twice as fast. This affects the time the driver has to react to the cyclist's presence -- over twice as much time to see the cyclist, slow down, plan to pass, etc. Another thing: If you cycle with traffic and the car behind you does not have room to pass he need only slow down to your speed until the way is clear. If you're riding against traffic there's no real option for him to slow down until it's clear to proceed. In practical terms, this means that in the first case the driver will very likely wait until it's at least halfway safe to pass, while in the second case even a relatively tame, careful driver is apt to try to scoot past somehow, even if there is not safe clearance. And, combining the two, if it's not safe to pass the driver can slow down just a little, from 45 to 35, say, and cut his closing speed to 15mph, giving him a much longer time to work out a passing strategy. Going the other way, slowing 10mph reduces closing speed from 65 to 55, not a significant change. 

Some of these are "stock", while others are fairly highly customized "one-off" bikes. (But several versions of the basic tricycle recumbent are available "off the shelf" at relatively reasonable prices.) I never seen any of these bike styles with an auxiliary motor, but I'm sure there are some. Several battery-assist systems are available for standard bikes and could be easily adapted to a recumbent. A full-power gasoline engine would be a bit more complicated. 

For a standard bike in normal use you should not, from the seat, be able to touch the ground (without leaning, or except, perhaps, on extreme tip-toe). A standard diamond frame (with horizontal top bar), for road use, should be sized so that you can stand flat-footed over the top bar with a "comfortable" margin (but no more) between the bar and the stuff above the bar. (A bike used off-road will generally be a bit more compact, and, of course, the top bar is often not horizontal.) The seat should be positioned so that your leg is almost fully extended at the bottom of the stroke (the knee should not go perfectly straight). One way to fit the seat height is to have someone hold the bike while you pedal backwards with your heels on the pedals. With your heels on the pedals the knees should go perfectly straight at the bottom of the stroke, but with no need to rock side-to-side to maintain contact with the pedals. (Once you switch to using your toes on the pedals in a normal fashion the proper almost-straight leg extension is obtained.) Off-road, and for stunt riding, generally the seat will be a bit lower, and some may find it convenient to lower the seat a bit for city riding. But be aware that a too-low seat puts significant strain on the knees and can lead to knee injury (especially when combined with riding in a too-difficult gear). 

Whether you put the weight in a backpack or a pannier, it's still weight on the bike -- makes no difference in the effort needed to move the bike (other than the differences in wind resistance). Generally, for better handling, it's best to keep weight as low on the bike as possible. And whether distributed front or rear makes little difference on (non-technical) uphills (though some tourists feel that having weight in front panniers actually improves stability on downhills and rough roads, so long as the weight is well-secured and can't flop around). [On reflection, I can see that a loaded backpack might noticeably improve climbing or accelerating while standing, since the backpack weight would place more weight on the pedals.] In warm weather or for long rides, the backpack inhibits cooling and collects sweat. However, there is a major convenience factor to the backpack in that you can easily take the stuff with you when you dismount the bike. (Note that you should never put any substantial weight in a handlebar bag -- they are universally too poorly secured and flop around, impairing handling. Weight in a seat bag should be well-secured with cinch straps around the bulk of the bag.) 

In general, if the hole is bigger than a "puncture" then you'll have trouble with the tube wanting to peek through. This depends to a degree on the thickness of the tube -- lightweight tubes will obviously be worse in this regard than heavier, thicker tubes. Any time there is such a hole the tire should be "booted". I'd have no real problem riding a bike with a 1/2cm hole, well booted, though I'd not leave on a week-long tour that way (which reminds me ... better change that tire!). I recall seeing a case about 5 years back where the tire had split along the bead for a distance of several inches. Being as this was on a trail, several miles from the nearest road where the accompanying repair van could come, the bike owner and several of his buddies performed a "repair" using medical adhesive tape wrapped around the tire (but not the rim) -- a very delicate procedure. This repair was sufficient to make it to the next town. I still kick myself that I didn't think to take a picture. 

Visit a orthopedist or at least a medically-qualified physical therapist to find out which variety of knee pain you're experiencing (there are several different knee pain syndromes) and what therapy you should use for it. Very often the right exercises (eg, straight leg lifts) can make a world of difference. 

You went at it backwards. First thing to do (after backing off the limit adjustments a bit) is to adjust the barrel adjuster so that you can hit middle gear, then adjust the upper and lower limits so that you hit the outer two without going too far. Then you can "tweak" the barrel adjuster slightly so that you minimize chain rub at the rear without upsetting clean shifting to the middle gear at the front (then "tweak" the limits again). 

I suspect that the main cause is riding in the rain. Being wet increases the friction between glove and bar and between palm and glove. You then unconsciously "take advantage" of the increased friction to hold your hand at an angle of rotation relative to the bar that would not be possible dry. The skin of your palm gets "scrunched up" as it resists twisting on the bar. 

It sounds like the cable's slipping after you adjust it. Precisely how you adjust the cable depends on the brake design, and normally you would not shorten the straddle cable, since it needs to be a certain length for optimum operation. However, with many newer bikes the main cable makes up half the straddle cable, with a spacer to maintain the proper straddle length. Sheldon Brown has an article on cantilever adjustment, though it's a little short on actual adjustment operations. Park Tool's article, on the other hand, almost goes into too much detail. 

If you'll be riding on ice, you definitely need studded tires. For snow, you need wider tires than the typical road bike -- more of a mountain/hybrid tire, with a lugged design. How wide depends on how deep and soft the snow will be. Fenders are generally not a good idea since they'll tend to get clogged with snow. For clothing you don't need anything super-special vs what you'd wear for that cold of a temp anyway -- your typical tight-fitting cycling clothes will shed snow pretty well. But if you're not familiar with riding in the cold, you need a "wind shell" that will prevent the wind from penetrating into your clothing and wrecking its insulating value. Some cold-weather wind shells are more wind-proof on the front than on the back, and this is a good thing, since it still lets your clothing "breathe" fairly well. What you wear under the shell depends on how cold it gets -- think layers. Avoid cotton -- look for wool or man-made materials designed to "wick" moisture, such as CoolMax. Just keep in mind that you will get warm quickly while cycling, and it's more of a challenge to stay cool (and not sweaty) rather than warm. For your hands, it's a good idea to wear "glove liners" under your regular cycling gloves, then something like lightweight ski mitts over the cycling gloves in cold weather. (Glove liners are thin, tight-fitting gloves typically knit from blue/purple polypropylene.) Lots of theories on feet. Simplest is probably a pair of neoprene rubber cycling booties. They can be cut to let "clipless" pedal cleats fit through, if you want to use those. There's a web site -- $URL$ -- that has lots of good info on cold-weather cycling, even though it apparently hasn't been updated in 5 years. 

The traditional bike label is a decal. This is essentially the same sort of decal you used to botch while trying to apply it to the wing of a model airplane as a kid, except that, after application, a solvent is applied to dissolve the decal and cause it to "become one with" the paint/varnish. A hobby shop would have the solvent used for decals -- you could try a little of that and see if it loosens the decal. But keep in mind that a layer of varnish may have been applied over the whole mess. 

By "gears" I assume you're talking about the rear sprockets, or perhaps the smallest front sprocket, since they're about the only "gears" that are made of steel. And they shouldn't get rusty if properly oiled. A little rust won't hurt the sprockets. Just oil the chain with good chain oil and it will transfer to the sprockets fairly readily -- the rust will wear off with a little use. More worrisome is the chain itself, since a little rust can hurt a chain, causing "frozen links" and accelerating wear. Again, oil it with proper bike chain oil. 

The first thing to do is to tighten the cranks -- on both sides. If the problem is a loose crank (which you may not detect by simply shaking the crank), then riding with it loose will destroy the crank in short order. After that, my next suspicion would be a loose bottom bracket cartridge. But even a bad pedal bearing can produce similar symptoms. (And Joe's suggestion to check for something physically hitting something else is a good one.)
