Fraction of photometric nights (really no clouds/cirrus) per year and/or the fraction of night where spectroscopic observations can be done (some clouds, thin cirrus). The best sites are up at the 60% and 80% level for these. You would also include time lost due to high winds The median astronomical seeing and its distribution from night to night - the full width half maximum of astronomical images. At the best sites this is around 0.5 arcsec on the best nights. Median extinction. The amount the atmosphere absorbs for a star at zenith. Typically quoted in the V-band and just below 0.1 mag at the best sites. Brightness of the dark, moonless sky in mag per square arcsecond. Often quoted in the V or B bands. A value of 21.5-22 mag/sqarcsec is a good site. 

You don't say what other information you have for the "several stars". Yes, you can use a mass-luminosity relationship if the stars are on the main sequence. In terms of mass uncertainties I would estimate that you might be at the level of 20% unless you can absolutely pinpoint them on a Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, because the luminosity of a (fixed mass) main sequence star changes, even whilst it is on the main sequence. If the stars are in any other phase of their evolution then your problem is much harder, even if you can place them on the HR diagram. Not least because there is considerable disagreement between different evolutionary models as regards the positions of stars of a given mass at a given age, on both the pre- and post-main sequence. Furthermore, their luminosity and temperature evolution can be influenced by factors such as rotation, metallicity, magnetic fields and mass-loss. Compact stellar remnants and brown dwarfs do not follow a mass-luminosity relation. In general you can only estimate their masses if they are in binary systems, or for white dwarfs, you can estimate their radii and either their surface gravity or gravitational redshift. Estimating a brown dwarf's mass needs both its luminosity and age. 

Yes, there are many. One of the first, if not the first was the radio lensed quasar B1938+666, in which a near-IR Einstein ring was reported by King et al. (1998). The answer to your real question though is not as straightforward as that. Although lensing should be wavelength independent (according to GR), it is not independent of the size and position of the source. The radio waves and optical emission arise from different source sizes and locations. In addition, if you are interested in testing whether the surface brightness magnification is the same, well that relies on knowing the intrinsic source properties; and the radio to optical brightness of quasars varies wildly. 

A partial answer to your question emerged today on arXiv. Hippke (2017) analyses this exact problem - dealing with power requirements for the transmitter, arrangements for detection, the information transfer rate, extinction etc. etc. Their conclusion is that there is no problem in principle with getting something to work at about 1 bit/s per Watt of power that the probe can obtain from photovoltaic power and if a dedicated 39-m telescope is observing the probe using a coronagraphic imager. They also conclude that the best wavelength to work at is 400nm for a ground-based receiving telescope and 300 nm if a 10-m space based telescope is available. The basic transmission device is a $\sim 1$m diameter telescope, firing a coherent laser beam back towards Earth. The data rate scales as the area of the transmitting telescope. They do not discuss how such a thing could be built or sent to $\alpha$ Cen. A promised follow-up paper is to discuss the use of gravitational lensing to improve signal-to-noise. 

How would you get a magnetar close to Mars, within the solar system? OK, let's leave that to one side, but the Earth's magnetic field is of order $10^{-4}$ Tesla at strongest. As the dipole field of a magnetar diminishes as $r^{-3}$ and could be as high as $10^{11}$ Teslas at the surface of the magnetar, at a radius of 10 km, then the magnetar woud need to be at a distance of $10^{6}$ km to surround Mars with a field of $10^{-4}$ Tesla. The problem is that the radiation coming from the magnetar in the form of charged particles accelerated from the magnetic poles would completely dwarf the charged particle radiation from the Sun at Mars. So no, a nearby Magnetar would not save Mars' atmosphere - quite the reverse. EDIT: A BOTE calculations: If we look at the Crab pulsar - not quite a magnetar, but close - it is calculated that 10% of the rotational KE being lost ends up in synchrotron raiation from charged particles. That's about $10^{30}$ Watts. So there is at least $\sim 10^4$ solar luminosities, just in the kinetic energy of relativistic particles. Magnetars are also very strong and variable sources of hard X-ray and Gamma ray radiation. Typical magnetar bursts/flares can release $10^{7}-10^{9}$ solar luminosities of hard X-rays and Gamma rays over periods of 1-40 s. That should fry any atmosphere (or anything else) that was only $10^{6}$ km away! 

Neither statement is true, just like the statement that the "Earth orbits the Sun" is not strictly speaking true. In truth, if we are talking about a system with two masses, what happens is that they both orbit their common centre of gravity. Whether we perceive that one object orbits another is really just a question of their mass ratio. In the example shown below, the smaller, less massive object might be said to orbit the larger object and follows the red path. However, the larger object also executes a smaller circular orbit shown in green, with the same orbital period. Both objects actually orbit the centre of the picture, which is the centre of gravity of the system. In many cases - e.g. a planet like Earth and a star like the Sun or a satellite around the Earth, the mass ratio is so small, that it does make sense to make the approximation that one object orbits another. 

This paragraph illustrates that the potential and the ideas were there, but it also illustrates why it was difficult to get funding and access to telescopes to pursue these ideas. The expected timescales for these small variations in radial velocities were years and decades and the expected signals were about at the limits of the precisions of the instruments at hand. Other astronomers were not convinced that such absolute accuracy could be maintained over such long durations. What changed everything was the discovery of "hot Jupiters" in orbits of only a few days and which caused radial velocity variations that were bigger than the precisions that spectrographs were capable of - especially the newly developed iodine cells (see Marcy & Butler 1992). So, I do not think it is the case that exoplanet hunters were "ignored and ridiculed", it is simply that planetary formation scenarios did not permit the formation of "hot Jupiters" and thus nobody expected that planets could be detected with the available technology without observing stars for years, if not decades. It thus required time on telescopes that was dedicated to this purpose. As it turns out, and with the benefit of hindsight, anyone with a CCD camera and a modest sized telescope can identify the transits of hot Jupiters. But even if someone had gone out on a limb and searched for such a thing systematically, they would have been unable to confirm their discovery (as opposed to the vast numbers of possible false positive transit signals) without spectroscopic backup to confirm the planetary mass of the companion. The first transiting planet was found by searching for transits among hot Jupiters identified by the doppler method.
