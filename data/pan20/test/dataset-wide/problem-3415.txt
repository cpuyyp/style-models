Consider the Correlated Random Effects model $y_{it} = \alpha + x_{it}\beta + \bar x \gamma + w_i + \epsilon_{it} $ where $x_{it}$ is a scalar explanatory variable. The correlated random effects GLS estimator $ \hat \beta_{CRE} $ is the OLS estimator of $\beta$ in the quasi-demeaned regression $\tilde y_{it} = \delta + \tilde x_{it} \beta + \bar x_i \rho + u_{it} $, where $\tilde y_{it} = y_{it} - \theta \bar y_i , \tilde x_{it} = x_{it} - \theta \bar x_i $ and $\theta = 1 - (\sigma^2_\epsilon/ (\sigma^2_\epsilon + T\sigma^2_w))^{1/2} $ Question: I need to show that the residuals from the regression of $x_{it} - \bar x_i $ on a constant and $\bar x_i $ is just $x_{it} - \bar x_i $ itself. Attempt: Regress $x_{it} - \bar x_i = \alpha + \bar x_{i} + \tilde r_{it} $ rearrange to get the residuals, $\tilde r_{it} = (x_{it} - \bar x_i) - (\alpha + \bar x_{i})$ I'm not sure how to proceed. 

Equilibrium conditions will require, among other things,: 1.) $MRS_{a,b}^i=MRS_{a,b}^j \forall [i,j] \in N$ , $N$ the set of agents 2.) $MRTS_{x,y}^i=MRTS_{x,y}^j \forall [i,j] \in J$ , $J$ the set of firms 3.) $MRT=MRS$ (Assuming that 1,2 hold) And I note that 1,2 are efficiency conditions. 3 is efficiency in the output market. Why? Suppose 1,2 hold at: 

Let's assume we have an increasing production function $f:\mathbb{R^+} \to \mathbb{R^+}$ Now, assume this production function is concave and that the price of input z is fixed (this is a single-input and single output case). I want to show this implies the corresponding cost function $C^f(w,q)$ is convex. My thoughts: let $z,z' \in \mathbb{R^+}$ where W.L.O.G $z'>z$ and let $f(z)=q$ and $f(z')=q$ Since $f$ is concave, we take $\alpha \in [0,1]$ $s.t$: $$f(\alpha z +(1- \alpha)z') \geq \alpha f(z) +(1- \alpha)f(z')$$ let $\alpha z +(1- \alpha)z'=z''\in \mathbb{R^+}$ where by necessity $z\leq z'' \leq z'$ Since cost of $z=w$ is fixed at some $w \in \mathbb{R^+}$ we can rewrite our cost function as $C^f(q)$ which is convex if for $\alpha \in [0,1]$: $$C(\alpha q +(1- \alpha)q') \leq \alpha c(q) +(1- \alpha)c(q')$$ Now, since $f$ is concave, it cannot be the case that $f$ experiences increasing returns to scale. Then $f$ has constant returns to scale or diminishing returns to scale. Then: Since $z''$ is clearly feasible then we have that: $$C(w,q'') \leq w*z''$$ $$=\alpha w*z + (1- \alpha) w*z'$$ $$= \alpha c(w,q) + (1- \alpha) c(w,q')$$ Does this look correct? 

After the Chinese central bank removed the peg against USD, yuan appreciated but Chinese exports didn't seem to be affected. They are steadily increasing. How can this be explained ? 

No one knows. It is very easy to explain crises in hindsight but to predict one is almost unpredictable. It is a very bold statement that I am making but it is true. It is almost impossible to predict and prevent crises. The system is not designed to do that. Economists try to design the system in such a way that it can tolerate crises not to prevent them. Former secretary Timothy Geithner mentions in an online lecture that the economic system is like a highway. You can put a speed limit of 10 miles per hour then there would be no accidents but then it won't serve the purpose of its existence at all. You have to make the trade-off. Nevertheless, the safeguards that are put in place after the Global Financial Crisis are more stringent across the world. 

I will answer this because it is relatively easy and because I assume future students might be curious about how to show this. However, you really don't deserve for me to just answer your homework question and so I will give an outline rather than a step-by-step answer. Suppose the following CD production function (I am omitting labor so that you can't just copy the parts of this that I complete): $$U(K) =A K^{\alpha}$$ To show this production function has diminishing marginal returns we must show: 1) That the first derivative of this function is positive 2) That the second derivative of this function is negative For an example of 1: $$U'() = \alpha AK^{\alpha-1}$$ this is clearly a positive number and so 1 is satisfied. Now, what about 2? When we take the second derivative here, our leading term is now $(\alpha-1)\alpha$ What do we know about alpha? Is our knowledge of alpha enough to know that the second derivative is negative, as desired? 

There is a sense of differentiation thus this is not competitive market clearly. Government regulations in an industry cannot be regarded as a monopoly as government mostly will decide on a price ceiling or floor and not the quantity of transport supplied. Since there are only 4 firms this is an oligopoly clearly. They can collude to restrict output and raise prices if it is within the limits set by government. Maybe the government has set the price to actually prevent collusion. 

The 19702-73 inflation was a supply side shock, a negative supply shock to be specific. Because of the high oil prices, production cost of almost every rose sharply. Since, this was the first time that such a shock was seen at such large scale it was mostly misunderstood and traditional short term policy tools i.e. easy monetary policy and fiscal stimulus were deployed. What had actually happened was since oil is such an essential part of production, not just the short term but the long term output or the potential output itself was affected and should have been revised. Because of the incorrect diagnosis and policy response, inflation got embedded into the long term expectations and hence it just went into a spiral. 

This is a homework question: $y_t = \alpha y_{t-1} + \beta_0 x_t + \beta_1 x_{t-1} + \epsilon_t , 0<\alpha<1, (t=1,...,T)$ where $x_t$ is an I(1) process independent from $\epsilon_t$ for all $s$ and $t$, and $\epsilon_t , t=1,...,T $ are i.i.d with mean zero and variance $\sigma^2$ Question 1) Suppose that $\beta_0 \not= -\beta_1$. Is it possible that $y_t$ is stationary? 2) Write down the error correction form of the model, showing the relationship between the new parameters and those in the original model. Argue that $y_t$ and $x_t$ are co-integrated and write down the co-integrating vector Any help/pointers would be great. 

I am working with a fixed effects model to estimate the effect of enterprise zones on unemployment claims. (1) $log(uclms_{it}) = \theta_t + \beta_1 ez_{it} + c_i + \epsilon_{it} $ where $\theta_t$ are time specific effects and $c_i$ are city specific effects. Another model is estimated that allows each city to have its own time trend: $log(uclms_{it}) = \gamma_i t + \beta_1 ez_{it} + c_i + \epsilon_{it} $ and this model is then first-differenced to obtain (3) $\Delta log(uclms_{it}) = \gamma_i + \beta_1 \Delta ez_{it} + \Delta \epsilon_{it} $ I was asked to estimate (1) and (3) by fixed effects and comment on possible reasons for differences in the estimate of $\beta_1$ The estimates I got were; from model (1) $\beta_1 = -0.1044$ with a t-ratio of -1.43 and p-value of 0.166. from model (3) $\beta_1 = -0.252$ with a t-ratio of -2.41 and a p-value of 0.025. So the estimate is relatively small in model (1) compared to model (3) and is insignificant in model (1), but significant in model (3) at the 5% level. Am I right in thinking that, when (1) is estimated by FE, the city specific effects drop out, but the time specific effects remain. Whereas in (3) we only have city specific effects which drop out when estimated by FE. So the observed differences in $\beta_1$ arise because (1) includes time effects, but (3) does not. I'm also a bit confused about using first-differenced data in a fixed-effects model. Why would that be useful? 

Commercial banks do a lot of lending and borrowing among each other and that is a sign of healthy flow of money in economy. This is because inter-bank activities ensure that enough credit is available and banks are engaging in lending to businesses, individuals etc. However, sometimes such lending is not what the central bank thinks it should be. Commercial banks may be cautious in lending to public or even to each other. This can happen when there are not enough investment opportunities according to them or because of low market sentiments. Banks at such times play safe and would rather park their money in their central bank accounts in the form of excess reserves. In such situations, when central bank reduces its rates there is less incentive for banks to park their money with it as their could be some other opportunities which could be more profitable. Secondly, the banks would have cheaper credit which can be used to finance their assets, to give loans and in case they face shortage of cash, central bank window is there to help them. Thus, reduction of rates by central bank can have many transmission mechanisms. However, there is absolutely no guarantee that such transmissions will happen. This depends on how the commercial banks receive this. How market reacts to this. Transmissions may take months or even years to complete. Within this period, the economy itself might grow or slow down and hence, the actual effect of these rate cuts or hikes could be just opposite to what the central bank intended. Hence, it's a tricky, inexact science and central banks have to work in a lot of uncertainty. 

This is a bit of a broad answer but your question is a subset of what is contained herein. Yes, the FTSE can decline while the currency decreases in value. Edit: To be explicit, I am omitting an overview of theoretical mechanism because I think BB King's answer suffices if one is interested in theory. If one is instead is instead compelled by empirical evidence, I think this answer suffices. Both responses combine into a very solid answer, I think. 

St. Louis Fed: $URL$ Has very good US data. I am not aware of a database that systematically aggregates city-level data. I recommend state government sites and, for larger cities, city government sites. 

When a country, or perhaps a country's central bank, prints money it is increasing the money supply. When the amount of money available in an economy increases, the value of the currency will decrease. So think about the capital flight from the Euro to the Kroner that is causing the value of that currency to spike. Printing money can basically cause a 'reversal' of sorts. That is, it places downward pressure on the value of the currency. So Denmark's banking authority might have some large stash of Kroner to meet the current demand. It can sell Kroner to counter-balance the new fluctuation in demand to keep its currency's value from spiking. Denmark might make this decision to avoid making its exports more expensive etc. However, it certainly does not have an unlimited supply of money. If it was willing to print an unending amount of money, Denmark's banking authority would actually be manufacturing hyperinflation. I've written this in a non-techinical fashion. Please let me know if you want more details. 

I have studied that accumulation of foreign reserve has the potential to raise inflation levels in economy as the money base increases (= domestic currency + foreign reserve increases) and if it overshoots the money demand in the economy then it will raise price levels. My question here is that how the foreign reserves which are under the custody of the central bank go into the system and cause inflation. Say, China has huge reserves of USD but it rests with the central bank mostly. So, how does it get into the economy and raise prices ? 

Your assertion is in line with 'rational expectations theory'. It says that economic agents will take all available information including the possible policy actions into account and then make decisions and these decisions will affect the future. In contrast to other theories this means that public policy will not be able to affect private decisions (policy ineffectiveness proposition). Rational expectations will counter the effect of public policy. What is mentioned in the paper is quite different from this. Typically, it is assumed that market is information sensitive to public policy.
