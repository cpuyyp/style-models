Keeping your muscles warm reduces the risk of injury. This is, among some other reasons (such as neurological efficiency) why people warm up before doing the actual hard work. If you're doing strength training, there are rest periods between sets of an exercise. Those might be less than two minutes, or substantially longer if you're doing very heavy sets. Keeping warm during that time is useful. In some cases people wear neoprene sleeves over joints (usually knees or elbows) to raise the temperature in those specifically. For cardio, you might see people do the opposite. Long endurance exercise causes a lot of sweating. The sweat needs to evaporate to keep the body at a comfortable temperature. Since the exercise is continuous you're likely to keep up a good temperature in your muscles and joints anyway. This is why clothes for jogging tend to be airier and lighter. All of that depends on other factors, though. The temperature of the environment (is the gym kept warm? is there airco?), the weather (humidity) and, perhaps most importantly, personal preference. For some folks hoodies seem to be a fashion statement, or something that lets them focus or stay in the background. It's not always a practical consideration. Some people like to stay very warm, while others prefer to keep cool. EDIT: I forgot something. Some folks might believe that keeping their body temperature higher will result in more calories being expended and more body fat being utilized. I don't know if there's any truth to that. Intuitively I'd say it sounds doubtful and a case of mistaken cause and effect. People might think it works, because the increase in sweating will result in loss of weight through water. Which, of course, is rapidly regained, especially after replenishing glucose and glycogen stores. 

I would strongly suggest you attempt to train your whole body. Balance is not just good for looks, but for general health. There's always gonna be a weakest link somewhere, which is what will eventually lead to problems later in life. Trying to get that weakest link stronger and not letting it lag behind too much will benefit you. Full-body workouts don't have to take ages. Beginner programs with 3 workouts per week focused on compound lifts, such as Starting Strength and StrongLifts 5x5 will give you the best return on time investment. Allowing your whole body to progress will provide a better balance in physique, which will be perceived as better looking. 

Amino acid and protein supplements don't require cycling or tapering. They simply provide some extra nutrients which you'll already find in food in similar levels. That's it. There's no reason to believe there are any long-term problems with taking them if they don't displace an otherwise healthy diet. Claims that a high-protein diet would be harmful to the kidneys are also total bunk based on the protein restriction prescribed to people who already have kidney dysfunction. 

If intermittent fasting gives you insomnia, the way to solve that is to stop intermittent fasting. The lack of sleep will do more damage to your health, performance and overall well-being than the intermittent fasting would help those things. Find some other way of achieving your goals. 

In these studies there is a comparison between a supine trunk raise (or curl up, a crunch where the chest is raised towards the knees while maintaining leg position) and a posterior pelvic tilt exercise (a lying leg raise, where the pelvis is tilted towards the chest while maintaining upper torso position). The conclusions seem to be that separate portions (upper/lower) of the rectus abdominis can, at least in part, be individually activated. Furthermore, the ratio of the upper rectus abdominis activity to that of the lower, was much greater for the curl up exercise than for the leg raise. So not only do certain exercises seem much more effective than the traditional crunch, it does appear that you can indeed train specifically for upper or lower abdominals, at least where the rectus abdominis is concerned. It seems possible that any exercise where posterior pelvic tilt is favored (which is the case for the captain's chair exercise and reverse crunch) will put emphasis on the lower RA, while exercises favoring the upper trunk (like the traditional crunch) would emphasize the upper RA. I should hasten to say that the studies can't be generalized like that (it's speculation on my part) and also that this concerns relative recruitment of the upper and lower portions. The leg raises still worked the upper RA considerably. 

Getting DOMS when you start working out is normal and after some weeks you probably won't get it anymore, unless you add a sudden increase in workload (beyond your normal progression) or do some exercise you didn't previously do and to which your body hasn't adapted. I've also frequently noticed that it tends to be the worst the second day after working out, and doing a workout while still having it can in fact decrease it. But that might be because a beginner adapts very quickly to any new stimulus. That said, given how it's worse now than before, I believe you are letting the stress you impose on your body exceed its capacity for recovery. So you have two options (or combination thereof): 

You are indeed eating something that causes weight gain: food. Track it. Weigh what you eat, track it in an application such as MyFitnessPal or any of the alternatives, and make absolutely sure you're using a correct entry (correcting based on the food label as necessary) or using, say, values from the USDA database. For whole foods you can often find this straight away typing something into Google (try "cashews" for example). If you want to be precise in finding out where you go wrong and how much you really consume, you need to track. Ignore the fact that many people seem to do just fine not ever paying attention or thinking much about what they eat (other than "what would be tasty today") because it's not working for you. You've got to be precise and turn it into a science. Measure, correct. If I'd had to pick out the foods you listed that would be most tricky, it's 

A little bit of background which might help in appraising the situation. If you want to avoid the fluff, the actual concrete question in bold at the bottom. Up until the start of April this year I've done a linear progression using more or less the Starting Strength model, with some of the typical shenanigans that Mark Rippetoe would not approve of. No powercleans (I can't for the life of me get into the rack position, not that interested in explosive power), added rows. Prior to that I had already done 1.5 years of strength training with very mediocre results, mostly due to a fear of regaining fat and not eating through plateaus. This time I ate like I meant it and the 6 month progress was better than everything before then. I wouldn't say it was a waste experience-wise, though. Now the time has come to lose some of that excess fat, so since the start of April I've introduced a caloric deficit. I'm lowering the calories from week to week rather than directly plummeting to some bottom value, since this is easier to maintain for the planned 12-or-so weeks and seems to avoid the typical weight loss stalls. Regardless of whether I'm right, it seems to work and losing weight is currently easy. Unfortunately, for the past few weeks my motivation to do my workouts has taken a nosedive. I find myself making mental excuses, such as "I'll go to sleep early and get more time for it tomorrow" or go to check some Stack Overflow questions on my laptop and stick around until it seems too late to still go to the gym. I've maintained a rather consistent gym discipline for two years, apart from the occasional bad week, and usually enjoyed my workouts despite self-doubt and grinding through some exercises. So I'm not sure why things have taken this turn. Some reasons I can think of: 

Let's look at the two most prominent nutrients found in lemons that could play a role. These are vitamin C, and citric acid. Lemons are rich in vitamin C. One fruit will deliver from 50% to 75% of the daily recommended amount, depending on the size of the lemon. That's nice, because it is an essential nutrient; humans can't synthesize it in their bodies. Now, does it promote fat loss? Doing a search yields a lot of articles that seem to state so, but many of them are from sources that I deem questionable at best. The source of this idea seems to stem from one study, conducted at the Arizona State University. Here is a link: $URL$ The study observes that fat oxidation was reduced in the test subjects who had a vitamin C deficiency. Note that this does not mean extra vitamin C is going to increase fat oxidation, it only concludes that there appears to be a correlation between vitamin C deficiency and slower fat loss. Articles reporting on such studies often make faulty leaps in logic. They think "if a shortage of something reduces fat loss, then a surplus it of will surely accelerate it!". Unscientific. However, you'll want to avoid a vitamin C deficiency and lemon juice is a good way to do it. So then there's long-term effects. Although long-term consumption of excess vitamin C could be harmful, there's no reason to believe that one lemon each day on top of a regular diet comes anywhere close to such an excess. In fact, there's common foodstuffs much richer in vitamin C which you can eat frequently without any cause for concern. Onto the citric acid. There is a metabolic pathway in your body called the "citric acid cycle" that plays a major role in the energy supply to tissues, not in the least your muscles. One of the metabolites needed in this cycle is citrate, a derivative of citric acid. So getting some extra from your food seems like a good idea. Anything bad about citric acid? Dosages that are too large can cause side-effects, but again, one lemon is not going to get you even close to that amount. You'd probably have to take medicinal concentrations to be at risk. The only long-term effect I can think of is that frequent consumption could affect the tooth enamel. Since you're adding sugar and salt (creating a sort of homebrew isotonic drink) it could be comparable to some sodas, although I suspect your drink is less damaging to teeth than, say, a cola. If it worries you, perhaps use a straw, or avoid letting it wash over your teeth when taking a sip. EDIT: I'll add another consideration. Apart from the vitamin C and citric acid discussed above, lemons also contain specific polyphenols. Here is a study that investigates the effect of those polyphenols in modulating the weight gain in mice when provided with a diet that would induce obesity: $URL$ The conclusion of the study is that a positive effect can be seen in reducing weight gain in the form of fat when supplementing the diet with these polyphenols. Since this is a study on rodents you can draw no hard conclusions on how it will affect humans, and it wouldn't prove that lemons would actually assist in weight loss, it only suggests they can have a positive effect in slowing weight gain. So in summary:
