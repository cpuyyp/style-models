Source Some people suggest that the relics were brought to the Vatican, where they still remain. I haven't seen any evidence for this claim, but it is at least possible. Do we have any information about what happened to these relics? 

The closest thing we have to a Jewish text in which Jesus makes claims about himself - whether as the messiah, the son of God, or anything else - is Josephus' Antiquities of the Jews. Josephus was a well educated, relatively well-to-do Jewish man, who became an officer in the Jewish rebel army during the Jewish Revolt. He led a unit of soldiers until they were captured by the Romans; Josephus wisely chose to become a turncoat in order to save his neck. He began to work with the Romans as an advisor, ultimately going so far as to attempt to negotiate an end to the prolonged siege of Jerusalem. The negotiations failed, the city was sacked, the Temple was torn down, and everyone inside the city walls was slaughtered. Many Jews have held this treachery against Josephus ever since. After the end of the war, the Jews were scattered and diminished in numbers, and Josephus, probably realizing that he was persona non grata, moved to Rome, where he became a court historian to the Emperor. He was contracted to write a history of the revolt, and later, a general history of the Jewish people. These records are incredibly important, and provide an insight into a period of time which is difficult to study due to the mass carnage and destruction caused by the revolt. Josephus' works contain two alleged references to Jesus, but one of them is almost universally regarded as a forgery inserted by later Christian scribes who were tasked with copying the manuscript. I won't include the spurious passage here, but I can summarize the reasons for it being dismissed as a fake. Everything we know about Josephus suggests that he remained a committed Jew his entire life, and had no relationship with the followers of Jesus. Yet the spurious passage would have us believe that Josephus believed that Jesus was indeed the messiah, he performed miracles, he was divine, and he was resurrected. There is absolutely no chance whatsoever that Josephus would have written such a thing. If he had actually believed these things, he would have joined the Jesus Movement, rather than remaining a Jew. The scholarly consensus is nearly unanimous in saying that this passage, known as the Testimonium Flavianum, is a later forgery. The other reference to Jesus in Josephus, on the other hand, is widely regarded as authentic. For starters, it doesn't say anything that would be problematic for a Jewish author; it also rings true because it mentions Jesus only in passing, and he is not the focus of the story. A little background information will be useful to provide the necessary context of the story. It appears that the only person who was authorized to order an execution in Roman Judaea was the proconsul - in Jesus' time, this office was held by Pontius Pilate. The Romans understood that the political situation in Judaea was complex, and frequently quite tense. Therefore, they chose to use the Temple priests as intermediaries between the Roman government and the Jewish people in the province. The priests were appointed by the Romans, usually through shady exchanges of money and influence. Josephus' account describes a chain of events set in motion by the death of the proconsul, a man named Porcius Festus. It took some time for word of the proconsul's death to reach Rome - probably a couple of months - and a similar amount of time for the replacement, Lucceius Albinus, to arrive in Jerusalem. In the interim, the High Priest, whose name was Ananus, decided to exploit the power vacuum by disposing of some troublemakers. It seems that Ananus had come into conflict with James, the brother of Jesus, who had replaced Jesus as the leader of the disciples following the crucifixion. It is thought that Ananus may have tried to convince the Romans to have James killed, but the Romans refused on the grounds that James hadn't broken any laws. With the Romans now out of the picture for the time being, Ananus had James executed, along with other unnamed parties. The people of Jerusalem seem to have been fond of James, probably because of his reputation for being committed to charity and collecting alms for the poor, widows, and orphans. They were also upset that Ananus had exceeded his lawful authority. When Albinus finally arrived in Jerusalem, the people complained about Ananus' actions during the absence of a proconsul. Albinus responded by deposing Ananus and appointing a man named Jesus son of Damneus (no relation to the Christian Jesus, of course). 

These sentiments were not limited to civilians; a well known General said, speaking in large part about Jews: 

After the Irish War of Independence (also known as The [Black and] Tan War), the Irish and British signed a treaty in 1921, which created the Irish Free State and started the process of gradual independence from British rule. The Irish Republican Army, which had been the primary military force on the Irish side, split in reaction to the treaty, because it failed to grant their demands: 

A More In-Depth Explanation: While Jesus was alive, he stayed away from cities until literally the last week or so of his life. He seems to have done so deliberately, although the reason for this is the subject of some debate. The explanation that makes the most sense to me is that he preferred his own people: poor Jewish peasants in tiny villages and hamlets, devout but illiterate, living unpleasant lives and desperate for good news. In many passages of the New Testament, he shows considerable scorn for Hellenized Jews, who sometimes seemed to be more comfortable around Romans than other Jews. He also specifically forbade his disciples from preaching to Gentiles (i.e., pagans). This limited the potential audience, and informed the future actions of the disciples. His only recorded trip into a city was the beginning of the end for Jesus. At Passover, he went to Jerusalem, probably for the first time. The authorities knew that Passover, when the Jewish diaspora returned to the Holy City, swelling its population from a couple hundred thousand to over a million, was a powder keg. Insurrection had popped up on Pasover before, and the Romans and their Palestinian Jewish lackeys (i.e., the Temple priests, judges, and scribes) were on high alert. Jesus caused a disturbance in the Temple, which caught the attention of the powers that be, and he was arrested that night and killed the next morning. His disciples seem to have remained in Jerusalem after this, rarely if ever leaving the city or the surrounding area, except perhaps to go to their hometowns every now and then. They didn't have much luck trying to convert the Jews of Jerusalem, so it was up to others to spread the word about Jesus. Jesus probably died around the year 35 CE. Paul was writing his letters, epistles, and homilies only 20 years later. Unfortunately, he never actually met Jesus, and his letters tell us almost nothing about the living Jesus, whom Paul describes almost dismissively as "Jesus-in-the-flesh". If you go through all of the letters known or widely believed to be written by Paul, and write down everything he says about Jesus' life, you will be shocked to find that all the relevant passages will fit on a single index card. Still, there are few people as important to the rise of Christianity as Paul. He was apparently quite charismatic, and people paid attention to him. He had previously been a Pharisee, or a devout, zealous, almost militant Jew, and had been an active participant (and according to his own testimony, a leader) in the persecution of Jesus followers in Jerusalem after Jesus' death. After his famous conversion experience on the road to Damascus, he did a complete about face. Rather bizarrely, he now preached of the redundancy of Judaism, and urged his flock not to become Jews in order to follow Jesus. This didn't go over well with the disciples, who were well aware that Jesus was an extremely Jewish man, and had preached almost exclusively to Jews. Paul came into conflict with the disciples many times, and he wrote surprisingly hostile things about them in his letters. But despite the fact that he almost certainly turned Christianity into something totally different from what Jesus had in mind, he set the stage for its later success. Paul was on especially bad terms with the new leader of the disciples, James, the Brother of Jesus. The primary cause of friction between the two men was Paul's utter disregard for what Jesus had said and done while he was alive. Paul writes in one of his letters that he learned nothing about Jesus from anyone who knew him, and all his knowledge of Jesus came from his conversion event on the road to Damascus. He was openly hostile towards James, and to the other disciples, and insisted on preaching his own version of Jesus' message, which he basically made up himself. Because the disciples were hounding his every move, and because they focused on trying to convert Jews, Paul decided to focus exclusively on Gentiles (pagans). He began to say blasphemous things about Judaism, which only served to further enrage the disciples, who repeatedly summoned Paul to Jerusalem to answer for himself. In the early Christian texts known as the "Pseudo-Clementines", there is a story about the last confrontation between Paul and James. Paul is forced to humble himself and repent for his blasphemous words. He agrees to take a ritual purification bath, but afterwards, James chastises him. Paul's loses his temper and physically assaults James. He throws Jesus' brother down the temple stairs, and a mob sees this and swarms Paul (people in Jerusalem appear to have admired James for his dedication to charity and poverty, although they may have thought him a little weird). This story is probably an invention, but it serves the purpose of demonstrating how hostile the relationship between Paul and the men who actually knew Jesus had become. We do know that Paul really was called to Jerusalem on a number of occasions to be disciplined for his preaching. Paul would go to a new town, set up a shop (he is believed to have been a leatherworker of some sort), and talk to his customers as he worked. After a few weeks, he would leave for the next town, but he would also check in with the churches he had already created, usually by writing a letter, but if he heard something that worried him, he would send a trusted assistant to set things straight. If that didn't work, he would go back himself and read his congregation the riot act. Eventually, his constant clashes with the disciples, and their attempts to go behind his back to dissuade the Pauline churches of Paul's bizarre form of Jesus following, led Paul to go somewhere far enough away from Jerusalem that the disciples would not be able to interfere with his self proclaimed mission. He went to Rome, and after that we hear nothing about him, except that he was apparently crucified some years after he arrived. But his letters lived on, as did his influence on the Christian faith. Because of his problems with the disciples, Paul kept moving further and further away from Jerusalem. He seems to have preferred small cities and large towns, and his primary audiences were mostly pagans with the occasional Hellenized Jew. The disciples weren't going to let him off that easy, and after he left a town, they would send their own emissaries to contradict Paul's erroneous teachings and set the record straight. After Paul wrote the earliest letter which is still extant today, it was another 15 to 20 years before anyone wrote anything about Jesus. Fortunately, this time someone wrote his life story. The first gospel to be written was the one we know as The Gospel According to Mark2, which most scholars date to 65-70 CE. Matthew and Luke were probably written between 85-95 CE. In fact, Matthew and Luke may have been writing at the same time as one another, and it is clear that both had access to the Gospel of Mark, but Matthew and Luke didn't know each other and neither had seen the other's gospel before writing his own. John was written much later; scholars usually date it to between 90-110 CE. Although none of these men ever met Jesus, and aside from Paul, they may not have met anyone who had met Jesus; John almost certainly didn't meet anyone who knew Jesus. What we do know, or at least strongly suspect, about the authors of the gospels, is this: Mark may have been Jewish, but he wasn't well learned or educated. He gets some basic facts about Judaism wrong. His writing style is somewhat simple, repetitive, and plain. Matthew was either a Jew or someone who was very familiar with Judaism, and his gospel is the most Jewish gospel. Luke is almost certainly not a Jew, and in his gospel we begin to see traces of anti-Semitism. John was definitely not a Jew, and the Jews are slandered and demonized throughout the text. Taken together, this seems to suggest (rather strongly) that by the time the first gospel was being written, Judaism and the Jesus Movement were already well on the way to becoming separate religions. By the time the last gospel was written, Christians were becoming actively hostile to Jews. This was probably because the proselytizes had finally realized that devout Jews just weren't interested in Jesus. I don't have the space to explain here why this was the case, but it had to do with the Jewish concept of the messiah. Jesus clearly didn't fit the description, and Jesus followers took the Jews disinterest as a sign of wickedness. This is when Jesus' anti-Roman sentiments were erased from the gospels. The proto-Christians realized that Roman pagans were now more receptive to Christianity than anyone else, and so they made Jesus friendly towards Rome. The scattered dots on the map began to spread more quickly now. Towns and cities with little or no Jewish population began to host churches. The Romans began to see the difference between Judaism and Christianity. Word spread. Then came Emperor Constantine. He converted to Christianity (probably as much from political self interest as from genuine devotion), and although he didn't make Christianity the official religion of the Empire, he did abolish several laws which had persecuted Christians, confiscated their property, and made life miserable for them. A later Emperor reinstated the laws, but they were abolished permanently soon afterward, and Christianity finally became the religion of the Roman Empire. Once the stigma attached to Christianity was removed by the conversion of Constantine, nothing stood in the way, and the religion spread like wildfire. The map now became a sea of Chritians. In the ensuing centuries, it would cross the seas and consume the Americas, large swaths of Africa, Australia, and parts of Eastern Asia. Just How Fast Did Christianity Grow? The sociologist Rodney Stark wrote a book called The Rise of Christianity: A Sociologist Reconsiders History, or How the Obscure, Marginal Jesus Movement Became the Dominant Religious Force in the Western World in a Few Centuries. He found that during the first three and a half centuries of its existence, Christianity grew at a steady rate of 40% per decade, or 3.42% per year3. This trend ran out of steam shortly after the death of Emperor Constantine, but only because there weren't enough people to continue the trend. Constantine became Emperor in the year 306 CE. His conversion began in 312 CE, and he died in 337 CE; during his reign, the population of the Empire was roughly 60 million people. According to Stark, in 300 CE, the Christian population of the Empire was about 6.3 million, or roughly 10.5% of the total population. By 350 CE, only 13 years after Constantine's death, there were nearly 34 million Christians in the Empire, accounting for 56.5% of the total population.
