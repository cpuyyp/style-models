The effectiveness of such shelters against pyroclastic flows have been wonderfully discussed by user889. However, I understand that those shelters were never intended to protect against pyroclastic flows, but from pyroclastic fall, a completely different threat, on which volcanic debris referred as pyroclasts and volcanic bombs fall on the ground after been ejected in a volcanic eruption. This does not happen in company of a high temperature and high speed cloud of volcanic ejecta, as it is the case for pyroclastic flows. That should be obvious from the fact that those shelters are open and don't provide isolation from the exterior (only protection against falling stuff), a clear sign that they were never intended to protect from pyroclastic flows. In fact, on that devastating 1902 eruption of Mount Pelée mentioned by user889, there were 30,000 casualties and only two survivors. The only one of them that was in the center of the city survived because he was in a poorly ventilated, dungeon-like jail cell, an experience that should serve as a guide of how a pyroclastic flow shelter should look, and that's nothing like the one in the picture. 

Let's imagine you are at at the monument "La Mitad del Mundo" right on the Equatorial line on Ecuador. And you shoot a projectile straight North to Raleigh, North Carolina, 3,960 km North of "La Mitad del Mundo". Let's say your canon shoots a frictionless projectile at speed of 1,000 km/h. Then the projectile had a Northwards speed of 1,000 km/h, and an Eastward speed of 1,666 km/h which is the speed the canon at Ecuador have in order to go around the earth center every 24 hours. Now, in 3.96 hours, the projectile would have reached the latitude of Raleigh, but in the same amount of time the eastward component of its speed took it 6,600 km to the East. However, the eastward velocity of Raleigh is only 1356 km/h That is because at latitude 35.7° the distance to the Earth rotation axis is only 5,179 km (in contrast with 6,378 km at the equator), therefore, the distance it have to travel around it every 24 hours is only 32,540 km (in contrast to 40,000) requiring a speed of just 1356 km/h. That means that, while the projectile wast traveling, Raleigh only moved 5,369 km eastwards, 1,231 km less than the projectile, with the consequence that the projectile ended up, 1,231 km to the East of Raleigh (The right as seen from "La Mitad del Mundo"), catastrophically missing the target, and falling in the Atlantic ocean somewhere north of Bermuda. This excess eastward velocity visualization of Coriolis, seemingly falls apart when considering a projectile shoot due East or West. But it would still be deflected to the right (in the northern hemisphere). An explanation in such case can be found in this answer, however that answer is not as clear as I would like, as it just ignores the vertical effect, also known as Eötvös effect, which is important to make sense of the deflection of a projectile traveling East/West. In short, the increased/decreased velocity of a projectile moving East/West, increase/decrease the centrifugal force, so it moves away/towards from Earth's axis of rotation. This means "moves up" at the equator, and move south/north and up (in different proportions) north of the equator. The rightwards deflection is considered part of the Coriolis effect, while the upwards deflection is the Eötvös effect. 

In this question, this process is also discussed. In regard of the Monsoon, it is not a direct consequence of this collision. But it is due to the fact that Eurasia is a big continent close to the equatorial Indian ocean. Now, as this collision helped to put together Eurasia and bring it closer to the equatorial Indian ocean in the area associated with the Monsoon, you can argue that played a significant role in creating the Monsoons as we know them. 

Therefore, to say that the elevation of something specific is changing because of sea level rise is not something easy to backup, as there are many other processes to take into account. Scientist make fairly complex models to figure out which areas will actually experience flooding due to sea level rise, and unfortunately, so far they have found that there are many highly populated areas that will face big challenges for that reason. 

Where each row is a year and each column is a month. So you can pick the column of the month of your interest and compute the trend from that. Does it makes sense? 

That looks more like RCP4.5-ish. But again, probably too soon to say. Also, it might be that even given more time, the path followed by the climate system would be like one RCP in some aspects and like other RCP in other aspect. For example, $CO_2$ emissions might follow roughly RCP8.4 but methane emission might follow RCP4.5. Or somewhere in between. Another approach would be to use use an actual climate model forced by RCP8.5 (not just the RCP), so you can compare mean surface temperature, but that would be tricky for many reasons and also model dependent. If anybody knows of published estimated total radiative forcing from 2012 onward, that would be nice to add and compare. It might make the answer a bit more clear but I think that in any case, it is too soon to give a definite answer. 

(Picture from Wikipedia commons, originally here) In terms of shape, iron meteorites (that are a small fraction of all existing meteorites), tend to have very irregular shapes. Therefore, to find one as "perfect" as the one in the movie is unlikely, but not imposible. A Google Images search for iron meteorite, would show you in a glimpse the vast diversity of shapes, been generally irregular. Now when it comes to size, they can be much larger than that. Some examples are the "El Chaco" meteorite found in Campo del Cielo, Argentina, weighting 37 ton. 

After every sunset, once the sun is gone, I always enjoy seen the belt of venus rising in the other side, followed by the Earth's shadow. This is a picture I took (you will find better ones online). The Pinkish-purple band on top is the Belt of Venus, and the blue band on the bottom is the Earth's shadow. 

Orographic control: A climatic change can affect differently neighbouring glaciers. If the wind, air moisture or temperature changes, the corresponding changes in precipitation or solar irradiation can vary on different areas of a mountain massif due to its topography, therefore affecting differently each glacier. A classic and illustrative example is the orographic precipitation illustrated by the figure below. It explains why the windward side of a mountain range could have bigger glaciers than the other. Now, in the case of an increase in -let's say- temperature and air moisture content (that usually come together), the associated increase in precipitation might benefit snow accumulation in one side more than the other, while the temperature will affect both more or less in the same way. Leading to leeward glaciers receding faster than windward ones. 

Ozone is considered a greenhouse gas, even though it absorbs shortwave (UV) radiation from the Sun, which does not fit with the definition for greenhouse gases, where they are supposed to: 

I've built DIY conductivity probes for subglacial measurements. Unfortunately my sensors remain under ~100m of ice so I haven't be able to recover them to check the calibration, but for the same reason, I've taken multiple measurements to reduce calibration drift, as I'm unable to re-calibrate them. So far, they have produced sensible data for 2+ years, but I haven't check the calibration. However I can share the results of my tests and research in order to produce a stable sensor. There are two main types of conductivity measurements: The first one is the potentiometric method. This is the most common one, and measures conductivity by creating an electric current between two or more electrodes embedded in the medium to measure. The second type is the inductive method, in which is a magnetic field what goes trough the medium, and you measure conductivity through variations in the induction effect that that magnetic field have in a coil. 

The original table in the source paper (which correspond to Chapter 1 in, EARTHQUAKE THERMODYNAMICS AND PHASE TRANSFORMATIONS IN THE EARTH'S INTERIOR) is this one: 

Such large planets will most likely cooldown slow enough to provide many billions of years of volcanic and tectonic activity. However, from Earth's oceans, we know that the most biologically productive areas are associated to landmasses, because they force upwelling and due to the nutrients that rivers and winds carry from them. So perhaps more than the original source of the nutrients, we should figure out how those nutrients will cycle to sustain life: In an ocean world, the productivity would be limited by the strength of the ocean vertical currents, that could bring nutrients from the bottom of the ocean to shallow waters were sunlight provides the planet's largest source of energy. At some point, ocean worlds were very good candidates to host life, but now it looks it might not be the case: Due to the quick dissolution of chemical gradients on an ocean. The leading theory for the origin of life is that of the "warm little pond", an environment that wouldn't exist in an ocean planet. 

The red lines (40 km apart) indicate roughly the currently ice covered longitudinal band. To the west of it, liquid precipitation dominates and there is no permanent ice cover. To the east, there is very little precipitation (dry pampas) and therefore no ice cover either. The tree line in the area is usually between 400 and 600 m of elevation, represented by the green lines in the graph above. The mean wind speed (from a 22 year average dataset) when the winds hit the land is between 7 and 8 m/s (25-29 km/h), as show by the shading and contours in this figure: 

So, that is hard enough for an object, let alone for a person. In such case there would a lot more parameters that come to play. Like the amount of insulation provided by clothing, surface and moisture content of the skin exposed to the wind, body heat production, etc. Apparent temperature That been said, there are some attempts to estimate the perceived temperature for people including humidity, wind and solar radiation. The best example is perhaps the Wet-bulb globe temperature ($\mathbf{WBGT}$), that consist on the weighted mean of the readings of three different types of thermometers: A normal one, a wet-bulb one (affected by wind and humidity) and a very uncommon black-globe thermometer (affected by solar radiation). The formula is: $\mathbf{WBGT} = 0.7 \, T_{wet-bulb} + 0.2 \, T_{black-globe} + 0.1 \, T_{air}$ However, this value is not often used because is very location specific (depend on clouds for example). Nevertheless, perhaps a good approach you can take is to use actual solar irradiation from weather models to compute the temperature that a wet-bulb and a black-globe thermometer would produce, something that I think would be easy to achieve, and then compute the $\mathbf{WBGT}$ with the above formula. Be aware that the $\mathbf{WBGT}$ value could be useful for people to know how cold/hot it will feel, but won't tell you anything about the actual temperature of different objects exposed to those conditions. 

(taken from physics.csbsju.edu) However, there is not such thing as an ecliptic path on the surface of the Earth. If you thought of it as the "Ground track" of a satellite but applied for the Sun, you have to consider that the rotation of the Earth would make that "ground track" of the Sun look very different than the one on the figure above. It would be a spiral going around the Earth ~365 times at latitudes between the tropics of Cancer and Capricorn (remember that the Sun takes a full year to go trough the ecliptic path). When the the Sun is at its Northernmost declination (the top point of the red curve above), which is ~23° all the points on Earth at latitude ~23° North (the tropic of Cancer) will receive the maximum possible solar irradiation at the solar noon of that day. Once the Sun moves down to declination 22°, it will be the turn of the points at 22° North and so on. The reason because the Equator is the line that receive more solar radiation is because it is the one that is in average closer to the Sun's ground track (in other words, is the place with the maximum mean solar elevation). An equivalent visualisation would be to take the mean of the ecliptic, and by looking at the above red line is quite straightforward to see that it would be a flat line on the celestial equator, that translates to the Earth's equator. Does that makes sense to you? 

In short: No. Unless multi-million timescales are considered. The reason we keep teaching Newtonian mechanics, is because it is a VERY accurate approximation of a more general theory (general relativity) within the regimes of speed and gravity acceleration found in everyday life. Therefore, all the relativistic corrections to Newtonian mechanics in the Earth system are negligible. Both, for the internal operations of the climate and for the evolution of its orbital parameters on timescales of hundreds of millennia or shorter. One effect, would be the minor role that apsidal precession have on the change of distribution of incoming solar energy described by the Milankovic cycles. But that can arguably considered negligible. But perhaps the most important contribution would be the influence of relativistic corrections in Earth's orbit eccentricity variations on multi-million years timescales. State-of-the-art orbital solutions for the long-term motion of the Earth like La2010, do use relativistic correction, however they are rather small. The way the corrections are included in the model are described by Saha & Tremaine (1994), where they point that: 

The picture above shows an example of an electric signal that can be generated using a false ground and the PWM output of an Arduino board. The setup could be as follows: 

(Image taken from planetaryvisions.com) And the summers would be more mellow than what you are used to. Mean global temperatures would be much lower but at tropical latitudes there would still be warm weather. That means that the temperature gradient between the equator and the poles would be larger, leading to quicker climatic transitions as you travel North or South, and also leading to stronger winds and probably more powerful storms. Also the sea level would be about 120 meters lower than today, exposing many areas that are now underwater, some of them massive, like the Sunda land bridge (see map in the Indonesia area), many islands would be connected to the continents, like Tasmania to Australia and Sirilanka to India. England would be connected to Europe and the Persian gulf would be dry, as well as the Yellow sea. New Zealand would be just one big island, and hundreds of islands that are now underwater would poke the oceans. Using ETOPO1 I've put together a fairly high resolution image of the world showing all the land that would be exposed if the sea level today drops 120m (as it did on the last ice age). You can see it here. Furthermore, the Pacific and the Atlantic would be completely isolated from each other for navigation proposes, as the Magellan strait and Drake passage would be blocked by ice and the Panama canal would be a nearly impossible feat, with the sea level ~120 m lower than today. So probably, train transport would be much more important to carry goods across the Americas. The Suez cannal would not exist either, and navigation around the Good hope cape at the southern tip of Africa would be constantly threatened and perhaps blocked by icebers, so most transport between the Indian and Atlantic ocean would be by land too. The sea ice would be in contact with the tropical gyros, meaning that massive floating ice islands would be seen even at the ecuador, and icebergs would be all around the oceans. All that would mean that all the empires that rose from naval power (England, Portugal, Spain) would might not existed, then, maybe Asian powers would rule the world undisputed, and the colonization/invasion of many territories would have never happen or at least would have been delayed, leading to a completely different world distribution and organization. Another interesting change, would be the scarcity of shallow seas compared to today. The drop in total surface area for a given elevation below current sea level becomes stepper once the sea level drops more than 60 m. Therefore, the sea depth would increase quicker as you go seaward from an "ice age seashore". This would lead also to a drop in coastal water productivity (oposite to what is believed to have happened in the Cretaceous, with high sea level and abundant shallow seas). Also the day would be about one and a half minutes longer, meaning that the year would have only 364 days. The change in day length would lead to calendar changes. Currently, a year have 365.2422 days, that is approximated in our calendar to 365.2425, with the fraction part divided as 0.2425 = 0.25-0.01+0.0025 

Your confusion arise from the definition of East and West hemispheres. That's an arbitrary and confusing definition. Because East and West are relative directions. Meaning they depend on the position were they are specified. East and West come from the proto-germanic languages, where East means dawn and West means evening. Therefore, East from any given point is roughly the direction at which the sunrise happen. And West is where the sunset happens. That's why the east/west hemispheres definition is confusing, because if you are in the middle of the pacific, the Western hemisphere is towards the East... confusing. So let's forget about East/West hemispheres, and consider the East/West cardinal directions. Where East is 90° to the right of North and West 90° to the left of North. These directions keep the original spirit, on which East points roughly to the sunrise, and West to the sunset. Let's also forget about clockwise and counterclockwise, because that depends on where are you looking from. If you are on top of the North pole it will look like Earth is rotating counterclockwise, but from the top of the South pole it will be clockwise. Now, when we say that Earth rotates to the East, we mean that each point on the surface is moving to the East of that point. The following figure taken from pulauubinstories.com will help clarifying the point:
