If you would like to get/stay fit for skiing you should target these muscles. Based on personal experience, the following exercises prepare me the best for the skiing season and build the aforementioned muscles: 

It really depends on the individual. There is some research into these topic. You are right about the "competition factor". There were some studies proving that Another reason is how our brain reacts to the environment. Just like each room has a purpose (i.e. bedroom, kitchen, etc.) and our brain reacts differently (i.e. prepare for sleep, food). We show some certain physiological, psychological and sociological responses. You can read more here. Similarly in the fitness environment, our mind prepares us for the physical exercise. Also gyms are usually (always?) designed by interior designers, where light, colours and even round curves contribute to your workout/rest. 

I would like to lose some body fat and get stronger. I've always tried to stay active, but due to a bad diet (result of stress) I haven't managed to lose weight as much as I would like. But I think I have found a routine which would work for me (i.e. I would enjoy it): Joyful Routine Mon/Wed/Fri - early mornings - Strength Training (5x5 by Mark Rippetoe). No cardio. Mon/Wed - evenings - 2 hours active dance (similar to Zumba but more intense). Tue/Thu - evenings - 1.5 hours Muay Thai. Sunday - 2 hours volleyball. Very light. Me I'm 5'9" (175cm), 185lbs (84kg), 26 y.o. Reasonably active with some previous weightlifting, martial arts and Zumba experience. Also I cycle daily 16km (10 miles) to work 4 days per week (but I will probably give up cycling if I continue with my plan) Question I have checked similar questions on this site and google, and I know about sleeping requirements and I have created my diet plan. But given my specific workout plan and my health in general, would it be too much stress for the body? I am aware that due to my weight and intense routine I might need to take extra care with my joints, proper warm up and stretching. I would appreciate your views on this subject. 

If you would like to develop flexibility while continuing to burn body fat, I can highly recommend Hot (Bikram) yoga. I have tried gymnastics for adults and capoeira to develop flexibility, but the fastest results I have achieved were while doing Bikram yoga. (I've heard that due to the heat you can push your body to the limits, but it can be dangerous). I have also burnt a lot of fat while doing Bikram because you sweat continuously. 

I am a 21 years old male around 180 cm and 72 kg. I often do cardio exercise but I've never done any kind of strength related exercise. I want to start doing some and I was considering Freeletics as a starting point. What attracted me about it was the possibility of doing the exercises almost anywhere (because not much space is needed) and not needing any additional equipment. But I tried some of the workouts and, while I felt perfectly capable of doing some of them, there were others that I think that are too hard for me at this time. I don't know if it would be good for me if I keep doing those workouts that I'm capable of completing right know and trying those that I can't once in a while or if it would be better to do something else. So, would Freeletics make an impact on me as a begginer or should I seek something easier at first? EDIT: The main problem for completing the workouts is that some of them are too "long" for me and I don't have the required endurance to complete them (Dione would be a good example of this, 3 rounds, 75 jumping jacks, 25 burpees, 50 straight leg lever,75 jumping jacks, 50 situps, 25 burpees each one of them) and for individual exercises the problem usually is a lack of strenght (I can't do a proper pullup) 

I often have a very high heart rate when doing cardiovascular exercise even if I try to keep low intensity when doing it. I mostly run or swim and I would like to be able to keep a lower heart rate while doing exercise. Also, sometimes I feel a bit dizzy if I stop suddenly the exercise without decreasing the intensity bit by bit. Furthermore, my heart rate doesn't decrease very fast when I finish the exercise. It is decreasing slowly over time when I keep doing exercise in a regular basis but I would like to know if there are any tips to keep my heart rate lower when doing exercise and to get back to a normal heart rate afterwards 

I am a 21 years old male, around 1.80 cm and 72 kg. I study at college so I spend most of the day seated, I try to keep a good posture but if I spend a lot of time seated I end up having bad postures and my lower back aches from time to time. I specially feel this if I don't do any kind of physical exercise. I've been told that strengthening the muscles of my back would help me. I usually swim and it's quite effective but I will spend most of this month travelling and I won't have access to a swimming pool. I would like to do some kind of physical exercise to keep up during this month. I have tried doing some bodyweight exercises like Freeletics and I was looking for something like that. What kind of bodyweight exercises would you reccomend me to gain strenght in my back? 

Other than at my lower belly, I have not much visible fat in my body. Lets for an example, I limit myself to 1200 calories per day Do I have to burn > 1200 calories per day to reduce my belly fat? Is it practically possible to loose > 1200 calories per day for about a month or two, shouldn't that can affect my body? Also, I have started doing 

I started doing this for a week and I can see a little progress on my upper belly (seems like a part of six pack - which aren't very strange because I don't have much fat over there) I have seen people has transformed completely in 30-60 days program. What am I missing in my exercise or in my diet? Also, is it true that more muscle burns more calorie? Like a car with 1000 horse power engine burn more gas than 200 horse power engine.. Do I have to really hit the gym and to do intense workout? 

I have gained little mass on my chest and belly too (15-20% fat). Now I need an advice how do I train my body- by lifting heavy weights or light weights? Also, do I need to have supplements, protein shakes or organic multivitamin tablets? One last point, when last time I did gym for a month I noticed that I have lost fat from my face too. Is that fine or an indication of malnutrition ? 

I am now planning to go to the gym, I never did gym before more than a month.. and that was 5 years back. Now as since last 5 years I have ruined my body by eating junk foods, sitting in front of the computer (obvious, as I am a software Engineer), late night sleep and sometime eating one time in a day. My current build is: 

I know this may be hard to calculate but I would appreciate if you can guide me with the approximate calorie reduce (after burn) when a person do only 4 min Tabata routine 

from my knowledge, more muscle consume more calorie (just like car engine, more horse power more consumption of gas), so limiting calorie intake can cause damage to my muscle growth? Sorry for my bad English 

I have started doing cardio from one Youtube channel which is showing that in 84 min I can burn around 1000 calories (but 1000 is not my goal). I do gym also so I want to burn till 400-500 calories. While searching on youtube I found these tutorials for tabata Burn fat in 4 min 4 min jump around tabata by searching it on google I found that it burn around 15 calorie per minute (assuming that it has been performed with 100% effort) but some of the website users claim that they have burned around 200 calories, which is astonishing because he didn't mention after burn. So my questions are,
