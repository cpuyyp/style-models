Those seem to be taken from Huffman (1970) p.24 and following, which is available on Google Books: Cambodian vowel symbols Note that you must also take into account whether the initial consonant is first or second series. 

To expand on snailboat's comment above, you might want to consult Laurie Bauer’s ‘English Word Formation’ (Cambridge UP 1983) for some background here. Quote (p. 87): 

Is there a scholarly consensus about the status of Thai – is it stress-timed, syllable-timed, or something else? What should we tell our students, who are native speakers of Thai, in this regard? Could I try to measure this myself using Praat or some other easily accessible tool? How would I go about doing this? (I am not a linguist, and although I’ve downloaded Praat, I have never used it for anything serious.) 

From the question, one might figure that if this construction as to be used in a particular syntactic context, this would be inflection. Derivation would form lexical units for general purpose... 

This is usually still described as irregular inflection because of the stem allomorphy. Another classical distinction would be the difference between say ALLER again in French and BOIRE. BOIRE and ALLER both display stem allomorphy but in the case of BOIRE the differences in stems have evolved from the same phonological representation (allomorphy) whereas the stems in ALLER come from different lexical verbs with defectiveness reassembling to make a new one... 

During the course of their development, the word order of some languages change. Examples include Latin (SOV) that changed to SVO in the Romance languages, Proto-Austronesian (verb initial) that changed to SVO in most modern Austronesian languages, and the Insular Celtic languages, that developed VSO word order. How common is this phenomenon in the history of languages? 

The Icelandic language is often used as an example of a very conservative language, compared to other Indo-European languages, in general, and to other North-Germanic languages, in particular, all of which have changed a lot over the past few centuries. The retainment of its complex inflectional morphology since the Middle Ages is part of the evidence presented in support of its conservatism. It is often claimed that modern Icelandic speakers can even read the Icelandic Sagas (written about 800 years ago) with just a bit of extra effort. So, first of all, is Icelandic that conservative, as claimed? If so, what explains such phenomenon? 

If one focuses on morphosyntax (inflectional morphology), the differences might be hard to spot. On the other hand, morphological creation of new words (derivational morphology) seems to rely on some different principles. For example: 

A base is a lexeme used in a derivation usually for both the semantic and the phonological part of the construction. In girlfriend both the lexemes GIRL and FRIEND are used to build the derived word. 

By definition, compounds have more than one base: mice-killer is formed from MOUSE and KILL. Unlike Noun-Verb+er compounds, most of them are opaque and the relation between the two vary. There is a long tradition giving names to these different cases. For example, one of the oldest: 

Although not belonging to the Indo-European family, Finnish has personal pronouns that resemble (to a layperson, at least) the corresponding pronouns in Indo-European languages. For example, the consonant in the first person pronouns minä (singular) and me (plural) is also very common in first person pronouns in several Indo-European languages. Similarly for the second person sinä/se and for the third person hän/he. Interrogative pronouns kuka ("who") and kumpi ("which") also seem to share the consonant with Indo-European. What is the relationship (if any) between these pronouns? 

The Lusitanian language was almost certainly an Indo-European language, but whether or not it was a Celtic language is still uncertain. Some features, as the presence of the initial p- (as in porcom 'pig'), indicate that Lusitanian is more ancient than Proto-Celtic, which had already lost that initial p- by the time of the attested Lusitanian inscriptions. Other features suggest a strong parallel with the Celtic languages, such as the loss of the semivowel [w] > Ø before vowels (*owila > *ovila > *ofila > *ohila > oila 'sheep'), which can also be found in Old Irish (*wir- > *vir- > fir- > ind (f)ir '(the) man'). This uncertainty is of course due to the scarcity of data (just a few inscriptions, toponyms and deity names). What kind of evidence would be necessary to decide what is the exact place of Lusitanian in the Indo-European tree? 

*cf. Terry Crowley, An Introduction to Historical Linguistics (2nd ed. 1992), p. 153: “Languages are more likely to copy words from other languages in the area of cultural vocabulary, rather than core vocabulary. Core vocabulary is basically vocabulary that we can expect to find in all human languages.” Five basic color words (red, green, yellow, black and white) were included on Swadesh’s 100-word list. **There is an additional consideration: color words may have other meanings besides that of color, as in Chinese 青 qīng, which can mean ‘young’ in addition to green or blue. In extreme cases like Hanunoo, these additional semantic dimensions can accrue and throw into question the existence of a color system as such. See the discussion of universalist vs. relativist approaches to color terminology in Chapter 7 of William Foley’s Anthropological Linguistics: An Introduction (1997). 

In English and other Germanic languages, noun compounds are formed simply by “appending” the nouns in a certain order. For example, phrases like this are very common: 

The type of airstream mechanism you describe (air flowing through the mouth and nose into the lungs rather than the other way around), is known as ingressive. It is denoted in IPA by a down arrow (↓) placed next to the consonant that has this feature. By your description of the sound, I suppose it could be considered a pulmonic ingressive voiceless alveolar fricative and its symbol in the IPA would be [s↓]. But I don't think there is any language in which that sound is used for linguistic purposes, as opposed to paralinguistic purposes, such as reacting to a story. According to the Wikipedia: 

You could have suppletion and a degree of regular inflection. For example, in French, the verb ALLER ('go') has suppletive stems but its inflectional marks are regular: 

The levels you refer to seem to be dimensions of language rather than levels. The different dimensions interfere almost all the time. The same string of words (syntax) pronounced with different intonations (phonetics/prosody) can have very different meanings (semantics). To cite some other dimensions: sociolinguistics, psycholinguistics, diachrony, neurolinguistics, language acquisition studies, ... See Linguistics (Wikipedia) for more 

The first statement is about the fact that a form exists but it bears no inflectional marks. The second statement says that some forms don't exist at all (e.g. there is no gerund for CAN).

His point being, of course, that these constructions were introduced into English by the indigenous Celtic speakers, who lived alongside the Anglo-Saxons for centuries. My first reaction to his criticism was: "Yes, he is right! How could linguists have not seen this obvious causal relation?" But, then, every science has to clearly define its scope. And, perhaps, it is not part of the field of Historical Linguistics to try to explain phenomena, but merely to describe them, based on direct evidence (which is not the case in the Celtic influence issue). So, is the job of a historical linguist to provide explanations as for why languages have developed this way or that? Or do they have to restrict themselves to describing only how languages develop over time? 

A typical alternation would be the un-/in- prefixes: un-common vs in-effective. They serve approximately the same purpose but combine with different bases. The distribution could be explained with various factors, hence the 'multifactorial' perspective. 

This seems like a standard prefix playing on the homophony with "high" and the acronym formations with internet/information. It modifies its base in a way similar to a diminutive, creating an hyponym with connotation. Here, probably, an approbative effect. To be a compound, it would need a definite base for i which seems quite elusive. 

Idioms are essential to derivational morphology. Existing words change meaning during their existence. The existence of words is so fundamental people argue about it all the time. Sentences usually don't have existence, no one complains about people making up new sentences. New coinage don't have to be transparent. They can be interpreted through their components and through the context. The sum of information as to reach a certain level to achieve comprehension.
