$M_{0,n+3}$ can be identified with the set $(z_1, z_2, \ldots, z_n) \in \mathbb{C}^n$ so that $z_i \neq 0$, $z_i \neq 1$ and $z_i \neq z_j$ for every $i \neq j$. In other words, it is the complement of $2n+\binom{n}{2}$ hyperplanes in $\mathbb{C}^n$. The cohomology of the complement of a hyperplane arrangement was computed by Orlik and Solomon; here is an expository paper which covers the full result in great detail. In summary, consider the complement in $\mathbb{C}^n$ of the hyperplanes given by linear equations $\lambda_1(z)=0$, $\lambda_2(z)=0$, ..., $\lambda_N(z)=0$. The cohomology ring is generated in $H^1$ by the forms $d \lambda_i/\lambda_i$; these are Hodge-Tate of type $(1,1)$, so $H^n$ is entirely of type $(n,n)$. There are explicit combinatorial formulas for the dimensions in terms of matroid theory. In your case, I get that $\dim H^n(M_{n+3}) = (n+1)!$. 

To add some more high level context, the analogous example works in $k[t]$-modules. (That is to say, extending $k[t]/t^2 \oplus k$ by itself to get $k[t]/t^3 \oplus k[t]/t^2 \oplus k$.) In general, for any partition $\lambda$, let $M(\lambda)$ be the $k[t]$ module $\bigoplus_i k[t]/t^{\lambda_i}$. Then $\mathrm{Ext}^1(M(\mu), M(\lambda))$ is stratified into locally closed pieces according to the isomorphism type of the extension, and the number of components where the extension is isomorphic to $M(\nu)$ is the Littlewood-Richardson number $c_{\lambda \mu}^{\nu}$. This example is $c_{(21) (21)}^{(321)}=2$. Since $Aut(M(\lambda))$ is always a connected group (it is a unipotent extension of $\prod GL(\lambda_i)$), it can't mix the components. You can start to get context for this from the first two chapters of Schiffmann's Lectures on Hall Alegbras. Unfortunately, Schiffmann always takes $k$ to be a finite field so that he can count points, which makes it harder to talk about positive dimensional subvarieties of $\mathrm{Ext}^1$. 

Suppose that $x$ and $y$ obey $xy-yx=h$, where $h$ is a central element. Set $X$ and $Y$ to be $e^x$ and $e^y$. For now, don't worry too much about what this exponentiation means. Then $XY=q YX$, where $q=e^h$. If we interpret $X$ and $Y$ as operators on functions then $(Xf)(x)=e^x f(x)$ and $(Yf)(x) = f(x+h)$. You can check that $XY$ does indeed equal $q YX$. So the $q$-commutation relation can be seen as an exponentiation of the standard Weyl relation. 

This is a footnote to Suvrit's answer: He reduces the problem to verifying the condition $$\frac{1}{e^u-1} \geq \frac{1}{e^{u/p}-1} + \frac{1}{e^{u/q}-1}$$ for $u>0$, $p+q=1$ and $p,q > 0$. Put $g(p) = \tfrac{1}{e^{u/p}-1}$ and extend continuously to $g(0)=0$. It is sufficient to show that $g$ is convex on $[0,1]$. We have $$\frac{d^2 g}{(dp)^2} = \frac{e^{u/p} u}{p^3 (e^{u/p}-1)^2} \left( \frac{u}{p} \frac{e^{u/p}+1}{e^{u/p}-1}-2 \right)$$ so we just need to show the quantity in parentheses is positive. Putting $v=u/p$, we need to show $\tfrac{v (e^v+1)}{e^v-1} \geq 2$. We can rewrite this as $\tfrac{v}{2} \geq \tfrac{e^{v/2}-e^{-v/2}}{e^{v/2}+e^{-v/2}}= \tanh \tfrac{v}{2}$. Since the derivative of $\tanh x$ is $\tfrac{1}{\cosh^2 x}<1$, we have $x \geq \tanh x$. $\square$ 

Let's first do a fake solution. A real solution would look like a $C^{\infty}$ smearing out of this one. We'll work in the degenerate case $r=1$, so we are only gluing along a circle, not an annulus. We'll take $\theta_1 = (1/2) \ \overline{z}\ dz$ and $\theta_2 = -(1/2) \ dz / (\overline{z} z^2)$. Notice that both $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$ restrict to $dz/z$ on the unit circle, but are constructed to extend smoothly to the appropriate discs. So $\overline{\partial} \theta_1 = (1/2) d \overline{z} d z$ and $\overline{\partial} \theta_2 = (1/2) dz d \overline{z} / (\overline{z}^2 z^2)$. Our $\omega$ is formed by gluing these two differential forms together. 

This map is piece-wise linear. As a piece-wise linear function, it is (once you get all the coordinates right) the tropicalization of the LU factorization map: The birational map which takes an $n \times n$ matrix and writes it as a product of a lower triangular and an upper triangular matrix. 

Pseudoline arrangements which cannot be realized using straight lines are called non-stretchable. See Section 5.3 of the Handbook of Discrete and Computational Geometry, or Chapter 7 of Ziegler's Lectures on Polytopes, for examples of nonstretchable arrangements. Peter Shor has shown that it is NP-Hard to determine whether a given pseudo-line arrangement is stretchable. 

This is the variety of $5 \times 5$ symmetric matrices of rank $\leq 2$. It is studied in Chapter 6.3 of Weyman's Cohomology of Vector Bundles and Syzygies. The defining equations are simply the $3 \times 3$ minors of the symmetric matrix. One should be able to extract the degree from Weyman's Theorem 6.3.1. I'm having trouble following Weyman's notation, but I'll give it a shot later if someone else doesn't get it first. 

The following is sections 3-4 of van der Put's The cohomology of Monsky and Washnitzer with all $p$-adic issues and analytic subtleties (necessary to make the argument correct, of course!) removed. Let $X$ be a smooth manifold of dimension $n$ and let $F: X \to X$ be a degree $q^n$ finite map. (You can just view $q$ as a real number, the $n$-th root of the degree; of course, I am calling it that because it is the order of the ground field in the Frobenius setting.) We want to compute $$\sum (-1)^j \mathrm{Tr}\ F^{\ast} H^j_c(X) \to H^j_c(X)$$ where $H^j_c$ is compactly supported cohomology. Using Poincare duality, we may instead compute $$q^n \sum (-1)^j \mathrm{Tr}\ (F^{\ast})^{-1} H^j(X) \to H^j(X).$$ In van der Put, this is given as the starting goal without motivation (equation 1.2). (This part is section 3.2.) Let $\psi : \Omega^j(X) \to \Omega^j(X)$ be push down along $F$: The value of $\psi(\omega)$ near a point $x \in X$ is the sum of $\omega$ over the $q$ preimages of $x$ (computed with multiplicity, if there is ramification. We observe: $\psi \circ d = d \circ \psi$ (because $d$ is linear) so $\psi$ passes to cohomology. We have $\psi(F^{\ast} \omega) = q^n \omega$ (pulling back and pushing forward adds up the same thing $\deg F = q^n$ times). So $q^{-n} \psi$ is a left inverse of $F^{\ast}$ on $H^{\ast}(X)$. As $\dim H^{\ast}(X)$ is finite, this just means that $\psi = q^n (F^{\ast})^{-1}$. (At the time van der Put was writing, Monsky-Washnitzer cohomology was not known to be finite dimensional, so he has a trick to get around this -- Theorem 3.2.(iv). Finiteness was proved by Berthelot and Mebkhout.) So we can rewrite the desired sum as $$ \sum (-1)^j \mathrm{Tr}\ \psi: H^j(X) \to H^j(X).$$ For future use, we note that $\psi(F^{\ast}(a) \omega)=a \psi(\omega)$ for $a \in \mathcal{O}$ and $\omega \in \Omega^j$. This is also clear: If $a(x)=\alpha$, then multiplying $\omega$ by $F^{\ast}(\omega)$ multiplies by $\alpha$ at each point in $F^{-1}(x)$, so the sum defining $\psi(F^{\ast} \omega)$ is multiplied by $\alpha$ at $x$. 

So in every case, as the topology of $\phi$ changes, we can change the signs in the matrix. $\square$ The analogous argument works with general graphs and Pfaffians, starting with the vertices all lying on a circle. 

Another perspective: Let $K$ be any number field and let $E$ be any elliptic curve over $K$ with $j$-invariant in $\mathcal{O}_K$. Then there is an extension $L$ of $K$ such that $E \times_K L$ extends to an elliptic curve over $\mathcal{O}_L$. Proof: By properness of the stack $\overline{M}_{1,1}$, there is some $L$ so that we get a stable genus one curve with one marked point over $\mathrm{Spec}\ \mathcal{O}_L$. We just need to rule out the possibility that some fibers are nodal. If the fiber over a prime $\pi$ of $\mathcal{O}_L$ is nodal, than a computation with Tate curves shows that $v_{\pi}(j)<0$, contradicting that $j \in \mathcal{O}_L$. $\square$ I think it is worth bringing this up, as well as the CM solutions above, because there are many more integral $j$-invariants than there are $j$-invariants with CM. 

The point of this answer is to explain that we are both right. First of all, I am used to distinguishing between two notions. For me, a "$(1,0)$-form" is a $\mathbb{C}$-valued $1$-form which locally looks like $\sum f_i(z) d z_i$, for some $C^{\infty}$ functions $f_i$. In a "holomorphic $1$-form" we also require the $f_i$ to be holomorphic functions. Apparently, not everyone makes this distinction. That's fine, but in this post I am going to use my language because it appears to be more precise. Let $X$ be a complex manifold. The sheaf of $(1,0)$-forms on $X$ is a sheaf of modules for the sheaf of $C^{\infty}$ functions. Similarly, the sheaf of holomorphic $1$-forms is a sheaf of modules for the sheaf of holmorphic functions. Using the appropriate version of the Serre-Swan theorem in each case; we get a complex vector bundle over $X$, in the $C^{\infty}$ and holomorphic categories respectively. Taking the forgetful functor from holomorphic vector bundles to smooth vector bundles, we get naturally isomorphic vector bundles in either case, and this bundle is the cotangent bundle $T^*(X)$. So, no matter how you think about it, the "bundle of holomorphic $1$-forms" is the cotangent bundle. That's what happens with $(1,0)$-forms. What happens with $(0,1)$-forms? In this case, I think it is best to generalize the $C^{\infty}$ approach above. That is to say, we consider the sheaf of all $1$-forms that locally look like $\sum f_i(z) d \overline{z}_i$, for some $C^{\infty}$ functions $f_i$. Again, Serre-Swan gives us a $C^{\infty}$ complex vector bundle which I'll call $A$. From this perspective, $A$ does not have an obvious holomorphic structure. However, I claim that $A$ is noncanonically isomorphic to the tangent bundle to $X$. Here is the isomorphism. Choose a positive definite Hermitian structure on tangent bundle of $X$. This is always possible by a partition of unity argument. (My convention is that Hermitian forms are linear in the second argument and conjugate linear in the first.) For any $(1,0)$-vector field $v$, the $1$-form $\langle \ , v \rangle$ is a $(0,1)$-form. The tangent bundle to $X$, of course, does have a natural holomorphic structure; the holomorphic sections are of the form $\sum f_i(z) \partial/\partial z_i$ where the $f_i$ are holomorphic. But this structure is very hidden in the presentation of $A$ as the bundle of $(0,1)$-forms, and that was the point that was confusing me. 

Write $$\sum_{n=1}^{N} \frac{1}{n^s} = \sum_{n=1}^{N} \left( \frac{1}{n^s} - \int_{x=n}^{n+1} \frac{dx}{x^s} \right) + \int_{x=1}^{N+1} \frac{dx}{x^s} \quad (*)$$ You want to know whether the limit of the left hand side of $(*)$ exists, as $N \to \infty$. Now, you can check that $$\left| \frac{1}{n^s} - \int_{x=n}^{n+1} \frac{dx}{x^s} \right| \leq \frac{|s|}{n^{\mathrm{Re}(s)+1}}.$$ So $$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \left( \frac{1}{n^s} - \int_{x=n}^{n+1} \frac{dx}{x^s} \right)$$ is absolutely convergent and the limit of the first term on the right hand side of $(*)$ exists. So the question reduces to whether or not $$\lim_{N \to \infty} \int_{x=1}^{N+1} \frac{dx}{x^s}$$ exists. We can compute the integral explicitly, and see that it does not. 

The answer to the question in the title is "no". Let $W=S_3$. Then the transpositions $\{ (12), (23) \}$ form a simple system and $\{ (12), (13) \}$ form another. The length of $(13)$ is $3$ in the first system and $1$ in the second. As to the question "is there any relation?": Well, they are equal mod $2$. Also, as Lee Mosher says, they are within a constant factor of each other; that fact is only interesting for infinite Coxeter groups. I suspect that there isn't any more to say, but it is always hard to be sure that there isn't some other relation between two things. 

Maybe this is too obvious to be interesting, but if we have bounds $\frac{1}{n!} \left| \frac{\partial^n}{(\partial x)^n} f(x,y) \right| < C_n$ on all of $(a,b) \times (c,d)$ such that $\sum C_n r^n$ converges for some $r>0$, then we get the conclusion. This is because the Taylor series with respect to $x$ then converges on circles of radius $r$ around any point of $(a,b)$. Write $U$ for the open subset of points in $\mathbb{C}$ which are within distance $r$ of some point of $(a,b)$. These Taylor series give an extension of $f$ to $U \times (c,d)$, holomorphic in the first variable. (They agree on overlaps, since they agree on the real interval where they overlap.) Moreover, $|f| \leq \sum C_n r^n$ everywhere on $U \times (c,d)$. We want to claim that $\int_c^d f(x,y) dy$ is holmorphic on $U$. By Morera's theorem, it is enough to check that $\int_{x \in \gamma} \int_{y=c}^d f(x,y) dy dx=0$ for any closed curve $\gamma \subset U$. By Fubini, we may switch the integral to $\int_{y=c}^d \int_{x \in \gamma} f(x,y) dx dy$, and the inner integral is zero since $f$ is holomorphic. (We may apply Fubini because we have a uniform bound for $f$ throughout $U \times (c,d)$.) 

Here's a proof; I don't know any references. I will show that, if $L_K=0$, then $\det A=0$. Since the $L_K$ are distinct irreducible polynomials, this shows that $\prod L_K$ divides $\det A$, and the two sides have the same degree. Suppose that $L_K=0$. Then the linear forms $\ell_{k_1}$, ..., $\ell_{k_{d+1}}$ have a common zero; call it $(z_0, z_1, \ldots, z_n)$. Every $I$ has nonempty intersection with $K$, since $|I|+|K|=(n-d)+(d+1) = n+1$. So every product $\ell_{i_1} \cdots \ell_{i_{n-d}}$ vanishes at $(z_0, z_1, \ldots, z_d)$. That means that the vector of monomials $(z^J)$ in in the left kernel of $A$, so $\det A=0$.
