So, for your Terrans-as-pirates scenario, just put the Terrans (or perhaps the inhabitants of the entire Terran Solar System) into a position in which they feel forced to adopt asymmetric warfare: using small numbers of FTL ships to do commerce raiding rather than attempting to face more powerful races' starfleets. What you need to sustain, in your story, would be the following circumstances: 

This is serious, consequential magic. But it's not physics; it even ends by withdrawing the physical reality that the entire terrifying scene purported to represent. Still, Bellairs leaves us no doubt about the serious peril and horror it represents. And there's this, from E.R. Eddison's [The Worm Ouroboros]: 

One more thing: it may not be necessary to postulate an entire world with a scant atmosphere. It might be reasonable to topographically separate the habitable zones with intervening areas of extremely high altitude. A flat land at very high altitude, perhaps, cut with miles-deep canyons, with people living along the bottoms? No feasible way of traversing the high areas except by airship? If you do that, though, you will have to be very careful about wind. Turbulence and wind shear are, in our atmosphere, exceptionally dangerous for airships. How that would play out in a much thinner atmosphere is hard to say, but it's probably something you'd need to work though. 

These are only examples of how a group of humans could find themselves tussling with dinosaurs in a believable struggle for survival/supremacy. 

So, adding up all of the above observations: the question is not how you could explain widespread revolt, sabotage, bad behavior; it's how you could explain such things not taking place in an isolated environment "heavily reliant on drones and other machines"; in which "only specialized jobs exist for people". 

Hard SF writer Hal Clement wrote a delightful book in 1953, Mission of Gravity, which introduced a very physically correct non-spheroidal world, Mesklin. Mesklin, a high-mass planet subject to extreme rotational stress, is shaped like a thin disk with a central bulge. From the Wikipedia article: 

Your question's title: "Is building giant ship-cities in a water world a good idea?" demands an answer that's sort of orthogonal to the actual question you elaborate, and to the answers you've gotten so far. This rogue answer: Creatively, it's a brilliant idea. In terms of storytelling potential you have amazing scope if you can get this right. 

Some good answers already on navigational methods, but there's one question - and it's a non-trivial question if you're being realistic - that you will need to answer: what kind of charts would your airships be using? And by "kind of chart", I'm referring to the cartographic projection used to turn a spherical planetary surface into a flat chart. This is important because there will be no preexisting charts of the new regions south of the mountains. Your protagonists will have to include at least one kick-ass mathematician and one kick-ass senior naviator (possibly the same person) who will need to be able to draw new blank charts with Lat-Long graticules on them, on which position fixes may be plotted. In our world, Mercator projections have been the preferred navigational chart: they create a rectilinear grid in which direction is always accurate. These are huge advantages (as I can personally attest, having navigated at sea for some years.) However, Mercator projections do not work in polar regions. If you are operating close to the pole, you will probably want to use a Polar Azimuthal Equidistant projection, which isn't bad for practical navigation - as long as you don't get too far south. In this kind of projection, meridians of Longitude are straight lines, and parallels of Latitude are circular arcs. So, what sort of map would your civilization have built? Too far south, and Polar Azimuthal projections get less useful; too far north, and Mercator projections cease to exist at all for practical purposes. More importantly, what traditions of navigation would your Northern civilization have? If the airships have been traversing the polar regions, they would have likely settled on polar azimuthal projections; if they have been keeping out of polar regions, they would have been able to develop a tradition of using the somewhat superior Mercator projection. Either way, it's going to affect the crew's priorities and their ability to determine where they are. This will presumably have a big effect on your story... 

This is a short excerpt from a description of classical Alchemical sorcery, rendered in Eddison's masterful Jacobean prose. Its impact, its significance, has nothing to do with physics. It's pure wordsmithing magic. So, to answer the question: Consider the possibility of a world in which reality, occasionally, perhaps not very predictably, responds to the same kinds of impulses and influences that art and poetry exert on human consciousness. Consider a world that bears that kind of wonder. 

This is a pretty interesting scenario. One thing you will want to consider is the question of political theory. As Vincent says, "The first priority is always to restore the dynasty." Well, yes, but why? Because if there's no alternate principle of political legitimacy, the lack of dynastic continuity is a very grim prospect indeed, for all concerned (except, I suppose, the opportunists who feel ready to profit from chaos - and even they often prove to have been overly optimistic about their chances.) We call it "political theory", but it's really the question of how to preserve any sort of ordered society. From there, we have the leisure to inquire further into what's the best kind of ordered society. Still, in the situation you describe, people will be desperate for that first assurance: desperate to believe that there's a reasonable future in this charismatic leader. How can she provide such assurances? She won't have the benefit of Enlightenment thinkers like Rosseau or Locke, let alone post-Enlightenment theorists of legitimacy like Marx; won't have the benefit of a proletariat that's been raised to think for itself. In short, she won't have any alternate narrative of hope and confidence to replace the promise of dynastic legitimacy. If you want her to be able to hold on to power in any reasonable way, you can do it in two ways, as far as I can see. You can portray her as providing a new dynasty of some sort (by declaring an heir in an acceptable fashion, if she has no heirs of the body). Or, you will need to provide an alternate political theory that can win the allegiance of a preponderance of the populace and the brokers of power. There are some interesting possibilities there: you mention the governing bodies of major cities, the guilds, and the wealthy/powerful merchant families. Historically, this has frequently been a likely kind of social matrix for generating challenges to the political domination of royalty. When the people who manage the money and the local governments encounter political philosophies that challenge the right of royalty/nobility to interfere in their business, they tend to like what they hear. :-) You would need to plausibly establish precedent, and provide the alternate political theory with some historical depth. Given that, you could have a very dramatic story on your hands.
