'Aint no animals that are immune to bullets. I'd imagine they would try and catch him in a musket volley. Even if he can survive a gunshot, or even a few gunshots, he'll go down if you put enough lead into him. They could get him with a cleverly placed barrel of gunpowder, too. Alternatively, does the old world have its own magic? They could send some witch hunters after him. The hard part would be compelling the shaman to stand his ground. If things are starting to look bad, it seems like he would have an easy time disengaging. 

Yes. Rather than use a hoop, you can use a second train. Every time they pass each other in orbit, they push off each other, creating a more elongated orbit. You wouldn't go straight from Earth to another system, though. You'd build up velocity around the earth to travel to the sun, then you would repeat the process using the sun's vastly superior gravity, as well as a convenient fusion reactor - allowing you to build up a much, much higher velocity. You aim both ships towards your target system, and they set out together. When they get to the target system, they use its sun to slow down again; orbiting around it and using each other to break. Then make the final trip to the destination planet when they are going slowly enough to be captured in orbit. And that's how you get across space without any propellant. Plz send my nobel prize in the mail. The length of the trains wouldn't matter - your maximum speed is governed by the escape velocities of the 4 orbiting bodies - Earth, Sol, target sun & target planet, although a longer one would need fewer orbits to accelerate without pasting the monkeys. There would also be a lot of planets that would be mathematically impossible to get to. 

What's Good is Good The question asks a lot, so first let me clarify my understanding of the question. The wizard wants to make a better society. But evolution works on individuals. Typically, "successful" individuals spread their traits by reproducing more than their competitors. But the question is about creating individuals who are most "comfortable" in a society, such that the society is "better." "Better" is not defined. Thomas More, Thoreau, Big Brother, and the Unabomber all have different ideas of "better." So, lots going on here. Killer Bunnies I know this is not what you are looking for, but at some point, the constituent make up of this society needs to change from what it is now, to include a significant number of these mutant individuals (let's call them "happy folk.") Either a controlling minority, or a plurality, a majority, or the entirety. In order to do this, the happy folk need to be better at reproducing themselves--whether it be Duggar-style family planning or good ol' fashioned human cloning--or, they need to be better at surviving some situation that reduces the current, non-happy population. Or both: happy folk can multiply like bunnies and also have a "negative" effect on the current population, like say, murdering them. This is not unheard of. I do not mean to offend, but some (not necessarily me) would say that the population of Israel is undergoing exactly such a change. An indigenous population is rapidly being replaced by another. What Was Good is Not Good So you see my problem with this question? By changing individuals to be happy in a society, you wind up changing the society. But I can imagine that somehow you reach an equilibrium where [almost] everyone is happy enough to no longer require further tweaking to fit into society. Although these "static societies" are often portrayed as being fundamentally flawed, that's usually because the protagonist is an outsider. For example, Logan's Run/Brave New World: people are pretty convinced that they're happy (at least so long as you are in society's good graces). Everyone is generally predisposed to accept or like their position in society, coupled with some reinforcing education and fostering. Everyone has fulfilling work and takes recreational drugs and is promiscuous. People have just enough problems to have just enough morals to basically not realize the bubble they're in. Is that what you want? Is that what anybody wants? Running In Place The factors listed in the original question are great. When navigating New York's "smellscape," one can easily see how nice it would be to control your own senses. (I think that's why people wear earbuds and dark sunglasses on the subway.) But every tweak raises potential society-ruining side-effects which might only lead to an "evolutionary war." (The classic example of evolutionary war is: prey develops poison, predator develops immunity. Prey develops stronger poison. That's how you get tiny frogs that can kill an elephant.) For example, let's say that the wizard wanted to make society more cohesive and compassionate and so he made individuals feel a closer sense of "brotherly love." Let's say happy folk identify other happy folk in the same way that animals recognize kin. Well, the obvious side effect can be that they become xenophobic. Or, the logical extreme can be that they become fascist (the thinking is that all happy folk express their true "happiness" by adopting normative behaviors, and that anyone who doesn't act happy is a traitor and a threat to society). Better How? So, to return to the spirit of your question: if you want to keep society the way it is now, but tweak some happy folk so that they can thrive in this society, you can make them not care about certain things (like eliminating ennui and existential quandries by making them pure lizard brain) or you can make them overcome their problems (like eliminating ennui by making them super-social and fun loving). But both solutions fundamentally change the society they are adopting to. 

Cocaine /end thread. They could do it ethically by bypassing the cartels entirely. Farm to glass table, if you will. The growers in S. America make more money and nobody gets killed. Asteroid Mining With a good telescope and a stolen/borrowed space suit, they could pop into space, grab a chunk of iridium and be home in time for lunch. They would make way more than 10 million. Tuna Fishing A fresh Tuna is worth thousands. These guys can deliver them still-wriggling. Without the stress of being caught, their tuna might taste the best, too. EMT's They could respond to medical emergencies instantaneously. Anyone who gets injured could be in the ER in the time it takes to forward a phone call. This would save an awful lot of lives. In health care, there's this thing called 'The Golden Hour', where, if they can get you in front of the doctor in less than an hour, your chances of survival are astronomically higher. Teleporters could get all their patients to the ER inside that golden hour, saving lots of lives and making boatloads of cash while they are at it. An ambulance ride costs around 10,000, and teleporting is better, so they could charge more. Ohh... you said secretly. That makes it harder... 

Well, I am worldbuilding for the sake of it. I am not sure how effective my techniques are but one thing I have done was to include things I am being indecisive about. For example, I wanted my humans to be enslaved by another species but I was unsure as to decide which one, so I included both and reflected the nature of the events through different myths, ruins, and vestigial customs; I also do that with indecisiveness about how certain conflicts started, making my uncertainty the peoples' uncertainty, every perspective having some truth and neither having the complete truth, sometimes using characters to create these perspectives. I also try to build history through religion, hiding the truth within diverging beliefs: one group believes the world was supposed to be one way, another group believes the world exists because of something, each interpreting reality and building societies within that framework, and those beliefs did not come from nowhere. They are right about something, they just do not know what it is. To buffer against magic limiting technology, I make my magic as potent as technology (village herbalists will know some things but an alchemist will know more), thereby keeping the mundane aspects — ecology, politics, resources — important. Magical monsters are a thing but they are more akin to wild animals than to the horde of the Dark Lord. There are no kingdoms/empires that are what they were for thousands of years. Many important people are dying from something other than old age, religious wars are a thing, and arranged marriages are not free of petty prejudices. Borders are shrinking and expanding, peoples migrating and cultures blending, along with some conflicts arising. And there relative periods of peace in other regions. 

BONUS QUESTION: This page $URL$ says a man lived on coconuts from 1902 (and Wiki says he adopted a monodiet around 1905 or 1906) until imprisonment during WWI in Sept 1914, at which time he weighed 86 pounds. So, a while. 

Retrovirus! A retro-virus inserts its DNA into the DNA of the host cell. Usually that is a regular somatic cell. However, it is theorized that retro-viruses can also insert their DNA into a gamete (sperm/egg) cell, and when that gamete creates an offspring, the virus' DNA is permanently incorporated into the somatic cells of the offspring. Then that offspring will create gametes with the virus' DNA and pass it on to the next generation! Let's say a retro-virus infects a single sperm. That lucky sperm joins an egg and contributes its half of the DNA+virus DNA to the new baby. That half could have genetic dominant traits that cause enough changes to mark the baby as a new species. Now multiply that out: For the population at large: you could have a highly contagious and infectious but harmless to the host retro-virus that attacks gametes both sperm and egg, thus making every baby diploid with the new DNA. (You might have to explain what effect the retro-virus has on such babies.) The new DNA should not be fatal, obviously, since you want the babies to be killed by the robots. How cruel you are! But you're storyline has to wait a while. "Species" is often defined by being un/able to produce viable offspring. You'd probably have to wait till these babies reached sexual maturity to find out that they cannot reproduce with non-infected but can reproduce with other infected. (Unless you have a way to determine fertility or reproductive compatibility strictly through blood or DNA or other tests. I mean obviously after you discover the incompatibility issue then you can just screen for the new DNA. I'm just talking about the initial realization that the infected constitute a new species.) 

I don't think you could ever bring enough cargo to support the colonists. At sub-light speeds, the only viable way to feed your passengers is a self-contained ecosystem. What cargo you do carry would be a small amount of emergency food, hard to make engine parts and backup seeds & embryos in case you have an ecological disaster mid-flight. 

Imagine the universe as Einstein's trampoline, with each universe being its own trampoline. Go to a point on your trampoline where it's just like the trampoline of your target destination - probably (but not always) a really long way from a gravity well, where both trampolines are almost flat. If there were two identical solar systems, you might be able to do it in a gravity well. Blast off a shitload of energy. Like, infinite heat levels of energy, where the rules of physics start to get really weird. You can punch a hole through your trampoline and their trampoline. You can even cauterizing the edges to keep it open. Now you can travel between universes. 

The larger the body of water, the more stable the ecosystem. For example, when you are designing a fish tank, the smaller ones are much harder to maintain, because their chemistry can get unbalanced very quickly. The larger the tank, the slower the changes, giving you more time to correct and balance your nitrate & ammonia cycles. If you think of a star ship as a giant fish tank for people, you might want to build a live support system an order of magnitude bigger than you think you really need, so that it could house the plants for your nitrate & ammonia cycles, all your fish for food and still be drinkable. It would also give you some wiggle room if your heating-cooling system has to go offline for some reason. It could store/absorb a lot of extra heat in a pinch. 

Get In Me Belly! In a nutshell: for humans, "civilization" really got going with the agricultural revolution, which led to permanent settlements, which led to division of labor, elite classes, then writing and accounting. And of course, trade and war and religion and all the things you find interesting when you're not constantly starving. You Scratch My Back... But none of that would have happened unless we had the need and the means of invention. In this case, the "need" was safety. We evolved as social creatures. This is because numbers provide comparative safety compared to going it alone. Usually, prey animals like to stick together. It spreads out the risk of being targeted. When in groups, certain cooperative behavior tends to emerge. For example, most foraging herds or flocks develop a system of watching out for predators (vigilance behavior) and a simple set of warning calls. You also have some kind of understood communication. You may have cooperative parenting and group defense tactics (like how bovines often circle the wagons). This has been a successful evolutionary behavioral model for dozens of millions of years. But you don't see any animal "civilizations." That's because you also require intelligence. Keep Bangin' Those Rocks The thing about evolution is, mutations happen. Most of them are bad. But every so often a mutant has a (small) advantage over others in his generation, and that mutant gets to pass on the mutant gene, leading to more mutants. Some say you can look at intelligence as just another evolutionary feature. A cerebral and behavioral mutation that turned out to be kinda handy for dealing with situations that would kill a dumber individual (or get you laid more than a dumber individual). The thing is, human intelligence comes at a huge cost: calories. Powering a human brain can be 20% of a day's calories. So if you're gonna sport a brain, it had better be worth it or you're just as dead as any other idiot. So why did intelligence work out for humans? Because we're risk takers. (Is one theory, anyway.) As the changing climate turned forest into tundra, we were forced out of the trees. So we had to deal with new environments, find new foods, escape from different predators. Intelligence was good for that. As we became omnivores we had to come up with hunting tactics because we were pretty weak compared to the other animals out there. What's My Motivation? Civilization = Numbers + Food + Intelligence. Hyperparasites sound gross and it's not helping that there are probably hundreds of them infesting a single host. Ick! But that host is also probably in a group of hundreds infesting some other poor sap. Can you say Hyperparasite Party! Social behavior can be beneficial in any situation where two heads are better than one. I already mentioned predation. But also, maybe it's difficult to find and latch onto a host, so at some point in their evolution the hyperparasites figured out how to work together somehow and they increased their success rate. What's the "agricultural revolution" equivalent for hyperparasites? I would say these hyperparasites would have to make the leap from finding hosts in the wild to cultivating them in controlled environments. (This would be like if humans had ranches where we grew elephants that we lived in.) But since these are hyperparasites, it's obvious how to cultivate host-parasites: you cultivate the host-parasites' hosts! (This would be like if humans grew a lot of peanuts because elephants like peanuts and then when an elephant comes to eat the peanuts we move into the elephant.) The Great Material Continuum So, strangely, a hyperparasite civilization could actually start with the cultivation of the food that feeds the host upon which the parasite-host feeds ('cos hosts need to eat too). (This would be like if humans made a lot of fertilizer to grow peanuts, to lure elephants, to live in.) It's a pure and simple vertically integrated production model. You gotta admit that would take some smarts. 

My first question, so I am hoping this satisfies the criteria for acceptable questions. I am trying to build an amphibianesque species and have a few questions regarding some plausibility and possibly classification. Firstly, I was wondering if structural colours would select for eyes that could capture faster movements (I am not sure of the technological terminology), my reasoning being their iridescence would make them more sensitive to swift changes. [can ignore this question if you wish] Secondly, I read something interesting about hot blood in Nick Lane's Life Ascending: The Ten Great Inventions of Evolution. On page 211, he cites Bennett and Ruben regarding the advantages of hot blood, and essentially it involves greater stamina, and thus greater ability to defend its territory, and greater success in courtship or mating; I am not the sure if the last is due to the effects hot blood would have on offspring, they requiring frequent feeding to sustain their temperatures, but if that is an advantage of hot blood, would it lead to greater parental care, or both acting on each other? And that is where I am having some trouble with classification. They would lay eggs, have moist skin, and be a mixture endothermic and ectothermic, leaning more towards the former. What would their biology and behaviour make them? Edit: This species is sapient and I am ultimately asking if this species' capacity for endothermy could provide a plausible foundation for parental care and the behaviour for sapience; in other words, is endothermy necessary to evolve sapience (I want to avoid suggesting yes solely because we did it), and if it would disqualify them as amphibians, which I now realize is broad. [I am now less concerned about classifying them as amphibians] Clarification on their temperature regulation: they are mesotherms. They can produce an internal temperature but would still have to mind their external temperatures, which could affect growth rates and other metabolic functions: too hot, slower metabolism, too cool, faster, if I am reasoning correctly. Their temperatures would also be dependent upon the biome, by extension the seasons. 

Don't Use (Astrological) Periods So, as others have said, calendars are typically based on solar cycle or lunar cycle. Once you've got a year, you can chop that up (you don't have to have 12 months) into finer and finer pieces. Even the second and minute were initially defined as fractions of the solar day. Key to this is that the year repeats when the sun reaches the same point in the sky. It's periodic. Why not have a culture that tells time purely linearly, not cyclically? For example, in Star Trek, you have different planets with different orbital cycles, so why would Vulcan agree to a time system based on Earth's rotation around the Sun? Just find something that ticks off consistently (like Earthicans currently use a certain number of Cesium 133 vibrations) and start counting those off. Don't Use Any Periods Or, you could be totally fugazi and not even use a consistent time marker. Like a fanatical culture that measures time by the heartbeats of the Emperor. The rightful Emperor wears a (pre-industrial) chest monitor that wirelessly updates the Central Time Net or something. And everyone lives by that because he's the gd dmn freaking Emperor. If the Emperor gets nervous or excited, literally time speeds up for that empire. Yeah it seems stupid to us, but we just don't know how deeply the Emperor loves us (yet). You could also get Game of Thronesey and not really have constant seasons. Like, what is up with Summer and Winter lasting different numbers of years? That could also explain why cultures on the same planet would invest vastly different systems. Who Even Cares? Of course, you could also have a culture that lives on "island time," which is to say, they don't really pay much attention to time at all. Like, time is measured by how many spliffs you've smoke that morning. (Sounds good to me.)
