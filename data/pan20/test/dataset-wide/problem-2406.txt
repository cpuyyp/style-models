So it might be that real good monks will not give in to your desire to make more merits not really conductive for the path but simply for this or that being and becoming. And this is the point, Upasaka thought already about this the last days intensively, why you hang around here and waste you precious Gems, yet even possible to dedicate it there where it might bear real benefical fruits. No more demanding from a certain sociaty there is no more dept to pay. Atma has to thing on Upasaka Lals story about his teacher. Others then most western or todays "teacher", who use the Sangha and the tripple Gems right from the beginning to accumulate depts and demerits, having learned on generosity, lived on it, then even lay down the robe and make bussiness in teaching Dhamma as a "tradition destroying" Layperson enjoying sensuality and even take alms as well, he was a lay teacher and seemingly with time his Dhamma eye really opened and then there is no other way if possible, to live the holly live, ordained and also his family followed. This is a great story and shows the way it works and worthy to follow this foodsteps, since the others, having been giving goodness and step by step making a livelihood out of that, what do they do aside of distroying their old goodness and damaging the possibility of many in doing so. Since Upasaka is actually well versed in Dhamma, but might only have lacked of straight forward advices, he might find enough food for thoughts and my person trusts that he do not only make the best choices for him and for the benefit of all his dears around him but also that he finds the way to real happiness with ease by him self. Where else can someone arive having followed good deeds and the words by the wise, ones merits receive one here or their like old lost good friends where ever one goes. Theis neither fear nor lack of anything for such a person. Let mt person now share the The Analogy of the Fire-Worshipper at the end, since Danā alone at least just increases the corpses, death and suffering in this world: 

Beware of those selling you identity and this or that consciousness like every trader does saying "you can" or "you are worthy" which you would buy, but to what would you seek refuge in in that way? For more about the pratice (veneration is the ptactice!) see: Respect and veneration - Respekt und Ehrbietung: Apacāyana It's worthy to note, that this practice is a common in every linieage still folling the Buddha and is not maintained by linieages total outside the lane, those who actualky follow the Nigantas "there is no self, i am nobody and nothing..." (Note: This is a gift of Dhamma and not meant for commercial use or any other use for wordily gain.) 

Feel inspired to share you ways and possessions. If inspired to even share an audio of your recitation, feel invited to do such here: Rejoice with others & sharing merits pattanumodāna & pattidāna. You can link it into here and no need to take uninvited space or contracts anywhere. [Note: This question is a gift of Dhamma, and not meant for commercial purposes or other wordily gains.] 

Not keeping precepts, following the nose (mood), incapable of doing merits, lying around like a pig, eating like a dog, stngy like a mouse, dwelling in equanimity like an ox, such is called manussa-tiracchano, a human body but a behavior like an animal. If the question was about how to recognize such, this would be the answer. Behaving like an animal leads to rebirth as such. What leads to and rebirth as animal according the canon: 

Where in the western world are such as a real Sangha established and traditional and benefical Vesak-Pūjās undertaken by the Ven. Monks where people, young and old, rich or poor, could part-take also in their own county on 10. of May, today? Where in traditional countries are - usually much by serious "western" people from abroad frequented - traditional and benefical Vesak-Pūjā taking place. 

Ayya Khema was a dealer of Dhamma. Althought she stole Dhamma, was not shy to found printhouses and commercial retreat centers, was one of the main misleader and introduced Business of monastic in Europe, following other Sri Lanka originated Monks ans BPS, its not good to do the same, and take and use what is not given. Some had found how ever into Dhamma in line with Dhamma and you might find here, Ayya Khema. It's neither legal not any wholesome or neuter deed to take or make, what is not given. And if associating with bad friend, who lead you and advice you to have no shame, you suffer a long time. (How can one not even stick to basics teach such as Vipassana...) You people are not aware of how less goodnessis left and of how less dhammadana accures in this world, used to steal and buy Dhamma. That's really foolish and crazy and great poorness is really already right. You can walk the way of demanding nd claiming this or that and do you "social", "communist" revolution of those out of any merits. But there you are and from there it goes more and more down, having upanissaya and maintaining it to bad friend.

Sorav, Interesed, serious and the Tripple Gems respecting readers, listening to the teachings, if done right, straightens ones Right view. Doing it wrong increases wrong view and primaly respect. Althought even foolish and respectless monks merely even force to make Dhamma simply food for consuming and throw it on the worlds market for short and poor livelihood, one should not follow their way and use the medicine right. Listen unattentive Dhamma while doing even unwholesome deeds manifest on and on latent disrespect an closes up the door to Dhamma. Some good advices in this regard are found in "Abidhamma in daily live" (dhammadesana), by Ven. Ashin Janakabhivamsa. It's not mindful and not conductive to just consume Dhamma, since it requires giving at fist place. To answer short on "What is the Buddhist perspective on passively altering your subconcious?" The "Buddhists" perspective here is trade for gain and the world, while this of the Buddha and his following discipeles is letting go and Nibbana. One way is that in the world, another to Nibbana. Knowing this clearly one is not a little after any gain. (Since detail discussion is not so welcome here, and the enviroment not so proper for Dhamma Desana, feel free to raise question, even audio here.)

Most of the mentioned thing give not only just rightous suspicion of minor to heavy offenses but actually are such. In short, a Noble One even of the first person, is not a "charismatic" greed forcing actor or entertainer for mainsteam audience not even tended an able to sit straigh an restrained. Atma would be surprised if he even teaches the Buddha Dhamma but would say not even much to investigate and spending time worth for such a self declared "Arahat". Nearly the same can be told when looking on the Mahamevnawa - industry like pages and Dhammakaya is there never very far. Beware and read and learn about the Tipitaka, the best avaliable teacher first. Dukkha is not a Junge book story and a nice santa claus warm up trade fairs topic. 

If really knowing, Cosmicmath, the teaching about the three kinds of sick people might give good advice. And, you have neither a need or duty to answer, so good to think about, "Why I am so desiring to answer" :-) What "trick" keeps me caught in this kind of livelihood (entertaining the mind for some amount of pleasure feelings to survive).

Upasaka Suminda Sirinath S. Dharmasena, May Atma be able to proper trust that Upasaka is well, healthy any heedfull? Especially Notes here give further crosslinks, aside of the Sutta it self: SN 46.054 and a linked in another question AN 04.125 Also Sankhitta Sutta: In Brief (Good Will, Mindfulness, & Concentration) might be of interest. And here maybe useful Bhant Nyanadassanas teaching: From mettā Jhāna to nibbāna and a Sutta and commentat that supports that: DN.09 and at least The Limits of the Unlimited Attitudes - The Brahmaviharas on the Path to Awakening by Bhante Thanissaro with many links and crossreferences. All collected in "Metta-Boom just fills Heaven and Hell" Here some of Ven.Mahāsi Sayadaw comments. In regard of Bhanthe Vimalasiri, best to ask Upasaka Micro, he is surely be found on any forum of other tapapals, charts or equal Buddhist communities and as disciple (till not so long mentioned as such) of Bhante, he always loved to share in this regard. (Note: This is a gift of Dhamma not meant for commercial purpose or use for other wordily gains.) 

... in letting her chose which kind she would like to be? Valued Upasaka, Upasika, Dear seekers for the way to Awakening and Readers, Atma (polite adressing of the own person toward householders, where Atma dwells) has started the transcribtion and translation of a very seldom teaching in modern and western world in regard of the Maha Manala Sutta by Ven. K. Gunaratana Thera, still not finished. Most stories are taken from the Jataka, some references already found. In redard of "To Look After Feed And Take Care Of The Wife And Children Is Most Blissful/highest protection" it contains a story that goes this: 

Upasaka Saptha Visuddhi, interested and the Tripple Gems respecting readers, first of all this not a good article and statistic, think that it's properly build up on registered trade in charity which is far away from what is real giving in accordiance to Dhamma. For example, everybody knows that Swiss people are the most stingy peolpe in Europe and Chinese-people are for the most the most greedy people, yet they also have ways to give, or better trade. If you "tank" is empty, than you might propably have already reached the Eightfold Path and it's good to focus now more on simply "Sila, Samadhi, Panna". Being already there, don't forget that you might have beome a person which is already a worthy field of merits and it's good to be not greedy and let now others prepare their way to follow. Having given all outwardly one is on the stage of becoming a real homeless. When ever taking what is not given, taking for sensual lust, again, one needs to give to keep one self-esteem on a level that allows further paths and fruits. Its not praiseworthy to encourage taking for the sake of giving and enjoyment with it. Yet, on the other side, if still after sensuallity, it's best to turn also generosity into virture by giving service, best for those who are worthy to receive it, since help, assistance and service, Veyyāvacca (not translated into english yet) falls already like veneration, under the Sila part of the eightfold path. Atma can only encourage again and again, support, help and dedicate what ever possible and insired to the Savaka Sangha, don't waste your goodness into throwing gold into the mud or clear water into the salty ocean. No money and material needs required at all and when even keeping 8 precepts, all time worthy of living on gifts of the country dedicated to the worthy Ones and trainees. But there is also another point, shown in a nice story of a giving greedy Deva, Upasaka might know and remember: 

Often it's good that the Ox sees the down so that he moves faster, if one still does not hurry, one is no match even for on ox, as Ajahn Chah once told. If having done merits, having arrived to all blessing (Upasika Nina van Gorkom, now over 90 already if still alive, once gave Atma one of here teachings on it, to be shared as gift of Dhamma further), what has one to fear? And no need to hurry any more. Look at all the youth, all those who are drunken in youth, health and live, yet they do not really fear, wasting this precious time that could be over even today. [Note: This is a gift of Dhamma, not meant for commercial purpose or other wordily gains] 

Upasaka Saptha Visuddhi, interested reader, My person does not give you the desied target here, but maybe support for the problem: Althought Jhana is a good alternative, still one can develope desire for it, so focus on Vipassana, here or there, or where ever one might be, removes the fetters actually. 

Touch, is the cause of suffering, if not-knowing is not touched, if one is not touched, how could suffering arise. Pleasure and pain are caused by touch, Nyom Saptha Visuddhi, and by no other, this, or that man. And who could solve the problem of still being touched if not one self by listening and putting into practic the path, for the sake of destroying not-knowingness? [Attention!: This touch of Dhamma is a gift and not meant to get touched with not-knowingness but its destruction, not for using it for commercial purposes or other wordily gains and to keep alive the flames of death and suffering. It has the only purpose to let one come in touch with Dhamma, and it is harmful if using not for the sake of liberation but for the world.] 

Valued Upasaka, Upasika, Dear seeker for way to awakening and readers, Vesak-Pūjā (Birth, Awakening and Paranibbana-Remembering day of the Buddha, (Vesak= Name of the secound month of the luna calender/pi: Visaka; Pūjā = sacrify, veneration.) It's the near end of an auspicious period in which most Nikayas cellerbrated Uposatha in timely union. A season in which seldom, even last oppotunities and possibilities that place. Only some view more days the bigges celebration, now undertaken nearly all over the world (!) - some say it's the fist time and actually so that it is cellebrated in the whole world - and the main and biggest Veneration of our times Buddha, takes place. 

Ven. members of the Sangha coming accross here, Valued Upāsaka, Upāsikā, Valued team here and for awakening searching readers, Just this moment my person came up this thought again and afterwards "Why not ask on Bu-SE": Obiviously is developing muditā (sympatic/appreciative joy) merely a unbeloved practice in modern wourld especially on internet. Does anybody not only know but even likes to share the merits of places dedicated to share merits (puñña) and also invites others and takes part on merits of others? If you think that you are already a Yogi and beyound of such, you may consider: 

What are the places you know, where "Transference of Merit"(Pattānuppadāna) and "Rejoicing in otherʼs Merit" (Abbhanumodana) are not poor cousins? Links as well, if inspired, some personal descriptions, maybe recalling some of others good deeds or own joy, are conductive. May the question and its answeres here be an answer by it self. Anumodana! (Note: Practicing here and now, while answering is very useful for one self and all other) 

(If somebody feels inspired to help prove reading and/or translating further, one should feel welcome to take this possibility. Topic as well as sources can be found here: Mangala Sutta Uannana - Ven. K. Gunaratana Thera(draft) (Note, this question and content is a gift of Dhamma and not meant for commerzial use or other purpose of wordily gains.) 

Mr/Mrs Larn, Why not? "Off (good) cause" there are reasons why not and on (good) course reasons why. It's rather foolish to say that an awakened would not share past merits if conuctive or would anybody saw the Buddha him self lived a paradox? Since an Arahat (especially) would not "claim" such for certain low puposes, not to speak of evil, he might not violate even a precept or rule (how could he?) For example a clear indication that such sharing of merits are not bad at first hand but has rather to do with generaly issa in certain communities believing equanimity is the highes virtue: 

No, they are neither Disciples of the Buddha nor do they care about the conducts of the Noble ones (Althought not having looked the movie), if socializing in such ways and touch even lay people. Touching a living being in aversion, beating, is a violation of the precepts. Touching a living being out of lust, for socialising purpose is a violation of the precepts. Touching the head of others is very respectless, it migh be out of this, that people show in this way there respect, a cultural costum. For Tibetans for example very usual, but again, it's not the costum of the Noble Ones and has nothing to do with Brahmacaria (holly life) And to do such as "Exorcism", if that was the case, that is not only simply betray but called "livelyhood like animals" and not allowed to do for laypeople generally like a "doctor".
