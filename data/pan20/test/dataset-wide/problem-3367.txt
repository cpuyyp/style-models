thesis is Ancient Greek for "setting (down), placing", and @user438 is completely correct that the connection is that someone "sets down" arguments and propositions. Other related indirect senses mentioned in the LSJ dictionary include "instituting games", "setting forth" in legal form, monetary deposits, a "general question" (as opposed to the hypothesis, lit. "under-placing", the "special case"), a "downbeat" in music, and a stop in punctuation. The earliest attestation of the philosophical sense given in LSJ, "thesis, position, assumed and requiring proof" is in Plato's Republic, 335a: $URL$ Notice how thesis "placing" is led up to in this excerpt by repeated use of the related verb tithēmi "to put; (mediopassive) to take up a position"—both in the same sense of "taking up an intellectual position": καὶ μάλα, ἔφη, οὕτω συμβαίνει. ἀλλὰ μεταθώμεθα: κινδυνεύομεν γὰρ οὐκ ὀρθῶς τὸν φίλον καὶ ἐχθρὸν θέσθαι. “Most certainly,” he said, “it does work out so. But let us change our ground ["change position"]; for it looks as if we were wrong in the notion we took up about ["in positioning"] the friend and the enemy.” πῶς θέμενοι, ὦ Πολέμαρχε; “What notion ["how did we position"], Polemarchus?” τὸν δοκοῦντα χρηστόν, τοῦτον φίλον εἶναι. “That the man who seems to us good is the friend.” νῦν δὲ πῶς, ἦν δ᾽ ἐγώ, μεταθώμεθα; “And to what shall we change it now ["change position"]?” said I. τὸν δοκοῦντά τε, ἦ δ᾽ ὅς, καὶ τὸν ὄντα χρηστὸν φίλον: καὶ περὶ τοῦ ἐχθροῦ δὲ ἡ αὐτὴ θέσις. “That the man who both seems and is good is the friend, but that he who seems but is not really so seems but is not really the friend. And there will be the same assumption ["position, thesis"] about the enemy.” 

Another instance, though a sketchy one. At least one description of Tsakonian (I think it's Scutt, C. A. 1912-13. The Tsakonian Dialect I. The Annual of the British School at Athens 19. 133-173) commented that men's pronunciation of palatalised /r/ resembled "the Czech r". The pronunciation would have been unstable even at the time (hence the sociolinguistic split of men vs women), and all subsequent descriptions say it is simply [ʒ]. Greek-based practical orthographies of Tsakonian continue to write the sound as ρζ—just like the <rz> digraph in Polish, which appears to reflect a similar development. So "justice of the peace", Stadnard Greek ειρηνοδίκης [irinoðicis], was rendered in Tsakonian as ρζινοδίτζη [r̝inoðitɕi]. 

The assumption I've seen in older accounts was that this was triggered by language contact with Caucasian languages. The paper I've linked to seems to prefer internal causes, and places Pontic on a continuum with Cappadocian Greek (historical spoken in Central Turkey), which has lost gender agreement altogether. 

I'm building on $URL$ @user6726's answer to the related question. The very earliest renderings of Zulu in Roman script, as @user6726 reports, used normal Roman capitalisation conventions. @user6726 reports that 

I have checked on Wordnet, and gasoline is indeed listed as a substance, while wine and milk are listed as food. Wordnet and other such ontologies impose taxonomies on the world, and the thing about taxonomies is, you can classify entities more than one way. If an artefact is understood as something that only exists in the world through human intervention, then you could argue that gasoline is an artefact. That argument probably does not hold for wine, which in fact originated without human intervention as accidentally fermented grape juice. That argument certainly does not apply to milk, which has existed as long as mammals have. The only human intervention applicable there is the industry around its commercial distribution, including pasteurisation. Yet even in the case of pasteurized milk, or gasoline, or refined sugar, the specific form may have originated through human intervention, but the underlying substance is still natural. In any case, the prototypical notion of an artefact is something assembled or built, as a tool in the broadest sense (broad enough to include buildings). The relationship of people to substances and food stuff, on the other hand, is the same whether those substances are refined by humans or used as found in nature. And these taxonomies, as ways of understanding the world, are essentially relational and anthropocentric: the fact that we eat something is a more important relation than whether someone else manufactured that something or not. 

παλαιότερα is not "more ancient use", but "older". And that's significant: it can refer to an older Demotic form which is now obsolete. In fact, it is far likelier to be Demotic than Katharevousa. Learnèd forms (λόγιος) are indeed forms that (re-)entered Greek via Katharevousa, but have been accepted into Standard Modern Greek. αρχαιοπρεπής (archaic) is more literally "ancient-looking"; it hints (although it doesn't assert) that the word has not been accepted into Standard Modern Greek. That said, the answer to "when does Katharevousa end and when do so-called learned words begin" is "the 1920s", when the generation of Demoticists after Psichari (Tzartzanos and Triantafyllidis) stopped fighting Katharevousa, and accepted that hybrid Katharevousa forms would enter into Demotic—as long as (most of) the morphology was Demotic. Kinda. But it's contentious. You're right that the nominative -εύς is unacceptable in Standard Modern Greek, and that genitive of old -εύς, -ις nouns is still an area of free variation, with both -ης and -έως used; the decision on which to use is tied up in register, but also in lexicon—commonplace nouns like κατάσταση will usually not use it. 

Motivated by Is the lowercase first letter of a proper noun common in the Swazi language? Zulu, and the other $URL$ as user@6726 reports in his answer there, capitalise the root of proper nouns, and leave their prefixes uncapitalised; this results in camel-case like isiZulu and uDavida. When and how was this convention introduced? 

It's a circular answer, but light verbs are particularly prominent as a strategy in borrowing verbs from other languages, and that is because verbs are a more closed class than nouns. We use light verbs out of a slight reluctance to use novel full verbs. 

See the discussion in Vox Graeca ($URL$ pirated versions are easy to find online). The basics can indeed be recovered from the Roman-era grammarians and the early usage of accents. (We know that grave was neutral pitch, because initially it was used on all unstressed syllables.) Some of the detail—notably the moraic account of pitch contours in $URL$ from linguistic theory. 

The 1859 grammar of Zulu by the American missionary Lewis Grout likewise still uses the older capitalisation: Udavida not uDavida for "David": On the other hand, Bishop John Colenso's grammar written in the same year uses the modern camel-case convention. And little hints I see in Wikipedia and Google show that inconsistency in Zulu capitalisation persisted for a while. What seems to be an explanation occurs in the 1868 book Nursery Tales, Traditions, & Histories of the Zulus by Henry Callaway, which uses the older capitalisation, and rejects camel-case: 

There's not a lot. The obvious place to start is Modern Greek :-) , and even there, there's just words corresponding to Latin nihil- words: 

Much simpler reason. The teaching of Koine Greek is dependent on the local tradition for the teaching of Classical Greek: Classical Greek is more prestigious in language teaching, and is how most language teachers and linguists have been exposed to pre-Modern Greek. There was not a strong impetus for a separate tradition of pronouncing Koine in teaching to evolve: whatever the local convention was for pronouncing Classical Greek was simply carried over to Koine. And that's not that absurd an outcome. It is practical—the local convention for pronouncing Classical Greek is going to be well known and widely taught, and is (most of the time) stable. It also avoids drawing an unnecessary barrier between teaching of Classical Greek and teaching of Koine. As it turns out, Koine likely did sound much closer to Modern Greek than Classical Greek; but Koine was a system in flux (which is the point), and there was possibly register variation in the pronunciation of phonemes, precisely because it was in flux. That's a complication that's utterly useless for language teaching: do we need people to be pronouncing phis differently in Luke and in Mark? Do we have any certainty when phi switched pronunciation for a particular social group to begin with? A stable system like Teaching Erasmian is simply more practical, however ahistorical it may be. Unless you're jumping into a timeship, meticulous historical accuracy of phonetics is not actually the primary consideration in teaching dead languages. 

As @hippietrail mentioned, Wiktionary does: $URL$ So does the Triantafyllides Institute's dictionary, which is the only one of the three major contemporary dictionaries that's online: $URL$ 

I don't have any information on Latin/Early Romance (which would be a prime vector for such an expression to have diffused through Europe). And I hope someone else can answer for Latin! But I have stumbled across an early attestation of "Good day to you" in Greek—which seems to indicate that the expression was at the time regarded as novel. $URL$ The Life of St Auxentius (written in the early 6th century AD, in an episode preserved in two linguistically archaised versions from the 11th century) records the saint making fun of a villager for greeting him with "Good day to you": he retorts "and a Good [entire] season to you", and grumbles that the villager should have asked for a blessing instead. One of the two versions explicitly calls the expression "local", which implies "vernacular". By the 10th century, the expression was commonplace in Greek: it is reported in court ceremonies in the De Cerimoniis. I have found no earlier instance of a "Good Day" expression in Greek than the 6th century.
