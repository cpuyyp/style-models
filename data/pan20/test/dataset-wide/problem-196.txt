I think a major drawback to birds wearing armor, is that they most likely will not be able to armor their wings. Wings need to be in contact with the air to work properly, so wing armor would need to be at once skintight and offer projection. Metal is out of the question, as are almost all man-made materials. Maybe a thin film of kevlar could work, but that's about it. Birds are more than 50% wing by area(and the larger the bird, the higher the percentage), and probably most vulnerable at the wing. So individual bird-armor seems unrealistic. However, I don't think this entirely rules out armor, just individual bird armor. Several birds would be able to carry a large cloth capable of stopping most projectiles, providing tactical cover for other birds to shelter behind(the cloth can be extended upward with wire so it protects the birds carrying it). These cloths would be like mobile trenches, and battles might turn into encirclement contests between these mobile defenses. You could add slits to fire projectiles through. You could get creative, either way I think this is how bird armor is going to evolve. Some birds will carry the armor, while others will perform combat function. Individual armor just doesn't seem to make much sense. 

A lot of good answers based on time measurement, but I feel you're missing the point of what it would be like to be immortal. I think they would have given up bothering to measure time at all. This would make them seem very different to what we expect. After all, why do something right now when it makes no difference if you do it later. And if you're immortal, later could mean tomorrow, or it could mean in a thousand years. After all, what's the rush! 

As Philipp said - defence is more important than offence. So lessen it from the equation by giving fighters extra defence, allowing them to focus more of bypassing that then defending themselves. I'm thinking particularly of Dune where fighters had energy shields that worked better the more force was used - so bullets were completely ineffective and the only weapons that made sense were knives and similar. If you have to fight slowly, your technique is much more important than your lucky or quick strikes. You'll be encouraged to make flashy moves to disorient or distract your opponent from the relatively slow strike you'll finally make when you have the right opening, and can ignore anyone who just jumps at you. 

I think you have to add a sealed catheter to the guy, and a shit-tube, or else he will be living in his own excrement, which I don't imagine a person could long survive. He'll have to take vitamin d, because vitamin d is produced through the skin. Without the skin, I imagine he'll be a lot more prone to injury, since the skin cushions the insides somewhat. Molot raises a good point with keeping the blood fresh, but I see a couple of ways this could be done. Either the doctor produces it with stem cells/living bone marrow sample from the patient(a little sci-fi, but not too far off), or the tube is molded to the patient himself, and is just slightly larger than him, so not a huge amount of extra blood. As for CO2, It will bubble out(if the blood is exposed to the air at least occasionally. In fact, if you gave the blood enough surface area, you could let diffusion do all the work of providing oxygen, so he can't kill himself by taking off the mask. 

in a way we already so this - only with "slave labour" (ie very low-paid wages to immigrants or foreign workers). So I can buy a t-shirt today for Â£1 because someone far away got paid 1p for making it. So what would a society look like - well, it'd look a lot like where we are already. Now there is an issue with robots taking the jobs that these people would otherwise have been paid for, but this assumes that the robots are cheaper than the cheap workers - in the UK there's been a lot of talk about immigrant farm workers, its become clear that there are crop picking machinery available that could do the job these migrants do, but as the machines are expensive, and the immigrants are cheap... the farmers do not buy the machines. Same argument works for robots. Similarly, look at what we do with current workers, we provide more and more welfare in the form of part-time job top-ups. In the UK there is very high employment, but an increasing amount of it is provided for from part-time workers obtaining in-work benefits. I'm not sure how sustainable it would be if robots took over even more work though. the end result of robots taking all work is that the economy would have to be rebalanced with the economic output of the robots being taxed to provide support for the population. Universal Basic Income anyone? 

The planet could be a giant prairie. Grass can grow, but not much else. Hence why humans have to eat grazing animals, instead of plants directly. Similarly, if humans rip up the prairie and plant crops, you get a dustbowl that grows out of proportion and destroys a everything. Or, whenever humans settle down in one place, endemic disease eventually destroys the population and forces a return to hunter-gathering. Edit: If you downvoted, why don't you take a trip down to your nearest grassland, and try and eke out a living by eating seeds, and then come back and tell me how easy it is. 

No, not with current technology. Modern skyscrapers are limited by logistical factors, such as concrete drying on the way up to the top of the building. In terms of structural stability, we could build buildings 2 miles high. But raising this to 4 miles doesn't make a difference, many other factors prevent us from reaching this height first. Edit: yes, you could build the skyscrapers with less material, and you could make them skinnier. Elevators would use less power. It would definitely make things easier, but you can't just assume that everything doubles. 

We'd probably sleep like we do more and more nowadays - taking a nap throughout the day as and when we feel sleepy. This is quite normal now, its called polyphasic sleep and many animals sleep in this way, 'napping' during the day and night. It also happens with humans too, several countries where it is generally very hot in the midday, have a siesta, where they sleep for a while. This biphasic sleep pattern is also normal - before electricity, TV and internet distractions we all used to sleep in 2 phases, often in the late evening and then after waking for a hour or so, again in the early hours. Notably mentioned by Pepys as "little sleeps". There are other, more unusual sleep patterns So I think all that would happen is that sleep patterns would change to be more spread out, more chunks of sleep spread out through the long day. 2 hours after lunchtime and again after tea in front of the TV (no change there then!) or irregular sleep patterns as and when the opportunity arises. 

That's an interesting question, since we have absolutely no idea what conditions are ideal for developing even carbon-based life. For instance, for carbon-based life, we would expect something like an atmosphere high in ammonia or other simple nitrogenous compounds(you need some 20-30 distinct proteins for DNA replication) to even have a shot in hell at producing life, yet there is no evidence for this kind of atmosphere existing on earth; based on our current knowledge, it is exceedingly improbable that on an earth-like planet(or any planet really), carbon-based life would arise by chance. Yet, it did. The bottom line is that nobody has any idea what chemistry is likely to produce life. But why try to use science to answer a question that it cannot answer? The origin of life in your universe could be a mystery in yours as much as it is in ours. Perhaps in your universe, the panspermia theory is correct, and life arose only once, somewhere incredibly far away. Perhaps your silicon-based life was created by carbon-based scientists, whose civilization was eventually destroyed without a trace. Perhaps your universe is a simulation in the mind of a deity. There are so many ways you can go with this. 

Centuries? With current tech it would take 30,000 years to get a probe to our nearest star, Proxima (as they say in the news today as there's a planet there - lucky!). However, as Proxima is a small star that spews out so much deadly radiation, you'd have to go to the next nearest, which I think is Tau Ceti, 4 times as far away and possibly still uninhabitable, even if it does turn out to have a planet in the right zone that has the right atmosphere, and no Ceti-dinosaurs (or whatever). So you're pretty much on to a loser right away, considering all of recorded human history is roughly 6,000 years old and you have to spend 5 times that just to get somewhere bad... you will either have to stay on board forever, or stay nearby in orbit. So a world-ship that can sustain a population has to have quite an extensive ecosystem (eg Earth itself is one), complete with enough materials to self-sustain for millenia. It doesn't have to be as big as the planet but it will have a maximum sustainable population, but I think you will underestimate how big it still needs to be to house only 500 people. If you have technology then you will also not only need to be able to maintain it, but also have to maintain a society capable of understanding how to maintain it - and note: a priesthood that knows the magic words to turn the big atmosphere machine on and off isn't going to cut it, you'll have to have proper engineering understanding that can also cope with changes in society that will inevitably occur over 5 times the length of human history! Or you could sit in orbit as a new independent "country" and trade with the planet below for whatever they need. This is far more practical until (or if!) someone develops a FTL drive. 

Assuming they don't land on the polar ice caps, in the middle of a desert, or during winter and an ice age, they can survive up to 430 million years ago, the approximate time period of the evolution of woody trees. So long as humans have wood to make spears, they can out-hunt any other predator in existence. Of course, I wouldn't say their survival is assured, but it seems likely. There are always animals to hunt, and there will be many, many more in a pre-human world. 

Upper Limit on the size of the head Technically humans have two brains: One in the head, another(smaller, much less powerful) in the stomach. The second brain basically regulates function of the digestive organs, or something. Maybe it can be thought of as an outpost of the first brain, a small outcropping of nerves that need to be "where the action is," i.e. a field operation. Now imagine that evolution decides humans need to get smarter, but the head is already big enough to cause childbirth difficulties(this is the case). The solution is that the second brain gets bigger, and is used for "multi-threaded computation." Here would be an example of Multi-threaded computation: Such tasks would comprise situations when the primary brain can give the secondary brain a simple problem and a time allotment, and the secondary brain can solve it all on its own, without using the incredible faculties of the primary brain. An example is counting, or arithmetic: It's very simple to do(theoretically at least), and it does not require very much real-time data transfer between the primary and secondary brains. Basically, the primary brain sends some simple information(what's the prime factorization of 23856293698273325739248573029876129384762983462138741241234612394872649876219834?), where the number of nerve impulses needed to send the problem is relatively small compared to the complexity of solving the problem, and then the secondary brain works on it, and works on it, and works on it, and then sends back: The answer is 2*3*5*7*11 etc. etc., which is also a relatively small number of nerve pulses relative to the complexity of the problem. Now, imagine that the secondary brain gets bigger and more powerful as the need arises until it's fair to call it an actual brain as opposed to just a nerve cluster in the stomach. Disclaimer -- When you assume human brains are basically just squishy computers, it will be much easier to think about them, and also a whole lot more incorrect. 

The simplest answer is : they don't. When the iron age arrives, the elves run off and hide in their forests, living in ever smaller and more remote areas. Then, eventually, after the humans have developed these tools and technologies, they rediscover the elves in much the same way as humans discovered Aboriginal and Amazonian tribes and, possibly after much bloodshed and general unpleasantness, come to terms with them. so elves in a modern world will be using and preferring traditional materials, but acquiring and slowing becoming used to using modern non-ferrous material from the humans, possibly in a conflict between elder elves who might think contact with the humans is a bad thing, and young ones who want the benefits of not living in a tree. 

Interesting one... I was going to suggest words based around social class, culture or other behaviour, things like "your mother was a hamster and your father smelled of elderberries" or "you sir, are a vegetarian!" but then I realised these are insults, not curse words. So what else would be used when trapping your tentacle in a door, words used here have to be short and sharp. Quick to exclaim "b****d" or "F*** this". AS octopii based lifeforms maybe they'd be more concerned with environment, "dryness!" could be the kind of exclamation, or "you really inked that one" for a huge mistake or failure, or if they change colour like some octopii "taupe!" for cases where an ancestor might have changed to a certain colour to avoid a predator.
