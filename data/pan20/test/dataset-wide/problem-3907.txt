I can't resist pointing out that while the EH-argument shows that a group object in the category of groups is an abelian group, this does not apply to a group object in the category of groupoids, which is equivalent instead to a crossed module, which represents a pointed, connected homotopy 2-type. Higher groupoids are in some sense ``more nonabelian'' than groups, and provide a route to some nonabelian calculations in higher homotopy theory. So circumstances in which the EH-argument fails (for example a group object in the category of semigroups) are maybe more interesting. 

I feel, pac√© Grothendieck, that the use of fundamental groupoid or $n$-groupoid for a strict structure in dimension $1$ and a weak structure in higher dimensions is confusing! But I seem to be out on a limb on this. In any case, the higher dimensional strict structures have advantages for calculating homotopical invariants, as shown in my papers with Higgins and with Loday. These higher homotopy groupoid structures are known to be well defined for certain structured spaces, in fact for filtered spaces, and for $n$-cubes of spaces. This relates them well to classical homotopical structures, i.e. to relative homotopy groups, and to $n$-ad homotopy groups, and yield new calculations and understanding of of these. I hope it will be useful to explain the route to this conclusion. Philip and I defined a strict fundamental double groupoid $\rho(Y,X,x)$ of a pair of pointed spaces in 1974, but Frank Adams' opposition delayed the publication till 1978. I had been looking for a homotopy double groupoid of a space since 1965, but could not do it. In 1974 Philip and I agreed: 

You should be interested in the discussion in Evans, G.~A. and Wensley, C.~D. {Complete involutive rewriting systems}. {J. Symbolic Comput.} \textbf{42}~(11-12) (2007) 1034--1051. on the notion of noncommutative involutive systems, which in the commutative case are a well known modification of the Grobner basis theory. Evans' thesis is available at math.RA/0602140. I can't help on the proposed applications. Ronnie Brown 

One question which has puzzled me is, just to take the $2$-type, how does one specify an element of $H^3(\pi_1,\pi_2)$? In 1972, Philip Higgins and I discussed with Saunders Mac Lane the possibility of a $2$-dimensional van Kampen theorem to calculate the homotopy $2$-type of a union, and he explained why he had decided this was impossible. Calculating $\pi_1$ is OK, by the van Kampen theorem. Then you have to calculate $\pi_2$, as a $\pi_1$-module; then the $k$-invariant! Absurd! Now the $2$-type is also described by a crossed module, by a theorem of Mac Lane and Whitehead. Philip and I proved in 1975, in a paper published in 1978, that under reasonable circumstances, the crossed module of a union is given by a pushout of crossed modules. That seems some kind of answer! Of course, there is still a problem of calculating $\pi_2$ from this pushout, and even more of calculating the $k$-invariant. But at least the topology has been translated into algebra; the theorem generalises strongly a theorem of Whitehead on free crossed modules, and has enabled specific, even computer, calculations of $2$-types. For more detail, see this 2011 EMS Tract vol 15. In effect, crossed modules are a useful algebraic model of homotopy $2$-types, and it is certainly useful to consider what one wants from an algebraic model. Thus Loday worried that his cat$^n$-group model (called by him $n$-cat groups in his 1982 paper) of homotopy $(n+1)$-types was "purely formal", so was very happy with our van Kampen theorem for $n$-cubes of spaces which enabled some new computations, for example of homotopy $3$-types of a suspension of a $K(G,1)$. More applications and related algebra were developed by Ellis and Steiner, in a 1987 JPAA paper. It also seems true that strict $n$-fold groupoids model weak homotopy $n$-types. How does one use this? and how is it related to Postnikov systems? To add a bit to a possible answer to the question on cohomology, Graham Ellis has a paper on the cohomology of crossed modules. Let the debate continue! 

You might like to look at the 1978 thesis of Nick Ashley on "Simplicial $T$-complexes and crossed complexes: a nonabelian version of a theorem of Dold and Kan." available from Esquisses Math. 1978 at $URL$ He considers a filtered Kan complex $K_* $ and a natural homotopy relation to give a Kan fibration $p: K_* \to \rho(K_* )$, where $\rho(K_*)$ is a simplicial $T$-complex, i.e. a strong form of Kan complex with unique "thin" fillers. Modifications of this should give you strict consructions of the kind you want. 

My advice (as a pure mathematician!) is that the best way to get going in research is to write mathematics, and rewrite it till you have got it clear to yourself. The composer Ravel once commented: "Do copy! If you have some originality, it will show itself. If not, do not worry!" In fact the originality may show itself at say the 5th rewrite, when the creaking wheels of the brain have been finally knocked into a little motion. I did an essay on set theory for a College prize, which helped in an exam question. As a PhD student, I most enjoyed working with a visiting researcher (Dick Swan) on notes of his lectures on sheaves. Much later, I stumbled on the area of groupoids by trying to write a new proof that the fundamental group of the circle was the integers, and writing and rewriting my proof made me see that the arguments should generalise to higher dimensions. Daniel Quillen was said to have written thousands of pages of notes as he tried to understand various areas, and put them in his own terms. The question of publication of what you have written is more problematic. 

First, a comment on `studying category theory for its own sake': this slur was very much setting up a straw man. Those accessing the category theory discussion list will know that the discussion there ranges very widely, and actually discusses issues in mathematics, in contrast to other email discussion lists I access. Second, I have found some elementary facts from category theory very useful; examples are `left adjoints preserve colmits, right adjoints preserve limits'. Many years ago, listening to Albrecht Dold on half exact functors made me realise how I could cut down considerably a proof from my thesis by using the basic idea of representable functor: this automatically led to the existence of a homotopy equivalence making a diagram commutative. Again, the theory of ends and coends does make life simpler in discussing geometric realisations. Third, I have fairly recently realised that the general framework of fibred and cofibred categories is specially useful for discussing pullbacks and pushouts for certain hierarchical structures with which I have dealt. A basic example here is the bifibration (Groupoids) $\to$ (Sets) given by the object functor. I wish I had a good application in my work of some of the deeper theorems! 

the inner automorphism crossed module $\chi: M \to Aut(M)$ for any group $M$; the inclusion $M \to P$ of a normal subgroup $M$ of $P$; the zero map $0: M \to P$ for any right $P$-module $M$; the induced map $\pi_1(F) \to \pi_1(E)$ for any pointed fibration $F \to E \to B$; 

You might like to see this result on $\pi_3(S^2)$ as a special case of a result on $\pi_3(S(K(G,1))$ for any group $G$, where $S$ is suspension. This exposition shows the involvement of a nonabelian tensor product $G \otimes G$ of a group $G$ and how to describe the Whitehead product $\pi_2 \times \pi_2 \to \pi_3$ for $S(K(G,1))$, and composition with the Hopf map, in these terms. 

A rather belated comment on these! I like the comparison between the circle $S^1$ as obtained from the unit interval $[0,1]$ by identifying $0$ and $1$ in the category of spaces, and the group of integers $\mathbb Z$ as obtained from the groupoid $\mathcal I$, which has objects $0$ and $1$ and exactly one arrow $\iota:0 \to 1$, by identifying $0$ and $1$ in the category of groupoids. I got hold of the idea in the 1960s from writing the first edition of this book that all of 1-dimensional homotopy theory was better expressed in terms of groupoids rather than groups This led to the question: are groupoids useful in higher homotopy theory? Is the 1-dimensional case a ``one-off''? or not? I liked the more exciting prospect, but it took 9 years to get with Philip Higgins in 1974 a good definition in dimension 2, namely the homotopy double groupoid of a pair of spaces, and a 2-dimensional van Kampen theorem. June 2, 2018 More background to this area is in the paper published this year: Modelling and Computing Homotopy Types:I One of the points made is that the usual base point approach seems to assume all interesting spaces are path connected; yet the circle is a counterexample since it is nicely represented as a union of non connected spaces. The algebra of groupoids nicely copes with the more general case; one main point of my 1967 paper on the groupoid version of the van Kampen theorem was to obtain by such a method the fundamental group of the circle! Note also that if the theorem is proved by verification of the universal property, then the proof for $\pi_1(X,C)$ is no more difficult than the proof for $\pi_1(X,c)$; the case of many sets is given in this paper. 

Another reference I would like to mention is Sharko, V.V. Functions on manifolds, Translations of Mathematical Monographs, Volume 131. American Mathematical Society, Providence, RI (1993). Algebraic and topological aspects, Translated from the Russian by V. V. Minachin. He really does use some aspects of the crossed complex related to the handlebody decomposition, rather than the CW-filtration. We have suggested this as a line of possible development in our book "Nonabelian algebraic topology: filtered spaces, crossed complexes, cubical homotopy groupoids" (EMS Tract 15, 2011) since we work there with filtered spaces, and you get such from a Morse function on a manifold. I feel there is more to do there, using for example the tensor product technology explained in our book. This tensor product does reflect the usual cell decomposition of the product $E^m \times E^n$, $m,n \geqslant 0$, where $E^m, E^n$ have cell decompositions with 3 cells. 

Hopf's formula gives a determination of $H_2(G)$ in terms of a presentation of the group $G$. Higher Hopf type formulae for $H_n(G)$ were given in terms of double and multiple presentations of $G$ in R. Brown and G.J. Ellis, ``Hopf formulae for the higher homology of a group'', Bull. London Math. Soc. 20 (1988) 124-128. There are now a number of papers in this area as is shown by the references in for exanple Everaert, Tomas; Gran, Marino; Van der Linden, Tim: Higher Hopf formulae for homology via Galois theory. Adv. Math. 217 (2008), no. 5, 2231‚Äì2267. Miller's result is retrieved in R. Brown and J.-L. Loday ``Van Kampen theorems for diagrams of spaces'', Topology 26 (1987) 311-334. A tensor product $G \otimes G$ is introduced so that the commutator map determines a morphism $\kappa: G \otimes G \to G$ whose image is the commutator subgroup. It is proved that Ker $\kappa$ is isomorphic to $\pi_3 S K(G,1)$. In fact the 3-type of $SK(G,1)$ is completely determined. Item 114 of the bibliography Tim mentions links to computer calculations of this tensor product. The nice point is that $\kappa:G \otimes G \to G$ has, like other tensor products in mathematics, a universal property, and this is not shared by the commutator sugroup of $G$! Ronnie Brown
