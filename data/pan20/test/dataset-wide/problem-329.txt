There must be something pretty special that exists only inside this asteroid. Select an asteroid of sufficient size to burrow into the middle, but not so large as to make mining exploration appealing. Build a mini-capsule inside that spins independently of the asteroid. There's your full gravity, independent of the asteroid's rotation. With a sufficiently large crust, any heat from the flubberconverter coils could be absorbed and diffused into the asteroid itself without raising ambient temperatures to externally interesting levels. Avoid localized heat build up by drilling a network of negative space from the inside and build a massive distributed heat-sink. If it's a big enough asteroid, inside the capsule/mini-ship he can create a self-balancing ecosystem for himself, given enough self-discipline not to overtax its boundaries. For example, he can live there comfortably without overeating his oxygen-producing crops, but a visitor would destroy the balance and doom the life-support within days. Or he can only pirate the galactic news feed for an hour a day without stealing power from his plant's lighting, etc. Maybe his imported sea-bass get very ill-tempered if he doesn't eat enough of them, which may be likely if he gets tired of writing his cookbook, '101 Ingenious Ways to Eat the Same Thing for the Rest of Your Life'. The major detection problems would be in going and coming, unless it was in a dangerous part of space (what isn't?) where it would be more conceivable for ships to drop off of long range scanners without notice. Even inconvenient portions of the galaxy will have occasional visitors. Perhaps he will turn on the lights, and never leave again - that has its own ramifications. As others have stated, the best camouflage is to look as natural and normal and boring as possible. There may be an opportunity here to line the inner portion of the asteroid with heavier metals to give the illusion of a solid mass to casual scans, much in the same way that lead is sometimes used to fake a "solid" gold bar. 

There is a decent article on Brittanica about the historical use of spears as a weapon, although it only focuses on European development. As a great man once said, "Shields are for hiding behind." Only slightly less famous is the commentary of edged weapons, "The pointy end goes into the other man." The point (pun intended) is, spears are designed for mass use to stick the other guys before they can stick you. The Roman pilum was designed to bend on impact, preventing the enemy from tossing it back (with the nice bonus it snared any shields it stuck into). Any modification of the haft of the spear to make it a more convenient single-handed weapon also reduce its effectiveness. It's just not a good design for single combat at melee range, unless you treat it as a pointy quarterstaff - in which case there's no way to effectively wield two of them, unless you have four hands and an ungodly amount of dexterity. Many swords, by contrast with spears, are designed for one-handed operation (greatswords excepted). Even with rapiers, which are designed for the gentleman duellist, the Florentine style or brace of rapiers (dual wielding two full-size swords, as illustrated by Agrippa) requires significant training to be more than a death trap for the wielder. Even in feudal Japan, it took until the 1600s for the advent of Miyamoto Musashi's quite radical Niten Ichi-ryÅ« school of swordsmanship that introduced the idea of dual wielding katanas effectively. Let's imagine for a moment you have two spears of moderate length, and you are an expert at using them together. You have all the pitfalls of Florentine, with none of the inbuilt safety mechanisms. If you parry with a single spear, there is no guard to stop a blade from sliding up and chopping off your fingers. If you catch your opponent's blade with both of them, you have no way to bind the blade with a single spear to return the second one to play. If your thrust is parried, there is no edge on the inside with which to cut. If you happen to fight someone with a shield, the best you can hope for is to stab their foot and so hope to manipulate an outcome that way. The spear by itself is not equipped for complex defense. Video games and movies are wont to make us believe the fantastic (which I am all in favor of), but there is scant evidence dual wielding spears would be a winning combination. It is precisely these limitations that caused other permutations and the abandonment of the spear in its purest form for general use. 

Self-sufficiency, the key to Anarchy The system you describe is a kind of Anarchy, and Anarchy comes with a lot of problems in an advanced society - that is why we see no successful Anarchies around. The main problem with Anarchy is that modern/advanced societies depend completely on: 

I realize that you specifically ask about a gun that uses the "explosion" of annihilated antimatter to propel the bullet so this reply might not be what you want. But, doing it that way is not a good way to take advantage of the antimatter. Antimatter battery and a electromagnetic mass-driver Instead of using the annihilation of antimatter as an explosion (as it will not cause hot gasses, rather high energy radiation) it might be better to consider an advanced antimatter fuel-cell. Antimatter is held in some kind of containment and minuscule amounts are freed to annihilate. The tiny discharge of radiation is used by the fuel cell to charge electric capacitors. The capacitors are then in turn used to charge electromagnetic coils which accelerate a magnetized bullet towards the target at high speed. Benefits over a normal chemical gun is that only the bullets need to be stored (making ammo take less space - meaning one can have more of it). Also there is no discharge of hot/poisonous gasses which might be problematic in some environments. The antimatter fuel cell might never need a replacement due to it's energy density. For a really endless gun - replace the mass-driver with a laser, or go half way and let the magnetic coils accelerate super-heated ionized gas. 

Warfare is more and more moving away from having one big army in one spot where a big bomb would be effective. Urban warfare, guerrilla tactics, hidden bases, jamming, stealth technology - those things seem to be the keywords for modern wars. Combined with cyber-attacks, espionage, propaganda, misinformation and other types of information warfare, 'diplomacy'/bullying and economic pressure. That's why we see more development towards autonomous weapons and surveillance than weapons of mass destruction today. Most likely, as globalization continues we will see a shift from "military" characteristics towards "police" characteristics in future warfare. At least unless we trigger a full out world war III, in which case we are all doomed anyways. 

Human genetic material when transplanted into an eggcell becomes a human. At least according to us - humans are sentient. Thus, if we start with human genomes, we just need to modify them enough that they are unable to breed with normal humans. There are multiple ways to do this but one way would be to split one or more of our chromosomes into several smaller chromosomes. This would make the modified lifeforms basically identical to humans, but when a sperm and an egg meet they would not be able to match their chromosomes correctly and there would be no viable offspring with normal humans. Over time (hundreds of thousands of years), or with exrtra induced mutations or additional deliberate changes, the new species would diverge from normal humans. All of this is probably doable with current gene-editing technologies together with current cloning technology, at least if neither ethics nor budget is a problem. 

A thing to recall is that the language contructs available often largely dictate the thought patterns available to a society (and partially the other way around). Thus, if these aliens are truly only concerned with the immediate do not provide them with constructs that detail time. Any time into the future may be "tomorrow", while any time before now may be "in memory". Further, it may be worth considering whether a codified grammar matters. In real life, few concerned themselves with grammar until laws came into place that had to be unambigiously interpreted. That may again not be a concern for these aliens. Finally, if there is truly a large hunting aspect to these creatues; consider that their language may not be fully vocal. Sign languages were often used to not give away one's position, while whistling languages are very practical for communicating over much longer distances than shouting (comfortably) could. 

As someone who medically lacks depth perception, I can assure you there's several ways your brain learns to automatically compensate: Scale of distant objects gets matched to the 'known' scale of such objects to roughly get the distance. 

It depends on how you define steam power Allow me to explain with the best example I have: Must nuclear reactors are extremely energy dense, but they ultimately use water-steam conversion to make practical use of the nuclear power in order to convert it to electrical power. In most cases there is a measure of steam recovery to close the cycle and either active or passive cooling of the steam to be able to re-use it. Is a nuclear powered cross-atlantic flight possible? Absolutely. So, in essence, that means a steam powered flight is. It just uses a far far less obvious fuel source. 

Depending on the type of post-apocalypse you're working with, an unexpectedly great need may stem from consumables that can no longer be produced due to the waning of industry. In a simple example that always comes up: Ammo. There is a limited and always dwindling supply of it. Therefore, its value will continuously go up with only minor bumps in the opposite direction as new caches are discovered. Turning it on its head, your reality could function in this way on a variation of the gold standard: Any small portable object that can no longer be produced but is never consumed, and exists in relatively large quantities. An example of such a currency is the bottlecaps in the Fallout universe, which are accepted for exactly the reasons above. 

TL;DR: Really, really big (exact numbers below) Seeing the wall "crossing" is hardly the issue. Seeing the outer wall bend even slightly toward the inner wall - looking as if the hallway gets narrower further on - and the point at which that visually happens moving ahead at the rate at which you are moving already breaks the illusion of a straight surface. That is not to say it cannot be done, but it is made much harder by the fact that you have TWO surfaces that need to appear to have the flat trait and appear parallel to each other. Apart from the above, this is what is known as a horizon problem. Imagine the logical alternative: instead of building your round corridor on a flat plane, you build it along the axis of the planet. Depending on the height of your corridor, even this will be noticeable after even a short while. It will likely have a much lower ceiling than for example a tunnel meant for cars, and the horizon problem is actually a structural concern for the longest of those already. 

Without a social order, with law-enforcement, taxes, leadership etc. there is no way to keep the division of labor and common infrastructure going. Thus the key to working Anarchy lies in abandoning both of those points and gaining self-sufficiency. Hunter-Gatherer society: One simple way of achieving that is to have a primitive society where every family or individual have their own hut, makes their own primitive tools and depends on no-one else. Slave owners: Another possibility is that these independent, non-governed individuals are actually not the entirety of society. Each person, or family, controls a large group of slaves/servants who provide them with all their needs. The slaves provide food, protection, maintains their homes and even provides skilled craftsmen like smiths and tailors. But how can we keep the benefits of an advanced society and still be self sufficient? Post-scarcity/Augmented individuals: For a modern/futuristic society to be self sustainable on an individual basis I think there is only one option. AI's, robots and other automatic systems allow each individual to gain what we currently gain from society. Robots can serve as protection and harvest raw materials and food. 3D-printers and replicators can create even advanced technological items. Structures are self-maintaining and contains their own energy source. If such a system of robotics would be in the hands of each individual or small group - then they would be self-sufficient. Such augmented people would avoid the drawbacks of anarchy. Taken the augmented individual solution one step further each individual have their own space-ship full of automated systems. Each ship is entirely self sustained, leaving its owner with no need for other people except companionship. 

If it can convert mass to energy this makes all other energy absorption abilities redundant. Lets say a spear weighing 3 kg is converted into energy according to: 

This translates to 5,800 people sustained by hunting and gathering. This population will be reached by the above growth in about 9 generations or about 225 years. At this point population growth will stagnate unless they start farming the land. If about 20% is farmable, they could increase the carrying capacity to about 23,000 people. This would be reached in just 3-4 generations or 100 years after begining to farm the land in full. If they also invent irrigation, they could both increase the yeilds and increase the farmable area. Lets say they irrigate 30% of the land. This allows 160,000 people. This amount will be reached in 5-6 generations or 150 years. Given that there are probably plateus between each stage before new inventions and cultural changes occur, you could add 250 years between each stage. This would make the population cap out at ~160,000 after a little less than 1000 years. Keep in mind that the devastating effect of wars and the like will increase with farming technology, destroying 100 km2 of irrigated farmland will cause 10,000 people to starve the coming year. 

The long game: Nudging other people closer to giving up their soul If few are willing to give up their soul, then an indirect approach might be useful. The devils can recognize that those who actually do give up their soul do so under certain circumstances (despair, to save loved ones, etc.). If so, then they need to create those circumstances. So the demons have two kinds of 'customers'. The first type is one real mark, the ones that with enough manipulation can be made to willingly give up their souls. These may be ones who have contacted the demons as the second category in the past, or totally unknowing victims. The important point is that the demons are in for the long game with these people. They follow them through their entire lives just to create that particular setup where they will have no way out but to call them and offer all they have. The second type is the bulk of their customers. These people gain minor favors in exchange for doing things that push one of the real marks towards their final destination. Typically they will be entirely unaware of the real consequences of their actions and all of them might not appear to be overtly evil (although that depends on what the particular endgame is). It might be things like delivering a letter, closing their store early, convincing their friend to try a new drug, rescuing someone from a peril or pretty much anything. This can be nested to any level. Some devils might be setting up organizations, cults, drug cartels, gangs, insiders in governments etc through pawns and favors which can then be used to favor the long-games of the real marks of other devils. All of it ends with the same thing, people giving up their souls, but the majority of the effort is on the 'enabler structure' rather than the real victims.
