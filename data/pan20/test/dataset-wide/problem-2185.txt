While you may suspect that the candidate was Googling to try and "cheat" on answers, that's really not relevant in this case. 

Most companies are organized enough that they have succession planning and contingency plans for managing work if key members resign (We kind of knew this was already an issue based on your other question about the lack of knowledge sharing). It should not be a matter of a vacuum getting filled by random happenstance. This would seem to be an indication of an organization with problems, from the top down. The chaos and bedlam and the general Lord of the Flies environment that the resignations caused, and the fact that no one seems aware of it and no one has been assigned to take control of it is an indication of an organization with problems. The fact that your senior developer has sole control and knowledge of the codebase you were supposed to be working on, and was able to deflect sharing that knowledge with you, successfully, to avoid others finding out what an undocumented, disorganized mess he had (aka, failure to properly do his job), is an indication of an organization with problems. Generally, people higher up the ladder have more of a feel for the pulse of the company, beyond your own day to day perspective. If you trust your boss, and his boss, as competent professionals, their jumping ship should set off huge alarm bells for you, and serve as a sort of "canary in a coal mine." If your relationship was good with your ex-boss, and you know of a way to contact him, ask about his departure, with assurances that it will be confidential (and keep that promise!). Say that you are a bit unnerved by what followed the resignation, and are evaluating your long-term future with the company. It may be something as simple as his boss getting an awesome offer, and getting to take your boss along with him, which means you shouldn't necessarily be concerned about the long-term viability of your employer. Or it may be that both of them see the company going down in flames, and are jumping ship while the going is good. Other indications you have shared would have me worried that the reason is "option B" in this scenario. 

Option 2: Don't get a headache about this and keep up the good work. Telling the client "you can trust me, you can trust me" like in some sect (just not that directly) has a high chance of backfiring if the client is suspicious right from the start. Another point: Why is it so important to make him believe the result will be satisfying before he/she can see the result? It shouldn't be. As soon as the product is done, if it is satisfying and not overpriced, the client has no reason anymore to believe you want to rip him off. And before that point ... you work, the client pays, and the client has at least enough trust to give the job to you. If there are problems about secret informations or anything like that, and the client hesitates to give it to you to do you work, just ask how you could do it without having it. If it's really necessary, either you get it or there won't be a finished product. The client will understand that (or give you an feasible alternative). 

The exact wording etc. matters in determining if it is valid, but basically it's allowed (HGB ยง60). Unless something else is specifically stated in the contract, it ends immediately when you quit. If is is extended, there are some requirements, notably it's max for two years after quitting and your (former) employer has to pay you at least half of the (former) salary (HGB ยง74 and ยง74a). As for the other point... 

And keep in mind that (depending on the jurisdiction), even an actual offer doesn't mean the have to hire you. ... 

I'd list the company, list all three titles, most recent on top, oldest on the bottom, put in parentheses "titles differ due to being in different departments, significant overlap in duties," then list your job duties there treating it as a general bucket for all three. If anyone is flummoxed by that setup, they'll ask you about it in your interview or phone screen. Include the duties, but if you're interviewing for a job that wants specific technical skills, a laundry list of all tasks you do won't interest them. Stick to relevant ones (will also be taken as an indication that you are paying attention to the job posting and how you might fit). Also, again, you don't just want to list what you did. Companies are very interested in what you've accomplished for your employers. If you made your job better or made the company better, make sure you list that. It's much more important. "In charge of widget inventory system"? or "Took charge of widget inventory system and improved delivery time by 18% and reduced inventory order backlog by 45%." The second is a much more strategic view of what you've done with a demonstrated impact and added value to the company bottom line. If it's more service oriented, then service delivery metrics can be used. 

Recruiters work for their client companies to fill their positions. The client company pays them. They are also in a business where any "leads" might help them to enhance their income. While there are some who are very nice and care about their candidates, there are some with a more impersonal approach. In any case, they are trained to be more coldly business-like. In your case, the recruiter decided you were not a good enough candidate or fit for the position he/she was trying to fill. So you are rejected. Your value as a candidate-commodity, unless they have other positions that might be a better fit, is not much. So, they ask about other positions you are looking at. It might suggest a fit for positions they have that might be better for you..... so far, okay. But that's not really what the conversations were focused on, by your description. Asking about your specific interviews, companies, and people at those companies? This is strictly milking you for valuable "inside" information that will help them to circumvent the standard gauntlet set up to screen people like cold-calling recruiters out. "I'd like to talk to the person who makes hiring decisions for Accounting professionals" "{Click}" "I'd like to speak with Bob AccountingManagerGuy, please." "Please hold, I'll transfer you." If they have information about specific needs or what seems to be exactly what they are looking for, they are more likely to be able to fashion an opening pitch that will grab that person's attention and keep them from hanging up. This recruiter is mining you for information they can use to get a foot in the door with a new client for new positions. Obviously, this gives you no benefit, whatsoever. They will say, perhaps, that they are just "networking," but they seem, in this situation, to have no interest in you beyond potential leads they can get from you. This is part of what I was trained to do as a recruiter. When I got a potential client on the phone, that was great, but I was expected to find out who they knew in other companies. Qualified, heavy-hitting candidates would be great, but a hiring manager or someone with positions to fill? That was pure gold. When talking with candidates, I was expected to try and get names of other candidates, and when I talked to them, I was to try and find out if they could help me to find people with openings or companies that might have openings. 

Don't do anything. Odds are that this individual's previous work will have no effect on your current project. In the unlikely case that there is some sort of public outcry against this individual, issue a simple statement saying that your organization is an equal opportunity employer and that any political beliefs held by individual employees are not representative of the organization. Don't try to solve a problem where there isn't one. 

I actually did leave a software development job before having another lined up, and it worked out well. Leaving a position early can be beneficial, but there are some nuances you should take care of first: 

If you can't meet these criteria, don't leave your current position yet. If you do decide to leave early, take the time between interviews to study for interviews, work on personal development projects (interviewers like to see that you're not just sitting around between employment), and clear your head of the stress from the previous job. 

Toward the end of the work day today, I received a meeting invitation via Outlook from my direct manager. I was in a meeting when I received the invitation, and he had already gone home by the time I got out. The meeting invitation is for a meeting with the CEO, tomorrow morning, before work, at a hotel a few miles from our place of work. The subject is "Meeting with [CEO's first name]" and no further details were provided. The CEO and myself are the only listed attendees. I've briefly met with our CEO in the past, since our company is a small government contractor. In more than a year that I've been with the company, I've never heard of anyone being asked to attend a meeting that wasn't either at our office or on-site with a customer. Our company has no relationship with the hotel that I know of. None of my coworkers appear to have received similar invitations. This seems unprofessional at best. Should I accept this meeting? How should I reply to this? Additional information: I do have my manager's phone number, but he has made it clear that he doesn't want to be contacted outside of work hours unless it's an emergency. I do not have the CEO's phone number. 

First, as the other answer said too, be "very" careful if this is allowed. Probably it isn't - if a client is so important that the companies existance depends it, it is a good hint that you're really being an employee, not a consultant. And other than fines, it might happen that the company must retrospectively pay taxes etc. for you without you getting back the same taxes (meaning, paid two times). This can hurt much more than the fine. Anyways, some stuff about taxes etc. (very rough estimation, and many small things not mentioned at all): Currently, you have 52000 per year on your payslip as "gross" (not really) salary, which makes about 3700 14 times. After insurance and Lst tax, this might be eg. 34000, ie. 2350 14 times (nice - there are more and more web developers getting maybe half of it). However, because many people are just not aware of it, this "gross" isn't really gross - the employer has additional costs which are hidden to you, namely your insurance again (about half, while you see just the other half), and some other taxes and fees. Including this, your gross salary is more like 68000. If you are self-employed, you've to care about this previously hidden part too. Since you want "significantly" more, how about 2700 instead of 2350 - this would be instead 81000 instead of 68000 gross-gross per year. Then ... while Lst and insurance calculation are not that different between self-employed and not, there is also the Umsatzsteuer, 20%. Makes 97000. Since this is yearly, the missing 13+14 month are already in there. Not in there are the missing 25 vacation days, and average 13 (?) sick days. Since without weekends, national holidays, etc., there are about 245 days per year, this 38 days are about 15% which you get not paid anymore as self-employer person. This added makes 112000. Some random small fees collectively considered with 6% (house number, may vary), 119000. (Already more than double, compared to your payslip gross value). To this, add tax consultant, legal expense insurance, costs for computer stuff (hardware, software, server rent, redundant backups, etc.etc.), and of course office space (including rent, cleaning, furniture, electrity, garbage fee, etc.etc. - all of this is also relevant for home office, just not directly on an separate invoice. Also multiply this part with ca. 1.1 because tax details). What you have now would be what you need/want per year - however, you're not earning money for 8 hours a day over the whole year. The last big point is, enough overhead on your hourly rate to live through times without work as well as non-billable work.
