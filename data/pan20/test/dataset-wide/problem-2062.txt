So I have been at my current job for just over three months now and am loving where I work. Just recently I have had to start taking the bus in to the office both in the morning and at night. This bus ride is about an hour each way. When I take the bus in the morning, the one that will get me to the office on time gets me there at 8:00am. The normal start time for the company is 8:30am. I begin work right once I get in the office. At night the buses that I must take work on a tightly wound schedule to each other. One comes at 5:02pm and would make sure I catch the 5:40 bus at home and I will be home by 6. Now if I miss that one I won't get one the first bus until 5:20 causing me to get to the other stop at 6 and the transfer bus doesn't come back until 6:30 and I am not home until almost 7. My company gets off work at 5pm so the hours are 8:30 - 5. Is it ethical for me to start packing my stuff up at 4:55 to ensure I can leave right at 5 and catch the bus home? Is there a better way I could handle this? Any help would be greatly appreciated. 

Tell me what my job is (Job description, as per your contract). Tell me how to do it. (Training. Vital for permanent staff. Should not strictly be necessary if you're selling yourself as a professional, but it is great to get paid to be trained in new skills!). Tell me when I'm doing it right, or not. (Regular reviews with your supervisor (aka Customer) are essential, both for YOU and THEM. That is your time and theirs. It should be used to discuss matters only affecting yourself and not be wasted trying to correct other people's shortcomings. As Jane S. wrote, "...[blockages] need to be raised...". Correct, but are you sure they are not "dating" or "an item" even? Imagine now what names you would call yourself if that was the reason for management's apparent head-in-sand approach toward this employee! and worse: the reason they chose not to renew your contract!). 

If you wish to discuss your contract, then your accountant would be a good place to start. She or he may advise you to either "suck it up" for the remainder of your four months, or approach the appropriate person in the organisation for a review and/or update of your contract. That should be done anyway as the end of your contract approaches. If you don't have an experienced, qualified, accountant then you're not really a professional IMNSHO. A good one will save you more than you pay them, if not, get a different one. Your performance (and possible contract extension/renewal) will be not be assessed on how often you implicitly tell your customer that he is doing his job wrong. It will depend on how well YOU work and fit in with what we called the "permie's" or "permie-burgers!", i.e. the permanent staff. It is unlikely to depend on how adept you are at office politics. As a contractor that 'skill' is best left unused. Unless of course your contract includes provision of (cough) Management Consultancy service(s). {wink}. Never forget: You are probably worth more than you think you are. Don't sell yourself short, and ENJOY what you do.. That is probably more detail than needed, I hope it helps, Mart ~ ~ 

Aside from what's being said already by @kevincline, telling someone that they'll be laid off, then asking them to train other employees to do their job is quite absurd, they'll just tell you to screw you. In fact, asking them to do anything productive will be most likely be met anger. There is really no valid point in keeping an employee that you have laid off. And for an employee, there is absolutely no valid point to stay at work once they know they'll be laid off. 

It's not only for the interest of the company; it's also for your best interest. Imagine that for a reason or another, you stop dating your Manager's brother. And your brother manages to convince you Manager that you've been acting badly toward him. (Let's go to the extreme and let's say he lies and tell his sister that you cheated on him.) Now she'll side with him against you. You'll be in trouble. With you not having to interact directly with that person (the Manager) at work, you're free to live your life, without fearing having your personal relationship interfere (in a good or in a bad way) with your professional life. 

Here is a couple of thoughts: Asking an employee about his/her mood on a daily basis is, IMHO, very intrusive to their private life. Theoretically, a persons mood should not affect the work. It's not the case in practice, but a lot of people just don't want that to affect their work and thus make big efforts to not display bad moods and let these affect their work. These persons would probably consider the application irrelevant and would chose the first/default value. Also, you don't mention what kind of App, but if my boss were to force me to install an app on my phone, I would again find that very intrusive, and I would probably find all the reasons in the world to postpone the installation and set up, and then I would probably try to find another job. 

Generally I have found most of the large adult oriented sites out there are developed and maintained by a company under a different name. If you look at the PornHub network (pornhub, redtube, brazzers) those sites are developed and maintained by a company known as MindGeek. Try searching for the companies in charge of the sites and not search so much for the site names themselves. 

As a new programmer in the workplace (started in May) I believe I can answer this. I had the same fears when I first started. I would get nervous submitting my code for review and generally second guessed myself. I got over this by writing personal projects at home and getting confident in my code itself. I believed I didn't know much (look up impostor syndrome) and it caused me a great deal of stress. However after delivering multiple working projects and having some that have been sold to customers and made the company money, my fear started to go away. I still get nervous but not to the same extent because I know I do provide some value. Do your best to find a personal project or two to work on and build up your skill and self confidence. Nobody knows everything in coding so learn how to learn and grow my friend. Good Luck. 

I have been at a new full time job as a Software Developer now for just over 3 months. I got this job right out of college (literally 2 weeks after I graduated). I love working here and I love my co workers but one of them intimidates me quite a bit and I am always afraid to ask him questions or approach him. I always get my work done on time and this co worker is the head technician (not software as it's a different team) and not my boss but I find myself needing his services often because I work on phone systems and he hooks up whatever I need at my desk. This co worker I have heard can get moody quickly and you don't want to be on his bad side. I have never upset him but he always is very serious. It could in the future pose a problem for me because I don't like asking him for help and find myself procrastinating instead of approaching him. Can anyone give me some advice on how to approach this situation? 

If they see employees as an investment instead of an expense, they'll probably take the extra mile to define their needs, and write a job description accordingly. IMHO, if they don't do that, and you feel they should, maybe the company's values are not in line with yours. Job hunting is a serious activity, if they're not serious about it, you should not take their offers seriously. Asking for a job description is reasonable (dude, what have I got myself into??), and if you smell something fishy, there is probably something fishy. 

You don't specify the the reason for leaving a job (or being laid off, or being fired) on a resume. If you're asked, you explain the situation during the interview. Otherwise, there is no need to explain it. 

You don't have to tell where you heard it, just that you heard about it and you were curious of what were the plans for you (unless, off course, he asks where you heard it). Be prepared for a change, and be ready to adapt. 

I have never been required to show the actual paper proving I have completed a degree in an interview. Now, you still should not lie on your CV, and the same should be applied to job interviews. So the advice is: be honest. On your CV you can formulate it to say that you completed all the requirements for Master X, and that you've passed all the classes in the programme for Master Y. HR and recruiters are not dumb and will notice the difference in the formulation on your CV, so, during the interview, explain the situation. Depending on the job and on the degree(s), the paper proving that you completed a master might not be important, and your application for a job could still be considered. (For instance, where I live, the title 'engineer' is ruled by laws; you must absolutely prove that you have completed an engineering degree, so you would not be allowed to have a job that would make you an engineer. On the other hand, if the job you're seeking is for a programmer job, generally, your skills will be considered, and not whether you fully completed a Master's degree.) 

My background: I was a freelancer working in electronic systems in the 1970's and then computing during the 1980's and 90's, here in the UK. During that time my wife and I raised a family and we now own and live in, without mortgage, a modest three bedroom home in a good neighbourhood (Surrey Heath). Our home is currently valued at around £250,000 (EU: €351641.60, US: $387262.50 according to google). In the 70's I was a sub-sub-sub-sub-contractor which meant other people got wealthy, while I did all the work, but I digress... I retired, partly for health reasons, at age 50. The term used for us in the 80's and 90's was "Contract { Skill-level | Function }" e.g. Contract Senior Systems Analyst/Programmer or "{ Computer | name of language | Function ] Contractor" e.g. Computer Contractor, COBOL Contractor, or according to my accountant, Tax-efficient LTD (US: LLC) Contractor! Takeaway: My points are: I may know what I am writing about. Be your own boss. This was some while ago (hopefully still useful to somebody). Other regions on Earth may vary, and... MOST importantly for this discussion... that somewhere along the line the emphasis on contract seems to have been lost. Assuming that you have a contract with the company / corporation concerned then carry on reading. You may wish to set aside your engineering approach to this issue (Shock, Horror! OK, just for a short while). View youself as a business person might see you. There are some subtle differences! I have never described myself as an engineer. I have been everything from shop (US: store) assistant through coder to Department head at a sub of a huge US Corp. I've been an employee, a contractor, and hired (and fired) both. I believe that your intellect, your qualifications, and a large measure of common sense is your best guide. Your mission is entirely your call and if you document it and and refer to it often, it will form a large part of your individual success. The job (that you do for the organisation buying your services) should be exactly as specified in the contract, no less, and no more. You didn't specifically ask about strategy, but that is very important, and again, that is your call i.e. you figure it out. I learned some of the above the hard way from experience. I later realised that at least two out of three of a Personnel department's "Three Tells" for permanent staff can be applied to Contracting/Consulting:-
