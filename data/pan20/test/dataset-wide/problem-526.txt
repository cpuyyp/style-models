There was an article in the CTC magazine recently about a guy who'd built one. Their website has a FAQ which might be of interest. Details include: 

This blog post is a few years old, but discussed the detail of a study comparing fasting or fed regimes in training. There are also claims of long-term health improvements, I think these are less well-studied, but there is some relevant research. It does also help to lose weight, or improve power-to-weight ratio, although that may not be of interest to the OP. If you're actually thinking of doing it, one of the essential points is to have a good recovery meal after training. 

Cages have the advantage that they can be used with normal shoes. To get your foot into them you push it in from the rear and (optionally) reach down and tighten the strap. In my opinion this is pretty fiddly and potentially hazardous. Getting your foot out is a case of pulling backwards, possibly after having to reach down and loosen the strap. Not quick. Clipless pedals (which I prefer to call cleated) look like this: 

On a bit of a tangent, but have you considered a cardboard bicycle? This would only meet one of your requirements - a low environmental cost. It certainly wouldn't last 100 years, but might have less environmental impact over 100 years even if replaced several times as it's certainly easy to recycle. This is if it's as great as the inventor claims. :-) 

Last night I tried picking the dirt out with needle-nose pliers, chiselling it with a nail and hammer and even resorted to trying to drill the bolt out. This last attempt barely damaged the bolt, but heated it up so much the bottom of the shoe started to melt. Is there any way to prevent this from happening or to fix it when it does? 

Better aerodynamics due to narrower hand placement and especially when in the drops. Multiple hand positions for improved comfort. 

More accurate control at low speeds Better visibility (by me and of me) due to upright position Easier one-handed control for signalling 

I think the first step would be to work out what is causing them to fall out of alignment. Possibilities include: 

If the change often occurs at the same time and in the same way as that described so thoroughly above, it could add up to something very noticeable. Secondly, I would assume that a wet road would cause additional rolling resistance as the tire has to move aside or pick up a little water as it rolls. I can certainly detect additional road noise on wet, or even damp, days, so this energy must be coming from somewhere. 

It's a question of ergonomics. Ensure you try out the levers before you buy them. Depending on the size of your hands you may find braking awkward from the hoods. I tried Shimano brifters and found I couldn't comfortably operate the brakes from the hoods (I have smaller than average hands). It felt like the pivot point was too low, so that unless I reached far down the lever with my middle finger I didn't get much, erm, leverage. The top part of the hood is also fatter with Shimano, so this might have been a factor too. This was the main reason I chose Campagnolo brifters, which I found much more comfortable on the hoods. I doubt there is a difference in reaction speed to apply the brakes, but bad ergonomics may affect how hard you can apply them. It's certainly true that you get more power when braking in the drops, but that isn't a comfortable position for long periods. I prefer not to take my drop-bar bike in traffic and generally take the hybrid (flat bar) if towns are involved. 

This could be coming from the bottom bracket, which will make noise when worn out and pedalling under load. One way to test this is to stand beside the bike, grab one crank in each hand and see if they can be rocked towards/away from the frame. There should be no play in this direction. This is described with pictures here. If that's not the problem, then the following link has a rather comprehensive list of possible causes of bike noises. 

Take some time when you're not in traffic to have a look at the way the pedal hangs naturally, when you're unclipped. In my case, my one-sided Shimano SPD-road pedals always hang cleat-side down. So to clip in without looking, I put my toe underneath and roll up from the back, staying in contact with the pedal the whole time. This doesn't always work, but it's more reliable than guessing and stamping. Take extra care in the rain as I find the (metal) non-cleat side of the pedal can be very slippery when wet. I've learnt through painful experience that staying seated until cleated is best! 

Whether a folding bike is worthwhile for you would depend entirely on how you intend to use it. There's an argument for saying that the average rail commuter would be better served by two cheap/secondhand hybrid/mountain bikes locked at the start/end train stations, because: 

It depends on how you intend to use the bike. If you're intending to race, you'll probably want something lightweight and very grippy. If you're commuting or touring you should tend towards the durable end of the tire spectrum With a nice steel frame like that you'll get lots of comfort, so it seems to "fit" with putting wider, comfortable, durable tires on it. A wider tire is more comfortable with the only disadvantage being that it is a bit heavier. If the bike originally had 28mm tires, I would expect it to take 25-35mm with no problem, but check the rims for any other indication. The two you've listed don't have a great reputation for durability, so it may be worth investing a little more for something that will last longer and save you the frustration of punctures. Consider Continental Gatorskins or Schwalbe Marathons. Both are more expensive, but offer good puncture protection which, in the long run, shortens your journey time more than a few grams of weight saving. 

In case 1, you can remove the screws and refit them with some threadlocker (a weak glue that keeps machine screws/nuts in place, usually blue in bike applications). In cases 2 and 3, the stays may be getting bent or fastenings rotated, in which case all you can do it be careful how you park the bike and where you leave it. 

First let's clarify the difference between "clipless" and "clip" pedals. They are confusing terms as both have clips. Clip pedals (which I prefer to call cages) look like this: 

The best kind of saddle for touring is one which you find comfortable. The cut-out is intended to relieve pressure from your soft bits leaving most of your weight on your sit-bones. A very wide saddle might start to rub excessively inside your thigh on a long ride, while one with springs may be too bouncy at higher cadences and waste some of your effort. A saddle is a personal choice and there is certainly no one ideal, "best" touring saddle for all people. Given that you "love" your Brooks, I'd suggest looking at another Brooks (maybe a narrower one), or if you're confident it will be comfortable over longer distances, use your B66. 

If you have a soldering iron and some solder, that may stop it from fraying further, but won't make it any less sharp. You could consider a bit of alu foil, but I doubt this would stay on. Perhaps with some glue suitable for metal? Perhaps a small cable tie done up super-tight with pliers? 

While I agree with cherouvim that wet lube is a good thing for rust prevention, I would also ask if it's possible to store the bike higher up, perhaps with some kind of simple cover to prevent the rain and salt-spray from getting to it. Perhaps a couple of hooks on the wall and some rope or a simple bench or couple of large stones to stand the bike on. Whatever magical product you treat it with, all parts of a bike are going to suffer from being repeatedly immersed in salt-water. 

I would expect brake blocks to wear out, to the point of needing replacement, much faster than rims. However, the rims may look gouged or a little rough, long before that. Both will wear out faster if you are riding in dirty/gritty conditions. The rate of wear can also depend on the kind of rim blocks you use. In my experience it's worth investing in good brake blocks to preserve your much more expensive rims. When choosing blocks, there is also a bit of a trade-off between braking power and wear on the rims. Several people I know who do very high mileage recommend Swisstop Green, which are apparently kind to the rims and provide reasonable stopping power in all conditions. Others swear by Koolstop Salmon for their stopping power, although they may wear the rims a bit more. Whatever you use it's a good idea to remove any bits of grit/metal from the blocks regularly as this will wear the rims much faster than any block. 

Then it might be more complicated. Then again, perhaps the arm can be disconnected with a single pin, I haven't tried it. The two cables under the black flexible plastic cable covers will also need to be disconnected. I'm not sure how hard that is. 

Conventional wisdom says that your hands ought to be the same width apart as you shoulder bones, although personal preference should trump this. I've also read that, strangely, stem length can affect whether bars feel too narrow or not. It's a shame that for most of us it's not economical/convenient to get various combinations and try them out for comfort. You can try different sizes in a shop, but other aspects of the bike may also change. As a reference point, there's some discussion of handlebar size and how to measure your shoulders, here. 

Whenever I remove or refit the mudguards, or even sometimes just getting the wheel out, they seem to go slightly off-centre, by which I mean rotated around the mounting. The effect of this is that, when the brakes are applied one pad contacts the rim before the other. Looking carefully the wheel also moves a little to the left or right as one pad pushes it to the side. I try to rotate the brakes so that both pads contact the rim at the same time to minimise this movement, but as the act of tightening the mounting screw also rotates the brakes slightly, this is tricky. So the question is - does it matter much if one pad makes contact slightly before the other? What are the likely effects of it doing so? 

Yes, you can use them with normal shoes, but as you predict, it isn't very comfortable, especially if your shoes have thin, flexible soles. Also, there's a risk of your foot slipping off, particularly in the wet. There are various options to temporarily convert clip pedals into ordinary flat ones. 

Average speed is a useful measure for estimating your arrival time. It's a simpler calculation (see other answers). It is possible to estimate the effort involved in a ride, taking into account the elevation gained. See $URL$ Most competitive cycling sees winners as those who completed the course in the shortest time, which is related to average speed - distance/time. If you're going up and down the same large hill, it might take 30 minutes to climb and 5 minutes to descend. In terms of doing it in the shortest time, improving your climbing speed by 10% is going to make more difference than improving your descending speed by the same amount, saving 6 mins instead of 1 minute.

You may be best to take the old one into your local bike shop and ask if they can find something for you. 

However, both of these mean it takes you longer to get going again, so you might miss the gap in the traffic you're waiting for. 

I'm interested in road bike tires and how width affects how long they last. It seems common-sense that a wider tire would wear better, as there's simply more of it to "spread" the wear, but I'd like to know if this is true in practice. Answers based on experience or actual studies/research would both be interesting. I'd normally run wider tires at a lower pressure appropriate to the load, but this may make comparison harder. Could braking and cornering have different effects on tire wear? For example, perhaps wider tires wear less in braking, but more due to cornering. If this was the case then the answer might depend on how much braking/cornering the rider does. There might also be a difference between the front and back tire. 

There are good reasons to avoid using a very worn chain for to long as it can wear the cassette requiring both to be replaced. I doubt that a small amount of play in the bottom bracket would move the chain enough to cause unusual wear to the chain, rings or sprockets. There may be more chance of a problem on a single speed or fixed gear bike where the chain has less give. There's a small risk of poor shifting with a wobbly bottom bracket, so perhaps take care and avoid any gears which rub. Otherwise, as long as the shop replaces like for like, you shouldn't have a problem. Likewise, worn gears should not adversely affect your bottom bracket. 

I think your two main criteria should be: comfort and reliability. On a tour, both of these factors have a big effect on your speed as well as your enjoyment. With that in mind you should probably aim to get a steel (or possibly aluminium frame). The good news is that steel lasts well, so buying second hand is a good option. Obviously check for signs of rust before buying. Carbon is not usually considered a good choice for a touring bike. Saddles are a personal preference thing. I suggest buying a cheap one of medium width and not too much padding. Make sure you give it a good try well in advance of the trip. If it doesn't work for you they're easy to change. 50-60km a day is probably fine, unless you aim to finish the day at a significantly higher altitude than the start. I've forgotten to take this into account when planning and ended up quite cold camping in the mountains! 

I've noticed a small puddle of light oil beneath the rear wheel of our Rohloff-equipped tandem. I'm told that a small amount of leakage is normal and I'm not worried about that. The issue is that a lot of it falls on the rim and the tire. Obviously it's bad news on the rim for braking, so I'll be wiping it off and possibly cleaning with diluted degreaser. My question is: is exposure to light oil likely to damage the tire? I know some rubbers can be sensitive to certain chemicals, so is hub oil/bike tires (in this case Schwalbe Marathons) such a combination? I would've thought someone else would have had this problem if so, but I'd like to check. More generally, are there any products/chemicals should I keep away from tires for fear of degrading the rubber? 

The other reason you'd want 650b on a road bike is if you're a smaller rider (say 5ft 5in or less), or you're keen on very low trail. In these situations, slightly smaller wheels fit a smaller frame better, when 700C wheels might result in toe-overlap or uncomfortable geometries. The details are explained here. The downside is that 650b tyres are harder to find, especially for road bikes. 

Truing a wheel and lacing spokes is a big deal, but even a novice like me can replace a spoke and get it good enough to ride if a single spoke breaks. Unless you have a really low spoke count (which seems unlikely on a tour), breaking a single spoke shouldn't make the wheel unrideable and replacing the spoke can improve things and prevent them from getting worse. Spokes are light and can be slipped down the edge of a bag or taped to a tube. Things are made a little more complicated if the broken spoke is next to your disc or cassette. If so you may not have space to lace the new one in. In that case you'll need the tools and expertise to remove the disc or cassette too. I've heard you can often get away without a spoke or two if you adjust the adjacent ones (loosen on opposite side to broken one, tighten on same side). This isn't a long-term solution, but may be good enough to get you home.
