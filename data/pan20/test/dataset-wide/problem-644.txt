I'm considering replacing my threaded aluminum forks, threaded headset, steel threaded stem and steel handlebars with threadless carbon forks, threadless headset and integrated carbon stem and handlebars; a large reduction in weight on my 700c road bike. Aside from weight, what performance differences (if anything) should I notice or expect from the 1.0" threaded (guess) / 1 1/8" threadless headset change? Smoother turning? Or had the change in the industry been motivated on weight/production considerations? One thing that I miss from the threaded setups is that the stem and forks can be engaged in a much stronger connection, such that it would take way more force to make them move independently. On my threadless setups, I can still force the handlebars to turn independent of the wheel, as the stem bolts strip out before they would provide as much clamping force as a threaded setup. 

Would you consider clipless pedals instead of clipped platform? This is probably the most turning clearance for the dollar, second to replacing the crank arms with shorter ones. A set of these pedals will improve your power output as you can pull harder on the upstrokes, as well as shaving probably ~1" or more off your pedal clearance. 

One downside is that they are terrible to ride on without shoes designed to clip in, though some types (like SPD) have shoes with the clipless hardware recessed into the sole for easier walking. 

Another reason for this is that two-pivot varieties have an opportunity to recenter themselves better than single pivot. This reduces friction from one side dragging on the rim, and also contributes to why good road bikes that use them will frequently use the dual pivot calliper brakes. 

I am nearly certain the answer is no. Any metal or hard plastic will flex very little compared to the rubber of the tire, which flexes more than you think. There is no glue I have ever heard of or used, including the Gorilla glues and epoxies, that would ever hold these two together - it'd essentially have to be so strong that the rubber won't flex under your weight as you ride, and unless it's top secret I'd just sum it up to be: that doesn't exist and probably never will. I'd even go further and say even if you got them joined, it wouldn't be a very good or effective tire. If money's really that tight, look for used studded tires on craigslist or eBay - some will be half retail, at least, and may actually help your traction. Drilling, however, is not hard. You select a screw that protrudes from the lug by the amount you want (1/8" or so for a bicycle would be appropriate), screw it in with a drill from the outside so there's a hole on the inside, then screw it through from the inside out. Then you need to line the inside with rim tape so that the screw heads don't pop your inner tube, but if you do this yourself, they probably will (there aren't enough tire/metal bands like a motorcycle/vehicle tire to keep the screws in place, they'll start pushing into the tube and eventually get through). In my opinion, neither option is good, or would do anything for your traction besides waste your time. 

I bought Nickel Anti-Seize to prevent any corrosion issues between metals, and I generally like using it on my vehicles on bolts and anything I plan on removing later. I'm wondering where it would be appropriate for me to use Anti-Seize instead of grease on my bicycle, and where it would be considered a 'no-no.' The nickel type is very corrosion resistant, and temperature resistant to 2400 degrees. My current thinking would be along these lines: Desirable 

My understanding is that most US mountain/road bikes are measured from the center of the bottom bracket shell to the top of the seat tube, European road bikes are center of the bottom bracket shell to the center of the intersection of the top tube and seat tube, and BMX bikes are from the center of the top tube intersections between the seat and head tube. Summary: 

I'm new to road bikes, but have been building mountain bikes for many years. I purchased a cheap road bike (at BSO price level) which I am upgrading for fun. I'd like to upgrade the brakes to something quality, as the brakes it came with barely slow me down. It has some side pull, single pivot generic brakes on it, and I'm wondering if I can upgrade to side pull dual pivot name brand brakes (Shimano 105/Ultegra or similar) without any other changes. 

This is all my guessing based on BMX racing when I was younger, but getting ahead of the pack out of the starting gate is a rather big deal. Once you're behind or right next to someone else, you sometimes have to tap the brakes to avoid them, so there's a huge advantage to this sudden rush of acceleration. This would be a clue as to at least an upper limit on gearing. You might have some advantage to higher gearing after the starting gate, but you wouldn't have the quick burst and you'd probably spend much of the race making up for it. Much of the gear selection from at least stock BMX bikes has to do with age; I remember having a lot of difficulty with how high mine was geared because of my age. This would be why some youth-oriented BMX bikes have low gearing, although this doesn't apply at all to professional circuits. 

I put the cable in, find a length that's 'approximate enough', and crimp the cable end onto the cable before I clamp it into the derailleur. This will prevent the end from fraying, like you say, and becoming difficult to deal with. It will get flattened under the derailleur clamp, but this can't be avoided. If you don't crimp the end in first (or leaving it long is another way, but it doesn't always work), then you will have to deal with the frayed cable and sometimes need to wind it back together to get it into the cable end. 

In my experience, however, I have a hard time bunnyhopping a road bike, especially with the seat positioned 'properly.' With legs near full extension, I find it extremely difficult; by contrast I can easily bunnyhop my BMX or mountain bike 2 feet consistently without issue. If you want to do more stunt-oriented riding, perhaps take a look at your frame size/tire volume/seat height configuration, and consider a different bicycle if they can't be adjusted for this type of riding. Part of your question has to do with speed; and if you have the technique down, speed just makes it easier. The faster you are going, the less you'll have to get your timing perfect; you'll be above the curb for longer. (Just don't be late). If you are a bit early, you may dent your rear rim, but it probably won't make you crash. Once you have the technique, your confidence should grow with it. Then again, I do wheelies, stoppies, and sit on my motorcycle's tank in traffic and frequently pass 100MPH on public roads. If you're not willing to take the risk, then don't. If you are; practice. 

It looks like some builders call this the 'Race Lace,' and by pre-bending the spokes near the elbows will allow crossed patterns to be laced in this way. $URL$ details this method and even shows 5x done on a 36 hole rim/hub: 

Chainrings are sold as having a specific compatibility for only certain speed setups, some overlapping across many. What physically makes this the case? From what I understand, 5/6/7/8/9 speed chains all have the same internal width, 3/32", and the only difference is the external width of the chain. Does this also extend through 10/11 speeds as well, or do they have smaller internal widths which would necessitate skinnier chain rings as well? Or is it the case that the external width just keeps shrinking? IF the difference is only the external width, then it would seem the only compatibility issues would not be in the chainrings themselves, but the spacing in between each one. If it was too small/too wide a chain, the chain would hit the next chainring, and if it was significantly too large the chain may fall in between rings. However, it would seem that you could use the same rings with a wider chain (9 speed rings with a 5/6/7/8 speed chain) if you put appropriate spacers between the rings, such as these. The opposite may be possible if you're willing to grid / mill the appropriate amount off the mounting pad. What this would also imply is that with the right width spacers (and bolts that can accomodate them) you could always go down speeds with a given set of chainrings. If that is not the case (say 11 speeds have a different internal width), then they might be too wide for the chain an you'd have to remove material near the teeth to make them fit inside the chain or conversely that you'd be wearing on less of the chain than you should so your chain wouldn't last as long. Furthermore, some rings are marketed as 5/6/7/8 speed only, some 9 speed only, and some 5/6/7/8/9 compatible. Is this some sort of blending of the two specifications (the spacing being some compromise between true 8/9 speeds) or just that they're made for one but tested to work on the other (or just a marketing trick)? 

Yes; as long as you get a 7/8/9 speed compatible chainring set. If you mean a strictly 9 speed labeled chainring set; Maybe. The more I look it seems opinion is divided between whether 6/7/8 speed chainrings are interchangeable with 9 speeds or not. A 9 speed chain is slightly narrower than a 6/7/8 speed chain, and this is especially important for the cassette. The distance from tooth-tooth is the same, though. I've also seen some chainrings advertised as 8/9 speed compatible such as BBB Roundabout chainrings (8/9 speed compatible printed on the ring) or this set on eBay (Mowa MTB Chainring Set). There is a possiblity that they are mistaken about the compatibility as @zenbike suggests, but both of those sources have good return policies. It is worth noting that Sheldon Brown describes this as a non-issue in either direction. 

Unequivocally, yes, you can - it's just a matter of whether or not it's worth it to you. Without seeing pictures or details: to avoid unnecessary added expense, you'll want to stick with frames that have: 

Note: this calculation makes many assumptions, so it's only useful in an 'average use case', not some sort of exact measurement. If you find better information, please post it and I'll update the answer. How many pumps you would need to fill up a tire depends on many variables. First, the volume of your inner tube, which can be approximated as a torus (doughnut-shape) atop the rim size of a given diameter. You can find yours approximated on this graph. 

Long term consequences are doubtful. From my mountain biking experience, mounting a tire directionally backward just hurt your traction as it wouldn't clear mud/operate as designed, but once it was returned it worked properly, and it didn't hurt the tire any. 

If you only know the pitch of the chain (standard for most bicycles) and number of teeth, then you can fully describe the circle (and n-gon) through the pin centers only. I will do my best to do the math formulas in a readable way with text, but I will fully describe each of the four circles/n-gons: 

Basically; are there things to check for that would make some side-pull cantilever road brakes non-compatible with any others? 

Side note: I like to drop and hop curbs (though I haven't even been able to attempt it on the road bike), there are frequently metal shavings or other sharp objects on my garage floor, and I live in a neighborhood with lots of cracks and potholes. Should I just give up on road bikes and stick with my mountain bike? 

$URL$ will let you upload the file and view it on a map $URL$ is a site I wrote that will analyze the file and return some analysis on it if you pick an activity (Flying, Driving, Hiking, etc.) I should probably add bicycling. Any number of tools (including the Garmin software that comes with their GPS units) that will allow you to visualize the data 'off device'.
