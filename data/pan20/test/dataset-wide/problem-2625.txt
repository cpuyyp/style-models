The events of the world are not predetermined, as shown above, they are what we do with the world around us by using our free will to decide between things that are possible for us. In the same manner, our thoughts are mostly common/usual responses that each individual's brain has as a result of repetition. We can slowly change the way we think, as well as the nature of our thoughts; this means that we have some measure of free will even in our thoughts. Our effort is the amount of work/energy we decide to apply to something; and if we had some measure of free will when it came to our thoughts, we have all of it when it comes to the amount of effort we decide to apply to something. 

Couple that with Baudrillard saying that today there is no such thing as reality! That the world we live in is only a Simulacrum! That we live from images and only images! Images, surfaces, appearances. 

you could try something from danto: an essay like the art world, or a book like after the end of art. you would get quite a lot out of them. or something by richard wollheim - art and its objects. these are quite highly regarded art critics who also had a rigorous philosophical training. 

upon seeing the much discussed movie - arrival: how far can one stretch the sapir-whorf hypothesis? could it transcend space and take over time? could a language, however complicated, once learned allow those who speak it to see events that are about to happen (let alone things that'll happen in 3000 years)? if that should work (?) why would the UG not be able to do the same (sometime in the future, following evolution's path)? 

Let's explore your teacher's irksome claim. 1) According to Plato, which is what your teacher is claiming, there are Forms of beauty, mountains, colors, courage, love, justice, goodness, etc. 2) Therefore, according to Plato, there are Forms of objects (like mountain) and attributes (like color). Also, there is a Form of love. Love is a feeling, a force, a relationship between a being and something else, and a bio-chemical mental state. We can then say that there is a Form of relationships like love and hate. 3) Force, as in F=ma, is a force, and therefore has a Form. There is also a Form for mass, and another one for acceleration. F=ma is a relationship describing things that already have Forms. Therefore, if we can find a Form of a relationship between things that already have a Forms, your teacher is right. 4) Justice is a relationship between an event/action, like a crime, and a particularly-satisfying result, such as a punishment. Beauty is a relationship between a set of characteristics/attributes, like big eyes, that when perceived as a whole produce pleasure in the observer. There is a Form for beauty, eye, punishment, and crime. Your professor is correct, “F = ma” is indeed a Platonic Form. What bothers you about it is the same thing that bothers me, and the same thing that bothered Aristotle, and the same thing that seems to have bothered Plato himself later on: there is a problem with Platonic Forms. However, your teacher did not claim that the forms are true. He claimed that “F = ma” is a Platonic Form, and he was right. PS: Whether he was right for the right reasons or it's purely coincidental, remains unknown. Also, whether one can be right without knowing it, is a different matter. Your teacher was right when he said it, as per the meaning of "right" you had in your mind when you posted this question. Hope this helps! 

you can look at this the other way around as well, and you don't need to take into account the sapir-whorf hypothesis. words, as well as languages, change over time also because they adapt to the way the world changes. i don't know if any teenager from last century would be able to begin anything with a millennial's vocabulary. it's not like we have a fixed set of words which we use over and over again to make sense of the same reality. our daily lives change, so does the way we grasp it with our words. that's why we make up new words, we use metaphors (new ones, though not always fortunate), we import words, etc. so, i would say it's a two-way street, it's a continuous exchange between the way the world is and the way we represent it in language. 

I agree with you Dvij, I can tell you are sincere in your search for truth and I myself came to a very similar point in my life. This is why I am going to try my best to give you the answer I have found for this problem. I agree with you that results from a moment of action/inaction are determined by the laws/rules governing nature. I also agree that this applies to every moment of action/inaction. We can call a moment of action/inaction by a different name, "the previous situation", because that was the state of the world that was changed into the resulting state of the world by that action/inaction. In other words, a "previous situation" is indeed what caused the resulting state of the world/reality, because it is made of two elements: the previous state of the world and the action/inaction that changed it. However, even if we didn't have a choice about what the previous state of the world was, we still definitely had free will when it comes to the action/inaction that we took and that resulted in the next state of the world (with the exception perhaps of some mental illnesses which might completely or partially dictate a person's actions, but I'll ignore those in this answer due to their low incidence/prevalence in the population). This free will is evidenced by the great sense of freedom we have right now about getting up from our chairs and jumping out of a window, laying on the floor shouting, going outside and jumping over the neighbor's fence, studying hard for an exam, or doing a cartwheel into the bathtub. We can decide to do any of those things right now, and every moment of our lives we have many things we can do. We decide, and that is free will. There are many things we can't do, like teleporting to a friend's house, traveling back in time 20 years, or turning rocks to gold; but the reason for that is not that we don't have free will, it's that it's impossible to us. Therefore free will is the ability to decide what to do between the things that are possible for us. Because of this, it is true that the events of the world are just the results of the application of the rules of nature on the previous situation of the world (which is comprised of the previous state of the world and what we decided to do/not do with our free will at the time). 

history is there to analyse records of the past: what happened, when, where and (perhaps) why. it asks questions that can be answered by researching documents and other traces of the past. philosophy asks different questions - about being, values, consciousness, etc. it goes back to its own history of asking this kind of questions in order to build on the answers it accumulated so far, trying to avoid those answers that proved to be wrong or lead nowhere. you can memorize who said what but that does not give you answers to these questions, at least not in a helpful/meaningful/concrete way. 

Our efforts have not been predetermined, as shown above, but the importance of our efforts lies in that they strongly influence the likelihood of success in what we apply them to. I honestly hope this aids you in your quest for truth. 

Perhaps, or perhaps not; luckily for us that is not the case because it is not true (as shown above). However, even if it were true, there might still be some intrinsic worth to moral values. Success, defeat, and winning are not moral values; but they would certainly have no meaning if hard-determinism were true. 

According to this (at least when it comes to citations and ratings), the most influential philosophers are continental/analytical and are active in either US or Britain. Are there any important Eastern and Central European philosophers working, teaching and writing today (except Zizek, of course)? Are there any openly available and updated resources on this issue? 

I find the question interesting but also slightly misleading. Tolerance is, by definition, something that reflects a willingness to accept behaviors or opinions one dislikes. I wouldn’t call it hypocrisy even though it might point into that direction. Saul Bellow once said that “if the Zulu will produce a Dostoevsky, we’ll read him.” An affirmation which, unfortunately, does not need much explanation. This is, then, how tolerance really looks like: expecting the other’s behavior or opinions to change in order to match my own. Kwame A. Appiah suggested we should agree on a set of basic human rights on which we should make no compromises. Beyond that, “there’s a wide range of things where it’s up to each human being and each community of human beings to make up their own minds about how they are going to do it.” Ideally, we should thus be tolerant of difference and not of dislike and, since intolerance should not be part of the basic human rights we shouldn’t worry too much about not being tolerant of intolerance. 

Christof was on target when he said that there is no more truth in the real world than there is in Seahaven, - if and only if you believe that truth is relative and subjective. In that case, had they surrounded Truman with Muppets all his life and made him believe that the entire planet was populated by Muppets except for Truman because Truman was an alien wizard; then that would be the truth too. I can't accept that. On the other hand, if you believe otherwise, then Christof was wrong and was just desperately trying to keep his show in business and his star/slave from quitting. It is worth noting that his argument for there being no more truth outside than inside was: "Same lies. Same deceit. But in my world, you have nothing to fear." That seems dubious and weak, so even if the statement had been true (and Christof really believed it), you could argue that Christof was not right since his belief was not justified (a.k.a. he believed it for the wrong reasons). Completely unrelated to Christof, however, there would still be people who believe that that the truth inside is true inside and the truth outside is true outside; and that both are valid truths. I can't believe that the Muppets could be a truth, and by extension I can't believe that there can be multiple truths. Similarly, I can only think of two famous proponents of this, like Gandhi: 

As Chris Sunami mentioned, Danto is a very good starting point for this. In one of his essays in Philosophizing Art, Danto writes about "The Philosopher as Andy Warhol", praising him for his genius (a remark which, he mentions, almost cost him his friendship with Robert Motherwell). For Danto, Warhol was almost something like a... Nietzsche of Art, actually bringing painting to its knees and surrendering it to philosophy. The discussion surfaced, of course, while attempting to distinguish between the Brillo box that was not art and the Brillo box that was (which, by the way, was designed by an abstract expressionist – Steve Harvey and is packed with symbols). What makes one art and the other a soap box? Well, the answer comes, they are, actually, both art. But one of them is commercial art and the other one is fine art. By doing what he did best, Warhol turned our world, our soap boxes and soup cans and whatever have you into art. The boundaries between art and the world got blurred. Danto thinks that: 

No, the State would not be responsible. As you state yourself, all of the rulings mentioned pertain to situations where the police are involved. The gun-control issue has nothing to do with the police, thereby voiding any precedent you tried to establish before posing the question. It would be hard to prove that the individual getting assaulted in the example would not have gotten assaulted anyway if gun control legislature had not been passed. In fact, the opposite is just as likely to be true: that individual may have gotten assaulted exactly because the assaulter had easier access to a gun thanks to gun control legislation not getting passed. It would be hard to imagine someone arguing that the State was responsible for the assault because the gun-control legislation was not passed. It is even possible that the person assaulted would've gotten assaulted on multiple occasions instead of just once if previous gun-control legislation had not been passed.
