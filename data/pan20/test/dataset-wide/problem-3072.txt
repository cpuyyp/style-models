This is further echoed by Mieth and Bork, who make a strong case that evidence of agricultural activity on the Island points to a much earlier settlement date. 

The Lexington had been taken prize by the British on September 19th, and was put up for repairs in Dover shortly before the loss of Reprisal, as noted in The Public Advertiser (London), 3 October 17772: 

The following passage from Incidents of Travel in Central America, Chiapas and Yucatan would lend some credence to the first two explanations of remarkable discoveries of a fallen civilization:

Image from $URL$ The photo paper stamp would put the ship in theater during Vietnam, where it both ran supplies and assisted in supporting the "Brown Water navy" operating in the Mekong Delta. That would date the photo sometime between 1966 and 1969 (probably later based on the stamps on the back of the print). You can find some additional information about the ship's service history at the Mobile Riverine Force Association website. 

It apparently didn't have much passing power, as the top speed was specified at a blazing fast 4.8 miles per hour and it didn't achieve that in practice. Edit: After a bit of searching, I found a reference to a specific date that the testing started, which is given as October 20th, 1769 at the Paris Arsenal. Note that there aren't any citations given on the page, so I can't verify it (even if I could read French). The original concept seems to have been proposed in Cugnot's 1766 book Éléments de l'art militaire ancien et moderne, although work didn't begin until a commission was granted in 1769. I can't locate the date that the commission was given, but if you read French, this document might be a good starting point for more research. 

I think you are forgetting that the inflation rate during WWI was staggering. The consumer price index at the end of the war was extremely high, and the deflation that you are referring to can be seen as more of a adjustment in pricing back toward pre-war levels. In fact the CPI was relatively flat through the 20s as a 10 year moving average: 

This may be referring to The Magyar Struggle, from Neue Rheinische Zeitung No. 194, January 13, 1849 (emphasis mine): 

...it seems like this has been repeated in quite a few other secondary sources in a context of advocating genocide. I'll defer judgment of whether this was taken out of context to the reader. 

In 1928, equity prices were booming due to the increase in the money supply, and the Federal Reserve feared that this was a speculative bubble driven by low interest rates. The Fed's action was intended to encourage people to move money from investing in the stock market toward bank savings in an effort to stabilize the economy, not to borrow. 

Such concern likely existed, and there is evidence of some cursory discussion to that effect during the proceedings of the Continental Congress. The rationale for creating a federal district with sole jurisdiction of the Congress was probably laid out best (among the surviving documents) by James Madison: 

It arrived in Havana with the general on board 2 days later, again as reported by the New York Times on June 4th: 

This was a variation of the F.N. model. 1910 that was commissioned by the Yugoslavian military in the inter-war period with 60,000 ordered with both general issue and "officer" markings. Note, the Wikipedia article is horribly referenced, but you should be able to confirm this in Anthony Vanderlinden's book FN Browning Pistols: Side-Arms That Shaped World History as several other sites refer to it (I don't have a copy so can't verify this). 

First of all, the name of the Muslim-Turkish state that defeated Byzantine army in the 11th century at Manzikert was Great Seljuk Empire. As its name mentioned, though a relatively short lived one, it was indeed a great empire that extends from Central Asia to Egypt. Their Sultans, most governors and a significant part of their population were Oghuz Turks, also called as Turkmens-same people who founded Ottoman Empire. Secondly, The Empire represented an advanced civilization of its time and its army was not a mere raiding force that only seeks plunder. They were trying to find a new land to settle, and to serve Islam while doing so. For these reasons they wisely chose Anatolia and achieved their goal by implementing a sound grand strategy after years of struggle. That's the main reason behind migration of many tribes of Oghuz Turks, which were not too few in numbers, to Anatolia. As experienced by all other empires, Seljuks eventually had been mixed up with many other people they conquered, though generally in small numbers, including other Turkic people, Arabs, Byzantines, Kurds... and especially Persians. This might had been caused a shift in internal power balance as we know that in their last years the langauge that was spoken among the elite was Persian. Returning to the point, most of them were still considering themselves as Oghuz Turks and were slightly slanted eyed like Asian people. Also there was a population boom in Anatolia following the Mongol invasion of 13th century, bringing many (millions?) people to Anatolia and many of them were Oghuz Turks. There were also other Turkish and smaller number of non Turkish tribes and eventually they were all merged together in one pot. About genetics, I am not an expert but as far as I know, some genes that cause someone having Asian appearance are not of dominant type. Additionally, environmental factors have some effects over genes (depression for example) to some extent, but I cannot prove whether these factors played a major role on the issue we are discussing or not. Also, until today (especially in Ottoman era) there have been many more mixings with other nations' gene pools including European ones. As a last note, no single race has just one fenotype-it is true both for today and for the past. Even in small portions, there are people in a race that express a different fenotype than remaining majority. This internal differences might also have contributed in appearance of the today's Turks. So, there is little wonder about the appearance of modern day Turkish people. 

Though this was not asked in the question, I would like to start with the basics just to explain that they were not slaves at all. For the first half of the Ottoman Empire's lifetime, the devşirme system worked well and very effectively. A boy who was picked by an official to become a part of the Ottoman elites was getting a first class education and could serve in almost every position -janissary, vizier, architect, naval officer... Of course, for him there was no way to become the Sultan. With this little exception, he could serve in anywhere. And the highest position he could get was Grand Vizier -second to only Sultan himself. Probably the most important figure among devşirme Grand Viziers is Sokollu Mehmed Pasha. He was born around 1506 and was Grand Vizier between 1565-1579, during which he served three different Sultans, including Suleiman I. He is well known -for lots of things, but especially- for his answer to Venetian ambassador after the Battle of Lepanto (which Ottomans lost): 

Religion as a motivation for Armstrong's solo visit is very unlikely. Armstrong was actually the 2nd U.S. Astronaut that travelled to the Soviet Union - the first was Frank Borman, who arrived in Moscow on July 2nd, 1969 after being invited by the U.S.S.R. Institute for Soviet-American Relations.1 Borman was among the more religious of the Apollo astronauts, and the Soviets certainly can't have missed his reading of Genesis when Apollo 8 was orbiting the Moon on December 24, 1968. Like Borman, Armstrong was not invited by the Soviet government - his visit was arranged through the International Council of Scientific Unions' Committee on Space Research (COSPAR). Armstrong was part of a delegation of 32 American scientists and NASA officials2 and was ostensibly there to present a paper titled "Lunar Surface Exploration" at the 13th COSPAR conference in Leningrad May 20th through May 29th, 1970 (which he also subsequently presented at a conference in Berlin the next year).3 The official Soviet government response to his visit was a luke-warm, and it took 5 days after his arrival to get permission to visit the Kremlin.4 Most likely, Armstrong's visit was a natural result of the attempts of the heads of both the U.S. and Soviet scientific communities to develop a more cooperative relationship than had characterized the early space race. Several months prior to Armstrong's trip to Leningrad, Thomas O. Paine (Administer of NASA at the time) had sent his counterpart at the Soviet Academy of Sciences Mstislav Keldysh a copy of two reports on the possibility of creating a more cooperative relationship between the two agencies. 

The Wikipedia page basically summarizes the entire book into two sentences. It's worth the read and short enough not to be much of a time commitment. 

Reprisal indeed sank in a storm, but there seems to be some dispute as to whether it was on October 1st or November 1st. This is one of the surviving contemporary reports from an "Extract of a letter from the gentleman of this place, dated at Bourdeaux, November 20, 1777".1 

Keep in mind that Stephens' books were the among the first western studies of Mayan sites and the first to gain wide circulation. On top of that, Stephens is quite a talented writer and writes in the style of similar works in during the period. Given that (as you point out) most earlier books and references had been systematically destroyed, these books would have been about the only point of reference to draw from. The books themselves read more like travel literature or real-life adventure than an anthropological or archaeological study - he was out to sell books and doesn't hide the fact, for example: 

The Hunt and Lipo Late Arrival Hypothesis You can get a little better understanding of the hypothesis put forward in the article linked to in the question in this Terry Hunt's 2006 paper in American Scientist3. Much of the hypothesis put forward in The Statues That Walked stems from the conclusion that Hunt puts forward in that paper - that the settlement of Easter Island occurred much later than previously claimed (this effects population growth estimates and rate of deforestation). This claim is rejected (with the requisite amount of academic politeness) by quite a few others in the field based on what they see as flaws in Hunt's methodology. Bahn and Flenley write in their broadside rebuttal of the book that; 

It isn't clear who the author of the letter is, but Jan II Kazimierz may be a good candidate. Regardless, it appears to have been written the day before Kraków capitulated as it includes an intercept from Gustav:
