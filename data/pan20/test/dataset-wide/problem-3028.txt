I used to believe that after the establishment of the Commonwealth of Poland and Lithuania, the capital was moved to Warsaw to be closer to the center of the combined country. While they're not wrong, the other answers to this effect may overlook a key factor. Its true that the Sejm or Parliament of the country began meeting in Warsaw as early as 1529, and permanently in beginning in 1569, the year the Commonwealth was established, as per this History of Warsaw. But the gist of the question was why the capital was moved in 1595 and not in 1569 or some other year. And I found the answer somewhat surprising: Warsaw as a key point in the three way balance of power between Poland, Lithuania, and Sweden. In 1595, the Polish king was Sigismund III, the son of the King Sweden, and his Queen, Catherine Jagellion, of the Lithuanian royal family. As such, he was a logical choice for "election" to king of Poland. He was also supposed to inherit the Swedish crown, meaning that he would be able to rule both Sweden and Poland in a "personal union." Unfortunately, Sweden would not allow Sigismund to ascend to the Swedish throne because he was a Catholic. So Sweden "disinherited" him and gave the throne to a cousin. In this context, Warsaw was a much better place for Sigismund to contest the Swedish throne than Krakow (even though he lost); no previous Polish king had attached this kind of importance to Warsaw. One earlier king left the Polish throne to become the king of France; others were more oriented to the southern part of the country. In the 17th and early 18th century wars against Sweden, Warsaw, which was defended by the Lithuanians, was useful as a "straw" capital that absorbed Swedish power, while Krakow remained a de facto "second" capital when Warsaw was occupied, and formed a focal point for the resurgence of Polish power. This formula didn't work in the 18th century because Austria and Prussian "amputated" Krakow and Gdansk, two important Polish cities in the first partition, leaving her to weak to resist the second and third partitions. 

I can think of several reasons. 1) Temporal proximity to World War II. As Korvin pointed out, World War I was named (retroactively) with reference to the war that took place 20-30 years later. The Seven Years' War was over 200 years earlier, not associated in people's minds with World War II. If you take the argument that the Seven Years' War should have been "World War I," then World War I would have been "World War II" and World War II would have been "World War III." 2) Lesser geographical reach. The Seven Years' War involved Europe, North America, and India, about half the world. The "World Wars" involved these plus East Asia (the more populous part), Australia, Africa, and tangentially, South America (as suppliers of goods to North America and Europe, not as fighters). 3) The magnitude of the conflict. World War II cost 50-80 million lives, depending on the estimate. World War I cost about 20 million lives. The Seven Years' War, closer to 1 million, an order of magnitude lower. This is true, even adjusting for the differences in World population; 1750 population was about 1/3 of 1950 population. 

There are more members of many ethnic backgrounds in the U.S. than in their "home" countries. That is true not only of Jews but of Irish, British, and Germans (less so of southern and eastern Europeans). There are several reasons. 1) America was the "natural" place of emigration for people suffering from religious persecution. That applied to e.g. English and Irish Catholics, to a lesser extent, French, Italian, or Polish Protestants. Jews were members of "the other" religion in just about every country. 2) America was more favorably disposed toward producing children than Europe. In much of Europe, a child was another mouth to feed. In America, with its vast open spaces, a child represented another "pair of hands" on the farm, or in the case of Jews, in the "family business," (garments, retailing, etc.). According to Adam Smith (Wealth of Nations) [a widow] "who in Europe would have so little chance of a second husband, is courted there [America] as some sort of a fortune." 3) If persecuted in European country X, Jews had the choice of leaving for European country Y (nearby) or America (further away). Many feared that Y would eventually contain as much persecution as X, and opted for America. 4) Europe, the original "homeland" for Jews, mostly became a very inhospitable place in the 1930s and 1940s. A new "homeland" had not yet been established in the Holy Land, so the logical "landing place" for some very talented people was America. These included Albert Einstein, Lise Meitner, Enrico Fermi, etc. 

A lot had to do with King John of England. He was, of course, the King who signed the Magna Carta with his nobles in 1215, a year before his death. This occurred because of King John's misadventures trying to rule both England and part of modern France, and the resulting difficulties he had with his (English) nobles (including clergymen). The Magna Carta went far beyond e.g. the 14th century Golden Bull of the Holy Roman Empire (which guaranteed noble and church representation in government). The Magna Carta protected nobles personally, not just governmentally, against arbitrary taxation and feudal levies, and illegal imprisonment and sentencing without trial by jury. On the other hand, the Golden Bull of Hungary in the 13th century perhaps gave too much freedom and power to the nobles. This protected the nobles against the king or queen, but allowed them to oppress the common people. By accident or otherwise, King John, whatever his other faults, managed to strike just the right balance, as discussed in the next paragraph. Ironically, King John championed the cause of (free) "common" men against the nobles. Some of his policies against the nobles were a milder version of the "Reductions" (of noble land and power) undertaken successfully by Swedish kings in the 17th and 18th centuries. John also made it possible for "freemen" to sue the nobles and win, setting important precedents in "case" law from cases that he personally decided. ("The enemy of my enemy is my friend.") Thus, he offered common people a measure of protection from nobles (unlike the case in e.g. France) even as his signature on the Magna Carta put limits on his own royal power vis-a-vis the nobles. The Magna Carta was reaffirmed, if modified, during the reign of his infant son Henry III, and it is this "modified" form that has remained in force. King John started his family late in life, which may have offered another important advantage to the nobles. 

In the Battle of France, the Allies and Germans had roughly equal number of divisions and troops, and the Allies actually had more artillery and tanks. But the one area where the Germans had a clear superiority was airpower, with roughly a two to one edge. Much has been made of the superiority of the German Blitzkrieg tactics, and the skill of the outflanking movement through the Ardennes, across the Meuse, and to the coast. It's true that the Germans used their (fewer) tanks far better than the Allies. But could these successes (and the failure of Allied countermeasures) be at least partly attributable to German air superiority? (And apparently, German air superiority was a decisive factor against superior numbers of Soviet men, tanks, and artillery in 1941.) I've played a number of board games regarding France 1940 where "tactics" largely cancel out, but the one thing that stands out is the superior German airpower. Has any historian(s) made the point that superior airpower, was the decisive (not merely contributing) factor and sina qua non to the German victory in France in 1940? 

Yes, if you take into account "fighting retreats." Perhaps the most famous ones come from the Korean War, one of America's less successful wars. The battle of Chosin Reservoir in Korea was widely considered a retreat by the U.S. 1st Marine Division and 7th Infantry Division. This was even though the Marine Commander, General Oliver P. Smith put a brave face on it by saying something like, "Gentlemen, we are not retreating. We are attacking in a new direction." Here is a list of Congressional Medal of Honor Recipients that include at least three officers of that retreat, Lt. Col. Don Faith (of the 7th infantry), and Captain William Barber and Sgt. Robert Kennemore (1st Marine). Also, Major General William Dean commanding officer of the 24th Division during the early days, whose "fighting retreat" (which he personally led, wielding a bazooka and destroying an enemy tank), bought enough time for the rest of the U.N. forces to arrive. 

That was true in the "early days" (basically the days of the Roman Republic). At that time, "Rome," (basically central Italy), was beset by Greek outposts (of so-called Magna Graecia) in southern Italy (as far north as modern Naples, at one time), Tarentum, and the Italian "boot." Also Carthaginian outposts in Lilybaem (Sicily), Caralis (Sardinia). And Carthage and its allies in North Africa weren't that far away. During the time of the Carthagian threat, a Roman Senator, Cato the Elder repeatedly exhorted his country to destroy Carthage: Carthago delenda est By the end of the Second Punic War, Rome had neutralized the Carthaginian and Magna Graecia threats. They still had to worry about the balance of power in Greece itself, and whether the Macedonians, the Selucids, or the two in combination might threaten Italy from across the Adriatic. But four successful Macedonian wars (and one against the Selucids) took care of that threat. Maybe there was a further threat from the Celts (Rome's ancient enemy) in Milan, and in Gaul. But Caesar's conquest of Gaul, and the earlier conquest of Spain and Milan had neutralized that threat. By the time of the Caesars, Julius and Augustus, Rome had neutralized the immediate threats. It had no real need to expand further into Britain, Germany, or much beyond the shores of the eastern Mediterranean. 

Because the Roman infantry developed a "two wave" attack structure. The phalanxes used long spears, whose advantage was that they could kill enemies at "long range" (15-20 feet). So the Romans broke up their attack into two stages. The first part was with "pilum" (throwing spears), which were launched from 50-60 feet away, and had a greater range than long spears, plus momentum. Put another way, the Romans had the advantage of drawing the "first blood." The the second part of the attack was "close up" with thrusting swords. These were shorter than spears but had the advantage of being more maneuverable. Their main disadvantage against spears was that an array of long spears could hold off a sword attack. But this array was broken up by the pilum attack, giving the greater maneuverability of swords a decisive advantage. 

Ethnic Turks first embraced Islam when they met the expanding Arab empire in modern day Iran (and slightly to the north and east). This was where the Turks had settled, and the Arabs were conquering in the late seventh, and eight centuries A.D. The Arabs feared Turkish military prowess more than that of the longer-term "locals," and offered economic and social inducements (e.g. better education) to the Turks to support them. Part of the "package" was the Islamic religion. By the turn of the Millenium, Arab power waned, leaving a power vacuum for the Turks to move into. These newly Islamacized Turks moved west across Iraq, into the eastern part of modern day Turkey. Around 1200 A.D. the even fiercer Mongols accelerated the process by chasing the Turks out of Iran, and into Turkey. Short answer (in reverse order of the questions asked): The Turks were "Islamized" by the rising Arab powers when they met in Iran, and then when Arab power waned, they migrated into modern Turkey, (conquering the local Byzantine empire), making that part of the world Islamic.
