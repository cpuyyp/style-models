On the other hand, advice to homeowners from Crimestoppers (an official English crime prevention organisation) from an ex-burglar said 

The answer is likely to be no, the customer cannot specify the form of the change. Effectively you ended up in the position that you (or the owner of the gas station) owed the customer $19. So long as you provided legal tender of $19, that would be enough to extinguish the debt so long as you had not previously agreed anything else with the customer or had a sign saying what would happen. In some places there are specifications on what combinations are and are not legal tender (such as coins in the UK) but not as far as I am aware in the USA. In some locations there are specifications on change, such as a Madrid rule that taxi drivers must be able to provide change up to 20 euros but not necessarily higher. Sometimes these laws create a nonsense, leading to the old sign saying "Postmasters are neither bound to give change nor authorised to demand it." By taking the pre-payment you seem to have implicitly agreed to provide change for any unused amount, presumably up to the $50. But in the absence of anything else either by law or contract, you could provide the change in whatever form you wished. All that being said, you should remember that the customer is always right even when they are wrong. That is a matter of marketing rather than law. 

The rest of the 500+ page report goes into more detail, for example on second earners, or families with children, or different wage levels. On page 548, among the limitations of the report, it says 

There are change in time perception is called Tachypsychia. Causes include the stress-related Catecholamine hormones, especially Epinephrine (adrenaline). This is a stimulant, increasing heart rate and blood pressure, and so increasing alertness as well as strength and pain thresholds It has negative effects: for example in pages 16-19 of a UK Government training manual: 

In the United States, The King's Speech was censored by the distributor after the Oscars to remove f-words so as to obtain a different rating. Other films have seen different editions, with descriptions such as "the Director's Cut". Brotherhood of the Wolf is an example of this, at least for DVD, so perhaps the cinema discovered this and changed the edition it was showing. 

The first part of the quotation, namely "True religion affords government its surest support" is genuine. It is repeating a statement made to Washington by the Synod of the Dutch Reformed Church in North America in 1789. Washington's reply included: 

But that was not the cost of the Channel Tunnel Rail Link (now called High Speed 1). That cost has been estimated at almost £6 billion, reported here as £5 billion for the link and £800 million for the revamped station at St Pancras in London. I have no idea what the cost of Wi-Fi on the trains would have been, but £600,000 (about US$1 million) seems more plausible than £600. 

There is heavy pollution in some cities in the developing world. Delhi and Beijing are famous examples, but there are many more, and more people are affected than ever before because of population growth and urbanisation. But the opposite is true in cities in the developed world. The UK graph you show goes back to 1970. But the situation in London was much worse in the 1950s (the Great Smog of December 1952 is widely known though a short-term weather pattern made things much worse) and worse still back in 1900. Take this chart from Our World in Data showing particulates in London over the longer term; it also shows Delhi is recently at levels London saw before WWII And it is not just London. Another famous example for pollution is Los Angeles. The following chart from EOS Earth & Space Science News - Urbanization and Air Pollution: Then and Now shows ozone and some other pollutants falling from the start of the graph in the 1960s, though often still above modern standards set more to drive further improvement than because there is a safe level of pollution 

So it was not a freedom granted to anybody, but a wartime instruction to the City authorities soon after the Battle of Shrewsbury, similar to a selective curfew. In any case, within five years the citizens of Chester elected a Welsh mayor, John Ewloe, who did not arrest or execute himself. 

No - the BBC apparently did edit an interview, twice, but seems not to have added words. The interviewee originally both used the words "chemical attack" and used the word "napalm"; the BBC using different parts of the same interview in different broadcasts You can read Ofcom's investigation into RT (not into the BBC) at $URL$ (pages 22-48) in which RT/TV-Novosti told Ofcom that the original interview with Dr Rola Hallam had

Secular came into English through the Catholic church, where secular clergy were those priests and deacons not subject to a monastic rule (regulum in Latin, hence monks were regular clergy). The secular clergy were those out in the world. In education in 19th century Britain and its colonies, most schools were attached to religious institutions such as the Anglican and Catholic churches, causing problems for non-conformist Protestants and their children, as well as raising issue about sectarianism. When the State decided to make education compulsory and to provide schools where there were gaps, such as in the Elementary Education Act 1870 in England, the aim was to make schools which were not based on or controlled by a denomination and where there was no religious test for entry. There was provision for religious instruction and services, but it was separate from the rest of the timetable and a relatively small part of the timetable. The 1880 New South Wales law looks very similar and probably had the same intent. 

Plants have evolved various defence mechanisms including antiseptic, antibiotic and antifungal components. Some of these are collected in so-called "essential oils" and these oils can certainly have an impact. Perhaps the best known is tea tree oil. Some essential oils are toxic in high concentrations and some others seem merely to smell nice. As for Thieves essential oil, which seems to be a mixture of Clove, Lemon, Cinnamon Bark, Eucalyptus and Rosemary, the commercial website points a single published study of this particular mixture, in 1998 in the Journal of Essential Oil Research which does show some impact but does not seem to imply it is a cure-all. There is rather more in other publications on the individual components. As I said in a comment, the Thieves website has a disclaimer 

Congressional net worth is not up nearly 3700%. It is not claimed in the video you link to and it is not claimed by the Center for Responsive Politics. Indeed this chart from the CPR suggests that average net wealth in the Senate has been fairly stable and in the House has risen slightly. The video suggests (around 1:15) 223 out of 535 members of Congress saw their net wealth increase, suggesting more than half did not. So where does the 3700% number come from? It seems to be this list where one particular congressman saw his net worth increase from $47,503 to $1,790,508. That is partly caused by his low starting point but he still has less than the average by some way. Some others saw their net worth go from positive to negative, but that is not so outrageous. So the answer is that the video and your headline question are being selective. Some members of Congress get richer, some get poorer. Concentrate on the former and you get something to shout about. A different issue is that on average members of Congress are much richer than the rest of the population. For some, this might raise questions about how representative they are; for other that is irrelevant in a democracy where voters can choose. 

This looks like selective statistics. The GAO report can be read by anyone. The $16 trillion can be found in Table 8 (page 131 of report, 144 of pdf). This falls to $1.1 trillion in Table 9 (page 132/3 of report, 145/6 of pdf) if you adjust for term length (e.g. borrowing $1 twelve times for a month is treated the same as borrowing $1 for a year rather than as borrowing $12). Those two tables are only part of the story. A better table is the summary (page 4 of the pdf) which covers more types of transactions and their peak amounts but is still way below $16 trillion. That too is only part of the story: for example FRB-NY agreed to lend to Citigroup against losses between $56.2 billion and $300 billion, but in the event never did. How would this potential liability that was never called be treated? In the end you need to read the report. 

That study was published in Germany in 2003. As Nate Eldridge says, the reference is "Time to pregnancy: results of the German prospective study and impact on the management of infertility"; C. Gnoth, D. Godehardt, E. Godehardt, P. Frank‐Herrmann, G. Freundl. Human Reproduction, Volume 18, Issue 9, 1 September 2003, Pages 1959–1966, doi.org/10.1093/humrep/deg366. Another study published in 2003 with data from China was: Wang X, Chen C, Wang L, Chen D, Guang W, et al. (2003) "Conception, early pregnancy loss, and time to clinical pregnancy: a population-based prospective study." Fertil Steril 79: 577–584. doi.org/10.1016/S0015-0282(02)04694-0 The Chinese study does not seem to be open access but states in its abstract
