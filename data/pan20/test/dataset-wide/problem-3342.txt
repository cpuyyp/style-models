A relatively straightforward research question in the study of dead languages is of the form: "We have root XYZ that means A in context P and B in context Q. How can we generalise A and B to arrive at a general meaning for XYZ?" The question can be approached both from a diachronic perspective ("How did meanings A and B derive from older, more general meaning C?") and from a synchronic perspective ("What do A and B have in common, and what aspects characterise both?"). An example of a diachronic approach would be Gluck (1976). The root lḥm in Hebrew and in the Semitic languages. OTSWA (19), pp. 41–43. An example of a synchronic approach would be Kotzé (2016). Comments on the Uses and Meanings of אין in the Masoretic Text of the Hebrew Bible: Revisiting Vriezen. Hebrew Studies (57), pp. 17–38. How would I call such a study, particularly one with a synchronic approach? 

It is a ב (beth). The thing above it that made you think of a lamed is a cholem (the vowel sign), and it has a dagesh in the middle. This is a masculine plural participle of the root בטח "to trust", i.e. "those who trust" (if used as a noun). This word is for instance used in Jeremiah 46:25: 

For biblical Hebrew there is the Semantic Dictionary of Biblical Hebrew which may give you some inspiration. 

G is called G for the German Grundstamme. D is called D because of Doubling of the middle radical (/qatal/ > /qittel/). C is called C for Causativity. It is also called Š sometimes which better reflects phonology (although in Hebrew the marking consonant became /h/). Dt is often called tD because the /t/ became a prefix rather than an infix elsewhere. Verbal plurality can be of subject, object or action, e.g. "they broke the glass" in G becomes "they shattered the glass (in many pieces) in D via object plurality, or "they repeatedly broke the glass" (action plurality) or "they all broke the glass" (subject plurality). Causativity is e.g. to cause to be seen, i.e. "to reveal". Thus you see that these distinctions are in English covered by lexicon rather than grammar (i.e., there are different verbs for different Aktionsarts, "broke"-"shattered" and "see"-"reveal"). Besides this nice symmetric system there was an N-stem, the original semantics of which are still debated but which probably had to do something with middle voice. In Central Semitic, "internal passives" are developed for the three core stems G, D and C. In Arabic grammar these are usually not treated as separate stems, but in Hebrew and other languages they are: 

All of these are ungrammatical which is strong evidence that these that phrases are not noun phrases. 

BEFORE (in the limited sense of a temporal comparison) is one of the Semantic Primes of the Natural Semantic Metalanguage. Though NSM researchers have not considered every language in existence, they have studied languages from every large family, so I'd consider this decent evidence that this is something every language will have. Note that the primes may be represent by affixes or phrases rather than just single words. 

The morpheme would probably be best described as a case suffix. In natural languages the oblique case often has the meaning of concerning/regarding, but it also has other meanings. If you wanted a label purely for this meaning I think you'll need to make one up. One option would be regardive. I'd wonder though if you're really being tied too much to the English. Notice that in your first example the case marks a relation between two nouns, but in the second it marks a relation with the verb. Languages with productive case will have verbs which require their arguments to be in particular cases, just as many English verbs require their arguments to be prepositional phrases. Would it be possible to say "1SG.FUT-tell you-DAT tooth"? Without that contrast the case marker is actually almost semantically empty. That doesn't mean you shouldn't do it, because many languages do, but it just seems to me that the only reason the suffix is there is because the English translation would use the word 'about', not because it necessarily makes language-internal sense. The English word tell is really polysemous and has two meanings: tell to and tell about/of. That's why it almost always requires one of those prepositions. In your constructed language there's no reason why tell should also have those two meanings - it would probably be more natural to have two verbs. If you did that then you wouldn't need the suffix. And if you did that then you could reconsider what the suffix actually means: does it mean a joke with dogs in it? If so then one of the spatial cases would be very appropriate. Just as in natural languages, physical relations can be extended to metaphorical relations in conlangs too. Instead of basing it on English prepositions I'd encourage you to think about basing it on thematic relations. Your conlang will be less Englishy if your cases are based on those relations rather than translations from English. 

Floating quantifiers are quantifiers that can move away from the corresponding noun, such as "each" in "The boys hit each other" where it modifies "The boys". I am interested in prepositions in these bipartite reciprocal constructions, as in "They followed each others onto the stage" or "They waited for each other." These constructions are comparable to "They waited, each for the other." In this last example, the preposition is near its complement "the other", but in the earlier examples it is not. Is there a term for these kind of "floating prepositions"? This term does not yield any results on Google Scholar. 

Note that from the definition follows that the distance between entirely unrelated sets is 1 (not ∞ as you may expect) which explains the many "perfect matches" with a distance measure of 1. A perfect match in fact has a distance of 0 (which only happens when the sets are identical). 

Although I haven't heard of the term "degrees of passive/active" before, they are almost certainly talking about the verbal stems. This is a concept indeed alien to Western European (or broader) but common to all Semitic languages. The core idea is that the stems differentiate voice and Aktionsart. In an earlier stage of the language (pre-1000 BCE) there must have been ten verbal stems, nine of which fit into a 3x3 grid of voice and Aktionsart: 

A good diachronic overview paper with many references is Gzella, H. 2009. 'Voice in Classical Hebrew against Its Semitic Background', Orientalia 78(3), pp. 292–325. 

This is almost certainly done with LaTeX, or one of its friends, and the tikz-qtree package. It is an improvement of the qtree package with nicer node placement. If you are not familiar with LaTeX, and want to learn more, this Wikibook might help (link is to the page about linguistics, but the book is in general about LaTeX). Both tikz-qtree and qtree have a quite extensive manual. Below is LaTeX code using the tikz-qtree package to draw your tree. The only difference with the original seems to be that the bar over the T and the v is less bold. Perhaps this was done with something like this, but I cannot get it to look exactly the same. 

Each of these categories will have dozens of options when you look at all the world's languages, though an individual language will usually only have a few, if it marks the category at all. The things you list in your question are just some of the inflections you'll see, and some of them wouldn't even normally be considered to be inflections, as they are derivational! 

helps is definitely a verb - the /-s/ suffix is the third person present tense agreement marker. I drew the tree with an internal sentence, but it might also be called an Inflection Phrase or a Tense Phrase. There's little consensus on the syntactic categories. (You can make trees like this easily at $URL$ 

Of course, it is also often said that Japanese does have pronouns. What arguments are used to answer this question? Does it stem from a lack of agreement over how to define a pronoun? If so, under which definitions does Japanese have and not have pronouns? 

This will depend on both the language you are analysing and your analytical framework, but in most cases both nouns and pronouns could be categorised as a subcategory of the nominals. Other subcategories of the nominals include (in some languages) proper names, participles, adjectives, and co-referencing affixes/clitics. The nominals could also be called substantives. Nouns and verbs are the two arch-categories of the open word classes. If a word can take morphology such as case, gender or number, then it will usually be analysed as a nominal. The different nominal subcategories will have different restrictions on which morphology they can take. Or if there is no difference, then it can be argued that what would be two word classes in one language are actually one word class in another. The adjectives are the classic example of a word class that can be either a pure nominal, a pure verb, a pure independent category, or something in between. 

While the others are correct that the normal description is that participles are "verbal adjectives" (an unhelpful and almost meaningless explanation in my opinion), it is worth noting that participles can also be used substantivally, i.e., as a nominal in its own right. So in Greek ὁ λεγων means 'the one who is speaking' or 'the speaking one', and the same happens in English with gerunds like the happening. We should expect this across languages all around the world. There are two primary word classes: nouns and verbs; generally the more time-stable and the more time-variable. Some languages have distinct modifier classes like adjectives and adverbs, but many do not, with those modifiers being formally in the noun or verb class. Word derivation can change the class of words. Participles and infinitives are two ways in which the variability of a verb is decreased or removed, so that a verb which meant an action gets turned into a word which conveys the idea of the action. The idea of an action is then used as a modifier for either a noun or a verb, but just as with other modifiers, it can then also be used by itself as a nominal in its own right. 

I often hear people mention in passing that grammatical features are more reliable than lexical features in diachronic research, specifically when detecting pseudepigraphs, because it is relatively easy to fake old lexicon but difficult to fake old grammar (as is evidenced anecdotally by people imitating old English but mixing "thee", "thou" and "thy"). If I were to mention this in my paper, who should I cite? Where can I read more about this hypothesis? Has there been any statistical analysis on it? 

You are implementing the Jaccard coefficient whereas the library has the Jaccard distance. The coefficient tells how related two sets are (it is high when they are similar), whereas the distance does the opposite; it is low when they are similar. In fact, they are each other's complement, i.e. d = 1-c and c = 1-d. This is also explained on the Wikipedia article you linked: 

An older version of this answer just used the qtree package (instead of tikz-qtree) and draws something that looks like your tree. The only trick we need is to use and , because otherwise the bar over the T is touched by the edge. The differences with the original: 

This system developed differently in different languages. I cannot comment on the situation in Arabic (which as far as I can see from Wikipedia must also have developed the new L stem) because I don't know enough about it. In (Biblical) Hebrew, there was the issue that Gt, Gp and N both indicate relatively rare non-active voice unmarked for Aktionsart. This leads to the dropping of Gt and to a large extent that of Gp as well, whereas N takes on passive meanings and Dt takes over reflexive voice unmarked for Aktionsart. Also, Ct is almost not attested in Biblical Hebrew and as far as I know does not exist in Modern Hebrew because reflexive causativity is so rare. Thus in Hebrew the situation has become far less symmetric than it once was. On the other hand, in Syriac, the function of the passives was taken over by participles and the N disappeared, leading to a highly symmetric system of only 6 stems (in fact, like the original table above). After this long detour I would still like to comment on the terminology of "degrees of passive/active". I'm sure that the author had his reasons for this term, but it doesn't seem to be accurate: it covers only one dimension of the system (voice) but neglects the other (Aktionsart). Thus, the verbal stems G, D and C all indicate active voice (the same "degree of passive/active"), whereas Gt/Dt/Ct all indicate reflexivity and Gp/Dp/Cp all indicate passive voice. (Only in Hebrew the system is more complicated, because N can indicate both middle and passive voice, thus being in between degrees). Lastly, for your convenience a table of the more common names of the stems in language-specific grammars: 

It doesn't matter what proportion of the time you'll hit one of these problems - to ensure that you aren't you'll need to check a good English dictionary every single time. So it won't end up helping you any more than just checking a good English dictionary to start with would help! Learn other languages, but do so for their own sake, not to pretend it will help your English. 

My interpretation would be that the -miş suffix marks both inferential evidentiality and perfective aspect. It primarily contrasts with the perfective suffix -di. If you don't want the perfective aspect or its implied past tense, then you can use one of the compound sufixes to override the perfective part of -miş. 

Rather than propose that it has a different structure I think it's best to say that it has the same structure: two clauses. 

Most recently developed orthographies are phonemically straight forward - they become less ideal as time goes on and the spoken language goes under sound shifts, but the written language doesn't. Most of the languages SIL has worked with did not have an orthography before, so you'll be able to find many in their archive. 

So rather than using mathematical/logical symbols (∀, ¬, ⊃, ∄), symbols taken from natural language are used (ALL, NOT, SOME, IF). And rather than using the syntax of functions or following the order of operations, the syntax of natural language is used, following (in English for example) the normal order of SVO, adjective-noun etc. Whether this is a good idea, and whether it's successful is definitely still up for debate, but that's what the "Natural" means. 

The words themselves are of course not categories. They are however commonly considered to be the conventional grammaticalised means of conveying those categories. Many of them however have multiple senses, and they do not all convey modality in every sense. 

English doesn't have a "pluperfect tense", so it couldn't have come from anything. English has two tenses: past and non-past. It has a progressive aspect marker (-ing) and a perfect construction (have). The various "tenses" like the "pluperfect" just arise naturally from the various combinations of those elements. I'm not sure what the origin of the English perfect construction is, but in general, it is definitely true that grammatical features including tense change. For example, you can look at Wikipedia's summary of Old English verbs, which had distinct morphological forms for infinitives, subjunctives and imperatives, none of which exist now in Modern English.
