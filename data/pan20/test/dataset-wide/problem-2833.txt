I don't know of any philosophers who fit the criteria, largely because "metaphysical naturalism" implies a physical reductionism when it comes to mind, which leaves no room for free will. Thus, there are no ethical issues to be considered: "ought" reduces to "is". EDIT: Since the question has been reframed a bit, I'll attempt to flesh out my question in a slightly different direction. It seems, from reading between the lines, that the question is actually about the grounding of an ethics that does not rely on a supernatural agent (such as a deity.) This is actually quite different than specifying metaphysical naturalism, which is a much more constrained view. For example, Kantian ethics do not require reference to a deity, nor do Aristotelian ethics or Buddhist ethics; however, none of them insist that mind can be reduced to physical phenomena. The latter is an extreme position held by very few philosophers, and raises all kinds of problems, not the least of which is a nexus for free will-- if the mind is purely physico-mechanical, we are forced into a determinist position, and ethics becomes irrelevant. This latter argument is made quite eloquently by Raymond Tallis in his recent book, "Aping Mankind", which shows very effectively the limits of physical reductionism when it comes to minds. So: if you are looking for an ethics which is compatible with atheism, there are many to choose from. But if you are insisting on a metaphysics which is purely physical, there's no real need for ethics, as there are no persons to speak of: only so many atoms bouncing off each other in varying conglomerations. SECOND EDIT: To clarify: Cicero and Carneades are not, in my reading, physical reductionists. Although they reject supernatural agents, they do not reject human agency, and this agency is tied up in a conception of mind that allows mind to influence matter-- which violates physical reductionism. Physical reductionism is an extreme variant of non-supernatural metaphysics. There are a number of notable non-supernaturally-grounded ethical systems out there, but these all require an ethical agent who is capable of choice. This cannot be reconciled with physical reductionism, as there is no locus of choice-- how can a mechanical process make a free choice? Even those philosophers who claim to hold a reductionist position (like Penrose) get all hand-wavy when it comes down to these matters (i.e. quantum stuff). If one believes that the mental supervenes on the physical, then conscious decisions cannot be causative, but must simply be side-effects of physical objects following the laws of physics; one must either be a dualist, or an eliminativist (and argue that mental events do not exist at all.) Jaegwon Kim makes this case quite cogently. 

That being said, Neoplatonism is an Alexandrian tradition, and as such, is largely syncretic. The degree to which this syncretism permitted later Christian, Islamic and Jewish philosophers to appropriate Neoplatonist thought is a large reason for its ultimate influence. 

Quantum Physics doesn't disprove determinism. What Quantum Physics does do is significantly complicate the task of arguing for determinism. Put in the simplest possible terms, the Uncertainty Principle indicates that: 1) our observation of an event has a significant effect on the event, and 2) it is impossible for a single observation to observe all relevant properties of an event. This means that any argument for determinism can no longer have simple recourse to the notion of observation. So, when you say: 

But how would you definite "trying to survive" in this context? There are certainly physical phenomena which may appear to be self-preserving from the outside, but which are not generally considered to be living-- for example, a river will attempt to flow around any obstruction put in its way. Is a current of water alive? 

That's not a conflict; that's the state's raison d'etre. With the exception of a few libertarian anarchists, all philosophers operate from the premise that the state is going to "actively restrict the freedom/liberty of its citzens (at least temporarily)." As for the details of how much liberty can be restricted for what purpose, and by what ethical justification, there are as many different answers as their are political philosophers. You're going to have to narrow the question down quite a bit in order to get a more detailed reply. 

Sorry, but no. Nietzsche's aphoristic style may lead one to believe that each aphorism can be interpreted independently, but this is far from the case; in fact, one can usually find an aphorism arguing a contradictory position elsewhere in Nietzsche's oeuvre. If your goal is to understand Nietzsche's intentions, the aphorism must be contextualized within the larger arguments of the work it is drawn from, and the larger context of Nietzsche's project. If, on the other hand, the goal is not to understand Nietzsche's intentions, but rather, just to come up with a plausible sounding interpretation of a particular string of words, then your interpretation will suffice as well as any other; perhaps better (for you), since it is yours. 

The short answer here is that philosophy is not concerned with testable hypothesis and controlled observation; those matters are left to science. Philosophy is concerned, rather, with questions that cannot be answered through this process. 

A definition (in the mathematical context) is simply the granting of a new name. When we define pi to be the ratio of the circumference to the diameter of a circle, we are not making a claim of any kind; we're simply agreeing to use a given greek letter to substitute for a given notion. A proposition, on the other hand, attempts to add new information (by predication, etc.) EDIT: Since the question was updated to mention Kant's analytic/synthetic distinction, I thought I'd update my answer as well. Note that I said above "(in the mathematical context)"-- in mathematics, it is customary to draw a distinction between definitions and propositions. This distinction is not maintained the same way in Kantian (and post-Kantian) metaphysics; there, as you point out, a definition is a type of analytic proposition. Certain words are "terms of art" in more than one domain-- it is important to take these in the appropriate context, and avoid slippages between them. 

It has been about 30 years since I have read Fanon's The Wretched of the Earth, but I don't recall him as arguing that Nazism was the culminating point of the project of European colonialism. Could you provide a bit more of the argument? The passage that you quote makes a somewhat different argument: that the Nazi occupation of Europe possessed such strong similarities to the colonial occupation of the Third World, that the Third World countries should be entitled to the same reparations and restitution that were demanded by the countries occupied by the Nazis. In other words, if France is permitted to put the Nazi leaders on trial, and demand reparations and restitution, why can't Algeria make the same demands of France? 

Which brand is hardest to refute is going to depend on what epistemological standpoint one is arguing from, but I imagine that Pyrrho and Sextus Empiricus represent two of the most enduring proponents of skepticism; certainly, anyone attempting to "refute" skepticism would have to grapple with Agrippa's Trilemma. EDIT: Just to flesh out the link a bit-- Agrippa's Trilemma argues that all attempts at justification resolve to one of three cases: an infinite regression (e.g., we justify A by B, which is in turn justified by C, etc., with no end); a circular argument (e.g., we justify A by B, which is in turn justified by C, which is justified by A); or a set of unjustified axioms (we justify A by B, which is taken as axiomatic.) In other words: if treated skeptically, nothing can be satisfactorily justified; all attempts at foundation are ultimately either assumed, circular, or deferred. 

It would problematize the scientific method only for those cases where results are not repeatable through controlled observation. Most (if not all) mysterious quantum effects disappear at the level of everyday objects, so the odds of these kinds of things actually causing a practical problem for science as it is routinely practiced are vanishingly small. 

It's a false dilemma; nobody is required to choose to use exclusively one or the other. A serious study of philosophy is impossible without reading the primary texts. A reading of the primary texts is impossible without sufficient context, which is most easily acquired via secondary (or tertiary) texts. I have never heard of an undergraduate philosophy course that did not rely on a combination of the two. 

That's only correct if the universe is infinite and the configuration of the universe is driven purely by chance. There's still the possibility that the universe is finite, or that the universe if infinite, but ordered in a non-random manner. 

you instantly run into trouble, because we can't know every single variable that existed as a factor at any point in time (including the initial state) through any type of observation. 

There's not much more us guys here can offer, until you refine the question. Since you are asking about the nature of consciousness, and not bliss or existence, we can bracket those parts for now, which leaves us with: 

I'd argue this way, although I think a basic European History textbook or two will go a long way. (I'm in the same predicament in reverse; my studies of Buddhist philosophy have been hampered by my lack of knowledge of Asian history. Thomas McEvilley's book The Shape of Ancient Thought covers the connections between the Ancient Greek and Indian worlds quite nicely, I've found.) 

I understand that this is statistically unlikely to be useful to you, but for the sake of future Googlers: There is an excellent introduction to Spinoza, written by the Norwegian philosopher Arne Næss, entitled Det frie menneske. Unfortunately, it has not (yet) been translated into English. Except for that lamentable limitation, it is exactly what you are looking for: a guide to Spinoza's Ethics, its place in Spinoza's philosophy, and its relevance to contemporary readers, written in a clear, accessible manner, by a man who was a leading philosopher in his own right. It is one of the best entry-level introductions to any philosopher that I know. 

I don't think that anyone proposes that unicellular organisms are sentient; in fact, very few would suggest that plants are sentient. 

Speed limits. Seriously. Our entire system of government, and, in fact, every system of government in this history of mankind, has been predicated on the notion of suppressing some freedoms for the sake of efficiency/superior performance/what-have-you. That's the nature of the social contract. There are as many different ways of framing this "problem" as there are different philosophers; for a more detailed response you're going to have to narrow down the problem a bit.
