Where logic is introduced. But this thought, this picture of the facts, is not a proposition. The picture I have of green grass is not the same as the proposition that 'grass is green', which he points out in: 

Its both; that is there is a theoretic side; and an experimental side. In the usual reading of mathematical logic, its the theory that came first; I think one can say justifiably, that in the future it will be the second that will be increasingly important. With a flexible enough language, one could envisage some/most/all proofs to be automatically checked - which takes, at least some of the burden off peer-checking; for example, there is a proof, in Agda of the simple homotopy properties of a circle; but this is because, the language which is a variant of homotopy logic - at least conjecturally. 

I think its a reasonable criteria; so long one is not wedded to it. The Atomic Theory was revived in the 16th C by Gassendi and others like Liebniz, Descarte and Newton; it wasn't falsifiable then but still proved useful; and now when it is falsified - in the strict sense - it still proves useful. 

Nietszche was brought up in a pious household, his father was the local pastor. In his first year at university he won the preaching prize. Being the man that he is - would he have not dared to compete with the great renunciate Christ himself? One could then suppose his rejection of Christianity came as a great release. However to classify him as a straight-forward athiest is to reduce the complexity of his religious thinking - it is an act of appropriation by those who have come after him, as he himself wrote: 

Principles, or arche is what Aristotle in line with his predecessors take as the principles by which Nature is understood (this is to be contrasted with his own concept, which is nature or entelechy). Some are prior to others; so there are the simplest such, in that they cannot be reduced to any more basic; he says that there is more than one and less than three. 

You can point to Chrysippus and say he existed at some point (where you use a tensed notion of existence). 

In post-colonial and marxist theory one often comes across the word Imperial. What is the meaning of this word? How does it differ from say a monarchy? Are there in fact several kinds of Imperialism? Does classical political theory in the tradition of Locke use this word? 

Formal systems are creative constructs by humans, they didn't boot themselves into existence; the main problem that they can't solve is understanding simply because we have no theory of consciousness that works; this problem Turing got around by simply saying imitativeness is enough, and so it has proven for most practical purposes. 

I recall growing up in a Britain which had nationalised rail, telephone, gas and electricity. I also recall reading somewhere that Roosevelts America viewed from where we are today would be seen as a socialist state. In neither of these two situations did the franchise contract. Given this empirical evidence, it doesn't seem particularly self-evident to me that socialism - in the sense that you use it - is neccesarily tied to undemocratic modes of government; though it was an argument used by Hayek, in the Road to Serfdom to say exactly that. There are other more subtle ways that the franchise can be 'taken' away without it being actually taken away; for example - voting can become ineffective and the population cynical or indifferent. 

Thus Sat is Being - at least linguistically. Heidegger term Sein, linguistically, the verb to be, is usually translated as Being, its present participle. Now, Aletheia (ἀλήθεια): 

It depends at the level you're working on; mathematics has a body of work that is precise: like the theory of groups or vector spaces. But before a notion becomes formalisable it is informal, vague and imprecise. For example the notion of space, can be traced back to Liebniz's analysis situ - a notion that has many different formal avatars: differential manifolds, sheaves, topological spaces and sites. Another example drawn from contemporary mathematics is the field of one element; a field being a certain mathematical structure where one can add, multiply or divide without limit; so the integers aren't a field, since one divided by two is a fraction and not an integer; the NLab go on to say: 

This Archimedes description of a limiting argument to find the area of a circle; it was Descartes introduction of coordinates that allowed Archimedes method, not to be more rigourous - it was already rigourous- but to generalise it. 

Kant divides cognition into two - the Understanding & the Intuition. Both are required to make knowledge possible: The understanding supplies concepts which makes the objects represented by the intuition intelligible. To make this clear - if I look at a chair without the Understanding all I see a mass of shapes and colours in space. It is pure sensation (intuition). By supplying the concept chair I make that pure sensation intelligible. On the other hand having the concept of chair without any sense-data is to render it contentless - it remains an abstraction. 

How does Buddhism explain the world? Was it created or eternally existant? Do they have creation myths? I'm asking this question, because what little & superficial knowledge I hve about Buddhism seems to be about the self, and not the world. At least as conventially understood. 

I find it difficult to see how a Transcendental Deduction of QM can be feasibly constructed or thought through given that Kants notion of space & time related not to space & time as its given objectively in a theory of physics, such as Newtons; but as it is given to us phenomenologically (or to be more accurate how we represent space and time to ourselves); its through this represention when thought through that we obtain Newtonian mechanics, or more recently QM. 

It suggests that Brouwer rejects the real line as a completed infinite object (a real object) and uses instead choice sequences to somehow test for points in an indeterminate, in some sense, real line. This explains the question in the title: The real line, or rather the continuum (because the real line refers to the classical construction by either Dedekind cuts or Cauchy sequences, and thinking of the continuum is a notional object before being axiomatised), when constructed (in the philosophy of constructivism), by rejecting completed infinities, cannot take the ideal points produced by the Dedekind cuts or Cauchy sequences as constructed, but somehow must work with, it appears with the sequences themselves. 

Certainly, the growth of capitalism has been spectacular - when Capital was first published Capitalism was restricted to North Europe whereas it is now the dominant economic mode globally; hence one can say that this prediction of Marxs has been verified; the question is his explanation sufficient. 

This is a very old problem, in Platos Parmenides, the young Socrates is asked to defend the theory of Forms by Parmenides, the elder statesman of Greek Philosophy if one is to judge by the enthusiasm he is recieved outside the walls of Athens. Socrates says he believes in the existence of the Forms of Justice and the Good, but when asked: 

It is in reference to this model of space and time that we derive the conventional notion of simultaneity: The time on the Moon flows at the same rate as it does here on Earth, and so it is a well posed question to ask whether some event occurs at the same time as another elsewhere. Leibniz main argument against this is that shifting everything in the universe by a uniform amount in space and time appears to give a different universe, but which he argues is in fact not. This indeterminancy suggests the relational view. (This indeterminancy, or gauge freedom, is used in Modern Field Theory to connect the symmetries of space & time with the usual conservation laws). Light and gravity posed a problem: light was conceived as a wave, and a wave requires a medium, thus the transmission of light appeared to demand that space was filled with some kind of medium; the sun acts on the earth, but action it was argued cannot act at a distance, hence it too requires a kind of medium for transmission. (In essence, both of these arguments goes back to Parmenides disavowal of the Void - the Void being where Being is not). Hence the pressing into service of Aristotles fifth element, the aether as transmission medium of light and gravity, usually known as the lumineferous aether and conceptualised mechanically. After Maxwells discovery of his equations, it was noticed that it showed that the speed of light was a constant. This raises the question constant in reference to what? Galileo had shown that the notion of rest was not well-posed. So the aether was also pressed into service as the bearer of the reference frame that Maxwells equations seemed to require. The most detailed scheme being that developed by Fresnel & Lorentz where the aether was completely motionless (note the resonance with Newton notion of space that is immovable); in fact, Max Born observed later that it would have been natural for physicists to identify the absolute space of Newton with that of the aether - what stood in the way was conceptualising space itself as a substance with properties, this despite William Clifford writing in On the Space-Theory of Matter: 

Kant was interested in formulating a rigorous basis for pure practical reason. His Categorical Imperative in his first formulation is a solution to this problem. It goes like this: 

It's thinking along these lines that prompted Kant to devise a philosophy that posited a unity of apperception; that rescued the fragmentary subject. Schopenhauer reframed Kants philosophy of the noumenon and phenomenal worlds as will (wille) and representation (vorstellung); and this wille is not of something (say God or Nature) but a wille that is self-subsistent. 

Speed is defined as 'change of distance' over 'change of time'. As an equation it is 'v=(s2-s1)/(t2-t1). In this equation speed is a derived notion from the 'extensions' (in Spinozas language) of distance and time. That is one doesn't measure speed directly; but one must measure it indirectly. The basic measurements are of space and time. Is it actually possible to show that speed can be, in fact, measured directly? 

Soul, in at least one sense is for Aristotle a principle of change. To start at the beginning: Lets takes some entity, now it can be made to change into two mutually exclusive ways; either it can be made to change by the action of another, or by itself - this is a straight-forward, logical distinction. It's the second sense that is used in soul; it changes itself - it grows, it alters, it moves; its a self-mover. 

The key word here is 'believe'. It is as much a matter of faith that one is a physicalist or a theist. They are both positions of belief. One should be careful in interpreting this, it is not facts that are subject to belief, but their interpretation. There are prominent scientists who admit human limitations, Verlinde of entropic gravity fame, said as much in an interview. Freeman Dyson in this article says:
