In junior cricket, the (adult) coaches and umpires have a responsibility to ensure player safety and should (and in my experience typically do) intervene to prevent players putting themselves in unnecessary danger in this fashion. In Australia at least, over the last 5-10 years the wearing of protective equipment by junior players has become universal due to an increased desire for player safety. On the other hand, if it is senior cricket then players can do as they wish. If you are batting and you feel that you are endangering a fielder, remember that is what they want you to think. The whole point of fielding so close is not to actually take a catch ( you don't need to be so close to do so) but to toy with the batter's mind. If the position of the fielder is worrying you, then the fielder is doing their job. Focus on your own job and let the fielder worry about their safety. Remember that the bowler is sprinting in and putting all their might into bowling a hard object as hard as possible at your head. The bowler doesn't want to hurt you as such, but your safety is none of their concern. You should have the same attitude about fielders. 

From The Laws of Cricket. On the other hand there doesn't appear to be any restriction on the face of the bat curving and from personal experience and from watching games most modern bats seem to be curved, but in the opposite direction from what you suggest, i.e. the face curves gently towards the direction of the bowler when held in a regular batting stance. One additional point is that I can't see anywhere in the laws that demand that the join of the handle and the bat be straight, just that the handle itself be straight. However, from a bat construction and transfer of force between hands and ball perspective, you wouldn't want to have anything other than a straight join of the handle and bat. Anyway, these days everyone wants to play T20 and hit sixes, so this kind of design would probably not be popular even if it were legal. 

No, you cannot practice on the pitch see The Laws of Cricket. The reason is the state of the pitch, and any wear on it, is an important part of how a game of cricket unfolds. Practicing on the pitch would alter its state and therefore could be used as a tactic in some way, so is not permitted. 

Let me start by stating I do not have a great knowledge of the typical career path for pro-cyclists, so this answer deals mostly with the question of 'making it' in any sport beyond some perceived cut off age. In any sport, whatever the age of the participants, the chance that any particularly individual, no matter how motivated and talented, will make it to the big time is slim. There are always many more people who want to make it than there are opportunities. Therefore regardless of your age, your chances of making it are small. That means you really need to love the journey, not just the hoped for destination. You have to love training hard and competing to your limit as an end in itself. If your performances are good enough, you will reach your goals but you have got to love striving or else you are setting yourself up for a giant disappointment. What would you do in response to your question? If someone said "no you're too old" would you then not bother trying? If so then you probably don't have the innate love of competing that is a requisite of success no matter what your age is. Just as a caveat regarding pro-cycling, I have several friends on the fringe of the 'serious but not pro' cycling scene and they are pretty much all on drugs. It seems that the dirtiest tier of the sport is those who are trying to 'make it'. The pros are probably largely clean these days due to the testing regimes, and the keen but never going to make it guys don't bother, but those trying to gain the attention of pro teams seem to be willing to take the risk as getting caught leads to no different outcome to not doping and not putting up a good enough performance anyway. What I hear of people using mostly is testosterone as hard training lowers the levels which take a while to recover. Artificially boosting this allows the 'athlete' to train harder and longer. A non-pro isn't going to be tested out of competition and there isn't anything in the body on competition day that would demonstrate the doping. I'm not suggesting you do this, far from it, just be aware of the dirty sport you are contemplating and the cheaters you will be competing against. 

There is no standard system, probably because the use of jersey numbers is a relatively new phenomenon in cricket, so there is no history upon which conventions have been built. As you suggest, big name players typically get to wear whatever they like another example being Shane Warne who always wears 23, the same as Michael Jordan wore in Basketball. 

The rules are very clear, the wicket keeper is the only player allowed to wear gloves. All other players would incur a 5 run penalty every time they touched the ball while wearing gloves. This includes for instance taking off your hat in order to use it to catch the ball (I have seen this done in a park cricket match!). See Law 41 in the rules of cricket 

There is some info on wikipedia. To elaborate, a backspinner is a delivery that can be bowled by either a finger spinner or a wrist spinner and refers to any delivery in which the spin put on the ball is mainly in the 'back' direction, as opposed to a side spinner or topspinner. To be clear, the direction of spin is the same as how a ball rolling back towards the bowler would be rotating. Many different bowlers, both finger and wrist spinners, have used different techniques to bowl backspinners over the years and these deliveries go by different names such as sliders, zooters, the teesra and some finger spinners 'arm ball' is basically a backspinner. Like any spin bowler variation, the intention of a backspinner is deception. The bowler hopes the batsmen will player the ball as if it was a regular stock ball and be surprised to find it behaves differently. In the case of the backspinner, the ball will tend to land fuller than the batsmen expects and bounce off the pitch lower and quicker than they expect (hence the term 'slider', the ball 'slides' off the pitch instead of bouncing up). The reason for this has to do with some simple physics (that I won't go into) and contrasts with the usual flight of a spin bowlers delivery. Usually a regular side spinning stock ball will also be topspinning somewhat, so an offspin stock ball typically is spinning towards fine leg rather than square leg and an leg spinner towards the slips rather than point. Topspin makes the ball land shorter than it would otherwise, and causes it to grip onto the pitch bouncing slower and higher than otherwise. If the batsmen has been facing many of these stock balls from a bowler they may become used to that bounce and pace. If a bowler then bowls a backspinner they may be deceived by the fuller, lower bouncing ball. This may cause them to play over the ball and be bowled or given LBW. The backspinner is not as well known as other variations, such as the googly, the doosra or the flipper probably because it is not a particularly spectacular ball. On its own it is not a particularly difficult ball to play, so a bowler wouldn't bowl it too often, but it get used as a less common variation to try and keep the batsmen uncertain about the bowler. Shane Warne made a lot of fuss later in his career over the delivery he claimed to invent which he called the 'zooter'. However, it was simply a backspinner as had been bowled by many bowlers before him and was easier for him to bowl than his other variations once his shoulder had worn out from years of bowling. 

In the recent Test series against South Africa, the Australian right arm off-spinner Nathan Lyon occasionally employed a delivery that spun the other way (away from a right hand batsmen instead of towards). I understand he has named this delivery "Jeff" for unknown reasons. There has been some sparse media coverage of this, see for instance here, but I have not managed to find any suitable footage to work out how he is doing it, such as a super slo-mo zoomed in view of the bowling hand or any articles explaining the details. There are several ways off spinners can get a ball to go the other way. The most famous is the 'doosra' employed most notably by Muttiah Muralitharan, which requires extremely flexible elbows and wrists and long fingers in order to rotate the hand around to impart spin in the desired direction. No non south asian player has ever been able to deliver this ball legally due to the different physiology of Anglo/European players, so I doubt that this is it exactly but a modified version something along these lines might be possible. The other option is to use the fingers to flick the ball the other way, almost like a regular leg break but using the middle finger to impart spin instead of the whole hand and wrist. Ajantha Mendis uses this and calls it a 'caroom' ball, while Ravichandran Ashwin calls it his 'sudoku' ball. I believe that Jason Krejza has also experimented with this (and probably a number of other spinners as well). So, does anyone know if "Jeff" falls into either of these categories or is it something else? It has also been described as a 'backspinner', which makes it more likely to be the caroom ball style delivery, or some variant of that. I'm really looking for a definitive answer here, if one can be obtained, rather than speculation or an explanation of different possibilities, which is why I've outlined at least some of them myself here in the question. 

No, both of these players are finger spinners and both right handers (so can unambiguously be described as bowling offbreaks). They in fact have, in relative terms, similar actions. They are among the few 'traditional' off spinners left in the game at the International level, in that they both only bowl the regular offspinner and the arm ball, but no schmancy doosras or caroom balls that most 'finger spinners' tend to bowl these days.

I strongly suspect that the manufacturers of Hawkeye and similar ball tracking systems would actually prefer not to have a hard 'ground truth' to compare to being beamed live to millions of viewers. These systems are not as accurate as the TV graphics imply and there use as part of the umpiring process is not all to do with accuracy. It is as much about having a non-human, dispassionate system have the final say when the humans can't agree as arguing with a machine is futile. The manufacturers of Hawkeye claim a mean accuracy of 3.6mm, although this figure, or at least its interpretation has been called into question. Basically, since this is an average over some range of shots, it is likely that the actual error in certain circumstances is significantly higher (as detailed in the second reference). Errors approaching 10mm could easily turn the correct result, as observed by the skid mark on clay ground truth, into an incorrect Hawkeye call. It would be terrible publicity to have a top player angrily pointing to the clear evidence on the court that differs from the Hawkeye prediction. 

In several forms of football (and probably other sports) there are standard variants of the game using a reduced number of players. For instance Rugby Union and Rugby League 7s (normally played by 15 and 13 a side respectively). Soccer also has futsal (5 a side instead of 11). In some of the above cases the field is a different size in others it remains the same but in all cases there are changes in the rules in addition to the reduced number of players. My question is whether there is a similar variant for Australian Rules Football? I do know junior leagues play with less players on smaller fields but that is a somewhat different thing to a 'senior' game just played with less players. 

Your best bet is to get the kind of stumps used in indoor cricket. You can see some in use for instance here. The stumps are connected to a flat solid base and are spring loaded so they return to the upright positions by themselves after being knocked over by the ball. I'm sure these could be purchased online if you can't find any at your local sports stores. 

In Rugby football codes (Rugby League and Rugby Union) it is almost universal to have a finals series decide the winner of the league. If you are brought up watching this kind of sport this seems perfectly normal and the lack of finals in most soccer leagues seems weird and anti-climactic. Indeed, in the Australian A-league (top level soccer league) they have a finals series probably because it is present in every other major sport played in the country and its absence would seem very strange. The fans and players all look forward to the month of footy finals at the end of the year and there are a lot of traditions surrounding the finals. Yes, I'm sure broadcasters and stadium owners love the revenue it generates but this was the structure long before commercial interests became important. Fans want to see the top teams battle it out for the premiership instead of the winner being decided by bean counters, possibly weeks before the end of the season causing the last few games to peter out into meaningless exchanges. 

If a low rated team beats a high rated team, the rating will change by more than if two very closely rated teams play. You can never get a negative rating, since what happens in the calculation is that there are ratings points and the number of games in the ratings period. The actual rating is the points divided by number of games. You can only earn ratings points, so if you lose every game you just have zero points. However, if you get earn no points from a game your rating will decrease since the ratings points stays the same but the number of games increases. The full details of the ICC rating system is given in on wikipedia. An important aspect is that more recent matches are given a greater weighting than more distant games. Originally, the idea was that all teams must play every other team within a time window (I think it was 5 years) and only the most recent series against each opponent would count and be weighted equally. This was abandoned in favour of the above mentioned weighting of recent games because the cricket boards didn't want to be locked in rigidly to completing all the series that this would require. Basically teams like India, Australia, England and South Africa want to be playing each other much more often because that generates more revenue than playing against smaller countries like New Zealand or the West Indies. Particularly, everyone wants to play India as much as possible because that is where most of the money in world cricket flows from. The ICC maintains separate ratings tables for Test Cricket, One Day cricket and T20 cricket. There are not the same number of teams in each table, since there are fewer Test playing nations than ODI and T20. 

Without going into the specifics of each type of dismissal, the general principle is if there is doubt, the on field Umpire's call stands. The review has to be able to conclusively demonstrate that the Umpire was wrong in order to over-turn the decision. This is a different statement than the review simply makes the most likely decision, given the evidence. 

If a fielder is past the boundary rope it doesn't matter whether they are airborne or not, it is still a six. If the player jumps from within the field of play, catches the ball and throws it back before hitting the ground, then they will have prevented the six from scoring (and if they or a team mate can then catch the ball again before it hits the ground the batter will be out). Once the fielder has stepped across the boundary line, if they touch the ball then it will be a six.
