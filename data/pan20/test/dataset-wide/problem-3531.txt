Keep in mind that prevention is the best strategy here. By the time you recognize the symptoms of dehydration, your body has already been dehydrated for some time. Your body can actually be dehydrated without actually showing the symptoms of dehydration. Here are some tips for preventing dehydration: 

My suggestion is to start slow and don't overdo it. Set very small, achievable goals that you can measure every week. For instance, you could start by going for a walk every day during your break time at work and also supplement the walk with some stretching. Stick with this for more than three weeks (so that it becomes a habit) and then add something else to the list, such as a run or some weight lifting. You could also sign up for a class at your local gym or community center. The regular schedule and social/group aspects of the class environment may help keep you motivated and also give you a place where you have to be. My local gym runs a bootcamp in the Spring, Summer, and Fall, and I am seriously considering taking it myself because I'm having trouble staying consistent at my gym. 

Using the JFit categories here. The workouts fit into Bulking, Cutting, General, Sport. I understand that progression on a cut will be limited and you should assume that both the cut or bulk are clean (good macros) and accompanied with good sleep. What (if any) are the key differences in terms of progression, exercises and volume of a program that is designed to be paired with a bulk (like German Volume 10x10) and those which are meant to be paired with a cut (ICF). 

You want to increace the size of your muscles, this process is called muscle hypertrophy and it involves an increase in size of skeletal muscle through a growth in size of its component cells. Two factors contribute to hypertrophy: sarcoplasmic hypertrophy, which focuses more on increased muscle glycogen storage; and myofibrillar hypertrophy, which focuses more on increased myofibril size. Generally speaking, the effects of exercise are thus: 

The amount of 'fat you will burn' during a single day is minimal. Even over a few weeks it will be minimal while eating at a caloric-sustain (which this sounds like). Your body does not adapt that fast. "Eat Excessively" is wonderfully inaccurate, "excessive" could be anywhere between 3000 and 10,000 calories. 

You say you've already encountered some pain, and pain can lead to swelling due to damage to the previously underdeveloped soft tissues in your feet. While the pain going away is a good thing, the swelling is a sign that you should still proceed with caution. From Today's Health Information - Swollen Feet: 

I spent about 6 to 7 years working out hard both in the gym and running, when I was in college. When I graduated and got a job, I stopped working out cold turkey. After about 3 years working, I realized I needed to get back into exercising regularly. I've since since started working out again and weight more than ever. I want to lose weight and gain muscle. Should I take supplements that are all protein or should I take supplements that provide more carbohydrates? 

If slowing down instead of stopping seems to help then why not just go that route. When I was in the Army, we didn't stop running. We slowed down, but we didn't stop. Part of it is keeping a rhythm and is mental, the other part is adrenalin. Keep in mind that in order to increase your aerobic fitness, you must keep your heart rate up above a certain threshold over a sustained period of time. If you stop running, you risk letting your heart rate drop below the level necessary to increase your level of aerobic fitness. 

Because you are using them they become engorged with blood that is being used to provide oxygen to the muscle. Keep doing bicep curls (in various styles) and keep increasing the weight so it is challenging. 

YES The weights they use in those videos are still geared towards "cardio with resistance". IT is fine to mix both, "les mills body pump classes" do exactly this and have been effective for people wishing to increase their cardio activity. 

I would agree a fit person should be able to relatively easily do 4-5 sets of 8-12 jumping lunges with a short rest period. Without some video of you doing the exercise we cannot tell if you are doing It wrong, but it sounds like you are just weak. Rep counting is whatever you make of it, in my view (and CrossFit's view) every time you move your legs it counts as a rep. If you were doing a standing lunge you might up it to 8 on each leg. 28 reps of press-ups is reasonably good, and is quite high, I wouldn't personally bother going above 20 reps because beyond that you are just building muscle endurance which I don't really care for. Solution: Use a easier scaled movement. Instead of jumping, just lunge from a standing position and then return to standing straight (step lunge). The more you practice, the better you will become. 

In summary, it's wise to proceed with caution. Listen to your body carefully. If you start to experience more pain, it may be a sign to take it easy, use more ice, pay attention to your form, or even take a break and give your feet time to completely heal. If the swelling doesn't go away on it's own or if the pain comes back, it may be wise to seek medical advice, just to be on the safe side. 

One of the things you can do to help prevent as much damage as possible is to ice your feet and ankles. This will also help reduce the swelling. Keep in mind that, according to Natually Engineered, some pain early on is common and is to be expected. Here is their advice on how to proceed: 

Source: $URL$ Heat related conditions: Know the signs and symptoms of heat cramps, heat rash, heat exhaustion, and heat stroke. Preventing dehydration is one step to avoid these conditions. I want to emphasize how important it is to prevent dehydration. Although it's great that you're asking how to treat dehydration, it's important that you don't rely on treatment alone. People who have had heat injuries previously are more likely to have a heat injury in the future. Thus, the healthier you stay now, the less likely you are to become a victim of a heat injury in the future.
