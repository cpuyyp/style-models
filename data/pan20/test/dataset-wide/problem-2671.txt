One of the most unique and influential responses to the problem of evil can be seen as underlying the Platonic and neo-Platonic philosophies. In essence, the concept is that only Good really exists, that what appears to us as evil is primarily the absence of Good, and to a secondary extent, imperfect and corrupted copies or images of the Good. You can picture the (neo-) Platonic cosmos as a solar system of increasingly imperfect and unreal images orbiting around a godlike and perfect singularity in the center, with our own "reality" at a fair distance from the center. To the extent that this is compelling, it rests on the observation that Good is much more difficult to explain than evil. Evil can be explained as the absence of Good, but the existence of actual Good as originating from within an imperfect world is nearly impossible to explain or even comprehend. However, this conception does nothing to explain why there would be imperfect copies in the first place, or how a perfect entity could ever give rise to a universe containing any imperfection. It's worth noting that in Plato's most direct treatment of the subject, the Timaeus, the universe is NOT created by the divine singularity, but only in imitation of it. Once the divine singularity is identified with the Creator God, the problem of evil becomes orders of magnitude more acute. 

This relates to what I think is one of the greatest problems of philosophy, the problem of specificity. Why does the world have the form it has? Why is pi 3.14159...? Why are you the person you are, in the place that you are, with the lifespan you have, with the limits on your knowledge that you have? And, more to the point of your question, how should you respond to the specificity of your life? I think the right answer is to embrace the specificity, but to also bring it back in to relation with the social and the universal, as follows: Work on developing your unique talents and interests in the ways that will best serve the world at large, and pursue all the fields of study that appear to directly advance that goal. In this way, although you will never encompass all knowledge, or even a very large percentage of it, you will know that you have encompassed all the knowledge most personally relevant to your purpose in the universe to the limit of your ability to identify and acquire it. 

You are correct that the conclusion of any valid deductive argument contains at most a subset of the information contained in the premises. However, until you work through the proof you don't know if the premises and conclusion actually hold that relationship to one another. What you gain via the deductive argument is new information about the equivalence of things not previously demonstrated to be equivalent. This can be very useful because it uncovers patterns and relationships that would otherwise be disguised by the superficial differences in the way the equivalent information is expressed. 

I can't speak for other modern Platonists, but I can give you my perspective: When interpreting Plato, I find it a mistake to take him too literally. According to his view of the world, the capital T Truth wasn't something that could ever be completely captured in ordinary language. All of his writing should be viewed as primarily metaphorical, aimed at helping people discover the Real for themselves, rather than as an actual attempt at capturing or defining the Real. I would imagine philosophers and mathematicians who continue to find Platonism compelling do so for the same reason they always have. Some aspect of their work begins to convince them that there must be a deeper level of reality than the one available to our ordinary senses, and it seems to align in a profound sense with the deeper level of reality described by Plato, even if it isn't a perfect match in the details. Thus, I would consider myself at the least in sympathy with Platonism, even though I don't have a belief in an Ideal Realm of the Forms as described in Plato's dialogs. 

Outside of the context of a tightly controlled thought experiment, there's nothing to suggest that your personal death would do anything substantial to improve conditions for the rest of us. The Earth actually has more than enough resources to sustain an even larger population than the one we have. The real problem is that we are consuming resources wastefully, inefficiently, and needlessly. As Gandhi said, "The Earth has enough resources to meet the needs of all, but not enough to satisfy the greed of even one person." There is also little to suggest that your own death would inspire the needed cultural change to shift to sustainable living, or that even the voluntary suicides of massive percentages of the population would keep the remaining people from offsetting any gains with increased consumption. If you are willing to die to promote sustainable living, a better, and potentially more effective option might be to devote your life to that same end (while, of course, personally living as sustainably as possible). 

The simplest form of modern symbolic logic is propositional logic. This is what I would expect to start with for a beginning logic student. If we translate these sentences into propositional logic, both have the form: 

This question demands analysis at a higher level than simple reading comprehension. In the case of (E) we can see that the author has very deliberately avoided overreaching the evidence to make such a claim. However, in the case of (C), this is a new piece of information we can reasonably infer from the facts presented in the essay, even though it is not explicitly presented itself. 

From a Judeo-Christian perspective, several passages in the Bible, most notably the initial creation account in Genesis, suggest that God is an artist or an artisan, who takes pleasure in the sheer act of creation. 

I'm far from being an Wittgenstein expert, but this sounds like a somewhat inaccurate account of some of the theses of Wittgenstein's famous work, the Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus, to the effect that all philosophical problems are nothing more than issues with language, and that logic is incapable of teaching us anything we don't already know. Wittgenstein himself later rejected some of his own early conclusions, which would match the idea that "the claim has been proven false." There is quite a lot written on the Tractatus, and my gloss on it should not be relied upon --you can get a start on a better picture of it at $URL$ 

I think the easiest to understand refutation of reductionism involves fractals. There is a well known fractal that can be generated by folding a piece of paper. If you take a long strip of paper, fold it in half, and then in half again (always folding the same direction), and keep on doing so, then (if it were physically possible to make sure every crease was sharp) the shape that the paper would take, viewed edge on, when you unfold it partially so that every crease now is a 90 angle, is called the dragon fractal. Below is the fractal that would be generated if you could fold it just 13 times: 

Studying logic helps you understand the underlying structure of arguments. I don't personally see it as a prerequisite to reading philosophy, but it can definitely be helpful. However, if you do start with logic, I would stick to the modern logic, rather than the Aristotelian, which is of more historical than practical utility at this point in time. As far as your second question --everyone will have a different answer. I would argue in favor of starting with Plato and Descartes, in terms of those being two of the figures most universally responded to by subsequent philosophers. (For example, much of Nietzsche is proposed in reaction against Plato, and Kant is widely viewed as a synthesis of Descartes and Hume.) Even if you aren't a fan of those philosophers yourself, reading them will still give you a context to start from --and both have some relatively short, accessible, but central works to start with (Meno, Apology, Symposium for Plato --or even The Republic which is a little longer, but is probably the most famous work of philosophy in the western world; Meditations for Descartes, which arguably comes in second). 

Plato and Descartes are not that hard, but it is tough to find translations in written in easy language. If I can be allowed, I will recommend my own rendition of 

This is a better question than it first appears. On the one hand, the underlying purpose of bringing logic into any argument is really to clarify commitments, increase understanding and expose contradictions. It's hard to see that as a bad or bad faith thing to do in any argument (unless it is actually deployed in explicit bad faith, which is something that can be done with any tool of communication). On the other hand, attempts (such as the trolley problem) to use logic to clarify and organize moral intuitions have proven --in my personal opinion --morally unhelpful to an extent that suggests they may misunderstand or misconstrue something fundamental about moral principles. So my own answer to your question would be twofold: 

I don't think this is correct. Formal logic, like mathematics, is typically atemporal, it deals with structural relationships, not progressions. For example, the logical statement IF A THEN B may sound like something that takes place in time, with A happening first and B happening second, but in actuality it just means that in the case that A is true, B must also be true.
