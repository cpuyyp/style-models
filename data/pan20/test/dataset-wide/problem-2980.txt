Iain Banks, another writer of science fiction, in his Culture novels posits a universe where vast spaceships are under the beneficent control of artificial minds many magnitudes greater than that of humans; they are entirely enigmatic. So, certainly the SF corpus does not consistently draw artificial intelligence as uniformly dystopian. Of course none of the above is strictly philosophical in the academic sense, but this isn't an issue that can be fruitfully discussed in a sensible way (yet);for the forseeable future, as user4894 posits, humanitys greatest danger to itself is probably itself - and it is the recognition of this that determines one perspective on ethics, and in fact the only one in the secular world-view (in other traditions, such as the Abrahamic religions it is sanctioned by God) Hawking & Musk are right to be concerned, but their concern must be interpreted given that AI in the proper sense - self-awareness and consciousness - isn't possible in the forseeable future, does not mean that technologies that fit within this narrative may not be ethically dangerous in the near future. This is already being seen in drone warfare and mass surveillance. 

James Lovelock controversially proposed the Gaia hypothesis in the 1970s which outraged certain sensibilities because of its implicit teleology (I recall being outraged by it when I read about it thirty years in an article in New Scientist as it seemed to contradict the principles of natural evolution/selection which on the face of it isn't teleological); however an essay that I read recently in a collection of essays by Stephen Gould showed that the hypothesis could be tested (through computer simulations), and Lovelock won the 2006 Wollaston prize awarded by the Geological Society of London in part for this work. I also recall reading an essay of Liebniz where he discussed revisiting a notion of the ancients, entelchy; and from what I recall from reading about Aristotle, this is part of a nexus of notion tied to understanding the universe as an organic whole, aka a organism, so that the universe is a kind of cosmic organism (A did discuss evolution, only to rule it out as not being an adequate enough notion). It occurred to me a few weeks ago that Gaia hypothesis could be taken as understood as restricting the Aristotelian notion to this earth; this earth as a terrestrial organism; I'm not particularly au fait with the literature on the philosophy of biology, but I'm curious what part teleological ideas played in biology in the modern era, before, upto and after Lovelock - as I've pointed out above, I had taken it to be a non-licit notion in biology. 

There is are a number of books by Graham Priest on this; the general term is dialethism: the proposition that there are true contradictions. 

Marxs theory of value uses the input of Labour as determinining Production Value. But what if we can do away with Labour? For example, consider a perfectly automated factory producing mugs. This has no labour input. (To set up the factory requires capital but not labour). I'm using this as a gedanken-experiment to illustrate: 

According to this, is the number one equal to one? But is this what W is asking, when he is asking about objects - are they objects of the world or objects in some platonic realm? For example, there are two cups on the table next to me; can I say that cup=cup? When I examine them they are in fact different, one having spots and the other one stripes... 

Taking Ancient Greece to signify the Athens of Plato and Aristotle then there are an agreed upon set of philosophical schools that preceded them; they're usually designated as the pre-socratics and tend to be seen as theorising on cosmology ie metaphysics rather than ethics. Thus Parmenides and Pythagorus theorising on the One as Permenance; Heraclitus on Change as the only real; Democritus and Leucippus on atoms; Empedocles as forces as contraries and the four elements. Diogenes Laertius, who wrote the Lives of the Philosophers mentions even then there was a controversy as to whether philosophy originated in Greece or Egypt; and Plato himself, in some of his dialogues mentions that philosophers visited Egypt; so it is likely some influence came through in that direction particularly when one remembers that philosophy wasn't distinguished from mytho-poetic thought; and through the genre of wisdom literature (examples of which are the proverbs in the Hebrew Bible). Given the linguistic connections between Indo-European languages it's worth noticing that in the Mahabharata that sages and ascetics figure prominently (in a way they don't in Classical Greek myth) and form an axis between Priest and King which predates the notion of the philosopher-king in Platos Republic. 

The use of language here is lyrically complex, rhythmic with repitition and alliteration; combining symbols of magic, adventure, madness, eros and intimations of mystery - together with profane, sacred and the sublime and this in final stretch of everyday prose so it stands out like some low luminous flame. 

The current dominant paradigm for the modern intellect is scientific & mathematical. One has only to leaf through the books of Grothendieck to see just how baroque the constructions of a small sub-discipline (Algebraic Geometry) can become, initially it was laughed off as abstract nonsense, which is richly ironic as mathematics itself is seen to be itself far removed from the real world by the layman. Similar things can be said for String Theory. Here the speculation is that atoms are not extensionless points but actually have extension. But note it was never proved that points were extensionless. It was a speculation that became a fact - until means and desires were seen useful in moving away from this position. The key point about Christian Rationalist Metaphysics is simply they took God for granted. This is similar to Rationalist Islamic Theology - Kalam - which also took Allah as granted. 

I'd argue that matter and energy are substances in the category of empirical scientific knowledge. In fact they can change without changing. That is accidental features can change. For example the arrangement of matter or energy. Of course one can now consider materiality to be contingent and accident - so energy then becomes the only substance. From this angle the conservation laws of energy and matter are intuitively obvious. In fact they characterise matter and energy as substances. Historically of course they were induced from examples & partial theories of energy and matter. If one includes in the idea of substance that it is self-dependent then one may ascend (or descend) to a theological argument. I believe that it is one of the classical arguments (I do not say proof deliberately as proof is so tied up with mathematical argument) for the existence of God - or knowledge of his nature; Spinoza alludes to this in his Ethics. He admits two substances are known to us - extension and mental - amongst an infinite number of them. Al-Ghazali, Islamic theologian, even given the world, posited that God intervened at every moment to make everything happen. One can say he polices and enacts the laws of the world. This theory is knows as Occasionalism. Here it isn't enough that there are substances, God is neccessary to make it work. 

Metaphysics is the name of a book by Aristotle, it wasn't named as such by him, but by a later anonymous commentator; it didn't then carry the heavy burden of meaning that it does now, but simply meant this should be studied after the study of physics, even though it dealt with phenomena that underlay physics and made it intelligible. Before one can do physics one must ask what is space and time. Aristotle in his Physics, considered that time is motion of bodies, and that the two are inextricably linked. Thus it is not possible to think of space, time, motion independently. In his Metaphysics, Aristotle thought of 'beings qua beings', that is beings in so far as they are beings; his theoretical exegesis is subordinated to the idea of ousia, or substance. Descarte defined substance as that which needs no other to exist. (In this strict sense God is the only substance, and this line of thought was developed further by Spinoza). When one now looks at Newtons definition of space in the Principia, he writes: 

No - neither ethically or aesthetically. A symbol, such as the Rose in Yeats who drew on European symbolism to craft a new poetic idiom out of the folk and myths of Celtic Ireland - the uncreated conscience of his race. One cannot identify the symbol Rose with the word Rose; as one can verify by checking a good dictionary; The symbol Rose is its sense; it is a new sense of that word that is built by reference to his ouevre. Frege was interested in the logical structure of language and its relation to the world of facts; whereas Conceptual poetry, building on its roots from Dada is exists: 

Set theory, which in the usual account, founds mathematics, is atomistic. A set is ontologically composed of its elements and nothing else. This has a family resemblence to atomism. Category Theory is fundamentally relational and also, on some accounts, is capable of founding mathematics. 

Now, Kant looks at a virtuous reason for an excess of virtue, rather than a malicious reason; that is clarity, 'precision' and 'stability' - these concerns are particularly evident when morality is framed in law. (A malicious reason would be to use morality, in effect, to police or tyrannise society). 

so the cost of training lots of staff to redistributed to customers (and a profit-seeking company will ensure that all the costs saved will not be disbursed to customers through cheaper tickets unless it's hand is forced by actual competitive pressure - but the larger the company the less this possibility is possible; and one gets a kind of cartel by a kind of indirect consensus - actually one notices this in the game of Go, which is a game of territory capture, where two evenly matched players tend to divide the board into two roughly equal parts); but however this cost is redistributed the actual total cost remains the same. He also points out the notion of scale: distributing the costs of flight-booking to customers who (once these systems have resolved themselves into standardised forms) are 

I think this will be similar to what Pascal mentions at the beginning of his Pensees; where he contrasts ignorance and idle curiosity which pursues knowledge to no end. 

Paraconsistent logic which modifies classical logic by rejecting the principle of explosion or ex contradictione sequitur quodlibet can be seen purely formally. The question remains as to how one interprets the logic - that is what is its semantics. One broad class of paraconsistent logics are dual-intuitionistic logics. Now the standard semantics of intuitionisitic logic uses Kripke frames. Does one dualise here to get semantics for dual-intuitionistic logics? EDIT Priest, in his paper Dualising intuitionistic negation shows that dualising the truth condition for negation in the Kripke frame gives a paraconsistent logic which he calls a De Costa logic (it is stronger than Da Costa own logic - C-Omega). So, the semantics of De Costa logic has a Kripke possible world semantics but with negation dualised. This implies that there is more than one way to dualise intuitionistic logic. I'm primarily interested in viewing intuitionistic logic as a heyting algebra in category theory, and standardly dualising that to get co-heyting algebras. 

There are no 'logical' connectives here. Having said this, 'logical' connectives are not traditionally part of the vocabulary of linguists. It is part of the vocabulary of computer science - and specifically that of the design of computer languages. Babies learn speech on small fragments of conversation which one suspects do not have the 'logical' connectives that you mention. Surely communication is happening here. In a much wider context, semiotics, the science of signs and signifiers, communication happens without 'logical' connectives. For example, the display of a clock. Perhaps one could imagine signage in an airport offering options so are implicitly offering the logical connective 'or' - but then could not one imagine that a brick on the floor offering implicitly a range of options - as in pick it up and put it in on a nearby table OR pick it up and chuck it at a window? Telling someone to F*** O** brutally conveys a message, as does hitting someone. People communicate by facial expression, by their posture and motion. In short - effective communication does happen without 'logical connectives. 

Einstein showed that energy is matter; for something to exist in a physical sense it must be incarnated as matter. So on the face of it - it seems that the answer should be no. However what about empty space - it certainly exists. Then there is no matter and hence no energy, and since also there is no matter space cannot be curved so energy can't be stored in the curvature of space. 

In this modal logic we can show that it satisfies a fixed point theorem which says, if given a predicate A(p) depending on a propositional variable p, then there is a formula q in which p does not appear, and 

I want to be clear here. An agent is rational if his motivations can be rationally explicable whether we can deduce them or not, or whether she herself is aware of them or not. Its a fundamental assumption to make. But I'm wondering philosophically, just how true this is. Can anyones motivations be so reduced? It's the kind of assumption that one makes in physics, and it seems to have been spectacularly successful there. It seems to me that this supposition has been historically imported from that direction. Is this true? To me, its more like a useful working hypothesis, to see what can be further deduced, than having any truth value itself 

Once logic has been formalised, it's an easy move to ask whether certain axioms can be altered. One of these is that logic is two-valued. This has been done and we have formal multi-valued logic. Ordinary language sustains an idea of truth & falsity which fits in with the usual logic. Is there some way of understanding the truth of a multi-valued logic in ordinary language? 

I think the two are difficult to disentangle easily. For example: Buddhism is often taken to be more philosophical rather than a religion, but I think this comes from viewing religion from a Christian perspective. Also Byran Magee (British philosopher) remarks in his autobiography that Kants philosophical thought can be seen as a rationalisation of the pietist tradition he was brought up in. Acharya Sen, an expert on indian medieval literature and hinduism points out that hinduism includes the lokyata/carvaka tradition which was empirical & scientific. He also writes that rational inquiry is an investigation into the impersonal side of Brahman. Pythagoras is said to have declared the universe is number and geometry in mystical reverie, this is still current today in the popular imagination, for example the Higgs boson referred to as the 'God' particle, and physicists and mathematicians seen as the high priests of a technocratic world (look at how they are referred to within science fiction). David Wallace an american novelist writes that human beings are worshipful beings, they have no choice in this - what they do get is the choice of what to worship.
