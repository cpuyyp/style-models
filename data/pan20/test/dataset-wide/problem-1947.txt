I understand your feeling - it's like you have been "ratted out" unnecessarily. But, I would not call her behavior "extremely rude". It's entirely possible that she simply wanted to avoid a personal confrontation with you - not everyone is comfortable undertaking such a thing. You might be skilled at doing it the right way, but not everyone is. She also might believe that in a work environment, the appropriate action is to go through the chain of command - there is good argument to be made for that approach - keeps things business-like and impersonal. 

Risky behavior IMO, because it immediately raises the question: What are you doing now? Why are you going behind the back of your current employer to contact me when I haven't contacted you: It sounds like you're not very loyal or trustworthy... 

Not a good idea IMO. We'll assume you've previously a evaluated a few candidates in terms of competence and they came out even, and then you let HR make the final decision, based on who is 'less competitive'. Having HR make the decision could be disastrous: They will want to the hire "Mr. Nice Guy", ignoring other factors. HR looks at everything from an HR perspective, and they generally love "Mr. Nice Guy", all the more so if you tell them to hire someone who doesn't compete with others. Regardless, I would strongly recommend against relinquishing to HR any power you and other people with expert knowledge have regarding hiring - it will come back to bite you. HR evaluates people based on their HR criteria - they are not experts in the actual work and its requirements - they have a different agenda than yours, and like anyone else, if you give them power, whether or not they rightfully deserve it, it will be difficult to get it back when necessary. 

A friend of mine was recently laid off from a contracting gig. It was made clear from the beginning when he was first offered the role that it was a "high risk" position in the sense that both the role and the project itself were on shaky ground and there was a high chance that the engagement might not last for more than a few months. He weighed his options and decided to give the role a try anyway (The long term rewards if the project did work out were worth it). Last week (after 4 months) it was decided that they would not continue with him (which he was sort of expecting since the project hadn't been doing well), but they didn't give him a few days notice or even a few hours notice. Instead the person he reported to and an HR rep just walked up to his desk and asked him to leave on the spot, the didn't even let him touch his laptop. They did say that his dismissal had nothing to do with his performance or anything, he was doing his job well, but the company had changed strategy. So why couldn't they be nice about it? Even when people are laid off or dismissed for performance reasons, they are at least given to the end of the day to leave. Being asked to get out there and then and being escorted out like that made look like he had done something wrong when in fact the dismissal had nothing to do with his performance. To make things worse, he works in a highly specialized field with only a small number of companies in his city. People would have noticed the abrupt departure and rumors are bound to spread that something bad had occurred, thus negatively effecting his future career prospects. Is there anything he do about this? How can he repair the damage to his reputation? Is there anything he can ask for from his ex-employer to mitigate this? 

Every industry, and every firm, has its own attitudes about this sort of thing, so if you don't know for sure, you should play it safe when taking a new job: IMO you need to do three things in order to figure out how best to handle this: 

concerns nothing but how you can execute your current tasks more effectively and become a better employee. If that's not something to take up with a mentor, what is? Your second point: 

IMO your idea may not be entirely appropriate. I've been a code jockey for twenty years and never been in a situation where my bosses or co-workers were too interested in what I or others did on our own time, except in the most casual manner - friendly conversation, nothing more. For many years I had my own side projects using technologies that weren't being used at work, and if my bosses would have started picking my brain about such things I would have been reluctant to share unless I knew that I would benefit from it at work. What did happen many times was that I was able to make contributions at work that I was compensated for because of knowledge and experience I had accumulated from my own home projects - I was able to advance because I was knowledgeable about the technologies I had been working with on my own, because they became relevant to projects at work. But I never voluntarily brought my home projects into the office to share. This might not be "nice", but such is the nature of the business world: Developers are laborers for the firm that do work and receive compensation therefrom, not friends and family of their bosses and co-workers. We all know the hard, cold reality of business: A new boss or co-worker or merger or acquisition comes along, or you slip up badly somehow, and before you know it, you're out hunting for a new job. So, you keep your hobbies and private projects to yourself, just like any other aspect of your personal life that you don't share at work. You've already mentioned that you have limitations due to management, etc. Perhaps you should be taking these limitations as a cue that your idea isn't such a good one. 

They have been unresponsive in my attempts to communicate with them. And from the way they talk to us, and from rumors circulating around the company grapevine, I get the impression that we are looked down on as mere technicians supporting an obsolete legacy app compared to the cutting edge development work they are doing. I also feel that the company higher-ups have a similar impression of our respective teams. Questions: 

I work as part of a tech team team that handles database applications for various business statistics. Our database platform is somewhat dated, but the business application that runs on it uses sophisticated statistical methods and generates very complex models. There's a data science team at my company, who are supposed to be the "mad scientists/skunk ops" group, and are developing algorithms that perform the same business function that our teams' software performs. They are using the latest trendy development tools and languages and running their code on the cloud as opposed to on physical servers. However, the actual models they are generating are rudimentary and they are nowhere near achieving the functionality or scale that our application is capable of, despite how dated our platform is. Moreover, both myself and my team have more experience with the business area that we are working on than they do. I want to collaborate with them for two reasons: 

As you certainly realize, they probably want your Dad out of there. A new young boss comes in and wants to make things their own, so "out with the old, in with the new". Is it smart, nice, polite or appropriate? No. But like they say in the gangster movies, "It's not personal - it's just business". There usually isn't much you can do about it unless a new and more appropriate role can be found for someone like your dad. That may or may not be a viable option in your case. 

No need to "apologize". IMO that is decidedly unprofessional, unless your client explicitly pushes you up against the wall about it. If that does comes to pass, don't try to squirm out of it, just apologize that you're still a beginner and tried your best, but you're not yet seasoned in making accurate time estimates. Don't get into long explanations and excuses. Be short, to the point, and professional. Offering "extras" as compensation for the delay might not be such a good idea, as others have mentioned: That tends to cheapen you and makes you appear a bit desperate (never a good thing), puts focus on your lack of experience, and leaves you vulnerable to endless requests for "freebees", etc. But what's done is done. Avoid that in the future. You didn't charge based on time, you were up front and honest with them from the beginning, and priced the work based on your experience. So, I think you are off to a good start. As long as you delivered a solid working product, I don't think you need be too concerned. The client may seem impatient, but if you did a good job they will soon be appeased when they enjoy the fruits of your labor. For the future: Until you get really good at estimating your delivery times (that takes quite a while, and often even experts make mistakes on that) triple or quadruple (at least...) the number that first seems viable to you.
