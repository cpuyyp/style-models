The prescriptionist scientist in me rejects the question as meaningless! The descriptivist in me compels me to try to answer the question you meant to ask. 

This idea that "extraordinary claims requires extraordinary evidence" (also known as Sagan's Standard) means that we must provisionally accept the more prosaic explanation - e.g. that there is no secret colony on Mars - until some significant evidence suggests the opposite. This is an extraordinary claim. It would require a huge conspiracy far beyond the bounds of any we have ever discovered to date. Because that extraordinary evidence is lacking - in fact any evidence at all is lacking - the only reasonable answer that can be given is "No." 

So, the electoral system support self-nomination, and everyone votes for the candidates directly. Note that nomination requires the collection of massive numbers of signatures. I consider this to be merely administrative evidence that the potential candidate is a serious contender, as opposed to getting permission from a party, so I argue this still fits into the definition. I understand Russia to have a similar signature-gathering hurdle. I suspect there are many more examples. So the USA is not the only democracy in the world where anyone can declare himself or herself a candidate for the presidency. 

So, there is no protocol to contact local zoos. Further, they reference another paper that considered the zoo angle for CTPA. ( CT pulmonary angiography is a particular subset of CT (computer tomography) diagnostic test. 

[Source: The Phoenix Gazette. "Say What?" 23 February 1996, via Snopes] Barr is not a reliable authority and I haven't found any real evidence of this. Same size? The link you gave claims she was a size 12. However, dress sizes are poorly standardized and have changed over time (Ref). A size 12 in the 1940-50s has become a size 6 now (Ref). So this information isn't very helpful. Smaller But, in fact we have evidence that she was smaller than a modern size 12. US catalog sizes put modern day Size 12 as roughly: 

Conclusion: fermented alcoholic drinks were known to be consumed at breakfast in different cultures, including beer-soup (which very different to the beers we drink today), ales, wine and spirits. However, different geographies, classes, periods and individual families had different preferences, making the overall claim that beer was the most popular breakfast drink too broad to be true. 

Summary There are several studies that measure factors of human emotional temperament and well-being that could reasonably described as "happiness" in an informal setting. Genetics account for a large part of the variability (i.e. you can make a good guess about someone's temperament if you subject their identical twin to a questionnaire), but the exact percentage of the variability accounted for varies between studies techniques. A 50% estimate is a reasonable short-hand. 

The author, Nina Shen Rastogi, goes on to quote an unreferenced anecdote about an anonymous person's mother-in-law from a competing Q&A site. This emphasizes to me that the Slate article, itself, isn't from a peer-reviewed journal, and is a pretty ordinary reference. Can anyone do better? 

All of these are reports that have only been scrutinised by a journalist. In 2006, an "arbitrator" found that "the New York Police Department violated state labor law by setting traffic summons quotas in a Brooklyn precinct and then penalizing officers who failed to meet them". [1] [2] It is unclear what the standards of evidence are for an arbitrator, but presumably some scrutiny was given to the claim. Open Policies In other jurisdictions, the quota may be/have been official policy: 

I believe all of this to be true. If anyone proposed to set flouride levels to the point they could trigger skeletal fluorosis, that would be terrible. Fortunately, I have seen no proposals to exceed the World Health Organization recommended maximum fluoride value at which fluorosis should be minimal [ref: Fawell J, Bailey K, Chilton J, Dahi E, Fewtrell L, Magara Y. Fluoride in Drinking-water [PDF]. World Health Organization; 2006. ISBN 92-4-156319-2. Guidelines and standards. p. 37–9. via Wikipedia]. 

In conclusion, BCG has more occurrences of both mild and severe reactions than HPV vaccines, while MMR vaccines have much more occurrences of severe reactions than HPV vaccines. 

Born in mid 1883, he would have been about 28 in 1911. So, according to his diaries, he had sex with a 16-year-old, while aged 28, and others that he described as "boys" (which can be a broad term for ages). I don't know if the age of consent has changed recently in Italy (which I assumed is the Etna referred to), but it is currently 14 years old, so if he did that today, he would not be committing a crime. Judging historical figures' behaviour by today's/local social mores is often tricky. (Somehow, I don't think he would have written it in his diary if he knew, a century later, the semantics would be debated in public.) And, of course, his ideas should be argued on their merits, not on his taste in sexual partners. 

They vaguely attribute it to "National Center for Biotechnology Information, U.S. National Library of Medicine, The Associated Press", where the trail runs cold. 

No, it is not the case that results are pre-calculated in gaming machines. The result of each game is calculated independently and on-the-fly. Gaming machines' randomness is validated statistically by independent companies such as Gaming Laboratories International. [Warning: Site has annoying voice-over.] 

In general, the tone of her article is strongly hostile to Hitler, but sympathetic to both the German people and the minorities who suffered under Hitler. 

A related issue is "toilet-seat contact dermatitis" which is an allergic reaction to the materials in the toilet seat, as opposed to an infectious disease. 

They looked at a couple of found some evidence that some of the surgical techniques lead to people giving lower pain/disability scores afterwards than other surgical techniques. However: 

From the abstract, we can see this isn't an experimental paper, but just an overview. Tomatoes (i.e. Solanum lycopersicum) do not appear in the article's abstract, unlike in the newspaper article where they feature heavily. The article does talk about the difficulty of classification into "carnivorous" 

Is there evidence that cruise-control increases risk of dangerous accidents when the road is wet or icy? I guess I will accept evidence of manufacturer's warnings, although I would rather actual studies that include all risks rather than the single risk of hydroplaning. (I'm aware that car safety systems have improved, so I am open to answers that say 'It used to be true, but not any more.') 

Another line of evidence was the absence of behaviours associated with other insects trying to detect odours. 

Source: Wüsthof brochure, vintage ~1994. (I still have it, and can scan it in if required.) I avoided putting them in the dishwasher, until I had a partner who refused to treat them with such respect. (To quote Wüsthof, it was an "outrage"!) For domestic harmony reasons, I got over it. 

As commenter, SubZero1703 pointed out on this YouTube video of (apparently) the same phenomena, at the 20 second mark there is point where the camera moves, and the UFOs move with it. It is unlikely that real world objects would happen to speed-up/slow-down exactly in time with the camera movement. This is highly suggestive that the UFOs are fakes, added in post-production, with a small glitch in their camera-tracking. There have been some claims that the work was done by Beam.TV, who have an office nearby the video you cited, but I haven't found any substantive evidence of that. 

Note: Crime statistics notoriously suffer from reporting biases - those doing the reporting are being judged on their data - which may make it more difficult to completely trust any study in the field. 

Cubic Zirconia sits in between at around 7.5-8.5 on the Mohs scale (Ref, Wikipedia puts it at 8, but the source refers to (generic) Zirconia, and I don't know if Cubic Zirconia has the same hardness.) As Mohs Scale is based on the ability to scratch lower numbered minerals, it seems cubic zirconia can scratch glass. It would be nice to get experimental confirmation of this theory, but I was unable to find any evidence (e.g. videos) of people actually trying it. For other faux diamonds, see some descriptions here. 

In a chapter starting on page 457, Russell attempts to skeptically evaluate the claims. He finds several challenges including: 

Conclusion No matter what her earlier views, by the time World War II began, Eleanor Roosevelt was a vocal supporter of the Jewish people, and continued to act openly and behind the scenes in their aid, up until her death. That doesn't prove she never made such an argument, but it is clear that the argument wasn't consistent with her sustained actions and public opinions. 

The question has also come up on BodyBuilding Forum. Does eating seedless fruit cause infertility in humans? 

In October 2013, on My 2 Crazy Curls, a blogger from Richmond, VA, reported receiving a letter from her child's preschool, explicitly banning students from bringing their own food to school without a medical reason. 

I'll take their word for it, but irrelevant to the argument (except to explain why there is a motivation to start flouridating water.) 

That research confirms the basis of the technology, but not that it works in a set of glasses. But these researchers are from Flinders University (in Adelaide, South Australia), and so is my BSc degree, so clearly their claims are completely correct! It is the Flinders way! But if you insist on wasting everyone's time by checking that these results have been reproduced independently... 

I propose to let someone else address the debunking of Kirlian photography as a method of capturing images of souls. I will address the second part: This image was NOT taken by Korotkov. This is a stock image that has been (accidentally?) attached to the story. The original was produced by Oscar Buriel as part of a larger series. 

No, it is not true that "no-one batted an eye". An independent review by the Office of Government Ethics warned about conflicts of interest, and both John Kerry and Teresa Heinz Kerry responded by divesting some investments. Kerry also pledged to avoid participating in topics that had a risk of conflicts of interest. 

Is there evidence for soap helping with cramps? I searched for treatments of nocturnal leg cramps. I found lots of anecdotal claims about the soap remedy, confirming it is a notable claim, but no studies despite there being literature reviews and meta-analyses out there.. Most of the treatments were for stretching, or ingesting drugs such as quinine, magnesium, vitamin B, vitamin E and other drugs. I note that Vitamin E is the ingredient of some soaps, but I do not believe it is volatile (a relatively large molecule with a 205°C boiling point) and there is no way someone could inhale, through a mattress, the dosages tested (400-800 IU is about 260-800mg, depending on the type of Vitamin E) Is it just Placebo Response? So, I set out to see if there was any evidence that nocturnal leg cramps responded well to placebo treatments. If they did, we could more easily dismiss the soap-user's anecdotes as the placebo effect. I found somewhat mixed results: 

You ask about IQ, but a closely related question is even more commonly found - that men show greater variance in the distribution of their mathematics skills than women. I am hoping that, with only a slight wave of the hand, you will consider an answer in this area to be highly relevant. 

The first issue is they did not test the skills of Mormons at this task. They only tested the skill of non-Mormons! 

So, the first paper provides some evidence that UV lights on dryers help, but there are reasons to wait for more conclusive evidence. 

This paper does not attempt to "answer the question whether antisocial behavior can be elicited under hypnosis". However, it demonstrates that previous experiments suggesting they could were flawed, due to lack of controls. That is the control groups were also likely to reach into pick up (apparently) dangerous snakes or throw 'acid' in people's faces, if they were subject to equivalent social pressures. 

Although Google says the word "cheese" appears inside the article, it isn't clear whether cheese was tested. 

[This is currently only a partial answer, in that addresses only one of the multiple claims. Feel free to steal it for your own fuller answer.] The Kennesaw, Georgia Code of Ordinances currently does contain this law. Article II, Section 34-21 

No, Aloe Vera doesn't help prevent or heal sunburn. I have to admit to being surprised by this. I was expecting to see a (small) effect. 

It is difficult to give a single answer to this, as there are many techniques, and any one of them might be much better than the others. It may make a difference whether these skills are discovered by experience, trained or come naturally to the individual. There are also a lot of different measures by which time management skills could be measured (e.g. quality of work, timeliness of work, productivity per hour, reliability of productivity, stress, job satisfaction, etc.) and a lot of different fields (manufacturing, software development, creative writing, retail, etc.). Here are some pertinent results. Good Time Management helps college students 

TL;DR: This site shows no evidence for the paranormal, and indeed is careful not to explicitly claim it exists. What is described could be largely explained by known psychological theories and coincidence. 

The primary source for the debunking of the Q-Link products (which was the example cited in the question) seems to have been an investigation by Bad Science's Ben Goldacre. He opened one up to reveal the electronics inside were non-functional (i.e. just zero-ohm resistor, not connected to anything). Meanwhile, Respectful Insolence's Orac looked at the so-called scientific evidence behind the Q-Link, and showed it was lacking any substance. 

It's complicated There are many different ways of modelling the cost of tobacco to society, depending on what figures are included or excluded from the total amount. For example, Devine's described model appears to have a goal of minimising only the per person cost of health care. This is self-evidently a poor choice of metric, as it justifies absurd behaviours - like letting people die quickly - or even encouraging them to die - once they get past child-bearing age. Some of the more substantive models, such as one I will introduce below, include the costs of losses of trained workforce labour, the costs of hiring people to support the incapacitated, the cost of increased fires and even the cost of the tobacco itself (which is not spent on other industries). They consider the costs to households, businesses and governments. This is not even include the intangibles, such as Disability-Adjusted-Life-Years (DALY) lost to smokers and the cost to their families of their early deaths. Also different countries have different pension and health care models, so the research must be used with care. I have only provided a selection here - the full answer could fill a book. Finland 

This study looked at 319 healthy women (who were "predominately older, married, Caucasian, college graduates in a moderate- to high-income group, who delivered vaginally", so not terrible diverse). 

Looking at the structure of the article, it starts by mentioning a study, and then it jumps to some advice and recipes from an unrelated nutritionist. To my eye, it doesn't even appear as though the nutritionist is responding to the study. So what did the study say? I confess, I didn't read it. But I found the press release (which tend to be much closer to the original study than reports on science in a cookbook daily newspaper, but could still contain misleading information.) The press release was from March 2010, and talks about an upcoming publication in the International Journal of Obesity. 

The answer is complex. There have been a number of apparently contradictory studies in the area. Researchers have been trying to dig down and find the true factors. E.g. Is generosity to charities affected by the religion of the donor, the religiosity of the donor, the frequency of church attendance, or perhaps the number of opportunities the donor is offered (e.g. in church)? If you only consider secular charities, do the relations still hold? Are they universal or by country? There is an entire section (page 6) dedicated to summarising the results in A Literature Review of Empirical Studies of Philanthropy: Eight Mechanisms That Drive Charitable Giving. Spoiler: Religion is not one of the eight mechanisms, but it affects them. This 2007 paper does not (yet?) appear to have been peer-reviewed. It has been sponsored by the John Templeton Foundation, which has a history of sponsoring controversial pro-religious studies. Nonetheless, it is certainly well-referenced, and I have based this answer on it. The basic finding is:
