Duns Scotus rejects the argument because of A5 and A3. The question now is not if Duns Scotus is correct, but rather why he is not very obviously correct – how A5 and A3 could even be somewhat plausible rather than trivially wrong. If we take, for example, a match and a matchbox and strike the match against the side of the matchbox, fire is produced. But why should we assume that the “form of fire” (if we grant the existence of such a form) is in actuality somewhere “on” the matchbox (or anywhere else)? Can somebody give some explanation why one should not immediately discard A5 and A3? How could one regard them as reasonable? 

What were Descartes' views on species? Did he ever say something about this subject? Was it more like the Aristotelian conception of immutable “groups” (without the metaphysical Aristotelian concept of natural kinds, of course) or did he envision some sort of change and contingency (evolution) of species, which would have been in conflict with the very special role humans occupy in his philosophy? I tried to research it myself, but didn't find anything. It would be best to go through the whole corpus of Descartes, of course, but I'm still occupied with reading Aristotle. Some hints would be much appreciated. 

1) Antonio Negri is probably the person that has most radically built on Marxist thought in a way that attempts to explore the philosophical implications of the changes the world has seen since the 19th century. Part of what's most radical about his project has been the de-Hegelianization of Marx's thought with him. His is probably the most profound reengagement Marx's work since Althusser. 2) David Harvey is a geographer by profession but is one of the most renown contemporary Marxists that attempts to analyze the world today from a Marxist lense. He isn't a philosopher so his language and work would likely be more "accessible" than that of Negri who is a bit more difficult to digest if you're not familiar with others that have heavily influenced him, like Spinoza. 3) Terry Eagleton & Frederic Jameson might be good to look at as well as they both approach contemporary Marxism from its cultural aspects as opposed to the economics side that Harvey would be more versed in or the philosophical that Negri would be the best source on. Jacques Ranciere might also be considered in this category, but Ranciere is a fairly adept philosopher. 4) Surrounding Negri are other Marxist theorists that are interesting in their own right: Yann Mouliere Boutang is an economist by profession who's specialty these days are understanding the cutting edge of capitalist development from a Marxist standpoint (that is to say, to analyze the political implication of the broad scale evolutions of Capital); and Christian Marazzi is similar to Boutang, but focuses more on the financial/monetary side of exploring contemporary capitalism and the political and philosophical implications of things like wage relations/exploitation etc. 5) Etienne Balibar since the 1960's has been cranking out analyses of Marx's work and attempting to reinterpret his questions and methodology in novel ways. He is not a very flashy philosopher but he is very thorough and thoughtful. He engages with the same types of subjects as a Badiou or Zizek but he's keeps the discussion at much more practical level. 

Why is the third man argument in Plato's Parmenides seen as a more or less decisive refutation of Platonic realism (Plato's theory of forms)? The argument rests on the assumption that self-predication of a form must not be allowed. But why is self-partaking (a form partakes of itself) seen as so unacceptable? 

There's a similar problem with rationality in general (reasoning with abstract concepts), but this is more complex. And, of course, qualia (which is also very threatening for materialism, but even a denial of qualia – that is qualitative, subjective experience – isn't that extremely costly as a denial of intentionality, which dissolves the meaning of truth itself). 

he misses the point because he just asserts, without any explanation, that the problem of reducing subjective consciousness to what's going on in the objectively observable brain (the “hard problem of consciousness” as philosopher of mind David Chalmers called it) is not at all different than reducing the complex behavior of weather to the fundamental physical laws and interactions between gas molecules – which are both objective phenomena. 

For Epicurus, the problem with the fear of death is the same as with any other sort of fear for him. It is firstly an obstacle to knowledge. One has to remember that he grounds his Ethics with a Physics. He's interested in things as they are as that helps us live the good life. To obtain knowledge one has to look for adequate causes of phenomena, not fear phenomena. And the knowledge isn't just for mental consolation purposes but to know how to deal with it. If one doesn't know how to swim, we see water and immediately sense fear, because that water presents a danger to us. Adequate knowledge allows us however to understand our relations with water and with practice we can come to work with it, to learn to swim. Fear is contrasted to learning, to curiosity. It's recoiling, as opposed to a careful "working-with". The second problem of fear (in general) is that it is the single greatest cause of man's misery (under the guise of anxiety). This constant fretting over future "what-ifs". So if one has as the central purpose of one's philosophy, showing man how to attain ataraxia (true equanimous happiness), one must attack fearful dispositions head-on. Death is not a special category in this framework, but a central component, treated in the same way as one treated the fear of Gods. Fear of death comes from 1) our relationship with our infinite capacity for desire, and 2) improper understanding (superstitious understanding) of the natural phenomena of death. It is, for him, only through working with natural understanding of ourselves and of life that we learn to pare down desire, make it come into alignment with knowledge of the universe and eliminate the fear of death. Without that one doesn't experience true life-pleasure or true happiness. 

It may be unnecessary or rather it has achieved all of its goals. Feminism rarely concerns itself with legal rights anymore – because in Western democracies there are no civil rights that women lack and men have. But it's not an oxymoron. It maybe could become an oxymoron if you define feminism as a “fighting against social norms that oppress women” – but in this case your slavery-analogy isn't very illuminating. Abolitionism was overwhelmingly about legal rights, not about oppressive social norms. 

1 though what Dawkins describes as "grandeur" and "beauty", to me just seems the unimaginably hugeness, complexity and scariness of the universe. 2 Alex Rosenberg: "The Atheist's Guide to Reality: Enjoying Life without Illusions" 3 for example, see Richard Dawkins & Steven Pinker: "Is science killing the soul?", Edge 1999 

Assumption as in blind faith? No. But “assumption” that we need rational insight beyond formal proofs, yes. The “assumption” that the axiom systems lack internal contradiction (= one is able to derive both a theorem and its negation from the axioms) is usually necessary for mathematics. That would be the easy answer. More difficult is the question of applied mathematics, because mathematics is obviously applied directly in many cases, not just as a tool of a clearly empirical science like physics. If we put together 1 l of a blue chemical and 1 l of a red chemical and create a purple mixture, mathematics can't tell us, of course, that we will get 2 l of purple mixture. But the curious thing is that if we do get, say, 1.8 l of purple mixture, we don't shrug it off like “Well, mathematics doesn't have anything to do with reality anyway!”, no, we look for an explanation, like a chemical reaction or physical causes, for this “abnormal behavior”. The usual mathematical operations, from +, -, /, * to differentiation & integration, seem to mirror an abstract “ideal behavior” of the real world, and that's something that can't be justified empirically. But for somebody to call this blind faith he must have developed a strong allergy to anything that looks a bit like rationalism. 

To me there's zero need to have hypercomplex definitions of these things as that's often used to obfuscate the underlying ideas and replace them with particular iterations or particular conceptions as though they somehow foreclose the human capacity to think anew. There are as many past, present and possible iterations of democracies as there are of communisms. 

To understand extension I do not believe you need to understand his idea of geometric being (or objects as conceived geometrically). Geometric being would be an attribute as perceived by intellect or mind, as a mental aid in measure. Or to use his terminology, as an "imagining" and not a comprehension (understanding the composition of relations constituting a body). Thus one is not in the same plane of discussion as with simple bodies in extension. One would be thinking in images of existence instead of being in relation to the existent. It sounds minor but he wrests a lot on establishing a sort of isomorphic non-causal interaction between these two separate planes of modality. He wrestles the most and fleshes out his thinking on this topic mostly in the Treatise on the Intellect. Anyhow, starting from the beginning of the Ethics: If: Proposition 1 establishes that God thinks; and Proposition 2 establishes that God exists in extension. then, this parallelism runs throughout all attributes of substance. Bodies exist. Thinking exists. All deriving from God as modes of extension and modes of thinking. And more importantly, this parallelism exists in complex relationships of reciprocity (e.g. "The mind is therefore the idea of the corresponding body" Book II Prop 11) All bodies thus refer to the other finite existing modes that determines it. Put another way, all extension is determined by its extensive parts/relations. Any type of body presupposes an existence which exists in extension and which can be affected by and can affect other bodies. I think there is the extent to which he postulates on the quality of extension-in-and-of-itself. The Kelvin knot type of idea is interesting but I don't think he would see that type of qualification as necessary for defining the essential character of extensionality, which he aligned more to the idea of Power of action (i.e. what it could do in affectus, affectio or essence). Measures (such as geometrization), numbers, signs, images are all occurring in mind or thinking, not in extension itself. 

On the other hand, I believe that "spiritual materialism (physicalism)" rests on a confusion. If we accept materialism, we have broadly two options. 

A reductio ad absurdum is a correct way to argue. An argument by lack of imagination is an informal fallacy. But if a reductio ad absurdum is applied outside of a highly formalized setting like mathematics, how do we distinguish it from an argument by lack of imagination? Isn't stating that something is absurd the same as stating that you can't imagine it to be true? 

In the case of mathematics it's easier to answer than in the case of physics. With simple questions like if there is a non-linear function f: ℝ → ℝ, for which f(a + b) = f(a) + f(b) for all a, b ∈ ℝ, we already dive into foundational issues which demand an answer and are connected to philosophical considerations. At this point, even someone with highly developed mathematical intuitions really starts to struggle, as expressed by the following (all-too-true) joke of Jerry Bona: 

No, because “property rights” is a broad term. It doesn't mean that you have to be an anarcho-capitalist to believe in property rights (though anarcho-capitalists would disagree, of course). There can be a constitutional right that the state is only allowed to interfere with your property by levying taxes on your income and has to accept payment in the legal tender – which would prohibit the state from confiscating your “precious” (in the words of Gollum). This would be considered “property rights” (though in practice, property rights are narrower; e.g. “eminent domain” etc.). Now, should anarcho-capitalists move out into the woods? That doesn't really help, they are still subject to the state's laws, which conflict with the anarcho-capitalist conception of property rights (any restriction of hunting on unowned land is illegitimate for the anarcho-capitalist), and, theoretically, taxes. They probably have to move to a true no-mans-land, like Antarctica. 

Within the same "in-carnation" (the taking on of flesh) there is the birth and death of particular types of minds or personalities. One is conscious of each new incarnation in this concept of the reincarnated and thus would not necessitate amnesia. If one has a concept of reincarnation that implies a physical dying and being born as a same self in a new body, there may be quite a few other things that would need to be explained before we even got to the issue of absence of memory of previous lives. 

So what distinguishes these types occurrences are both degree of existence (think intensities of existence) of the site and the appearance of something previously inexistent at the site. He defines degree as ‘measures’ of identities, differences or existences relative to a determinate world. 

Investments (of which the investment of time and resources into research is an example) of any sort are weighed on two things generally: risk and opportunity. Taboo is relevant only insofar as it MIGHT open risks to which the investor may have to account for. When an investor sees opportunity outweighing risk (e.g. likelihood of a significant finding or development), the decision tends to make itself. If someone is interested in taboo for the sake of taboo but not for a weighted probability for reward, there tends to be no motive for an investor to place resources towards that. The key in is always in demonstrating a solid basis, logic and grounding for the research. 

The final conclusion is certainly in the last paragraph, the first and second paragraph are intermediate conclusions. This is because there is some tacit (weakly supported) inference made to get to the the assertions in the last paragraph. Let's assume the authors of “After Tobacco: What Would Happen If Americans Stopped Smoking?” really did a careful analysis1, we still have non-healthcare costs, that is increased burden for social security by longer life expectancy. Those costs may very well outweigh increased productivity and saved healthcare costs. It's a ghoulish argument, but that doesn't make it wrong. 

– can we interpret “The Stadium” so that it is not trivially fallacious? That it reaches a paradoxical conclusion with the same implicit metaphysical assumptions as his other paradoxes? PS: Okay this question keeps getting misunderstood. Again, please note: The question is NOT if Zeno assumed atomistic time and space here (there is no evidence for that, anyway!). The question is, how “The Stadium” can reach a paradoxical conclusion WITHOUT assuming atomistic time and space. 

simple “not existing but contingently so”, like a full size replica of the Eiffel tower made of plastic 

While the statement of the subject can be easily indexed according to Lacan and is fairly predictable like any other object, the subject of the enunciation is by nature multiplicitous. 

Part of Marx's legacy was the realization that identity need not be passive. The International Workers movement he helped to fomented was perhaps the largest secular transnational identity formations on the planet. One need not be passive (or reactive) in the face of identity. We have the capacity to forge new ones, based on new lines in the sand, the communities we seek to establish. What he was fully aware of that perhaps many of his followers weren't was just the extent to which the politics of identity needed to be a continual struggle or effort if they were to succeed. And not as something separate from politics in general, but as a central feature insofar as it is a type of branding on individuals who can either be supporters or who can take on an opposing identity of the enemy of what you represent. 

The example you give comes from political philosophy. But who can deny that political philosophy is relevant? Who can claim that Locke or Marx were not enormously influential? And they are surely examples of careful reasoning. Historically, political philosophy mainly worked through convincing the elites, which in turn influenced the masses. Change coming from the masses itself rarely had something to do with political philosophy, it was caused by empirical data which had discredited the elites. Now, if users on this site boringly demolish a mind-blowingly stupid slogan, I think that this is relevant to real life, because it is some tiny, tiny step to get get away from this disdainful view about the masses. It hopefully inoculated those 32K viewers against one of the most extreme examples of stupid thinking in the public discourse and in turn may raise the level of debate. 

But chewing gum looks strikingly parallel to masturbation. It even decreases appetite, like masturbation temporarily reduces sexual tension. The digestive system prepares for food, but no food is taken. The reproductive system of a solitary masturbating woman prepares for heterosexual intercourse (or so claims Feser), but in the end, no man has sex with her. So to finally get to the question: In the article, is the differentiation between “contrary to” and “other than” really meaningful? If yes, then how exactly should we understand it? If not, can you go into more details how and why the reasoning here became fallacious? PS: I'm genuinely just trying to understand how people manage to reach such strange conclusions – no intentions to make this an “am I right?” post.
