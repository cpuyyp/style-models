I have a field $L$ and two field automorphisms $f, g: L \to L$ such that $f \circ g = g \circ f$. Under what conditions can they be extended to automorphisms of an extension $K \mid L$ that still commute? In particular they can certainly be extended to automorphisms of the algebraic clousure $K = \overline L$, but can they be extended to a pair of commuting automorphisms? 

Can the non-degeneracy of the bilinear form be proved by purely combinatorial methods, without appealing to Borel's theorem? Can it be extended to all pairs $(G,H)$ where $G$ is just a finite Coxeter group? 

Let $Y$ be a projective scheme. The naive definition of a Hilbert scheme of subschemes $X$ of $Y$ would require us to projectively embed $Y$, then ask that $X$ have a fixed Hilbert polynomial $p$. However, this space is usually disconnected. Cheap example: $Y$ is two points, $p=1$, and the Hilbert scheme is $Y$ itself. More expensive example: $Y = {\mathbb P}^1 \times {\mathbb P}^1$ in the Segre embedding, $p(d) = d+1$. Then $X$ is a line from one of the two rulings, so this naive Hilbert scheme is a disjoint union of two $\mathbb P^1$s. If $F\to X$ is a flat family of subschemes of $Y$, i.e. $F \subseteq Y\times X$, then the class in $K_\bullet(Y)$ of a fiber -is- isn't locally constant on $X$. (EDIT: Oops! Jason Starr suggests a related invariant that is, in a comment.) So the proper definition of "the Hilbert scheme of subschemes of $Y$" should include "with fixed $K$-class $p \in K_\bullet(Y)$". (If $Y$ is projective space, the $K$-class is exactly the same data as the Hilbert polynomial.) This finer invariant suffices to break apart the disconnected spaces in the examples above. I presume that, in general, fixing the $K$-class is not enough to get a connected Hilbert scheme. (Certainly Hartshorne's proof of connectivity in the case $Y={\mathbb P}^n$ does not go through, as it uses a big group action.) 

Both are instances of a more general version of Baer's criterion for Grothendieck categories with a family of generators [which I've seen mentioned yet never found a proof], but I haven't been able to adapt this to the general context. 

The Bass-Papp theorem states that $R$ is left noetherian if and only if the direct sum of an arbitrary family of injective left $R$-modules is again injective, so noetherian rings have the property I am looking for, but I was wondering if the fact that every injective is $\Sigma$-injective is equivalent to some classical ring-theoretical property. 

What I'm writing here seems more like a contribution to a big-list than an "answer", but since you've already chosen one anyway... Say you're interested in which irreps $V_\nu$ occur in $V_\lambda \otimes V_\mu$. Let $C$ be the set of triples $(\lambda,\mu,\nu)$ for which this is true, a subset of $($the dominant weights$)^3$. Theorem: $C$ is closed under addition. The only proof I know is this: $(\lambda,\mu,\nu)$ is in $C$ iff the line bundle ${\mathcal L}_\lambda \boxtimes {\mathcal L}_\mu \boxtimes {\mathcal L}_\nu^*$ over $(G/B)^3$ has a nonzero $G$-invariant section. Given two nonzero sections for two different triples, we can tensor them together, and the result will still be nonzero because $(G/B)^3$ is reduced and irreducible. Hence the sum of the triples is again in $C$. 

Let $H$ be a Hopf algebra and $A$ an $H$-comodule algebra; denote by $M^H_A$ the category of right $(H,A)$-Hopf modules [i.e. $A$-module, $H$-comodules, everything is compatible with everything else]. I would like to know if there is an analogue of Baer's criterion for the category $M^H_A$; in other words, 

The problem is easier to solve if we think of the grain as a fluid and apply, say, Pascal's principle. 

Short version: if $G$ is a Coxeter group and $H \subset G$ is a parabolic subgroup, both acting on a space $V$, is it true that the invariant-coinvariant algebra $(S(V)_G)^H$ has a natural bilinear form induced by taking coefficients in the top component? Now the long, detailed version. Let $G$ be a Coxeter group acting on a real vector space $V$ with a fixed generating set of reflections $S$. We can form the symmetric algebra $S(V)$, the invariant subalgebra $S(V)^G \subset S(V)$, and the ideal $I_G \subset S(V)$ generated by elements of $S(V)^G$ of positive degree. The coinvariant algebra is defined as $S(V)_G = S(V)/I_G$. By the Cehvalley-Shephard-Todd theorem it is isomorphic to the regular representation of $G$ as a $G$-module. If $H \subset G$ is a parabolic subgroup then the $H$-invariants $(S(V)_G)^H$ form a subalgebra of $S(V)_G$, which is finite dimensional and whose top nonzero component is $1$-dimensional over $\mathbb R$, say spanned by $s$. Then $(S(V)_G)^H$ has a nice bilinear pairing given by taking $(f,g)$ to be the coefficient of $s$ in the product $fg$ for all $f, g \in (S(V)_G)^H$. If $G$ is a Weyl group, the algebra $(S(V)_G)^H$ is isomorphic to the cohomology ring of a generalized flag variety by a famous theorem of Borel. Plus the bilinear form described above is the pullback of the Poincaré pairing in said cohomology, and in particular it is nondegenerate. Questions: 

The answer to the first question is no. David Vogan gave me the example of $(Sp(4),GL(4))$, orbits #46 and #76 according to the Atlas numbering here: $URL$ Axel Hultman gave me the example of $D_4$ with generators $a,b,c,d$; $d$ being the non-leaf in the diagram, and ordinary involutions. Then, $abcdcba$ covers $abc$. 

This is certainly $\bf false$, e.g. $A = {\mathbb F}_p$, $B = A[x]$, and $f=x^p$. There $B\otimes_A B\to B$ is $A[x_1,x_2] \mapsto A[x]$, with $I = \langle x_1 -x_2\rangle \ni x_1^p - x_2^p = f\otimes 1 - 1\otimes f$. (That is, not only is $f\otimes 1 - 1\otimes f$ in $I^2$, it's in $I^p$.) 

I have been looking for a couple of days for the answer to this question to no avail. Let me define what $\Sigma$-injective is. 

These "obvious morphism" come from the following setup: By 2 we may replace $R^\bullet$ with a bounded complex $I^\bullet$ such that each $I^i$ is injective as left and right $A$-module (but not necessarily as bimodule). Thus for every complex of left $A$-modules $M^\bullet$ there is a map, defined at the level of chain complexes \begin{align*} M^\bullet \to Hom_{A^\circ}(Hom_A(M^\bullet, I^\bullet), I^\bullet) \end{align*} given by simple evaluation. Passing to the derived category, the complex on the r.h.s. is isomorphic to $\mathcal R Hom_{A^\circ}(\mathcal R Hom_{A}(M^\bullet, R^\bullet), R^\bullet)$. Putting $M^\bullet = A$ gives us the morphism of point 3 of the above definition (if $M^\bullet$ is a complex of bimodules then the map respects this structure), and in the paper Yekutieli proves that this map is an isomorphism for $A$ if and only if it is an isomorphism whenever $M^\bullet$ is a bounded complex with finitely generated cohomology modules. So far, so good. Dualizing complexes, when they exists, are not unique. In order to fix a special class of isomorphisms Yekutieli introduces local cohomology. Set $\Gamma_m(-) = \varinjlim Hom_A(A/A_{\geq n},-)$, where $A_{\geq n}$ denotes the ideal of elements of $A$ of degree at least $n$. This is a left exact functor, with a right derived functor $\mathcal R \Gamma_m$ defined over left bounded complexes of left $A$-modules. Then he states that there is a map similar to that above, \begin{align*} \mathcal R \Gamma_m(M^\bullet) \to \mathcal R Hom_{A^\circ}(\mathcal R Hom_{A}(M^\bullet, R^\bullet), \mathcal R \Gamma_m(R^\bullet)) \end{align*} It is this map I am trying to make sense of. By looking at it simply at the level of complexes, we might feel tempted to replace $M^\bullet$ by an injective resolution $J^\bullet$, reuse our old resolution of $R^\bullet$ called $I^\bullet$, and thus obtain a map \begin{align*} \Gamma_m(J^\bullet) \to Hom_{A^\circ}(Hom_{A}(J^\bullet, I^\bullet), \mathcal \Gamma_m(I^\bullet)) \end{align*} given again by evaluation. This is indeed well-defined, but the problem is that passing to the derived category, it is not immediate, at least to me, that the complex on the r.h.s. is isomorphic to $\mathcal R Hom_{A^\circ}(\mathcal R Hom_{A}(M^\bullet, R^\bullet), \mathcal R \Gamma_m(R^\bullet))$. In order for that to happen, $\Gamma_m(I^\bullet)$ should consist of $A$-module which are injective as right $A$-modules, and I see no reason for that to be true (in the article it is proven that these modules are injective as left $A$-modules). Any ideas on how to fix this? Have I made a mistake with the definition of this last morphism? 

It's slightly nicer to look at $M_n // U_-$ instead of $GL(n) // U_-$, since then we're looking at a subring of invariants inside a polynomial ring. Namely, the subring generated by all determinants that use any $k$ rows and the left $k$ columns (for all $k=1,\ldots,n$); there are $2^n-1$ choices of row set. These Plücker coordinates form a SAGBI basis for this ring, making it easy to write down a basis for each $T\times T$-weight space, in bijection with the relevant Gel$'$fand-Cetlin patterns. (Specifically, there are $2^n-1$ patterns consisting of only $0,1$, which are in obvious bijection with the Plücker coordinates. Then any pattern is canonically (though not uniquely) a sum of these basic patterns, suggesting the corresponding monomial.) This is in Miller and Sturmfels' "Combinatorial Commutative Algebra", chapter 14. 

I am reading A. Yekutieli's original article on dualizing complexes for noncommutative algebras and I found a problem I cannot solve. First, some background. We start with a field $k$ and a noetherian $\mathbb N$-graded algebra $A$ and assume that $A_0 = k$. All objects are graded, and we write $\mathcal A$ for the category of graded $A$-bimodules. A dualizing complex is an object $R^\bullet$ in the derived category $\mathcal D(\mathcal A)$ satisfying the following: 

In [Hartshorne, III.3] he proves that injective modules over $R$ give flasque sheaves over $Spec\ R$. I presume that's because they don't give injective sheaves, and flasque is the consolation prize. Is there an easy counterexample? EDIT: in III.3 he's assuming Noetherian. And he's already proved in II.5.5 the equivalence of categories of $R$-modules and quasicoherent ${\mathcal O}_{Spec\ R}$-modules. (And that injective sheaves are flasque, in III.2.) EDIT: his proof that injectives are flasque uses some non-quasicoherent sheaves. So the ingredients "injective R-modules give injective objects in the category of quasicoherent sheaves [II.5.5]" plus "injective objects in the category of sheaves are flasque [III.2]" isn't enough for the result he gets in III.3, that injective R-modules give flasque sheaves. 

The skew-field of quaternions $\mathbb H$ is isomorphic to its opposite algebra. Indeed, by a theorem of Frobenius, division algebras over the reals are isomorphic to either $\mathbb R, \mathbb C$ or $\mathbb H$. Since $\mathbb H^\mathsf{opp}$ is again a division algebra, it must be isomorphic to one of these. There are several ways to conclude: since it is four dimensional, or since it is not commutative, or since it has more than two square roots of $-1$, etc., we conclude that the only possibility is $\mathbb H \cong \mathbb H^\mathsf{opp}$. If you are only interested in Morita equivalence between these two algebras, you can do better: the Brauer group of $\mathbb R$ is isomorphic to $\mathbb Z_2$, and so all elements are of order $2$. This implies that the class of $\mathbb H$ coincides with its inverse, which is the class of $\mathbb H^{\mathsf{opp}}$. Thus $\mathbb H$ and $\mathbb H^\mathsf{opp}$ are Morita equivalent.
