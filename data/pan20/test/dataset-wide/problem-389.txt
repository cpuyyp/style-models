How can a population or civilization develop empathy to the point where they feel another beings emotion if they are only a few feet away regardless of species and even if they are familiar with the emotion or not. The only limitation is that they cannot broadcast emotions, just receive them. The level of empathy ability I am looking at is above what humans have today. More in line with strong telekinesis or telepathic abilities. 

This will only work on a cloudless, sun intensive world (maybe a desert environment). Might give you some other ideas so here it goes. Build a long corridor with collapsed hinged floors. Rig a way for light from the sun to close the floors up so people can walk through them, but near the middle or end of the corridor before a closed and locked door, a pressure plate or a sensor, however you wish to rig it, will trigger some mechanics to align mirrors and concentrate the sun rays into that long corridor. Effectively burning anyone in it. You'd have to make sure the concentration is high enough to actually burn people in seconds, as well as make sure the mechanism specially the mirrors are well protected so thieves or archaeologists can't just break them. During the night, the floors drop so nobody can go near and its a long and wide enough corridor that its very hard to spider climb the walls. Still there may be ways to circumvent the trap such as putting up artificial lights at night or slowly building a makeshift floor at night. 

Short answer: Yes, as explained much better than I could in Slarty's answer. To give a historical example: During the Viking age, people in Britain would make weak beer stronger (as, with the methods and resources available to them at the time it was difficult to brew something stronger than a modern lager) by leaving it in open barrels overnight in winter, then removing the layer of ice (clean water) that formed on top, leaving behind a stronger mix with a higher percentage of alcohol. This process was often repeated several times for a stronger brew. 

Ideally need more information about the setting. In a present-day setting, as anon has already said the only real place to find one would be a hospital or long-term facility. In a more sci-fi setting, say for example there's a VR-like leisure facility akin to a cross between the Matrix and the VR Arcade place in Minority Report. Your character could steal bodies away while their consciousnesses are plugged in, this would be easier to get away with if this kind of activity was illegal or frowned upon. Although I can't think of any scenario where you could find a still-living, unconscious body and steal them away without prompting people to search for a missing person. Maybe a drug den or similar? But then your character would have to deal with jumping into a drug-addled vessel. 

Answer: No. First of all, the attacks may or may not actually be attacks. After all, natural disasters do occur all by themselves, and really makes for some pretty good plausible deniability. Secondly, I think you're ignoring the political motivation a group could have for taking credit for a natural disaster. Take terrorist groups for instance. They could claim they have the technology to cause, or have caused, an earthquake, and threaten governments at will. The government being threatened may know whether the claims are credible, but the general public may be more fearful, uneducated, or just generally conspiracy-minded. Weather control, especially if the technology is known to the general public, could be a very effective social, political, and military tool, even if it is never really used. 

While intelligent detrivores are not impossible, it may be improbable. One way I can think of to support your idea is to have the plant life or the fauna or both, excrete waste products that are actually highly beneficial to your detrivores and chemically alters their intelligence and consciousness over time to improve and expand it. Like magic mushrooms but increases your IQ, EQ etc. Hope this gives you a germ of an idea on how to proceed. 

I am writing a story where a species undergoes devolution. Is there any scientific or plausible way to do this? The process can be instantaneous or may take ages, I do not mind which as I need to weigh my options at this stage. To be clear, the devolution I am thinking of is like taking a human being then devolving him/her to the primate stage, so lets say about as far back as Orrorin tugenensis or Paranthropus where they are in the midst of evolving from primates to Homo erectus. Please note I used human beings as an example to give context but the species undergoing devolution may not necessarily be human. Based on the answers, "devolution" does not exist so had the word in quotes to reflect this. 

I think the scope of your question is too large to be easily answered here except by essay. I recommend breaking it apart for specifics. That being said, your primary concern about the spaceo-political structure that would develop would likely be some combination of what you have listed. Take into account that all worlds/species will likely not be equally technologically advanced. That can have a profound influence on the structure that would arise in each system. Consider Earth, 19th century as an example. Most people were culturally isolated, and as such didn't have any exposure to lots of things we take for granted today. Lack of variety caused a lot of prejudice, misinformation, and unfair stereotypes of other races and cultures. There were adventurers and merchants, certainly, but most people were pretty xenophobic by nature. Goods from around the world provided ample opportunity for trade. Something common in one area would be rare and exotic in another. Think of the introduction of the banana at the 1876 World's Fair, or silk from China. I think commerce would be the driver of contact between worlds. More advanced cultures would certainly take advantage of less advanced cultures, and the desire of one world to assert dominance over another would depend on their prevailing world view. One culture may see themselves as superior, and their religion may demand they colonize and proselytize wherever they can. Another culture may be a kind of insectoid hive mind, and not want to have anything to do with other cultures. Again, commerce will be your driving factor behind the motivations of not just individual worlds, but individuals from each of the worlds. Treaties will be formed to create or secure commercial interests as waging wars across hard-to-travel interstellar boundaries will be too impractical. 

They could manufacture agricultural items such as plows and digging tools. It does not need fuel to work which they need. They can do repairs as well. Basically fulfilling the roles of blacksmiths. This of course depends on the overall technological capabilities of the surrounding communities that trade with them. They can also do assembly of machinery given the specs are available or in the overseer's memory/database. Additionally they can trade information in manufacturing and calculations as well such as how deep to dig a well given certain parameters etc. This could prove more valuable than tools. 

Ok maybe not mechs, but exosuits. Powered limbs, pressurized suit, armored protection, comms, manueveraibility via jets placed on the feet and back. The suit would have to be large though so a 1.8 meter person would probably bulk to about 2.5 to 3 meters or so (rough estimate based on eyeballing existing spacesuits). They'd be armed with grappling hooks they can throw, mini-rockets (careful of that recoil) and maybe a knife or two for close combat. Not sure how much damage they can do to a medium to heavy armored station, base or craft though since arming themselves with heavy missiles might be too cumbersome and problematic given space's physics. Mines and explosives though may be feasible. Anyway, point is, you can use exosuits and they can look more mecha if you want and if they have specialized roles then you can alter their look and feel too. 

The simplest reason would be that Angels armaments of choice (assuming typical Biblical-style angels) would typically be flaming swords. Flaming swords don't have the range to be used from above, and when used in swooping charges have the same issue a lot of cavalry weapons had - they would get stuck in your opponent as you charge past and, best case, you lose the weapon, worst case, your arm comes off at the shoulder or you get dragged from your mount (or in this case, down to the ground and out of flight). There's also the issue of maintaining momentum while flying through the air and suddenly initiating a large force impact with something you're holding, this would typically lead to an almost immediate faceplant afterwards - not exactly inspiring of angelic grace - unless the flaming sword cuts through demons with no resistance like a lightsaber. 

Probably somewhat painful, depending on how much you age. I would think the more prevailing sensation is weakness of limbs and a sense of lethargy as energy is sapped out as well and your cells, bones and body parts age prematurely. 

You can also explore the possibility of increased gravity. Creatures from a world with a high gravity would be either become smaller or larger. See this Reddit ($URL$ It really depends on how you want the outcome to be. If the stronger/higher gravity was not sudden then life would evolve to fit the environment and that would include denser bones, probably larger lungs and multiple hearts to support the body, muscle density becomes higher and would make creatures larger. I've read a few books I think it was Pip and Flynx by Alan Dean Foster (don't quote me on this) where one of his species was large and strong due to living in a higher gravity world. 

The question of inbreeding could be addressed by using programs used by zoos for breeding of captive endangered animals. Those track and optimize pairings to maximize genetic variability when specimens are rare. That could be kind of a kooky reference for the story. 

There are several things that can, and historically have, contribute[d] to the growth of a city. Just off the top of my head: 

Since they retain any human motivation they had when they were living, and can lie, I would think their use in law enforcement would be extremely limited. The police might use them to aid in an investigation, like questioning a witness. But they'd be less useful than a witness because a witness can be called into court and threatened with perjury, or complicency in a crime if they don't cooperate or tell the truth. A dead person is not susceptible to such threats, so has much less motivation to "snitch" on a fellow cohort, and more motivation to frame an unliked ex-spouse. 

Quad or more legged mechs could be used to climb up terrain that is difficult for normal or heavy off road vehicles, specially if carrying a large artillery gun or cannon. Weakness is that once a leg is shot off, speed and mobility will be reduced increasingly by the number of legs destroyed. As another option, you could have wheels attached to the legs so they gain the same speed and mobility as wheeled tanks and these can switch out to climbing legs so that they can embed themselves much better in mountain or cliff-sides. Think along the lines of climbing axes or spikes. Also if say a quad legged mech gets one or two legs destroyed, they can theoretically still move about with the wheels attached to their legs and if you are up to it, maybe put in some wheels on the under-carriage. This way you get the best of both worlds?
