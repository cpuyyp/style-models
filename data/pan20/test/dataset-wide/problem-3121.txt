Semaphore’s answer is largely, but not entirely correct. The standard Italian language is based mainly on the written language used by late-mediaeval authors like Dante and Petrarca. They wrote in Florentine as it was then spoken, but modern Florentine has moved on from this. For the example in standard Italian you write “la casa” and pronounce it as it is written /la kasa/, but in Florence and Tuscany people actually say /la hasa/. This is because Florentine has changed since the time of Dante. The standard language follows the literary language, not the spoken idiom in Florence. 

There are lots of documents in Sumerian and Akkadian with precise dates mentioned in the documents themselves. These go back well into the 3rd millennium BC. These can be converted without difficulty into Julian or Gregorian dates. But of course, all this depends on what you mean by “events”. If you include astronomical events visible on earth (eclipses, novae etc) then these can be dated down to a fraction of a second by astronomical science; this will take you back millions of years. 

The place name “Yasiph” occurs in the ancient Greek translation of the Bible (the Septuagint) in Joshua 19:29, where it stands for “Hosah” in the Hebrew text. “Hosah” and “Yasiph” are not the same name, but the Septuagint does suggest that a place called “Yasiph” did exist at the time and that the translators identified it with the Biblical “Hosah”. I am not aware that it is mentioned by Josephus. 

Look at the footnote in the linked edition. It says "[Twenty-two years is probably a scribal error.]" The "King list VI" gives the correct number "20"; see here: $URL$ 

The second "quotation" appears in substantially the same form at least twice in the Bible (Prov. 25,6-7; Luke 14,8-9). This does not mean that Cato did not say it as well, but it does raise doubts. 

I have found it now here: $URL$ (footnote 40), where someone (not Chirac himself) says that Chirac is “de ceux pour qui ‘sans l’Afrique, la France deviendrait une puissance de troisième rang’” (one of those for whom “without Africa France would become a third-rate power”). NB. "third rate" not "third world". 

This actually depends on how you define “India”. If you mean “the territory of the present-day Indian Republic” then yes, Genghis did not conquer any significant portion of “India”. But do not forget that in pre-modern times “India” included present-day Pakistan. As you can see from your map, Genghis did conquer a large part of that territory. 

Despite what is claimed in wikipedia (see Rajib's comment), actually, drāviḍa – occurs already in the Mahabharata, as is mentioned by Turner: 6632 *drāmiḍa - , dramiḍa -- , drāviḍa -- MBh., draviḍa -- m.

The Babylonians and Assyrians had several versions of a king list, at least one of which enumerated the kings from the Old Babylonian period down to the Neo-Assyrian period. There is also a much older Sumerian king list, copies of which were discovered in Neo-Assyrian sites, so it is evident that these texts were still being copied and read many centuries after the kings listed in them. So yes, the Neo-Assyrian and late Babylonian literati were very well aware of ancient kingdoms. 

The oldest texts that have been successfully deciphered are from Sumer (Southern Iraq) and Egypt. In both countries decipherable writing begins around 2700 BC. 

The answer to your question is very simple: there is no contemporary historical evidence concerning Muhammad, in the same way that there is no contemporary evidence about Jesus, Moses, the Buddha, Zoroaster etc. etc. 

The Wikipedia article to which you give the link is a bit vague. There is a better account of him here: $URL$ especially this: “The Cellon-Werke prospered, but in 1933 Eichengrün had to sell part of his share in the company to Germans of Aryan descent. In 1938 the Nazis forced him to withdraw completely from his company, and as a result he sold his firm to the Chemische Fabrik Dr. Joachim Wiernik & Co. in Berlin-Waidmannslust. Due to his reputation and influential contacts, Eichengrün remained free and continued his research at home until he was imprisoned for four months in 1943 for failing to include the statutory “Israel” as part of his name in a letter to a Reich official. In May 1944, he was deported to Theriesenstadt concentration camp until its liberation by the Red Army. He returned to Berlin after the war to continue his scientific work in private.” 

I think this is a perfectly legitimate question. The first real (that is: datable and tangible) evidence for Christianity is the report of the Roman pagan historian Tacitus about Christians in Rome at the time of Nero. Tacitus wrote his history around the year 116. 

Rabelais wrote five consecutive novels about the giants Gargantua and Pantagruel. This was between 1532 and 1564. A bit later Shakespeare wrote Henry VI part 1, 2 and 3. A thousand years earlier Sophocles wrote Oedipus the King and Oedipus at Colonnos. And some 500 years earlier Homer wrote the Iliad and the Odyssey. All of this is long before James Fenimore Cooper. 

At the time when the so-called Christian era was introduced, the mathematical concept of zero was not known in Europe. Thus, the year before AD 1 is called 1 BC. However, in modern astronomical and mathematical usage “1 BC” is called the year “0”, “2 BC” is called “-1”, “3 BC” is called “-2”, etc. If you follow this convention you can carry out normal mathematical operations with year numbers. The starting point of the Christian calendar is 1 January AD 1; this is called the “epoch” of the Christian era Julian style. The equivalent date in the Gregorian calendar is 30 December year 0 (alias 1 BC). The epoch of the Gregorian calendar is thus the equivalent of 3 January year 1 (AD 1) Julian. 

Until very recently beer was not sold in bottles or tins, but was tapped from a keg. This meant that if you wanted beer you either went to a tavern, or else you lived in a palace and had a lot of space and a lot of servants, or in a big monastery. In the middle ages beer would normally have been brewed locally, in the tavern itself, the estate or the monastery and left to ferment in a keg. 

Educated people in the European Middle Ages knew Latin and read the Roman classics. They were thus very well informed about the Roman Empire. Even uneducated people were keenly aware of the contents of the Bible (through sermons, passion plays, for example). The Roman Empire figures very prominently in the New Testament narrative (Caesar Augustus, Pontius Pilate, Give unto Caesar… etc. etc.). 

Tyler has given a very interesting long list. There is no doubt that the motive of an admiral burning his own ships to pre-empt any thought of retreat is an ancient and wide-spread narrative topos. But I think it is difficult to find any examples where it is reliably documented that this actually happened. Maybe only the story about the “Bounty”. 

The Babylonian sexagesimal system is used by Ptolemy in his Almagest (2nd century AD) and by Arabic astronomers throughout the Middle Ages. The decimal numerals were introduced from India to the Muslim World in the 9th century AD, and later from the Near East to Europe. It took a long time for the “Indian” numbers to be accepted, but eventually people realised that it is much easier to calculate using the decimal rather than the sexagesimal system, especially if you are using an abacus. That is why the latter died out (except for time-keeping, degrees of an arc, degrees of the zodiac). 

The “sacred” or “prohibited” months during which fighting is banned are Rajab, Muharram, Dhul-Qaʻdah, and Dhul- Hijjah. The fasting month (Ramadan) is not one of these. So, if the shariʻa is actually strictly implemented there will be (purely statistically) a one in eight chance that any war will take place in Ramadan. 

The identity of Xenophon’s Mespila is actually debated. Whereas early researchers took for granted that it was the same place as Nineveh, more recent studies have suggested that it is more likely to have been located in or near Mosul, and it has even been suggested that the modern name Mosul (al-Mawṣil) derives from the name Mespila. Xenophon’s actual description of the place (which you have quoted) does not contain anything that compels us to identify it with Nineveh. There is some discussion here: $URL$ 

Just to stick to the comparison of Germany and Britain: The German empire and the British empire were both constitutional monarchies, with elected parliaments, legal opposition parties, relatively free press, etc. The German emperor probably intervened more in the running of the state than the British monarch. On the other hand, Britain had much more extensive colonies than Germany with the result that a very much larger portion of the subjects of the British empire were disenfranchised than was the case wth Germany. 

Around the beginning of the Christian era there were people called “God fearers”, who were gentiles (non-Jews) who worshiped the God of the Jews, but were not circumcised and did not follow the Law of Moses. (See for example Acts 13:16 and 13:26). These “God fearers” seem to have been the prime target of Paul’s preaching. They should be seen in the context of the fad for “Oriental religions” (Mithraism, Isis-worship and the like) in the Roman Empire. 

The fact is that the Greeks and Romans did not have any knowledge of Africa south of the Sahara, so they could not have had any name for its inhabitants. 

It might be worth mentioning that “Hinduism” is an invention of British writers of the 19th century. Before the colonial period people in India defined themselves by caste (Brahmans etc.) or as devotees of a particular god (Shaiva, Vaishnava etc.). There was no concept of “Hindus” as a group in contrast to Buddhists, Jain, Muslims etc.
