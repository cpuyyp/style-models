Historians themselves are not particularly concerned with being neutral, so much as accurate and in depth. It might help to think of historians as exceptionally diligent writers of non-fiction, and they write and report on what they believe happened with what (hopefully) amounts to at least some journalistic integrity. This is the ideal case. All too frequently, however, people allow themselves to have their judgment colored by their feelings; this is when the academic community comes into play, and why it should be protected and encouraged in any free nation. When you say things like 'Hitler was insane' and 'John Wayne Gacey was a pervert', in a historical context it should be at the end of a paper containing research, or else the actual historians will pop up with 'citation required'. This process is self regulating - if someone makes a contentious statement, their professional reputation is on the line. If they don't have one of those to risk at the moment, they'd better be spot on, or else what they've done is posted the academic equivalent of an obnoxious YouTube comment - only this time their real name and credentials are written at the top. This is why peer review is a good thing. In your world, if what you want is neutral coverage, then you need free speech, freedom of the press, and an academic community willing and able to police itself - and take note that we don't necessarily always succeed on these points in the modern day. 

If computers are sufficiently advanced that a person could copy him/herself into it, the transition may not be so abrupt. Existing man machine interface technology makes it possible for the computer to "write" signals to the mind (to help the blind see; I think the most recent work is out of the U.K.). Therefore, you might not have an A/B transition; the digital self may be an extension of the whole person, thought of as a single self, and all writing back to the same brain. That common brain may be backed up so that the digital self can continue after an accident (or deliberate harm). It extends the ship problem because your not looking at a second ship made according to a shared blueprint, but really looking at piece by piece replacement. 

Alternative Stress Biochemistry Humans release endorphins when they are injured causing things like runner's high. Our stress response, however is adrenaline and cortisol making us simultaneously more aggressive and numb. Your alternate society may have evolved without natural predators (otherwise the people I suggest would try to negotiate with the tiger while it's eating them). Perhaps their stress response is seratonin and endorphins, causing them to react to stressful situations with increasing focus and improving attitude. Maybe aggression is a learned, instead of instinctive, response so that your alternate people could be capable of responding to a threat - it just wouldn't be an instinctive response. This attitude to stress might make for a people drawn to technical challenges, and be plausibly advanced. Better Empathy and Recessive Sociopathy Part of the human brain is wired to run a simulation of how other's feel in response to situations. The amount of brainpower dedicated to that function could be higher, making them much more keenly sensitive to their community. Combined with an early religion emphasis given human rights this might work. Helping with that, whatever it is that builds sociopaths could be either recessive or linked with some genetic predisposition for disease, or both, limiting the amount of damage they could do. Inherited Knowledge With a little tweaking to biology, a mother could have a neural as well as circulatory connection to her child during gestation. The mother's knowledge and understanding could be passed along during development. If you accept the hypothesis of "shirtsleeves to shirtsleeves" or "rags to rags" in three generations, at any given point in time the custodians of all our institutions are split demographically between those with the skill and ability to maintain and grow those institutions, those with the ability to maintain (but not build and grow), and those lacking even the ability to maintain. As a result, at any given time, about two thirds of our society is in some stage of decay and instability. This is also why every few generations we again flirt with tyranny and slavery, having lost the generational awareness of why these things were discarded in the first place. An alternate society like this would break that cycle and have less cause for war. They would also be very smart, which would help make them plausibly advanced technologically. 

This would take a specialized organ not only capable of generating large amounts of electrical current in various frequencies, but able to survive that current without burning up. This will not ever actually happen, and is perhaps best left to the willing suspension of disbelief. If you must have this person have a debatable, organic reason they can do this, then the organ need not necessarily be in the brain, but will likely not be very pretty wherever it shows up. It will consume massive amounts of energy during use, making the character weak and hungry frequently. During use, it will probably be quite painful, due to involvement of the surrounding nervous system and heat generation. And in all likelihood, this person has a long list of other problems due to the state of his/her DNA; this isn't evolution, it's a mutation, and in real life this can get weird. Seriously I'd just hand wave this. 

Economics works well for you whether your goals are purely humanitarian or totally opportunistic. Regardless of your final goal, you need to take advantage of economies of scale. Making currency won't work long term because of the serial numbers, so you'll have to go down to the local pawn shop and get a few pieces of ordinary gold jewelry. Duplicate them several times and sell them until you can afford a more serious gemstone, and build a website. Start shipping the gems out to those who will buy it without a certificate. Get progressively more and more expensive materials - tanzanite and so on. The box plays a less and less important role after a time. You now have a significant amount of capital which you may invest however you like. At some point you'll need to hire someone to handle your money. Do everything through shell companies and try to keep it separate from the surprising amount of diamonds and tanzanite you produced. Now you're buying and selling ideas, companies, patents and factories. From here, you will be guided strictly by whatever moral code moves you most. For myself, I like to think I would purchase patents on the most expensive medications in the world and free release them, while turning around and funding the research that those fees were paying for. This will save far more lives than duplicating or purchasing the medications themselves could. It will also give you a global platform on which to solicit charitable gifts for more good deeds. If evil and greed are your thing, pick your targets and watch them fall to the power of simply going bankrupt. If that isn't as much fun, buying "accidents" shouldn't set you back much, unless the target is very high profile. What's interesting is that the above two scenarios aren't actually mutually exclusive - nothing actually stops you from saving the masses and killing the few. It just all depends on what flavor of self-aggrandizement you are into. 

Gravity effects all things equally, and the further you are from the center of pull the more gentle and evenly distributed is the pull. So, a supermassive black hole will move the whole star system - where you are asking to move planets individually. You might be able to get away with a tiny black hole. Bear with me because this is weird - once matter goes past a critical density (about the mass of one hundred thousand super carriers squeezed into the volume of a raindrop) it has a sufficiently curved gravity to be called a black hole. As people were concerned about the possibility of tiny black holes being created by CERN, nothing rules out super dense, but not very massive, material from existing in the universe. A meteor shower of this stuff would cause a localized effect, nudging a planet it is passing nearby by while leaving the star unaffected. 

After their push into Canaan - which stopped short of full conquest because the invaders had gotten tired of killing, the new power in the region had no central government for generations. It made it impossible for the "industry standard" politics of the day - kings intermarrying with the families of kings, holding the children as hostages, and patronage through large gifts. Having no one to do business with, government-to-government, stymied most efforts for Egypt or Babylon to influence the region for generations. Have the enemy clearly declare two sets of laws 

The cataclysmic event that you describe may create a society of blind people in the short term, event though as you describe, the event changes the genome of the species so that they will no longer be able to see based on light reception. So assuming that the survivors are still able to reproduce, I think if being able to see by light perception gives a selective advantage to the future generations then it is possible that it will become the dominant trait again. However, the dynamics of how this would play out is rather difficult to predict. Theoretically speaking, many animals rely on other senses rather than sight, and it is not difficult to imagine that given time people might evolve to have more fine-tuned senses that compensate for this. If the selection pressures were such that based on this initial event the people who are able to adapt to living without being able to see (or people who are blind already) then we might expect them to become the dominant minority and so they could help to shape the future society to that which favours the blind. Therefore I would conclude that due to selection pressures being less deterministic than we might think it is, the possibility of a civilization with mostly blind people (some would argue that this is already the case) is just as likely and possibly as one that is not. 

s = 1/2 x [ (v^2) / ((A/m) sigma) + ((A/m) rho v^2)) ] Equation 2: Velocity Loss Penetrating a Layer of Material delta v^2 = [2 s (A/m) sigma] / [1 - s (A/m) rho] Equation 3: Kinetic Energy Transferred by Velocity Loss E = 1/2 m (v-new^2 - v-start^2) By the way, if this turns out to be useful, please let me know. I never finished the book because I thought I was writing for my own benefit. 

This is the plot of 'Neuromancer'. The security A.I. and the hacker A.I. were... wait, spoilers. The discipline of information security is about reducing the threat surface area. Think about it like actual surface area: limit the number of ways the outside can reach the inside. Information security specialists also perform their own periodic penetration testing, trying to identify weaknesses. It is well-known that people are the most often abused weak point, and penetration testing includes people. Additionally, information security includes imagining that someone does break in and mitigating how much damage can be done by an intruder: this includes encrypting data in transit, encrypting data on the raw disk, encrypting specific files (like layers of armor), multiple accounts with limited (the concept is called 'least privilege' and involves only having access to systems for which you have a demonstrated need-to-know) and non-overlapping privilege, and protecting accounts by only allowing logins from specific locations (like Sensitive Compartmented Information Facilities (SCIFs)) or only at specific locations, and not necessarily making every part of the system available from every other part of the system. "Erasing" a hack involves deleting or editing logs or records that recorded the attack. While the attack is ongoing, every activity on all machines is being recorded (as ridiculous as that may seem). These logs are being monitored constantly by algorithms and by people. If an intrusion is detected, the response depends on the attack vector -- if someone is trying to attack the account, disable the account; if someone is taking advantage of a computer, revoke it's trust certificates (essentially detaching the a previously trusted computer from the network); shut down the app; or, if required, shut down the whole system - some security environments include virtual machines (VMs) that are intended to be disposable in the event they appear compromised or infected, only to be rebuilt from a trusted repository - in fact, disposable VMs are one of the security concepts behind apps on cellphones. The hacker, as others stated, is looking to exploit any vulnerabilities. It could physically steal disks and work on decrypting the data. It could also exploit zero-day exploits: gaping flaws in the software environment that no one knows about yet. These may or may not avoid logging, because it's taking advantage of a gap between components. 

Looking at all the movies that involve robots made from materials available from planet earth (think Pacific Rim, Iron Man etc. but not Transformers), what is the theoretical limit of the capabilities of robots in terms of impact damage absorbed (e.g. falling off or crashing into a building). I would like to work out what the maximum height that a robot of an 'average' human size and form can fall from and not sustain any damage (i.e. within its normal operational condition), and then theorize about new technologies that can be used to improve upon the design so that it doesn't sound too far fetched. This would be based on everything that we know and perhaps forecasting around 20 years into the future. If that's too broad, then I would like to know how it is that Iron Man can survive the impact damage from falling at various heights (most times with added speed) and not suffer impact or shock damage to put it out of operation. Is the material and engineering of the suit plausible at all? 

In the Silmarillion, Tolkien indicated that the mountains were created rich with gold and gems easily accessible to the dwarves. They awoke, the Silmarillion says, from some sort of slumber in the mountains. My take on that has been that the dwarven kingdoms were more settled than mined. The vast reaches were available because Eru made them that way. Again, Eru (who made everything) made these caves for the dwarves to live in. Dwarves woke up, so the Silmarillion goes, in these caves. They could grow mushrooms without light. Sinkholes from above could bring in wood and biomass to fertilize the mushroom crops. Underground rivers and blue holes (underwater sinkholes) could route fish into the kingdom. The visualization of all the torches often makes me want to ask, 'where is the air?'. But it is a world of magic - maybe it is a magical fire that gives off light and heat without consuming fuel or oxygen. This is the dwarves natural terrain. It was, no joke, made for them and them for it. Maybe vertigo is just not something dwarves have when they feel the safety of a few million tons of rock over their heads. 

I think the 'driving' may well be mostly automated (Google will take care of that) due to the inability of humans to deal with the processing of extra spatial information, and that we will probably be wanting to text and jetpacking at the same time (which would be quite dangerous). However, this would depend on how people's attitude towards automated systems turn out in the future. An alternate and simpler solution might be the simple extension of existing traffic rules and treat it as extra roads and paths that you can only traverse in a very specific manner, in which case it is no more or less complicated than current traffic systems to design and implement. Another possibility is that traffic will be treated like how people currently solve the problem of colliding into someone else when we are walking in that there are no rules but some loose conventions. Which is to say that there will be a very simple collision detection rule that allows more complex behaviours to form which minimizes accidents. Most, if not all traffic problems are to deal with human issues. So if you can predict or anticipate human problems then you can deal with it (which is to say that we will probably never be able to).
