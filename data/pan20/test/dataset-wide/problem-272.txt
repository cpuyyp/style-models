Having done some concrete work over the years, I can tell you that it's amazingly​ labor intensive even with air hammers and gas powered saws. Things would have to be pretty bleak, post apocalypse, to make the amount of energy expended worth it... Foundations will typically be around 6 to 8 inches thick and be reinforced with rebar. Cutting or hammering through takes a lot of time and fuel even with the best tools. Basically any resources you could get by dismantling a foundation you could get much more easily by raiding a construction supply manufacturer or warehouse. Big box stores will be useful alternative in the beginning, but I would look further up the supply chain. Concrete and asphalt are heavy and shipping is obviously time sensitive, because asphalt cools and mixed concrete sets, so most cities will have their own local manufacturer. These manufacturers will usually have extraordinarily large stockpiles of both raw materials and ready to use product. Rather than dumping time, fuel, and effort into breaking, moving or otherwise recycling concrete slabs, you could put in a tiny fraction of the required resources into finding and transporting materials from the manufacturer just like we did it in the good old days before the apocalypse. 

I could see a medical and or psych degree being helpful, but I think the job would really require some level of social pathology, specifically a lack of empathy. Come to think of it... Your torturer may not need any medical background if they can work cooperatively with a medical team. Pretty much the torturer would take the victim apart and the med team would put them back together. If I'm not mistaken this is how modern "advanced interogation" is/was done... The docs put together a "program" and the underlings carry it out. As for making torture, executions, and related professionals socially acceptable... Honestly I have my doubts... Your best bet is probably going to be secrecy and anonymity. No one wants to live next door to the sociopath that fillets people for money. "Oh, me? I work on the base in, um, information gathering and asset disposal." 

So everything else being equal, temp, atmosphere, etc. could a thriving planetary ecosystem exist at say slightly above 1% normal daylight? Failing near total darkness, how dark can it be? 

It's not uncommon to see "higher level" predators gain some higher intelligence. See dolphins, wolves (pack hunters in general) It's also not uncommon to see "lower level" omnivores gain some higher intelligence. See raccoons, monkeys 

You don't need to send a modern tank to Waterloo or to The Battle of the Bulge, you just need to look for a soft target/event that preceded those battles. Don't send your time machine back to Normandy on D-day send it back to the Branau am Inn, Austria, on April 20, 1889. 

Believe it or not humans still​ have some basic maternal/paternal instincts. Very basic things like protective and nurturing instincts kick in during pregnancy even without cultural exposure. From what I've observed as a dad, women begin bonding with their offspring while they're still in the womb. Obviously some of that may be cultural, but it's kind of hard for them to ignore it when it's moving and seeming to react to certain foods, sleep cycles and so on. When you couple the physical sensations with the hormonal changes it's at least very likely to expect a somewhat typical maternal response. Even before birth. The actual birth is likely to be hard without knowing what to expect, but keep in mind that women have been delivering healthy babies into the world for a really long time. I mean we survived as a species after all. Humans were giving birth long before language or medicine. Directly after birth I strongly suspect that the young women will recognize that this is the thing that she's been getting to know for the last several months. The thing that likes tacos, but kicks her bladder if they're too spicy... The basic bonds have already been developing. Another thing to know is that, generally speaking, we arrive preprogrammed to cling and nurse. Infants will usually grab and hold on to your fingers right​ away. If the young women holds the infant close to her the infant will instinctively start feeling around for a nipple to nurse from. Once nursing, women get a rather pleasant dose of oxytocin that can reinforce the behavior and may help further develop the bond. *Disclaimer I am not a mother, nor do I pretend to know everything about that experience. I know what I've observed and what the women in my life have kindly explained to me. 

What I'm trying to say is... On a long enough timeline, no matter how many intermediaries you have, those people will be tortured into giving up the goods, you need a mechanism to prevent it from coming to that point. 

Natural obsidian is a pretty terrible substance to make a durable weapon with, but there are other "obsidian like" materials that could work. "Obsidian like" being glass with impurities... Consider: $URL$ 

I doubt that a scent map could be accurate enough, for long enough, to be viable. Think about it, most scents are somewhat impermanent: the flora will change seasonally, scent patterns will change dramatically with even a slight breeze, not to mention that even on a temporary map everything would be represented by an amorphous gradient. Represented visually a scent map might look something like this: Even if you could some how fix certain scents to certain areas, how would you differentiate things that generate the same or similar scents, say this group of pine trees from that group of pine trees? Species that use scent as a primary sense often use more of a Hansel and Gretel method, basically they leave bread crumbs or scent trails. A dog probably finds his way home by marking his path along the way. Similarly ants leave pheromone trails. Predators usually mark territory, but even then these markings are temporary and change constantly with the animals day to day movements. 

Regardless of the weapon design I doubt that you could achieve a "zero stray bullet" outcome. No matter how well designed the weapon is you still have to rely on available intelligence and tactical information. I would guess that more civilian casualties are caused by poor intel than by poor weaponry. 

The human body tends to be pretty good at rejecting foreign materials. Plant or not, often if you put something that isn't supposed to be in a human body the body will try to remove it. This is part of the body's immune response. You can see it happening with something as simple as a splinter in your finger. This can even happen with surgical implants. I had a friend who had a joint in his foot/ankle replaced with an artificial implant, his body rejected the implant and effectively tried to push it out. I've never seen anyone in so much pain... So, realistically an implanted seed could sprout inside a human body, but the real pain/torture comes when the body starts to reject the seed/plant and push it back through the tissue and skin. 

I'm going to take a different approach than most of the other answers here. Given the current trend in warfare towards hardware and away from large ground forces, I would guess that after the initial transition period, things would carry on in much the same direction that they're already moving. Modern militaries already prize mental aptitude over physical strength. Your ability to operate the technology is way more valuable than your ability to lift heavy objects... More and more combat is being conducted by drones, air power, heavy vehicles, and war ships. While infantry is still used and is still important, it's very rarely used as a front line. Even when it is, combat is rarely if ever hand to hand, it's much more finger to trigger and infantry weapons tend to get lighter and more efficient with each new generation. "How would a military staffed only with women be different?" It wouldn't be much different at all in the long run.
