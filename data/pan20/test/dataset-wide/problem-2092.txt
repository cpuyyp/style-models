Give your best estimate. Avoiding one isn't helping you, and certainly isn't helping this project manager. Project managers need estimates in order to help track the overall project. And not giving one means they have to take their own (often less informed) guess and use that. Not giving one also makes you look bad. Many find that breaking down the task into smaller chunks helps in creating an estimate. Often, smaller chunks are easier to visualize and estimate. And usually, you can ask for a little bit of time to do this analysis, rather than providing your estimate immediately. Make sure you convey that your estimate likely can't be very accurate yet, and explain the reasons why. Then, promise to give a revised estimate once the project tasks become clearer. And give her a time frame for when you will provide your next estimate. Track your estimates and actuals, so that you will get better over time. And as your project progresses, re-estimate the remainder even if not required to do so. If you feel that your original estimate isn't likely to hold, then make sure to provide feedback to the project manager as soon as you know. Project managers (all managers) don't like surprises. Then stop the dread, stress and uncomfortable feelings. These are emotions that you bring on yourself. Knowing that you are doing your best, and that it is being recognized by those about you should free you from these feelings. 

No. Your resume should reflect your knowledge and your experience. You should avoid including anything that you haven't yet experienced. It should include actual jobs you have held - not jobs you expect to hold, jobs you hope you will hold, or jobs you wish you held. You can always revise it in a month or two once your potential job actually comes to fruition. 

No. He got the job, you get the bonus. Companies provide referral bonuses so that good professionals will recommend their company to their friends and so that other good professionals can be hired. And presumably you told your friend about the job, he was interested, and ultimately hired. Your friend gets a good job at a good company. You get a bonus. 

Only the recruiter can tell you if he is offended or not. It might depend on the manner in which you told him that you "will tell him when I'm available to have a 15 min talk". For example, you might have said "I'd really like to talk with you. Let me get back to you quickly with a time that's convenient for me." And you might have sent the email that night. Or you might have said "No, you don't tell me when you're available to talk, I'll tell you when I'm available to talk." And you might have waited a week to respond. Or, he might not have received your email. Or, he might have moved on to another candidate when you weren't available to talk with him initially. Or he may not be available for a call on such short notice. Or something else. You should give him a quick call as soon as practical (and perhaps within the "today afternoon" window). When you eventually connect with him, you can ask if your email came off in a way you didn't intend. And you can asking him the status of the job in question. 

Mail from/to a company's email system is not yours - it belongs to the company (at least in the US). Also remember that even when you delete mail, it likely still exists on the corporate servers and backups. Unless someone specifically purges it, these emails will remain accessible to folks who know how to do it. This is what typically happens in the US, but the privacy rules surrounding emails vary widely by locale. 

Since you were given time to think about it, it's reasonable to indicate that after thinking about it you have decided that you would like a higher wage. You have weakened your position and made negotiation more difficult by already indicating that the offered salary was "okay". (Since you used the word "renegotiate" in the question title, it seems that you understand this.) You have signaled a tentative acceptance, and now you are undoing that. But you can still ask for more. Be prepared to discuss why you think you are worth more. Don't just indicate that you want more. Consider the entire offer package - salary, benefits, work environment, growth potential, other offers, etc. And consider the entirety of what is involved with the job - the tasks, the hours, the overtime, the on-call, etc. Also be prepared if the company believes that their offer was fair and declines to offer more. Decide ahead of time how you will respond. Next time when asked about an offer, be less definitive. Instead of saying that it is "okay", say something like "Well, it's less than I was expecting. I'll have to think it over." Saying "it sounded okay" may cause the company to harden their position, believing that you will be willing to accept the offer. Being less definitive may cause them to think about how much they will bend to meet an expected counteroffer. 

Only you can weight those factors, and determine your next move. If it was me, I'd go with your gut and ask for $60k, but your mileage may vary. 

If your boss echos the same timeline you heard from HR, you could ask "Is that a policy? Are there ways to get promoted sooner here than the timeline would indicate?" Then, be guided by how your boss responds. You might find that you are asking too soon. You might find that he isn't willing to step outside the box here. Or you might find that he has some ideas on what would make you eligible for another promotion in spite of the timeline. 

It seems like you have a third option. Depending on the depths of your ethical concerns, you can refuse to take the polygraph. If it were me, I'd just take the test, get the clearance, and see what happens down the road. May of next year is a long way away and plans can change. 

Your sense is correct - it's almost never correct to generalize the overall culture of an entire company from an action of an individual, or from one incident. Every organization makes mistakes, every company has a bad apple or two. It's only when you dig in deeper that you can see if your data point is a pattern or an outlier. 

Assuming you have control of yourself, losing your cool or not losing your cool is a choice you make. When your neighbor attempts to interrupt you next time, try something like "Hey Mr. Left, I'm really busy here, perhaps we can chat some other time?" Then simply turn away and go back to your work. This will usually work, but in some extreme cases (really clueless neighbors), you may have to go a step farther. In one particularly chatty office where I worked, folks would hang a sign on their cubicle next to the opening which said something like "Sorry, I'm busy" or "Do Not Disturb", when they didn't want to be interrupted. Then if anyone tried to interrupt, they simply ignored the offender. It worked for them - it might work for you. 

You get on the phone as soon as the business day starts today or tomorrow, call your new boss and explain what happened. You also explain that you don't yet know when you will be able to start, and explain that you will call them as soon as you do know. There is nothing tricky about this. It isn't any different than if you were already on the payroll and had to go to the hospital. 

First you need to understand the "why" behind the struggles. If you don't know that, you can't know how to help. Talk with him. Review code with him. Find out what he understands and what he doesn't. Then you can try some improvement experiments. For example, if this person is undertrained, you can provide training. If this person needs to focus, you can reduce the number of tasks on his plate. If this person needs to prioritize, you can help work on a sequential todo list. And so on. Lastly, if you conclude that person is simply not capable of accomplishing the tasks necessary, you can help this person find a more suitable role. Sometimes that is within your company, sometimes not. 

You can expect anything. Sometimes the salary range is publicly available information, and sometimes it isn't. In my experience an answer to "you fit our range" is the most you can expect in many cases until you get to the salary negotiation stage. 

In cases where extreme quiet is truly desirable in the "cubicle farm", I've typically seen two solutions. The less desirable of the two seems to be the most common. The company provides nothing special, and folks simply wander out into the common hallways to conduct their personal calls. While it isn't completely private, most people don't pay attention to the random hallway conversations between workers, or when workers are on their phones. The more desirable of the two is when the company provides sufficient small conference rooms. Because they understand that privacy is occasionally necessary in a "cubicle farm" scenario, these companies dedicate a number of 1-2 person conference rooms to small, private needs. (Often they are called "apartment offices", and are used for folks visiting from other divisions who need an office, chair, desk, and phone). Good companies have enough of these scattered throughout the buildings such that at least one is usually unoccupied at any given time. In cases where such extreme cubicle quiet isn't truly necessary (the majority of companies I have seen), people simply conduct personal calls in their cube, and try to be relatively quiet about it. (I hate cubicles. A misguided, terrible invention, in my opinion. But that's another topic for another time.) 

See the difference? You are showing your enthusiasm, an interest in the company, and are asking for something specific from Mr. CEO, rather than just generalities. Think about it, and give it a try. You could end up with a useful, ongoing conversation with Mr. CEO via email, and a great opening to talk about whenever you run into him again. 

If you don't have enough willpower to just naturally get the boring-but-necessary work done in the regular course of a day, then try scheduling. Schedule your less-desirable work at the beginning of the day, followed by your more-desirable work afterwards. That way, the eagerness to get to the good stuff will power you through the boring stuff. You'll look forward to it.
