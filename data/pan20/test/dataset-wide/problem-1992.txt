In certain circumstances it could detract from the overall look of your employment record. For example, if it somehow looks like you were unemployed and your wealthy sibling did you a favour by giving you a fake job, then that would detract from the value of this job on your resume compared with a "real" one. That's irrelevant to your case. You haven't even graduated yet so it doesn't matter whether or not you have a steady employment record. So far as the project itself is concerned, the value comes from you being able to talk about what you achieved and what you learned, not how you got the job in the first place. 

I don't think you should tell about the job, presuming that you heard about it in confidence. It is superficially attractive for authority to have a network of informers in place, and for nobody to be able to speak to anybody else in confidence where such confidence keeps information from the authority. So, one might think that one's duty to one's employer is to run straight to your boss's boss with the news. However, in practice this degrades what I'll call for want of a better word "society". Where there is no outright wrong-doing it's better in general, in the long run, for colleagues to be able to speak to each other in confidence, and by no means is it outright wrong-doing for an employee to seek and secure a new job. Betraying a confidence trades this general benefit of trust among colleagues, for a specific benefit of dealing with your boss's current BS. One result of this is that "snitches get stitches", sometimes even from the authority that they inform to, never mind their peers. It may not be right or fair, but you have to take into account that it probably won't be taken as you having done anyone a favour. If your boss was stealing from the warehouse then betraying the confidence would be not only approved of but demanded by the senior management (and the law). That would be outright wrong-doing. Despite this I do think you're entitled to call out the "F--- it attitude" and the fact that you're now doing a lot of his work, but do so in the way that you would do if you didn't know the reason behind it. It's not your job to report to the company as a whole on your boss's motivations, but it is your job to report what work you're doing. Frankly, if you're in the running to get the job, then simply mentioning that you're already doing much of the work, without making a complaint of it, probably does you no harm. So you might choose not to complain anyway, if it's to your benefit not to. Try to get enough written down, that when you're considered for the post you can say, "I already have proven experience of doing X, Y and Z required in this role". But if the workload of the two jobs combined is unmanageable, or if your boss's attitude is harming things that you can't just cover, then you're definitely entitled IMO to address the fact that your boss is severely underperforming. You don't have to provide the reason your boss has chosen to severely underperform. If this calls unwelcome attention on your boss, with the result that they somehow figure out that he's planning to leave, well, maybe he should have carried on doing his job up to the point he actually did leave. So another thing you can try is to say, in whatever words are appropriate to your relationship with your boss, "you wouldn't take this view if you weren't about to leave, and people are going to notice the sudden change. If you don't care about them finding out then would you mind just giving them the date so that we can all work towards a clean handover?". 

Depending on your company's attitude to IT, possibly you should also look for technical fixes yourself. If part of your job is to maintain the laptop then you definitely should. If you're not allowed to do anything to your laptop by your compay's IT policy then you definitely shouldn't. 

So I don't think you need to be told that your boss needs to know: the goal is merely to inform your boss in a way that your co-worker will not perceive as calling the cops on him. The first thing is to realise that this may not be possible -- if he's absolutely determined to be offended then there's no way to tell your boss and not offend your colleague. But then, that's his tough luck for (intentionally or accidentally) creating an incentive for others to conceal his errors. Next, go back to your colleague and tell him (don't ask him) that unfortunately you're not allowed to have the password he's just given you. You know this because your boss controls that password and has refused it to you in the past. So, because you now know it: either you need permission from your boss to have the password, or else the password needs to be changed. This would be the case regardless of how it was given to you. Furthermore, because it was given to you by email, most likely the password needs to be changed anyway even if you are given permission to know it. If the password in question is very low-value, and your email system is reasonably secure, then your boss might choose to accept that risk, but that would have to be due to a specific calculation. For a somewhat contrived example: if remote password login is disabled, the machine is virtual (hence has no way to login from a local terminal) and you were the one person left with access to the machine who doesn't already know the root password, there may be no immediate risk in painting the root password in 10 foot letters on the side of the building. But it's still not good general practice, so your boss might well opt not to do that! This lays out the problem, as you see it, to your colleague. Crucially, focus on the problem being "I know this thing I shouldn't know", not "you did this thing you shouldn't have done", and don't talk about blame. You could then offer two solutions: 

If they have no useful work to be doing, then I suppose so. Recognising your own chain of command, even up to C-level, is probably useful and a good idea as a matter of courtesy to their position. A UK SME (so up to 250 employees) in which you have too many people in your chain of command to recognise them all, needs to sort out its org chart with a weed whacker! In contrast, recognising everyone in the whole organisation who outranks you is often impractical, although it does no harm provided you don't waste a lot of time on it. For that matter, how should James have acted differently if he had recognised the guy? It's one thing to recognise him, it's another thing to let him into an area that he apparently (due to not knowing a door code) may not be authorised for. Given that each office has its own code, it seems natural to assume that those who don't know the code shouldn't be there, even if you do recognise them. Regarding that and other security matters, you know more than we do about the details of the event and of your office's general policies, but there are various secondary things that could have gone differently. 

Very true for those who ask a single employee, "does the company pay well?", because that employee will respond, "yes, they paid me what I deserved". But those who get their information in a more aggregated way (which of course can be really difficult: you rely either on published ranges in job ads, on company self-reporting, or on self-selecting employees willing to state salary in a survey) will just see a number, they won't see what was asked for. You can put up the numbers by giving everyone a payrise tomorrow, doesn't necessarily mean it's worth it for the reputational effect. I wonder how many companies' PR departments have ever said, "the most effective way we can use our budget is just to divide it up among the staff so that they tell their friends the company pays well" ;-) 

The picture I get is that actually they acquired you to provide engineering support for their product. The fact that in doing so they had to take on your contractual obligations appears to be treated as an unfortunate side-effect, although of course nobody turns down the money when it's due. You're overworked, especially with this extra two week job taken into consideration. Of course you want to drop the task that's least appealing to you, especially in view of the fact that there exist cheaper, trained people perfectly capable of doing it. That's not how it works though, you should drop the lowest-priority task given your company's actual situation, not the situation that it would be in if they'd taken your advice in the first place and hired that cheaper person a month ago. They chose not to replace the PCB tech (certainly not as a matter of urgency), now you and they together will deal with the consequences. So: 

Might well be true of most candidates. Apparently it wasn't true of you, though, so not "always". How many candidates actually accept the lower counter-offer and how many don't? The ones that do definitely asked for more than they were willing to accept. 

Given the situation you describe, I wouldn't worry about it either way. You've already told them that their salary range is acceptable, and therefore in particular that the low end of their salary range is acceptable. They'll make an offer accordingly, but they'd still like to know your current salary, since getting extra information from you doesn't do them any harm. And they won't necessarily offer you at the low end just because they can, since they're interesting in keeping you as well as just getting you. So, yes, let it go. If they ask again you don't have to tell them, but you also probably shouldn't assume that not telling them gives you a huge negotiating advantage compared with telling them. 

There are professional and personal consequences you have to think about. Professionally, the main thing is transfer of responsibilities. If you have no particular responsibilities, and are pretty much interchangeable with your colleagues, then there's nothing to do here. Some jobs are designed like that to allow for frequent staff turnover with minimal impact. Otherwise, this is your boss's responsibility to manage, but depending on your role you might be heavily involved in it or it might even be delegated to you. If you're telling people stuff about how to do your job when you're gone, you kind of have to let them know you're going in order to provide context for that. From what you've said it seems like your boss is completely relaxed about this and foresees no problems. You might be inclined to follow that lead. However, maybe your boss is assuming you'll start telling people quite soon, and doesn't realise that your preference is not to do it at all. You should discuss this with your boss, because it's not clear whether "it is your personal business" is really intended to take precedence over "you need to do it". If you'd prefer for your boss (not you) to make an announcement at the latest possible time, then just ask. Personally, there are likely to be people who'd prefer some sort of closure. If they know you're leaving they might stop by your desk to say goodbye, maybe exchange personal email addresses, or pay back the price of a coffee they borrowed from you 18 months ago when they forgot their wallet, never paid back, and would feel guilty about. Whatever's important to them. Furthermore, if you take a moment to say goodbye to them that's a social signal that they have meant something to you (perhaps not much, but more than nothing). So you can leave on better terms by giving people a short amount of time to do that -- perhaps a few days or even just a day, depending how easy it is to drop by and speak to you. If your workplace is generally unpleasant, and you think it will be made even more so because your colleagues are horrible to people who are leaving, then they'll despise you whether you tell them or not, and perhaps you might as well sneak out. But if you're on good terms with them and just shy about big parties and rounds of applause, you can let them know you're going but privately ask your boss (who hopefully knows this about you already) to intercept anyone trying to organise farewell cakes/speeches/whatever. This will deal with most of the people who, as you've seen in other answers, will remain civil to you after you have left only if you go through certain routine pleasantries. It's also worth bearing in mind that there are some (relatively few) workplaces where employees are walked out the door as soon as they hand in their notice. So the shock of a colleague leaving without notice clearly can be survived, but the difference from your POV between that situation and yours, is that in that situation everyone rightly puts it down to the employer's choice, and any ill-will falls on the employer. Whereas in your situation it's you who has chosen and they'll know it. So no, you don't have to unless your boss instructs you to. Maybe not even then. Alternatives are that your boss does it instead of you, or that nobody does anything. Just be aware of the consequences when you decide. 

Well, an employment contract could in theory say a lot of things, but under normal circumstances it's the company's time. Your commute is your time, but operating the equipment they supply, in the office, once you've arrived, is part of your work. If it takes 15 minutes a day to boot your laptop, or calibrate the phase angle of the proton flux, or any other time-consuming task necessary to start work using that equipment, then doing those things is work. However, beware employers who talk about "working the job, not the hours" in the context of something that you'll have to do every day forever. What this means is that, although it's the company's time, there is no upper limit to how much time is the company's, and no lower limit on how much time is yours. Therefore, supplying you with this computer is equivalent to extending your working day by 20 minutes compared with what you thought it was going to be, because they'll still expect you to get "a day's work" in. If they behave like that, then they will continue stretching your working day until you're on the edge of burnout, because they don't really believe in "your time" to begin with. So, good luck with that. Since this is taking an unreasonable amount of time compared with how long a laptop "should" take to boot, I think you have two responsibilities: 

Sounds like you were tasked with recommending the best software package. You evidently weren't tasked with choosing which product to use, even if that's what you thought the task was, because that wasn't what you were allowed to do! The CEO has other priorities than you. For example, she doesn't care whether the app is written in a hodgepodge of Delphi and .NET, or in pure, crystalline, beautiful Haskell. She doesn't care whether she's met the developers or not. She doesn't necessarily want to choose the "best" product technically. Whereas you don't care what your competitor uses. So if you want to pursue the issue, you should seek to find out what her criteria are for choosing a product. If they are different from the criteria that you used to make your recommendation, then you've learned something about the company's approach to doing business. If they're different from what you were asked to use as your criteria, then you've learned something about what kinds of expertise you're asked to contribute vs. what kind of expertise the CEO prefers to provide for herself. If the CEO's decision still seems wrong even once you know her criteria, then you can ask to present again, addressing the specific deficiencies that you feel she's overlooked. It's possible that the CEO's criteria are completely misguided. For example, someone might have as a criterion "purchase price must be less than X", overlooking that if the cheap product is hard to use then they'll pay more for it anyway in training and operator errors. Then you'd counter that by quantifying the hidden costs. Or someone might think, "I'm not using anything written in Delphi" and end up overlooking the best product because they rejected it first thing and never assessed it properly. You'd counter that by going through the assessment and showing that Delphi is a red herring (heck, surely part of the point of a cloud service is that they could rewrite it in Delphi any time they like, but this wouldn't affect you). Someone might think, "if it works for our competitor it'll work for us", not knowing that the competitor is preparing to finally dump the rubbish product they've been tied into for years, in favour of a better one. Arguing that the criteria were wrong is different from arguing which product best meets the criteria, so you need to know the real requirements if you're to do anything other than repeat the opinion that your CEO has already seen you present. The real requirements include more than just use cases. But the CEO might not want to share the full picture with you -- if that was the plan all along then she'd have delegated the decision, not asked you to present to her for her to decide. If she's left you frustrated that your effort and expertise weren't appreciated then that's a pity, because that probably didn't need to happen, but just because it should have been explicit that you were only assessing one aspect of the decision doesn't mean she's going to change the decision. Finally accept that the definition of CEO is "person who, if you can't reach agreement in a reasonable amount of time, makes the decision". It's not your job to tell the CEO what to do, it's your job to give the CEO all the relevant information and your expert opinion. And in anything other than a very small company, the CEO can't personally attend to every case of someone disagreeing with them.
