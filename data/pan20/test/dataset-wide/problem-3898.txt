For what it's worth, the motivation is that this colimit is the usual definition of the sheaf on a not-necessarily-open subset $K$ (or if you like, the global sections of the inverse image sheaf under the inclusion $K\hookrightarrow \mathbb{R}^d$), and so it would be nice if this colimit had a relatively concrete description. 

What I have in mind is the following: a (sequence of) functor(s) $K_\bullet$ on the category of topological $^*$-algebras (with values in the category of commutative groups) that satisfies (among other properties one would wish a $K$-theory functor to possess) (i) $K_\bullet (A)=K_\bullet ^{\text{op}}(A)$ when $A$ is a $C^*$-algebra and (ii) $K_\bullet (A)=K_\bullet ^{\text{alg}}(A)$ when $A$ has involution the identity and the discrete topology. As a matter of fact, a quick skim of the construction of $K_0^{\text{op}}(A)$ (as the grothendieck group of unitary equivalence classes of projections in $M_\infty (A)$) seems as if would work verbatim for an arbitrary topological $^*$-algebra, and furthermore, would give the same definition in the case of involution the identity and the discrete topology (this uses the fact that if self-adjoint elements are conjugate, then they are in fact unitarily equivalent). (I suppose one possible issue with extending this to the higher $K$-groups in the most obvious way is determining the 'right' topology to put on the tensor product of topological $^*$-algebras in order to define the suspension.) Does there exist such an extension? If not, why not? If so, is there a reference? 

(There are of course left and two-sided versions of the above definitions.) It is well-known that every field possesses an algebraic-closure, which is unique up to (nonunique) isomorphism. What about division rings? 

For $K\subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$ compact, let $C_{\mathrm{c}}^{\infty}(K)$ denote the space of smooth functions on (an open neighborhood of) $K$ with compact support contained in $K$ with the usual Fréchet space subspace topology inherited from $C^{\infty}(K)$, and denote by $C_{\mathrm{c}}^{\infty}(K)^*$ the dual with the Mackey topology (or, equivalently, the strong polar topology). For $U\subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$ open, let $C_{\mathrm{c}}^{\infty}(U)$ denote the LF-space of smooth functions with compact support contained in $U$, and denote by $C_{\mathrm{c}}^{\infty}(U)^*$ the space of generalized-functions on $U$, again, with the Mackey topology (or equivalently the strong polar topology). If $K\subseteq U$, we have extension-by-zero maps $C_{\mathrm{c}}^{\infty}(K)\rightarrow C_{\mathrm{c}}^{\infty}(U)$, and we thereby obtain restriction maps $C_{\mathrm{c}}^{\infty}(U)^*\rightarrow C_{\mathrm{c}}^{\infty}(K)^*$. 

No, this is in general quite far from being true (and also somewhat ill-posed, since there is not a natural candidate for what "=" means since there is no map). For example, take $M = S^1$ and $N=S^2$, both with the antipodal $C_2$-action (which you can view as either right or left action). Then $M/C_2 \simeq S^1$ so $H_*(M/C_2 \times N;k) \cong H_*(S^1 \times S^2;k)$ as graded groups. But $C_2$ acts as $-1$ on $H_2(N)$ and trivially on $H_*(M)$ so $H_*(M \times_{C_2} N;{\mathbb Q}) \cong H_*(M \times N;{\mathbb Q})_{C_2} \cong H_*(M;{\mathbb Q}) \cong H_*(S^1;{\mathbb Q})$ as graded abelian groups, where $C_2$ on the outside denotes coinvariants. 

Even for $n=1$ the cofiber will almost never be a loop space. There is no reason for it to be a loop space, and plenty of reasons for it not to be a loop space. E.g., it would need to be a simple space, its cohomology would need to be a Hopf algebra,.... These are usually not satisfied in examples; see the comments, eg. Chris' example $RP^2$. What Presma studies for $n=1$ is the different question of when $f: X \to Y$ is part of a fibration sequence $X \to Y \to Z$ not a cofibration sequence. (These only agree in the stable range.) Is this what you are really after? I agree that there should be a higher version of that theory. 

Note that a group like $GL_n(\mathbb F_p)$ of course would be in $\mathcal L_3$. Whether it is in $\mathcal L_1$ depends a bit on which $\mathbf G$ you are willing to start with. Now, you may want to limit the class in $\mathcal L_2$ in some way to ensure that it is not larger than $\mathcal L_3$ and avoid the "pathologies". I would be surprised if there was a good way to do this, without referring back to $\mathcal L_3$: The main problem, I think, it that there is no really good "purely group theoretic" way of e.g., specifying that you only allow extensions "on top" by diagonal automorphisms (not field or graph), without getting back into the Lie theory. This is at least what goes wrong in the $SO_{2n}^+(\mathbb F_q)$, $q$ even, case. (Derek also hinted at this.) You may also, conversely, argue that $\mathcal L_2$ is anyway too small, since it is not closed under iteratively putting things "on top" and "on the bottom"; to be "almost" of Lie type should be a bigger class... The cleanest fix for this is to go all the way and study the groups which are virtually a finite group of Lie type, i.e., has a finite index subgroup which a finite group of Lie type. Now, this class of groups is however of course just the class of virtually trivial groups, aka all finite groups... This is not as silly as it sounds, since many deep open problems in finite group theory, such as Alperin's conjecture and its cousins, stem from the philosophy that all finite groups behave almost like finite groups of Lie type.... 

In what follows, $x$ is always taken to commute with the coefficient ring. This means that for any given polynomial, you can put the coefficients to the right or the left of $x$ as you please. This doesn't make a difference to the ring itself, but it will make a difference for the roots: a right root is an element that yields zero upon evaluation when you write $x$ to the right of the coefficients. (Similarly for left root. I suppose a two-sided root would be an element that is both a right and a left root.) For example, $\mathrm{j}$ is a right root but not a left root of the following polynomial (working in the quaternions). $$ \mathrm{i}x-\mathrm{k}. $$ 

If $x:\Lambda \rightarrow X$ is a net in a topological space $X$ and $\Lambda '\subseteq \Lambda$ is a cofinal subset of the directed set $\Lambda$, then $x|_{\Lambda '}$ is a subnet of $x$. We call subnets of this form strict subnets. Of course, not all subnets are of this form, and indeed, the definition of a subnet is chosen the way it is in part so that certain theorems we would like to be true are in fact true. I am in particular curious about the following standard theorem. 

Looking at the proof, I definitely see where it would no go through if we were restricted to strict subnets, and it seems as if there would be no easy way to fix this with this restriction. Of course, this doesn't mean that it can't be proven---maybe we just haven't been clever enough to figure out how to do it with only strict subnets? I am quite confident this is not actually the case, however, and that there is indeed a counter-example. Kelley presents an example (pg. 77 of his General Topology, attributed to Arens) that is meant to demonstrate why strict subnets are not enough. He presents an example of a net with a cluster point to which no subnet converges. Unfortunately, the example he gives is Lindelöf, but not quasicompact (and personally, I could live with nets not having subnets converging to cluster points (this is already the case for limit points, for example)). So then, is there a well-known example of a quasicompact space and a net with no convergent strict subnet?
