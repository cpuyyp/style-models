You may be seeing the same thing that I'm seeing (on social media), and I've added the links below as evidence of this, more often than not, they don't define what they mean (in this case, they do - for instance, you'll see "the smart money is moving against the USD" etc). This term is very common on social media stock discussions. StockTwit example Tumblr post The way that I understand is that these are individuals who have a commercial interest in a position. For instance, if the price of oil goes through the roof and a company has a lot to gain from that, they may take a hedge out against the position, in case of a fall, especially if the price goes to an extreme and they know it can't be sustained (you'll see a massive short movement). This is true with currencies as well (ie: an export driven business must watch exchange rates). It should be of note that they aren't always the "smart" move and they generally are early to the party, as you can see with their bets against oil (very early, and notice how quickly they cut some of the shorts as prices plummeted). The key is to watch their positions; they will generally be short, but when they make a strong short position, that could spell that something will happen. I do not think that this is an economic term; more of a trading term. 

I came across this post by Krugman and I think for those interested in learning about these different theories that the below quote helps when thinking about supply shocks and Keynesian economics: 

What does Pierpaolo Battigalli really mean? If the actions for a player chooses has been specified, then it automatically specify a pure strategy. By this methodology, he seems to want to distinguish a game structure with commitment and a game without, but how? Added: Here is the slides used in the video, and here is the corresponding paper. 

I would like strongly recommend David Kreps' latest textbook, Microeconomic Foundations I: Choice and Competitive Markets . It contains true virtuosity and is very inspiring. Take utility representation theorem as an example. Kreps forsake the assumption in MWG of taking $\mathbb R^n$ as the underlying space so that readers won't be left with the false impression that this theorem is of limited interest. I also $\heartsuit$ the presentation of GE as a generalized NE which helps developing connections between different areas. 

Can we have some other implication, like, If a game admits a unique Nash equilibirum, does common knowledge of rationality implies Nash equilibirum? 

What Ann believes implies Ann is rational. What Ann believes Bob believes implies that Ann believes Bob is rational. What Ann believes Bob believes Ann believes implies Ann believes Bob believes Ann is rational. $\ldots \ \ldots$ 

I'm interested to know economic justifications of forgetting in various fields. On example is Green and Porter(1984). To sustain a Cartel, Cartel members have incentive to forget deviations in a sufficiently distant past. Another is Ekmekciy(2011) which shows that a rating system works better if it stops publicize misconducts, once they're old enough. Literature on a more abstract level is also welcomed, e.g. results like it's more socially desirable in a dynamic games, some agents are restricted to stationary strategies. 

This is over looking the fact that much of the wealth is invested in companies who hire people. As an example, if 90% of Warren Buffett's wealth was in Berkshire, and he had to liquidate to re-distribute his wealth, that would have an affect on the economy, some inflationary, some deflationary. But it would also cause some people to lose their jobs; that money invested is providing jobs - it's lending to a business, which in turn hires people, buys resources, etc. 

I agree that this question is too broad, but here's a perspective: much of the criticism of modern capitalism is from people who've been in the system. What about people who haven't been in the system, like in Vietnam or China, where they haven't been under capitalism in the past? Do they tell us what we're missing out on? One study I've seen all over: 

So when they confiscated land from the land owners in Zimbabwe, why wasn't there a HUGE boost to the economy? Again, this would be like confiscating Steve Jobs' wealth (a lot of which was in Apple) when he was alive and redistributing it, thinking that the overall effect will be good, when what you've really done is stifle innovation. A good example of wealth redistribution is Zimbabwe. As you can read, it turned out very well! Another good example is the Soviet Union - there has never been a more equal society as far as wealth (excluding bureaucrats, of course). 300% inflation and many people starved to death. If wealth is a product of skill, redistributing wealth may discourage skill; and in the long run, it won't be pretty. At least the two examples I provided show some pretty significant inflation. 

I think this is a poor oversimplication of Robert Lucas's maxim. It's one thing that Robert Lucas models markets as if "always in equilibrium", it's quite another Robert Lucas claims it's an empirical truth that "market is always in equilibrium". Lucas(1978) explained briefly why he chose such methodology which doesn't faithfully reflects reality: 

Suppose three advertisers, I, II, III are participating in an auction for three positions for online advertising, top, middle and bottom. Assume that click per second for a position is not affected by who poses an advertisement there. For top, the click through rate is 3 click per second, for middle, it's 2, for bottom, it's 1. But advertisers have private value per click. For I, it's \$16 per click. For II, it's \$15. For III, it's \$14. The one who submits the highest wins the top position and pays the second highest bid, second highest bidder got the middle position and pays the third highest bid. The third highest bidder end up with bottom position, but pays zero. If there's a tie, then choose the winner ramdomly by a fair dice. The strategy space for each bidder is $\mathbb{R}_{+}$. There're a lot of NE for this game. For example, I,II,III simultaneously submit bids of, \$7 per click, \$9 per click, \$11 per click respectively. Their payoff will be $1 \times (16-0)$ dollars, $2\times (15-7)$ dollars, and $3 \times (14-9)$ dollars respectively. $$ \begin{array}{c|l|c|r} \hline &(0,7) & (7,9) & (9,11) & (11, +\infty)\\ \hline \text{player I}& \color{blue}{16} & \color{blue}{16} & 2(16-9)=14& 3(16-11)=15 \\ \hline \text{player II}& 15 & 2(15-7)=\color{blue}{16} & 2(15-7)=\color{blue}{16}& 3(15-11)=12 \\ \hline \text{player III}& 14 & 2(14-7)=14 & 3(14-9)= \color{blue}{15} & 3(14-9)= \color{blue}{15}\\ \hline \end{array} $$ How to find other NE? Added: I want to study this numerical example, because I want to understand better the motivation of this paper. 

This is part of the reason why this question is too broad. We could say that while some systems abandon it, others will use it. I also don't know if a capitalist-like system didn't exist before Adam Smith, as from reading some Roman history, there seems to be times where there was a merchant class featuring open markets with entrepreneurs where they would meet the needs of those they traded with and while they certainly didn't call it capitalism (I assume), like we do, seems very similar. I believe Plato pointed out that civilizations often move from one system to another, like Oligarchy to Democracy, before reverting, so the very nature of a Meritocracy may be a transitional stage in a civilization's history. 

This isn't to say I agree or disagree; I find it helpful to understand that focusing on the demand side cannot help if we have a supply shock. To my knowledge, the best preparation for a supply shock, like the California Drought leading to food prices quadrupling (ONLY in theory), would be to have a supply surplus saved or ready in case of such events. 

A few pundits have been stating that we have a student loan bubble, and this bubble will pop, similar to housing. I'm struggling to imagine the economic impact of what this would look like if these pundits are right, outside the obvious bailout or student loan forgiveness. Hypothetically, let's say a scenario where 15% of students are unable to pay back their loans occurs, and the government bails them out (or forgives their loans), how would that be a negative economic event? Would it create inflation? Would it cost in terms of productivity, in that students would spend more time borrowing money and staying in school than working and producing? 

This question arises from reading of Sannikov and Scrzypacz (2007) and Green and Porter(1984), which are modeling the same thing, dynamic collusion under imperfect monitoring, in a continuous-time version and a discrete-time version. Their choice of different noises term are crucial to derivation of their conclusions. My question is how to decide which one is dominant for a particular market(e.g. European banana market) regarding the modeling of noises. My guess is that multiplicative noise term is more relevant to shocks of weather, additive accumulative noise term(following Brownian motion in Sannikov and Scrzypacz's case) is more relevant to shocks related to institution, say, cultural revolution and Khomeini's return to Iran. 

Consider a three-legged centipede game of incomplete information with Harsanyi's universal type space. Ann of type $t_a$ believes that Bob plays $``In"$, while Ann of type $u_a$ believes that Bob plays $“Out”$ . Bob, on the other hand believes Ann is type $u_a$ and plays $``Out"$. Then at the state $(t_a, (In,Out),Out)$ that is not the backward induction path, common belief of rationality still holds. What we need to verify are, at the given state: 

I'm interested to know the exact magnitude of impact of Subprime Mortgages crisis on major players in investment banking. In particular, how can I find data for percentage of revenue from Subprime Mortgages in total revenue for major banks, like Goldman Sachs, Morgen Stanley, The Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers? 

Notice that we only need to check the first three steps, what Ann believes Bob believes Ann believes is the same as what Ann believes Bob believes Ann believes $\ldots$ Bob believes Ann believes. The same procedure applies to a similar situation of interchanging Ann and Bob in the above reasoning. To make the baseline result that common belief implies backward induction, we can switch to hyperreal-valued belief system. Specifically, a player will not rule out any of her opponent's strategies. If she believes an opponent is rational, and strategy $s_1$ yields higher payoff compared with $s_2$ for this opponent, then she will believe that $s_1$ is infinitely more likely than $s_2$. Now, if it's the case that Ann believes Bob is rational, then Bob should believe that then the chance Ann plays $“Out"$ at the third node conditional on that she plays $“In"$ at the first node is smaller than $\frac{2}{3}$. But if Ann believes Ann believes Bob believes Ann of type $t_a$ and $u_a$ is rational, then the standard part of the probability that Ann plays $“Out"$ at the third node conditional on that she plays $“In"$ at the first node equals $1$. Of course, exactly the same argument works for lexicographic probability which is more parsimonious. My guess is that one of drawback to prevent hyperreal probability form wide application may be that we can't define infinite product of infinitesimal number. For example, in an infinite extensive game, a player believe that the probability that the probability of reaching each node of a path equals $\epsilon$ which is the equivalence class of $(1, \frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{3},\frac{1}{4},\frac{1}{5}, \ldots,)$ up to a fixed ultrafilter on $\mathbb{N}$. Of course, we expect that the chance that this path is realized should also be infinitesimal. But notice that $\epsilon = \epsilon_n := \{a_i^n\}_{i \in \mathbb{Z_+}}$ in which \begin{eqnarray}a_i^n= \begin{cases} 1, &i<n \cr mn^{n-1}, &i=n \cr \frac{1}{i}, &i>n\end{cases} \end{eqnarray} Contrasted with finite product, if we define the inifinite product of hyperreal numbers as their componentwise product, then, in this case, we can make it equal any real number $m$.
