It's somewhat curious that both the Roman calendar and the Roman numerals used subtraction quite extensively; for neither is there any modern equivalent. For example, even the Advent sundays (which are defined as the four sundays before Christmas) are counted upwards; surely one could call them the fourth, third, second, first sunday (before Christmas) in that order instead, but that is not being done. By contrast, the Roman calendar used subtractive counting throughout, being entirely based on months and 'signal post' days within each month (kalends, nones, ides) that are being counted 'towards'. Likewise, in numerals, I, II, III, IV, V stand for the numbers one to five, with IV replacing the more straightforward IIII (which form is still used on clock faces, though). This is repeated with higher numbers, viz IX = 9, XC = 90, CM = 900 and so on. Be it said that usage appears to have been far from uniform, though; also, the Wikipedia article has many contradictory examples, and most are not from early (classical and pre-classical) times, so it's not immediately clear what the earliest forms were. In both cases, the downward counting is so counter-intuitive to a modern observer that one is compelled to think there should have been a strong motivation for it to occur; maybe that motivation was in the number words of the early language; and, indeed @Yellow Sky cites duodētrīgintā ('2 from 30', 28 = 30 – 2) and ūndētrīgintā ('1 from 30', 29 = 30 - 1), which are quite naturally written out as IIXXX and IXXX in Roman numerals. One could venture a wild hypothesis that in ancient Latium, there was a people with a language that used (partially) subtractive counting, vestiges of which system are to be found in their calendar and written number systems, akin to the 'twelve' vs 'thirteen', 'dozen' and 'gross', 'quatre-vingt-dix' of modern times that betray earlier duodecimal and vigesimal systems. The German Wikipedia article on Roman numerals somewhat rejects the link between written and spoken forms: "Die subtraktive Schreibung [...] stimmt aber mit [den Schreibweisen] nicht überein. Bei den lateinischen Zahlwörtern werden die Wörter für 1 und 2, aber nicht auch die für 10 und 100 subtraktiv verwendet und hierbei dann in der Regel auch nur den Vielfachen der 10 ab 20 (duodeviginti = 18, undeviginti = 19)"; OTOH, it admits that 'undecentum' = 99 (= IC) does sometimes appear in ancient sources. $URL$ $URL$

As far as modern Standard German (Hochdeutsch) is concerned, (1) 'ä' is merely an orthographic device whose sound value is the same as 'e' in the same position; (2) there is some vacillation among speakers when it comes to the long vowel; the short variant is always [ɛ] unless someone wants to sound comical. Standard pronunciation suggests to read long 'ä' as [ɛ:] as contrasted with long 'e' [e:], but this is not generally followed except for a few isolated cases like the interjection 'äh' [ʔɛ:] (people often perform sounds in interjections that they'd otherwise claim not to say at all, like the click in E. 'tsk'). The reason standard pronunciation wants us to read 'ä' as [ɛ:] at all comes from the misunderstanding that where there's a separate way to write words, there should also be a separate way to read those words. Needless to say, this idea fails in many places, not least of which is the contrast of short 'ä' and 'e', which are undisputedly always [ɛ]. There's also some utility to keeping [e:] ~ [ɛ:] separate as there are a few minimal pairs that would otherwise sound the same, such as Beeren ~ Bären (berries, bears) and Ehre ~ Ähre (honor, ear of corn). So why do people not follow and keep [e:] ~ [ɛ:] separate? One, because it is artificially introduced, phonetically not very salient and, usage-wise, not very useful distinction to be made, as only a handful of lexical items profit from the distinction. Also, there's a constant interference from the many dialects that have only the one or the other vowel, or, when they have both, use them in ways that conflict with what the standard would have us do. As in other languages, most people do not natively speak the perfect standard natively; rather, it is an acquired dialect that is approximated from the sound-base of what one grew up talking. One reason why one should definitely not follow the folly and separate [e:] ~ [ɛ:] is because it's at odds with the overall German vowel system. German has 7 simple full vowels, viz. /a,e,i,o,u,ø,y/ (plus schwa), all of which come in a short and a long variant. The short ones are generally laxer / more open than the tenser / more closed long ones, so [a, ɛ, ɪ, ɔ, ʊ, œ, ʏ] contrast with [a:, e:, i:, o:, u:, ø:, y:]. An extra [ɛ:] does not fit well into this symmetry. (There's yet another variant for each vowel that is used mainly in words of Latin or Greek origin; these are described as being a mixture of the short and the long ones in that the vowel quality is rather tense, but the quantity is short or half-long, which gives [aˑ, eˑ, iˑ, oˑ, uˑ, øˑ, yˑ]). As for why an extra letter Ää was introduced into the spelling when it doesn't correspond to a sound of its own, well, that's a good question. On the one hand, using 'ä' to mark the Umlaut does tie related words together, so you can immediately see that 'Korn', 'Körner', 'Fluss', 'Flüsse' and 'Lachen', 'Lächeln' are related. OTOH we write a lot of words with 'ö' and 'ü' that do not have a modern counterpart with 'ä', 'o', 'u', ex. 'Öl' (*Ol), 'Süden' (*Suden), 'Ähre' (*Ahre). Worse, there are lots of historical Umlaut vowels that are not marked in the orthography at all, ex. 'Gewitter' (<Wetter), 'Gebirge' (<Berg), and then there's a fair number of high-frequency words where usage has been non-uniform over the past one or two hundred years, ex. 'ächt'-'echt', 'Ältern'-'Eltern', 'Stängel'-'Stengel', 'enbläuen'-'einbleuen'. 

Recently I have noticed that some languages have a sound which is somewhere between the "traditional" d and t. An example of this is the name "Roberto", pronounced by a Spanish or Italian speaking person. It doesn't sound like the t in "tower", nor does it sound like the d in "donkey". It is somewhere between the two, so: Does this sound have a name? What is it's name? Which languages have it? 

The weekdays in my native language (Bavarian) are very inconsistent and two of them apparently came to us from the Goths, who in turn have adopted them from Greek. The two days in question are "Iada" (Day of Ares; Tuesday) and "Bfinsda" (Fifth Day; Thursday). What bothers me especially about that is why one comes from the old Greek system (using god names) and one from the new system (using numbers). Quite a while ago I read that the Greeks (among others) adopted the number system because they did not want their weekday names to originate from heathen gods. Sadly I cannot find the source anymore. So my basic question is: Why did we adopt these two different styles? I am aware that this question may not have a factual answer, so here some alternative questions that could shed some light on it: 

I am not aware of any studies on this topic, probably because it is highly based on the circumstances. Usually when a child is brought up with multiple languages, then it has no foreign accent in any of them. The older that child gets before it studies a new language, the more likely it is to have an accent. I cannot back this up with my own experience, but I know a lot of people who can (e.g. look @A.Toumentsev's comment). Another reason why it's hard to give a direct answer is because some languages sound more similar to others and are thus easier to learn without having an accent. My fiancee is Colombian, but the first time she spoke Bavarian sounded almost perfect. This is true for most Spanish and Italian speakers. On the other side, even though Bavarian is a Germanic language, if a German speaks Bavarian it just sounds horrible and you can hear a very thick accent. It takes a long time of practice before it sounds good. Determination is also a reason. Some people only care about learning a language so they are understood, while others want to sound like a native. That means that some people are never accent free and others sound almost like natives only after a few months. I know plenty of people who learn a language just to be understood, without trying to adopt a native accent (though I don't find that objectionable). I for one tried to get an American accent when I started to learn English and I came pretty close (it probably used to be better than it is now), up to a point where Spaniards told me that I have an English accent in Spanish. Lastly, it all depends on the amount you speak and listen to natives. If you only ever talk a language with others who are foreign to the language or if you are only ever writing that language, then the time required to loose your accent will increase even more. Personally I think one should make an effort to learn somebody else's language well, but keep a slight accent, it makes you likable ;) 

So I was researching IPA a bit and tried to map the sounds of my native language to it. What I encountered was that our typical "i" is between the "i" and "y" on this chart on Wikipedia: $URL$ or the official one: $URL$ Why is there no symbol for that sound in IPA? 

Quite recently I have noticed that most Bavarian verbs can become theoretical epistemic modal. What I mean by that is that you can take any verb, e.g. "[i] ko" - "[I] can", and turn it into it's theoretical form "[i] kand" - "[I] could". The special thing about Bavarian though is that you can make it even more theoretical and turn it into "[i] kandad" which could be translated to "[I] could (in theory)". Another example is "[i] muas" - "[I] must/need to" turning to "[i] miassd" - "[I] would need to" and finally "[i] miassad" - "[I] would need to (in theory)". Are there other languages that have this "two tier system"? I'm especially interested in other Germanic languages. I am sorry if I misused any technical term. I just got into studying them, so if they are misused, please tell so I can fix it. 

Obviously language changes, which is the reason why numbers have many different names in languages. Comparing the German "einundzwanzig" (one-and-twenty) with the English "twenty one" shows what I mean. My question is about changes that happened naturally and without influence of another language. I got curious in this because, if math is offered in a public school, then a child gets to know the numbers by the name of their language. It gets ingrained into them and thus it doesn't make sense for an adult to suddenly change the word for a number and even less sense for a school to do the same. Are there any language which has undergone such a change since the introduction of public schools? If there are indeed such languages, how could they undergo such a change?
