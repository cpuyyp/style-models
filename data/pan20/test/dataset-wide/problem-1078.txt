Apparentely, after some testing...there is a way to speed up SQLPS load time (tremendously) and prevent the WMI warnings (if you don't need the module loaded. How I tested this on my laptop, was simply by shutting down the WMI service: . I then proceeded to edit the module files for for my SQL Server 2012 local instance. As soon as I load the module initially, I get the same warning messages you show in your question. The one that causes the specific problem is the file. This file is a nested module based on the module manifest, so everytime you load this script is going to be executed. This file is also why when the module is loaded it changes your location in your prompt. The first line of the file is . [If you comment out that line it can also speed up the load time for the module a good bit.] The lines that are causing the WMI warnings are from the two lines of code that will load the module. Which if you look at the documentation for PowerShell in BOL it states it is loaded with here. It also goes to mention when configuring remote administration for that in step 3 WMI Service has to be running. Which if you don't have access to WMI equates to the service not appear as running. So in the end, as long as you don't need Analysis Services PowerShell module you can edit the file, found under: 

In SQL Server 2012 the event XML output of Extended Events changed dramatically; enough where it broke any code used for SQL Server 2008. A write of this can be found by Jonathan Kehayias: Extended Events Changes in SQL Server 2012 â€“ Event XML for XML data elements You will need to change the CTE for to the following: 

You would need to check the security setting of the package configuration (inside the package). The default for a package is "EncryptSenstiveWithUserKey", which means only that user can modify the package or read the connection manager objects. You also don't provide how the packages are deployed. If they are deployed to the Package Store or SQL Server then the security setting mentioned above does not apply. If they are using file level deployment who executes the job or owns it can play a role in the issue you are having....meaning you will have to adjust the packages. 

I will go ahead and let you know something that I found out the hard way. Using SMO you can connect to SQL Server 2000 up to SQL Server 2014, however, each version of SQL Server can vary on where particular properties are located. I had a learning conversation with Jonathan Kehayias on Twitter one afternoon learning this but I cannot recall what property I was looking for. In these situations the .NET class library on MSDN for SMO is your friend because it can help guide you to properties you are looking for. 

This is just my input, but I have supported most of the major players in the 3rd party backup vendors. I have supported clients that utilize Idera, RedGate, Dell LiteSpeed, NetBackup (which does not really have compression but is 3rd party), and a few off-the-wall vendors that I can't remember anymore. The improved compression you may or may not get with 3rd party products have a trade-off....CPU workload. I have seen Dell's (LiteSpeed) product run in SQL Server 2014 environment against a database that is right at 500GB, and using high compression kills the CPU. The result was only a backup file of around 64GB. It ended up causing SQL Server to stop providing resources to the backups since Dell's product uses the VDI API. The compression level had to be dropped down from 7 to about 3, this brought the backup size down to about 82GB. We took a native backup with compression enabled of same database, and it was right at 84GB in size. So is the trade off and cost worth it? I seem to recall a client I had a few years ago was using Idera's product and I had constant issues with the backups for their medical databases that were 1TB+ in size. I think some of it had to do with the disk subsystem the backups were being written to, which again is why you need to test. Overall Idera's GUI interface is not inviting to me, and could use great improvement. I would chose RedGate or Dell over Idera any day of the week. You also have to remember that most 3rd party backup products are going to use the VDI API to SQL Server. This in and of itself can cause problems as well, frequent to often "BackupVirtualDevice" or "BackupIORequest" errors showing up in the error log. I have some of these be false positives (backup actually did occur) and some where legit failures. Make sure to read through the vendor support article or forums. RedGate and Idera have very good support systems in place and are very good about getting back with help. Dell I have not had to make any support calls with their product so far. The one last thing I will bring up is the format of the backup taken by the 3rd party product. If you get into a DR situation are you going to have a standby server licensed with the product as well? I believe Dell allows you to install LiteSpeed without a license to do a restore, but it has to be licensed to do any backups. I think most of the vendors also include a utility to convert a vendor specific database to a SQL Server native backup file, in case of emergency. 

Permissions to assign her are going to be based on what deployment model she is going to use within your environment. SSIS 2012/2014 added an additional model: Project and Package For Package Deployment model she has the option of deploying the packages to . Granting her permissions for this type of deployment you will grant her permissions to an SSIS role. If she is the only person that is going to be working with the packages you can simply grant her . This will provide her permissions to do anything she needs with the packages she creates and deploys (making her the owner of those packages). You can read through the article linked to get an idea of more. For Project Deployment model you will need to work with the catalog. With this it is just granting permissions at a database-level role. If this is not already created on the instance you will need to do this for her. Once it is created you should see a database that will have a specific role called , this role is special to the catalog database and is not a normal role found in every database. The database will show up under the Databases node in Object Explorer, just go to and find the role. Within the properties of that role you can add her login.
