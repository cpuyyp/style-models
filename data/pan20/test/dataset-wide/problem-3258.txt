and others. Another idea, that these features were inherited from Proto-Indo-Europeans does not explain why other IE peoples did not exhibit similar culture. It seems that proto-Classic civilization originated in the Balkans and encompassed several diverse peoples of IE origin (Proto-Greeks, Thracians (including Dacians), Illirians, Macedonians, Liburgians, Messapians, Paeonians, Bryges (later known as Phrygians), possibly also proto-Italians). So my question is 

As you know, Germany justified their pursuit for Liebensraum (living space in Eastern Europe) by comparing themselves with established colonial powers, that is Britain and France and claiming that Germany deserves similar rights. The practice of comparing Germany with the US, Britain and France was very widely used. At the time, racial segregation was common in the US and in British colonies, so Germans thought such segregation would be justified for Germany as well. 

Bank offices were usually opened 6 days a week, but at Saturdays they closed earlier. Interesting to note here is that the savings on bank accounts were protected against court action: the court could not confiscate the money from your bank account to pay for your debts. In case you are sued for debt, the court would rule to repay it from a share of your salary, not from your bank account. Savings book (account book) from 1950s, the design kept essentially unchanged till the collapse of the USSR, but the current design is still very similar. In the 1970s the records were started to be printed rather than written by hand. 

Most of Japanese history the emperor was a figurehead so there was no struggle to become an emperor, the real power belonged to a shogun for which position there was a lot of struggle indeed. 

In short. Croats - mostly pro-Axis Muslims - mostly pro-Axis Serbs - mostly pro-Allies except Chetniks Chetniks are very much like Russian Cossacks. Far-right, nationalist, anti-Communist, unreliable, prone to switching sides and pro-themselves. 

This is because scientific discovery is not just observing and finding something. Scientific discovery also includes 

It is theorized that ancient Proto-Indo-Europeans (4000-3000 BC) considered fame and glory as a form of (at least symbolic) immortality. Thus earning war glory was very important for their warriors. The memory of their deeds was transmitted in oral form by poets. In connection with this, one should mention the reconstructed expression in PIE language cleu̯os ndhğhitom (retained in Greek as kleos aphiton, Old Indic sravas aksitam) dated to PIE time, which means "imperishable fame" (literally, "non-burnable"). 

I wonder to what extent this practice was widespread and when it appeared? I also wonder how the spread of Christianity affected this. 

In 1993 in Russia the President Boris Yeltsin disagreed with the Supreme Council over appointment of prime minister. He wanted to appoint the extremely unpopular Yegor Gaidar which the Council did not want to approve. He then ordered the dissolution of the parliament to do which he had no right. The supreme court decided that he violated the Constitution and as such, according the constitution he should be automatically suspended as President with all power going to the vice-President Rutskoy who sided with the parliament. But Yeltsin was strongly supported by the USA, by the military and by the media. He ordered tanks to fire at the building of Supreme Council due to which about 500 people died. He then adopted a law that guaranteed him that he will not be held responsible for any crimes he committed in office even after retirement. 

The Great Purge in the USSR already in the 1930s became known as Yezhovshchina. The main drive behind the purge in the military, and followed Great Terror of 1937 was newly-appointed (September, 1936) Commissar of the Internal Affairs Nikolay Yezhov. It is quite conceivable that he initially convinced Stalin that there were some serious conspiracies in the military. But less than a year after the start of the purge it seems the Politburo of Central Committee started changing the attitude. On July 31, 1937 there was issued a directive by the Central Committee to appoint all the purged officers who were fired even on political charges on economic positions. ...And dispite this the NKVD (Commissariat of Internal Affairs, Yezhov) continued to issue repressive orders (August, 11). On October 17, 1937 there is a directive by Commissariat of Defense, forbidding firing officers and demanding on any suspensions on political charges to consult with the Commissariat of Defense. In January, 1938 was conducted a Plenum of Central Committe which issued a directive "About the mistakes of the party organizations regarding expulsions of Communists from the party and about the formal and bureaucratic attitude towards appeals of those excluded from the party and fixing those flaws" January 20, 1938. A directive by Schadenko, ordering to re-consider all fire orders for the whole 1937 and restore all wrongly fired from the Red Army. November 17, 1938. A joint directive by Stalin and Molotov "About arrests, prosecutor's oversight and conducting the investigations" which effectively put an end to the purge and contained a lot of criticism of those repressions and methods involved, hinting that there were enemies in the NKVD body itself. Yezhov was appointed the Commissar of the Water Transport in April, received a deputy Beria in August (who effectively took all affairs) and was fired from his Commissar of Internal Affairs position in November. The majority of those executed during Stalin's rule (about 800 thousand) fall on 1937. So, it was Stalin, not Khrushchev who started to uncover and criticize the extensive repressions in the USSR. Khrushchev did not invent anything except blaming also Stalin. We can see that starting from July, 1937 the Central Committee (Stalin's body) started to resist the purges conducted by NKVD. 

In the 19th-20th centuries an industrial worker in a city (not to say a person of intellectual labor) could earn much greater money than an agricultural worker. This was a major driver behind rapid urbanization. It should be noted also that technological innovations spread to the rural areas much slower than inside cities, thus making the farmers to look somehow "backwards". Also the agricultural work did not require any education except the traditional training. That even more worsened the image of a farmer who often was even illiterate. 

======= It should be noted however that it is quite uncertain to which extent the Chechen population supported separatism. On all elections they voted for a candidate that was supported by the Kremlin. The originator of the secession of Chechnya, president Dudayev was initially supported by anti-Communists who seized power in Moscow in the early 1990s. He was a honored Soviet pilot who participated in the Afghan war and was the only Chechen to become a Soviet general. He then quickly proceeded to install personal dictatorship. After Dudayev was killed, a new president Maskhadov was elected. He was known for signing a peace treaty with Moscow and was supported by the Russian media in hope he would be a moderate leader. This suggests that the Chechens in general did not want a war. It turned out later that Maskhadov either supported the Jihadists and terrorists or was unable to do anything to control the situation, so the accords he signed were broken. 

Thus it is unevident how Roman republic was not a "constitutional monarchy" with a ceremonial king alike medieval Japan. 

Wikipedia says that Ronald Reagan persuaded Saudi Arabia to rise oil production so to drop the prices and make pressure on the Soviet economy. I encountered such claim in many other sources as well. But if we look at the oil production plot 

There is a theory that Crimean Karaites descended from Khazars. It was the official version in the USSR. The objections are those that their religion differ even though still a variant of Judaism and that their language belongs to a different branch of Turkic languages (actually it is the same language as that of Crimean Tatars, which may be explained by the fact that Crimean Tatar was the Lingua franca in Crimea). The most serious objection is that they have no legends about their origin of Khasars. Historically they perceived themselves to descend from Turkish Jews. 

In conclusion we can say that he was a practicing Catholic who did believe in God but did not believe in every Christian dogma that contradicted the current science. 

Again, Bolshevik slogan from 1917 "Land to the peasants", even written in old orthography, is used to justify introduction of private property on land. As to the question, whether party officials were rich, I would refer you to this answer: $URL$ 

The USSR was created in 1922 so the first one for sure cannot be from 1918. The cited first article of the constitution belongs to the constitution of 1936. The image clearly attributes it to the constitution (by small font below the phrase it says "from the constitution of the Soviet Union" and the entire phrase is in the quotes. So my guess is that the first one is from 1936-1937 (because later citing the first article of the constitution would look too trivial, but the same year the constitution was adopted it's ok). Regarding the second one, it is clearly from post-WWII era. Note the ribbon bar on the chest of the man which suggests he is a war veteran. Also note that the girl has a badge of the Komsomol similar to this: This design was adopted in 1944, so the second picture is definitely from a post-WW2 period, but not later than 1952 due to the name of the party VKP(b). I guess it is from 1950-1952. 

Russky bridge is a bridge to a sparsely populated Russky island in the Far East whose construction started in 2008 and completed in 2012. It is the world's largest cable-stayed bridge, the 1104 m long central span of which is also record-breaking. The bridge has the highest bridge pylons in the world with a height of 321 m. The bridge has six lanes with a capacity of 50 000 cars per day. But the total island's population is only 5 000 people most of whom do not have cars. The island has no road network so the bridge terminates with a dead end. The people who live on the island still have to use a ferry to reach the mainland even after the bridge construction completed. The cost of the bridge construction at over 1 billion dollars is equal to the annual budget of the whole Primorkiy Krai. So what was the actual purpose of the construction of the bridge?
