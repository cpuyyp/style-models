I personally find the word "refugee" a bit of a stretch here. Jesus' family was fleeing a danger that was very specific to them, not a general danger such as war. Jesus did flee (or rather, his parents did while he was an infant) his homeland according to the Bible story, but I don't think the word refugee is a reasonable description. Webster defines refugee as: 

Sharpton is referring to the time shortly after Jesus' birth as detailed in the Bible. He and his family did flee to Egypt. 

You may notice a caveat. This ResearchGate study is almost exclusively about skin reactions, whereas the suspect claim regards possible allergens in vaccines. It's important to note that once sensitization occurs in one tissue, other tissues also react similarly, so it does seem theoretically possible for an allergen in a vaccine to cause sensitization and elicitation. For example: 

Pyramid scheme and ponzi scheme are very specific terms that do not even come close to describing bitcoin. The simple definitions of each of these things demonstrates this abundantly clearly. Is bitcoin a sound investment? That's investment advice and not in the purview of this site to answer. Is APPL stock a sound investment? That's investment advice and not in the purview of this site to answer. Is gold a sound investment? That's investment advice and not ... you get the idea. 

In reading some recent history, I came across an open letter from Osama bin Laden to the American public. In it, he claims the typical "Jews own your banks and media" stuff. But he also claims that Benjamin Franklin warned us about that possible future. 

So what evidence is there to actually suggest that the top ten flashlight apps are collecting users' data and sending it off to China, India, and Russia for criminal purposes? 

Sean Spicer gave a press conference recently in which he gave the distinct impression that sanctuary cities have more crime than other cities because of their sanctuary status. President Trump said it outright recently: 

I would bet many people believe it. In a Yahoo article, the author insists there's little evidence for the claim, but I noticed the data quoted is about illegal immigrants committing crime, not about crime in sanctuary cities. So is there a correlation? Or is there a causation? Is there any link at all between crime rates and sanctuary city status? 

Some also criticize that there are so few data points, which is an indication of lazy experimentation. For example: 

Unless Australian registered pedophiles are often caught in Asia, I don't see how the claim can be made with much confidence. The claim seems to say this like it's common knowledge, but common beliefs have been wrong before. 

In the video Miliefsky refers to the Flashlight Apps Threat Assessment Report (PDF). The report appears to simply list the permissions that each app requests when you first install it. Whether that is a real threat or not does not seem to actually be discussed. Snopes seems to have the same sentiment as others in the security industry. 

In a simple explanation, a model of the technology was suspended on a pendulum in a vacuum and was able to produce thrust. In comparison of how much thrust, the Hall-effect thruster produces about 50 times more, but the EM drive seems to produce thrust nonetheless and future models may be able to produce something more comparable. Source It is shocking and certainly does seem to be a violation of physics as we currently understand it, however, there are a few theoretical explanations. For example: 

I'm not sure such a bold claim can be backed up with anything, except maybe circumstantial evidence like the following: 

There's an opinion piece on Fox News getting a lot of attention. I don't know the author, but in the article he claims that people kill for only three reasons. 

You can't have elicitation without first having sensitization. And it goes to follow that you can have sensitization without elicitation occurring. It further follows that some amount of allergen can cause sensitization, but not elicitation. Determining an average elicitation vs sensitization threshold is difficult because already sensitized persons can be pushed into elicitation from a smaller amount of allergen than it would take for a non-sensitized person to be pushed into sensitization in the first place. 

It's hard to say whether something like a cervical neck support brace would actually protect you it a high velocity collision. Such a device is normally meant to support your neck from existing injury worsening, based primarily on preventing overuse, over-extension, or over-flexion. They are meant to hold up the weight of your head and that's about it, not the weight of your head at 100 miles per hour. This seems a common knowledge issue to me but the Wikipedia article on cervical collars is well-sourced for their purpose. However, in stock car racing they have requirements for a HANS device (head and neck support). In NASCAR it includes a specially engineered harness that wraps around the head and down the shoulders. The driver wears a helmet and is tethered by the head to the harness. The item appears far more restrictive and protective than a simple neck brace. Yes, the stock cars are racing much much faster than a typical collision would occur at, but that doesn't change the fact that neck braces are not designed to withstand or protect against high velocity rapid deceleration. And devices that are designed to protect against rapid deceleration, like the HANS device, are far more restrictive. In researching the beneficial effects of wearing a neck brace for motorcycle riders Dirt Rider magazine put out a very well referenced article in 2013. Though not quite the same thing they conclude: 

I've heard in many places that you can catch the flu from the flu shot. This is in contrast to most other vaccines for some technical reason. I read on Gizmodo today that: 

Personally, I'm a little annoyed that the chart doesn't show units (like incidents per thousand persons) and also fails to show a source. To make things worse, it does not define some of the more ambiguous "crimes" such as "violent crime" and "property crime." I have heard elsewhere that many crimes were at all-time highs in the early and mid 1990's, but I am more concerned with these exact numbers. How close are they to reality? I understand that the answer will have to take some liberties on what the numbers actually mean (units) and might just have to do some (gulp) math. Sorry about that. I didn't make the claim; I'm just skeptical about it. I think the easiest way to verify these numbers with reality would be ratios. For example, "Violent crime" is down 51% (386.6/757.7), according to the chart. Does this match with a respectable source?
