In short, 'world' is relative to one's six sense experience. And six sense(Salayathana) bases are made out of past karma(cause) and the experience based on those senses are vipaka(effect). So the 31 planes of existence is nothing but 31 levels of sense base experiences. This is can be further explained if we analyze the availability of senses in Kama Loka, Rupa Loka and Arupa Loka: 

Based on the third point, I would give the benefit of the doubt and avoid eating that meat. This is prevalent in bhikku vinaya too, if you are in reasonable doubt; refrain. 

Also, this is evident as attaining to Rupa Jhana will result a birth in Rupa Bhrama world and attaining Arupa Jhana will result a birth in Arupa worlds. So 31 planes of existence is 31 levels of deceived karmic experience. For example, If a being is deceived to the 6 sense bases; that's called Kama loka. 

Good question. Buddhism does not talk about existance or non-existance of self(objectively). When the appropriate causes arise, belief of existence(self/world) arises. When the causes secede, everything secede. But the worldly/samsaric beings do not see this truth. Whatever existence or thing that arises which is dependent on conditions is subject to cessation. This is the most fundamental law that the Buddha realized ("Yan kinchi samudaya Dhammam sabbantham niridha Dhammam"). This is known as Pratītyasamutpāda- the core of Buddhism. Start exploring from this perspective, and you will find the complete answer to your question; oneday. 

Why? Because all this ends, this Cosmoses are fabricated. And so it goes on in the Sensual world and fine material world: 

How ever, once you have organiced your "Rahulas" production, you have certain duty out of you "linga"-worshiping (bhava-tanha) or craving after sensuality (kama-tanha) to care for it and get rightously ride of it (tanha). That starts with not harming it right from the moment of conception. "This has come into beeing." So seeing such, the burdens and sacrifies other need to bear, one does no more desire for birth and a womb but tries to pay ones last dept of gratitude, giving all back and maybe even share the highest gift, once then made his own. If you would not have been father, mother, son, daughter once, if not having Upanissaya to the Dhammas father, how could this seed possible cause a conception of light, here and now? Its good to celerbrate the fathersday, and getting the lessons of gratitude understood rightly by performing. Nobody called you to come. (Note: This is a seed of Dhamma and not meant for commercial puposes or other wordily gains.) 

Gokul NC ➨Do the gods help us if we pray to them according to Buddhism? Sure, if one honores and respects them, one can espect rewards. Like if one interacts with other beings, here being with guṇā, having performed and developed goid qualities. Like with other beings the help is of course limited to merely "outwardly". But they are also used to lift ones mind and come to skilful concentration. The Buddha praised and encouraged to sacrifies and respect in regard of the Devas and Gods and told that a person doing so where ever he goes, will always gain the respect of the Devas and be best possible protected. (Maybe my person can add a key sutta here, which came to mind) It's usuall to give wishes like "may the Devas protect you". The Buddha was always good protected and supported by the Devas and enjoyed their help and company even in his quest. Not believing in "spontaneously born beings", Deva, Gods and rejecting their existence is a factor of wrong view and one not respecting the goodness and merits of Devas and in many cases their inferior might also still have problems not knowing what is higher and foremost, which is also an indicator of the first path factor missing, yet it is even a wordily matter of right estimate. Of course Devas, aside of maybe teach or tell one Dhamma, can not help one in the task to master the path for liberation from suffering, like nobody can: Something one needs to do by oneself, and of course Devas can also not chance effects caused by ones iwn deeds and erease them to arise. But all that ciunts for other people, even the Lord Buddha likewise. It is maybe good to remark that Devas do not like the company of humans that much because of their virtue, so to enjoy best help and have Devas arround, one needs to have virtue and attributes similar to them. So torward all here coming accross: 

Following are the 3 unrighteous bodily conducts out of 10 unwholesome actions described in suttas such as Saleyyaka Sutta. 

Contrary to the popular belief, Buddhist way of life does not start with the eradication of attachment.Detached nature is a quality of final realization but definitely not the main part of the process. The noble eight fold path starts with right-view(Samma Ditti). If the path is correctly followed, the final destination will be free of suffering which is caused by attachment. Worldly beings are attached to the sensual world due to a false view(ignorance). Therefore, it is important to clear the vision first rather than removing attachment. Because it would be something forceful and artificial which leads to more problems. This is clearly evident in Buddha's main lay disciples such as Anatapindika, Vishakha or King Bimbisara who were successful in worldly life as well as supra-mundane life. All in all, aspiring financial success is not against the path as long as you are doing it in a right way(Samma Ajiva) and your main goal in life is the cessation of suffering. 

With or without intention, volitional actions are defined as kamma. For example, killing an animal in excruciating pain while the intention was to free it from agony. Even in habitual or involuntary actions, there might be an element of intention. It is just the lack of awareness or mindfulness. For example; one could slap a mosquito involuntarily; but the thought process required to kill is complete, hence bad kamma is accumulated. 

One is incapable to "fall out" or "follow other Paths", since - like in the 1. question answered - the fetter "doubt" is abounded. Now it might be possible that he/she trains within another religion als long and in so far, the views and practices contain the factors of the noble eightfold path. It's so possible, that if one maintains a "mystic" approach in regard of "God", it could be that one practices as Christian, or better under Christians, till one meets the good Dhamma, for example, or in certain other sects, but will maybe oppose certain things there naturally. So it is guaranteed by or through his/her previous deeds, the fullfilement of bringing together all pathfactors and the hearing of the good Dhamma with proper attention in advanced. 

One of the ten benefits (in the case of this abhiñña, a sideeffect of the training in the higher knowledge), which are good to increase faith when performed. In an dispute with a Brahman, whether the teaching of Lord Buddha is a selfish one or not, and by being asked if he thinks that certain powers are "real" the Brahman answered, given in the Sangarava Sutta: To Sangarava 

No, there are certain kinds mentioned and about the "leding", he she would definitly. On how: see answer question 3. A steam-winner will be born 

In the Brahmana Sutta: To Two Brahmans, he elaborates on the deeper meaning of first, the Cosmos, what it actually is, and secound gives the "End of Cosmos" another and graspworthy meaning: 

I think your idea is not practical. A justice system is a convention developed based on social norms and logic. But karma is a metaphysical phenomenon which goes beyond logic. Therefore, we will have to let karma take its course and respect the conventional legal system. 

Atheism falls under ucchedavāda which was vehemently rejected by the Buddha. It is one of two extremes that Buddha avoided by revealing the middle way; Pratītyasamutpāda. 

So in a nutshell; aggravate means the delusion of existence(of Rupa, Vedana, Sanna, Sankhara and Vinnana) in time and space. In Seela Sutta (SN 22.122) Ven. Maha Kotthita asks from Ven. Sariputta 

Anxiety is caused mainly by Uddhacca-kukkucca. And it can be abandoned by developing tranquility, concentration and equanimity of the mind. 

I would like to know if there exist a PDF version of Tripitaka which is compatible with an eBook reader(Kindle, Kobo alike)? 

According to Buddhism, everything(except nibbana) is subject to causality(Sankatha) and everything arises dependently (Paticcasamuppanna) and there is no exception to space and time! In the Pali Canon, the term Aggregate(Skandha) is defined as follows; 

So you can not "end attachment" as the first step. That should be the second step. First you should see or know(pariññeyya) the dukkha ariyasacca as it is. When you do so, attachment to dukkha can be abandoned. 

The Buddha clearly rebuked the idea of consciousness/mind that runs and wanders on [from birth to birth] in Mahatanhasankhaya Sutta (MN 38). 

How and why would a "modern" or "western" follower of the Buddhas teaching celebrate this day, and use it to pay gratitude to his father as one of his/here first God and the other three Gods? Maybe you like to share also how you fullfill this duty personaly to give others inspirations and ideas, meaning: Be not greedy in sharing possible merits you do or have done. (Note: This question is given as a gift of Dhamma and not meant for commercial purpose or other wordily gains) 

Cary Jin, let Atma give an explaining, and may it be of good use for Cary Jin and all those able to take and rejoice with it. - Namo tassa bhagavato arahato sammā-sambuddhassa - In the case "Bodhicitta" is understood as aspiration to reach "Bodhi", Awakening, the end of suffering, e.g. the wandering on in samsara, such is a Noble aspiration in the context of the path and a very needed desire to reach Nibbana, called usually positively "chanda" and not "raga" or "lobha". Without this kind of "Bodhicitta" it's not possible to complete the path and go beyound suffering. Such a "Bodhicitta" arises undestructable for the rest of the path with reaching the Stream, hence a person of such "Bodhicitta" can be understood as Noble One. In the case understanding "Bodhicitta" as a motivation behind the aspiration, to reach the end of suffering, e.g. a higher wordily reason or wordily purpose, to reach "Bodhi", such is a defiled aspiration and the "Bodhicitta" of a wordling, merely seeking for becoming, not having heared and being familar of the good Dhamma. While it can be a helpful aspiration to set out in search for a path, here mostly still with a wordily aim, it is in most cases the greatest obstacel, even if standing right in front of the door to stream-enter. Liking to become a Buddha is based on wrong view. A very useful essay to get ride of the defilement of self-view, sakkāyadiṭṭhi, of this kind is Freedom From Buddha Nature, starting with: 

Merits(punya/the good deeds) as well as the bad deeds can be transferred/dedicated(anumodana) to others. But there is an element of action involved at the receiving end. For example; someone commits a noble deed and transfers that merit to me. To receive the merit, I should endorse and acknowledge the action. This is usually expressed as "Sadhu! Sadhu! Anumodami". Same applies for evil deeds. 

Here is how I see this: First off let's not forget the definition of 'World/Loka'. Refer to Rohitassa Sutta or Loka Sutta 

In short, modern scientists analyze the external universe from quarks to quasars in pursuit of "the ultimate reality". On the contrary, we Buddhists analyze the matter in our sense experience as patavi, apo, thejo, wayo - Mahābhūta to get rid of the dilution (avijja) caused by Vijñāna(~consciousness) projected on Mahābhūta. This is the intention of kayanupassana as described in the great Satipattana Sutta. 

According to Dhammachakka sutta, the first sermon of Buddha, four noble truths are explained in the following sequence: 

If it is difficult to comprehend the explanation given in Aggañña Sutta; how about focusing your energy to understand Loka Sutta, SN 12.44? If you can realize this explanation, there will not be any doubt about Aggañña Sutta. Loka Sutta, SN 12.44 

String of beads can be used in Anussati meditation in sitting or when you are out of meditation to occupy the mind with wholesome thoughts.
