It's pretty unusual for a company to only consider people who've explicitly said they want a role when they're filling that role. What I mean is, when you have so many developers that you need another lead, or when your lead leaves and needs to be replaced, you typically look at all the developers and ask yourself "which of these is ready to be a lead?" If someone who's ready to be a lead has told a manager they don't want to be (because leads work longer hours, or travel more, or go to more meetings, or whatever) then the manager probably won't promote them. But if someone who's ready to be a lead has never mentioned that they actively want to be one, it's not normal for managers to rule them out of consideration. In other words, the fact you never said you wanted to be a lead is not why you weren't made the lead. That said, you should still tell your manager you want to be a lead, and now is a great time to do it, because your manager should still have a reasonably fresh cache of the information that went into deciding where you were on your path to becoming a lead. (In fact, you might be ready already, but there was only one lead job available, and they just happened to choose the other person.) So going and saying that you want to be a lead is a good idea. A better idea is finding out what you need to do to become a lead. A very poor idea is conveying your disappointment that you weren't made lead, especially if you phrase it as being disappointed you weren't considered, which implies that anyone who considered you would choose you. Here are some good questions to ask.

Nothing confines you to a single medium. You can start with a phone call, since unlike an email you know you've reached the person, and you can take some notes during the call. Then you immediately send a confirming email, listing what equipment they have and what's going to happen to it. You can track what you get back against that email, and if there are things the user needs to do, such as removing software from their own devices, that you can't track, your email can include a request for them to let you know when they've done it. This also lets you handle the tone thing well - the email can be cold and clinical, a simple list of items and steps and such, because your initial verbal interaction with them can have been a little warmer and supportive. Verbally you can say "I'm sorry to hear you'll be leaving us; it's my duty to take care of this equipment handover; I don't want to intrude at a difficult time; let's just clean this up quickly so you can deal with more important things right now" and other supportive or emotional statements that might not feel right in an email. The departing employee is unlikely to be offended by a "just the facts" email after a helpful phone conversation; they know it's just a summary. As for cc-ing, I wouldn't start with ccs unless it's already company policy to do so (in which case you wouldn't be asking.) If you need to ask again 3 days later "I still do not have the phone" then sure, cc the boss of the departing person, or HR, or someone else who might either pressure them to hand it over or explain to you why some exception has been granted in this case. Finally don't stay on email once you've switched there - if someone is resisting then not only calling them but going and visiting them can be very useful to either get them to comply or to show to your bosses that you did everything you could. 

I'd like to give you another perspective on this one. Your boss was in the office at 1am on a Sunday. That's not really normal. It may be at your firm, but it isn't anywhere else. What's more, he probably hadn't planned to be, because he didn't have his laptop with him. Something came up that he felt he had to solve immediately by sending an email. It didn't have to be from him but it had to be sent right then and there. It couldn't wait till he got to his laptop. So he signed on to your computer and sent the mail. That's not normal either. In the midst of all this, your reaction isn't "why did this person panic? What's going on that couldn't wait? Is the company in trouble or is my boss a panicker who is losing control?" It isn't even "hm, my boss can sign on to this computer any time and look at stuff or imitate me." Those are reactions I would expect. Instead, you rebuke him and tell him not to do it again. He clearly didn't plan to do it this time. Despite your phrasing in your question title "is sending", this sounds like a one-time thing to me. If your boss has a good reason to be all "it doesn't matter whose computer or email it was, they are all mine anyway and it was a crisis!" then your bigger question is "was it really?" If it was, evaluate whether the company is likely to survive it and how you can help, including removing your disapproval of emergency measures like sending emails from the nearest handy account. If it wasn't, think about whether you want to work for someone who panics, takes emergency measures when there is no crisis, and gets all defensive and gruff when you call him on it. 

I would suggest taking whichever job you would prefer long term in case you do not get the dream job. In my experience, interviews for office jobs ask things like "where do you see yourself in 5 years?" and interviews for retail and restaurant jobs do not. However, if you are asked about your commitment to managing the restaurant or whether you would like to move from part time to full time at the retail store, tell the truth. If they care enough to ask, you owe them the truth. Assuming they don't ask, or are ok when you say something like "I'm not sure, I like this work but am also interested in working at [dream job]", and you're hired at the stopgap choice, then commit to the job while you have it. Work towards the dream job while also being good at the job you take. If and when you get the dream job, give your notice at the stopgap job, apologize, and tell them you got an offer you couldn't refuse. They may be irritated but I doubt you'll have any long term consequences. 

This is why you have a boss. It may also be why this person is leaving. You have two separate things you need: 

[We already had a no-overtime-without-permission and all-overtime-is-paid-overtime policy, to reduce burnout and make sure we knew if someone was struggling.] All the non-stay-and-play people were made much happier when this was implemented, and the stay-and-play people weren't really that ticked off. They knew they had pushed it too far. It wasn't a saying back in the day, but this is why we can't have nice things. Nobody was fired or punished, they were just told "don't do that anymore" and the policy was added to our policies. If your workplace doesn't have a policy like this yet, my advice is to do everything you possibly can not to be the person whose behavior causes them to need a policy. 

I have been the boss in this situation. It is never pleasant. Through bad luck, employee mess-ups, my own mess-ups, client misunderstandings or whatever, it is not possible to meet all the deadlines this month. I then make a management decision what to do about it. I don't like it but I do it. And I tell my people what to do. And then one of them comes to me with exactly this stuff: what about my reputation, what about my career, that client is going to think less of me. Yes, I know, it's a bad situation. I hate it too. But are you seriously asking me to lose $50,000 on project A so that you will be less worried about your personal career impact over on project B? Not going to happen. I'm not unaware of the dissatisfaction. I have chosen the path that minimizes total dissatisfaction throughout the whole company. Coming and letting me know that the total I have managed to achieve is nonzero has some value. Demanding I take a different path in order to keep you content, and never mind what happens to everything else, is not ok. Secretly doing the opposite of my plan so that you stay content, and again never mind what happens to the rest of the company, is also not ok. Which will be worse for your career and reputation 

I would simply tell them that I have decided to move to their city. Whether it is to be with a fiance, to care for an aging parent, or simply because you prefer the weather, scenery, and nightlife is not relevant. It is worth mentioning that your job search is not related to not liking your current job. But I would caution against over-revealing your personal life. Imagine if an interviewer worries that if you break up with your fiance you will move away again. The less you reveal the less they can use as a reason (not related to your abilities) to hire you. 

I would discuss this with whoever you submitted the application to. There's no way to ask the person at the target company whether to discuss this or not without discussing it, and all you know is that the person "may be involved" in evaluating candidates. Anyone who is trusted with that responsibility can also be trusted not to blurt out details of your plans to your current employer, so there's no real need for you to talk to this person first. I don't think anyone there will say "this candidate is excellent, and one of our evaluators has even met with this candidate in a professional capacity and was impressed, but you know that's kind of an unfair advantage isn't it, so let's hire another candidate who is not as good." But if you are worried, you could let the person you applied to reassure you about that. It isn't going to help your prospects, your current employer, or the firm you hope will be your new employer for you to miss this meeting, so you just want to make sure nobody thinks you are sneaky. And finally, in the meeting, do a great job for your current employer. The slightest hint of "wink-wink nudge-nudge I'm sure we can give you generous terms" and the new people won't hire you and the old ones won't want you any more either.
