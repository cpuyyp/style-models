The grid definition on your input file needs to be recognized by cdo. To test, whether it is recognized you can try 

What does 'nitrogen' mean? Nitrogen might mean gaseous $N_2$. It might also mean compounds, which contain nitrogen, such as nitrate, ammonia and ammonium. $N_2$ $N_2$ cannot be metabolized by most plants because it is to inert. You need bacteria or plants (e.g. Legume family plants) to perform nitrogen fixation. During this processes the $N_2$ is converted into bio-available compounds such as ammonia. If these plants/bacteria are not present, the $N_2$ is useless and does not increase the fertility. Nitrate and Ammonium/Ammonium Ammonium and nitrate can directly be 'used' by plants and soil bacteria. Therefore, if we provide these compounds, we increase the fertility. Summary Generally, 'nitrogen' does not increase the fertility of soils but depends on how it is bound - elemental or in a bio-available form. Therefore, 'nitrogen' does not necessarily increase the fertility. In contrast, nitrogen fixing bacteria do increase the fertility of the soil (also long as $N_2$ concentrations in the atmosphere are as high as present). 

Now, we want to extract a time slice (all spatial values at one time step) and a space slice (all temporal values at one location) from our data. In the second case we get a time series (could be a time series of model data). In the first case we get a picture of the current situation (could be for a map). The blue and green markings in the figure below indicate the time and space slices. 

Usual salinity and solubility of NaCl An usual salinity in the world's major oceans is 35 g/kg. The solubility of sodium chloride in water is around 360 g/kg (Sodium Chloride, Solubility in water). Therefore, the solubility is not the limiting factor. Sea salt consists mainly of sodium chloride (NaCl). Therefore, this approximation should be OK. Mixing of salt and water The salt in the sea water 'moves together' with the water. Thus, when warm water flows from the equator to the poles it transports salt to the poles. At the poles water cools down and sinks (together with salt). If we had a direct relation between sea surface temperature and salinity, in some region we would need a net flux of salt in the opposite direction to the water net flux. Global salinity gradients Global salinity gradients exist. The salinity is above the global mean salinity in some regions -- particularly in warm regions --, whereas in other regions the salinity is below this mean. These salinity gradients are caused by a net loss of oceanic water (evaporation > precipitation + fresh water inflow; enhanced salinity) in warm regions and by a net input of water by (evaporation < precipitation + fresh water inflow; reduced salinity), respectively. These gradients are not related to solubility of salt. 

The meteorological input data files for AGNPS model (Agricultural non-point Source Pollution Model) are actually called climate input data, although the files contain short term meteorological data. All the provided programs are Windows executables. 

If it prints out the correct grid definition, then everything is fine. If not, you need to correct the definition of your lon-lat grid. Please have a look in the respective section below for details. The is a file, in which the target grid is described. If your target grid is a nicely defined grid, you can write this file by hand. E.g. it could look like (copied from the HTML manual of cdo): 

In addition, the compression will differ when you change the chunk sizes. The background is similar as described in the Shuffle section: depending on which values are neighboring each other, the one or the other chunking might be favorable. Now to your question: what's the best choice of chunk size? focus on usage It depends on your data usage and you access pattern. If you often extract time series at specific locations, it might be favorable to define the chunks in a way that the values corresponding to one location are close to each other aligned in memory. But be careful, some software like cdo access the netCDF data always in the same way - independent of what you do with it during the processing. Thus, if you don't access the file directly via the C- or Fortran-netCDF4 routines but via some other software, the best chunking pattern might not depend on what you want to do but how the software does it ... . Some software might - for example - always read data along the spatial dimensions first, although you want data along the time dimension. focus on compression: The size of the compressed file varies with the chunking layout. The situation is similar as described in the Shuffle section. If the data are more effective to compress in time dimension, the chunking in my example figure above might be favorable for file size (e.g. high variability in space but low variability in time). Chunking summary The best choice of the chunk size depends on your access pattern, on the software you use, on your data itself, and on your focus on access time vs. storage space. Compression level The choice of the compression level depends on your aim. If you just want to store the data (in an archive or where-ever) and have it as small as possible, you might use compression level 9. If you want to access data often and fast, you should choose a lower compression level. We use compression levels up to 4. Above that the reduction in file size is very low (for us) so that we do not have a reason to go beyond. Example: Currently, I work with an ocean model. We have a lot of land in our model domain (roughly 1/3). Compression of level 1 is sufficient to reduce the file size by approximately 95%. However, this is a special case. summary: I tried to give an overview of the features you asked for. The exact choice depends on you particular use case and cannot be generalized. For you, my answer might be too late but I hope that it might help some others. For me, the document you linked helped a lot in the past. 

How can I be certain this is jade. I bought this rock from a thrift store for 40 bucks. I thought it was a bit pricey for what it is..does anybody have any solid tips on how to clean up the unfinished side of the Stone? And what tools can a guy use to carve jade 

The question derives from physically being at various locations around the world and witnessing different colours. I chose to use blue as an example because this is how Earth Oceans are commonly referred by. I do agree that there is various different colour schemes. There are several theories: 

Is there an association with thrust fault or dormant volcanos and quartz veins? Where are quartz veins likely to occur in nature and how are the formed? Is it possible to identify these veins from satellite images. 

Natural gas can occur above and below oil formations however when they occur in the same formation natural gas will sit on top because it’s density per kg/m3 is 800+ and natural gases density is 400+ weight of natural gas weight of crude oil 

Most of the time the ocean appears to be blue because this is the color our eyes see. But the ocean can be many other colors depending upon particles in the water, the depth of the water, and the amount of skylight. The colors we see depend upon the reflection of the visible wavelengths of light to our eyes. The Franklin Institute provides a good explanation of how we see color at $URL$ Chlorophyll estimation Chlorophyll concentrations are derived from images of the ocean’s color. Generally speaking, the greener the water, the more phytoplankton are present in the water, and the higher the chlorophyll concentrations. Chlorophyll a absorbs more blue and red light than green, with the resulting reflected light changing from blue to green as the amount of chlorophyll in the water increases. Using this knowledge, scientists were able to use ratios of different reflected colors to estimate chlorophyll concentrations. Intrinsic Absorption The reason the ocean is blue is due to the absorption and scattering of light. The blue wavelengths of light are scattered, similar to the scattering of blue light in the sky but absorption is a much larger factor than scattering for the clear ocean water. In water, absorption is strong in the red and weak in the blue, thus red light is absorbed quickly in the ocean leaving blue. Almost all sunlight that enters the ocean is absorbed, except very close to the coast. The red, yellow, and green wavelengths of sunlight are absorbed by water molecules in the ocean. When sunlight hits the ocean, some of the light is reflected back directly but most of it penetrates the ocean surface and interacts with the water molecules that it encounters. The red, orange, yellow, and green wavelengths of light are absorbed so that the remaining light we see is composed of the shorter wavelength blues and violets. $URL$ $URL$ 

Do you know the (TVD) true vertical depth of these wells. Are you certain the wells are tapped into an oil formation. Oil wells deplete in the production sense but the mess still remains as well over time oil will seep back into the fractured zone. The clean up and maintenance of equipment would be great. There may also be the presence of other toxic gases such as h2s. Think of a oil spill on land or ocean and the coast of cleaning it up. In my opinion I be very impractical and coastly. In most cases impossible because of the differences in formations Case studies strictly geothermal Geothermal Well References 

Why does the colour of Earths oceans vary? Coast lines around the world appear to have different shades of blue. The further one travels from the equator north or south the deep blue the ocean becomes. Is this effect a result of ocean temperature or salinity? 

So, if we assume that the acquisition program's bottom tracking capability is acceptable, the errors that Posidonia's leaves introduce will be minuscule, because the leaves do not present a large change in impedance and thus will not reflect much of the beam. You're left with deciding whether or not you want to classify the "bottom" of the water column as Posidonia's root mat, which may be several inches thick in a large colony, or the top of the sediment below. This is where your uncertainty will likely lie. What I don't know, and what may be difficult to figure out without some rather clinical testing, is whether or not the root mat provides a strong-enough first return to trigger the bottom tracking. I suspect it would, but I can't say that with any confidence without looking at a controlled test survey. I imagine companies like Odom and Kongsberg do this regularly and might be able to give you a more specific answer. Tobbe also correctly notes that lower frequencies won't be affected as much by vegetation as higher frequencies. If you were going to try to run a bathymetric survey over Posidonia—or any area with high concentrations of seafloor plant life—you would want to consider using a device capable of lower frequency surveys...at the cost of diminishing your resolution. 

This may not answer your question to your liking but there is fairly relevant research on the topic. I think there is still a debate about the causes of the recent (Late Cenozoic) uplift, however. The current dominant theory relates the shallow subduction of the Farallon Plate to subcontinental delamination and increased bouyancy all the way to the Front Range (see @Tbb's answer). This theory essentially states that tectonic forcing is mimicked and in a sense bolstered by incisional unloading and subsequent depositional loading between the two landforms (montane vs. high plains). There has been a lot of research on erosion rates in the Eastern Rockies to test parts of Anderson's theories. It seems that most of the research I remember from learning about this problem in college is not freely available, but the papers in the links above have good summaries and discussions of the tectonic forcing and incision-based hypothesis. 

A good singlebeam acquisition program will allow you to choose the method of bottom tracking. Often these methods are not associated with the first return but rather the "strongest" part of the first return within some specified distance from the last known bottom position. This allows the minimization of error created by, for example, fish swimming in the path of the beam (see image below), and also the weaker first returns of soft vegetation. 

As noted in the comments, this is actually a much more complex question than it might seem at first. Answering fully would require a very involved and technical discussion of single-beam surveying's inherent errors and their causes (water velocity, side slope reflection, highly transmissive hydrocarbon-rich anthropocene silt, and other such complications). I will skip those topics—thankfully, I think—and simply focus on the OP's question of what errors Posidonia sea grass might introduce to a hypothetical singlebeam survey. As such this may be more of a partial answer. Let's say you're using a singlebeam instrument with a fairly narrow pulse angle, like 3º. (Your vessel should not roll too much with this narrow a beam, but it will give higher resolution). You're surveying over a colony of Posidonia on a flat seabed. Posidonia leaves have a density fairly similar to that of the water column. Depending on the frequency of sound you are surveying with, you may get a ping with a slightly different shape from surveying over an area of "bare ground". This is, at least in theory, due to the slight variation in density between the water column and Posidonia leaf blades causing small amounts of reflection and refraction to the sound wave before it hits the root mat and the top of sediment. Just for imagination's sake, I've included the conceptual "bare ground" model below.
