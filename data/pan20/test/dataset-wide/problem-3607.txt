The Timex Runkeeper 2.0 removed some of the features of the 1.0. This watch will NOT record Power data from a cycling power meter. For that I recommend the Garmin 500 Edge. Good Luck! 

(1) and (2) promote good flexibility. (3) through (6) promote stability and balance. The tendency when we get tired or lazy is to droop the lifted leg and/or allow the weights to rest on the ground during the bending portion of the exercise. The other tendency is to use too much weight, which subsequently requires us to put the lifted foot on the ground in between reps. I don't stress about weights in one hand or two. . . I say switch it up to get some variability in the exercise. My best suggestions for correcting these errors are to 1) don't use any weight (at least at first), and 2) use a mirror - your back and lifted leg should be parallel to the ground during the "bend" portion of the exercise. SUMMARY 

Sometimes back pain can be relieved by strengthening core muscles (back included). I recommend a two exercises that will take less than 5 minutes per day to complete: "Stiff Leg Dead lifts" and "Plank". These exercises will target your core. As far as sets/reps/weight, you may receive many and varied opinions. What's most important though is that you don't over stress your body - you are trying to prevent back pain, not cause extra. With that in mind, I offer the following opinion for sets/reps/weight, you may want to consult a health professional before trying: 1) "Stiff Dead Lifts" with LIGHT weight (perhaps 20 pounds). 4 sets of 15 reps. Rest 30 seconds between sets. As the days go by, increase the weight as you feel comfortable. You will notice a dramatic increase in the amount of weight that you can life comfortably in just the first few weeks. Do this 2 or 3 times per week to start off with. 2) "Plank" after your dead lift exercise, do 1 minute worth of the plank exercise in 10-second intervals with 20-30 seconds rest in between the intervals. After a few weeks, you will be able to do 1 minute without any rest at all. 

This topic is still quite debatable and personally, I tend to gravitate more towards the "avoid injury and keep muscle oxigenated" school of thought but I recently read a publication by UT researchers J. Antonio and W. J. Gonyea called Muscle Hypertrophy vs Hyperplasia. They conducted some very interesting experiments with birds. An excerpt of this paper: 

Your friend is misinformed. Copper jewelry will not cause copper toxity. The actual exposure to copper by using a ring is quite minimal and will not cause you any trouble. Copper toxity comes mostly from ingesting copper. So if you eat the ring, then you might be looking at some copper related issues. But by just wearing it the most you will have deal with is a green finger. Information on copper toxicity 

In the words of every trainer out there: cardio, cardio, cardio. Weight training will give you strength but only cardio will burn fat. 

So, according to this experiment, yes. It most certainly does help with muscle growth. But who wants to tie weights to themselves for 30 days? :-) 

It could be joint fatigue from the repetitive movement. Without X-rays and a proper check it is hard to tell. I would try using knee wraps to keep the knee joint aligned. Check them out here: $URL$ 

It's a rowing machine. You sit on the chair and push with your legs against the pads while at the same time pulling the bar with your arms. The round part you see in front is the resistance wheel which you can adjust so that the movement is more difficult. This is a full body workout that incorporates a great deal of cardio. Some people even say that it is one of the most efficient body workouts. I have used it mostly for warm up before a session of weight lifting. Proper way to use a rowing machine 

I thought that this might be something someone has asked before but I cannot find it so here it goes... I am a 46 year old male. Weight 180 and height 5'10. According to every chart out there, I am overweight. However, I physically do not look overweight since I have been working out for over 20 years and have pure muscle. Not a body buider, mind you, but athletic and elongated muscles. I work out 6 days a week doing all kinds of interval, cardio and weight training. There have been times when I dropped the weight to the supposed ideal (I have dropped to 165-175 on occassions througout my life) just to see how it looked on me and what I have found is that not only do I lose strength but I also look extremely thin. And by extremely I mean EXTREMELY thin. Is it that these charts are just plain wrong or is there some way to remain strong (and by this I mean, as an example, to continue to bench 205 lbs, etc.) and still maintain the ideal weight according to the chart? Thanks in advance. 

I personally recommend using the TIMEX RUNKEEPER 1.0 (NOT THE 2.0). Among other things, this watch allows one to: 

I can sympathize with your desire to increase your running cadence. Several years ago I learned that most top mid/long distance runners have a cadence around 180 steps per minute (SPM). While the reason for this rate is outside the scope of this question, I will say that running economy is optimized for most trained runners at around 180 SPM. I read this piece of trivia on a Sunday evening after I participated in a 5k race. I knew that my cadence was well below the 180 SPM rate. So, the next day (Monday), I ran another 5k and forced myself to run at 180 SPM. Surprisingly, I improved my 5k PR by 1 minute without any extra effort. I now run at approx. 180 SPM without thinking about it, but for the first few months, it required conscious effort to maintain that rate. Here are a few of the things that I did: 

Keep back flat. Standing leg slightly bent. During the "bend" don't let the lifted leg droop down (like the man in photo 4). On the recovery phase of each rep, try not to let the lifted foot touch the ground so that you are balancing on one foot for the whole set (this is harder than it sounds). Use light weights (or even no weights) until you can complete a full set without losing your balance and maintain good form throughout. Don't let the weights rest on the ground during the "bend". 

Select an activity (walking, running, cycling, . . . many others). Monitor and record heart rate using a ANT+ HR monitor. Record GPS data. Display speed, pace, distance, and other related metrics. Easily download data to training peaks. 

I understand your dilemma completely. I would recommend the TRX suspension training straps along with one of their general fitness videos. While these are not stretchy "resistance" bands, they do allow you to have a time-effective and complete body workout - provided that you can find a place in your office from which to suspend them. 

I have used the Single Leg Dumbbell Lift (SLDL) extensively during the last year to improve running performance. In my opinion, there IS a correct technique to this exercise that is motivated by the GOAL of the exercise. In my case, the primary goal of this exercise was to improve lateral stability and balance throughout the ankle, knee, and hip, while increasing flexibility. The secondary goal was to increase strength. Therefore, the "right" technique is one that best promotes the development of stability, balance, and flexibility. To me, photos 1, 2, and 3 all meet my definition of the "right" technique. In photos 4, and 5, the individual may be able to lift more weight, but they will not be getting the stability and flexibility benefits. Specifically, I recommend the following for this exercise:
