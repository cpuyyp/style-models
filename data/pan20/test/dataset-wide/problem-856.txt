NO The differences between a brown dwarf and a low mass star are based upon their mass. A brown dwarf does not have central temperatures and pressures to create energy using hydrogen fusion. The mass is too low to create these conditions. A star by definition is an object where energy is created using hydrogen fusion. This happens when the core temperature/pressure are high enough. This requires a higher mass. The exact mass boundaries between planet, brown dwarf and star are not fully determined. They also depend somewhat on composition. Even so there is no real chance of having a brown dwarf more massive than the lowest mass star. The masses could be similar. In terms of orbits: any pair of bodies orbit around their common center of mass (barycenter). They orbit about each other. When the two objects are the same mass the barycenter is half way between them. When say one star is ten times the mass the barycenter is nearer (1/10th the distance) the more massive star. Think of a see-saw with unequal weight people on it. Now the less massive object (say planet) orbits about a much more massive object (star) the barycenter is inside the star. So we can say the planet orbits around the star. In realality they are both orbiting around the barycenter. 

The core of the question has already been answered, but it's still interesting to illustrate just how difficult it is to make a naked eye observations of a the extremely bright nearby galaxy M81. The astronomer Brian Skiff gives an account of his successful naked eye observation of this galaxy here. Now, galaxies of a given brightness are more difficult to spot than stars of the same brightness, because of their extended nature. If the sky is sufficiently dark, then you can see stars as faint as magnitude 8, but you'll still struggle to spot M81 that has a brighness of magnitude 7. The magnitude 7 is an artificial figure obtained by adding up the light that comes from slightly different directions. Also, you only need very slight amount of light polution to make the sky backgound just a tiny bit grey to make the galaxy vanish from view, while the visibility of faint stars remains essentially unaffected. This is because the brighness as a function of the position in the sky in the case of a star has a very strong and narrow peak while in case fo a galaxy, due to its extended nature, doesn't show a big peak. The integrated brightness may be the same for both cases, but the amount of background light you need to make the galaxy invisible is obviously much less than what you need for the star. 

It depends on the kind of star you want to make. Basically, what you really need is hydrodgen; as soon as enough hydrodgen is gathered somewhere and collapse, you end up with a star. But, if you just have hydrodgen, you will get a very massive star, and with a history different than the stars observed in the local Universe. Why so? 

(See this Wikipedia page) The temperature needed for hydrodgen burning is 10 million Kelvin, so that's how hot a star must be to be considered as a star. It needs to get so hot, because else it will fail to burn hydrodgen and will become a "failed star": a brown dwarf. Edit: Surface temperature can be misleading, since the temperature ranges in which lay stars are not populated only by stars, but also by other objects such as hot Jupiters, with surface temperature ranging from 1000 to 3000 K. 

in orbit around the Sun with a sufficient mass so that self-gravity overcome rigid body forces (that assumes a hydrostatic equilibrium) has cleared its neighbourhood. 

That is an intersting question as this is far from being obvious. Actually, for quite some time it was believed that planets should indeed spin retrograde (we can at least track it back to Laplace in his Exposition du Syst√®me du Monde published in 1976 where he developed his nebular hypothesis). How to prove that planet should spin prograde? We'll have to go back to their formation history. Let's start with an ideal case: particles moving in eliptical orbits around a central object of mass $M$, with a proto-planet of mass $m_0$, and rotating in a eliptical orbit. Let's look at what happens at a given point at a distance $r$ from the central object. First, for a planetesimal in a tangential external orbit, then for a planetesimal in a tangential internal orbit. Tangential external orbit We can write Newton's Second Law ${\bf F} = m {\bf a}$ and project it on the current trajectory axis (normal and tangent), knowing that the acceleration is always something like $v^2/R$, with $R$ the curvature radius (that is different from $r$, the distance to the central object). We get for the normal component: $$\frac{GM}{r^2} \cos \alpha = \frac{v_{ext}^2}{R_{ext}^2},$$ $R_{ext}$ being the curvature radius of the planetesimal in an external orbit. For the proto-planet: $$\frac{GM}{r^2} \cos \alpha = \frac{v^2}{R^2},$$ $\alpha$ having the same value for both object, since it denotes the angle between the direction toward the curvature center and the central object and the orbits being tangential at this specific point, where $r$ the distance to the central object is also the same. Therefore: $$\frac{v^2}{R^2} = \frac{v_{ext}^2}{R_{ext}^2}.$$ As $R < R_{ext}$, we have $v < v_{ext}$. Tangetial internal orbit With the same argument, we can show that $v > v_{int}$ (I let it as an exercice; extra bonus point if you do it with the energy conservation law). Consequences If you go in the reference frame of the protoplanet, you will see the internal planetesimal, rotating at a lower speed, coming backward, towards the proto-planet, and the external planetesimal, rotating at a faster speed, coming forward: 

As you suspect the Sun does not have any permanent surface features. Up till 1951 the longest actually observed sunspot group lasted 134 days see $URL$ That duration gives you an idea how long sunspot groups last. There are associated with coronal holes which would last about as long. However, the structure (shape size) of the group and any coronal hole would be constantly changing. Temporary maps are made and there is a heliographic co-ordinate system, with a latitude and longitude. The sunspots show the rotation of the Sun, and so a north and south solar pole can be found. North is in the same side of the ecliptic as the Earth's north pole). Solar longitude is much more arbitary. The zero helographic meridian is defined as the plane (solar pole to solar pole) passing through where the solar equator crossed the plane of the ecliptic (earths orbital plane) at Greenwich mean noon on January 1, 1854. see $URL$ Since then astronomers have just used a constant rotation rate based upon the suns equatorial rotation rate. These are called Carrington Solar Coordinates A similar system is used for the longitude of the gas giant planets like Jupiter and Saturn. 

This is the problem faced by all star map makers and has been "solved" by each map-maker. The solution has some aesthetic considerations if you use purely area Sirius becomes huge ... So instead of using a formula measure up the symbol sizes used in your favorite star atlas for each magnitude range. Check copy-right for your use. 

What you could think at first, regarding the orientation of any planetary system, is that it should be roughly in the plane of the galaxy, simply by angular momentum conservation. But, when you take a look at observations, you see that protoplanetary disks orientation is not what you would expect, with no preferential orientation (protoplanetary disks are embryo of planetary systems, that makes them interesting). In the following figure, the orientation corresponds to the inclination between the line of sight and the rotation axis of the disk. 

In Farihi et al. (2013) (it's a Science paper, unfortunately I'm not sure its content is freely accessible), they actually measured metal excess in the white dwarf GD 61 (for an astronomer, everything that is nor hydrogen neither helium is a metal). Due to high surface gravity in white dwarfs, any heavy element should sink rapidely in its atmosphere; therefore, they infer that, if you find traces of metals, it means that it comes from accreted material, "polluting" its atmosphere. So if you find oxygen in a white dwarf spectrum, you know that it has to come from somewhere else, and if the white dwarf has a circumstellar disk, it has to come from planetesimals that are accreted from the disk. Now, what they did was to measure abundances (or upper limit for their abundance) for a bunch of chemical elements (O, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Fe) and carbon. Then, they could infer different things to determine the total oxygen budget: 

In addition to the capture mechanisms mentioned by Andy, you also need to take into account the stability of any orbit due to perturbations from tidal effects. E.g. in case of our Moon, there are no stable orbits possible. Every satellite put in orbit around the Moon had had to implement course corrections to prevent it from prematurely crashing into the Moon. This effect explains why you don't have a lot of dusts and rocks in orbit around the Moon due to the large number of impacts. What happens is that after an impact you do get a lot ejecta, a small fraction will then collide with each other so that they get in an orbit around the Moon. But on the long term the tidal effects of the Earth and the Sun causes perturbations until the orbit crosses the lunar surface. 

The ratio of oxygen isotopes of lunar rocks are almost identical to those of Earth. Lunar recession due to the tides which causes the Earth's rotation to slow down, means that just after the Earth formed, the Moon was very close to the Earth and the Earth was rotating very fast. This situation can be reached due to an oblique impact that transfers a lot of angular momentum to the Earth. The formation of the planets is known to have proceeded via small objects growing larger by colliding with each other, this means that the last stages of planet formation would have involved collisions between large objects. It is to be expected that around the time the Earth was taking shape, there could also be a proto-planet at the Lagrange point 60 degrees away from Earth in the same orbit. On the long term this is an unstable situation which ends with a collision that according to simulations is of the sort that typically leads to the formation of the Moon. The asymmetry in the geology between the far side and the near side of the Moon. (there are many more maria on the near side compared to the far side). If the Moon had indeed been very close to the Earth after it formed, then the near side would have stayed very hot due to the Earth's surface still being molten and the radiant heat affecting the near side of the Moon. An impact on the near side of the Moon would far more easily be able to penetrate the solid crust and cause magma to flow to the surface compared to the far side of the Moon. 

Yes it is possible to predict the path of an asteroid, and if it will strike the Earth. In the first instance the accuracy of the predicted path depends upon the quality and spacing of the positional. The better the position measurements (minimum 3) the better the prediction. If the position measurements are spread around the asteroids orbit, the predicted orbit is more accurate. The second factor is more subtle. Because the solar system has many planets, there are many forces on an asteroid. These cannot all be put into an exact solution but need to be calculated step by step. The uncertainty in the predicted path accumulates the further into the future you push the predictions. When an asteroid makes a close pass to a planet a slight difference in the approach can make a large difference in the path after approach. Jupiter being the most massive planet alters the orbits of a lot of asteroids and comets. There are projects to find and measure the positions of asteroids that could strike Earth. Look up SpaceGaurd. It is because of these uncertainties that NASA etc give a probability of an asteroid hitting Earth on it's next close approach. Comets are more difficult, because as gas/dust leave the comet it acts like a rocket engine and so moves the comet off its predictable path. The effect is small but noticeable. Classically, the positions of asteroids is measured by taking an image and measuring where the asteroid is on the image relative to stars with accurately known positions. Sounds simple, but needs skill to do well, and the help of good software to take into account like distorts caused by the telescope/camera optics ... The calculations also involve knowing the location of the Earth and camera, relative to the stars. 

What is it? An IMF, $\Phi(m)$, is defined such as $\Phi(m){\rm d}m$ gives the fractions of stars with a mass between $m - {\rm d}m/2$ and $m + {\rm d}m/2$, and with a normalized distribution $$\int_{m_{\rm min}}^{m_{\rm max}}m\Phi(m){\rm d}m = 1\ M_{\odot}.$$ Note that these boundaries ($m_{\rm min}$ and $m_{\rm max}$) are ill-defined, but typically of the order of 0.1 $M_{\odot}$ and 100 $M_{\odot}$, respectively. IMFs The various IMF used are the following, with their main characteristics: 

There is no "orbital path" detected, that's why it is a "free-floating planet". There is no radial velocity mesured, but the informations given by its kinematic location show that it belongs to the beta Pictoris group, that is a stellar group. For more dirty details, have a look at the submitted paper on PSO J318.5-22: $URL$ Comment: Apart from that (the following reflects my personal opinion) the term "free-floating planet" is ill-chosen; it is clearly a very low-mass object, but since it is not orbiting around another larger object, it seems to me that the term "planet" is not pertinent. I think that it should be consider more than a "very low-mass brown-dwarf". The problem arises from IAU definition of a brown-dwarf and a exoplanet, that is probably not well-fitted for this kind of objects (and that is not really physical). You will notice, by the way, that this object is moving in a stellar group, which kind of reinforce my point. 

A "one time only freak accident" is only going to be considered as a likely possibility when scientists gain a deep understanding how life actually arises and on the basis of that can rule out that life will typically arise on Earth like planets in habitable zones. We haven't arrived at that point yet. Scientists will not invoke "freak accidents" to explain something unless there is a lot of evidence that points to that; clearly such assumptions amount to making the assumption that there is no natural explanation, but that has to be justified by other evidence first. 

As pointed out here, the limit of naked eye visibility for people with extremely good night vision is about magnitude 8.5. Neptune at opposition is much brighter at magnitude 7.7, so it should be visible to people with good eyesight. Astronomer Brian Skiff, made an attempt about a decade ago, he failed to spot it. He said that it should be relatively easy to spot from the Southern Hemisphere as it is high in the sky viewed from there. But surely many other people with good eyesight who are capable of seeing faint stars of magnitude 8 or even dimmer who work at the Paranal observatory will have given this a try?
