Somebody said "The tricky part with the concept of God is that [it] is something lying beyond what we can perceive, by definition. If you could completely understand him, you would be on the same level as him (or her, or its!)." I'm sorry, but I can't think that "beyond what we can perceive" makes any sense. I say that because it seems to me that we could have only learned how to use the word "beyond" from cases of usage of "X is beyond Y" in which both X and Y stood for things we COULD perceive. So I don't know why we should think it would automatically make any sense when we can't even perceive anything that Y could stand for. 

Anselm's alleged definition is: "God is a being than which none greater can be imagined" That's the same thing as saying: "Nothing greater can be imagined than the being than which none greater can be imagined" So my question is: "What being are you talking about imagining"? If your answer to that is Anselm's alleged definition, i.e., "a being than which none greater can be imagined" Then you are saying "Nothing greater can be imagined than a being than which none greater can be imagined" Then I say: All the beings I am able to imagine are finite sized material beings, such as human beings. Are you saying "God is a finite-sized material being?". So I am unable to imagine anything that these words could be talking about, and if I can't imagine anything that has been talked about, then I have only heard some sounds spoken, read some ink squiggles or some lit pixels on a computer screen. So Anselm's alleged definition is not a definition at all because it doesn't tell me any being to think of, and if you can't think of anything for some words to refer to, then all you have are some words. 

I'm just getting seriously into Nietzsche. What I can answer in response to your question is that you might want to look to the Presocratics for answers. Nietzsche was a philologist, and his specialty was in linguistics. He admired the Presocratics (and the Sophists) and despised Plato. If he might refer to in any ancient society, it will most likely be Greek society. However, I think it is more important not to conflate Nietzsche's ideas with historical facts. In many cases he uses words interchangably to denote the same thing. For instance, he often uses the word 'Jew' or 'Jewish ideas' to denote what is essentially Judeo-Christain ideas and moral philosophy. They have nothing to do with the people per se. Thus, if you try to find a resemblance to facts in reality to what he writes, you run the risk of mis-interpreting him. One important thing in that passage you referred to is that he is simply relating ideas of 'purity' to certain physical activities in primitive man (or humans). It need not refer to any group or society. What he is saying is that notions or concepts of purity stem from a certain physical fear of unhygienic-ness or dirt. It has nothing to do with a priori concepts of 'pure' or perfection, which is what Christain moral philosophy posits. In other words, Nietzsche is saying that there is a biological/social origin to these concepts which, after many generations, got lost and became thought of as pure by later society, which have forgotten or misconstrued where it originated from. That is the purpose of the genealogy, to link concepts of pure, perfect, the moral uprighteousness that is an intrinsic part of christian moral philosophy, and to undermine it by linking it to an intrinsically biological/social process, that over time, was inverted from what it initially was: a fear of the dirty, unclean etc. - a very primitive, raw human basis from where it came from. 

Your IQ being below average is evidence that you're not good at IQ tests. There 's no particular reason to think it means anything else. Kant is not a good philosopher to start with. Part of the reason is that his stuff is difficult to read. As a result, there's a lot of argument even about what he was saying. There are philosophers who wrote in plain English and have interesting stuff to say, such as William Godwin: $URL$ Bastiat $URL$ $URL$ Karl Popper, Ayn Rand and David Deutsch all write stuff that is mostly plain English and has good content that you can look up on Amazon. See also $URL$ 

Unfortunately for you, the principle of uniformity is strictly irrelevant to the problem of induction. Induction is allegedly a process of working out what is true from observations. The mere fact that the laws of physics are universal doesn't allow you to work out anything from past observations because it doesn't anything specific about exactly what remains uniform. For example, the universe at some times in the past was a lot hotter than it is now. So the laws of physics don't say the temperature of the universe is uniform over time. So you can't say "because the temperature of the universe at some past time was 5000K, the temperature now and in the future is 5000K." To understand what is going to be uniform you would have to know the laws of physics, but you're trying to explain your knowledge of the laws of physics, so the principle of uniformity does induction no good. In reality, scientific knowledge is created by guessing solutions to problems and criticising the guesses until only one is left and it has no known criticisms. 

Consider your first scenario. You question if an instantaneous state can lead to good outcomes. The answer a Consequentialist will tell you is no. There are no good outcomes where time for reasoning is not allowed. Consider your second and third scenario (which are inverse propositions). A consequentialist will tell you it depends. The length of time do not affect the amount of possible outcomes, because the possible inputs are infinite at any point of time. Thus, at any point of time, use the greatest possible information that are relevant to the consideration in mind. Keep in mind the difference between 2 things. There is the point of time in which you choose as your 'function'. And there is the amount of inputs, which ranges. However, at any one point of time, you are given only one set of inputs and a specific evaluative criteria, taken from the point of view of an actor. If in that shorter period of time leads to worser outcomes than the longer period of time, both using the same set of criteria to evaluate the value of outcomes, then a Consequentialst will not go ahead with that action. Again, it depends on what criteria you use to evaluate the outcomes. Some consequentialists will say it is greater happiness, some will say it is greater security. Your outcome will depend on this evaluative criteria. If the consequences in the longer period of time justifies and overrides the negative consequences in the shorter period of time, then the consequentialist will go ahead with it. Consider your fourth scenario. You consider groups. You cannot simply add the inputs together because the evaluative criteria (the equation) changes. How would a consequentialist deal with this? Ignore the individual actors totally and consider the group. Determine the evaluative criteria and inputs possible for this group that you choose, and draw the function. You will get the answer. The questions you raise are not new to Consequentialism as a moral theory. There are mainly two types: 'Act' and 'Rule'. Act consequentialism says that the rightness of the act depends on what the individual knows at that point of time, and choose optimally upon. Rule consequentialism says that it is the group's, or more complete information, that should determine the rightness of acts. This is the subjectivist vs. objectivist concern. 

Neither values nor any other knowledge are derived from anything. Any purported derivation relies on premises and rules of inference that could be in error. Rather, knowledge is created by noticing a problem with current knowledge, proposing solutions to that problem, criticising the solutions until only one is left and it has no outstanding problems. See "Realism and the Aim of Science" by Karl Popper, Chapter I and "The Beginning of Infinity" by David Deutsch. Another comment: 

The Objectivist position is that it is rational to act according to correct moral standards. Some people may be irrational, but that does not make what they do right. You continue: 

What you have written about the uncertainty principle is false. In quantum physics, a system can be described in terms of Hermitian operators that change over time and these are called Heisenberg picture observables. When you do a measurement the result you see is not an observable but rather a real number that corresponds to one of its projectors. The reality that exists before the observations is described by the Heisenberg picture observables, not by a single number. See $URL$ and $URL$ I don't understand what position you're trying to refute since you haven't explained it and for all I know that position may be wrong, but your argument against it is wrong. 

To demand that someone prove a negative statement is always irrational! Why? Because if somebody says "X does not exist?" he/she is saying "I know of no reason to even suspect in the least that X exists". So what are you going to say to the person who says that? Surely not "Prove that you don't know of any reason to suspect that X exists"!! What could be more irrational than "Prove that you don't know something that I know!" or "Prove that you are ignorant of something". What could be stupider? 

If there is, I wish someone would explain it to me so I could have it too. I have no idea or concept of anything that could be labeled "a concept of God". I have searched my head for an idea or a concept that I could honestly label that. However, all the alleged definitions for "God" seem to amount to "God is that which created (or caused) everything but God", which is circular. If one can have no concept or idea of anything that a sequence of alphabet letters or sound such as "God" could refer to, then what has he/she other than -- that sequence or sound? 

No sentence exists before it is completed. A self-referential sentence speaks as though it already exists as a sentence -- even before any sentence exists to refer to as "this sentence". Thus it would have to "pre-exist its own existence" in order to be meaningful. So self-referential sentences are meaningless. 

Your question leads directly to 2 important considerations. First, whether the physical laws we discover through science are merely 'resemblances' - that they reflect but are not actual natural realities; and Second, that the laws of physics do reflect physical content or constituents themselves as it is like in nature. This in turn depends on your own metaphysical view of what is possible to be known by the human senses. The problem with the term 'Laws of Nature' that is often used in science today (or in textbooks) is that it is a misleading way of putting what in actuality are our best theories. These theories are what, after multiple tests and confirmations, verified as they are separately in experiments, are considered to be true because they give us the best results. They are not considered final. In this sense, 'Laws' as they are used, are actually tentative theories, they are not the final say in any descriptions of reality. This is because even the most well tested and described laws, such as Newton's Laws of Motion and gravitation, have limits. For instance, after Einstein, the laws do not give predictable results at high speeds or small quantities. Thus, Laws can never be Laws in our modern sense of certainty because they are incomplete. They raise further questions about physical phenomena that require further experimentation and testing. These questions are raised when we synthesize it with other laws that we know from other experiments, or from before. For example the recent discovery of the Hiigs Boson can be considered a result that has been built upon not just our knowledge of quantum mechanics, but also our understanding of electromagnetism and classical mechanics. The lack of a unifying theory does not mean that we do not understand nature. Often, we are dependent on these theories to built upon our understanding of reality and nature. It is fundamentally important then to distinguish between the metaphysical question of whether nature can really be discovered as it is by our senses, and whether there are laws of nature that are scientific theories to be discovered through experimentation, that are dependent on our senses. 

I would recommend that you read good philosophy. For philosophy of science "Realism and the Aim of Science" by Karl Popper, "The Fabric of Reality" and "The Beginning of Infinity" by David Deutsch. I do not recommend university philosophy courses. I have seen philosophy lecturers give entire courses on epistemology while completely ignoring Popper, who refuted most of what they said. I had one philosophy tutor say to me that an argument I made refuting something his favourite philosopher said could not be true because the argument I gave was written before the idea it refuted, as if it is impossible for his favourite philosopher to reinvent a bad and broken idea. 

This updating process is impossible since there is no measure on the set of all possible theories. To get such a measure you would need an explanation of its relevance. That explanation would have to come from outside Bayesian epistemology. And so Bayesian epistemology would be incomplete. There are many other problems with Bayesian epistemology, see "The Beginning of Infinity" by David Deutsch, Chapter 13 and "Realism and the Aim of Science" by Popper, Part II, Chapter II. 

I'm not entirely clear on why anyone would say that something that has not been explained (consciousness) cannot be simulated by a computer. I am not aware of any clear statement of what problem is solved by postulating qualia in the sense you gave above. If you haven't explained consciousness and don't have a clear statement of the problem, then you can't have an argument for saying that consciousness can't be simulated. You might want to read "Godel, Escher, Bach: an Eternal Golden Braid" by Douglas Hofstadter if you haven't already. It is true that no explanation of how consciousness is instantiated in the brain has been given. It is also true that no explanation of what sort of program could simulate consciousness has been given. I think it is also true that both Dennett and his critics have some bad philosophical misconceptions that may obstruct their efforts. For an article that describes some of the problems, see $URL$ Dennett and other people working on this areas also have problematic moral ideas that might pose a problem, see "The Meaning of Mind: Language, Morality and Neuroscience" by Thomas Szasz. 

Update: Regarding the first scenario, there is a school of thought, 'Intuitionists', who will say that instantaneous states do not lead to worser outcomes because one can consider past experiences as helpful to making decisions. 

Empirically, no. In our imaginations, yes. That is essentially what you have referred to in the conception by children from images and symbols which seem to refer to their existence. You cannot prove an ideal conception conceived purely from objects situated in reality. For one could almost conceive of any imaginary object if we put them together. Consider what David Hume says, that there is a difference between 'matters of fact' and 'relations of ideas', in Chapter 4 in his Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding. To simplify, matters of fact are things that, no matter what word we assign to it, are true in this world because they exist. They are established by evidence, which in turn are presaged upon 'cause and effect'. Relations of ideas are when, based on certain ideas we hold in our mind, establish them to be true by the mere thought of it. This includes mathematical and geometrical ideas, but also ideas we put together from different 'matters of fact'. That is, things that we hold true from evidence. So Santa Claus is a combination of many ideas from evidence put together as an imaginary whole. The idea of a man in a red costume, with his moose and a some 'human' looking elves, are taken from real life. We distort this picture by making this man and his moose fly, jumping into the chimneys of houses, carrying a host of goods into them (even apartments without chimneys), and give him a sense of humor. This is the imaginary picture we transmit to children, through word-of-mouth and images we draw and enact, therefore to them, there is a possibility that this imaginary figure is real, given that the empirical evidence was not told to them truthfully, but turned into a festive season made real.
