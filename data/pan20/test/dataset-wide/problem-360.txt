Supercapacitors is my answer to you. A supercapacitor is essentially a big battery that discharges (or at least can discharge) a lot of energy in a short amount of time. They are used for short-term energy storage or delivering massive bursts of energy. An example of burst-mode is KERS on racecars. You can use supercapacitors to store energy when braking and keep said energy for the next straight-away if you need a speed boost. 

These solutions aren't mutually exclusive. Obviously, this only works if your justice system can inflict dissuasive penalties on any offender. 

Because they are alien. Alien means foreign. In the truest sense of the word, that means something that isn't part of you. More than that, it's something you have nothing in common with. So aliens are alien. Language is a barrier humans can creatively avoid. Cultural differences however are, in some cases, irreconcilable. We're all different, we all think differently, and we all have a different frame of reference. Issues have divided people from a same country. So people from different species, what are they odds they would see eye to eye? It's really hard to imagine something truly alien, because that would require you to be alien from yourself. For two incredibly intelligent species not being able to communicate, there would need irreconcilable differences in the way they think. 

It's all convention anyways The simple answer is to pick a point and two orthogonal directions arbitrarily. For instance, the center of your capital island is the point of origin, north is towards the North Star and up is towards any perpendicular direction of your choosing. Once you have north and up, you can infer south, down, east and west. Why so Cartesian? Cartesian coordinates express a point relative to an origin based on three orthogonal axes. In your case, north, east and up are the three axes. Now you take these axes, and do something different. North and east form the polar plane. Up is still up and should be perpendicular to your plane. Now you express coordinates based on: distance to origin, angle on the polar plane (or polar angle, in all 360°), and angle to the up direction (azimuth angle, from -90° straight down to 90° straight up). You now have a spherical coordinate system. Why is this better? There are no arbitrary north, south, east, west, up and down direction. There is however an arbitrary plane, which includes an arbitrary 0° polar angle and coincides with the 0° azimuth angle. Remember, it's all convention anyways. In a 3D space, expressing relative coordinates spherically makes generally more sense than Cartesiannally. You want to know an obstacle is X meters away in that direction. That it is X,Y,Z meters away from a point of origin that you yourself are U,V,W meters away from doesn't seem quite as useful. It's all relative anyways Absolute coordinates (whether Cartesian or spherical, or else) are of little practical use in most cases. In this case, I would advise Cartesian coordinates because it's easier to figure out Cartesian geometry. Relative coordinates make more sense in practice. We experience the world relative to our point of view. You instinctively know where front/back/left/right/up/down is relative to you. Apply the same logic to the ship. In this case, I would advise spherical coordinates. 

Another option is VR. You don't actually go out there to meet new civilisation, explore new world. You just strap a VR helmet and think you do. So the story happens in your mind/in a video game. Come to think of it, Assassin's Creed is science-fiction and all you do really is exploring a VR space that recreates a portion of history. If your character believes they're living an adventure, is it different from actually living the adventure? 

Forget the money angle. Forget the training angle. Forget all the angles. The only question is how do I ensure they aren't turned against me in some way. The short answer is: ya don't. Robots aren't loyal. You programmed them to recognise enemies somehow and shoot them. All it takes if modifying either the enemy recognition part, or the decision to kill part, and suddenly your army is worse than unless. Robots are information leaks waiting to happen. They might hold battle plans, strategies, backdoors to your communication channels. There's no telling how much information your enemy can gather from even a dead carcass. Once they have hands on your hardware, you should consider the whole system compromised. Robots aren't less vulnerable. A localised EMP would be bad news. You might be able to blind them with a simple, dirt-cheap IR blaster. Or maybe you can lock them out by DDoSing their network interface. Being superstrong isn't being better, particularly if you can field an equally strong human with a power armour. You don't want an army of robots that has no allegiance to you. You don't want an army of robots you can't protect from prying hands. You don't want an army of robots that only redeeming quality is brute strength. 

Imagine you have a big honking space gun mounted on your spaceship that launches slugs at a few percents of the speed of light. We'll call that fairly destructive. However if you missed and the slug kept going, it could hit a planet directly behind, or any other object somewhere, sometime. If that doesn't concern you in the least, it does concern the Space Warfare Conventions Treaty which says you should feel concerned. I feel that simply blowing the slug up would create a swarm of shrapnel which I don't feel is a better problem to have. Is there a way to destroy such stray slugs? I'm looking for a solution that can be integrated to the slug, sort of a self-destruct mechanism. 

Reactionless is different from thrustless. You have used both terms and I think you are interchanging them when you shouldn't. Assuming what you really want is reactionless, then I can maybe give you a bit of an answer. To keep it simple, thrust means movement because of Newton's third law (an action creates an equal and opposite reaction). Action: ejecting burned fuel out of your propeller. Reaction: the propeller moves in the opposite direction (aka thrust). If you are following Newton's laws, then making something levitate without thrust would require a lighter-than-air kind of thing. Then you're dealing with Archimedes instead of Newton which is another story. Now that we're on the same page about thrust and reaction, what's the difference thrustless and reactionless? Thrustless means no thrust (something like no action and therefore no reaction). Reactionless means no reaction (i.e. action without reaction, or reaction without action from a certain point a view), which violates Newton's third law. If I'm taking the same example as above, your propeller would move without ejecting burned fuel, which in Newtonian physics this is a big no-no. Yet... welp, things happened. NASA reported a drive generated thrust in a way that is properly violating our laws of physics and should be impossible. Fair warning, as far as I know, the research hasn't been properly validated (or invalidated for that matter) yet and the jury is still trying to understand how and what happened really. It also generated thrust in the micronewton range, which is not a lot. An earlier Chinese experiment report several hundred millinewtons of thrust, though once again jury is still out. The principle of the device however is fairly simple. Take a cavity, send microwaves in it, microwaves generate thrust by bouncing around. The details of how it works are A) above my understanding B) not clearly established as far as I know, so I'll direct you to wikipedia if you'd like to know more. The bottom line is there might be such a thing as reactionless thrust after all. I have no idea if the principle is applicable in larger scale (i.e. to propel aircrafts or giant-floating cities), however with a little bit of magic or sci-fi it shouldn't be too much of an obstacle. The technology doesn't seem extremely advanced either, it pushes more our understanding of physics than it pushes our technical capabilities. Assuming it works as advertised, your reactionless drive would appear as if floating in the air if fired in an upwards direction. But once again, there's still thrust even if it's reactionless. That would be the only way to make levitation plausible that I'm aware of. 

There definitely is a lower limit to how young. Firstly, there are legal considerations to be aware of. You probably can't send minors in space, and you probably can't employ them to be astronauts anyways. Cultural acceptability will also factor in. Secondly, kids in development might experience some weird stuff if they don't have their daily dose of gravity. To my knowledge, we don't know what happens really, so unless you want to find out you'll have to wait until the kids are fully grown. Presumably, you want your astronauts to survive, so the only hard requirement left is not turning into jelly on take-off, on landing or in space, aka good physical condition. If you tick all the boxes, I can't see reasons you can't have young astronauts. You can give them proper training as they grow up, so that's hardly a barrier. 

As for the legal aspects, it wouldn't change compared to how it works today. You have one body that edits the rules of the sport. You have one body that organizes international competitions. Ideally, these are independent instances, though obviously they'll need to talk to each other from time to time. Below that you may have national (I say national, you can replace with planetary/continental/local/whatever) bodies that oversee the national leagues and competitions. If these bodies are members of the higher ruling body, then all the teams adhering to the national body get accessing to international competitions. A good example of that is basketball. FIBA and NBA have different rules on quarters: FIBA quarters last 10 minutes, NBA quarters last 12 minutes. As such, NBA isn't a member of FIBA, and doesn't have access to international competitions organized by FIBA. On the other hand, the Spanish or French national leagues are FIBA Europe members, which gives their teams access to European and international FIBA competitions. At least that's the general idea. 

That sounds like the possibility of permadeath. If the rules allow for deadly contact, then you'd have big beefy dudes throwing themselves at each other, actively trying to hurt. Fatal accidents will happen much more regularly, and that's bad for business. On top of that, if it's non-trivial and extremely painful (at least to watch), it won't make for an enjoyable experience. The bottom line of this is that "bodies are mostly expendable". Would you try something if you would mostly survive it? It's that bit of uncertainty that would make it completely inhumane to pit players in potential deathmatches. I mean, I'm considering clones are living beings and not objects. I'll rest my case, rules should still limit contact in a way that prevent physical harm, however if players have a higher physical threshold, then it might be perfectly legal to play rough without doing harm. So I guess it's not that much of a change in the end. Are you not entertained? You've mentioned that most people aren't bloodthirsty. However, there might be a niche market for that. It will probably be illegal too. Introducing the extreme-death-sport underground circuit. There's only one rule: no rules allowed. 

Things that are unique Whether it's a mineral, a plant or an animal, the only place you know you can find it is . Well you have to import. Alternatively, it is a manufactured good, produced by one company, and that company has only one manufacture. Likely they won't bother building a factory on another because there isn't a big enough market for it. But there are still people ready to import it. Or even alternativelier, you can find a similar product, but you want/need that exact one for reasons. Things that are really, really valuable, like, a lot Or more accurately, you can sell it at a high enough price that you can cover logistics cost, but not too high that nobody will buy it. Ties in with unique really, since anything unique tends to be really expensive as well. If you have to import it from an exotic location and the shipping fees are ludicrous, it only adds to the intrinsic value bragging rights. Rich people typically only care about the price tag. Art is undoubtedly better when it traveled 42 parsecs. Things that are kind of legal but not really Maybe obtainium is extremely easy to find but extremely hard to acquire. Reason number one would be paperwork. If it's regulated up the wazoo then maybe it's easier to acquire illegally. Or if you are up to no good, you don't want the paper trail. Reason number two would be taxes. Maybe your corporation can bypass customs (legally or not), so that shipping fees plus import tax is cheaper than just buying it locally. Or maybe you need it faster than the red tape will allow, so you have to turn to other sources. At any rate, it's probably easier to covertly and illegally import things than covertly and illegally mass produce them. Things that are actually people People like to travel too. Though that depends if you count people as goods. 

Consider offering him a chance to do some good on your term if you catch him, rather than offering the prospect of being dissected in a dark room. Make his downfall more appealing than his continuous running. Honestly, if you aren't willing to kill him or mess his brain up, you'll have to wait until he surrenders of his own free will. It's all about finding a reason why he should do so. 

Living in a slum is a known quantity to you, you've lived there all your life, you understand how it works, you figured how to make the better of it. It's not ideal but you've got your life under control. For starters, changing environment means going through all of it again, which is enough of an hassle for probably most people. But the main course is that you don't know how much better or worse that other environment would be. The pasture always look greener somewhere else, but in reality you have no idea if it is actually better or not in the long term. So why risk what you currently have for something you may not get? If your city has plentiful of cheap robot labour, that begs the question: what happens to other cities without cheap labour? Either their economy collapse because they can't compete, or they focus on high-tech industry and generally stuff that requires actual humans with college degrees. Realistically, in both cases there's a non-negligible chance your situation won't be better or will be much worse. There's also the fact immigrants aren't welcomed everywhere, except when they are filthy rich, extremely smart, and/or world famous. So maybe you don't want to deal with that. What would push people over the edge and convince them to leave would be if their safety is at risk. There could be a war and they don't want to eat artillery shells or suicide bombings. There could be a dictatorship that arrests people for having opinions. IRL, it's a major reason why people risk their lives crossing the Mediterranean to come to Europe. So you also have to avoid that.
