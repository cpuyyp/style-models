[From the comments] The proof of Proposition 13.2.19 in Kumar's "Kac-Moody groups, their flag varieties and representation theory" appears to provide the requested information. 

The dimensions of the stalks of Lusztig's sheaves give the coefficients when a canonical basis element is expanded in a PBW basis. These stalks satisfy a parity vanishing condition. For these positive results, see Corollary 10.7 of Lusztig's "Canonical Bases Arising from Quantized Enveloping Algebras". The first example of a 2-dimensional stalk at zero occurs in type A2, in dimension vector (2,2). If X is the variety of 2x2 matrices of rank at most 1, then it is not hard to see (e.g. using the Deligne construction) that IC(X) is one of Lusztig's sheaves and has a 2-dimensional stalk at zero. Alternatively the canonical basis computation can be carried out, which is implemented in GAP via the package QuaGroup. 

Let $V_D$ and $V_Q$ be the two dimensional simple representations of $D_4$ and $Q_8$ respectively. Let $1_D$ and $1_Q$ denote their trivial representations. Suppose that there is a tensor equivalence between $\mathbf{Rep}(D_4)$ and $\mathbf{Rep}(Q_8)$ commuting with the fibre functor to $\mathbf{Vect}_\mathbb{C}$. This equivalence sends $1_D$ to $1_Q$ (as they're the unit object) and sends $V_D$ to $V_Q$ (as they're the unique simple of dimension 2). In particular there is a $\mathbb{C}$-linear isomorphism $g$ from $V_D$ to $V_Q$. Consider $$g\otimes g:V_D\otimes V_D\to V_Q\otimes V_Q.$$ It must send the unique copy of $1_D$ in $V_D\otimes V_D$ to the unique copy of $1_Q$ in $V_Q\otimes V_Q$. It is easy to see that there is no such $g$. The slickest way I can see to prove this is to note that the flip map $v\otimes w\mapsto w\otimes v$ acts by -1 on $1_Q$ and by 1 on $1_D$. 

Here you are: $$ \begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline 8& 15& 21& 2& 14\cr \hline 20& 7& 13& 19& 1\cr \hline 12& 24& 0& 6& 18\cr \hline 4& 11& 17& 23& 5\cr \hline 16& 3& 9& 10& 22 \cr \hline \end{array} $$ In fact, you may start with any weakly magic square (that is --- with no conditions on the diagonals); then you just need to permute rows and/or columns to satisfy the conditions on the diagonals. I took a standard algorithm of constructing the magic squares of odd order; amazingly, I needed only to permute the columns. It seems that a similar method should work for higher orders as well. 

As in Geoff Robinson's answer, let us show that there exists a square root of $A$ which is a polynomial in $A$; then surely it commutes with $B$. Let $\mu(x)$ be the minimal annihilating polynomial for $A$, $\mu(x)=\prod_i(x-\lambda_i)^{\alpha_i}$. We need to find a polynomial $P(x)$ such that $P(x)^2\equiv x\pmod {\mu(x)}$ (then $P(A)$ is a desired square root). By the Chinese remainder theorem, it suffices to find such polynomial modulo each of $(x-\lambda_i)^{\alpha_i}$, which is the same as finding a square root of $t+\lambda_i$ modulo $t^{\alpha_i}$. This last root can be proved to exist either by simple lifting of exponent $\alpha_i$, or by mentioning that the Taylor polynomial $$ P_i(t)=\sqrt{\lambda_i}\sum_{n=0}^{\alpha_i-1} \frac{\frac12\bigl(\frac12-1\bigr)\cdots\bigl(\frac12-n+1\bigr)}{n!}\biggl(\frac{t}{\lambda_i}\biggr)^n $$ for $(t+\lambda_i)^{1/2}$ fits. This proof works as well if $\mu(x)$ is divisible by $x$ (but not by $x^2$) since $0$ is a square root of $x$ modulo $x$. EDIT. As Geoff Robinson mentioned, my last statement was wrong, so the case when $\mu(x)$ is divisible by $x^2$ needs another methods. In this case, the desired claim is wrong. One may clearly use the statement that each operator commuting with all operators commuting with $A$ is a polynomial in $A$, but here is an explicit counterexample (surely inspired by Geoff). Let $A=\pmatrix{0&0&1\\0&0&0\\0&0&0}$, $B=\pmatrix{1&0&0\\0&0&0\\0&0&1}$. Then $AB=BA$, and there exists a square root of $A$, for instance, $\pmatrix{0&1&0\\0&0&1\\0&0&0}$. On the other hand, since $B$ is the projector onto $\langle e_1,e_3\rangle$, each $C$ commuting with $B$ should have the form $C=\pmatrix{a&0&b\\0&c&0\\d&0&e}$. Now, if $C^2=A$ then $\pmatrix{a&b\\d&e}^2=\pmatrix{0&1\\0&0}$ which is impossible: otherwise we would obtain a $2\times 2$ matrix whose square is nonzero but the fourth power is zero. 

I can't speak for an original motivation, but from a modern (geometric) point of view, the reason the preprojective algebra is an interesting object is that the moduli stack of representations of the preprojective algebra is equal to the cotangent bundle of the moduli stack of representations of the original quiver Q. 

I assume all groups are discrete and ignore Q3. Also I assume that π comes from a group homomorphism from H to G. By Poincaire-Verdier duality π! is the same as π*. Both of these are identified with restriction. Then π* is the right adjoint of restriction, hence is what I would call coinduction, while π! is the left adjoint of restriction, hence induction. In some contexts (e.g. p-adic groups), I've seen the right adjoint be called induction. The dualising sheaf is the same as the constant sheaf, hence corresponds to the trivial representation. 

You can identify $d\phi$ with the map $(X,Y)\mapsto \operatorname{Ad}(g^{-1})(\operatorname{Ad}(t)X-X+Y)$ from $\operatorname{Lie}(G)\times\operatorname{Lie}(T)$ to $\operatorname{Lie}(G)$. Since $t$ is semisimple, $\operatorname{Ad}(t)$ acts diagonalisably on $\operatorname{Lie}(G)$ (passing to an algebraic closure if necessary, which is harmeless). Since $t$ is regular, the 1-eigenspace of this action is precisely $\operatorname{Lie}(T)$. Surjectivity is now clear. 

The following conclusion is true: If $\Phi_{m,n}(x)\in\mathbb{Q}$ for all positive integers n, then x1=x2=...=xn=1. It follows in what I believe is a fairly routine, or at least not too difficult, manner from the following Claim: Let K be the extension field of ℚ generated by all n-th roots of all xi. Then K is a finite extension of ℚ. Proof. Let yi be the N!-th root of xi. Then the power sum symmetric functions of the yi are all rational, hence the elementary symmetric functions are all rational, so the y's lie in a field extension of ℚ of degree at most m. Take N as large as you like. Voila! 

The claim on graphs without $K_5$ is a particular case of the (still open in general) Erdos--Lovasz Tihany conjecture. (Tihany is not a surname, but the name of a peninsula on Balaton lake in Hungary.) This particular case has been proved in W.G. Brown and H.A. Jung, On odd circuits in chromatic graphs, Acta Math. Acad. Sci. Hungarica, V. 20(1), pp. 129-134. In fact, this paper contains more general results. As I already mentioned in the comments, this bound cannot be lowered to 3 even if the graph contains no $K_3$. An example is provided by the Mycielski graph of $C_5$. To see that it does not contain two disjoint odd cycles, notice that each odd cycle either contains the apex and an edge of $C_5$, or contains at least one of any two neighbors in $C_5$. 

The answer to the first question is positive. Consider two graphs on eight vertices each consisting of two disjoint 4-cycles: the first one's cycles are $abcd$ and $efgh$, the second's ones are $afch$ and $ebgd$. The answer for the second question is also positive, even if we consider $\mathcal H(G)$ to be a multi-hypergraph (thus taking neighborhoods with multiplicities). Take any connected non-bipartite graph $G$ and construct two graphs from it: first one is the disjoint union of two copies of $G$, another one is the tensor product of $G$ with an edge. Both have the same neighborhood multi-hypergraph, but one is not connected and another one is. If you need, say, only connected graphs you may also obtain such by augmenting both graphs by a vertex connected to all vertices. 

Let X be an affine variety over ℂ. Consider X(ℂ) with the classical topology, and create the topologists loop space ΩX(ℂ) of maps from the circle into X(ℂ). One can also construct the ind-variety X((t)), whose R-points are given by X(R((t))) for any ℂ-algebra R. Take the ℂ-points of this ind-variety, and give them the usual topology. Is the topological space X((t))(ℂ) thus defined homotopy equivalent to ΩX(ℂ)? Edit: David Ben-Zvi's comment regarding using unbased loops instead of based loops is pertinent. We should be considering unbased loops (L not Ω). This checks out in the case where $X=\mathbb{G}_m$. The affine Grassmannian case also provides positive evidence. Commentary (based on comments): Note that the space X((t)) is not the base change of X to ℂ((t)). It isn't the restriction of scalars either, since $R\otimes \mathbb{C}((t))\neq R((t))$ in general. Regarding putting the classical topology of X((t))(ℂ), one should not be scared of the ind-scheminess. ℂ((t)) has a natural structure of a topological ring, and hence we topologise X(ℂ((t))) in the usual manner, taking the subspace topology using a closed embedding into affine n-space for some n.

Since this question was first asked, nontrivial decomposition numbers for Quiver Hecke algebras (=KLR algebras) have been discovered in finite type. Thus there is an alternative family of examples where the canonical and KLR basis disagree, if one is willing to accept ones algebras living over a field of positive characteristic. Known examples are not always explicated in the literature right now. The historically first example is due to Geordie Williamson - see $URL$ or $URL$ 

[ORIGINAL] The rest of the text shows what happens if we replace $1/2$ by a smaller constant. For $\mathbf x,\mathbf y\in[0,1]^k$, denote by $d(\mathbf x,\mathbf y)$ the minimal total length of a system of (disjoint) segments such that for every $i$, the numbers $x_i$ and $y_i$ lie in one of the segments. Clearly, $d$ is a metric. If we replace $1/2$ by some $\alpha<1/2$, then we are interested in finding many mutually disjoint balls $B_\alpha(\mathbf x)$ of radius $\alpha$ one can find in $[0.1]^k$. For that purpose, it suffices to find many points $\mathbf x^i$ with pairwise distance $>2\alpha$. We will seek for such points of the form $$ \mathbf x^\sigma=\left(\frac{\sigma(0)}{k-1},\dots,\frac{\sigma(k-1)}{k-1}\right), $$ where $\sigma$ is a permutation of $\{0,1,\dots,k-1\}$. Let $V$ be the number of points having the form $\mathbf x^\sigma$ and lying in a ball $B_{2\alpha}(\mathbf x^\tau)$ for some fixed $\tau$; the number $V$ does not depend on $\tau$, since all our points are equivalent via permutation of coordinates. Then we may choose the ``distant'' set of at least $k!/V$ such points, choosing one by one (since each chosen point prohibits at most $V$ points, including itself). So we are to estimate $V$ now, asssuming that $\tau=\mathrm{id}$ and denoting $\mathbf x=\mathbf x^\tau$. Set $\ell=[2\alpha(k-1)]$. Then $d(\mathbf x,\mathbf x^\sigma)\leq 2\alpha$ iff there exists a set of (disjoint) segments of the form $[a/(k-1),b/(k-1)]$ with total length exactly $\ell/(k-1)$ such that $i/(k-1)$ and $x^\sigma_i$ are always in the same segment (we allow $a=b$, in which case the length of the segment is $0$). Such a set of segments can be chosen in ${k-1\choose \ell}$ ways (choosing which elementary segments are covered). Consider any such set with lengths $m_1,\dots,m_s$; then there are exactly $(m_1+1)!(m_2+1)!\dots(m_s+1)!$ points $\mathbf x^\sigma$ ``compatible'' with this set. Finally, notice that for any $m,n\geq 1$ we have $m!n!=m!\cdot 2\cdots n\leq (m+n-1)!$. Thus $$ (m_1+1)!\dots(m_s+1)!\leq (m_1+\dots+m_s+1)!=(\ell+1)!. $$ This means that $V\leq{k-1\choose \ell}(\ell+1)!=\frac{(k-1)!}{(k-\ell-1)!}(\ell+1)$. Therefore, we can choose at least $$ \frac{k!}V\geq \frac{k(k-\ell-1)!}{\ell+1}\geq (k-\ell-1)! $$ points with pairwise distances $>2\alpha$; this number is superexponential in $k$ (since $k-\ell-1\approx[k(1-2\alpha)]$).

Suppose f:X→Y. If I decorate that first sentence with appropriate adjectives, then I get a pushforward map in cohomology H*(X)→H*(Y). For example, suppose that X and Y are oriented manifolds, and f is a submersion. Then such a pushforward map exists. In the de Rham picture, we can see this as integrating a form over fibres. In the sheaf cohomology picture, we can see this via the explication of the exceptional inverse image functor. The question is how else can we think of this pushforward map. I'd be particularly interested in an answer from the algebraic topology point of view, because I'm hoping that such an answer would eludicate the appropriate level of generality in which a pushforward in cohomology exists (perhaps not only answering the question of for which maps f, but also answering the question of in which cohomology theories can we carry out such a construction). 

The size of the double quotient can be bounded by a function exponential in the number of places where KG is not maximal compact. The base of the exponential will of course depend on the kernel of the central isogeny, but all the dependence on the field F can be moved into the implied constant. The part about this that I don't know how to prove is to show that the double quotient is finite in the first place. I can only do this for PGLn, which I think is a worthwhile group to think about for this problem since you can see everything explicitly. Let Z be the kernel of the central isogeny G'-->G. The natural map $G(\hat F)\rightarrow \prod'_v H^1(F_v,Z)$ has kernel $G'(\hat F)$ in which the rational points are dense by strong approximation. This map is surjective, so we can rewrite the adelic double quotient as a double quotient of this restricted direct product of H1's. Now consider what happens when we shrink KG at one place v from a maximal compact to something smaller. Then the cardinality of the double quotient can increase by at most a factor of |H1(Fv,Z)|. To show the desired exponential growth, we simply need a bound on |H1(Fv,Z)| that is independent of v. For Z=μn, we know explicitly $H^1(k,\mu_n)=k^\times/(k^\times)^n$ for any field k and the bound is easy. If G is split, then Z is a product of μn's and there is no more work to be done. For general G, pick a finite Galois extension K/F over which G splits. Then the inflation-restriction exact sequence together with the result for split groups implies the necessary uniform bound on |H1(Fv,Z)|. 

Let me answer Question 2. The answer is in negative: there exists an upper bound for majority coloring numbers of all tournaments. I will not care about the sharpness of the bound. Let $G$ be a tournament on $n$ vertices, and let $d_1\leq d_2\leq \dots\leq d_n$ be the in-degrees of its vertices (denote the vertices $v_1,\dots,v_n$ respectively). We want to find its majority coloring in $3k$ colors. Firstly, notice that the first $m$ vertices induce a sub-tournament with $m\choose 2$ edges. This means that $d_1+\dots+d_m\geq {m\choose 2}$, which yields $d_m\geq \frac{m-1}2$. Now we paint $v_1,\dots,v_{2k}$ with the last $2k$ colors; all the remaining vertices will be painted with the first $k$ colors, so the conditions for $v_1,\dots,v_{2k}$ are satisfied automatically. Each of the remaining vertices has in-degree at least $k$. Consider a random coloring of them in $k$ colors. Now, for each $i>2k$, the probability $p_i$ that at least half of $\mathop{\rm In}(v_i)$ are painted with the color of $v_i$ can be bounded by Hoeffding's inequality as $$ p_i\leq \exp\left(-2\left(\frac12-\frac1k\right)^2 d_i\right)^2 \leq \exp\left(-\frac{(k-2)^2}{2k^2}(i-1)\right) $$ (the estimate may become even better if $\mathop{\rm In}(v_i)$ contains some of the first $2k$ vertices). So the probability that at least one vertex violates the required condition does not exceed $$ \sum_{i=2k+1}^n p_i \leq \sum_{i=2k+1}^n \exp\left(-\frac{(k-2)^2}{4k^2}(i-1)\right) <\sum_{j=2k}^\infty \exp\left(-\frac{(k-2)^2}{4k^2}j\right)\\ =\exp\left(-\frac{k(k-2)^2}{4k^2}\right)\cdot \left(1-\exp\left(-\frac{(k-2)^2}{4k^2}\right)\right)^{-1}. $$ This last bound tends to $0$ as $k\to\infty$, so it is less than $1$ for some value of $k$. This value fits. Remarks. 1. One may try to improve this estimate by making something different with the vertices of low in-degree, e.g., introducing them into a general scheme and computing the sharp values of $p_i$ for these vertices. However, I doubt that a sharp bound may be obtained in this way.
