There is a whole industry of commercial rope access for maintenance etc and the techniques used are related but not identical to recreational climbing and mountaineering. There are also a few individuals who climb buildings for recreation/self promotion. In the commercial case it is usually more about descending from an well established top anchor rather than actual climbing as such. One problem is that climbing a building without permission will probably be illegal. Alain Robert is famous for unauthorised climbs of public buldings but he tends to 'free climb' and it has to be emphasised that this is both illegal and very dangerous. Even he tends to choose structure which are massive, boring ladders. Equally climbing a bilding is likely to be failry tedious as you would want to be absolutely certain that it was within your capabilities (or you will die) and it will just be executing the same moves again and again until you get to the top or fall off so I'm not sure thre is really that much to reccomend it. And as it has now been done before there isn't even that much celebrity to be gained. 

That just looks like forge scale. Those axes are hand forged and during the process oxides build up on the surface of the metal and if flakes of scale get picked up on the head of the hammer (probably a power hammer in this case) they can get driven into the surface of the steel making a shallow indent. You can also get texture where the scale falls off in some places but not others. Axes are pretty overbuilt in terms of material thickness so shallow indents like this on the surface won't make any difference to its performance, strength or durability, especially considering that the stamping is a lot deeper than those pits. A lot of the steel in an axe head is there to make up weight and provide the correct geometry, in fact in many traditional styles use a 3 layer laminated construction with the bulk of the head made up by wrought iron or mild steel to economise on tools steel which was, historically, very expensive. 

Something like this is probably more likely to be marketed as a 'pouch' than a 'mini-backpack'. A search for 'belt pouch' or 'utility pouch' on ebay will get you what you want. 

For serious organised search and rescue there is an argument that you want as much light over as wide an area as you can possibly get as this maximises your field of vision and reduces the area of ground you need to cover on foot. there is also the consideration that a bright light is more likely to pick up a flash of reflective tape etc on a casualty's gear. However there is a counter argument that unidirectional artificial light will never realistically give you the same visual acuity as daylight and at night a bright torch can produce tunnel vision where you only concentrate on the illuminated cone and can ignore more subtle clues from your peripheral vision or other senses. Similarly if you are searching for a casualty who is using a small torch or chemical light to signal then a very bright light may actually impede your ability to spot them. Clearly there are different situations, for example between a small group searching a hillside for a lost hiker vs a long line of people combing a wood for a lost child. There is also the consideration that for a serious search at night on open ground an aircraft with thermal imaging equipment will have the large area/long range aspect covered far better than any search on foot so a foot search may be more concerned with short range vision in dense cover (woods, buildings etc) where light output is less important. 

It depends : A ferrocerium rod will produce more, hotter, larger sparks than a traditional flint and steel and with care you can shave off a small pile of material from the rod without sparking it which can act as an igniter. Ideally you should carry a reasonable quantity of tinder with you in a waterproof container like a tobacco tin, this means that you will always have the means to reliably create a flame. This should be topped up as you go. Obviously once you have got a fire lit you have the means to dry more tinder to replenish what you have used. Indeed there was a time in teh not too distant past when tinder box was the normal way of making fire. A good weather resistant tinder is cotton wool impregnated with Vaseline, tampons are also good as they are very compact and are available individually wrapped. A good habit is to collect any good tinder you find on the trail as you go if it is a bit damp you can keep it in an inside pocket and dry it out with your body heat throughout the day. There are plenty of good sources of natural tinder, some work well as they are, others may need a bit of preparation. In Europe bracket fungus has along history as a tinder and many other fungi and lichens will also work well when dry. Partially rotted wood from resinous woods can also be good and pine sap can be an effective accelerant if not an actual tinder per-se. Often natural tinder will need a bit of preparation. Usually it is enough to scrape the surface with a knife or rock to produce a fine powder which will catch a spark more easily. You may also find that with natural tinder some is good at catching spark and you then need something a bit more fibrous to get a flame from the resulting ember. You can also make good tinder from char-cloth this is obtained by partially burning cotton (or similar plant based textiles). You can make this in bulk by heating cotton in a partially sealed container or just carry a roll (like a bandage) and it should charr itself as you use it. Obviously a lot depends on the environment you are in and it is well worth experimenting with anything which looks likely before you really need it. 

Fixed length non-adjustable trekking poles have the advantages of being lighter, comprise of less failure points and sturdier (especially for cheap poles). On the other side of the medal, transporting them by airplane is more costly and they can be inconvenient when hitch hiking to/from a trailhead. I have used slightly longer fixed trekking poles in order to be able to use them with my shelter system. I personally did not mind adjusting my hand on the long handle depending on the inclination of the trail. In fact, if they would have been non-fixed I would seldom adjust them as it takes time. I prefered fixed length poles because of their weight and not having to adjust them every time I setup my shelter. I do not use loop handles so this wasn't a problem for me. If you prefer quick adjustment and fixed-length; an interesting compromise are the Black Diamond Z-Pole Series trekking poles. They are fixed and collapsible for the most part. The top-most section allows you to adjust it to your liking. 

If you can settle on purple Nunatak and Feather Friends have good sleeping bags in those colors. One option could be to get a custom made sleeping bag from the cottage industry. Many will accept custom orders although they may not have something available in pink. 

According to wildwoodsurvival, the sand helps remove suspended particles. Charcoal helps to remove chemical impurities. The charcoal plays the role of active carbon. The water filtration process use multiple materials, from coarse to fine, to prevent clogging. As a last stage, the charcoal can also help remove some bacterias. Note that the author of the video recommendeds this method solely for water filtration and not water purification. 

The answer is no, you may only camp in designated areas. Camping is only allowed in designated areas at Jasper park. If you contact the park directly by e-mail the answer is the following: 

One option is to ask the land owners. In an attempt to answer your question... According to the Outdoor Magazin: 

As to answer what areas may be more likely to allow backcountry camping, I usually look at the two following things. If you are unsure where to start, I would consider any long trails in the vicinity of where you want to backpack. Popular long trails, such as the AT, PCT & etc. allow you to camp mostly anywhere around the trail. There are some exceptions but these are fairly well documented on their respective websites (AT, PCT). You should be able to figure out the details for each individual trail and their specific areas. Typically, you can avoid the more restrictive areas. Some long trails, such as the JMT, have more restrictions and may not be a good option. Looking at a top 10 list may provide you with some inspiration. Secondly, I like to look at National Forests because they usually have less restrictions if any at all (e.g. don't stay at the same spot for > 2 weeks). In many cases, you can camp just about anywhere in national forests. In some places, e.g. in California, they may still require a permit. 

In Canada, you will need a hunting license depending on the province (or territory) and type of game you wish to hunt. Typically, a safety course is also required. For example, moose requires applying for a draw which is valid for a certain zone as determined by the department of natural resources. 

Mold can be harmful to your health and damage the waterproof fabric of your tent. Mildew stains shouldn't necessarily be removed as it can damage fabrics. However, growth of mold should be stopped. It is best to consult your tent manufacturer documentation to know what's the best treatment for your specific product. According to MSR's How do I prevent mildew?, 

It is worth nothing that if you have a cooking system and the extra fuel you can prepare hot water and place the hot water bottle between your legs to help you keep warm. If you have extra food, eat a high-energy snack before going to bed. Other things that comes to mind are: cover your head, use what you can as bottom insulation, make sure you don't overheat and sweat. 

During the fall season, fallen leaves from deciduous trees such as maple, oak, etc. can be found in abundance. Dead leaves can be gathered and placed under your sleeping system in order to sleep more comfortably and presumably warmer. How much R-value does a pile of leaves provide? This is of course dependent on the type of leaves (or composition), quantity, dampness and other factors. Considering the possible variation, what level of R-value could you expect by gathering dead leaves? 

A reference article can be found here. One pot for which I would have reservations is the grease pot. It is not made of titanium but is light, cheap and not meant for cooking. :) 

Katahdin is the highest summit in the area and camping is not permitted. Surrounding mountains are not very high and you should be able to camp at the bottom of them with some minimal planning if you're concerned about the temperature. A 30F bag is most likely what you will end up using and I would bring that with a few extra light layers that I can use during the day and at night if needed. e.g. a light puffy & windbreaker pants. If you use lean-to's, these can something feel colder because they are fully open on one side. I have used a 40F quilt in Baxter State Park, in early July, without any trouble. 

Yes it does dry shoes much faster. When long distance hiking it is definitely a nice thing to be able to stop in town and dry your shoes overnight using newspapers. It will draw a lot of the dampness right out of your footwear. This is a known trick and many people will attest to its magic. 

These three tents are very similar; freestanding, double-wall dome construction. The limelight is a bit heavier with more floor space. The trail light does not have a transversal pole. Any of them should do just fine. I used a similar tent, the MSR Hubba Hubba, for a while and was quite satisfied with the design. I now retired the Hubba Hubba in preference of a Stratospire 2 as it is more lightweight and spacious (also cheaper compared to the Hubba Hubba). However, it is not freestanding and require trekking poles instead of DAC poles.
