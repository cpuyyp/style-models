Only time I ever, comfortably did a full Chinese, legs-out-to-sides-split (also "straddle-" or "side-splits"), was at a yogic dance celebration through music and yoga of "TriYoga". I had gotten much warmer than in any class with the dancing to live music (and maybe an ambient temp. of ~80F. However, both before and since that time, no matter how much time I spent at home or in classes, I was never quite able to get my muscles warm enough to comfortably roll from font-to-back w/legs straight out (sigh). But again, as in whether you stretch (at all) and in how much, time of day and consistency of temperature when stretching correlate higher than almost any other factor in injury prevention (both during stretching and during later exercise practice). Whether or not you need stretching depends on how often you will high, fast-reaction contractions on the muscles, i.e. more so w/high speed running, or various martial arts, less so with controlled weight lifting (though post-weight lifting stretching can be very desirable to lower strength or mass-building's tendency to lower flexibility due to higher muscle mass). @Alex Hall: 

He is likely to be more correct for his own body because he is used to it. But low-impact warmups like fast walking, biking or even passive heating in a sauna or hot-tub would likely provide benefits -- with more benefits showing when you are cold (say coming indoors in winter), or morning training, when your body temperature is naturally, usually, at a daily low. Despite my tendency to like stretching (as a centerpiece of a workout), I believe the statistics favor consistent warm-up and stretch activities before heavy exercise, more than doing good warming up and stretches on some or most days, but leaving it out on days when you are short on time. It will be just those days when you are in a hurry and skip normal pre-workout "rituals", that you are likely to subject muscles and joints to abnormal strain and possible injury. One can easily see how mental attitude affects their body: straying attention and thinking about whatever is causing the "rushed-feeling" vs. focusing on good form and on how much intensity you are "throwing" at your body (that is, otherwise, accommodated to warm-ups and stretching). Of course, if your workout-coach can't adapt to a workout style you can live and thrive with, they may not be the best coach for your specific body. A*a 

I know the key behind weight lifting and strength training is giving your body time to rest, recover, and build muscle. So you can't go back to gym or even biking the day after. What about the day before? Can I do heavy aerobic exercise on Monday and lift weights on Tuesday? 

Some books recommend a gentle bounce when bench pressing or squatting. This feels wrong to me. It feels safer and more controlled to come to a complete stop, then start up again. What should I do? 

I'm following Starting Strength, but don't want to give up my aerobic program. I'm especially confused about the nature of recovery: I know you need to recover, yet, at the same time, SS says "don't worry about training while sore". If my muscles are tired from the weights when I swim or walk, is that good, bad, or neither? 

I find it hard to load and unload plates when the bar is on the ground for deadlift. When the bar is on the rack, it's easy to put the 45 lbs on and off. But, when the bar is on the ground, it's very hard to hold the bar up with one hand, hold the 45 lbs plate in the other, and bend down and around and put the plate on. Bending to the bottom seems to ruin all my leverage and ability to use my back muscles to hold the plates. (The bars in my gym are nicked enough that the plates don't just slide - you have to work them on.) When I'm done, getting them off is even harder, esp. as I'm already exhausted. Today I dropped the bar on my foot trying to do this! What's the best way to get the plates on and off a bar on the ground for deadlifting? 

My Experience I used to eat 1-2k worth of processed sugar almost every day. I would think about sugar when I wasn't eating it. It was almost an addiction. I switched to Atkins and started training on a bike, I have lost 9 kg in six weeks, and probably would have lost more if I hadn't been gaining muscle mass. I eat 1.8-2.5k calories a day. Some Points: 

I put this much detail into this post because I am concerned about your weight, and dietary preferences beyond just the sugar from soda. 

P.s., to those with stereotypical unscientific negative notions on carbless diets I refer here, and here. 

I’m at 25% body fat and weight 87.5 KG. I use the cross trainer for 2-1 splits. My heart rate is 194-196 at resistance 10 recovering down to 186 at resistance 3. I can keep this routine up for 60-90 minutes 5-6 times a week. I feel I am quite adapted to this routine, I have built it up gradually. I breathe normally throughout and I feel generally fine afterwards — it’s getting better over time. I sweat profusely though and my heart rate concerns me — it has always been high during exercise. I’d like it to be normal but at a stride of 150 and resistance 2-4 my heart rate will stay in the 170-180 range so lower intensity isn’t the key -- especially since my lungs and muscles are adapting as normal. I’d need to stick to walking to be in the MAF formula 180-35 (+15) range. Since I sweat like mad I assume my body fat percentage is making it hard for my body to loose heat and I’d need a higher heart rate to cool my body down. Should I expect to have a more normal exercising heart rate once I get down to the 10-15% body fat range ? 

I did my first "real" deadlift today, and, it's a very different feeling. Unlike a squat or a bench, where I clearly feel myself pushing against something, when I deadlifted (135 lbs, about what I'm squatting), I just kind of stood up. When I was done, I was sweating and exhausted, but I didn't feel the push-higher-higher I do when doing other lifts. Am I doing it right? What is a deadlift supposed to feel like? 

I'm doing barbell squats as described in Starting Strength. When I get to a certain depth, I feel my thigh bone (femur?) pinching up against the inside of my pelvis, and feel like I can't go any deeper. Is my form wrong? Do I stop there? Or do I somehow go deeper? Note that I didn't feel these before, and was going very deep. But observers told me (correctly I believe) that my knees would go forward too much, or that my hips were going up and down, not back and out. Fixing that (now my squat looks like right) has caused this pinch. 

What's the right to squat: Focus on driving up and down, or on sticking one's backside out? From what guys at the gym say, and many pictures online, you need to be sticking yourself out. Yet from Starting Strength's instructions: focusing on tightening lower back, chest up, hip drive - it seems to be more of an up down motion, without as much protrusion. Which is correct? Does the backside need to protrude? 

Lego's answer is quite comprehensive, but to me it sounds way too painful, unnecessary and unnatural. Unnatural because your metabolism will still be dealing with carbs, doesn't matter how complex or what glycemic index they have. Just like a lot of calorie-restriction low-fat diets are unnatural. As long as high levels of carbs are there, the instinct will remain, and you will have to deal with withdrawal for ages, It's torturous. Lego's solution implies Personality-conditioning, Personality-conditioning in the face of your body generating withdrawal and longing. You can just condition your body, a very painless process. Low-carb diets are the answer to your problems, Your metabolic processes change and your body's hunger mechanism is completely changed, one change is insulin and blood sugar is no longer in the loop, so your body literally forgets about sugar. You don't have to stick to the diet forever, 2 weeks would be enough to break the addiction I reckon. but you are a heavy dude like me), and are probably heading to type-2 diabetes, heart disease, and high blood pressure :(, so it be worth sticking to it for longer. There will most likely be a gap in your life if you eliminate those things which you took great pleasure from. I recommend endurance exercise to fill this gap :D The Atkins program is quite good a good way to start. Here is What you do : Stop eating carbs and sugar, 60% fat + 35% protein and 5% complex veggie carbs. No bread, no pasta, no fruit. Your addiction will literally fall through the floor 6 or so days in. You'll have 2 days or so of fogginess, after that your set. Add more salt to your food because you excrete more salt when you eat like this, if you don't you might start feeling faint, eat more salt especially during exercise.
