"Aggregate" in "Five Aggregates" is a common translation of the Sanskrit word "skandha" or Pali "khandha". Other translations of include "heap", "group", "collection". The image for this is a heap of firewood. In the metaphor of fire (SN 35.28), in which dukkha is compared with burning, and liberation (nirvana) is compared with extinguishing, the heaps of firewood are the stuff that burns. That's why they are called "puncca upadana skandha" (lit. "five heaps of fuel"). It is important to understand that when Buddha speaks about existence in the ultimate sense, he almost always speaks from phenomenological perspective. This means Buddha speaks about direct subjective experience, because direct subjective experience is all we have direct access to, everything else we know about the world is always mediated by direct subjective experience. (Strictly speaking, we don't even know if the world we experience actually exists. We could all be connected in some sort of Matrix, or sleeping in some Inception-like dream. But our experience is real when taken "as is".) So when Buddha talks about "dharmas", he means the smallest possible elements of subjective experience: sort of the atoms the experience is made of. In pure subjective experience, dharma does not have a carrier, there is no such thing as "dharmin". All we can say is that there is a quality (lakshana) that we can experience, and that momentary atom of experience that has some sort of quality is a dharma. When Buddha used vipashyana to analyse his direct subjective experience, he classified the entire "stream" of dharmas into groups. Entire world, everything we normally experience "outside" of ourselves, fell into "rupa-skandha", or the dharmas associated with the world of forms. The four other skandhas represent the so-called "internal" experiences. So when you "look" inside, when you do introspection or self-reflection, everything you "see" will fall into one of the four skandhas. In general, in all cases everything you see "inside", and everything you see "outside", is a dharma, by definition. These dharmas are classified into five groups or heaps of firewood. No dharma exists outside of this classification of five skandhas. So to answer your question, skandhas are made from dharmas - the "atoms" of subjective experience. It is a big mistake to think that the first Skandha only refers to one's body, and the rest refer to mind. It is an equally severe mistake to assume that it refers to physical objects. So we can't say 'these dharmas are made from water, fire and so on', because that would be speaking from a regular materialistic perspective. Here we are talking phenomenologically! Instead, dharmas are samskaras (assemblies) of causes and conditions. For each dharma (experience) there is a number of causes and conditions responsible for why we are currently experiencing it. These causes and conditions are themselves dharmas, of all five types. In the fire metaphor, the causes and conditions are the pieces of wood supporting the upper pieces and so on. The whole thing is like one giant burning campfire, that we analytically separate into the five heaps. 

Lethargy (styana) -- heaviness of mind and body, a state of being close to sleep; Coarse laxity (audarika) -- a case of having stability of mind but not clarity of the mind; This is often caused by the mind becoming too withdrawn inside; Subtle laxity (suksma) -- a case of having stability and clarity but not intensity of clarity. This is caused by the weakness in the mode of apprehension of the aspects of the object of observation. 

The words in SN 38.14 are not even attributed to Buddha, they are Sariputra's. I don't know why Theravada took them as the basis of their analysis. Instead, the authoritative definition of dukkha is found in SN 56.11, the first and main sutra of Buddhism, The Sutra of Setting the Wheel of Dharma in Motion: 

From my personal side, I used to be an adherent of the psychological interpretation for many years, until some recent events in my life that screamed of the ontological interpretation. So now I'm a bit uncertain myself and am sticking to the Safe Bet until I can figure it out. Or I guess, I think I know the answer (it's ontological) just not ready to fully accept it yet. In response to your concerns about your mind affecting the universe or the newsspeaker etc. I suggest that you stick to the Safe Bet and try to eliminate this worry and these negative states of mind. If there are no other dimensions, you don't want to develop a psychosis that will turn your life in a nightmare through the mechanism of vicious circle. And if there are other dimensions, you don't want to shift to a bad one by being negative, are you? ;) I hope one day we will figure it out. Until then, let's stick to the Four Right Efforts: 

Pretty much, yes. At least the most noticeable, psychosomatic, aspect of the emotion ("how it feels") is definitely Vedana. However, what we usually call "emotion" in the West is really a complex process that involves all the five skandhas. 

Summarizing briefly from the introduction to the translation and analysis by A.V. Paribok: The ancient parts are Book 2 and parts of Book 1 -- most likely written in Punjab (North-Western India) about 0 CE. The language of the original was probably Hybrid Sanskrit. Book 1 (the narrative introduction) was evidently expanded and elaborated at a later time, probably to make it better fit with Theravada - the late parts include: the story of monks traveling to the heavens, Nagasena's birth, his travel to Pataliputra, Buddha's prediction of Nagasena's birth, the episode of Nagasena teaching Abhidharma expanded with TOC of Theravada's Abhidharma-pitaka. Book 2 is the MP proper, ending with "In Milindapanha the questions and answers are finished". The next part is Book 3 (the largest), written in 1st-2nd century CE, probably still in Hybrid Sanskrit. The way it explains controversial Buddha's quotes by interpreting them either as ultimate teaching or a mere provisional guidance, can be seen as an early element of Mahayana. Books 2 and 3 are evidently the most interesting parts of Milindapanha as far as Buddhist teaching and philosophy. Books 4-6 were written even later, most likely in Ceylon - already in Pali language. Of them book 4 is the earliest, written as a response to the question about existence of Buddha in Book 2 Chapter 5. Book 5 is written to address the unanswered question of Book 1: why go forth as a monk if the Goal can be attained in lay life. Book 6 was written even later, imitating the style of books 4 and 5. The content of the text in its present form has probably stabilized by 500 CE. In Theravada, Milindapanha is considered the middle ground between the Canon and the commentaries - because the commentaries often quote MP. Although it seems clear that MP belongs to the Sthavira family of schools (as opposed to Maha-sangha) - however when analyzed critically, MP does not exactly match the teaching of any single school, clearly mismatching Theravada on many points. For those who'd like to read MP online, the versions I find available are T. W. Rhys David's early translation circa 1890 and Bhikkhu Pesala's highly abridged and simplified version - which he himself calls "free rendering". Unfortunately Horner's translation titled "Milinda's Questions" is only available in hard copy and the cost is prohibitive. Access To Insight has excerpts from Books 2 and 3. There is also an abridged version edited by N. K. G. Mendis which is based on Horner's translations with some borrowings from T.W. Rhys David plus editor's own translation - this is supposed to be pretty good to deserve Bhikkhu Bodhi's endorsement but I'm not entirely convinced the editor was not biased to Theravada school.
