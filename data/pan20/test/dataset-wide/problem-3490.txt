I had a look at the data, and it is like @denesp says in his comment: e.g. a $2.60\%=0.0261$ population growth rate is written as $2.60$, a $24\%=0.24$ investment-to-output ratio is written like $24.0$, etc. So they must be divided by $100$. 

(I suspect that $E_t[x_{t+1}] = E(x_{t+1}\mid I_t)$, where $I_t$ is the Information Set, i.e. $E_t[x_{t+1}]$ is translated as "the expected value of random variable $x_{t+1}$ conditional on Information available at time $t$"). @FooBar answer implemented the "standard solution algorithm", arrived at a constant solution, and remarked that such a solution violates the limiting condition. Strictly speaking, a constant solution would satisfy the limiting solution also, if it was equal to zero (which in our case implies $k=0$): If indeed we had as solution $$x_t = \frac k{1-\beta}$$ then $$\lim_{t \to \infty} x_t = \lim_{t \to \infty}\frac k{1-\beta} = \frac k{1-\beta} \neq 0$$ except if $k=0$. But this is trivial (or at least, uninteresting). So I ask, if $k\neq 0$, what would it take to obtain a solution? The law of evolution must hold also at the limit so $$\lim_{t \to \infty} x_t = \lim_{t \to \infty}\Big[\beta E_t[x_{t+1}] + k\Big]=0$$ $$\Rightarrow \lim_{t \to \infty}E_t[x_{t+1}] = -\frac k{\beta} \tag{1}$$ In words, as the random variable tends to zero, its expected value conditional on information available in the previous period, must equal a non-zero constant, while the variable itself tends to zero. Consider some cases, to see whether and when such a thing can happen: A) If $x_t$ was totally unobservable, (not observed directly, and not amenable to indirect estimation though other variables)? In such a case, the information set would not contain any information on $x_t$, meaning that the conditional expected value would equal the unconditional one. So we would have, $$\lim_{t \to \infty}E_t[x_{t+1}] = \lim_{t \to \infty}E[x_{t+1}] \tag{2}$$ This is economics, meaning that the properties of the mathematical entities should take into account what do they represent in the real world. So it would be meaningless not to assume that $x_{t+1}$ is not bounded (more over, this would mean that the $x$ random variable goes to infinity in finite time and then "comes back" to tend to zero in infinite time -and for those who may think "hyperinflation", hyperinflation is a very very small number compared to infinity). If it is bounded then the Dominated/Bounded Convergence theorem holds and we have that $$\lim_{t \to \infty}E\left(x_{t+1}\right) =E\left(\lim_{t \to \infty}x_{t+1}\right) =0 \neq -\frac k{\beta} \tag{3}$$ So this is not a case in which we can obtain the required relation $(1)$. B) The limiting condition is part of the information sets for finite $t$. Then immediately $$E\left(\lim_{t \to \infty}x_{t+1}\mid I_t\right) =0$$ In words, at any point in time we know that the variable will tend eventually to zero. Can this be compatible with relation $(1)$? We could invoke again the boundedness of $x_t$, and a generalization of the Dominated Convergence Theorem, since here the (conditional probability) measure is also time-varying, and again obtain a zero expectation at the limit. But intuitively also, if we know that eventually the variable will tend to zero, at some point in time this must be reflected in $E_t$, most certainly at the limit. But then again, the required relation $(1)$ won't hold. C) We do observe perfectly or imperfectly the value of the variable, but "we don't give proper notice": our Expectations are not Rational. In that case, the symbol $E_t$ no longer represents the conditional expectations operator, but it is just a generic symbol for the "anticipation at time $t$" (in Adaptive Learning literature this is usually symbolized by $E^*_t$) and it acquires the value it needs to acquire for the limiting condition to hold. In other words, given the law of evolution and the limiting condition, we conclude that expectations must not obey the Rational Expectations Hypothesis, not even at the limit. In such a case, a solution is obvious: define $$E^*_t(x_{t+1}) = -\frac {(1-c\beta^t)k}{\beta}$$ for some constant $c$, This expectations formation rule satisfies $(1)$, and transforms the law of motion into $$x_t = \beta \Big[-\frac {(1-c\beta^t)k}{\beta}\Big] + k = ck\beta^t$$ which in turn satisfies the limiting condition. So we conclude that: the specific equation, with the specific limiting condition, has a solution if expectations formation does not obey the Rational Expectations Hypothesis, but instead follows the above rule, or some other to the same limiting effect. 

Under the assumption of i.i.d. Normal characteristics, the situation described is taken care by separate Welch's t-tests that account for possibly different sample sizes and different variances. Denote the statistics of these tests $t_j, j=1,...,K$. The p-value associated with each is $$p_j = \Pr\big(|t_j|\geq t(\alpha)\mid H_0\big) $$ where $H_0$ is the hypothesis that the populations means between treated and controlled group are equal, and $t$ depends on the significance level $1-\alpha$. We can write the probability in terms of the corresponding cumulative distribution function, $$\Pr\big(|t_j|\geq t(\alpha)\mid H_0\big) = 1 - F(|t_j|)$$ Therefore $$p_j = 1 - F(|t_j|) \implies 1-p_j = F(|t_j|)$$ If we contemplate the situation a priori, before even looking at the data, then the p-values lie in the future and can be modelled as random variables. Viewed as a random variable, the probability integral transform tells us that $1-p_j$ follows a $U(0,1)$ Uniform distribution, and by the properties of this distribution so does $p_j$. Collecting all $p_j$, we have a sample of size $K$ of independent $U(0,1)$ uniforms. The probability that at least one of them is smaller that a specific value, say $p^*$, is equal to the probability that the minimum of them is lower than this threshold. This can be understood as follows: $$\Pr\Big (\text {At least one $p_j \leq p^*$} \Big) = \Pr\Big (\text {Not all $p_j > p^*$} \Big) $$ $$ = 1-\Pr\Big (\text {All $p_j > p^*$} \Big) = 1- \prod_{j=1}^K \Pr\Big ( p_j > p^* \Big)$$ due to independence, and so, since they are identically distributed, $$\Pr\Big (\text {At least one $p_j \leq p^*$} \Big) = 1- \left [1-\Pr\Big ( p \leq p^* \Big)\right]^K = 1 - \left [1-F_U \big(p^* \big)\right]^K$$ But this is the cumulative distribution function of the minimum of $K$ i.i.d random variables. Denote this minimum $p_{(1)}$. The CDF of the minimum of $K$ independent $U(0,1)$ variables is $$F_{p_{(1)}}(p_{(1)}) = 1 - \big [1-p_{(1)}\big]^K$$ We want the probability $$ \Pr(p_{(1)} \leq p^*) = 1- \big [1-p^*\big]^K$$ Indicative values: 

And $(1-\alpha)/\alpha$ is an odds (not "odds ratio"). So here you are: a vNM utility function is associated with the odds that can characterize a person's preferences. ADDENDUM After an interesting but too lengthy exchange of opinions and thoughts in the comments with the OP, I decided to enhance this answer with an example, in order to show that in the context of the specific theory of preferences we are discussing, "preference intensity" (as is informally discussed here) cannot be dissociated from "attitude towards risk" -they are inextricably linked. Assume that an individual declares (as he has every right to): "My preferences are monotonic and I prefer more to less. Moreover, the next five euros will give me exactly the same utility as the five after them". Note that this is the individual speaking -we cannot question him by whether utility can be cardinal or not etc. Starting from zero for convenience, we symbolize his statement as $$u(10) - u(5) = u(5) - u(0) \implies u(5) = \frac 12 u(0) + \frac 12 u(10) \tag {1}$$ In the context of the discussion with the OP, this is a statement about "preference intensity". Next we present to this individual the following choice: he can either get $5$ euros, or he can participate to a gamble $G$ where he will get $0$ euros with probability $1/2$ or $10$ euros with probability $1/2$. The individual then declares that he strictly prefers to get the $5$ euros with certainty. This is a statement revealing "attitude towards risk". Question: Can the preferences of this individual, as described by his two statements, be represented by a utility function that possesses the Expected Utility Property? Answer: No. Proof: By his second statement, the individual revealed that the Certainty Equivalent of the gamble $CE_G$ is strictly less than $5$ euros: Therefore we have that $$E[u(G)] = u(CE_G) < u(5) \tag{2}$$ Now for the Expected Utility property to hold, it must be the case that $$u[G;p(G)] = E[u(G)] = \frac 12 u(0) + \frac 12 u(10) \tag{3}$$ Due to $(2)$ (which expresses the "attitude towards risk" of the individual) we have that $$(2), (3) \implies \frac 12 u(0) + \frac 12 u(10) < u(5) \tag {4}$$ But this contradicts $(1)$, which expresses "preference intensity" of the individual. So we conclude that an individual whose preferences are described by the above statements cannot be represented by a utility function that possesses the Expected Utility Property. In other words, for the Expected Utility property to hold, "attitude towards risk" cannot be dissociated from "preference intensity". If the individual had declared that he was indifferent between the $5$ certain euros and the gamble $G$, then his preferences could be represented by a utility function that had the EU property. But in order to achieve that, we had to "align" the "attitude towards risk" with "preference intensity".
