In the publication 'Oxalic acid does not influence nonhaem iron absorption in humans: a comparison of kale and spinach meals' (Bonsmann, Walczyk, Renggli, Hurrell), the bioavailability of iron from spinach was found to be about 8% and that the precence of oxalic acid does not have significant impact on the availability. And then we also have 'Oxalate content of food and its effect on humans' (Noonan, Savage), in which the discussion is mainly about the impact on calcium absorbtion, but where they also conclude with a certain insecurity when it comes to iron: 

To answer your question first: Yes, the study shows that divorce and breakup rates are significantly higher for couples where the housework is equally shared or where the man does most of the work. Oddthinking already linked to the report in Norwegian, the relevant chapter 9 is on the pages 201-214. You can of course run the text through e.g. Google Translate and get a reasonable translation if you are interested in the details. At the end of the study, there is also a short English summary. I'll try to give a few more details here. In the introduction, the report refers to a report "Cooke, L. P. (2006). "Doing" gender in context: Household bargaining and risk of divorce in Germany and the United States. American Journal of Sociology 112(2): 442–472.", in which similar correlations have been examined in Germany and the US. They find the same correlation in Germany, whereas in the US, there is an opposite correlation (work sharing couples are more stable). The Norwegian report is based on a 2007/2008 survey, where couples (married and living together) were asked how they share the housework (female does most of the work, equally shared or the husband does most of the work), if they are satisfied with their marriage (or more exactly: "Have you thought about a breakup within the last year?") and actual statistic data throughout 2011 of their divorces and breakups. The correlation between housework sharing and relationship satisfaction is shown in chart 9.1 on page 204. The vertical scale is the percentage of the respondents, which have thought about a breakup within the last year. The horizontal scale is from left to right "the woman does clearly most", "the woman does some more", "the work is equally shared" and "the man does most". Women are represented with the square dots, men with the diamond dots. It shows that: 

The incident was extensively covered in regular Swedish media. It seems undisputed that a Syrian 14 year old boy committed the crime, but there are conflicting reports about the background events leading up to the murder. The offender did not face criminal charges, since he was below the Swedish age of criminal responsibility (straffbarhetsåldern), which is set at 15. He was however sentenced to forced psychiatric care . 

The statistics for the IDF missions are only favorable if you agree with IDF's definition of a combatant. In case of "Operation Cast Lead", IDF operates with 1166 casualties, of which at least 709 were combatants (appr. 0.5 civilian per combatant). The numbers from the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights are very different: They count 1417 casualties, of which 236 were combatants (appr. 5 civilians per combatant). 

First of all, it is true that aspartame decomposes to aspartic acid (~50%), phenylalanine (~40%) and methanol (~10%) when exposed to heat or in very acidic or alkaline environments and that methanol and formaldehyde are (can be) toxic. Comparing formaldehyde with asbestos and plutonium is very misleading. Smaller amounts of formaldehyde is both produced and required by the human body itself and ingested formaldehyde is rapidly metabolized. Asbestos and plutonium is accumulated in the body and can reach toxic levels after prolonged exposure. A can of diet soda contains up to a few 100 mg of aspartame, e.g. a 355 ml can of Diet Coke contains 131 mg. If all the aspartame is decomposed, you will be exposed to about 13 mg (10%) of methanol by drinking such a can of Diet Coke. Most kinds of fruits and vegetables have a natural methanol content as well. Since pectin easily decomposes to methanol, eating fruit with high pectin levels exposes you to much higher amounts of methanol than drinking diet soda. Eating one kg of apples, will for example release up to 500mg of methanol in the digestive tract. I agree that one kg of apples is unusually much to eat at once, but comparing it with the 40 cans of Diet Coke required to ingest the same amount of methanol, there are obviously other things to worry more about than aspartame. Is aspartame dangerous? I honestly can't answer that, but the amount of methanol you can be exposed to by eating or drinking "normal" amounts of food or beverages sweetened with aspartame is most likely not. 

I don't know any specific research regarding "Comic Sans" and dyslexics, but there are at least a few fonts designed by and for dyslexics to ease reading. Two examples are the free OpenDyslexic font by Abelardo Gonzalez or the commercial Dyslexie font by Christian Boer. Christian Boer is a dyslexic, Dutch graphics designer, who has used his own experiences as a dyslexic and feedback from dyslexic friends to create a font, which tries to avoid typical problems. On his web page, he has summarized many of his design decisions and at least a few of these design principles can be found in "Comic Sans" as well, e.g: 

Another perhaps more disturbing issue is the margin of error due to the unusually small sample size for the poll. Even if the total number of respondents was 1057 (roundabout 1000 respondents is a common sample size for polls), the sampling error increases significantly when splitting the group into smaller subsets. There are several statistical approaches to estimate the error margin for a poll result, but using a rather common formula M=2*sqrt(P*(1-P)/N) with P being the fraction of respondents (41%) and N being the number of respondents (180) gives a margin of error (M) of about ± 7 percentage points, meaning that the real value probably lies somewhere in the range 34-48%. With even smaller sample sizes, the numbers for the other candidates' supporters have an even larger estimated margin of error. In addition to these two issues, it is also not a big secret that it is easily possible for polling firms to influence the response by e.g. carefully choosing the wording of the question or answer alternatives or by modifying the context of the question. In this particular case, the Agrabah question follows several other legit questions regarding Moslems, Arabs or Islam and even if I am now just speculating again; it is of course not impossible that PPP here on purpose tries to trick the respondents into some kind of 'anti Moslem/Arab/Islam state' to lure them towards a supporting answer. On the other hand, even if PPP tries to influence the answer, one could of course ask why Trump's supporters are statistically significant more easily tricked to support the bombing of Agrabah (41% ±7pp) than the other Republican voters (23% ±4pp) or the Democrat voters (19% ±3pp). To summarize: The 41% count is the result of a relatively silly poll question. There are several flaws in the poll, but even considering the expected margins of error due to the small sample sizes, the results of the poll shows that Trump's supporters are significantly more eager to bomb Agrabah than both other Republican or the Democrat voters. The difference between the other Republicans and the Democrats is so small, that it falls within the estimated margin of error. 

Looking at the crime and unemployment ratios separately, there is a very large variance in the numbers. Here is a list of countries, where at least one of the ratios are >10: 

All countries show an unemployment ratio >1. The crime ratios may also contradict the early assumption that the law enforcement may more strictly pursuit crimes committed by specific ethnic groups. The crime rates for immigrants from Sweden and UK are e.g. higher than for the immigrants from Poland, Turkey, Ukraine, Bosnia, Eritrea, Ethiopia and Pakistan - immigrant groups which undoubtedly have a reputation of being "more criminal" than other foreigners. If I now try to correlate these ratios (crime ratio divided by unemployment ratio, Norway still being fixed to 1), we get a number where a high value indicate a high criminal ratio despite low unemployment, while a low number indicate a low criminal ratio, despite high unemployment. Immigrants from only six countries score a crime per unemployment ratio >1.5: 

It is difficult to find the required numbers to answer your question as asked, but I've made an attempt. The raw data I've used is from the statistical database from "Statistics Norway". The charts and numbers are not deep-linkable but available in the sections "Immigration and immigrants", "Population", "Labour market and earnings" and "Social conditions, welfare and crime". "Statistics Norway" offer a lot of raw data from their database, but not all numbers are broken down by citizenship. I've tried to find a few datasources, from which at least a partial conclution can be drawn (all numbers from 2010): 

6 of the 44 countries have rather extreme ratios and fall outside this diagram, but plotting the crime ratio on the X axis and the unemployment ratio on the Y axis gives the following plot: 

I don't have any sound right now, so I am a little but unsure about the amount he claimed to be able to drink. You quote it as 'a quart' (946ml), the subtitles translate it with 'a large glass' and your calculations of the amount of pure glyphosate do not match up. In any case, since we are roughly within the same amounts that are mentioned in the study: Drinking a glass of glyphosate may give you anything from a sore throat to a lethal reaction. 

There are conflicting studies on this subject. First of all, dietary iron is usually categorized into one of the two forms 'heme iron' and 'non-heme iron'. Heme iron is technically a ferrous ion bound to an organic molecule, chemically similar or identical to the form iron is usually bound in the human body. This form of iron is only available in products of animal origin, especially red meat. Non-heme iron are much simpler inorganic ferrous or ferric compounds, which are present both in vegetables and in animal products. Even if the actual numbers differ between different publications, it is commonly accepted that the bioavailability (the ratio actually available for digestion) of heme iron is significantly higher than for non-heme iron. In 'The relative dietary importance of haem and non-haem iron' (Bezwoda, Bothwell, Charlton et al.) the bioavailability of heme iron was measured to be about 20%, while the availability of non-heme iron varied between 6% and 18% depending on the amount of iron present in the meal. The relative availability dropped distinctly when the amount of iron increased, meaning that the absolute amount of iron actually absorbed stayed nearly the same, even if the meal itself contained much more iron. These findings seem to indicate that, at least for the purpose of obtaining iron, it might not be particularly beneficial to eat iron-rich vegetables at all (not just limited to spinach), since the absolute amount of bioavailable non-heme iron is limited. Another issue particularly valid for spinach is the high content of oxalic acid. It is known that oxalic acid reacts with many minerals, lowering or even inhibiting the bioavailability of the minerals. Oxalic acid reacts particularly easy with calcium to form calcium oxalate, which not only makes the calcium completely unusable for the human body, but is also concidered a poisonous substance and a major contributor to the formation of kidney stones (a kidney stone is basically a large crystal of calcium oxalate). It is however disputed if oxalic acid has a relevant impact on the bioavailability of iron, although it can react with iron to form ferrous oxalate or ferric oxalate. If we now look into some of the publications on this subject, you can actually find almost the complete range of interpretations. An often quoted article from 'Scientific American' - 'Iron Deficiency' (Neil S. Scrimshaw): 

I've made all the data used in these calculations available in an unfortunately rather chaotic OO Calc Spreadsheet. Source of the data: Statistisk Sentralbyrå, Statistics Norway. Feel free to draw your own conclusions. 

The source is a poll conducted by 'Public Policy Polling': Trump Lead Grows Nationally; 41% of His Voters Want to Bomb Country From Aladdin; Clinton Maintains Big Lead The poll was conducted on Dec 16th and 17th 2015, partially by phone, partially over the internet. There was a total of 1057 respondents, of which 532 usually vote for the Republicans, of which 34% (about 180) answered the following question with 'Donald Trump': 

I am not sure if the Dutch preferred orange carrots, but carrots in different colours, including orange, were obviously common much longer ago than the 16th or 17th century. This drawing from the "Vienna Dioscurides" dates back to appr. 515 CE and shows an orange carrot (source. Wikipedia): 

It is at least asserted that air humidity affects health relevant environmental factors, but if you are interested in marketing for a humidifier or dehumidifier, you can freely pick arguments both in favour of dry and humid indoor environments: Recent research shows that the absolute air humidity has a strong impact on the survival rate of air-born flue virus. Cold air (which is dry in absolute terms, although relatively humid) or dry air increase the flue virus' life span. Increasing the air humidity will reduce the risk of a flue infection. Dry air on the other side, will however prevent other factors with negative health impact. Most fungi spores will only thrive under high humidity, so keeping a dry climate will avoid mold growth. These are of course only two examples allowing opposite argumentation for a dry or humid climate. There are endless other examples of germs or e.g. pest carrying insects, which presence or amount can be controlled by manipulating air humidity. Another issue is the vaporization of toxic solvents from building materials, which increases in dry air, but the "real" solution to that problem is probably to avoid such building materials completely instead of minimizing the risk by increasing air humidity. 

There are two relevant differences between the "Top Conservative News" summary and the actual report from Swedish Radio, to which they are linking: 

As ChrisW already pointed out, both the disposition from the "Committee on the Constitution" (including some background information and reasoning behind the law changes) and the changes and amendments themselves can be found here in Swedish. Since the changes and amendments are embedded as images instead of printable text, it is not possible to run these through a translator. The changes are in fact not very substantial. Most modifications are just a modernization of the language, there are some clarifications to existing regulations and then perhaps two modifications, which have obviously been picked up by the right wing press and liberally interpreted. Without making any changes to what is actually forbidden, the amendments of the law opens up for the public prosecutor under more liberal limitations than before, to press charges without involvement of the insulted person or persons and it opens up for a possibility for allegedly insulted persons to try their case in court without the risk of having to pay the opponent's costs. I am not a lawyer and it is difficult to provide a proper translation of the legalese text of the law, but I'll try to explain the modifications here: Modifications to the law on freedom of press Chapter 1, § 6: Clarification, that a printed matter is not considered to be for publication in Sweden, just because it is sent from Sweden to intended recipients abroad. Chapter 1, § 9: Amendment that recipients of credit and solvency status reports must have a justified requirement for such information. Chapter 10 and 13: Only modernization of the language. Modifications to the law on freedom of speech Chapter 1, § 10: Clarification, that a technical recording is not considered to be published or broadcast in Sweden, just because it is sent from Sweden to intended recipients abroad. Chapter 10, § 2: Without context, it is not obviously clear what the modifications refers to, but it is yet another clarification regarding statements made outside Sweden but intended for recipients within Sweden and vice versa. Modifications to the penal code Chapter 5, § 5: In this paragraph, it is regulated in which cases the public prosecutor is allowed to initiate criminal proceedings without any charge or report from the recipient(s) of the alleged insults. The modification is that the "special circumstances" required in the old law text are removed. Old text: "... the public prosecutor is allowed to initiate criminal proceedings under special circumstances, if this seem required from a public point of view ..." New text: "... the public prosecutor is allowed to initiate criminal proceedings, if this seem required from a public point of view ..." Modifications to regulations concerning freedom of press and freedom of speech Chapter 10, § 4: The amendment opens up for the court to decide that the losing party must only cover their own costs if it is in the public interest to prove the case in a court. 

Since fatigue is one of the most common symptoms of hypothyroidism, a hypothyroidism diagnosis basically rules out a CFS diagnosis. 

The claim is at least possible, although there is a great uncertainty both in the estimate of number of grains of sand on the world's beaches and the world-wide number of bytes stored. What is immediately obvious is that the text in the news article you're linking to seem to indicate a correlation between the daily number of bytes created and the number of bytes actually stored. I won't even guess a ratio, but I would assume that the larger part of the "created bytes" are for immediate use and not actually permanently stored anywhere. The answer ratcher freak mentioned in his comment is already linking to estimates of the number of sand grains on earth. The sources for the numbers (ranging from 7.5*10^18 for the world's beaches to 10^20-10^24 for the total number of sand grains) are obviously just rough estimates. I am not able to find any more reliable numbers and I doubt that any exists. The "International Data Corporation" regularly publishes reports on the estimated global data storage and predicted development. Their most recent reports "The Digital Universe in 2020" estimates the global number of bytes stored in 2012 to be 2.9x10^21 and estimated to increase to 4x10^22 in 2020. These numbers are of course not exact values either, but the report has at least some details on how the numbers are produced. Since the article only states the expected ratio between number of grains of sand and number of stored bytes (57) and not an absolute number for any of the compared values, it is of course difficult to tell if they have done their math correctly. The estimates for the number of grains of sand vary by a factor larger than 100.000 and the estimates for the number of stored bytes (both for 2012 and 2020) are placed somewhere in between.
