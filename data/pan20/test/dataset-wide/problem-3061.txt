There have been chats related to a post-work society at least since the industrial revolution. Paul Lafarge, for instance, wrote an essay called the Right to be Lazy (1880, published 1883): 

(The article on microscopes has a similar claim with a few other potentially useful references.) Cursory googling for medieval lens examples yields this page, among others. It has a pictures of a crystal lens that pre-dates eyeglasses. In fact, the latter article yields reading stones, which might very well be what you're looking for: 

Wine has no vitamin C at all, so the answer would be: definitely no. But there's a twist. To expand on @LarsBosteen's comment: the wiki page on Posca and romae-vitam.com claim that Posca, rather than wine, actually may have been the antiscorbutic the larger population relied on. It's basically a mix of wine vinegar, water, and additives thrown in for flavor (Romans, as an aside, thought of drinking wine pure as vulgar). That is a lot more plausible - especially given the recipe suggestion on romae-vitam.com: 

Here's another such street in Eger (Hungary), whose center is occasionally called "the Baroque Pearl of Europe": 

Googling for brings up Goods, Power, History: Latin America's Material Culture by Arnold J. Bauer. At page 25 it hints that we don't know for sure: 

The Kingdom of Egypt in Cleopatra's time was not like Ancient Egypt. It was then the Kingdom of Ptolemy - one of a various Hellenistic kingdoms created when when Alexander the Great died. It had a blend of Greek and ancient Egyptian cultures. The dominant elites were Greek.

It matters very little if there was anecdotal evidence prior to 1900BC. What matters is that, per your own question, the archeological evidence found to date suggests that cremation went from anecdotal or non-existent to widespread after that, while burials went from widespread to rare. This suggests that something occurred around then that was significant enough to change local habits. One contender (the main one?) to explain the shift is that newcomers, the Aryan, introduced new funeral practices that eclipsed existing ones. 

I was reading SPQR by Mary Beard and in the book (pg 200) she mentions the a Roman colony in Spain called Carteia, which was populated by legion veterans. They married local women and had children who were not Roman citizens (because there were no right of marriage for a Roman and non-Roman.) Their children petitioned the Senate for clarification of their (and their cities) legal status. The Senators decided to grant the colony status as 

I was just reading The Tartar Khan's Englishman by Gabriel Ronay and in it he states how King Bela had lost his seal in the fleeing of a battle and this seal was used by the Mongols (through the Englishman who spoke Hungarian) to issue edicts ordering the militia not to muster and for peasants to return from hiding to the fields (where they could later be easier found and killed) 

I have heard of different colonies, each with differing rights, some had Latin rights, some had full Roman rights just like a citizen in Rome, some had full legal rights except for the right to vote, while some had extremely limited rights. And from the above quote it seems that the Senate would choose the type of colony depending on the rights they wanted to give the citizens, as obviously a colony of legion veteran's children was hardly a colony a ex-slaves. I am very curious what where the different types of colonies and what were the rights that went with them. And just for clarification we are talking in the time period before the edict of Caracalla. 

Any chance of surprise would totally be lost as the German's had spies in Spain and Gibraltar who would have noticed the thousands of ships sailing through the straits. Deception was a major component of the Normandy landings, and there would have been no chance for deception sending the ships from Britain to S. France. Also the Allies would not have been able to put as many troops on the ground. The main bases in Britain held the million troops that were on the beach in Normandy by the end of July. Take Sicily as a counter example, we were only able to get around 150,000 troops there in the same time. This was approximately the same amount of troops that later landed in S. France. This was the operational limit in that theature. There was just not the infrastructure required to increase this limit. The supplies, the bases, and most importantly the ships weren't in the Mediterranean and any movement of that amount of material to the staging zones would have most definitely been noticed by German spies. Also consider air power, it was much easier for the Allies to cover landings right next to our bases in the UK. It would have been much more difficult if the landings were in S. France. also as jamesqf pointed out, the exact reasons the defenses were light were because they were being pulled up to N. France to deal with Overlord. Specifically the 2nd SS Das Reich and the 1st SS Leibstandarte Adolf Hitler were pulled from S. France to Normandy. sources: troop numbers from Wikipedia (so take from it what you will) sources for troop movements: $URL$ 

Your question seems to answer itself. As in yes, per your first source they have interbred to the tune of the UK having 1M or so people with Roman ancestors. Romans intermixed of course - they did so everywhere they settled, just like people do nowadays when they change countries. Populations mix, then like now. Per your second source, only 1M Britons out of 65M or so have Roman ancestors. That's quite low: it's a few percent of the population. But how low is that really? Even if you ignore a generous percentage of the total population owing to them not being nationals, descending from recent waves of UK immigrants, descending from earlier settlers or invaders like Saxons, Scots, Picts, Vikings, French, and I'm sure I'm missing many others, not to mention internal migrations from places that didn't intermix with Romans like Scotland, Ireland, and islands up north, and other reasons one might come up with, it'll still be a fraction of the population. But then flip the problem around and it actually looks quite high, actually. Romans didn't migrate wholesale to Anglia. Consider how awful the place is for a Roman. It's cold and wet by any reasonable Mediterranean standard, and it barely - if at all - grows olive trees or wine grapes. Romans that went there were administrative and military staff first and foremost, and the population of London estimates when Romans were around would suggest they weren't that many to boot. Yet they interbred to the tune of having a whopping 1M descendants. Not bad. 

I would add as an aside that the wedding ring finger isn't universal either. Where in Western Europe it usually is the left finger insofar as I'm aware, it is the right finger in Hungary and, I believe, Russia and Greece. Either way there certainly were conventions. I couldn't locate the specific convention(s) the Romans were using, but sempaiscuba's suggestion (left hand ring finger) seems sane in light of the above. (It's almost tempting to speculate that the sex/status rule might have been introduced by the French at some point between Charlemagne and William the conquerer, with the marital status symbolism following at a later point.) 

There are several instances of this mentioned in history books but as to their veracity one can never be certain. First of course was the 3 vs 3 battle of the Horatia and Curiatia brothers for Rome and Alba Longa (even though this wasnt single combat I think it meets the jest of what the OP wants and this is the most probable story of the lot) The second case was between Titus Manlius (yeah I know best name ever right!) who fought a Gaul leader on a bridge in single combat, after he won the Gauls retreated. Tacitus mentions that Germans would have their "hero" fight a captive of the army they were about to face, if their hero won then the battle would commence, if otherwise they would decline battle or seriously rethink their strategy. No names mentioned though. sources: Oakley, S. P. “Single Combat in the Roman Republic” The Classical Quarterly, New Series 35.2 (1985): 392-410. & Solodow, Joseph B. “Livy and the Story of Horatius, 1.24-26” Transactions of the American Philological Association 109 (1979-): 251-268. The historian Gregory of Tours mentions that the Germanic tribes in Spain (Vandals mainly) would often settle disputes between kingdoms with single combat between heros, again though he does not cite any specific examples. There is a legend that Canute and Edmund Ironsides battled in single combat to a draw and upon the draw they decided to rule their kingdoms together, though I think this one is highly unlikely. source: Ashdown, M. “The Single Combat in Certain Cycles of English and Scandinavian Tradition and Romance” The Modern Language Review 117.2 (Apr., 1922): 113-130. In more recent times there is a story about single combat between indian chiefs, in fact the city in Wyoming called Crowheart is named after one. The story told is, to quote wikipedia ... link 

It wasn't simple to track time at night until the invention of mechanical clocks. Before that the breakpoint between days was sunrise (early Roman), solar midnight (later Roman), or sunset (Athenians, Jews) depending on the area and period. Also worth noting is that until mechanical clocks the length of hours would also vary from a day to the next, and time at night wasn't always counted the same way as during the day. The Roman time table that follows, for instance, highlights how days were split in 12 like today, while nights were split in 4 segments in practice - the latter corresponding to guard shifts. 

Siberia was colonized earlier than the 18/19th centuries. There actually were a few challenges by great powers to Russia's colonial empire as it expanded and later: from China to some extent early on, if one is willing to count the latter as a great power in the 16-18th centuries, and later from Great Britain and Japan in the 19th century. Russia conquered Siberia during a period when the western great powers were busy colonizing more accessible areas of the world, such as America, the Spice Islands, and India - i.e. places with trade goods that were arguably more desirable than fur (and even North America had its fair share of the latter). China was Russia's most direct - and only, really - challenger in the area until the 19th century, resulting in a number of territorial wars as Russia progressed eastwards. By the time Russia had settled its way to the Pacific, challenging its hegemony wasn't so much about the Siberian region itself (which is landlocked for all practical purposes) as it was about containment and settling durable borders. British rivalry with Russia reached its climax in the 19th century, particularly in Central Asia. Russia wanted warm water ports in the India Ocean. Great Britain feared that this might open an invasion route to India. Russia further feared British commercial and military incursions in Central Asia. The whole region was an arena of tension then. The two fought a number of land grab related wars in the area - though not between themselves - until borders settled in the late 19th century. This rivalry had consequences on the far eastern front, too. Russia sold Alaska to the US in the aftermath of the Crimean War. The Russian fear at the time was that they'd lose the territory to the British without compensation should another war break out between the two. Better Alaska in US hands, the thinking went, because the US wasn't much of a British friend then. The eastern frontier then became the main theater of tensions: rivalry with Japan over the two empires' ambitions in Manchuria and Korea started at around the same time as things calmed down in Central Asia. The two empires' relationships went from mostly friendly to hostile when Russia opted to support China in the aftermath of the first Sino-Japanese war. The Russo-Japanese War erupted a decade later, ultimately forcing Russia to abandon its expansionist policies there.
