A human can create new explanatory knowledge. A tiger can't, as illustrated by the lack of tiger music, or works of art, or science, or philosophy, or double entry book keeping. If the man dies, then all of the explanatory knowledge that he hasn't yet written down will be destroyed. And since this knowledge could in principle help generate a stream of benefits to you (directly or indirectly) that continues indefinitely that will be a bad loss. By contrast, if you kill the tiger and preserve a cell sample, then it may be possible to make more tigers in the future by cloning. The tigers will be identical for all practical purposes to the existing tiger. 

Many people decide some their ideas for reasons of personal belief or emotion. Different people decide different issues in this way. It isn't necessary to decide moral or policy questions by personal belief or emotion. And any given person has at least some moral or policy questions that he decides by critical discussion. For a long time, people on the left have been accustomed to imagining that all their ideas come about as a result of rational discussion, that their ideas are obvious and anyone who disagrees is therefore evil. As such, some lefties hounded anyone who disagreed with them and tried to destroy their lives and had some success with doing this, e.g. - biologists Tim Hunt $URL$ and James Watson $URL$ For a while, people on the right tried to deal with this by acting as if they were dealing with somebody interested in rational argument and contrition for wrongdoing. The righty would argue when he thought he was right and concede when he thought or felt he had made a mistake. He would imagine that this would stop the attack, but it wouldn't and he'd be thrown under the bus no matter what he did. Then some of the righties realised that many of their attackers had no interest in rational argument and contrition, and started to adjust their conduct accordingly. If somebody is going to wreck your life even if you argue or apologise, why bother? Why not just have fun or try to score political points at the expense of your attackers? This has started to catch on more widely on the right and the result is less grovelling by people who say things the left dislikes. For an explanation of this change see "SJWs always lie" by Vox Day. Whether or not you agree with the moral positions held by the author, it explains why right wing people stopped grovelling to left wing attackers. Some people on the left have interpreted this sudden cessation of grovelling as a brazen disregard for the Holy Truth of which they are the guardians. As a result, some lefties have started to regard everyone who openly disagrees with them and won't back down as 'post truth'. Most people have a lot of bad ideas whether they are left wing or right wing. There is no shortage of irrationality on either side. It would be better if each side could try to understand the other side's position and have a discussion. This is not currently happening and a lot of the responsibility for this state of affairs should be assigned to the left. 

In laissez faire capitalism, each person has the right to take or refuse any offer of trade, and is also free to make offers of trade. To do anything you need access to physical objects. To the extent that government infringes your property rights, the government uses force to stop you from using the means required to implement your rights. So laissez faire capitalism is required if you are going to exercise your rights. Some people think the government should provide certain goods as rights, e.g. - healthcare. But since healthcare has to be provided by somebody producing the goods required to treat people this would infringe his property rights. Now, you write: 

As Popper pointed out in Chapter I of "Realism and the Aim of Science" justification is impossible, unnecessary and undesirable. If you assess ideas using argument then the arguments have premises and rules of inference and the result of the argument may not be true (or probably true) if the premises and rules of inference are false. You might try to solve this by coming up with a new argument that proves the premises and rules of inference but then you have the same problem with those premises and rules of inference. You might say that some stuff is indubitably true (or probably true), and you can use that as a foundation. But that just means you have cut off a possible avenue of intellectual progress since the foundation can't be explained in terms of anything deeper. And in any case there is nothing that can fill that role. Sense experience won't work since you can misinterpret information from your sense organs, e.g. - optical illusions. Sense organs also fail to record lots of stuff that does exist, e.g. - neutrinos. Scientific instruments aren't infallible either since you can make mistakes in setting them up, in interpreting information from them and so on. We don't create knowledge (useful or explanatory information) by showing stuff is true or probably true for reasons so how do we create knowledge? We can only create knowledge by finding mistakes in our current ideas and correcting them piecemeal. You notice a problem with your current ideas, propose solutions, criticise the solutions until only one is left and then find a new problem. We shouldn't say that a theory is false because it hasn't been proven because this applies to all theories. Rather, we should look at what problems it aims to solve and ask whether it solves them. We should look at whether it is compatible with other current knowledge and if not try to figure out the best solution. Should the new idea be discarded or the old idea or can some variant of both solve the problem? There are metaphysical ideas, that is ideas that can't be empirically tested, that solve problems. For example, the idea that it is a good idea to empirically test theories when it is possible to do so, is not empirically testable. You can't specify what would count as a test without an explanation of the merits of testing, so any test would presuppose the idea that testing is worthwhile. 

There is currently no solution for the fine tuning problem, although there are some suggestions. One of the suggested solutions is the anthropic principle. Another suggestion is Lee Smolin's idea of universes giving rise to other universes as a result of black hole formation. According to Smolin means that universes that generate more black holes should be more plentiful, see his book "The Life of the Cosmos". Both the anthropic principle and the Smolin theory suffer from the problem that there is no well understood way to count the relevant universes. As such, neither theory makes any predictions about what values we should see, and they neither explain nor predict anything. I should mention that it is conceivable that the values of fundamental constants are not very relevant for the existence of life. It could be the case that life would arise under a wide range of different kinds of laws. But this is unknown since we lack the relevant explanation of how life would arise under those different laws. For more discussion of ideas along the lines given above, see "The Beginning of Infinity" by David Deutsch, pp. 96-103 and pp. 177-180. 

There are several reasons why belief in God persists. The first problem is that you say belief in god is inconsistent with science, which is true but rather more subtle than most atheists think. The standard criticism of theism is that science has proved theism false. This is not true. God could have made the world 6000 years ago, or two seconds ago and there would be no way to tell the difference because he could make the world exactly as it would be if it had existed for billions of years. The real reason not to adopt god is that his existence contradicts the explanations given by science. God's existence would contradict the only existing account of how complexity can arise: evolution. And it would replace the existing account with nothing since there is no explanation of how god can even be consistent. The second problem is moral. Secular moral philosophy is mostly so bad that it is impossible to enact it. Secular moral philosophers tend to present a particular menu of ideas like utilitarianism or virtue ethics or whatever without coming to any conclusions. Most of these ideas have severe flaws and even the least bad ones are vague oversimplifications of any viable position. And some philosophers are moral relativists. So many people still go to religious figures for moral guidance because secular moral philosophy mostly has nothing useful to say about solving real moral problems that arise in people's lives. If you want people to ditch religion you have to present clear criticisms and a clear viable alternative. Secular thinkers have mostly failed at both of those tasks. 

It is difficult to answer your question when you have not given the exact context. The term "realism" is sometimes used in the context of quantum mechanics to mean that measurable quantities always have single values. But you could also use realism in the sense of thinking that there is a world that exists apart from our measurements of it. The many worlds interpretation is not realist in the sense of requiring all observables to be single valued but it is realist in the sense of thinking that there is a world independent of our measurements of it. I'm going to address the possibility that what the lecturer was saying was intended to apply to the many worlds interpretation. Some advocates of the many worlds interpretation say that it is not necessary to define measurement because measurements do not play a fundamental role in physics. Rather, some interactions copy information between systems so that it is present in more than one system after the interaction where it was present in only one system before. If somebody happens to take note of the result of such an interaction then they may describe it as a measurement but that is not a fundamental part of the laws of physics and so measurement is not part of such laws and realists shouldn't have it as a distinct category. I do subscribe to the many worlds interpretation but not to that theory of measurement because I think it is uncritical. Some interactions are more suited to be measurements than others and this is a result of their physical properties, so the theory of measurement should be considered part of the laws of physics. 

You provide no specific citations to Marx. You also say you haven't read the communist manifesto, which is quite short and say you have only read a summary written by somebody else. I am sceptical that what you say accurately represents Marx's ideas, and nothing I say should be construed as a reply to Marx, but rather to the ideas you attribute to him. In general you should not attribute ideas to authors you haven't read. 

Some of Leonard Peikoff's work is very good, such as "Understanding Objectivism." Elliot Temple has made some improvements on Objectivism, such as correcting some problems with Objectivist epistemology: $URL$ See also: $URL$ George Reisman's book "Capitalism" explains a lot of economics from an Objectivist/Austrian economics point of view: $URL$ 

No. The only existing explanation of the EPR experiment requires that systems carrying information about the results of the experiments, such as the measuring instrument, wires transmitting the results and so on are described by Heisenberg picture observables. Those observables describe objects existing in multiple versions, see $URL$ $URL$ The same is true for other experiments such as single particle interference experiments, as illustrated by the so-called delayed choice experiment. 

False. The theory of evolution claims that human beings have common ancestors with other species. It makes no claims about humans being on a continuum with other species. An organism's phenotype is given by the way its genes are activated in its environment. The genes do all the heavy lifting of making complex biological structures. They can hold information and can be passed on from parents to children, or from one organism to another in other ways, e.g. - plasmids passing between bacteria. Variants on genes arise by mutation. Any given set of genes either manage to make a copy of themselves, or they don't. This process of variation followed by selection creates knowledge in the sense of problem solving information in the genes that survive. Now, it is true that any given change in functionality produced by evolution has to be small. But many small changes can give rise to a qualitative change. For example, there may be a sequence of animals that lead from ground dwelling reptiles to flying birds. But there is a qualitative difference between an animal that can take off starting on the ground without a ledge or tree branch to jump off and an animal that can't do that. And no amount of saying "I don't know how the transition happened" is at all relevant to that fact. 

A meme is specifically a culturally transmissible unit of information. Duplicating culturally transmissible information is not necessarily the same thing as duplicating thoughts. For example, lots of people learn arithmetic but different people may think about how to do arithmetic in different ways. Now it could be the case that one particular way of thinking about doing maths is better than another, i.e. - people can do maths faster with it or understand the results better. But if nobody puts time and effort into figuring out how to transmit that method culturally it won't be a meme. so there is a distinction between memes and thoughts. Moreover, when somebody figures out how to transmit an idea culturally he adds to its content and may substantially change it. So the meme version of the idea may be very different to what he was doing originally. Another distinction between memes and ideas is that a person may think that he does not hold a particular meme when in fact he does. A parent may get annoyed with a child when the child disobeys the parent's instructions. The parent might then say "Do X because I said so." The parent may think that this is not his actual position, he has a very good reason he just can't explain it right now. But the parent is wrong. If he had some fabulous explanation and he wanted to tell the child he would do so. He literally does want the child to do X because he said so and not for any independent reason. Such ideas are not transmitted by people understanding their content, but by patterns of behaviour that help shield the content from being thought about and criticised. For the best available discussion of memes, see "The Beginning of Infinity" by David Deutsch, chapters 15 and 16, which have detailed discussions of meme transmission and of similarities and differences between memes and genes. 

This is a very bad idea. As Popper pointed out if an experiment seems to contradict a theory you have two options: ditch the theory or reinterpret the result. In either case, as long as your fix can be tested independently of the problem it was originally intended to solve, it doesn't matter much which option you take. (See "Logic of Scientific Discovery", section 29.) For example, if you think your telescope has a fault that caused you to miss some predicted astronomical event, then you could test the lenses or their alignment by looking at known targets, shining a laser beam through the telescope to see where it goes and there may be other better ideas. But you shouldn't take the attitude that it is okay to have experimental results that contradict your theory since that will block progress to better ideas. The quote below is wrong as Popper was explicitly against what Kuhn described as normal science: 

There are people who understood book keeping better than Marx. The labour theory of value was refuted shortly after it was proposed: $URL$ Since Marx's theory of accounting is dependent on the labour theory of value it is false. If you want to understand accounting, profit and loss and that sort of thing you should read some economists who have ideas that haven't been refuted, such as the Austrian school of economics: $URL$ 

The emphasis is mine, not his. No argument for anything can be constructed on empiricist foundations or on any other foundations. If you assess ideas using argument then the arguments have premises and rules of inference and the result of the argument may not be true (or probably true) if the premises and rules of inference are false. You might try to solve this by coming up with a new argument that proves the premises and rules of inference but then you have the same problem with those premises and rules of inference. You might say that some stuff is indubitably true (or probably true), and you can use that as a foundation. But that just means you have cut off a possible avenue of intellectual progress since the foundation can't be explained in terms of anything deeper. And in any case there is nothing that can fill that role. Sense experience won't work since you can misinterpret information from your sense organs, e.g. - optical illusions. Sense organs also fail to record lots of stuff that does exist, e.g. - neutrinos. Scientific instruments aren't infallible either since you can make mistakes in setting them up, in interpreting information from them and so on. We don't create knowledge (useful or explanatory information) by showing stuff is true or probably true for reasons so how do we create knowledge? We can only create knowledge by finding mistakes in our current ideas and correcting them piecemeal. You notice a problem with your current ideas, propose solutions, criticise the solutions until only one is left and then find a new problem. We shouldn't say that a theory is false because it hasn't been proven because this applies to all theories. Rather, we should look at what problems it aims to solve and ask whether it solves them. We should look at whether it is compatible with other current knowledge and if not try to figure out the best solution. Should the new idea be discarded or the old idea or can some variant of both solve the problem? In the light of this there is another problem with what Mackie is saying. He specifies that morality would tell an agent to do something that is not contingent on "any present desire". But any position can be undermined by proposing criticisms it can't answer and an alternative that solves the resulting problems. Present desires are no different from any other position in this respect. But then how to we find moral knowledge? The answer is that you specify some goal and work out what sort of behaviour would be required to do it if you take it seriously as an explanation and apply it universally. And it turns out that no matter what goal you choose maximising the extent to which you can do it pushes you in the direction of doing some things and not others. And if you choose the wrong goal, that's all right too since the goal can be corrected by critical discussion in the light of other explanations. For more on this topic see $URL$
