The answer is go for the biggest and the best. Blow up Jupiter! If Jupiter can be destroyed with surgical precision, so we can safely assume its moons will be left intact, then the collateral damage will be minimal. More so, if your pyrotechnic explodomaniac alien waits until Jupiter on the other side of the Sun when the explosion occurs. Jupiter is approximately half a light hour distant from Earth. Its moons will be mainly in Jupiter orbit. While the Jovian barycentre is dispersing across the solar system, the moons will retain their velocity around the Sun and any additional velocity they effectively acquire due to their orbital velocities around Jupiter. Generally this will mean the moons will either move into higher or lower heliocentric orbits. Essentially they will be half a light hour away from the earth and the centre of the solar system, so the Sun and the Earth are safe. The OP hasn't specified the precise method for making planets going KA-BOOM!! So it is possible that whatever remains of Jupiter might constitute hazardous materials and fragments for the inner solar system. But this should be considered as quite unlikely because the orbital velocities of Jupiter and its moons indicates that Jovian matter and the moons will remain far from earth. However, if the aliens are zealous in their regard for human life they enjoy taking pot shots and blowing up any fragments that might be heading towards the Earth. But if their method for precisely demolishing Jupiter is sufficiently precise, then they could be capable of blasting Jupiter away from the Sun. Shoot so it gets blasted out and away. This means there shouldn't be problems for the sky falling in on Earthlings. 

This may be old fashioned but 'telepathy' or plain 'mind-reading' will pass muster. if there are other telepaths who can communicate mind-to-mind, then you might want to differentiate your character's version of telepathy from theirs by giving it a different name. You could call it 'mind-scanning' if you want to coin a new name. The character could be called a 'scanner' but that has been done but there's nothing to stop from being reused. perhaps it could be simply 'mind-sight'. However, if you want to be fancy it could be called 'psychescopic' (literally 'mind-seeing') adjectivally. The noun would be psychescopy. I'd even suggest finding out what the equivalent word(s) of mind-reading or telepathy is in another language, say, German or Norwegian or Japanese and use that. 

It's all terrorism, of course. Well, perhaps, not all. As other answers have suggested pretending it was natural disasters would help too. At least, it would break the monotony of claiming supernatural battles was the work of terrorists. Presumably there is a power-sharing between the governments and the supernaturals. Basically neither governments or supernaturals are entirely stupid, so it would be in their best interests to come to an agreement. We cover your supernatural slugfests, and when we need really, really your help you supernaturals will come to the aid of the party. 

Your chemiluminescent signalling critter will need to produce nitric oxide and ozone and combine them in dermal cells to do its signalling. Ozone is a hazardous substance for live tissue and organs, so the critter will have to manage the ozone carefully. So provided you have a creature that can make sufficient nitric oxide and ozone, then it can send signals chemiluminescently. 

That twenty percent larger is a worry. The smaller Earth could end up inside the bigger one. Also, if they truly amalgamate their combined mass will raise the surface gravity of the new Earth. However, let's the amalgamation magic works, well, its magic and both Earths are shuffled and dealt to form a new combined world. For the sake of convenience the excess mass has been converted into energy to power the process of conversion into one world. The inhabitants of what is becoming the one world will see cities popping up where there no cities before. Coastlines will change as their features are combined to make the coastlines. People will suddenly have new neighbours. Wild animals will find their habitats suddenly in the middle of cities. If there are only intelligent inhabitants on one Earth, and presumably, not on the other then the adaptation will be fairly straight forward. They will warn everyone when it's going to happen. Wait for the landscape to stop changing and just get on with their new world. Cartographers and map makers will have a field day. It is probable some features will be lost in the transformation. Stands to reason really. We can't have everything. If both former Earths will be inhabited, then the inhabitants of the Earth where they know this is going to happen will have the drop on the inhabitants of unaware Earth. But there could be circumstances the people of one Earth change sides with people of the other Earth because this new Earth is more suitable for than under the old regime. This could be like an invasion with a few rebellions thrown in for good measure. Obviously the Earth that has known this is going to happen for thousand of years in advance will have the advantage to take over the inhabitants of the other Earth once the amalgamation occurs. A magical invasion that turns into instant occupation. 

It's all about dramatic impact. Crew escaping the damaged in escape pods can be seen escaping. They rush into the pod. The hatch smashed shut prior to launch. Their lifepod is ejected into space. Sound effects, figures reacting to the acceleration. The crippled ship can be seen exploding at that final dramatic moment. Exciting stuff. Now if they escape via the transporters (and for convenience it is assumed the transporters can teleport crew the light hours to the nearest habitable planet) everybody just queues up and disappears in a shimmering glow. It will take hours for the light from the exploding ship to reach the planet and by then it will be too small to be seen. Less than exciting stuff. They might as well pack a picnic lunch. Also, if the teleportation doesn't have the range to reach the habitable planet, naturally they will head to the escape pods. Mostly this is a question of applying commonsense to be able to answer this question. Of course, the real life explanation is simple. The authors, if it's prose fiction, and script writers, if it's on a visual medium, rarely think through their worldbuilding sufficiently to know what choices they have to allow the crew escape in safety. Film and tv producers know escape pods will always win the dramatic department. PS: A well-trained crew won't panic chaotically. They will have rehearsed their escape drill many, many times. To survive they will go to their appointed stations to either board their designated escape pod or teleportation transmitter. That's what's shipboard discipline is for: to ensure disasters in space can be dealt with safely. 

In a world where vampires and to some degree magic exist, then these can be considered natural factors. The land of eternal night is caused by a magically created optical barrier floating above this territory. This is effectively a one-way mirror reflecting back most of the daylight during the, what we can only call, day. Effectively it will be no brighter than dusk, but the vampire territory will languish in permanent night. It can be assumed that once it was created magically this mirror layer will remain there until the last vampire is gone. This will save on having to renew the magic to keep the mirror layer functioning. There is no need to assume that this mirror has a solid or particulate surface, it is merely a surface where light is reflected by the optical properties of the space constituting the layer itself. 

This rebuttal was made in 1975 over concerns about thermonuclear weapons. It was not the first and, probably not the last. This was first raised in the 1940s during the Manhattan Project and immediately prior to the Trinity test. Amusingly it was even raised during the development of nuclear weapons by Nazi Germany. 

Deciding a planet was habitable depends on looking for the presence of molecules that indicate life is present on the planet. The most likely candidates are water, oxygen, and chlorophyll. As discussed in this paper here Since the planet in question is lifeless and devoid of atmosphere, the presence of water, oxygen and chlorophyll seems unlikely. But if they were present, this give a false positive. So in what circumstances would any of these substances be present to give a false positive? Firstly, water is most detectable of the trio of life-signatures. What if aliens coated the planet with a layer of water to give a false reading? The coating wouldn't cover the entire planet. Just enough to make it look like an inhabitable planet. The water would have to be contained in thin sandwich of materials that would be transparent in the bandwidths used for detection of water. If necessary, the aliens might plant oxygen and chlorophyll in similar layers to increase the probability of fooling non-alien astronomers. Deliberative fraud is a possible explanation for why astronomers were deceived into believing they had observed a habitable planet. As for reasons why the aliens have done this can be left an exercise for the reader. 

Languages naturally and somewhat inevitably continually change and modify themselves over time. Usually this involves simplifying those languages and dropping exceptions. English is full of exceptions. For example, 'contemptible' and not 'contemptable'. As the OP suggested all past tense verbs could be affixed with "ed". Changes of this sort can be witnessed in confusion between simple words such as "it's" and "its" where "it's" is the contraction of the phrase "it is" and "its" is possessive of something belonging to a thing (not a person either female or male). The use of apostrophes is changing. Once "Tom's book" would have been correct, but now "Toms book" is correct for the possessive form of the book belonging to Tom. Persons with old brains would think "Toms" was the plural form of Tom (i.e., there was more than one Tom related to the book). This is in a transitional phase. Both usages are correct. Useful guidance can be in this style guide about the use of the apostrophe. This discussion about the apostrophes as a common error provides background to the issues about the use and misuse of the apostrophe. A search has been unable to locate an online source for the dropping of the apostrophe from possessives. This author has actually sighted the text of a style guide that proposed dropping the apostrophe from possessive words, thereby making them indistinguishable from plurals. Languages are continually changing. Usually those changes will simplify the language. Indeed languages in their earliest forms have remarkably precise word usages and often have elaborate and complicated grammars. There have been a variety of artificial languages and spelling reform campaigns to both streamline language usage and make them easier to learn and acquire. The most successful example of language reform is Simplified Chinese. This was government mandated, because reforms of this kind require the highest level of authority. Side-note: Members of the Chinese diaspora who have grown up with Traditional Chinese often detest Simplified Chinese. It would be interesting to compare their opinions with Mainland Chinese who were inculcated with Simpler version from birth. Language change over time tends to simplify and adopt systematic forms for word usage. It is unlikely that governments will be instigating major language reforms any time soon. 

The concept of interplanetary travel by railgun isn't entirely feasible. When O'Neill and his associates were developing the concept of L5 space habitats they experimented with mass drivers as a method of launching vehicles. They discovered that there was a limit to the maximum velocity mass drivers or as here gauss cannons could attain. At higher velocities the vehicles wreck their electromagnetic launchers. This limiting velocity was 4 km/s. Now vehicles could be launched from orbit to this velocity. The vehicles' velocity, due to the gauss cannon, can be added to its orbital velocity. vehicles could be launched from an earthlike planet with a velocity of 12 km/s. This does produce feasible interplanetary travel. The travel times will be fairly long. Six to eight months travel time to planets in the equivalent of the orbits of Mars and Venus in your hypothetical solar system. Upwards of many years for travel to other planets. It will work but it will be slow. This form of travel is roughly on a par with chemical rockets. But fusion, plasma and ion drives will perform better and faster. 

Source: Expanding Earth If instead of this being a discredited geological hypothesis, what if this expanding Earth turned out to be real. Then the land rise would be a natural result of the expanding Earth in the post-apocalyptic future. The Expanding Earth theory isn't a joke, this was a genuine scientific hypothesis. The author of this answer had the strange experience of sitting in a lecture given one of the major proponents of this theory, S. Warren Carey, the Professor of Geology at the University of Tasmania. Since this is Worldbuilding, there's no reason why the concept can't be used here. 

The same way any micro-nation does: pay your taxes, put Australian stamps on your letters along with your micro-nation's stamps, and don't rock the boat. Do nothing that will upset the governments of Western Australia and the Commonwealth of Australia. Micro-nations are dime a dozen. They are invariably tolerated because it's too much trouble to get rid of them. Australia already has its own fair share of micro-nations. Of course, the territory you want to claim is among the driest in Australia. Therefore, you can add die of thirst to your list. Also, the territory you want to claim are indigenous lands. They are unlikely to take your seizure of their lands lying down. Quite rightly too. Your population is unlikely to grow. No-one in their right mind would want to live there. Indigenous communities have had forty thousand years to adapt themselves to the land and its conditions. The stability of government is also severely in doubt considering your new country is only likely to attract the fruit cakes and nut cases. Not exactly the sort of population that is going to be stable. Australia's governments will let your country whither, shrivel up and die. of course, any of your citizens are foolish enough to break their laws. They will as dual citizens (although one of their citizenships is in doubt) be dragged before Australian courts and summarily thrown in the slammer (if found guilty). As micro-nations go, this one is doomed from the beginning. 

In essence the two World Wars accelerated the development of the aeroplane. Once the aeroplane outstripped the airship its dominance in the skies was at an end. However, this didn't happen immediately and while airships don't play as big a role in aviation they have the potential for long-endurance flight. Therefore, in a world where history ran differently and the two World Wars didn't happen the aeroplane wouldn't have had its accelerated development in the nineteen-teens it is plausible the airship would have lasted longer. Considering the importance of helium as a lifting gas, possibly if there had been more abundant sources of helium and especially outside the USA the airship might have been more viable.
