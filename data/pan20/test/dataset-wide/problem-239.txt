It's not that far fetched to believe that the alien technology will be fragile. Our most advanced technology (aircraft, spacecraft, laboratory robotics) are in fact quite fragile. One of the main difficulties in space travel is that the energy required scales up dramatically with mass, and this would be even more the case in travel between stars. There is currently a project called Breakthrough Starshot that's investigating sending tiny wafer-thin sensing devices from Earth to the next closest star system at about 20% of the speed of light. If successful, these will be tiny incredibly fragile devices, built to be as light as possible. They'll barely have the capability to take some readings and pictures of the surrounding area and send them back to Earth. Certainly the designers aren't going to give any thought to security or defense. The attacker in an interstellar war has one big disadvantage: they have to move their force across an incredibly large distance, with all the logistical problems that entails, weakening them the entire way. Now imagine there's an alien race on the receiving end of these Breakthrough Starshot probes. Assuming they could figure out the basic purpose and mechanisms that make them work (possibly by intercepting a transmission from one back to Earth), it may be quite simple to interrupt their function. That's really the root question: can we understand how the alien technology works, and what its limitations are? If we can, there's a good chance we can find a weakness and exploit it. Of course, one can always come up with a more powerful technology. Some kind of grey goo bomb could be delivered almost undetectably and relatively inexpensively across interstellar distances, and cause enormous destruction once it arrives. What you're really sending in that case is self-replicating information - a pattern that makes copies of itself. Information is one of the least expensive things to send anywhere. However, we do have ways of combating self-replicating machines (in fact we have them here now and call them bacteria and viruses). In general, we look at them under a microscope, figure out how they work, and attack them in one of two ways: quarantine, or medicine. Medicine is just a form of chemical attack on the device... figure out something it needs and take it away, or figure out how it works, and introduce a chemical that sabotages it. The basis of self-replication on Earth is DNA and we have a pretty good understanding of how it works, but also how to stop it. 

Given the age of the solar system, and the fact it's made up of stuff from earlier solar systems, if there was another physical mechanism with these same properties and the tendency to actually occur naturally, it's likely it would have happened by now, and we would see lots of it everywhere. The only explanation for not seeing it is that the conditions on Earth, and on other bodies we've visited, aren't suitable for this stuff to exist. 

There. A powerful, beautiful creative concept. Just so we're clear. :-) Now, to, you know, actually answer the question you're asking... 

The way the question is asked, and the way the overwhelming physical resources of the orwellian systems is framed, it seems that the only true vulnerabilities will reside in 

Constraint #2: Ye cannae change the laws of physics. Also, magic can't change the climate. The After Oil series editor, John Michael Greer, proprietor of The Archdruid Report, put out his call for submissions in contest form. Here's the official statement of the contest rules: 

Our species is hard-wired for a lot of things; but one of them, which seems to be irreducible, is the need to be useful. Take that away from people, and you get all sorts of social pathologies: 

So, there you have it. I stated my constraints at length; thank you for reading them; please treat them as they are. I'm working within them, not building a world from scratch. :-) 

Flying dragons would have a much stronger advantage in tactical mobility than that conferred by Viking longships; and the horrifying effectiveness of dragonfire against agricultural targets would be decisive. As a result, your answer is going to be limited to two reasonable worldbuilding techniques: 

In this unusually fast warming scenario, agriculture, along with other means of obtaining food over time such as hunting, fishing, and animal husbandry, will all fail because of the ecological collapse. Humans in an intense global warming event would die off, probably, because they couldn't sustain themselves and their food supply over the long term. 

@Wick, I suspect many, if not most, of your concerns with respect to the theory and practice of teleportation are addressed in Larry Niven's essay EXERCISE IN SPECULATION: THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF TELEPORTATION. The essay is adapted from a talk Niven gave at Boskone, the New England Science Fiction Association conference which is reliably packed with MIT students. So Niven knew he couldn't get away with non-rigorous handwaving, and had to look fairly carefully at the various scenarios. Since he has a good working knowledge of physics and has read a lot of science fiction, there's a lot of good solid speculative science in it. Among other things, Niven goes into a good amount of detail about the kinds of issues @JonOfAllTrades raises: conservation of momentum and energy. My own favorite zany speculation is the design for the "end-teleport drive", a spaceship that teleports itself onto its own front end. That's just glorious. 

Cool question, and potentially a pretty cool world. :-) A few responses to your proposed planet and civilization, working towards questions of transportation: Planetology of a forest world There's a bit of a problem in your initial description of the planet: 

Yes, I know, that Bill gates did not actually say it. But lets say he did say it, and actually he was right. If anything goes above 640K of RAM, it causes Stack Overflow and crashes (pun in link intended). And no one knows why Obviously, this is then "engineering issue" and people would be hacking their systems to be able to work with such limitations. Great example of what can be done with known set of limitations, are consoles. If you compare first game for given gaming console, and the last one, you will be amazed what power can be "juiced out" from given console. So this could in theory provide Undo to computers, but it would be pricy feature * Dear lawyers, this sentence was said by alternate Bill Gates in alternate Universe. If you want to sue me for this, please do it in alternate reality. Thank you 4) We never realised it can be done "Oh shoot, I accidentally made the whole spreadsheet red" "Well, you will have to work overtime to fix it." "I wonder if there could be better way to..." "No, there is not." Obviously the least plausible explanation of the whole situation. We know people like to hack their machines, and since the whole free software community is around, I would not recommend going this way Way around: 4-eye principle: Even now, in our glorious* current universe, there are processes which cannot be undone. One of ways around it is to require second person to confirm such action before that action goes live. * Subjective feelings of "glorious" can vary. Please do not sue me. 

EDIT: Burning down my house? Did I go mad? No, not at all. First, the Stone Age in the title caused me thinking that the population of the humanoids is really low. So, basically, there have to be big unhabited areas - perfect spot to burn them down. Obviously this strategy has some downfalls, but, I am in anti-hippie mode. So stop hugging the trees and burn them :) EDIT 2: But you would not burn down your house, would you? No, I would not burn down my own home. And I do not expect the tree people do the same. I am just expecting them to provide some space for themselves. See this quickly drawn picture: 

When talking about magical Orbs or Mirrors, we have mostly in mind above picture. Skilful mage operates hard to obtain device. But what if Shrek 2 approach would be in place? 

Those pesky humans. We, Evil Overlords have a tough job with them. They can be set to slaves, but only for relatively short period of time. They promise you loyalty ... and snap! There is a knife stabbed in your back. Let's get rid of humans and develop servant creatures Step 1: Killing them all I am Evil Genius and I possess DNA manipulation device, which can create me any animal I would like. Now it is time, to develop a creature which can kill as many people as possible. But, how should such animal look like? And: While simple rats or mosquitoes are great killing machines, they do not kill humans directly. They are just helping diseases to spread. I want this to be personal. I want the animal directly attack humans and kill them. And eat them (who has time to hide all the bodies?) I call you, my evil henchmen. What do you suggest? EDIT Oops! I forgot one vital info: I am human too. So those creatures should not kill me. Obviously ;) 

This seems to match the original question's intent. pre-"state" human bands There are basically three kinds of associations in history that predate states and that rely on intuitive, rather than explicit, theories of political legitimacy. These three types of community are fundamentally distinguished by their ecological characteristics. They are: 

These factors tend to be self-correcting, or at any rate short-lived. However, in their heyday, they create surges of piratical activity that seem to erupt, and remain intractable, for a while until the conditions do in fact change. (See The Golden Age of Piracy.) However, there's another kind of piratical scenario that may be more useful for your purposes, because it's got more staying power: Asymmetrical warfare. A handy example is the modern-day situation of Somali piracy, in which the pirates began as fishermen whose livelihoods were reportedly wrecked by toxic waste dumping and illegal overfishing in their traditional fishing grounds. According to the article, the fishermen-turned-pirates have, over the last few years, mostly become criminal gangs rather than resistance fighters, and enforcement efforts have severely reduced the Somali pirates' activities. However, this is a somewhat different situation than the Golden Age piracy. 

[Note: I got most of the foregoing from The Rise of the West, by William H. McNeill; originally published in 1963, it's still in print and not freely available online. FWIW, I'd recommend it as a resource for any worldbuilder interested in the processes of prehistoric and historical development of human communities.] 

I especially like the answers from Bokai and Abulafia, who cite Toynbee and Systems Theory respectively. I think those are the most generally powerful and descriptive. To pull it all together, I'd recommend John Michael Greer's posts on the nature of empire. In a 3-piece series starting with $URL$ Greer applies his serious scholarship in both Toynbee's theories of history and Systems Theory, and a lot more besides (such as the work of Oswald Spengler and Joseph Tainter), and boils it down into a very well-written overview. 

The nature of feudalism Feudalism is probably best described as fractally distributed authoritarianism. It means that political power is (theoretically) organized as a tree structure, with obligations of fealty that go up the tree (and sometimes down; European feudalism had formal recognition of bidirectional obligations, while the samurai of medieval Japan conceptualized their loyalty to their lord as one-way and absolute.) This means that any subset of the political structure is potentially autonomous. Let's say, and why not, that you are a medieval European Baron, and you owe feudal duty to a King. What happens when the King dies without an heir? Well, you pretty much keep going: running your barony, intriguing against your neighbors, keeping the Vikings or whomever at bay as best you can. At some point, you will be offered opportunities to swear fealty to some kind of suzerain; you may even take part in the intrigues attendant on creating a successor's claim to the throne... The point, of course, is that the death or loss of legitimacy on the part of a leader does not cause as much widespread ruin. The system reconfigures itself, more or less naturally. This creates a very stable political situation. Probably the most stable that could be contrived, given the tumultuous nature of medieval times. That resilience is the core benefit of feudalism. Where it comes apart, historically, is when a society starts generating enough economic surplus, or encounters sufficiently uncharted circumstances, that feudal suppression of the peasant base becomes insufficient as a political model. I've recently heard Democracy described as "the crowdsourcing of political decisionmaking", and I don't think that's entirely wrong. A secondary downfall of the feudal model would be when economic and technological factors make it impossible for the nobility to sustain its position. This is often characterized in historical recapitulation as "when central governments got cannon and could reduce castles at will". That, however, is an historical artifact of European history. Your question isn't about that. Would it be possible for a sufficiently powerful (politically and technologically) 'elite' class to oppress the masses and re-enforce a feudal style society? The best answer I can give you is another question: Can your envisioned high-tech society provide a set of circumstances in which:
