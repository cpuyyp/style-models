Certainly, the figure only uses different masses because that's the more general possibility (after all, the two masses won't be exactly the same). In fact, if you look at the distribution over mass ratio q in binary systems in Figure 1b in $URL$ it seems that the cumulative number of binaries with mass ratio less than q is more or less equal to q (where q is smaller mass over larger mass). That means the probability of mass ratio between any q and q+dq is about equal to dq and nearly independent of q. So the chance of the mass ratio being between 0.9 and 1 is about the same as being between 0 and 0.1, for example. In some sense, that's like saying all q are equally likely. And of course if q is near 1, then the stars will have the same age and be in the same evolutionary state, so will be the same stellar type as well. 

The question is interesting, but I suspect the answer is that the Moon will never show its "dark side" to the Earth, because there are differences between the side that faces us and the dark side that suggest there is something quite permanent about its orientation. So while the rotation was locking, it either settled into a state of minimum potential that it has maintained ever since, or it built up the differences between the side we see and the side we don't after it tidally locked, but either way, this means it has showed us the same side for billions of years, so will likely continue to do that. I don't think anything would likely knock it out, but we can't rule out chaotic orbital effects so I don't really know. The Moon's orbit varies a lot with time, so maybe it's possible that the orbit itself could change, showing us the other side of the Moon. Or, an asteroid hit or some such thing might occur. A billion years is a long time, but I'll bet humanity will always see the same side from Earth. 

One way to answer this is to say that conservation of energy is a law intended to be applied in a single reference frame-- it is not intended to work if you change reference frames. It is true that general relativity makes this an even more difficult point, because it's not just changing reference frames there, but a simpler question appears even in special relativity. If a source of light is moving away from you, and that source is turned on for awhile and then turned off, receivers who are moving away from that source will detect less total light energy than those not moving away. This is true even if the source is a beam that goes entirely into the detector. Thus you could equally ask, if the detector moves away, and detects less energy, where did the missing energy go? The answer is, there is not any missing energy. The detector moving away always reckoned there was less energy in that beam, and that less energy was conserved the whole time. Conservation of energy is within a given reference frame-- even the energy of a bullet gets much less if you change to the reference frame of the bullet. 

As per the above comments, there will still be v=Hd, if v is the rate of change of current distance, and d is the current distance-- as long as the universe continues to obey the cosmological principle. The nearby version of that will still look like correlating Doppler-shift velocity to distance indicators, and the faraway version will require a dynamical model, albeit a very simple one due to dark energy. It will lead to a constant H that will not be anything like the inverse of the age of the universe. And if you go too far into the future, you won't be able to see the CMB, or quasars, so alien cosmology will really struggle. 

In my mind, none of these explanations really cover the actual reason that red giants expand. Indeed, this subject seems like an area where people just make up anything that sounds plausible, but it's often quite wrong (Fraser Cain mentions both light pressure and a higher volume in the fusing shell, but light pressure plays no role at all, and the volume of the shell isn't much different than the core, which is way smaller than the Sun's core). So let's get the story straight. Many of the descriptions do include some of the key elements, including the fact that you have a shell of hydrogen fusion going on atop an inert degenerate helium core. But the key reason for the expansion is that the way this shell self-regulates its fusion rate is quite a bit different from the way the Sun's core is self-regulating its fusion now. Now, the Sun's core self-regulates its fusion rate to match the rate that energy (in the form of light) is diffusing out through the mass of the Sun. The way it does this is essentially the same in all main-sequence stars: they regulate their core temperature, which is why the core temperature of more luminous main-sequence stars is a little higher. But this is not at all the way the shell fusing in a red giant self-regulates its fusion rate-- it cannot regulate its temperature, because the temperature is handed to it by the gravity of the degenerate core its sits upon. (This sets the temperature via the virial theorem, that is the key way the degenerate core affects the shell-- it sets its temperature.) Since the shell doesn't regulate its own temperature, the temperature tends to be quite high, especially as the core gains mass (this is why the luminosity rises with time). Fusion is very sensitive to temperature, so being stuck with a very high temperature makes the fusion rate go berserk. The rest of the star cannot support this spectacular fusion rate, so something else happens. The star puffs out, and in so doing, we find the way the shell regulates its own fusion rate: it lifts weight off the shell. That reduces the pressure in the shell, which compensates for the high temperature and brings the fusion rate down to what the rest of the star can manage (which is set by the rate light can diffuse through the shell). So there's the real reason-- the star must find a way to lift weight off its crazy-high-temperature shell to keep the fusion rate from going nuts, but the upshot is that the fusion rate is still pretty high, and gets higher as the mass of the core rises, forcing the shell temperature up ever more and forcing the star to puff out even more. 

The term "zero age Main sequence" is there only because during main-sequence evolution, hydrogen is turned to helium, changing the stellar structure a little (electrons are eaten up, light escapes more easily, so the luminosity rises for example). Yet all stars along that process are called "main-sequence stars." So the "zero-age" subset is simply a term for eliminating confusion about what the rising helium content is doing, it's not intended to be a statement about the actual age of the star. When astronomers talk about the age of a star, it's the age before the ZAMS, plus the age after the ZAMS. Usually the distinction doesn't matter, because main-sequence lifetimes tend to be much longer than pre-main-sequence lifetimes. This is convenient, because it is not possible to identify an exact moment when a star "first forms." The situation is made even more unclear when you look at the formal definition of a "star," which is almost never used in practice but requires that the object be undergoing fusion. So if you believe that definition, the ZAMS is also the birth of the star, and its age is the age on the main-sequence. No one actually uses that poor language, because we do actually want to talk about the pre-main-sequence lifetime of a star! I suppose it would be a bit like counting the 9 months we are in the womb as part of our "lifetime," but this is the standard for what is done in professional astronomy (though not for human lifetimes). 

You are right that helium around a gas giant is no kind of surprise, and oxygen on an Earthlike planet would be spectacularly more important. However, the excitement is simply that if you can detect one element, it means you might be able to detect another. It just gives you more ways to learn about the planet, and offers promise for more new ways to learn. One might find analogy with the first detection of exoplanets, which were "hot Jupiters." No one was surprised stars can have planets, and no one thinks hot Jupiters are conducive to life, but if you can discover one kind of planet, it bodes well for the later discovery of others. Anything we can learn about composition is an important step in the right direction. 

The Moon has a "Roche lobe", where the Moon's gravity dominates, and all you need for the situation you describe is that the Roche lobe lies physically outside the Moon. That will be true, because the Lagrange points are on the outside edge of that Roche lobe, and it's outside the Moon. The Moon's Roche lobe is shown here: $URL$ 

And here's another way to frame the situation. Degeneracy is not responsible for the pressure in the electrons in a white dwarf, they would have that same pressure once the star contracts to the same size even if it was all ideal gas (say, if the electrons were distinguishable). What is meant by "degeneracy pressure" is the perfectly mundane kinetic gas pressure that happens to be reached at the point where the Pauli exclusion principle makes it impossible for the star to lose any more heat, so it cannot contract any further. Notice this also means that the "degeneracy pressure" limit for a given star is the maximum pressure the star can attain. This surprises some people, who are inclined to think of degeneracy pressure as a kind of minimum below which the pressure cannot fall, but that would be true for a gas in a box of constant volume, not a self-gravitating contracting star. 

I'd say it's an open question awaiting some observational evidence that it can happen. It presumably would depend a lot on what kind of situation you are looking for, and what would you call a flare on one star setting off a flare on the other. Certainly you'd need two stars that both have active atmospheres and are in a close binary, such that one mass ejection could interfere enough with the magnetic configuration in the other star to set off a flare. Some stars may be so close together that the magnetic configuration of their atmospheres actually connect both stars, so then when get a flare you might see brightenings on both stars but it would be essentially the same flare. There are even stars called "contact binaries" where it's not even all that clear if you should think of that as two stars that touch (and share a magnetosphere), or just one star that has two separate cores. But the bottom line is, it sounds like you'd need something unusual going on, involving two stars that were unusually close together and are interacting in some way. You might want to read up on "RS CVn stars," for example. 

My advice would be to not seek a definition that is "official," because official definitions will often not serve the application you have in mind. Just say what you want to say, tailored to that application. We'd like definitions to be instructions for sorting everything that is from everything that isn't, but in practice they actually can't work that way. For example, what is the official definition of a "computer", that works in any context? At one level, the definition of a star should include whatever objects people who regard themselves as "stellar astronomers" study, because it is the commonality among all such stars that unites them. But most "official" definitions of a "star" already exclude many of the objects that "stellar astronomers" study! (The same holds for "planets.") So although official definitions do exist, they are often not what you want in your application. That's why I say, just define what you mean yourself, and don't even try to be "official." For example, if your interest is in stellar evolution, and you are not interested in endpoints because they are not still evolving, then say stars that are still evolving. If your interest is stars that obey an ideal gas law, you might favor a term like "ordinarily gaseous stars," or some such thing. Tailoring to the interest gives a better definition than something "official."
