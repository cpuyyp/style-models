¿How do you tell if a person is vegetarian? Test the microbiota. The population of microbies in the gut is a function of diet, drug treatments, etc.(See, for instance, this article.) The procedure would only require a stool sample, from where the DNA would be extracted and analysed. Given the volumes you have to process, the whole procedure can be fully automated. The lab machines can fit in a few large rooms scattered around the city, and the data would be sent to central supercomputers (probably the most expensive part). Bottlenecks are easily dealt with, the samples can be stored frozen for very long periods of time, and you actually need very little material to perform the actual experiment. Note that you cannot fool this method by just eating some meat before getting tested, you actually have to incorporate it in your diet to affect the bacteria population. You are actually testing the person's lifestyle, not their last meal. As a bonus, for the same cost, you can make a good sampling of the population's health and catch early most of the colon cancers and other gut diseases. (If you are interested in this approach, I can add more the details.) 

Another reason why it couldn't be is that one side could go total war beyond what it would be possible in the real world. For example, one could mobilize the full civilian population into the machine of war: all workshops and factories are reconverted to produce tanks, all food goes to the military, and every other able body is issued a gun and put in the front. This can easily overwhelm an enemy virtual army, but it cannot be done in real life because it would damage intensely the economy of the country; but since the war is virtual, every machine is kept, etc. Another problem is the scorched earth tactics taken to a superlative. You want my oil fields? I'll let your army get close, and then virtually nuke them. And every time you put boots on it, I'll nuke it again, until you give up, and I get them back, intact and productive. The same can be true for the attacker: nuke a enemy factory, wiping all defences, and take over the ruins. The intact factory and its production now belongs to you. The rules may prevent you from using it for this war, but nothing stops you from using it in the next one or during peace time. In real life, taking an industrial complex is much more risky if you want to also keep it functional. Finally, remember that winning a war is more about logistics than combat. You need to keep supply lines, produce equipment and ammunitions, provide food... and all this without taking so much damage that you'll collapse after the war. 

Why not do it "Ender's Game" style? For those of you who haven't read Ender's Game, it is a book about a brilliant child who eventually goes through a military school in which he plays "wargames." At first, the wargames are really just that: games, put in place to teach him commanding skills and tactics. But eventually, it in fact becomes him relaying orders to real armies invading an alien world. Thus, you would have each side get such a simulator, assemble a team of x geniuses (the number x would be predetermined) and have each side assigned a certain amount of forces of each kind. The battle thus begins in the simulators, with a digital arena created to avoid giving any side an advantage, or perhaps an asymmetric arena, but still with equal chances of winning. For example, you could have one side be the defending fleet of a planet, and the other the attacking fleet, with the ultimate goal of the attacking fleet to either capture the planet, which would mean deployment of ground troops on the planet and capturing of key capital cities, or the complete destruction of enemy forces. Each side would get 1 round attacking, 1 defending, and one planet vs planet, with each side having to simultaneously defend their planet and attack the opposing planet. Really, it would come down to this: which country has sufficient money to educate their geniuses. This would mean that certain poor countries wouldn't stand a chance; but this is the way it is already, anyway. Most countries would probably agree to this, as they would have no choice: refusing would both make them look like they are willing to throw away human life as well as effectively admitting that they are dumber as a country than their adversaries. 

Noninterference clause The gods are bound by a set of complex and mostly unknown god-rules. One of the primary rules is that a god cannot directly interfere with the chosen of other gods. The noble god interprets this rule much more strictly than the duplicitous god does. 

Unlikely, but it doesn't necessarily need to Existing spacecraft don't need to deal with relativistic speeds, but they still move incredibly fast. And while satellite-destroying meteors are rare, micrometeors are pretty common. A meter of shielding is far beyond the budgets of any spacecraft we currently build. Instead of trying to use thick solid shields, modern spacecraft rely on Whipple Shielding. A Whipple Shield is a spaced shield - it has two layers with a gap between them. The first layer intercepts obstacles, but it isn't intended to stop them - its purpose is to disperse the energy over a larger area. 

Even as the first layer gets perforated, the holes are small and don't significantly compromise the layer's structural integrity. The second layer isn't penetrated by the more diffuse impact, and maintains an airtight seal. There are, of course, many variations on the design that Fred Whipple proposed in 1946. You can use more than just two layers - that way if the energy is not sufficiently dispersed by the first impact, it can be dispersed several more times before risking your final layer. You can use flexible materials such as Kevlar instead of rigid aluminum. But the basic principles remain the same. By using multiple layers separated by gaps you disperse the impacting energy and make it possible to protect your ship with a great deal less shielding than you would need with a solid shield. 

This person legal status, for all practical purposes, will be pretty much like an illegal immigrant in your country. He has no papers, no official recognition; and he shouldn't make the authorities aware he is there. His only advantage is that his accent is probably indistinguishable from the locals, so people will likely think a priori that he is a citizen. Enrolling at the University is out of the question, as it requires ID and money. But that doesn't mean he cannot pretend to be a student, attend lectures, study on his own, and take on mini jobs targeted for college students. These are commonly unofficial, so he won't need documents nor leave a paper trail. Again, people won¡t think he is an illegal alien, so they won't get suspicious when he doesn't provide official papers. He won't be able to take exams, but he can make up a backstory saying he comes from a very poor family that cannot afford tuition (if there is such a thing in your country), but he is there for the knowledge. 

Proteins are the smallest machines of the cell that can do anything interesting (for some definition of interesting, but I work with proteins and I am biased). They are long chains of hundreds of aminoacids (thousands of atoms) do things like pumping water, nutrients, and waste in and out of the cells, guide chemical reactions, send signals, etc. One of the tools to study them are molecular dynamics simulations. They pretty much use classical mechanics (replacing the atoms with a fancy version of soft balls) with minor numerical tweaks to reproduce quantum behaviour to a very accurate degree. The tweaks are mostly to avoid having to solve the full electrostatic problem of where are the electrons at each time step; but nothing of that would seem strange to a microscopical individual. So, to get generally quantum-weird behaviour you have to go smaller than the basic functional unit of the life as we know it. 

This has already happened in history, though on a somewhat smaller scale. Consider this: before the age of the cargo airplane, travel speed was limited to the fastest truck or train. Because of that, the speed was 60 mph or so, tops. Then, the cargo plane arrived. ... Fast-forward to today. Now, flowers which die in 14 days after being plucked can be transported to a person's home in under 48 hours after being picked, regardless of the location of the farm and the destination. This has revolutionized the transport of perishable goods. Even today, companies like Amazon are making delivery faster and faster. In a few cities, for a high price, you can have 1 hr delivery. What would change? Not very much. All perishable goods would become cheaper, air travel would become nigh-obsolete, as a tunnel in the ocean would quickly be built. A whole new industry would develop: the acceleration seating industry. These trains need to accelerate, and assuming that they take 1 minute to get to top speeds, they would feel the equivalent of 3 times their weight pressing them back into their chair. Subway seats aren't going to fly. Deceleration will be a problem as well. Seat belts would need to be padded, or perhaps they would wear a special vest to distribute the weight evenly among their entire body. 

Defensive Teleportation A bomb can easily be teleported onto a ship, but the defending ship can just as easily teleport it off again. Ship teleportation systems are programmed to identify high energy reactions and teleport them as far away as possible. Unfortunately, this autonomous system only works because explosions have a 'loud' energy signature that the teleportation can lock on to. Human boarders cannot be as easily identified, and therefore have a chance to gain control of the ship without being spaced. 

You all are picking boring animals. Let's go look at the extinct list! I'd start with a glyptodont. It's basically a giant armadillo. It's strong but slow, and a quick shaman with a knife should be able to get past its armor without trouble. Now that you are invulnerable from the neck down, it's time for some strength. Bears are the obvious choice, but I think that they are probably outmatched by the 1,000 kg giant ground sloth. Now it's time to get some speed and endurance. Here the pronghorn is probably your best bet, if you can catch one. Sneaking up on one in the open plains where they live might be difficult, though, so you might turn instead to the majestic moose, which can clock in at 35 mph for over 500 m are excellent swimmers and can kick in every direction. For stealth and a wicked pouncing leap it's time to go jaguar hunting. And now you're ready to face your mammoth! 

It's a little bit of a crude solution, but it would work: remember what happens when you pour salt on a snail? In the same way, you just need to find a way to cause a large chemical unbalance on their planet. If they live in freshwater, then adding enormous amounts of sodium would dehydrate and kill them quickly. Of course, the planet is big, and so are the oceans, but locally, within a mile of the salt canister touching down and dissolving, all life would be gone. If its a saltwater planet, use something else. If humans are good at one thing, it's polluting oceans. Finally, humanity will put this to (arguably) good use. 

Likely, the magicians would do one of three things. Case 1) They all band together and become supreme dictators of the world. This shouldn't be too hard, seeing as they can create magical creatures and make super unlikely things happen. Case 2) They all band together to create world peace(cynics, feel free to skip this part). This also shouldn't be too hard, if they could combine their power to create some sort of spell that would cause every single weapon aimed at a human (or that would damage a human) to malfunction and turn into a raspberry pie. Case 3) WWW erupts(World War (between) Wizards). Eventually, either one will prevail or the world will be destroyed in the war. Seeing as the beings that we are talking about can effectively turn anything (or anyone) into pillars of salt, the world caught in the crossfire would likely be destroyed. Side note: depending on the amount of control the wizards in this scenario have over their magic, a spell gone awry could potentially destroy all of Earth and leave the magicians floating in empty space guiltily pointing at each other and saying "He did it" Now, the battlefield aspect. Friendly fire becomes a HUGE issue. Say the magician releases a spell saying something like "May all mine enemies turn to toads", but mispronounces and says "May all turn to toads". WAM and all of the soldiers on the battle field turn to toads. In the end, the magicians might be more trouble then they are worth. The battles will turn into two things: a) everyone protects the magician and b) everyone cowers from the firepower of the enemy magician. It's like bringing a nuclear silo to a knife fight.
