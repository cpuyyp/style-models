This way of forming the plural is common in Welsh nouns. It may be that this way of forming the plural is fairly common in other languages. Even if this form of pluralisation isn't all that rare, I'd still like to know what this kind of pluralisation is called? 

Well it's hard to tell when a language is 'born' because it often develops from another older language. I guess you could find a "date of birth" for a constructed language maybe. As for language death, well it could be when the last living speaker dies, taking the language with them. Another theory would be that a language dies when it's second last speaker does, because the last remaining speaker can not use that language with anyone, I.e. it is not a means of communication any more. If you wan to know more about language death then you should consult Crystal (2002) Language Death. 

I need to draw a dialect map, splitting an area up into differently coloured regions. Is there an online tool for creating dialect maps? Of course, any map drawing tool where I can take an existing map and draw lines, shade areas, label etc. would work fine 

I'll limit a few examples to the varieties of English found in the UK here. Northumbria There's a phenomenon known as the Northumbrian Burr in Northumbria in the North of England wereby (older) spreakers "typically pronounced as a voiced uvular fricative, often with accompanying lip-rounding ([ʁ(ʷ)])". The Survey of English Dialects 1950-61 even states that this is not only found in the syllable onset, but also maintained in the coda position (with any occurrence of /r/ being rare in British Englishes, other than Scottish varieties, South East, South West and part of Lancashire - e.g. Blackburn, Burnley). South Wales In my part of South Wales, itis not uncommon to hear older (and indeed younger), rural speakers pronounce /r/ as an uvular trill in both Welsh and English. I believe this is more common in the varieties of English spoken by bilingual (Welsh and English) speakers. As a small note, it should be worth mentioning that this is not something common in Welsh and that it would not be thought of as "standard". I know of older males who have this feature, but also younger speakers (my mother being of them) and even people I went to school with, now in their 20s. These are just two examples within the UK that I know of, but there are plenty of other nuances. 

Perhaps because words that begin with 'I' or 'V' in Latin are statistically more likely to use those as the semivowels /j/ and /w/, rather that the vowels /i/ and /u/ which are more common in the middle of words, eventually — but well after Roman times, and partly after the Middle Ages — 'J' and 'V' established themselves as semivocalic forms, while 'I' and 'U' remained for the vowels, and since the informal cursive distinction in "glyph length" became systematized as swashes in printing, this was no longer just restricted to handwriting. In the meanwhile, the phoneme /w/ had since long mutated into /β/ or /v/ in Latin and its successors, so 'V' is rarely used as a semivowel in today's languages that employ the Latin script, instead representing [v] or related fricatives or approximants. In some languages, /j/ stopped being a semivowel too, becoming [ʒ] in French for instance. So, the way 'V' and 'J' are used today varies with languages, and additionally, Germanic languages that still had a separate semivocalic /w/ created a convention of using a double 'U' or 'V' (which were not yet generally distinguished at that stage) to reduce the ambiguity with both /u/ and /v/. A tangentially related point is the origin of the dot on both 'i' and 'j' in modern non-capital scripts: this can be traced back to the apex diacritic mentioned above, which eventually became the acute accent used in many modern languages to mark either word stress or vowel quality resulting from ancestral length distinction, although some languages still use it to mark length. Because 'ı' and 'ȷ' were thin letters which often caused confusion (especially with 'm' when they were next to 'n') in minuscule handwriting, the apex or acute accent, then known as a tittle, started being systematically used regardless of length, quality or stress, merely to make those letters stand out as separate from the adjoining ones. 

Well Papua New Guinea famously has a lot of languages - 830 languages at the last count (and that's languages, not dialects!) However, I'm not sure about how different these languages are, but the numbers are huge and do come from a few different backgrounds. For example, English and Hiri Motu are pretty different languages. If you take the land mass of PNG (452,860 km sq) and divide by the number of languages, according to ethnologue (830) you get a figure of approximately 546 km squared per language. The figure for Vanuatu would be approx. 107 km sp per language, indicating a higher density, but whether or not these languages vary as much as those of PNG, you'd have to consult the link given in jlovegren's answer. 

Fillers are used in many languages when the speaker signals that he or she is thinking but has not yet finished talking. Things in English like umm, er, uh etc. Is there something that can be put in the interlinear gloss to convey this? Something like FILL, or a similar abbreviation? 

You probably want to check out the book Armenian loanwords in Turkish by Robert Dankoff. He lists azap 'torment', deri 'leather' and zekrek etc. as examples of Armenian words in Turkish. 

Many nouns in Welsh have a the plural form that is shorter than the singular form (i.e. the singular form looks like the plural form + affix). For example: Singular 

In certain papers on Optimality Theory (e.g. this paper by McCarthy, or this) the tableaus contain the notations *L and *W, as seen in the image below: 

As to your child, I guess that to someone who is just learning to count, the similarity in the initial sound may be enough to get confused and skip one. After all, the initial sound is the strongest intuitive indicator of similarity between words to our brain. 

It tends to depend on the history on the name itself, not "historical importance" of the city per se, although it is definitely plausible that, generally speaking, cities with a more complicated naming history that spans various languages and civilization are in fact more important. There are no hard and fast "rules" at all, but I can provide some examples of things that have happened. 

However, saying it was "spelled with an I instead of a J" may be misleading, because 'J' as a later innovation did not arise from thin air: while 'I' and 'J' were not distinguished in Roman times, they existed as graphically distinct variants of the same letter, which always looked more like 'I' in capitals, but could sometimes look more like a (dotless) 'ȷ' in everyday cursive script. The distinction was originally just a matter of natural variation within people's handwriting, but in time, a habit tended to form where the first and/or last letters in a word may come to stand out more, resulting in 'ȷ' being used more often than 'ı' in those contexts, just like a better-defined 'v' would stand out more than a more fluidly-written 'u'. I think this pattern can be observed in a few of the Vindolanda tablets for example. I consider it somewhat natural for the first bit of handwriting to be written more carefully or incisively than what follows. In the case of 'ȷ' (often called the equivalent of "long I" in several modern languages), the distinction may also have been influenced by the standardized classical Roman habit of writing a longer 'I' to indicate that it was a long vowel, something they routinely did in inscription too, and which was unique to 'I' as the same indication was given for other vowel letters by writing an apex above them, at least when useful to reduce ambiguity. This use, in any case, is distinct from the specific shape and use that 'J' later evolved into. Another letter that often underwent shape/length changes depending on position in Roman cursive was 's', and this distinction also survived into modern times as the long ſ, this time used within words whereas 's' would be used at the extremities. Since this also appears in Caesar's name in both word positions, we can reconstruct the way his name would typically have been written in Roman cursive by approximating it, at least in concept, with the modern lowercase form 

With some help from Rocío, I have found a fairly useful resource (in the bibliography of Greenberg). The reference in question is Pavle Ivić (1958) Die serbokroatischen Dialekte:ihre Struktur und Entwicklung, Volume 1. It can be found on Google Books, but it's not available for preview. However, you might find a copy at a library, I have. 

Where can I find a copy of Paul Kiparsky's How abstract is phonology? written in 1968? The only place version I've found so far is a snippet view on Google Books and this summary. 

Optimality Theory has been adapted by some linguists to a stratified model, what are the benefits of such a model over a non-stratified model of OT? 

Catalan has a process whereby word-final non-continuants undergo deletion and nasal assimilation. For example /ben+k/ surfaces as [beŋ] 'I sell'. Why is this relation opaque? Note: I found this question in some lecture notes from 2011 and can't find the answer. 

Wikipedia suggests that Japanese is such a language. For example the pronoun watashi "I" becomes watashi-tachi "we" 

What is meant by these notations? The second paper I linked to used these examples if you want to see the kinds of contexts they're used in. 

So in non-rhotic varieties, these forms become Del, Sal/Sally, Harry/Hal/Hap to avoid the coda-position /r/. So is the change from /r/ in the cases of Robert and Richard, where /r/ is in a syllable onset, the subject of some phonological change or something different (e.g. Etymology). 

There is very little doubt they were pronounced: they are still pronounced in many languages other than English where they were loaned, and crucially in modern Greek; they were also spelled with those clusters when coeval Latin borrowed them. The fact you cannot pronounce them doesn't mean they cannot be pronounced... No offense, but everyone's pronunciation abilities tend to be limited by their native language's phonology (which sounds are found and distinguished in the language) and phonotactics (which combinations of sounds are allowable in which situations). Foreign sounds, or combinations of sounds, can be hard to produce without training. To hear how these sounds are pronounced in practice, you can just open Google Translate and click on the speaker icon to make it pronounce words of this sort in modern Greek, Italian (this one has an obvious schwa in "xenofobia", but I can testify that's a glitch in the speech synthesizer, as in standard Italian there is no schwa there), Spanish, Swedish or German. I have also recorded myself pronouncing some words starting with this kind of clusters in Italian: psicologo, pseudonimo, pneumatico, pneumotorace, xilofono, xenofobo, just to have them from an actual human speaker too. 

From the point of view of Japanese, I find it strange that they would be perceived as very similar. I mean, of course they have a couple of things in common, namely /s/ and two vowels. But while Japanese transcription of foreign words can be rather quirky, due to the very constrained phonotactics of the Japanese language (which is mostly restricted to a CV, i.e. consonant followed by vowel, structure, with exceptions), these two words would sound different when transposed into Japanese phonology:

Speech often (always?) deteriorates for people with post-lingual deafness. This presumably occurs because of insufficient auditory feedback. Given that people with Wernicke's aphasia cannot comprehend language, do they also experience speech deterioration (that is, speech becoming disjointed and/or ungrammatical) over time as a result of hearing themselves speak, but not understanding the sounds they produce? 

I'm working on a paper on the history of computational phonology. As I understand it, Chomsky & Halle's SPE acted as a catalyst for research in the field, namely by laying the foundations for two-level models and POS taggers. Fraser and Bobrow designed the first phonological rule-testing system the same year (1968). The introduction of automata in phonological rule systems by Kaplan and Kay, years later, seems to be a turning point. Prince and Smolensky's Optimality Theory in the mid 90's as well. What are other important papers / innovations in computational phonology? I am still doing research, but your input is most welcome. This is my list so far: 

Is there a phonological reason for this change? I know there are names where, when clipped, there is /r/ in coda position. For example: 

English Grammar and Syntax defines the two as follows: Grammar is a set of rules that set forth the correct standard of usage in a language. These rules dictate how we should say things correctly. For example, agreement between words in relation to other constructions in the sentence. Syntax is the study of sentences and their structure, and the constructions within sentences. Syntax tells us what goes where in a sentence. 

The verb in a language like English can inflect for person, for example: I see the cat > he sees the cat and the verb can inflect for tense: I see the cat > I saw the cat But do any languages inflect for the singular/plural aspect of the object? i.e. is there a language where the verb 'to see' would be different in the two contexts 'I see the cat' and `I see the cats' 

So how is it so that these loanwords attain the tone pattern that they do? Is there some kind of pattern? 

This Basque etymological dictionary claims that the word is "of unknown origin", but that the variant forms (h)uri and iri have been recorded in toponymy of Rioja, Alava and Navarro (Basque-speaking regions) from the 11th Century onwards. This would suggest that they are of Basque origin (and would rule out your theory of incorporation through the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia - as the forms were recorded in the region prior to the existence of the kingdom)
