So some sort of compress chamber will be needed, to compress the plasma to a equal pressure as the ambient, to increase the range. Even with this I can't imagine a long range or a concentrated shot for this weapon, lets say 20 m. The result would be more like slugs in a shotgun than a laser-like bolter. Compress much more the plasma wouldn't work, because the expansion forces are proportional to the difference of pressures. A optimal balance point between pressure and burst speed need to be calculated to maximize the range and/or effect, so the gun must have a computer and these controllers. 

By definition Plasma is a state of super excitement of mater and can be described as a super hot gas. Well, the main problem is how to make a burst of plasma, normally many times less dense than the air, cross a significant rang of atmosphere. Let say, 100 m. As the burst exits the gun the gas start to: 

This is the part that I doubt. The outer (liquid) core is made of iron and nickel. Pumping a liquid metal against gravity isn't going to work. 

That makes no sense. A celestial object (say a stable star) would be very useful for determining units of mass and/or units of luminosity. It would allow standardisation over vast distances. However the mass of a star has no relationship to the value of currency - it is just a constant. Value is measured in terms of supply and demand (diamonds are rare and highly valued). Equating mass to value is like equating apples to headaches - they have nothing in common. Edit in response to comment Mass in itself has no value. Scenario 1. I walk into a bar in a gold-mining community. 

The points in your map (cities, towns and villages) are hierarchical, so the road patter must respect this hierarchy. A point wants to communicate with a greater one, not a equal. This hierarchy also reflect the point dispersion. The road itself also make points. A important and long road must have inns, rest points, that with time develop into villages.There is also a demographic spot along the road we can see in satellite photos of forest roads. Other important factor is water. You can't built a city without water to drink and to plant. If the city became too big, like Roma you will need a logistic solution, like importing a lot of wheat (and fighting wars for arable land) and building aqueducts. There are physical, economical and historic reasons to a city became big and important, but always remember that the road system is hierarchical as the points it link. So, the probability for two near but small villages to have a direct connection is smaller than these villages to have a direct connection with a bigger city in near. This is the "most efficient network"? For most of the travels yes, but is very sub optimal to do all possible travels. Travel is a risk, even today and this is a factor against giving a chance to Big Bad Wolf in lonely roads. So: 

Third Person doctor/helper is a non-biological Person (Robot), or a sapient non-mammal, or a human with a very serious blood bourne infection, or some blood toxicity Thing. All very good reasons not to use their own blood 

"a species has the psychological effects of alcohol"??? Question is somewhat unclear. Do you mean a species of which every individual, all the time, experiences the symptoms that humans get from alcohol intoxication? How can you even measure that? Human alcohol intoxication effents are only defined by Deviation from how unintoxicated human Brains work. A species whose Brains are inherently wired in such a way that they can never function better than humans at the alcohol Level you mentioned, would be somewhat less likely to survive or have evolved. Or, the other way, a species that somehow(?) has effects of alcohol, would have evolved to inherently, by how their Brains are wired, have superhuman concentration, Inhibition, reasoning, depth perception, what have you, so they would always compensate and have competitive abilities like humans 

Our world is a simulation; it is part of an exhibition in a science museum in an alien dimension. Lately, visitors to the museum have become bored with the exploits of the inhabitants of the sim. It costs money to run and attendance has fallen. The museum's director is seriously thinking of pulling the plug. The problems All we do, as members of this sim, is (a) procreate (b) make media that is either trashy or about the sim we live in. (c) argue about religion (d) make war (e) Invent technology that is far behind that of the alien race that visits the museum to see us Question What can the human race do that is different from what we have always done and that will make us a viable exhibit once more and prevent ourselves being switched off and replaced by something more interesting? 

Human Breasts. Because it is very implausible for a newborn whose spine is curved in the way that a centaur's must be, and who can't possibly have more developed Motor skills than that prime example of mammalian precocialness that is a horse foal, to bend down /curl around to reach the udder. Assuming the centaur Baby is the same size in relation to the mother, as a horse foal, the Standing offspring would not quite reach the nipples at birth and either require the mother to kneel, or use a Kind of step stool. And then they would be tall enough to comfortably reach the breast after a few weeks, and would know when to wean when they grow so tall they would have to bend down... again with the spine Also, suckling from the upper Body is just cuddly and nice and allows for eye contact and hugs, so I feel that would be more appropriate for a species that has both eyes in front and participates in somewhat human-like social interactions (If that's what you're going for). 

Land The problem would come if the creature cannot be loose inside the shell. Propulsion could be achieved by changing the centre of gravity - perhaps by moving water around in a special vesicle. Water Spherical shells would be terrible on water. We've all seen those plastic balls with people inside going absolutely nowhere. If they are underwater however then there are definite possibilities. 

In fact almost any muscle movement affects circulation somewhat. When you are walking or running, your legs aid your heart enormously by their pumping effect. 

This goes more than twice as deep as the tallest building is high. Whether anyone would want to live there with journeys of up to an hour to reach the surface, is another matter. 

the fact is we have in Brazil a almost atheist indigenous people, so there is no strong law enforcing religion for primitive societies: Pirah√£ people note they are in stone age, not bronze age. But the religion plays a role in the development of civilization. Without religion would be necessary another form of central ideological power, and maybe these is mandatory. Also, religions can vary a lot. Sumerians don't believed in afterlife, a essential component in nowadays religions. Romans have many lares, deities without form or appearance. 

Think in the people. Why they live in each point? Why some points became important (big)? Link important points, distribute smaller points around the bigger ones and across the most important roads. Link the new points to cities, thinking in the point hierarchy and "why a citizen of this point want to go to this other point?" but also to points in roads, or crossroads. Many cities birth this way. Select some of this new points to grow, and repeat until you like your map. 

The biggest problem will be chromosomes. Do the two species have the same number/size chromosomes? How are the genes distributed across those chromosomes? It is going to be impossible to select for this. It would require monumental strokes of luck at regular intervals. Rather like the balls coming out of the pockets of a snooker table and forming themselves into a perfect triangle. Probably the only way to do this would be to evolve them both backwards until you reached a common ancestor. This would require you to know the entire genome of the ancestor and evolve backwards to it one step at a time. Very expensive, very time consuming and completely pointless. 

This is a non-magical, non hi-tech world. It could perhaps be crime fiction, romance or adventure but nothing too way out. The book has to have a happy ending with you as the good guy/gal. You can do evil things to achieve that but the author mustn't know about it or even suspect. You can't simply murder the current hero because then you would become a baddy. The author would have to get someone else to track you down and kill you. That person would become the hero instead of you. You cannot step out of the story and influence the real world directly. Your influence must occur within the action of the story itself. If you decide to travel, you can only go to places that the author has heard of. Be careful because he/she might only have a vague idea of what the place is like. There might be blank areas. Similarly with the author's knowledge of technology. You might try to repair your car and find a vague, meaningless lump of metal under the hood/bonnet. 

Okay but when you assume the same athmospheric composition, and therefore also mass of any given quantity of air, you can't just say "gravity is such, AND/BUT air pressure is such", you have to calculate air pressure (at any given height) from gravity, because it is dependent on how much air is above it in the athmosphere, which in turn is dependent on how much air the planet can hold by ist mass/gravity. Sorry, I can't seem to find how to do that just this Moment, (which is why I can't even tell if that 1/3 - 1/2 Thing you started with is maybe correct), but I'm quite sure that is how it works. Unless you factor in Magic/some weird substance or structure that stably exists in the upper athmosphere/a mechanism by which gravity affects gases differently than solids...
