There's not really a science to tread pattern the way you're hoping for. Sure, there are some basics that you've already caught on to. But there are many, perhaps infinitely many, variables involved in how a tire will handle once you get it into the real world. Yes, most of the wording on a brand's web site is just marketing speak. Even so, you're better off just trusting what the manufacturer recommends the tire be used for ( downhill cx/ wet/mud/gravel etc ) rather than spending so much time picking apart the details. To make things easier on yourself, find someone you know that's done this before or ask this site for a recommended and reliable brand. Once you've got a brand you can trust, use their web site to narrow down your selection and just give some tires a try. You've got to start somewhere. 

Many first time cross racers use a mountain bike. It makes perfect sense, don't go out and spend $1500+ before you even know whether cyclocross is your cup of tea. Most all races allow mountain bikes, the only type of equipment that's usually forbidden is a fixed gear. A full suspension mountain bike will do just fine as an introductory race vehicle. Your primary setback is that it's heavier than a cross bike, so it will slow you down when carrying it up a steep incline, or carrying it over the barriers, etc. But, those beefy ( and heavy ) tires might carry you through the mud quite nicely, maybe even putting you at somewhat of an advantage in a muddy beginners race. Just be friendly and courteous out on the course, cyclocross is about having fun. 

My grandpa gave me his old 1974 Raleigh International (all original Campy) as a graduation present. Since the stock wheels are for tubular tires, and I do want to ride it around town, I want to get wheels for clincher tires so I can change the inner tube when I flat rather than having to mess with glue jobs. A new rear wheel means that I can have an option of getting a rear wheel with shimano hyperglide so I can choose modern cassettes. Because the shifters are friction shifters rather than indexed shifters, does it matter how many cogs are in the cassette? Do I have to stick with 5 or could I even go to 10? I stand corrected that the frame is steel and not alumninum. I was mistaken because the bike is significantly lighter than other steel-framed bikes I have dealt with. I apologize for this error. 

The 2000 miles is an estimate of when the chain will stretch. Your chain may last longer than that. As far as replacing it goes, I think it depends on your financial situation. If you can easily afford a new chain, I recommend buying one. A replaced chain means that you don't have to worry about your current chain stretching beyond the limit and damaging your bike. If your budget makes buying a new chain difficult, you'll be all right to keep riding. Just check the chain stretch every so often to determine when it's getting near absolutely necessary to buy a chain. 

For about the last year, I've had a problem keeping my bike on the road. Originally, my rear tube went flat when the tire was punctured by an office staple (don't ask me how a regular office staple could have been positioned properly on the road and puncture all the way through the tire while I was riding, I can't figure that out either). Since then, every time I replace the tube, it lasts for maybe two weeks and then goes flat again. Each time, the tube gets this mysterious slice along the inner side. Here is a picture of one of these slices. It's very faint; only deep enough to puncture fully through the tube in a few places. 

This is a picture of the inner side of the tube. The slice is almost halfway down from the seam and runs across the length of the tube shown here. My patch is covering the largest hole, but doesn't solve the problem. The first time I saw this, I figured it was something to do with the rim. However, this slice (which is usually about 20cm long) appears in different locations relative to the valve on every new tube. So if it is something to do with the rim, it isn't anything that would be in a fixed location on the rim. I also thought it could be due to installation error, so I made sure a few times I had professionals at the shop do the installing. Same thing; about two weeks later it would be flat with a slice like this through it. Obviously, this has nothing to do with the tire itself, since no part of the tire is in contact with this part of the tube. Given the time it takes to form, it looks like something is gradually cutting into the tube and, after about two weeks, finally manages to wear through it. I've washed the rim thoroughly and run my fingers along it to check for slivers. Nothing. I thought maybe it was the rim strip, the edge of which contacts the tube. That's still my number 1 guess, but if that's it, why is this slice only along a ~20cm section of the tube (I've checked the rest, no slice) and always in a different place along the rim? Why wouldn't it either be in the same place or along the entire tube if it were the strip? Anyway, this mystery has me stumped and has cost me a fortune in tubes and bus fare (what with a bike no longer being my commute option). To try to mitigate it, I've tried using self-sealing tubes, which obviously didn't work perfectly (lasted an extra few days though) because they are more suited for punctures on the outer side of the tube. My next thought is trying puncture-proof tubes. If I can't figure out how to stop these slices, I figure puncture-proof tubes would be thick enough to give me a few extra weeks per tube. For the record, the bike is a Trek 3700 with 26X2 wheels and I usually pump the rear wheel up to about 45-50 psi. TL;DR: What's causing these slices in my tubes? How can I prevent it? 

I think if you are willing to spend a few hours, it's worth doing yourself. Depending on the flange size of the new hub, though, you may need to buy new spokes. You can determine the length of the spokes you will need using a spoke length calculator. You will need a spoke wrench, a flat-head screwdriver, some vaseline, and the use of a truing stand. Here's what you'll have to do: 

I have found grip shifts to have more problems over time than trigger shifters. If you plan on riding this particular bike for several years, I recommend swapping out the revoshift in favor of comparably priced shimano trigger shifters. Since you are even considering taking apart the shifter, I believe you will be able to install new shifters, cables and housing. Remember that new cables will stretch quickly, so if you choose to change shifters, be prepared to adjust the cable lengths after the first couple rides. If you would like to fix the shifter you have, make sure to take a picture of the shifter mechanism when you open it up before starting to work on it. Then make an outline of what you see on a piece of paper and tape to it the screws you remove in their respective locations. Make new such outlines for each level of shifter as you remove more pieces. This way you can avoid losing tiny screws and springs and other pieces and you will know what goes where when you try to reassemble the shifter. 

I'm going to attack this backwards. First of all, camping is the only way you won't have to worry all day about where you're going to sleep. Provided you don't take a route through inhospitable areas, the beauty of planning to camp is in most areas down there, you can pull over, a good distance from the road, and set up camp. It will probably be cold at night, and yes you'll need a low temperature sleeping bag to stay comfortable. Inevitably, you'll meet people who invite you to sleep on their couch. It's a welcome change of pace from camping every day. But it's much easier to plan to camp and be pleasantly surprised with a night on the couch than to plan on couch surfing and be caught camping without enough supplies. As for the bike. I will say: make sure it fits wide tires. I'd say 30mm minimum. You really need to do your research if you're going to buy the bike used. A friend of mine bought a bike for a trip similar to yours. He was given some bad advice and the bike ended up being so poorly equipped for the ride that he had to sell it and buy a new one halfway through the ride. Ironically, it was a shop mechanic that completely misunderstood his needs and steered in the wrong direction, towards a bike that had skinny tires and wasn't upright enough. So you can't always trust your local bike shop, unfortunately. Cough up the money for a used book or two on the subject and educate yourself. It's up to you to hit the road with the right equipment, and the right equipment can mean the difference between a good trip and a horrible experience. 

Always be careful about carbon fiber and collisions. Carbon fiber is light and strong, but it's very fragile and can break unexpectedly because you can't always see the cracks. In one of my collegiate mtb short track races, a guy snapped his carbon fiber handlebar at the stem after a 1' drop because the handlebar took abuse over time. When it lost all strength, the effect on the equipment was catastrophic. So in your case, if the crash was strong enough to throw you over the hood of the car to the other side, it probably messed up the carbon fork, even if you can't see it. When riding bikes, I've found the fork to be particularly useful, so certainly have the fork checked out, but be prepared to junk it for your own safety. 

There is one other aspect that has not yet been addressed: shifters. Shimano and SRAM use different technologies for the rear derailleur. Most SRAM has a 1:1 actuation ratio, which means that the length of cable moved by the shifters is identical to the horizontal movement of the derailleur. However, all Shimano uses a 2:1 actuation ratio, which means that twice as much cable has to be moved as horizontal movement of the derailleur. If you have Shimano shifters, you must get a Shimano rear derailleur. But if you have SRAM shifters that are X-series (X-4, X-5, X-7, X-9, X-0), you must get a SRAM rear derailleur. This is a concern only for the rear derailleur and not for the front derailleur. 

What type of pedal are you using? You're a relatively tall guy for a 55 cm bike. You're almost my height, I think you would be much more comfortable on a frame that's closer to 59 cm. 

Cyclocross bikes value a different set of priorities than road bikes. You want your cyclocross bike to have wide grippy tires so that you have good traction in all of that mud. You also want more clearance around your stays so that said mud doesn't build up too much there. You also want to have a wider wheel base and more clearance for easier maneuvering through the courses. Road bikes aren't strictly lighter, a carbon fiber cx bike might easily be lighter than some aluminum road bikes. But yes, in general you want to lose as much weight as you can if you're going to be racing that road bike up all of those enormous hills. With all of that maneuvering, another great feature on a lot of cross bikes are the cheater breaks 

It's hard to tell from the photo ( is that large vertical streak said crack? ), but if your frame is cracked, don't use it. Riding on a cracked frame is risky as it could result in a catastrophic failure / injury / death. It looks like that's probably a steel frame, so find a local frame builder ( not your buddy who's handy with a welder ), and depending on the damage they may be able to repair it for you.
