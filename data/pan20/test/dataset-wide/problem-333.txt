With regard to accuracy, it's completely impractical. 1. You haven't stated what orbit he is in. If it is not geostationary then it will end up dragging over sea and land. 2. If he is in geostationary orbit then he must be above the equator. You can't have a geostationary orbit above the poles. 3. If he is above the equator, he has a real problem. The line has to be ultra light-weight. Unfortunately this means it can easily be blown around by air currents as he lowers it. At the equator the air flow at the upper layers of the atmosphere diverges towards the poles. The fishing line might never touch water or, if it did, the place would be very difficult to predict. 

Well, having seen the very useful answers of others, an idea has just occurred to me. Surely the centaur farrier could use long-handled tools in conjunction with a mirror. The only problem about this, is making a hammer that can work around corners. I think that the drilling and stomping idea that has been put forward is possible. In these days, all sorts of electronic and electrical devices could be designed, as well as using a personalised jig for each hoof. Even hand-driven tools that were floor-mounted would have been possible in pre-industrial times with the necessary ingenuity. 

As we all know, terrorism, by its very nature is difficult to combat. A certain famous stage hypnotist uses the following trick when performing. He puts the whole audience in a trance at the start of the show. He hypnotises them to believe they have had a wonderful time and to tell their friends how great it was. In fact there is no show. He eats his dinner, reads the newspaper and watches a bit of TV. Finally he wakes them up and they go home talking excitedly about what they've seen. There is a war on terror and the government want to use the hypnotist to help them win. How can our hypnotist modify/refactor his skills to successfully wage war on the terrorists? 

Question What can a pre-industrial people make of this picture? Clearly it is of great significance. How can a primitive society comprehend or explain what they see? 

Because you are a minor character, you have more freedom to act behind the scenes than the hero or heroine. Would you be able to tell who the main characters were, just by their behaviour and what happened to them? Is it safe to try and communicate with the author or is it better to lie low and hope s/he doesn't kill you off? In any case, how could you attract the attention of the author without behaving in such a way that you would be written out as irrelevant or destructive to the story-line? While the author is busy with the main characters, would it be possible to convince other minor characters that, like you, they were fictional and perhaps start a riot or somehow interfere with the author's intentions in a significant way? Main question Can you suggest long-term strategies to - Get yourself promoted to be an important character of the book. This means that your life will be much more interesting and you will have access to resources that you otherwise might not. Maybe you can even become the hero. [This has been edited to reduce appearance of referring to a single character.] NOTES 

It depends how alien the aliens are. For example, supposing they are utterly logical and have an enormous short-term memory. Then they could use something akin to some computer or mathematical constructs. For example: 

Don't fall asleep. They may kill you and steal the artefacts believing they can use them without your help. Beware of customs. If you are a man, you may have to return to their camp and marry the chief's daughter - and prove your ... erm ... abilities. If you are a woman you may find a whole hunting party of Neanderthals somewhat daunting, especially if they have been away from their women-folk for some time. Keep that ray-gun handy. 

BOUNTY I'm planning to put a sizable bounty on this question. I'll do it when all the bugs have been ironed out. Please feel free to give comments in the meantime to clarify the rules. When I do award the bounty I'll make sure all the rules and all parts of the question are clear in my question. If you want to give answers now, please feel free. You can always add another answer later or edit your answer. I'll give the rules for awarding the bounty later when I've decided how best to do it. (I haven't given one before.) 

How soon can we get there? First write your software (!). Then write a virus that takes over the whole internet. You would probably have enough computing power right there but it would soon be shut down. What would be the electric bill? Almost zero for you if you did the above. The world-wide bill would be exactly the same as it is now, but you wouldn't be paying it. Moving on ... How small can we make it? Clearly, if we use biotechnology we can make it as small as the human brain. In fact, because we are designing it to be small, we could use nano-circuits and make it even smaller. How fast can we make it? Neurons are pretty inefficient when it comes to speed. By removing all the extra junk that came along with evolution, we could make it a lot faster than a natural brain. 

I think people would soon get into the habit of praying repeatedly all through the day. Example Please ensure that the bus I am currently boarding reaches my desired bus-stop on schedule, with me in it and in good health. Then when you get near the bus-stop: Please ensure that I am able to get off the bus without doing damage to myself or others. etc. The fact that I personally may have left some loopholes in my examples above is because I am a stranger in this world. This would be taken care of in the actual world because natural selection would eliminate people who couldn't formulate good prayers. 

It's an old joke but how would it actually affect the food chain and our everyday lives? Note There are other threads about flying animals and characters but I haven't found one that deals with the specific issues of their effect on human society. Additionally these are super-pigs which is also different. Assumptions Pigs fly by the same method as Superman (whatever that is). Pigs are super-beings to the same extent that Superman is. They have X-ray vision when needed and their skin will stop bullets, etc. They are not as intelligent as people so they don't use their abilities as well as Superman does. They only have normal pig intelligence. We do not have Superman or Kryptonite to protect us. If you like there may be very limited amounts of Kryptonite available but the entire world supply is only sufficient to weaken a dozen pigs at most and pigs are everywhere. Pigs eat more or less what they do now. They are omnivores. Also they need to eat just like normal pigs. EDIT to be more specific about Superman's powers. It would be impractical to post all the superpowers here. I therefore refer you to the following site. Powers and abilities of Superman If there is any conflict then I prefer powers that he had from the 1978 Christopher Reeve movies or later. As mentioned, they don't have super intelligence. 

There are no eyeholes allowed and the police (who are exempted whilst on duty) check at regular intervals. The boxes are of a standard size and have to be worn level as shown in the photo. They are sold with special internal headgear that ensures this. People can see a limited amount of the ground, so signposts etc. are painted on the floor. People never see the faces of anyone they have never met at home. There are some illegal establishments that have mirrors on the floor but the penalties for attending these are very severe. Mirrors are banned in all public places. It would be impossible to police inside everyone's home. Friends can take off their boxes in each others homes. Any suspicion that this is being done for profit or to promote discontent or boxless 'orgies' will lead to police raids and severe penalties. Be careful if you have more than a couple of guests at a time. UPDATE The dictator is very repressive. He has now banned all cameras of any kind unless they are government approved and used by the national newspaper or the national broadcasting system. Of course there may be a black market in cameras. The internet is heavily censored but it exists and tech-savvy people can view non-box and pre-box material. This is not approved but very difficult to prevent. Just don't be caught with any of it on your hard-disk. Because cameras are illegal it is very difficult and risky to make video material of any kind. Question How would this restriction affect: 

Very risky - especially if you eat the brains. This was the main cause of the 'mad cow disease' epidemic. Firstly cattle were being fed with the remains of deceased cattle. Secondly this spread to humans. The main risk is from nervous tissue - brain and spinal cord. These are now prohibited from the food chain in most first-world countries. 

A species on such a planet would not be giants. Large creatures would be crushed by gravity. In fact they would have to be very small - maybe insect-like. If they have any ability to fly in their atmosphere, which presumably is quite dense, maybe we could catch them in nets from orbit and reel them in. In any case, our space-craft will be enormous compared to anything they could construct. We could perhaps let a weighted thread down to the surface with a hook. They could attach an escape-pod that contains a few of them together with their food and air. Then we haul them in. 

If magic has immutable laws then it is science and can be studied as such. The equivalent of Isaac Newton would come along and start to sort it all out. If you doubt this then note that Newton was an advocate of alchemy. 

The melting point of iron is 1,538 Â°C. If you could pump it, as soon as it reached the mantle it would solidify and block the pipes. 3. Let's say you overcame these obstacles. Then your technology must be such that you could avoid doing any damage to the environment. You would probably end up with a huge lake of solid iron/nickel. Edit - As Toby Y. has pointed out, if it got very big it would just sink through the Earth's crust, through the magma and then probably back into the core. 

Please see edit made to avoid closure due to opinion. There is a genre of logic puzzles whose solution depends on truth tellers and liars, e.g. 

The best strategy would be to make everything easily explicable by science. Maybe the laws of science would be much more obvious than our own. Instead of having relativity, God could base the universe on Newton's Laws. He could leave a really good fossil record with no missing links. This would encourage people to believe in evolution. If it is too late for the above then God could start giving good luck to atheists and bad luck to believers. Not so much difference as to be noticeable but enough so that atheists tend to positions of power and privilege and can therefore spread their ideas on religion more easily. 

... All you have to do is go into a suspended animation state instead of sleep (this would be like hibernation). The rest of the time you would just have to keep on the move - the faster you run, the faster you can run. I think this lifestyle would suit predators best. Lion-like (or cheetah-like) creatures could spend 95% of their day sleeping, then a quick warm-up before chasing the bejesus out of everything in sight. Fill your stomach and then straight back to sleep. The enzymes will continue to work even though you are not running around. Whilst resting, your stomach muscles could produce a slow, blood-pumping action whilst you digested your food. 

Let's assume that Alice and Bob are of different stature. Bob being who he is would not date a girl taller than him so we can assume he is the taller (but it doesn't really matter who is taller). For the sake of argument we'll say that Alice has shorter legs. When she drives she has the seat adjusted way forward. There is a switch under the seat that detects its position and forms part of the ignition circuit. When Bob wants to drive he has to push the seat back or suffer crushing his knees against the bulkhead. That disconnects the ignition and the car won't start. If Alice is taller then she makes it so Bob cannot reach the pedals without moving the seat forward -- again disconnecting the ignition.
