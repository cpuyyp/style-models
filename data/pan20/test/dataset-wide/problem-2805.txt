This is a common story about insanity, but it is false. Consider some of the cases in which a person has been involuntarily committed, such as john Hinckley who tried to assassinate Reagan. Was Hinckley incapable of acting on his preferences? No. Hinckley wanted to kill Reagan and tried to do so. The problem is not he lacked agency, but that he used his agency in a way people don't like. The same is true of other people deemed insane. The point of classifying a person insane is to make it possible to do stuff to that person against his will without a trial. People are not classified as insane because they have no reason for their actions, but because nobody wants to understand their reasons. Just to be clear, I am not saying that people deemed insane are all good or just misunderstood or anything like that. Some of them may be very bad. Hinckley attempted to murder somebody, which is a bad thing to do. But the idea that such people lack agency for actions that are clearly deliberate is a disgraceful obfuscation. As such, the fact that some people are deemed to be insane doesn't pose much of a problem for compatibilism if people properly identify what's going on with such labels. If people are unwilling to clearly discuss such issues, then they will be confused.

My answer is going to cover Objectivism, which not sufficiently explained above, and point out some problems with what you have written that weren't picked up in other answers. Objectivism, as explained by Ayn Rand, provides a secular moral philosophy that answers your questions. Objectivism claims that morality is a set of values that should "guide manâ€™s choices and actions". You say: 

You missed Popper who pointed this out in 1934 in "Logic of Scientific Discovery". I think the relevant chapter is Chapter V. And Popper is better on this issue than Quine, Feyerabend and Kuhn. I'm not going to say anything about the specific examples you cite, but rather consider only the general issues involved in discussion. The fact that observation is theory laden does not imply that disagreements are unresolvable. Some explanations are not compatible with facts, logic, laws of physics and so on. The appropriate way to approach discussion with anyone, including people your disagree with, is to follow this motto: "I may be wrong and you may be right, and by an effort, we may get nearer to the truth". You should do this partly because it is hard to discuss ideas you're not willing to entertain and partly because you may actually by wrong, even about ideas you think are obvious. In fact, you are often most in danger of being wrong about anything you think is obvious. People with whom you have very large disagreements have very different assumptions and ideas, but this does not make discussion impossible or unrewarding if you are genuinely willing to take their ideas seriously. This doesn't mean agreement. It means considering those ideas and their implications critically. It also means treating your own ideas critically. For further explanation see the title essay in Popper's book "The Myth of the Framework" and www.fallibleideas.com/paths-forward. One further note. It is very common for people on both sides of some debate to be wrong. It is currently especially common for both sides of a debate to claim the "authority of science" when talking about a subject that has very little to do with science, such as political economy or morality. You should be on the lookout for this tendency in your own ideas and in the ideas of the people you are debating. Science has no authority. Science consists of guessing solutions to problems, that's flaws in current ideas, and critically discussing guesses. Anyone who cites the authority of science is either ignorant of philosophy or intellectually and morally unserious, and this should be pointed out plainly. 

Physical reality can't be defined in terms of measurements since that would mean anything you can't measure doesn't exist, e.g. - the core of the sun and dinosaurs. You can't measure the core of the sun because no measuring instrument will survive there. You can't measure dinosaurs because they no longer exist. You could say that the examples I gave and other don't exist, but then you have to throw out all science since it all refers to unobserved and unobservable events. A better idea about what exists was explained by David Deutsch in his book "The Fabric of Reality" chapter 4. Something exists if its existence is a consequence of our best explanations. For example, the core of the sun exists because its existence is implied by theories of stellar evolution, general relativity and other parts of physics. In addition, explanations aren't about feelings. The core of the sun isn't a feeling I have but it is featured in explanations. 

Morality is about how to make decisions. If morality is objective, then there are better and worse ways to make decisions that are independent of whether people accept them or not. Some ways of life are objectively very different from other ways of life. For most of human history, people were not able to do very much to change the world around them. People would grow up, age and die without being able to notice much in the way of progress. This is no longer the case. As recently as 20 years ago if you wanted to read a book, you had to go to a shop or order by mail and the seller would send you a large wad of paper. But that is no longer the case. You can buy and read a new book without getting out of your chair and without using any paper at all. That is an enormous difference in how we can do stuff that happened within living memory, and it is not an isolated example. What explains this difference? There are lots of different kinds of behaviour and ideas that have resulted in more rapid progress. One difference is that people are now allowed to question tradition, and try to create new traditions. Another difference is that people are now interested in looking for explanations about how the world works to a far greater extent than in the past. These traditions and many others have changed how people deal with one another, and have increased our capacity to control the world. Some people, both now and in the past, have seen this increased ability to control the world, and have wanted to destroy the traditions that made it possible. Hitler, Stalin, Pol Pot, the various rulers of North Korea, Iran and many other tyrants are all notable examples. Those people are evil. You might say that Hitler just has different preferences than you. But there is an objective difference between what Hitler wanted and what the West currently stands for, albeit very imperfectly. It is possible to make an unbounded improvement in our ability to understand and control the world, but it is not possible to make unbounded improvement in being a murderer and tyrant. 

I'm not a fan of the brain in the vat thought experiment because it is rather silly and understates the significance of many important problems. However, your argument against it is not much good. There are two problems with the claim that reality is what we perceive. First, many scientific explanations invoke things that nobody has ever perceived and that perhaps nobody ever will perceive. For example, nobody has seen the core of the sun. Maybe nobody ever will. Nobody has ever seen a dinosaur, only dinosaur skeletons. But in both instances there are many explanations about those unperceived entities. There is no way of explaining how the world works without them, so as far as we know they are real. Furthermore, your perceptions are not just showing the world the way it is. Rather, they introduce many layers of interpretation. This is what gives rise to optical illusions. Your visual system makes assumptions about the way the world works, so if you know those assumptions you can produce misleading effects by making suitable images or models. Reality as we know it is not what we perceive, nor is it derived from sense perception. Under some circumstances we can interpret what we see as true and other circumstances we know better. So under some circumstances we disregard what we see in light of an explanation. Rather our knowledge about how the world works comes from making guesses and then criticising those guesses. Sense perception can help us criticise guesses, but we can't know what the world is like just by looking at it.
