I have noticed after tennis matches, the athletes will wear coats even though they are sweating profusely. After heavy workout, I notice I need to wear heavy sweater, even though it is 90 degrees outside. Is this a good practice? What is the medical reason for this? 

Here's my routine Plyometrics 20 jumping jacks 40 ghost jump ropes (I don't use real rope) 60 jogging steps I interleave 4 sets of Plyometrics between three sets of weight-training. Lower calves are still slightly sore after two days (even when I walk I can feel the soreness), but I really want to get up and work out!!!!!!!! Is it safe for beginner to do so after lot of stretching, or is it better to wait another day? 

I wish to circumambulate around Mount Kailash on foot. This is roughly 33 miles of mountaineous terrain. Many people do this for spiritual reasons, i.e circumambulate once to wash away your sins, circumambulate 108 times to attain nirvana. I just want to circumambulate around Mount Kailash because I want to. What type of training do I require? I understand this can take years, even decades. Some information about me. 

Lady in late 30s, wishes to train for Spartan Race to compete in about two years (slow and steady wins the race) Currently I can 

I've always had knee problem did lot of knee strengthening as a kid/ adult Did hours on stationary bike on and off throughout teen and early adult years. Not athletic. Only in past year I was able to build up to 108 Surya Namaskars, plus do little stationary bike and lifting 10, 15 lbs at home. Currently dealing with hip tightness (posted separate thread) Lady, will turn 37 in few days, 146lbs, 5'4", excess belly fat 

Please advise starter indoor exercises that don't require extra $$$ In Springtime (May 2017) I hope to run outdoors. Honestly, I wish to run simple marathons, to expand circle of friends and enjoy myself ----- all while maintaining health. I would rather run New Years Eve marathon than sit home and stuff my face while waiting for Ball to Drop. 

I have to rest from exercise at least once a week. Maybe twice, but hope to make it just once a week. Can we do dynamic / static stretch those days. Especially if we have have joint stiffness, i.e hip stiffness. Thank you 

Please recommend more dynamic stretches that improve hip mobility. That will open up the hips. Also recommend other dynamic exercise for running, esp for couch to 5K. 

Help, I am really confused. Do they mean make 54 sets, i.e. 108 repetitions, or 108 sets? I am thinking they mean 54 sets (i.e. one set around the Sun), but now I'm not too sure. 

Unfortunately, the symptoms of hyponatremia are similar to severe dehydration. The safest way to address both of those problems after you have been doing a high intensity workout is to use a sports drink that replenishes your electrolytes (see the article). Essentially, adding more water in this state will dilute your already low supply of electrolytes. The sports drink will help in either case. Assuming you haven't just been doing a high intensity workout, and you are simply sipping water throughout the day, you are probably going to be just fine. Keep in mind that 8 glasses a day is a minimum recommended daily allowance. I personally drink roughly a gallon a day. According to the article linked to above I could go up to 1.6 gallons and still be OK. I don't know how I'd fit that in, but I could. My office has a water filter, so I re-use a water bottle and fill it with the filtered water throughout the work day. Some people just can't drink cold water, and they need it room temperature. Filling the water bottle lets you have the water convenient to you and sip on it throughout the day. I'll have 1.5L in the morning, and another 1.5L in the afternoon (after lunch). I have another refillable water bottle that is .5L and I sip on that throughout my workout. I tend to work through two of those between the weightlifting and cardio work. By that time, I am set for my daily requirements. Also keep in mind that when people recommend 8 glasses a day, they are talking about an 8oz glass (or .25L). That's only 2L a day. 

So using the numbers we are working with, a reasonable starting point to preserve muscle mass and emphasize fat burning would be this: 

Let's say you weigh 185 lbs. According to the advice above, you would need somewhere between 150-185g of protein every day. If you eat 4 times a day, that's 37-46g per meal. That's equivalent to 6-8 ounces of meat per meal. If you need to keep your Calories down and still meet the protein requirements, then a whey protein supplement is definitely a good way to do that. Replace one of the meals with a 2 scoop protein shake and you've got 40-56g of protein (depending on the supplement). I think it's admirable you want to start lifting weights. There will be many well meaning people who will say something that they heard from someone else, and have lost the original context--or never knew it. Protein supplement dose and frequency depends on your current dietary goals, which in turn are based on your current activities. 

I believe it's ok, but wanted to cross reference. Is it ok to exercise twice a day, 12 hours apart if say, you know next day you will not have chance to exercise? In this case I'd do low-impact cardio (like jogging instead of jumping jacks and ghost jump ropes), and I'd work a different muscle group. Any insights, past experiences? 

When to begin Couch to 5K Program. I can do 108 Surya Namaskar in one sitting (takes an hour). And I can stationary bike 15 minutes at a time. However, I have left tight hip for past 2+ weeks. I feel the discomfort when performing donkey kicks I was told to perform dynamic stretching for relief. Should I wait till hips are better, or can I gradually start couch to 5K now? Is there other stretches/exercises I can do to prepare for couch to 5K? Thank you. 

I tried Burpees and for past few days can manage to do Level 3 burpees, 2 sets of 3 reps I wish to work myself up to Level 5 burpees, i.e. including push-up and jump-up. How many Level 3 Burpees should I comfortably do before I attempt Level 5 burpees. Or should I attempt Level 5 burpees right away, even if it's only one or two per day. And how many Level 5 burpees should I do per day to give strength and endurance for successfully competing in Spartan Race or in general? Thanks. 

perform 108 Sun Salutations in one sitting (takes an hour) ride on Stationary Bike at maximum tension (that I can tolerate) for about an hour jog in apartment for an hour max pushups I can do is 2 sets of three lift 5lb leg weights (various exercises, currently 2 sets of 3 reps) lift 8lb free weights (especially trying to strengthen deltoid) 

I'm not sure if I should post here, or on Hinduism forum, as it is Yoga and Power workout. I have been doing Surya Namaskar in the morning. I am comfortable at 30 rounds. But according to tradition, they say reach to 108. Just now, I read this article, $URL$ which touts the 108 repetitions. But I get confused with the following 

When I attempt to do this exercise with 8lbs, I can barely lift my right arm, and my right deltoid actually hurts. I can lift my left arm easily. How to strengthen the right deltoid so it is symmetrical to left deltoid? 

I understand that one set of Surya Namaskar is a set of identical exercises, working the left and right sides of the body. So I guess someone can count one set of Surya Namaskar as two rounds, i.e. 

If you eat this every day, it will average out to about 0.5 kg lost a week. There are some strategies that help. For example, emphasize carbs and protein before, during and after training (15-20g protein each, with 3-4x as many carbs). This should give you energy for your training when you need it, and better prevent more fat storage. (Based on information from the Sport Nutrition Encyclopedia by Josh Thigpen et al). Some recent studies show that cardio does not burn muscle as much as previously thought, and it really depends on the mode of cardio. For example, the high impact of running has more affect on muscle building than riding a bike. Swimming, ellipticals, stationary bikes, or even going outside and riding a bike are all great ways to do the long slow cardio in a way that complements strength training. Adjusting as you lose As long as you are losing weight at a comfortable rate, you can keep up the status quo. However below are a few guidelines on how to adjust if weight loss is too fast or not fast enough: 

The key word in each of these bullet points is "emphasizes". You won't have any rep range that is exclusively myophibrilar or sarcoplasmic. Next, it's important to understand what myophibrilar and sarcoplasmic hypertrophy do in terms of muscle mass. 

Look familiar? That's right, the three most common compatible exercises are what makes up the triathlon. Weightlifting would actually work against you because it is an anaerobic activity. Cycling and swimming can help you in that they can provide more resistance, causing you to work harder. That in turn will help your legs get stronger while still using the same metabolic pathways, causing you to put forth less effort with each stride. The same will be the case if you keep increasing the incline on your treadmill. 

A hand off is simply asking the person to hand you the bar. I've found most people understand this phrase. These days I need them less and less as I'm focusing on higher rep ranges, and I have safeties. The basic idea is that if I can unrack it, I better be able to press it. That said, if I ever do testing, I may request a hand off to save my energy. 

If kickboxing is your true passion, then I might suggest dropping the swimming and add the weight training. That will help make the most of the food you are eating, and turn it into muscle--all while helping you get stronger in your sport. 

In the beginning, the weight will feel light. Really light. During this time focus on form, in about a month's time you'll start to feel the weight getting heavy. You are building anaerobic strength, you don't want to do aerobic conditioning. So, when you do your conditioning, do it after you lift and on the same day. Focus on high intensity intervals. It's better to use a crosstrainer, a rowing machine, or an elliptical machine because they get the upper and lower bodies involved. Go hard for a minute then go easy for a minute, and keep the cycle until you can't go any more or 20 minutes are up--whichever comes first. This is important: when you are having trouble doing the SL workout, you'll have to back off the conditioning. Also, rest on your rest days! You will only hurt yourself and start stalling sooner if you don't give your body time to rest and build the muscle you are asking it to do. You will be hungry after the session. If you limit your carbs only to after you work out, you will be doing good. Protein will be more your friend while you are trying to lose weight and get stronger. Anything your body doesn't use to build stronger muscles will be used for energy later. It helps you feel full longer, and keeps you from overeating.
