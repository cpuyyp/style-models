I think the question comes from misinterpretation of the expression "Romans abandoned". This was not related to any substantial movement of population. This only means that the Roman army (as an organized force) abandoned the defense and law enforcement in certain place. Population remained the same, part of it "Romanized", others not. The army itself partially withdrew partially simply dispersed, and in any case, the orders from the empire were not obeyed anymore. The process of destruction of the empire was slow and gradual. People who lived then, in most cases did not notice that the empire "stopped to exist" at certain moment. EDIT. I was asked to add references. Of course what I wrote is my own (condensed) opinion. But it comes from a lot of reading. Tons of literature exists on the subject beginning from Gibbon's Decline and Fall. So I just list some of my recent favorite books: B. Ward-Perkins, The fall of Rome and the end of civilization, Oxford UP 2006 Peter Heather, Fall of the Roman empire, Oxford UP, 2006. A. Goldsworthy, The fall of the West. The slow death of Roman superpower. And let me add two excellent works of fiction (unlike Hollywood movies, good literature is very helpful in such questions: a serious writer who studied the period, tries to imagine how it really was to live at that time. History books do not always give you this feel. But a good writer can do this after having digested many history books): Iain Pears, Scipio's dream. Pascal Quignard, On wooden tables: Apronenia Avitia (thansl. from French). 

It depends on your exact definition of magic. Magic in the broad sense was used a lot. Greek and Roman armies would never start a battle without a sacrifice. If the sacrifice was not accepted by the gods they would wait, then make another sacrifice etc. According to their accounts, magic was also used by barbarians. By Britons, for example. The use of magic by the ancient Jews is addressed in T. E. D.'s answer. In the later, Christian times, they often used the sacred relics, icons, and other such things in the battles. Constantine won a crucial battle by a very simple tool: he just ordered his troops to pain crosses on their shields. To be sure he and most of his army were pagans, but the crosses helped nevertheless. He was so impressed by his own victory that later he converted to Christianity, or at least they say so. Same simple and effective tool was used by the (mostly pagan) Britons in the battle of Mount Badon where they routed Anglo-Saxons against enormous odds. I am not even mentioning the many victories of the later Christian armies achieved by similar means. Similar magic methods are still widely used: $URL$ $URL$ (Perhaps some people would say that Christian rites are different from magic, but on my opinion this is all the same). Probably many more battles in history where won with some sort of magic than without. 

Rum is "associated with naval practice" mainly because it was issued to the sailors of the Royal navy. Earlier they used beer and/or wine as a part of daily ration. When the operations in Caribbean started, there were difficulties with procuring beer or wine. They tried rum, mixed with water. Gradually this became a tradition in the Royal navy. (Very slowly. They continued with rations of beer or wine for long time, and then used all three beverages). It ended only in 1970. Details can be found here: $URL$ EDIT. To address @Tyler Durden comments. 1. For simplicity I used the latest name "Royal navy", it is irrelevant for the question how British navy was called before 1707. The reason why rum is associated with navy (in popular movies and fiction) IS that the BRITISH navy used it. Otherwise nobody would care what they drunk in the Caribbean, as nobody cares what they drunk in Madagascar, or in the South China sea, or in the Mediterranean, or what they distributed as ration in Russian navy. 

I think Mustang's estimate is a gross overestimate. We are talking about surviving books. Loeb Classical Library has a stated goal to publish everything that survived from ancient Greece and Rome. Of course this is far from everything. They do not publish much of mathematics, astronomy, astrology and other special disciplines. (But this is not much in terms of volume). They do not publish small fragments. The library has about 500 volumes. Let us be generous and multiply this by 2 to get an upper estimate of what survived from the Greeks and Romans. Assuming that about the same amount survived from Medieval Europe we get about 2000. About China, from the sources pointed by Mustang I obtain about the same order of magniture. Adding the books in Arabic I can imagine something the final result less than 10,000. But certainly not 10-14 times more. On Mustang's methodology: a) When they say that the library of Constantinople had 100,000 books they mean 100,000 physical scrolls, not 100,000 titles. Many copies of one book could be kept. A book (title) usually consists of several scrolls. Same applies to Alexandria library. b) The rate of publishing "in a country of the size of China" that Mustang uses is the MODERN rate, according to the reference he cites. It is ridiculous to apply this rate to the Roman empire or to ancient China. To conclude, I suppose that the number of surviving titles must be less than 10,000, that is an order of magnitude less than Mustang's estimate. For further investigation, it is necessary to define what is counted as book. One clay tablet, or one piece of a papyrus sheet, or an inscription probably cannot be counted as a book. Herodotus Histories is one book (one title) nowadays. But it consists of 9 "books" (originally probably 9 scrolls). On my opinion, it is more reasonable to count words or characters, not books. Then clay tablets and papyri fragments will contribute. The best hing to count is words, because characters mean very different things in Chinese and Latin/Greek/European/Assyrian documents. EDIT. I do not really know much about Chinese (and Indian) history. My estimate of Greek/Roman surviving "books" is 1000, whatever one means by a "book". The rest of my answer is just an extrapolation. But I will be very much surprised if the number of surviving books in other languages is greater by an order of magnitude. 

The system you describe is only possible with very small population. Something like this existed in the city-states of ancient Greece, and city-states elsewhere, on their early stages. (But of course not EVERY person had a vote; women and slaves and immigrants and children of immigrants were usually excluded, and still there were officials appointed to run everyday business. But on important questions every citizen voted). Such system also existed in some "free cities" in Medieval times, where all important issues were decided by an assembly where all male citizens were eligible to vote. As these states developed and became larger, the power usually shifted to oligarchy more and more. Among the modern states the closest example is Republic of San Marino, where people just take turns to serve in the government. This city-state essentially preserved its medieval system. 

I am surprised that nobody mentions the example which is going on just now: it is in the news. The "Caliphate" destroys on purpose the ancient cultural sites in Iraq. Of course most of us do not recognize the "Caliphate" as a state, so perhaps this example does not qualify. But this only shows that the question is not well posed: what is a state? 

All large enough armies have to be organized on this hierarchic principle. Otherwise one will have not an army but a disorganized crowd which is impossible to control. All that we know about ancient armies shows that they were organized like this, another matter is that we do not know many details about some of them. The best known example is the Roman army which consisted of legions, centuriae and manipulae. Mongol army in the Middle age was organized by strictly decimal principle, at least in theory, into tens, hundreds, thousands and tens of thousands. In much smaller European feudal armies, each lord has his unit which obeyed him, and the lords of the units obeyed (in principle) the chief commander. So there were at least two steps of the hierarchic structure. 

Technicaly, Turkey participated: it entered the war on the Allies side on February 23, 1945, after a substantial allied pressure. Why it did not participate earlier, I think it is easy to answer. You "profit" from a world war only if you take the right side. In WWI Turkey (reluctantly) chose the wrong side, and the result was the collapse of the empire. Telling early which side is going to win was difficult, in both world wars. As I understand, after the collapse, the point of view prevailed that Turkey has to be a national state rather than empire (the Russians do not understand it even now). Therefore, it did not really want to try to restore the empire, preferring to stay neutral. It seems that empires are out of date since the second half of 20s century. EDIT:...at least in Europe and in the Middle East. 

Greek language did not survive in any territory conquered by Alexander, except in Greece itself. Apparently the Greeks in the conquered lands were tiny minorities concentrated in the cities that they built, and had little cultural contact with surrounding populations. The rest of population continued to speak their native languages everywhere. For example, Farsi (Iranian) survived from the time before the Greek conquest to the present day. (It is interesting to notice that modern Farsi writing is based on Arabic, while old Farsi was a written language with its own alphabet.) Muslim conquest was a very different thing: it affected profoundly entire conquered populations, including their languages. 

Historically, this is not a "curious fact" but rather a general rule. I mean the time when "national leaders" in Europe were monarchs. It is very common for a monarch to be a foreigner. Some examples: William I and William III of England, and their descendants, Romanov's dynasty in Russia after Peter I was mostly German. And most other European monarchs. 

This is a very interesting question though a definite answer probably cannot be given. I strongly disagree with Tom Au statement that Egyptian expedition "was a considerable success". It was a total failure: French army had to surrender and be evacuated from Egypt in British ships. What worse humiliation one can imagine?French navy was destroyed in the battle of of Aboukir Bay. If this is a "considerable success" then what is a complete failure? On my opinion, (and I agree with Tom here) the revolution was not so much against the monarchy but against the outdated social structure, privileges of nobility etc. In this respect Napoleon time was considered a continuation of the revolution. People did not like the terror and the government of the Directory, and it was clear that some kind of strong power or dictatorship was desirable, if the new social and economic order could be preserved. The idea that the revolution had "anti-foreign", "nationalistic" character is really interesting, but I would like to see more evidence of this, except the wording of the Marceillaise. There is some analogy with establishing empire in the Roman republic. The idea of monarchy was always extremely unpopular in Rome. And no emperor called himself a king, even in later times. But establishment of the empire was considered necessary to stop continuous civil wars. It seems clear that the French of the Napoleon times very clearly understood this analogy. Napoleon was called "Consul", and later "Emperor", the names taken from the ancient Rome. And he really was a warlord, like Caesar and August and many later emperors.
