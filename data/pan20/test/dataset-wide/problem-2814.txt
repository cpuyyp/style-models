That is why, Frege's analysis of a sentence like "the concept horse is a concept", is the following: 

The first is a physical principle and it does seem to be true of our universe, so we may go ahead and call it "natural". The second is a logical principle, which, having nothing to do with our universe is trivially going to be true of it. (2) may be applied to states of affairs in our universe, but that simply means that (2) has an application in the real world, not that it is about the natural world (not uncontroversial; cf. Pincock's The Applicability of Mathematics). Their difference, following Carnap, I would characterize as follows. 

Science proper here only consists in the pure part. That is why in his introduction to the Anthropology, he dismisses psychology as not being a science proper in any way, missing this pure part. Kant on philosophy as science It is the main point of the whole critical endevour of Kant to bring metaphysics (or philosophy as such) back on the "secure course of a science": 

That means that for Kant, everything that can be enforced by society through law belongs to morals, whereas all other duties (of a fair and just life that fullfils the full notion of a finite rational being that humans are) belong to ethics. This can be neatly intertwined with the considerations offered above, as laws for Kant are in the first place general rules in the strict sense (i.e. do not allow for exceptions). This means they include general/abstract considerations on socially relevant habits/customs, as they define and influence them. 

The Gödel–Cohen result establishes the independence of CH from ZF (with or without AC), not from any set theory whatsoever. In general, independence is a logical relation between a set of axioms and a sentence: sentence S is independent of axioms Γ just in case Γ neither proves nor refutes S (more precisely: just in case neither S nor its negation is in the closure of Γ under direct derivability). The truth of CH is a semantical matter and has no business in independence proofs. CH may be believed to be true by experts, for reasons I cannot hope to understand. Some might even believe that it has to be true, but whether CH is true or not, the important result here is that: if ZF is consistent, it is compatible both with CH and with its negation. As for examples of truths that cannot be proved, again, I would like to emphasize that provability, like independence, is a relative notion: sentence S is provable in syntactical/proof system Γ just in case there is a proof in Γ with S as its conclusion. Once the relativity of provability is recognized, it's easy to come up with examples of intuitively true but nevertheless unprovable statements such as the following sentence: "everything is self-identical". That sentence is not provable from the axioms of propositional calculus, but it is provable from the axioms of first-order logic with equality. Update: As regards the edit, if a sentence (e.g. CH) cannot be proved in a system (e.g. ZFC), then it cannot be proved in that system at time t, for any time t. Provability has very interesting connections to modal logic, but it itself is not a notion that depends on time or human knowledge. I wonder, however: 

Answer It is hypothetical because it hypothetically is in force all the time, because it establishes a relation between a specific end and specific means, which (in theory, based on our knowledge about the world) is always "correct". But its effectiveness is reduced to the specific situations where it is applyable, therefore it is not an imperative that is categorical, i.e. effective in every single act, but hypothetical, i.e. only effective if we want to achieve a specific end. In the end, the hypothetical refers to the big IF thought within a hypothetical imperative. Like in "IF my assumptions are correct, my hypotheses (i.e. the explanatory part of it) is also correct." And the analogy goes further: Just as our hypotheses in science, hypothetical imperatives have to be based on empirical knowledge and are therefore limited by what we (are able to) know about the world and the theoretical relations we infer from it, e.g. causation. This may be wrong and that's the main difference to the categorical imperative, which qua being a priori is necessarily correct. Textual Support from GMM Ak. 414: 

The Empty Set Axiom allows us to conclude that there is an empty set. Suppose there are two empty sets A and B. Vacuously, every member of A is a member of B (since A has no members), and vice versa. Therefore by the Axiom of Extensionality it follows that A and B are the same set. These facts (of the existence and the uniqueness of the empty set) allow us to denote it by the familiar symbol '∅'. I'm not at all familiar with ETCS, so I won't comment on that part of the question. 

Depending on your account of possibility and probability, these will have different explications. I will sketch a way of explicating (1), leaving you with Yalcin 2010 to work out how to explicate (2). What we need is a modal language with both alethic (e.g. Poss) and temporal (e.g. F) operators. I propose to use a temporal language and define the needed alethic modality in it instead of taking it as an undefined symbol. As usual, we start with the definition of the language: 

Immanuel Kant had a definite answer on this one in his Critique of Pure Reason. Further reading could be this related answer. TL;DR If to know something with certainty means having undoubtable, true thoughts, the answer is: We cannot even determine for certain whether we know anything about the world [i.e. anything that we learn through our senses], but we can know the form of our thinking (and sensing, and other faculties) for certain. His argument What is truth? 

In this text, there are further sources to be found for that argument probably being what Kant had in mind there as well. Aside In German, the translation of sui iuris - selbständig - coincedentally can be understood both as independent and self-employed, which may be understood as the modern equivalent of what Kant describes here. 

The problem with (1) is obvious: it's not a well-formed (or grammatical) sentence. The assumption here is that 'and' is an operator on sentences, so its placement in (1), in an NP position, takes us out of the set of grammatical sentences of English. From the logico-semantical point of view, (1) is as ungrammatical as the aforementioned "kjdfho" sentence, and thus belongs to the first class of 'pseudo-sentences'. The problem with (2), however, is not that it's not well-formed. 'Caesar' is a grammatically acceptable name of an individual, and 'is a prime number' is an acceptable predicate expression. Nevertheless, Carnap claims that (2) is meaningless, and gives the following explanation: 

If A → B, and ¬ A, then B can be said to be true by the monotonicity of implication. Since (A → B) is equivalent to (¬A ∨ B), because of monotonicity, since we know that ¬ A is true, we can immediately conclude that (¬A ∨ B) ≡ (A → B) is true, without having to evaluate B. There are all sorts of non-monotonic logics where this behavior is not implemented. That being said, Mauro's is probably exactly what you're looking for. I suspect the vacuous truth behavior stems from monotonicity, but I could be wrong. (am I?) 

I am very critical towards theories that try to describe (self-)conciousness as emerging property of systems only. Emergence is nothing more than an euphemism for surrender: It is the admission that the theory cannot explain this in any way and - more importantly - in some sense that the theory is lacking something. The evolutionary problem of the becoming of the conditions that make personal self possible is perhaps not explicable at all, at least I am not aware of any convincing explanation. But what already has been explained long before is the becoming of personal self in a being that already is capable of it because of the structure of its existance (a priori conditions in the best of its meanings). Self-conciousness or the knowledge of the self is traditionally defined by the possibility of reciprocal self-recognition by and in other selves. This reflects on the problem of Descartes: In order to realize cogito ergo sum you already have to have a self that is part of conciousness first and foremost. Most theories of the personal self I know that adress the becoming of it do at some point refer to what was first worked out by Fichte, who's concept of the absolute self is commonly rejected because of its idealistic implications, but nevertheless his dialectics of self and non-self for the becoming of self-conciousness is regarded as generally correct. This theory is elaborated in his Grundlagen der gesammten Wissenschaftslehre, reformulated in his Grundlagen des Naturrechts (opus postumum! from lectures and manuscripts), which (of course, like many other ingenius works of German Idealism -.-) is not yet to be found in English as far as I found out, only in German. In the most abstract (and methodologically elaborated) way of the conditions a priori for personal self that I am aware of is established, deducted and described by Plessner in his The Levels/Stages of (the) Organic and Man, Introduction to Philosophical Anthropology (translation at work, yet unpublished). But he also cannot say anything about the becoming of them. (Disclaimer for those professionals that dislike philosophical anthropology because of Gehlen and Heidegger: This is totally different and by far more philosophical). To summarize, the problem is far too complex to squeeze it in any format suitable for SE. And any answer given would hardly be accurate. What I can recommend for further reading is the only published book in English language that does introduce into this thinking: Plessner's Philosophical Anthropology 

Another method would be to use valuations (truth-tables). We want to show that v(¬(A ∨ ¬(A ∧ B))) = 0. The useful fact is: v(¬φ) = 1 - v(φ). We proceed as follows. 

I hope this is a bad joke, because it's not a good puzzle. I'll offer my initial thoughts anyway. A(ckermann) has written down some number x &in; {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9} in an envelope. Only he knows the referent of x, so B(eatrice) doesn't know in the beginning; neither does C(arl). Now let's look at the sentences and how they update the information we have: 

Modal languages look very much like non-modal ones. For example, if you have a non-modal propositional language generated by the following grammar: 

People saying that you need evidence for belief have a weird understanding of the word belief. As do people that say their belief was 'true', because truth is connected to knowledge and what you know, you don't need to believe. See "About meaning, knowing and believing" in Kant's Critique of Pure Reason, B 531-38. People like Richard Dawkins et al. are asking for scientific evidence, see here. That contradicts the notion of belief in God, but they do not care. They question the need for religious belief in modern times in general. The main point against them could be that belief (=faith) provides certainty beyond doubt while knowledge cannot. Empirical certainty has to be looked at as doubtful since Hume. The problem is that their certainty that they are right comes from their belief in the superiority of the scientific method, which is in fact unscientific, because science should be sceptical empiricism, as Hume was the first to state, not scientific realism. EDIT Inspired from @robert bristow-johnson I have an alternative reading now: The problem that occurs between atheists and theists may also lie in the use of language and slight equivocations. Dawkins et. al. seem to say that they would need a (scientific) evidence for the existance of God because a belief would explicitly have to be a belief about facts in the world. And the sort of certainty about facts in the world needed for this belief is only provided by science (sceptical empiricism). On the other side, a theist may be able to dodge this attack by saying the very notion of a belief in God would be that faith is all you need to be certain. A coherence with inner sentiments and his personal being is all "evidence" there can ever be. And perhaps even more, that in the moment you are looking for evidence in the world, you lost your faith, you are doubtful and not reachable for God's voice anymore. In this sense, they are talking about different spheres of reality and are not contradicting each other at all. And perhaps Dawkins would have to be seen as reductionalistic, because faith in fact has its reality in human experience. On the other side, every theist saying that God would be in the sense that he is a fact in the world could be seen as counterfactual and dogmatic, because talking about "the world" means talking about the sphere of experience that is shared by all of us ("objective" nature), not only the faithful ones. It would be a residuum of ancient times where more or less all people had to be (or pretend to be) faithful, so that there was not difference between the reality of nature and the reality of God. This is what the New Atheist movement is attacking (rightfully). But denying the existance and reality of faith is overdoing it. It is scienctific realism: only what science can "proof", is an ontological entity. And this is reductionalistic and falls through the old body-mind problem. It is falling back behind phenomenology and pragmatism, into the 19th century (of the history of philosophy). 

Proof. Let φ be an arbitrary proposition in Prop = {p, q}. If φ = p, since V(p) = {w2}, we have M, w2 |= p. If φ = q, since V(q) = {w1}, we have M, w1 |= q. Since φ was arbitrary, we have established the fact. The conclusion that you want to draw, however, does not hold for M: 

Ω stands for the set of "things that matter", which according to A is the set of all those propositions φ (about events and so on) that S thinks to be true. We can assume that there is another set Σ s.t.: 

You say that Socrates is as an object (type: &langle;e&rangle;), but you also, for some reason, claim that 'a man' too is an object. By previous reasoning you say that 'man' must be a concept, so how is 'man' both an object and a concept. 'A man', however, is not some particular man, so it's not an object. 'A' is semantically vacuous, and 'man' is an &langle;e,t&rangle;, which combined with an identity combinator 'is', yields the concept 'is a man' (type: &langle;e,t&rangle;), which when applied to 'Socrates' gives us a &langle;t&rangle;. Nothing confusing going on there. You make some plausible (and familiar) conclusions about how we could go about resolving the concept horse problem. It is, for example, an attractive proposal to say that 'horse' is both an object and a concept, depending on its syntactical role. As Frege says in that excerpt: we could say that horse is a concept (of type &langle;e,t&rangle;), but when it occurs in object positions, it is automatically converted to an object (of type &langle;e&rangle;). An analogous situation happens in programming when you have a floating-point expression like 4.0 and you pass it to sqrt (the square root function), which is defined only for non-negative integers. 4.0 is converted to 4 and then sqrt(4) yields the expected value(s). 4.0 (or horse) stays what it is, but in an expression like sqrt(4) (or 'the concept horse is a concept'), it is automatically converted to an acceptable type so that the expression can have a meaningful value. How plausible a solution this is to the concept horse problem? Who knows? It's a proposal and will no doubt have its pros and cons.                                                                      References ➀ Cumming, S.
