I've been using the representation result below, from Krasnosel'skij/Lifshits/Sobolev; Positive Linear Systems---The Method of Positive Linear Operators. Heldermann Verlag, 1989. Theorem. Let $E$ be a real Banach space partially ordered by a solid, normal and minihedral cone $E_+$. Then there exist a compact Hausdorff space $Q$ and a linear homeomorphism $\Phi: E \rightarrow C(Q)$ such that $\Phi(E_+) = C_+(Q)$. In this statement, $C(Q)$ stands for the space of continuous, real-valued functions on $Q$, while $C_+(Q)$ consists of the nonnegative ones. This is stated as Theorem 6.6 on page 64 in the book. I'm wondering if anybody knows of a better presentation of this result. It's not the first time that I've been having problems with this book, which has many mistakes. The original paper of Kakutani from 1941 doesn't seem much easier to read, and Google searches haven't yielded much on that direction. Thanks! 

It is written in wikipedia that Bochner-integral is an extension of Lebesgue integral, but I am curious in what sense it is an extension. If this is true, is there any textbook treating these contents? There is nothing on these in standard textbooks..(such as that by Joseph) 

Let $X$ be a $\sigma$-compact topological space and $(Y,d)$ be a metric space. Let $\{K_n\}$ be a sequence of compact subsets of $X$ whose union is $X$. Define $\rho_n(f,g):=\sup \{d(f(z),g(z)): z\in K_n\}$ and $\rho(f,g)=\sum_{n=0}^\infty (\frac{1}{2})^n \frac{\rho_n(f,g)}{1+\rho_n(f,g)}$ for all $f,g\in C(X,Y)$. Then, it can be directly checked that $\rho$ is a metric on $C(X,Y)$. Assuming $K_n\subset int(K_{n+1})$ for all $n$, it can be easily shown that $\rho$ induces the compact-open topology on $C(X,Y)$. However, this conditions seems too strong. In Conway's functions of one complex variable text, it's written there that if $X$ is Baire in addition, then it can be still shown that $\rho$ induces the compact-open topology. However, I don't underatand why. How is it so? Is there any reference for it? 

I think I got it! I turned out to be mistaken about item 2 in my Progress Notes. Lemma 1. Suppose $f \colon {\mathbb R}_{\geqslant 0} \rightarrow {\mathbb R}_{\geqslant 0}$ is locally integrable, and let $F\colon {\mathbb R}_{\geqslant 0} \rightarrow {\mathbb R}_{\geqslant 0}$ be the primitive given by $$ F(t) := \int_0^t f(s)\,ds\,, \quad t \geqslant 0\,. $$ For any positive integer $m$, set $f\colon {\mathbb R}_{\geqslant 0}^m \rightarrow {\mathbb R}_{\geqslant 0}$ by $$ f_m(t) := \prod_{i = 1}^m f(t_j)\,, \quad t = (t_1,\ldots,t_m) \in {\mathbb R}_{\geqslant 0}^m\,, $$ and set $$ S_m(T) := \{t \in {\mathbb R}_{\geqslant 0}^m\,;\ 0 \leqslant t_1 \leqslant \cdots \leqslant t_m \leqslant T\}\,, \quad T \geqslant 0\,. $$ Then $$ \int_{S_m(T)} f_m(t)\,dt = \frac{[F(T)]^m}{m!}\,, \quad \forall T \geqslant 0\,, \quad \forall m = 1, 2, 3, \ldots\,. $$ Proof. Follows by Fubini and integration by substitution. (Details/clarification upon request.) Assuming that $f(t,\cdot)$ is compactly supported uniformly in $t$ as described in item 1 of my Progress Notes, we may apply Lemma 1 to show that $(\varphi_k(\cdot,x))_{k \geqslant 0}$ is a Cauchy sequence on $[0,T]$ for each $T \geqslant 0$. Thus $$ \varphi(t,x) = \lim_{k \to \infty} \varphi_k(t,x)\,, \quad \forall (t,x) \in {\mathbb R}_{\geqslant 0} \times {\mathbb R}^n\,. $$ 

Let $\mu$ be the $n$-dimensional Lebesgue measure and $\lambda$ be a complex Borel measure on $\mathbb{R}^n$. Let $S$ be the set of points $x\in \mathbb{R}^n$ where $\lim_{r\to 0} \frac{\lambda (B(x,r))}{\mu (B(x,r))}$ exists in $\mathbb{C}$. Then, is $S$ a Borel set? Moreover, is $\lambda (S)=0$? 

Let $(X,\mathfrak{M})$ be a measurable space and $E$ be a Banach space and $f:(X,\mathfrak{M})\rightarrow E$ be a function. 

The author defines $C^k$ differentiable structures as the equivalence classes of atlases. However, is it a set and well-defined? Alternatively, let $X$ be a set and $\mathscr{A}$ be a $C^k$-atlas on $X$. Then, does there exist a maximal atlas with respect to the $C^k$-compatible relation? Unlike the union of Euclidean spaces form a set (i.e. $\bigcup_{n\in\mathbb{N}} \mathbb{R}^n$), the collection of all Banach spaces form a class. Hence, the usual argument for this problem on euclidean differentiable manifolds cannot be applied here. How do we define a differentiable structure? 

One may assume without loss of generality that $f(t,\cdot)$ is compactly supported uniformly in $t$; that is, there exists a compact $K \subseteq {\mathbb R}^n$ such that $f(t,x) = 0$ whenever $x \notin K$. Setting $\varphi_0(t,x) := x$, then $$ \varphi_k(t,x) := x + \int_0^t f(s, \varphi_{k-1}(s,x))\,ds\,, \quad k = 1, 2, 3, \ldots\,, $$ recursively, as in the standard proof of existence, doesn't seem to work. Euler's proof of existence seems to almost work. But the construction is not "canonical" in the sense that the subsequence along which convergence occurs via Arzela-Ascoli will depend on $f$. I would like to have a sequence $(\varphi_k)_{k \in {\mathbb N}}$ which could be defined by a procedure independent of $f$. This is because I'm ultimately interested in the flow of parametrized differential equations, and I don't want to have to choose a different subsequence for each parameter. 

Reference: Lang - Differential manifolds p.123 Quick question: Lang defines the cotangent bundle as the dual vector bundle of the tangent bundle, but shouldn't there be additionally a somewhat canonical differentiable structure on the cotangent bundle? (Or does the dual vector bundle naturally determine the differentiable structure?) How do I define such canonical differentiable structure? Let me illustrate my approach in detail below: Let $X$ be a Banach $C^k$-manifold. Define $C_p(X)$ as the class of $(c,v)$ where $c=(U,\phi,E)$ is a chart at $p$ and $v\in E$. (Note that $U$ denotes a coordinate domain and $\phi$ denotes a coordinate map and $E$ denotes a Banach space where $\phi$ is mapping to) Now, define an equivalence relation on $C_p(X)$ as follows: $((U,\phi,E),v)\sim((V,\psi,F),w)$ iff $D(\psi\circ \phi^{-1})(\phi(p))(v)=(w)$ Define a map $\mathscr{O}_c^p:E \rightarrow C_p(X)/\sim: v\mapsto [(c,v)]$. Then, it can be shown that $\mathscr{O}_c^p$ is a bijection. Using this map, we can isomorphically give a vector space structure on $C_p(X)/\sim$, and this structure can be shown independent of choice of charts $c$. Let $T_p(x)$ denote this set equipped with the natural vector space structure. Moreover, we can homeomorphically give a Banachable topology on $T_p(X)$ using those maps $\mathscr{O}_c^p$. Now, define $T_p^*(X)$ as the collection of continuous linear functionals on $T_p(X)$. So that $T_p^*(X)$ is a Banachable space too. With these terminologies (which are standard as far as I know), let's define the cotangent bundle. Define $T^*X:=\bigcup_{p\in X} (\{p\}\times T_p^*(X))$, and let $\pi^*:T^*X\rightarrow X$ be the map such that $\pi^*(p,y)=p$. Let $c=(U,\phi,E)$ be a chart of $X$. Define $\mathscr{D}_c ^p:T_p^*(X)\rightarrow E^*: A\mapsto A\circ \mathscr{O}_c^p$. Note that this map is linear homeomorphism. Define $U^*:=(\pi^*)^{-1}(U)$, and $\phi^*(p,A)=(\phi(p),\mathscr{D}_c^p(A))$ for each $(p,A)\in U^*$. Now define $c^*:=(U^*,\phi^*,E\times E^*)$. Then, $\phi^*:U^*\rightarrow E\times E^*$ is an injection and $\phi^*(U^*)=\phi(U)\times E^*$ is open and $E\times E^*$ is Banachable. Hence, $c^*$ is a chart on the set $T^*X$. Take the unique differentiable structure generated by those $c^*$'s, and call the set $T^*X$ together with this differentiable structure the cotangent bundle of $X$. Would it be the correct one?
