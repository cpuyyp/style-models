For each $0\not=x\in E$ there is $\mu\in X$ with $\mu(x)\not=0$; For each $\Phi\in E^{**}$ there is $x\in E$ with $\mu(x) = \Phi(\mu)$ for all $\mu\in X$. 

So I think this works. Fix $1<r<\infty$ and let $r'$ be the conjugate index to $r$ so $1/r + 1/r' = 1$. Let $$ \tau = \sum_n S_n \otimes T_n \in \mathcal{A}(\ell^q,\ell^p) \widehat\otimes \mathcal{A}(\ell^p, \ell^q), $$ where by definition, $\sum \|S_n\| \|T_n\| < \infty$. By rescaling the $S_n$ and $T_n$ we may suppose that $$ \sum_n \|S_n\|^{r'} < \infty, \quad \sum_n \|T_n\|^r < \infty. $$ Define $T:\ell^p \rightarrow \ell^r(\ell^q)$ by $T(x) = \big( T_n(x) \big)$. This makes sense as $$ \|T(x)\|^r = \sum_n \|T_n(x)\|^r \leq \|x\|^r \sum_n \|T_n\|^r \qquad (x\in \ell^p). $$ For later, note that if $N$ is large and $T'(x) = (T_1(x), T_2(x), \cdots, T_N(x), 0, 0, \cdots)$ then $\|T(x) - T'(x)\| \leq \|x\| \Big(\sum_{n>N} \|T_n\|^r\Big)^{1/r}$ and so $T'$ approximates $T$ in norm if $N$ is large. Similarly we have $S:\ell^{p'} \rightarrow \ell^{r'}(\ell^{q'})$ given by $S(y) = \big( S_n^*(y) \big)$, using that $S_n^*: \ell^{p'} \rightarrow \ell^{q'}$ and that $\|S_n^*\| = \|S_n\|$ for each $n$. Then a simple calculation shows that $$ S^* : \ell^r(\ell^q) \rightarrow \ell^p; \quad (x_n) \mapsto \sum_n S_n(x_n). $$ Thus $S^*T= \sum_n S_n T_n = \Delta(\tau)$. Let $r=q$ and use the natural isomorphism $\ell^q(\ell^q) \cong \ell^q$ to see that $T:\ell^p\rightarrow \ell^q$ and $S^*:\ell^q\rightarrow\ell^p$. As the isomorphism is compatible with the dual pairing, we still have $S^*T=\Delta(\tau)$. It remains to argue that $T,S^*$ are approximable (limit of finite-rank) operators. It is clear that $T'$ (as defined above) is approximable, and so as $\mathcal A(E,F)$ is closed for any Banach spaces $E,F$, we see that $T$ is indeed approximable. Thus so is $S$, and hence $S^*$ by a well-known theorem (I don't recall who to attribute this to, but it follows from the Principle of Local Reflexivity). 

Here's the discrete group argument, when $A=\mathbb C$. Then $C_c(G,A)$ is just the algebra of finitely supported functions $G\rightarrow\mathbb C$, which has a basis $(\delta_g)_{g\in G}$ say. That $\pi:C_c(G,A)\rightarrow B(H)$ is a $*$-representation means that firstly $\pi(\delta_e)$ is a self-adjoint idempotent; so wlog we may assume $\pi(\delta_e) = 1_H$ (or else just restrict to the invariant subspace of $H$). Then, as $\delta_g^*=\delta_{g^{-1}}$, $$ 1_H = \phi(\delta_g^* \delta_g) = \phi(\delta_g)^* \phi(\delta_g). $$ Similarly $\phi(\delta_g) \phi(\delta_g)^* = 1_H$. So $\phi(\delta_g)$ is a unitary. It now follows that $\phi$ extends to a contraction from $\ell^1(G)$. I think a similar argument works for any $A$. Edit: For a compact group, it's easier, by virtue of hiding the work in known structure results. Let $Pol(G)$ be the collection of matrix coefficients of finite dimensional (unitary) representations-- this a is a dense $*$-subalgebra of $C(G)$. If we view $C^*(G)$, the universal $C^*$-completion of $L^1(G)$, as a direct sum of full matrix algebras, then $Pol(G)$ exactly corresponds to the algebraic direct sum of full matrix algebras. From this picture, you can see that any $*$-representation of $Pol(G)$ is contractive for the $C^*(G)$ norm. 

Let $\Phi\in X''$ be non-zero, let $\alpha_0\in X'$ be such that $\Phi(\alpha_0)=1$, and let $A$ be the collection of $\alpha\in X'$ with $\Phi(\alpha)=0$. Then $A$ is a subspace of $X'$, and any $\beta\in X'$ is equal to 

Let $\Gamma$ be a discrete group (though this could be asked for general locally compact groups) and consider the Banach $*$-algebra $\ell^1(\Gamma)$. We have two natural $C^*$-algebra completions: the reduced group $C^*$-algebra $C^*_r(\Gamma)$ which is the closure of $\ell^1(\Gamma)$ acting by left translation on $\ell^2(\Gamma)$; and the full group $C^*$-algebra $C^*(\Gamma)$ which is the universal C$^*$-algebra completion of $\ell^1(\Gamma)$. My (extremely hazy) intuition is that while $C^*(\Gamma)$ is the maximal $C^*$-completion, also $C^*_r(\Gamma)$ is the "minimal" one. But I can't really justify this. Is it right? To be precise: 

Let $V$ be the vector space of all sequences which are eventually zero. Let $L$ be the backwards shift-- this is obviously "locally nilpotent". Given $V$ the norm $$ \| (x_n) \| = \sum_n a_n x_n, $$ where $(a_n)$ is some sequence of positive numbers. Let $e_n$ be the vector which is 1 in the $n$th place, and zero elsewhere. Then $$ \exp(L)(e_n) = (\cdots,1/2,1,1,0,\cdots), $$ where the final 1 is in the $n$th place. So $$ \|\exp(L)(e_n)\| / \|e_n\| \geq (a_{n-1}+a_n)/a_n = 1 + a_{n-1}/a_n. $$ Hence just choose $(a_n)$ so that $( a_{n-1}/a_n )$ is an unbounded sequence, and then $\exp(L)$ will be unbounded. E.g. $(a_n)=(1,2,1,3,1,4,1,\cdots)$ will work. 

Let $E$ be a Banach space, and $M=E^*$ (my application has $M$ a von Neumann algebra, but this is unimportant). Let $(\sigma_t)$ be a SOT cts one-parameter group on $E$: so for $t\in\mathbb R$, we have that $\sigma_t$ is an invertible isometry on $E$, and $\sigma_t \sigma_s=\sigma_{t+s}$, and for each $\mu\in E$, the map $\mathbb R\rightarrow E; t\mapsto\sigma_t(\mu)$ is continuous. Overload notation, and let $(\sigma_t)$ also denote the adjoint group acting on $M$, so that $\langle \sigma_t(x), \mu \rangle = \langle x, \sigma_t(\mu) \rangle$ for $x\in M, \mu\in E$. We have the notion of the analytic continuation of $(\sigma_t)$. For example, set $S(i) = \{ z=t+iy\in\mathbb C : 0<y<1 \}$ with closure $\overline{S(i)}$. Then $D(\sigma_i)$ consists of those $\mu\in E$ such that there is a bounded continuous map $f:\overline{S(i)}\rightarrow E$ with $f$ analytic on $S(i)$, and with $f(t) = \sigma_t(\mu)$ for $t\in\mathbb R$. Then we set $\sigma_i(\mu) = f(i)$. Similarly we can do this for $\sigma_t$ acting on $M$. 

The finitely support probability measures on $\mathbb Z$ are all members of $\ell^1(\mathbb Z)$. So we could ask a slightly more general question: 

Edit: This is correct, except for the actual application to the question at hand, which is wrong; see below for details. I learnt about this technique from: MR2526788 (2010m:46098) Haagerup, Uffe(DK-SU-CS); Musat, Magdalena(1-MEMP) Classification of hyperfinite factors up to completely bounded isomorphism of their preduals. J. Reine Angew. Math. 630 (2009), 141–176. See pages 149--150. Let $M,N$ be von Neumann algebras. Recall that any function $\phi\in M^*$ has a unique decomposition as $\phi=\phi_s+\phi_n$ where $\phi_n\in M_*$ and $\phi_s$ is "singular". For $T:M\rightarrow N$ a bounded linear map, we can similarly decompose $T=T_n+T_s$ where $T_n,T_s:M\rightarrow N$ are bounded linear maps with $$ \phi\circ T_n = (\phi\circ T)_n, \quad \phi\circ T_s = (\phi\circ T)_s \qquad (\phi\in N_*). $$ It's easy to see that if $T$ is (C)P then so are $T_s,T_n$. An original reference for this claim is: MR0107825 (21 #6547) Tomiyama, Jun On the projection of norm one in W∗-algebras. III. Tôhoku Math. J. (2) 11 1959 125–129. $URL$ So, for your question, let $\Phi_1:\mathcal{A}\rightarrow \mathcal L(H)$ be any UCP extension, and let $\Phi = (\Phi_1)_n$. So $\Phi$ is normal and UCP. As $\Phi_0$ is normal, $(\Phi_0)_n = \Phi_0$ (if there is a problem, it's at this point: what precisely is your definition of "normal" for a UCP map from an operator system?) and so $\Phi$ extends $\Phi_0$ as required. Edit: This is nonsense as Taka points out. I was claiming that $(\Phi_1)_n=\Phi_0$ on $\mathcal R$, or equivalently that $$ \langle \omega, (\Phi_1)_n(a) \rangle = \langle \omega, \Phi_0(a) \rangle \qquad (a\in \mathcal R,\omega\in\mathcal{B}(H)_*), $$ which is in turn equivalent to $$ \langle (\omega\circ\Phi_1)_n, a \rangle = \langle \omega\circ (\Phi_1)_n, a \rangle = \langle \omega\circ\Phi_0 , a \rangle \qquad (a\in \mathcal R,\omega\in\mathcal{B}(H)_*). $$ That $\Phi_0$ is normal might be taken to mean that $\omega\circ\Phi_0 \in \mathcal{R}_*$ (if $\mathcal R$ is weak$^*$-closed, say). But all we know about $\Phi_1$ is that $\Phi_1(a)=\Phi(a)$ for $a\in\mathcal R$, which seems to tell us nothing about $(\omega\circ\Phi_1)_n\in\mathcal{A}_*$ restricted to $\mathcal R$.
