Perhaps just the max height for a single box jump/vertical jump (if you don't want technique to be a factor for improvement). I'm hoping/expecting that your setup allows you to increase height. I have a friend who was box jump training for a bit, he gained a few inches over maybe 2-3 months of intensive training. But I think doubling your box jump height is a lot harder than doubling your squat weight! 

I know some people like to throw squats in the mix for more off the wall push power, but I'd say that it's lesser importance unless you're in some serious competitions. In which case, you would have asked this question to your team physio/gym trainer! 

One factor to consider is that if you've set yourself a high calorie & protein intake, one which challenges your normal appetite, a recovery shake immediately plus a meal some hours afterwards may be easier for hitting your intake goal than just one larger meal hours afterwards. 

Gripping tight would also create tension in your body, which helps for exciting the CNS. Here is a link: $URL$ It would get your grip stronger, it would increase your pull-up power. 

It all depends on your goal. That phenomenon is also called reverse dieting, increasing your maintenance calorie so that it would be easier to cut it later for dieting. If you are following a meal plan, your macros are always the same. They all increase in size, not just one. 

First, please read Stuart McGill's work, and his ideas about core training. Second, abs should be braced when you are doing forward flexion; and "glutes" must be contracted when you are doing extensions. The move you are trying to do is done before, in a better way, and it is called "not back extension", but a "reverse hyper machine": $URL$ 

Smith Machine is not, and cannot be an alternative to full squat. It works the leg alright, but leg press does that too. Goblet squats are better and superior, you made a good choice. I would recommend you to decrease your cadence, get your reps slower, thus more time under tension, and it will tire you more. Front squats are good, but I believe they are harder to do, simply because it needs perfect rack position and mobility. I would say until you can get a Squat Rack, stick with Goblet Squats. Increase your reps, decrease your resting time, and slower reps would help the exercise to get harder. 

They are a carb-heavy option, so that's a huge plus if you're in the earlier stages of bulking, but likely a minus if you're in the latter chiselling stages. 

Cable flys - these were my favourite! Go for pulling from full extension, this is great for having a powerful pull at maximum reach. Slight bend in the elbow, just like your initial underwater pull. Biceps curls - pretty boring, but important Triceps - use free weights, extend from half to full. Heaps of ways to do this and they're all pretty similar. Shoulders - free weights, extend to horizontal on your side and front Rows - your traps are helpful in the pull sequence, but more so it's just good to work the opposite muscles so you keep your muscle development equal. Bench press - covers the above muscles quite well. Pull ups/machine pull downs - real important Abs with weights - whether it be sit ups with plates or pulling on a cable, it's all good - gives your off the wall dolphin kicks more grunt Back extensions with weights - just as important as the abs 

Well, without seeing your squat form, anyone giving any recommendations would not be correct. It seems like people think running is a great exercise; well it is not :) It can create problems, and many of us don't have any idea about running properly (not talking about you specifically) HIIT is not a must in order to lose fat, or exercise. You can do both without implementing HIIT in your training. 

Your question is wrong, your view is also wrong. But I am going to give my 2 cents regardless. First; Deadlift is a pull, squat is a squat. Squat starts from the top, deadlift starts from the bottom. Knees do not lift anything, if you try and do that you are going to destroy them eventually. Doing deadlifts for repetitions and/or using little rest periods can make your lower back sore, not because you are shortening your erector spinae, but rather because you are using them isometrically. Back does not lift anything, it pulls. And that move is called a barbell row. While deadlifting, your back works because it is trying to stay neutral and stiff not because you are lifting. Actually, that lift is done by hamstrings. It seems like you think that lifting should be done via a deadlift or a squat, whereas it is done by both deadlifting, squatting, and pressing if necessary. Please watch a video of an atlas stone lift. 

Seems like too many comments and not enough answers! You need to do backstroke along with freestyle, because: 

At pools where I swim, there's usually an clock somewhere in sight. If I know my starting time and my pace, a quick head glance during a breath when needed keeps me on track. 

I found huge improvements from taking on gyming while swimming - specifically muscular strength and endurance. That is, until I overtrained and heavily damaged my back. Be wise and know your limits! How often? I think two to three swim sessions to one gym session is a good ratio. If you're a sprinter, maybe more towards two to one swim sessions to one gym session. How many sessions a week that ends up being depends on how into the sport you are! A competitive swimmer may be doing 7-10 swim sessions a week, coupled with 3-4 gym sessions would be a nice mix. Make sure you give enough time for your muscles to recover. Throwing gym into the mix puts a much higher demand on your muscles. Sets and Reps I did freestyle mid-distance events, 200 m up to 800 m, so my focus was more on endurance reps. For standard workouts, I would do 3 sets of 20, and gradually increased weights accordingly. I did them at a similar speed to swimming stroke rate, except for legs of course. I frequently did circuit training - 30 seconds on, 30 seconds off, go to the next exercise, around 70% of my max or greater. This was the money, I loved these workouts! One stupid set I frequently did was pyramid sets on quads until muscle strain. 20 reps, climb weight until you injure your muscles, then climb back down. I actually didn't realise that I was straining my muscles, the 5+ days for my quads to recover despite my well conditioned muscles should have been an obvious clue! Routines Think through what muscles hold you back the most, and focus on them. 

There are different ideas about jumping exercises. I cannot show any references right now, but some people believe doing explosive work increases explosiveness; whereas some people only believe that increasing strength is the only way to increase explosiveness. I believe that one should work out as needed. For example, do you need to do box jumps? Do you need jumping in your daily life? Do you need to get better at jumping and jumping higher? If not, I do not believe that doing box jumps would bring you extra benefit than regular strength training. However, the risk of injury is higher with jumping, which means you need to be more careful with it. 

The number of reps is not magic, what is important is how hard you work your muscles. Our muscles recruit more motor units with they see more force. The simplest and safest way to do this is doing HIT (not hiit). So, go slow and go 'til you drop. Make sure you use your muscles 100%. It doesn't matter how many reps you do but how much you force your muscles, so that they use all motor units available. But, if you just want to get bigger muscles, eat more and lift 'more' weight :) 

If it must be at home, then it really depends on the architecture and furnishings of your house. My friend's place has a floating beam in the living room, which is not bad for doing pull ups on. I don't have such a beam - not everyone is going to have something at home that's satisfactory for pull ups. So that's when you need to check out places outside of home. Playgrounds, alleyways, forests - get creative and you'll figure something out. Though be prepared to look a little silly! Edit/update: I've just bought myself a pull up/dip tower, and it's been a brilliant investment. I've done more pull ups in the past few weeks than I have in years. As nice as it is to not spend money, you ought to invest if you're serious about exercise. 

Honestly I think that's the bulk of it, it's really about the reversed shoulder motion and the back-focused rather than chest-focused work. If your freestyle stroke is good, both your biceps and triceps would be getting worked hard. Kick is fairly equal on both hamstring and quads. Align the reps and sets to how you swim freestyle - if you mainly sprint, build power, if you mainly do long distance, build endurance. 

There is something called a hollow position: $URL$ This should be your position while doing pullups. Bracing your abs and contracting your glutes would probably end your pain. 

Strength would help in everything. So, squats and deadlifts are going to help you in any sport there is. Are you sure your form is good or perfect? A video would help for us to analyze if there is any problem. 

I cannot know your motivation for finding research papers on this topic, but personally I do not find papers on these matters very informative or trusty. Simply because you cannot create a really objective control group. I am sure you can find some papers about linear progression, because it is the basis of all strength. It is generally known, that if someone has a problem with their feet, first medical doctors try to move their toes, then feet, then legs etc. That is linear progression. here is the link; $URL$ By the way, starting strength has a forum where you can learn mainly really cool stuff. Just be quiet on the forums, and search your way, read your way. It will help you and give you ideas. 

Rows, where you bring your arms out back and wide thereby extending pectoral muscles - this is a nice opposite to the heavy pectoral work that freestyle does, should help build a good range of motion. Rotator cuffs in the direction opposite to freestyle. Free weights would probably be best, basically just keeping your upper arm steady and rotating as your forearm lifts up. 

Though I'm keeping my legs straight, maybe I should bend them slightly? My goal is to get past 90 degrees, but I don't want to compromise strength or explosive power, particularly for jumps and sprints. Given this, my reading says to do an exercise that reaches peak extension of the hamstring whilst subjecting the muscle to a substantial force. I'm home-gymming with a very basic setup at the moment, so the less equipment required, the better. What exercise(s) should I do? I've tried the exercise shown above with rubber cords and some gradual movement, though my arms don't provide enough resistive force for my hamstrings. 

It is very hard to answer your question without seeing you, or having your body composition values. However, a muscle cannot be toned, it can either grow or shrink (hypertrophy and atrophy). Also, since there is gravity, you cannot expect a muscle to be tight all the time :) 

If you don't know how to throw a punch, please don't. You may injure your wrists and shoulders. In order to burn fat and lose weight, the most important aspect is your diet. Adjust your diet, you will lose fat. 

I don't have any papers, and I don't hate pulldown machines. The main difference is core activation. In a proper pullup, you brace your abs, you contract your glutes and keep your spine in a complete stiff position. Where in a pulldown machine, unfortunately this is very hard to do. 

A lot of people are saying otherwise too. The important distinction is the difference between flexibility and mobility. People think flexibility is important, but it is actually inferior to mobility. I would recommend you to look at Kelly Starrett's videos and talks; also he has a very good book about mobility which is called Becoming a Supple Leopard. Lastly, it is never a good idea to stretch cold muscles. If you want to do stretching, please do a light warmup before hand, and choose dynamic stretching over static stretching. Overall, the most important thing is doing full range of motions, without using any momentum in your training.
