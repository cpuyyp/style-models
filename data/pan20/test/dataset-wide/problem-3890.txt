OK, the conjecture is false, as noted below. However there was a comment below about the property of approximate identities and whether this might still be true. After some thought I think that the problem is related to functional calculus of several commuting operators. Or rather to this modification: What happens to the functional calculus of several bounded operators which only almost commute, $f(T,S)$ where $\|[T,S]\|<\epsilon$? For an approximate identity we do have for fixed $n$, $\|[u_n,u_m]\|\to 0$ as $m\to\infty$, so it might still be possible to formulate the construction if a small commutator does not matter... Yes, making this into a general note about functional calculus of two non-commuting operators is a but of an extrapolation..... 

Let $G$ be a connected reductive group over a complete discrete valuation field with perfect residue field (or just a non-arch local field). Let $\mathcal{B}$ be its reduced Bruhat-Tits building, and $d(\cdot,\cdot)$ the distance function on $\mathcal{B}$. I am wondering if the following statement is true: There exists a constant $C$ such that for any compact element $x\in G$ (i.e. $\{x^n|n\in\mathbb{Z}\}$ is contained in a compact subgroup), and any $p_1, p_2\in\mathcal{B}$ such that $x.p_1=p_2$, there exists $p_0\in\mathcal{B}$ with $$x.p_0=p_0,\;d(p_0,p_1)\le C\cdot d(p_1,p_2).$$ What I actually want is have an explicit $C$ in terms of $G$. For example, I'll guess that $C$ can be bounded by a constant multiple of the rank of $G$. E.g. when the rank is $1$ the assertion is true for $C=\frac{1}{2}$. 

This question is about mapping finitely generated projective modules over $C^*$ algebras (or K-theory classes - I don't mind much) under maps between algebras. If we have an idempotent matrix $P\in M_n(A)$ and a star algebra map $\phi:A\to B$ then taking $\phi(P)$ (applying to each entry) will give another idempotent. However suppose that we only have a completely positive map $\psi:A\to B$ -- what do we do then? One possible way would be to use the KSGNS theorem to say that $\psi$ is given by a Hilbert bimodule structure on some $M$ together with an element $m\in M$. The module given by the applying the map to an $A$-module $E$ might be taken as $M\otimes_A E$ (or rather the conjugate of $M$ to get the sides right...). However this seems to be a very non-unique construction, and likely far too big. The reason I am interested in this is the problem of calculating characteristic classes (a la Connes) for algebras which simply do not have any nicely calculable $n$-cycles. It may be simplest to transfer the bundle to an easier to deal with algebra. (Just as classically we can define a cycle on a manifold by using an embedded submanifold). However then we run into the problem that we often only have CP maps, not algebra maps... I would be grateful for any assistance. 

(Editted: a "weaker" example about $GL_3$ at the end) If I didn't make a mistake in my computation, then the second question doesn't hold for $G=Sp_4$, as it doesn't hold for any $\mathbb{Q}_p$. Allow me to use $F$ as my p-adic field and $k$ its residue field. Let $V/_F$ be spanned by $e_2,e_1,f_1,f_2$ with the symplectic form $(e_i,f_j)=\delta_{ij}$, $(e_i,e_j)=(f_i,f_j)=0$, so that we identify $G(F)=Sp(V)$. The hyperspecial vertices on the building correspond to self-dual lattices of $V$. Let $T$ be the diagonal torus which acts on $V$ by $(c_1,c_2):e_i\mapsto c_ie_i, f_i\mapsto c_i^{-1}f_i$. Let $\pi\in\mathcal{O}_F$ be a fixed uniformizer. Consider the lattices $$\Lambda_{a,b}=\mathcal{O}_F\langle e_2+\pi^{-1} e_1+\pi^{-2}af_1+\pi^{-3}bf_2, e_1+\pi^{-1}f_1+\pi^{-2}(a-1)f_2,f_1-\pi^{-1}f_2,f_2\rangle,$$ where we let $a,b$ runs over a fixed set of representatives of $k$ in $\mathcal{O}_F$. One checks that all $\Lambda_{a,b}$ are in different $T(F)$-orbits by essentially showing that they are in different $T(\mathcal{O}_F)$-orbits. Next one compute the stabilizer of $\Lambda_{a,b}$. What's necessary then is to check the following: Claim. (1) $\text{Stab}_{T(\mathcal{O}_F)}(\Lambda_{a,b})\supset T_3=T(1+\pi^3\mathcal{O}_F)$. (2) If $ab+b-a+1\not\in\pi\mathcal{O}_F$, then $\text{Stab}_{T(\mathcal{O}_F)}(\Lambda_{a,b})\subset T_2=T(1+\pi^2\mathcal{O}_F)$. However, there are only $q+3$ ($q=\#k$) subgroups between $T_2$ and $T_3$. In other words, we have $q^2-q+1$ such lattices, but only $q+3$ possible choices for stabilizers for them; an open compact subgroup of $T(F)$ have to correspond to about $O(q)$ orbits. Note. I did some brute force (using Iwasawa decomp.) and it seems that such an assertion holds for $GL_3$ in most or all cases of $GL_3$. However it also seems to me that if one fix a (semisimple) split rank, then it will be difficult for similar assertion to holds for larger $\dim(G)$; in other words, I'd say such an assertion probably only holds for $GL_n$ (and not for any other classical groups or non-split groups), if it does. -- Editted: Here is an example about $GL_3$ where things fail. Let $T$ again be the diagonal torus. Let $a>0$ be any integer. Consider the two lattices in $F^3$ $$\Lambda_a=\mathcal{O}_F\langle e_1+\pi^{-a}e_2+\pi^{-a}e_3,e_2,e_3\rangle$$ $$\Lambda_a'=\mathcal{O}_F\langle e_1+\pi^{-a}e_3,e_2+\pi^{-a}e_3,e_3\rangle$$ These two lattices correspond to two hyperspecial vertices which are not in the same $T(\mathcal{O}_F)$-orbit and thus $T(F)$-orbit. But they have the same stabilizer $Z(F)\cdot T(1+\pi^a\mathcal{O}_F)$. This is however a weaker example because in this case a stabilizer correspond to $2$ orbits. It's probably the case that for $GL_3$ every possible stabilizer corresponds to at most $2$ orbits, but I have no good intuition about why it should be true. (Note that the number of orbits with distant $r$ from the apartment no longer have a uniform bound independent of $p$.) 

Take $2n$-tuples of bounded positive operators $x_1,\dots x_n$ and $a_1,\dots a_n$ on a Hilbert space $H$ which have zero kernel and dense image and which satisfy the condition that (1) $$ x_1^* x_1+\dots+x_n^* x_n+a_1^* a_1+\dots+a_n^* a_n $$ is invertible and (2) that the image of $x_i^*x_i+a_i^*a_i$ and $x_i^*$ have dense intersection for each $1\le i\le n$ and (3) that we have the equality (used to define a function $T$ of the $2n$-tuple) $$ T:=x_1(x_1^*x_1+a_1^*a_1)^{-1}x_1^*=\dots=x_n(x_n^*x_n+a_n^*a_n)^{-1}x_n^*\in B(H). $$ The problem is to show that $T$ varies continuously as the $2n$-tuple (subject to the conditions) varies continuously in the norm topology. [Edit: Each formula for $T$ is a densely defined operator of norm $\le 1$, and so it extends to a bounded operator on $H$. The problem is that as far as I can see no individual formula can show the continuity of $T$ as the $2n$-tuple varies...] This question may seem strange, but it comes from representing rings of fractions in a Hilbert space. If anyone can say anything about it I would be very grateful! 

In response to Anton for a uniform proof of your formula: note that $K\backslash KaK\cong(a^{-1}Ka\cap K)\backslash K$. Let $\pi:K\rightarrow G(\mathbb{F}_q)$ be the natural quotient map, $K_1:=\ker(\pi)$ and $P:=\pi(a^{-1}Ka\cap K)$. Then $P$ is the $\mathbb{F}_q$-points of the parabolic subgroup of $G$ determined by the walls that $a$ lies on. We have $$|(a^{-1}Ka\cap K)\backslash K|=|P\backslash G(\mathbb{F}_q)|\cdot|(a^{-1}Ka\cap K_1)\backslash K_1|.$$ Let $\mathfrak{K}$ be the Lie algebra of $K$ and likewise for $\mathfrak{K}_1$. Choose Haar measures for the group and Lie algebra so that $\mu(K_1)=\mu(\mathfrak{K}_1)$. Since $a^{-1}Ka\cap K_1$ and $K_1$ are open compact, we have $|(a^{-1}Ka\cap K_1)\backslash K_1|=\mu(a^{-1}Ka\cap K_1)\backslash\mu(K_1)=\mu(a^{-1}\mathfrak{K}a\cap\mathfrak{K}_1)\backslash\mu(\mathfrak{K}_1)=|(a^{-1}\mathfrak{K}a\cap\mathfrak{K}_1)\backslash \mathfrak{K}_1|$. Identifying $a$ as an element in the positive Weyl chamber in the cocharacter lattice, the last term is $q$ to the power of $\sum_{\alpha\in\Phi^+}\max(\langle a,\alpha\rangle-1,0)$, while the roots of $P$ are those $\alpha\in\Phi$ with $\langle a,\alpha\rangle\le 0$. 

Given a positive (or completely positive map) $\phi:A\to B$ between C* algebras, is there a way to construct an $A-B$ bimodule? This would more or less generalise the following construction: If $\phi$ was an algebra map, we could have ${}_\phi B$, which is $B$ as a vector space, with $B$ product as the right $B$ action, and left action $a. b=\phi(a) b$. If there was a Hilbert C* module, so much the better. (This is part of the idea that bimodules generalise algebra maps, and I want to look at the differentiable properties of bimodules.) 

For a divisor in a complex manifold, what is known about a complementary bundle to the divisor in the manifold (either for the tangent or the cotangent bundle). Is there a description in terms of holomorphic line bundles? For a Kahler manifold it would be possible just to take the normal bundle, and split this into two line bundles over the divisor by taking the eigenspaces of the complex structure map $J$ (hope I got this right). But then what properties do these line bundles have, and how do they relate to the properties of the divisor? As a learner in algebraic geometry, is there somewhere to look to find out about this? Secondly an apology, I am definitely not an expert in algebraic geometry so I apologise if the answer is well known (it likely is) or if my question is confused (especially the latter)! I will have to explain where it is from: I would like to look at divisors on a noncommutative complex manifold. In noncommutative differential geometry ideas of rank or codimension are rather difficult, and in general require adding extra structure. (Understandably, textbooks on classical 'commutative' manifolds are happy simply saying complex codimension one, as there is not any problem in that case.) However the rank one case (line bundles) is known in noncommutative geometry - they have several definitions as invertible bimodules, self Morita equivalences and as integer graded Hopf Galois extensions. Even the idea of 'rank 2' is rather difficult to pin down, thus my wish to try to `define' codimension one by having a complementary bundle described in terms of line bundles of known properties. 

Lusztig defined (in Sec. 5, also Sage) a Springer action of the affine Weyl group on the homology of affine Springer fibers (Iwahori one, i.e. in an affine flag variety). In the regular semisimple unramified case, Goresky, Kottiwtz and MacPherson had a formula (14.4) for this action assuming the homology is pure, for example in the equal valuation case, where they said 

Let $G$ be an connected reductive group over finite field $k$. I will assume that $\text{char}(k)$ is very good for $G$ (or even larger, if preferred). Let $B\subset G$ be a Borel subgroup defined over $k$. Let $\mathfrak{h}\subset\text{Lie }G$ be a subspace such that $\mathfrak{h}\supset\text{Lie }B$ and $\text{Ad}(B)\mathfrak{h}=\mathfrak{h}$. Take any regular semisimple $X\in(\text{Lie }G)(k)$. Consider $$\mathcal{H}_{X,\mathfrak{h}}=\{g\in B\backslash G\,|\,\text{Ad}(g)X\in\mathfrak{h}\}.$$ Over $\bar{k}$, $\mathcal{H}_{X,\mathfrak{h}}$ has a stratification by affine spaces, given by first conjugate $X$ into a maximal torus $T\subset B$, then intersect $\mathcal{H}_{X,\mathfrak{h}}$ with the Schubert cells $B\backslash BwB$ for $w\in N_G(T)/T$. However this doesn't work over $k$ if $X$ does not centralize a maximal split torus. Question: Any method to count $\mathcal{H}_{X,\mathfrak{h}}(k)$? A naive try of mine was to just look at the Frobenius action on "Schubert cells", but it seems that Frobenius can send a Schubert cell to a "non-Schubert cell," i.e. to some cell that is not a Schubert cell from any pair of $(B^*,T^*)$. The motivation is that such counting problems simply appear if one wants to count points on affine Springer fibers, or more generally, compute $p$-adic orbital integral. 

Take a noncommutative noetherian domain $R$ and a multiplicative subset $X$ (say just non zero elements of $R$). The standard construction gives a ring of quotients $RX{}^{-1}$, and I am looking at modules over $RX{}^{-1}$. From these module constructions we can define a certain subring $S$ with $R\subseteq S \subset RX{}^{-1}$. Now $S$ depends on the construction, and in particular it is not obvious whether $R=S$ in various cases, but I have questions about the subring in general: 1) Is there a classification of the subrings $S$? 2) Are there any standard methods to show when $S$ is itself a noetherian domain? 3) Is there any criterion which can be used to determine when $S=R$? One thing which can be assumed about the $S$ which I have is that they do not contain any $x{}^{-1}$ for which $x\in X$ was not already invertible in $R$. Basically I am asking if anyone has looked at the classification or properties of subrings $R\subseteq S \subset RX{}^{-1}$ in any detail. My guess is probably, and I apologies in advance for not being an expert in ring theory (the motivation comes from $C^*$ algebras).
