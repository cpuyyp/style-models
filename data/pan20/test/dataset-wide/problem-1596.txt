Every mechanical engine, gasoline, diesel or other (such as LNG) is made up of a multitude of parts manufactured to accepted engineering "standards." These standards spell out, down to the smallest detail, what engineering criteria the finished part will meet. Quite frequently however these individual parts come from different factories and various countries. But because each manufacturer subscribes to the same engineering standards, a wrist pin manufactured in Korea will mate to a piston manufactured in India for example. So far, so good. There is, however, the rub called "Manufacturing tolerances." Which are accepted as a necessity in the above engineering standards. Thus, the commercially produced wrist pin made above may be allowed to have a circumference + or - variance of say .0005" to .0009", it will still function for its intended purpose and meet the manufacturers requirement for MTBF (Mean Time Between Failure). The cost to get that same part to be dead-on perfect, with absolutely minimal deviation from its design specification would drive the cost much higher than the intended market (you and me) could afford. That's one reason why the engine in a Lamborghini, Aventador Roadster costs so much more than the powerhouse of a Chevrolet Corvette: Manufacturing tolerances (i.e. variations from the design) in the Lambo are almost non-existent. All of which Which leads us to: Breaking in a new engine! Let's say you could only afford the Corvette and not the Lambo, but you want your prized beauty to last a long, long time... What do you do? You break the darn thing in properly of course! Here's the engineering reason: All those parts in your new engine manufactured to that above mentioned +or- tolerance need to mate to each other (think of it as dating before marriage). Every part, commercially machined has microscopic hi and low spots on its surface called "asperities." These asperities need to rub against each other under load in order to literally break off the high spots and bring the load bearing surfaces closer to the ultimate goal of 100% contact. The other element is called "wear hardening." Piston rings, cylinder walls and camshafts along with many crank shafts in most non-exotic, passenger vehicle engines are made from nodular cast iron. IF these cast iron parts are allowed to break in properly, they will develop an extremely hard, long lasting wear surface. It may only be .001" to .003" or so thick, but it will stand up to many years of use. This all happens on a microscopic level of course. But I guarantee you that, as they came from the factory, the rings to cylinder wall contact and the cam lobe to lifter contact etc on your new Corvette were NOT optimal for (a) full performance and (b) engine longevity. Breaking it in carefully will, however accomplish this. Recommended break in procedures vary by manufacturer, but essentially it boils down to a few basics: (1) NEVER rev a cold engine! (2) Vary your speeds for the first 500 miles and don't maintain a constant speed (like 60 MPH) for extended periods. (3) In the first 500 miles, accelerate evenly and allow your engine to coast frequently (i.e. coast from 60 to 50 foot off he gas). This creates a high vacuum in the combustion chamber and pulls more fresh oil to the rings ad cylinder walls. (4) Change your oil and filter after the first 100 miles and again at 500 miles. (5) Only use high quality oil, preferably synthetic. I've rebuilt many types of engines and some of them exceeded 150,000 miles on that rebuild. Break an engine in right, treat it good and it will last you a long time. 

Yes, Twitter confirmed it was doing it. This was posted from the Twitter account of the man who made the video and the response he got. 

That's a little less than 2 pages per legal entity, assuming 1000 pages. In all likelihood it's more. 

The amount of carbon dioxide is cyclical, and has changed drastically over the history of the earth. But it's true that C02 used to be much higher: Wattsupwiththat 

While not necessarily registered Democrats, the ex-felon population is inclined to vote for them and overwhelmingly register for them. And while the study only included 3 states, those states were rather diverse. There is little to no reason to not take the results at face value. While such quibbles detract from the full, 100% accuracy of Cruz's comments, even Politifact found no fault with the study itself, nor with the general gist of Cruz's comments. They admitted so in their findings. Politifact is not a reliable source of information. Link 

It's directionally accurate. CNS news found that 2184 Syrians had been resettled here since 2011. 2098 were Muslim and just 53 (2.4%) were Christian, although Christians are 10% of the population at large and more likely to be refugees because of persecution by ISIS. See here, here, and here. In 2016 over 10,000 Syrian refugees were settled in the US, but I could not find their religion breakdown. If anyone has a more current view, please add. I would also add that the law requires consideration of religious persecution for refugee status. The city of Aleppo is believed to have the largest number of Christians in Syria. Aleppo has been ground zero for ethnic cleansing and the war in general between 2012-2016. 

This really could be two questions. First we have the image of Trump and May holding hands in this article in the Telegraph. Then they claim from an unsourced insider: 

The Scripps University Geoscience Research Division has similar results still: Link, see chart on the right which benefit from having margins of error. 500 million years ago the Earth experienced significantly more carbon dioxide versus the 400 ppm or so today. 

John Holland in "Hidden Order" and "Emergence" and Stuart Koffman in "At Home in the Universe" explore these concepts further. The point being that as long acid strains and other life building block components build connections, the probability of life increases dramatically to a point that it becomes almost a certainty. So it's not chance. Indeed closed systems that have energy supplied will produce complexity as a way to dissipate that energy, as required by the 2nd law of Thermodynamics. This disentropy, or complexity for free, is a foundational view of how life is created. Sorry cannot find a small quote from them that encapsulates this thinking.
