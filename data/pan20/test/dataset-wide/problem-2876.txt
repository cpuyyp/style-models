But the actual details of your logic system will make a massive difference to whether this kind of proof will work. E: Now that we do have the specifics of the system, you could do it like this: 

I think some Frege/Hilbert ideas might help in making progress on this question, since in many ways, the Frege-Hilbert Correspondences were about this very issue of the nature of mathematical axioms and what proofs using them are really about. Let's suppose we have a piece of logical syntax constituting an axiom, and a rule of inference that tells you something you can do with this axiom to derive a theorem. Awesome. But what comes next is the question of what kind of mathematical structure this system of inference amounts to. Do we have a Boolean or Heyting Algebra? Do we have a Topos? Do we have a transitive set model? Here is a model that might completely encapsulate your proposed logical system - the ordered sequence of natural numbers. We have a base zero value ($$$), and a successor operation (adding a $). Since we have this structure already (the numbers 0,1,2,3, ... and so on), there doesn't seem to be any problem whatsoever with saying that your proposed inference scheme is also well founded. Now this may not necessarily be your intended model, but syntactically, there's nothing obvious in your formulation to say there's anything wrong with it as an interpretation. Maybe seeing your axiom/rule framework as a subsystem of Peano Arithmetic might help you find out interesting properties and theorems you might not have considered otherwise. On the other hand, if you want to be more specific about a structure you're interested in, you might consider adding more axioms or rules to home in on the particular behaviour or resources of your model. Now let's pull it back a bit - if your inference system is fine because it's somehow "not new" relative to our current counting systems, then what is it that makes these pre-existing counting systems or more general mathematical theories okay? The axioms that we take to inform us about number theories tell us something valuable about what it is to count, multiply, factorize etc., and this gives us a practical way of agreeing on answers to outstanding questions of applied practical use in physics, engineering, and even in more abstract ideas of strategic planning and modelling. But why should we agree on them? Well, I think there're two diverging strands on what it is about our axiomatic systems of mathematics that makes them foundational. The first is to say that in building axiomatic theories and individuating structures exemplifying the axioms we're investigating, what we're doing is describing and inventing a variety of abstract technologies that may (or may not) be useful in whatever contexts we want to apply them in. Mathematics brings a series of tools that might work very broadly and successfully, and that many things in nature and our lives are apt to be reasoned with using the technologies that we invent and apply. This is (a very broad-stroke version of) David Hilbert's perspective, because the mathematician is not specifically aiming at Truth-in-the-world in doing their reasoning, but more just at delving into and unpacking the internal definitions and relations of the different parts of the technologies they're creating. The second is to focus particularly on certain central theories that have proven to work well, and to develop our understanding of those theories with a view to explaining a core underlying body of mathematical facts. We don't seem to have many different number theories in practical use - we have one notion of what it means to be a number , and a simple fact of the matter that . Maybe this tells us something about the general structure of human cognition, or maybe it just tells us something about how the world itself is actually composed of things satisfying a certain structural regularity that we can latch on to; either way, there is some kind of phenomenon that mathematics is trying to be a scientific theory of, and uncovering the nature of that structure is what mathematicians try to achieve in proving theorems in certain accepted fields of mathematical interest. This is more like Gottlob Frege's view, in that mathematical Truth really is out there, and mathematicians are doing their empiricist duty to investigate and test it. In either case, what's going on is that we're not "just" drawing out cute syntactic relationships. There is some kind of mathematical structuring, relevant to the cognitive power that maths gives us across the other fields of study and practice, that goes into why some inference rules and axioms are accepted and worked with. Understanding logic is about getting a feel for these structures, where they might be usefully employed and their consequences and limitations. Is there an "absolute Truth" notion here? I don't see why either Frege or Hilbert need deny that there is - for Frege, mathematical Truth comes from the role of mathematical abstraction in scientific practice, and for Hilbert, mathematical Truth is about its own systems and formalisms, so both can claim a kind of strict truthfulness in mathematical assertions. 

And these two coexist perfectly happily with one another, because the implication can still obtain even if nothing does in fact Quineize. This field of ideas is explored in the concept of Trans-world Identities - it too has quite a few problems, but if treated formally rigorously, it promises to avoid a lot of the sources of Willard's strictures against modal involvement. 

Atheism, read in a particular way, has no consolations at all. That's nothing to say of the sort of atheism that people like Dawkins and Hitchens defend, where one posits a (perhaps Hegelian?) view of free and rational humans progressing towards an end paradise of scientifically informed harmony - you can completely see why that might be consoling to some people. On Jean-Paul Sartre's conception, Atheism is nothing more or less than the recognition that God does not exist. God, here, is not to be understood through the lens of any particular faith or belief system, or of a personal psychological representation or theory acquired through language, social graces or instinctive defense mechanism. God, in Sartre's view, is the possibility of direction external to the unframed plane of our existence. Atheism is to be read as the understanding that Nature and Cosmology do not care about you, and that its principles and functioning are not going to be simply presented to you to follow for some positive end. Consolation isn't found in Atheism as such. Existentialism qua Sartre is a view of human existence as theorising about what we and others do and must do to live on in spite of the truth of Atheism. This creates a space for a certain amount of "authentic" faith, that recognises the instrumental nature of the mythologies and principles of our social realities, opening up new spaces for similar constructions and organization, and yet chooses to participate in them despite their constructed or mythological nature as a way of surviving in an ambivalent reality. We're finding this a lot in ideas in post-structural Christianity, and there is an interesting argument to be made to the effect that Atheism does not necessarily conflict with the idea of religious belief, even where we recognise that it does crucially oppose both the moral normativity and the metaphysical claims of pretty much every religion or cult that currently exists. 

A simple answer would be to say that the Soul historically is whatever part of a person there might be that is not their body. Yet why should we think that Souls should be taken to exist, and whether Souls could be Christian or moral or anything else? Michel Foucault, in his Discipline and Punish (1977), presents a genealogical analysis of his society's view on behavioural deviance and its responses to it. Early on in the work, Foucault presents before us an interpretation of his work which I find compelling: 

There appears to be an issue of Referential Opacity going on here. Which is of course rather apt, given your choice of subject. First off, though, let's get the technical point out of the way: you need to use predicate logic rather than purely propositional logic in order to make progress here. What you seem to be doing is using a constant term Quine and having it feature in two modal claims. Ideally, your two premises will look something like the following:
