This one has been bothering me for a while. Because of the strict diets, almost nobody who's training is allowed to drink any alcohol. A couple of my friends have turned to marijuana to get that Friday night high. Now I am wondering, what impact does marijuana have on the progress of the user? 

I've got a quite intense body transformation coming up, and it is quite time consuming. Therefore I have finally decided I need to get rid of my worst habit - oversleeping. It seems, that every time I get the chance (free days, Saturdays, Sundays) it is quite common for me to sleep anywhere from 10-15 hours per night, and it is starting to take its toll. That means, that in any given day, I am losing 2-7 hours of valuable workout/study/work time, which is no more fine by me. So the question: How do I get rid of oversleeping? Some background info: I am a freelance programmer therefore I spend quite a lot of time at a computer. I also study IT, so a bit more time is spent sitting. I currently don't work out at a gym, but have quite intense (3h+) dance practices 2x a week, so I'm not also completely sedentary. I am also a bit overweight, therefore the transformation. I am not currently on any diet per-se, but I try to keep things balanced. In regards to sleep, because of work, there are times (about 1x a week) when I have to work really late, like 4am, and get up at 6am for studies. 

The galaxy gear actually links to your phone and can't do much without it (certainly not GPS), so it's not going to solve your problem with carrying your phone around. I believe the MIO alpha strapless monitor might be the sort of thing you are looking for ... there a review of it here. But that still won't give you GPS. GPS watches are rather pricey and ugly. 

Strength training will improve your cardio fitness above no training at all, but it won't be very good compared to actual cardio training. In order to improve your cardio fitness you need to push your pulmonary/cardiovascular system past its comfort zone just like you push your muscular/skeletal system to improve your strength. The problem with strength training is that you do not sustain higher heart rates for very long periods of time (during the lifting) and allow too much rest in between while you allow your muscle to recover. You can convince yourself of that by wearing a heart rate monitor during training. You'll probably discover that your average rate during a session is not very high and that your rate only spikes for very short periods during lifts. To really improve your cardio fitness you need to sustain high heart rate for reasonable periods of time. HIIT is a good way to maximize the return of any time spent doing cardio work. Keep in mind that cardio work might require you to adjust your diet a bit to ensure you replenish your glycogen levels adequately. 

A while back I read in the Bodybuilding Bible, that if you are able to read while doing cardio - You're doing it wrong!. Now since then, I've always kinda smiled to myself at the gym, when seeing someone reading while doing cardio, thinking - "I'm probably doing much better than they are, losing more fat". But today I saw a video of Kris Gething, where he actually promotes reading as a way to pass time. So, what is it: Is reading good or bad for your cardio training? 

Ok, You asked for it :) Looking at this from the theory standpoint. Fat loss Loosing fat in a matter of weeks is possible. That much is certain and, as Natasha mentioned, a kethogenic or hgc diet could do it (with a BIG emphasis on could) Muscle gain Now here we get to the part where it gets complicated. A drastic fat cut means leaving out some nutrients nutrients and/or doing excessive amounts of cardio activities. Doing anyone of those means, that there is either less material for the muscles to work with, or the musscles are more fatigued to begin with, and the muscle gain, while not out of the question, will not be drastic. So, in resume: BOTH cutting fat drastically and building muscle at the same time is not viable. The way movie stars and such do it, is by gaining muscle first, and then drastically cutting, usually by means of extensive cardio, carb depletion and the sort, which is all fine and dandy in the short run, but not healthy at all in the long run. 

If the cable machine you use more than one pulley wheel, then your not lifting the full weight (see Wikipedia). Unless you manage to get the cable almost vertical, you are not displacing the weight as much on a cable machine and so not producing the same amount of work (see more wikipedia). Don't forget to count the weight of the bar on the Smith machine! 

It all comes down to the speed at which your body can process the sugar. Simple sugars make it into you blood stream very quickly and so you should avoid them unless you are exercising while consuming them ... or else they will have to be converted to glycogen, or even fat. Complex carbs take a lot more work/time to be processed and released as simple sugar into the bloodstream, and so provide your body with energy without the spike you mentioned. There's definitely been a degree of overcompensation against carbs in recent years after a lot of anti-fat rhetoric. I think bundling complex carbs together with added refined sugars in the "bad for you" category is a similar mistake to the "All fats are unhealthy" of the past. Here is the NHS advice on carbs: $URL$ 

So I am on this 12 week transformation by Kris Gethin, and I am supposed to do 20mins of cardio twice a day, every day. So I'm thinking of alternatives of climbing stairs, running ,etc. So I thought - could sex be a form of cardio? Having sex for 20mins twice a day would be waaaay more pleasant and not as monotonous as running :) 

I have this problem. Since I'm a dancer, but I'm also a tad bit overweight, the strain on my knee joints and ligaments is a little bit bigger than it should be. So, a while ago I started feeling pain in Patellar ligament, or to be more specific, in the place where it connects to the bone. The doc told me to abstain from dancing for a while, while I reduce my weight, but this is not possible, since a competition is coming up. Some elastic binding do help with the pain. But I also think, that a possible cause for this pain is not stretching the ligament enough before a practice, so my question is this: How do I warm up my Patellar ligament? What are some stretching exercises for this, without a lot of equipment? I have a ballet bar, a floor, and some people, that can help me stretch, and that is about it. Also, it's not like I haven't tried to find something for this, I just can't think of anything.
