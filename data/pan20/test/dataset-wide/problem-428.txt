Or more simply put, you need materials to experiment on, tools to experiment with, and scientists to do the actual research and develop the goods. I imagine that any "elite" group of people is very, very, very rich. So a lab and shell companies that buy a truckload of supplies more or less each month are easily set up. But the brainpower, that's a tricky one. Academics is based on peer research. You (for the academics here, I hope I got it right) spend your life working in a field, trying to find out why something works why it does. A lot of time goes into this. You work based on the research of others - others that have researched the things you research before. Academics is a culture based on sharing. This contradicts the culture where an elite group secretly has superior tech. Communication enables sharing. Thus, for this to be viable, you'll have to take away communication. This could work in 1950, but in modern times, I don't think it's viable anymore. Nearly everybody in developed countries carries a camera and a global communication device. 

Radiation is a scary thing, but it's just one example you could use. I don't think scarcity of resources will work out, unless you create some mystery "Resource X" that is A) Scarce and B) needed. Iridium would do nicely if you want to use existing resources. Wikipedia lists Iridium consumption as 10 tonnes in 2010. That's not a whole lot, and if the rockets or the supplies needed it, you'd find Earth significantly lacking it. But again, you run into the issues 

There are really only 3 social roles a society needs to be successful 1 - Farm/gatherer class these will be your society's food producers. For example, they could grow food and develop long sharp claws for harvesting, they could be gatherers with strong skeletal structures for supporting heavy loads, or even be photosynthetic and generate fruit-like things over time. 2 - Builder class this class will be responsible for constructing your society's buildings, maintaining existing structures, etc. They should have dexterous appendages to manipulate building materials such as wood planks or stone blocks, and should also be able to lift heavy loads and collect these materials (strong skeleton, maybe one or more arms solely designed to chop down trees or cut stone). 3 - Warrior class: these would be the members of society responsible for protecting your society from outside invaders. They should be resilient to damage, with maybe a tough exoskeleton or a thick hide, preferably resistant to temperature changes both hot and cold. Now, depending on how advanced you want your society to be you could develop sub-classes for each grouping. For example, a sub-builder class that can mine for iron ore or rare materials, or a sub-warrior class that can take on aerial enemies with wings and honeycombed bones. And if you want to get really advanced, you could have certain organisms with larger than usual brain capacity and a degree of autonomy from the hive mind, allowing them to learn and design new ways for the hive to operate (think engineers to design new buildings or scientists to design new weapons). 

What I'm thinking for this question is that some kind of filter is put around the sun by aliens that prevents some kinds of solar energy from passing through but allows other types. Like if it stopped visible light but allowed UV. Is there any way that the parts of light plants need for photosynthesis can be separated from visible light, allowing the plants to survive but preventing visible light from passing through? I've tried to do my own research on this, but all I've found is that they require a nonspecific "light", and I'm not sure if this means specifically visible light or all kinds of light, such as UV. For the question, assume that the barrier around the Earth can sort between different types of light, regardless of whether or not this makes any sense. EDIT: Close voters, I understand my question may be slightly difficult to understand due to the nature of what I am asking, however reading the answers below should allow you to see what I am looking for, and show that there are others who understood the question even if you didn't. 

Human disease will only affect humans. You might think a disease would spread rampantly among an alien population considering the effects Smallpox had on the south american natives when they were exposed to it. And while this is a perfectly reasonable assumption, it's also incorrect. It is almost impossible for there to be any human diseases that can affect the alien at all. The reason for this is that human diseases evolved to infect humans. Alien Cells would be too different from Human Cells for any disease to attempt to infect. For example, a Plant can't catch Smallpox from you. And while there is some precedent for cross-species infections as has been the case on Earth, these have been between animals that share a relatively recent common ancestor, like Cats and Humans, or Birds and Humans. This is why I said "almost" impossible, because there is a tiny, tiny chance it is compatible, but this is less likely (and less plausible) as winning the Lottery every time for about 100 years. But that doesn't mean that there's no way for you to make it plausible. Using something like the Panspermia theory, you could have the two species share a common ancestor, which would massively raise the odds of an infection. War of the Worlds can be considered incredibly inaccurate. Until, that is, you consider the theory that the Martians and the Humans are biologically connected from a common ancestor, which makes it just slightly more likely, and into the realm of plausibility. 

Allow me to make some generalizations, so that I may reduce innovative "power" by showing how these groups of people don't have a reason or don't have the means to advance research. 

This is all a "maybe if" statement, though. Humans are such curious beings. Personally, I think that what you propose can't happen - there'll always be some people who will try to find out the workings of the universe, and magic will just be integrated with that. It might go at a slower progress, however. A slower rate of technological progress is also not too strange. They won't stay stuck at the middle ages, but I could see the middle ages stretching a couple thousand years. 

If you place your colonies further away, you could argue that there is a resource (resource X) that allows fast rockets. Resource X is troublesome to excavate, polluting, rare, expensive... you name it. Imagine resource X to be of nuclear origin, but 10x all it's factors and you get something that's pretty nasty. You still need an opponent, though. If me donating you goods costs me a lot, I might just stop. What's preventing me from stopping with sending you goods? Death of a colony? Then why are the people angry? Surely they understand? The idea is workable, but you need another source of conflict. Ecological conflict on a small scale is usually people not wanting to pay for getting rid of their trash properly, so they just dump it. Maybe there's one continent responsible for the colonies and it's polluting the world with the constant rocket launches using Resource X. Background radiation levels are on the rise. Radiation chart: (For better viewing, I recommend the original on XKCD) Basically, the "daily dose" of 10 micro Sv is already increased to 50 micro Sv, and in the future it looks like it will go up to 100 micro Sv and 250 micro Sv. Now, this doesn't seem bad, but the radiation gets in the food, and the water, and slowly the whole world is poisoned. 

You say you want to go with something accidental, but you can take it even further. What if some people do something they think is helping and it causes catastrophic failure. Imagine this: A private software firm develops a new program for power grid management. You may or may not be aware of this, but most power grids need constant maintenance to balance supply and demand of power. Too much provided, and the grid shorts. Too little supplied, and systems shut down. As a result, the power plants for each regions grid are constantly changing output. It is inefficient and relies nearly exclusively on human influence. Water flow through dams, burn rate for coal plants, and number of cells active in nuclear plants are all dependent on people, with very little computer influence. What if that changed? What if our software company found a way for a computer to observe supply and demand for power and learn when and why to adjust output, adapting to all forms of generation. This company would instantly become rich, as energy firms seek to use their hopefully patented tech. It starts small, taking root in cities first and then is applied to nationwide grids. It is amazingly effective, causing the energy industry to reduce failures and increase reliability. BUT THEN It was a simple mistake. The software firm is working on an update to their system, one that energy firms are deadly waiting for. When it comes out, all of them want it, and they allow some of their newly computerized systems to accept the update and all goes smoothly. They wait a week, a month maybe. All seems well. So, they push the update to more systems it until all of their grids use it. After all, if it didn't fail within a month, it must be safe. And it was, for a time. But unknown to all, there is a glitch in the update, a miswritten definition in one of the program's library files. This particular file isn't called on by the main function very often, so the glitch remained unnoticed. Then, one day, catastrophic power failures everywhere. Coal plants stop working. Dams are frozen at their current flow rate. Nuclear plants completely shut down, their cells grow cold. The lights go out. The world is dark. Basically this idea depends on a glitch in computerized grid maintenance causing a global shutdown. This idea, scarily enough, is plausible even today. I'm sure the energy industry would love a way to manage the grid without constant human attention, and a bad update is something everyone deals with eventually, from iPhones whose hardware can no longer handle the new iOS to government websites with broken links. Hope this helps. 

People are lazy and will use any means that doesn't take too much effort at their disposal to do a task in a simpler manner. Academics are interested in the workings of something, and will dedicate time towards discovering how it works and how to apply this knowledge. We need to find a way to stop both of these archetypes from progressing technology. The people If magic can be shaped to one's will, then some of the hard work might be made easier through the use of magic. This leads to a less pressing need to come up with an easier method. Unless magic is expensive, it comes with the convenience of being always available. Physical, technological objects tend to lack this property. An example of this convenience would be a remote control in our world: when one doesn't have to get up to perform an action, there's no pressing need to invent. 

Academics What could make curious people stop looking? Stigmas, perhaps. But looking at our scientific history... In 1667, there was the idea that there were spirits in substances. They called them Phlogiston. The wikipedia article contains the following excerpt: 

Before I go on, there's something else that needs to be addressed: Why do we reach medieval technology at all? Well, personally, I believe that even with magic, the feudal system will still occur. It is this feudal system that brings the technologies. A landlord may dictate how the land must be farmed; after all, if lands cultivated in manner X are more productive than lands cultivated in manner Y, then perhaps all lands should be cultivated in manner X. Why one would smelt iron and develop tools, I don't know. Perhaps because controlling fire doesn't help with farming land. So some still need tools. 

State-Sanctioned Divine Beings Short answer: No These divine beings aren't the church, the church is simply an organization that worships them. The beings themselves are separate entities, and as a result contracting them should have no legal implications in terms of separation of church and state. This only changes if the beings are a part of the leadership structure of the church itself. For example, if an Angel holds an official position of power in the church equivalent to a bishop or priest. Weaponized Priesthood Short answer: No, but only if they are being contracted like mercenary groups This part of the answer is a simple one. If they're being given specific contracts as if they were mercenaries, then this is no violation. This isn't a violation because they're never becoming a part of the state itself. If they are official government employees, however, then this is a violation. These are official parts of the church that are also official parts of the government, and this is a violation of church and state. However... As Daron's answer has indicated, there's no law that enforces a separation of church and state. This answer is more of a guide of things that are and aren't violating the concept of separation of Church and State, which while it might not be useful for the legal aspects of your world, might be useful for the societal impacts. 

There are a couple ways you could do this: Option 1: Go far away Hyfnae's answer touched on this, but if you hide yourself well enough, and do so on a planet far enough away from this society (you said they only found most of the universe, after all), you can avoid detection for a long time. However, once the society's surveillance stations come your way, your activities will need to be downsized immediately. Even if you've hidden your labs well enough to avoid detection, if life on your planet starts evolving too fast or changing too rapidly you will draw more attention than you want. As a result, another option (my favorite) would be to . . . Option 2: Bring in more people What if your conspiracy included not only biologists, but some builders and surveyors as well? You could arrange to construct a surveillance station near the planet(s) you want to work with, and make sure that its leaders are fellow conspirators. Then, you would have nearly unlimited creative control on the planets around the station, as your planets can't be discovered by a society that thinks it already discovered them! Option 3: Change society The final option I can see would be to convince this society that "messing in god-like affairs" is not something to be banned, but embraced. After all, you aid that these immortals get bored of their immortal lifespans, so they build structures spanning entire solar systems. Your conspirators could simply pitch their activities as another way to ease the boredom. To make their case better, they could propose to use a lifeless planet and artificially terraform it. Where's the harm in messing with life that would never have existed in the first place? While this option, if successful, would be the best way to play God without fear of getting caught (society already knows about and agrees to your work) I can see how it would make for such an interesting story. However, I can see an interesting dynamic whereby most conspirators try to hide their activities and a few try to make it socially acceptable. These few would risk exposing the conspiracy, and might become the target of a space-age hitman. Hope this helps!
