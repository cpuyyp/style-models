The diffraction limit of telescope optics, for apertures large compared to the wavelength of light, is inversely proportional to the diameter of the aperture. See the relevant Wikipedia page. For moderate to large telescopes with simple optics this resolution limit is usually not realisable due to seeing. The seeing limit is due to thermal inhomogeneity and turbulence in the atmosphere between the telescope and the target. See this Sky at Night page. To some extent the seeing limit can be overcome using adaptive optics. See the relevant Wikipedia page. 

The idea of magnification is not relevant to astro-photography, what is relevant is the image scale. The image scale depends on the focal length of the objective and the size of the sensor. The Barlow effectively modifies the focal length, so if you have a $B\times$ Barlow and an objective of focal length $f_O$ the effective focal length is $f_e=B\times f_O$. If your sensor has side of length $l$ then the field of view that corresponds to that side is (in radian) $\theta_{rad}=l/f_e$ or in degrees $\theta_{deg}=(l/f_e)\times(180/\pi)$ So if your sensor has a short side length of $\approx 0.015 \mbox{m}$ and a the telescope has a focal length of $1.2 \mbox{m}$ and you are using a $\times2$ Barlow you have the short side of the image corresponds to a field of view of $\approx 21$ minutes of arc. 

When the cloud finally collapses, it forms a star and shortly after planets. However, angular momentum is always conserved. That's why planets all follow the same orbit, and why almost all of them rotate in the same direction. There's nothing to turn them the other direction, so they will continue spinning in the same direction as the original gas cloud. There are a few exceptions, though. Whenever objects formed in such a way that sent them orbiting the opposite direction, they usually collided with objects going in the same direction as the original cloud. This destroyed any outlying objects or sent them in the same direction as the original cloud. Still, two huge exceptions are planets Venus and Uranus. Uranus spins on an axis of almost 90-degrees (on its side). Venus meanwhile spins the opposite direction as Earth and the other planets. In both cases there is strong evidence that these planets were struck by large objects at some point in the distant past. The impacts were large enough to overcome the angular momentum of the bodies, and give them a different spin. There are also a range of other theories; for example, some astronomers think that Venus may have been flipped upside-down. Point is, there were irregular events that happened to both of these planets. 

The Sun is not dying when the Earth supposedly becomes uninhabitable, it is just getting hotter as it evolves on the main sequence (core hydrogen burning, the Sun has something like 5+ billion years before reaching the red giant stage of its evolution)). It will continue to get more luminous and at a guess if Mars could be made habitable it would remain so for millions, possibly another billion years. But then do you really think humanity (or rather our descendant civilization/s) if it survives for another billion years will need a planetary surface to survive? 

We can measure absolute motion, as this is motion with respect to the CMB, and what do you know, they both move (the Sun and the Earth). 

Ceres varies between mag 9.3 and mag 6.7 which are below the nominal naked eye limiting magnitude of ~5. The gain in limiting magnitude for something like 10x50 binoculars (~4.5 magnitudes) would bring Ceres even at its faintest above the limiting magnitude of about 9.5. 

The atmoshere on Pluto will have very little effect on the apparent size of the Sun, It is negligable compared to that on Earth ($\sim 0.3-1.0 \mbox{ Pa}$ compared to $\sim 10^5 \mbox{ Pa}$, approximately the air pressure at 100 km on the Earth). Now angular size is proportional to the ratio of the objects diameter to its range. At the Earth's distance ($1 \mbox{ AU}$) the Sun subtends about $30'$ of arc. So at Pluto (as it is at a distance from the Sun of between $26.7 \mbox{AU}$ and $49.3 \mbox{AU}$ depending on where in its orbit it is) the Sun will subtend between $30/26.7\approx 1.1'$ and $30/49.3\approx 0.6'$ of arc. Which is close to the resolution of the human eye corresponding to 20/20 vision. 

Magnetic fields play a role in gamma-ray bursts (GRB) because you have a star that is collapsing into a black hole the magnetic fields serve to funnel a small portion of material into two jets coming out of the poles. If the jet happens to be pointing in the direction of the Earth, we see a very bright light source and that's what we call a GRB. Clearly none of this has any analog in the Big Bang. 

All telescopes make images look upside down. This is just the nature of mirrors. You are right that equatorial mounts are more difficult to use. To ease the frustration, I suggest you just stop worrying about the mount and just point the telescope manually. You can start with easier targets and gradually try to find more difficult ones: 1) The easiest target is the moon. Just place the telescope on the floor with no concern for alignment and aim it at the moon. Look for craters. 2) After the moon, try to find binary stars. The easier pair to see is Mizar and Alcor, which are a pair of stars in the Big Dipper. Again, just point the telescope manually. Then gradually learn about more binary stars (I really like Albireo). Use the free planetarium software Stellarium to help you find them. 3) After binary stars, try to find the moons of Jupiter. This is more difficult because Jupiter moves in the sky, but it is also very rewarding. You will definitely need Stellarium to tell you when/where to find Jupiter. Later in the future you can return to trying to setup the equatorial mount. The only advantage of setting up the mount correctly is that you can then have the telescope track the sky for you. It's a nice feature, but one that you can survive without. 

Can they see the stars? If not then motion is undetectable in a closed environment as it would constitute an inertial frame. But even if they could see the "stars" presumably these would be generated by some form of display technology and behave consistently with the supposed mission profile. However acceleration is detectable, it would manifest as a gravity like force. The way gravity varies withing the environment could indicate that this was a planetary field rather than an artificial one (depending on how the artificial gravity is supposedly generated). I would expect the payload will have been told some story that would explain this away though. 

Since the rate of lengthening of the day on Mars is three orders of magnitude less than that of the Earth for a first go at calculating how long it will be before the day lengths are equal we can ignore the change in day length on Mars. The difference in day lengths is $\approx 40$ minutes. The Earths day lengthens by $\approx 1.7$ ms/100 years. Therefore the day lengths will be equal in: $\frac{40\times 60}{1.7\times 10^{-3}}\times 100 \approx 141 \times 10^6$ years 

The Big-Bang was not an explosion in empty space. Inter-galactic space is not empty, there is an inter-galactic medium, gas clouds and material ejected from galaxies, including stars and possibly globular clusters, by various mechanisms... 

If we take a look at a logarithmic scale of the Solar System, there appears to be a large gap between the heliopause and the Oort cloud: 

As I see it, most of the stars in the galactic bulge are Population I stars. However, as one moves farther from the galactic bulge, star metallicity decreases. In fact, halo stars are almost entirely Population II stars. Why is this? 

You're closer to the truth. When we talk about the expansion of the Universe, we're really saying that space is being created between all matter. As you mentioned, the Universe may be infinite. It is not like a ball, but rather like a flat grid, and its "expansion" just means that the distances between objects on the grid are getting larger. In essence, more space is being created between the objects. That's what we mean by expansion â€” that objects are moving away from each other, since more space is being created between them. Below is a gif I've made to demonstrate this: 

White dwarfs usually do not collapse, as they have electron degeneracy pressure due to the Pauli exclusion principle. However, if one accretes mass beyond the Chandrasekhar limit, it is energetically favorable for the electrons to combine with protons and form neutrons. This gives us a neutron star. However, neutron stars usually do not collapse into black holes due to neutron degeneracy pressure. How is it possible that beyond the LOV limit, the Pauli exclusion principle no longer prevents the collapse? Shouldn't it still prevent neutrons, which are fermions, from being compressed together any further? I've seen answers involving quark stars, but those are purely hypothetical. What is the most accepted explanation for this? 

The angular momentum comes from the chaotic/turbulent collapse of the parent molecular cloud. The collapse is turbulent because the initial conditions in the parent cloud are not spherically symmetric. This leave the proto-stellar clumps with non-zero angular momentum even if the parent cloud started with zero angular momentum. The sum of the angular momenta of all the material of the original cloud after fragmentation is still that of the cloud before fragmentation. Some other/external triggering events for molecular cloud collapse can impart non-zero angular momentum to the cloud as a whole, but this is not necessary for the the individual fragments to end up with angular momentum. 

The deflection you are looking for is $\sim 1.7$ arc seconds, which should be within the seeing limits at a good site. It should also be within the resolution limits of a telescope with $\ge200$mm diameter primary. Having said that you will not be able to see it with the naked eye, you will need to be able to photography the star field during the eclipse and again when it is visible at night and then do some arduous plate measuring and data reduction to detect the shifts of stars in the field. So amateur equipment is up to detecting the bending of light around the Sun in a total eclipse, but if by witness you mean see the stars move with the naked eye the answer is almost certainly no. 

Why is that? There are some objects in the gap, but why are most of the Oort cloud objects in one area? Shouldn't it also fill the large gap in the picture just as much? 

No. Lunar eclipses are caused when the Moon is in opposition to the Sun. Normally this produces a full moon, but if the Moon is in exact opposition (considering incline of the Moon's orbital plane), all direct sunlight will be blocked from the Moon: 

For example, the Sun is a giant sphere of positively charged plasma. About 72% of the elements in it are protium. This means that these protium atoms would have had to lose their electrons, right? If so, the majority of the Sun would be protons. So just as there are neutron stars, would stars like our Sun be considered "proton stars"? This may be a stupid question, but what I'm really getting at is: are stars mostly protons? Is what I described how it all works? 

Great question! Sorry for this huge response, and it might not be a satisfying answer, but it'll address your questions. Sadly, as with most of astronomy, the Big Bang is surrounded in mystery. It is one of the biggest uncertainties out there, and you'll come to this realization if you've researched it enough. Most of what we can get out of the Big Bang is through extrapolation. If we observe the expansion of the Universe, we can presume that at one point, there was far less space between all the matter in the Universe. This is where things begin to break down, though. Through General Relativity â€” which explains our modern understanding of gravity â€” and our extrapolation, we would reach the phenomena you're describing; the entire Universe would have originated as an infinitely small point (called a singularity), from which matter was incredibly hot. However, General Relativity begins to break down at those levels, since its equations cannot explain the conditions of such a universe accurately. For one, as you hint at, an infinite density and potentially infinite mass would likely have an infinitely strong gravity. There is no place for such infinities in a proper mathematical description of the universe, and at that point, Einstein's equations â€” the basis for predicting the evolution of the cosmos â€” collapse. These equations provide us with unreliable results and we run into some of the problems you are describing. Quantum mechanics is more fit for such small scales, but it fails to explain how gravity acts and what its role was at the time. Thus, this tells us that QM and GR are necessarily incomplete. Their equations cannot describe the Big Bang singularity in its entirety, especially since GR (which deals with large, high-mass phenomena) and QM (which deals with small, low-mass phenomena) are incompatible and cannot describe small, high-mass phenomena. Thus, we're left with a lot of unanswered questions: did the Big Bang create the Universe, or was it simply an event in the Universe's history? Why would the Universe be compressed to such a small scale? Would the idea of an infinitely dense universe go against the presumption of an infinite universe? There has long been hope that these questions can be explained within a theory of quantum gravity. Quantum gravity attempts to unify general relativity and the concepts of quantum theory (QM and QFT). These hopes have recently taken on a more concrete shape, with the help of what is called loop quantum gravity, and its applications to cosmology. Quantum gravity is still unproven and hypothetical. String theory also tries to unify GM and QFT, but is unfalsifiable. Thus, the Big Bang is a point in time that astronomers really know little about. It's unfortunate and surprising, but it's something physicist are trying to overcome. 

The speed of the blast front depends on the initial energy release and the density of the medium into which it is expanding, see here. Theory suggests and measurements confirm expansion rates of the order of thousands of km/s or a few $\times 10^6\ \mbox{m/s}$ or $\sim 1\% \mbox{c}$. 

In the absence of the lighting levels in cities, there are a number of objects in the night sky that are easily seen to move against the background of stars: the Sun, the Moon, Venus, Jupiter, Saturn, Mars and Mercury. These are obvious to anyone who looks at the sky regularly from any dark sky site on clear nights, like most places in the pre-industrial world. These objects are the Planets or Wanderers. The term Solar System is anachronistic when used of ancient astronomy. You have the Fixed Stars which maintain their relative positions but appear to rotate as if fixed to a sphere centred on the observer about a celestial axis about once per day. then you have the Planets which move relative to the Fixed Stars. Together with the Earth itself these constitute the World, Universe or what-have-you. 

In typical seeing condition you should be able to use a magnification (see here) of about 25-30x per inch of apperture, so for your telescope that is about 100x, in exceptional condition you could push that up to maybe double that. Also the more magnification you use the less contrast you will have in the image, so really you want the lowest magnification that gives an image size compatible with being able to see the bands since you will be contrast limited. You will find simulated images of Jupiter through a small telescope here and Saturn here. Though personal experience suggests that the simulated image of Jupiter through a 3" aperture is optimistic. IIRC a suggestion of banding is just about at the limit of what I can see on Jupiter in the small scope. I am guessing that your telescope is this 

This describes how the observable universe will evolve. The Hubble sphere defines the area in which objects are receding from us at or below the speed of light. Beyond this, objects are far enough to recede from us faster than light. The light cone is the region of the Universe capable of influencing us today. Essentially, it is the observable universe, and its boundary is clearly marked. It is, as you mentioned, growing at the speed of light. The light cone does not contain the entire Hubble sphere, since photons from many objects receding faster than light cannot reach us yet. Conversely, the Hubble sphere doesn't contain the entire light cone. This is because photons emitted by objects outside of the Hubble sphere can crawl into regions of space that are receding from us a bit slower than the one from which they were emitted. They can then crawl into regions that expand slower than the last one, and so on. Eventually, the photons will reach regions of space that aren't expanding faster than light, and they can reach us. Now, there is a distance beyond which space expands faster than the light can traverse it. This distance is called the cosmic event horizon. Light from beyond the event horizon will never reach us. Our observable universe grows because more photons come into our view. However, the observable universe will infinitely approach the event horizon, since light from beyond there can never reach us. Thus, after an incomprehensibly long time, the observable universe would stop growing. At this point, it may finally be possible to travel through space beyond the observable universe.
