Actually, by using writing I believe you've picked the worst, or most confusing example for exploring improbability and skepticism. I largely agree with Ben Piper. Writing itself is highly and very intentionally improbable. We create symbols that are not readily confused with the products of natural events. By this means we create communicable "meaning," which lies in the reduction of possibility to actuality, uncertainty to certainty. We will seek meaning even in scrambled "writing." So your ketchup (spilled at Belshazzar's banquet, no doubt) actually signals a very high, almost certainly non-coincidental probability of mediating some other intelligence like ours. Precisely by appearing as "writing" and "meaningful writing" it has done what we intend to do in information: reduce all other possibilities to near zero. The "epistemic" principle, if you want to call it that, is here to be found in the intentional structure of language, representation, and the more difficult problem of "meaning." Given that languages are arguably the deepest structures of rational being and are designed precisely to minimize natural "noise," we would almost have to be technically irrational to accept your scenario as "coincidence." 

As others have noted, the question you are asking is most famously addressed in philosophy by Kant's Critique of Judgment. Unfortunately, Kant's system is somewhat idiolectic and not amenable to brief, clear summaries. Phillip Klocking's answer, while accurate, has not only indicated as much, but--if I may be excused for saying so--demonstrated it as well. Aesthetics refers in the Greek to sensation and feeling, and was often contrasted unfavorably with "reasoning" or logic. Its status shifted when the British Empiricists argued that all true knowledge was derived from the senses and only manipulated by logic, as if by a calculator. This left the validity of reasoned judgments and moral judgments open to skepticism. Weren't they just based in the senses, and thus purely contingent? Kant was especially concerned about the "relativity" of morals. He attempts to show that our "judgments" are not randomly based in passing sensations. Our sensations and experiences are only comprehensible because they already have a rational structure a priori. This structure is not arbitrary, because it is necessary for all "rational beings" and "rational judgments." This inner structure of concepts organizes all of our sensations and judgments in an essentially "universal" way...at least as far as human beings go. As you can guess, this places "aesthetics" in a different light. Prior to Kant, artistic judgments were considered a matter of "taste" and possibly "breeding." It was no more important to philosophy or reason than which food one prefers. No one would logically argue about which food is "better" or "truer." It's just a contingent matter of taste based on passing sensations and personal experience. But Kant noted that we do indeed tend to argue that a painting, novel, or symphony is "superior" to pulp. That a beautiful old forest is "better" than a functional parking lot. (Kant was, in fact, more concerned with beauty in nature than art, and it is easier to see his arguments in this way. Not unlike E. O. Wilson's "biophilia.") When we make such aesthetic judgments, we do expect others to agree, as if to an argument. They seem deeper and closer to our innate "reasoning" than simple matters of taste. Kant developed the idea of aesthetic judgment as a sort of pure "conceptualizing," in the loose sense, without content, a feeling of "purposefulness" minus any specified "purpose." It was not simply the casual impact of the senses determining a subjective judgment. It was an act of "inner causation," the pure exercise of our very powers of judgment. Needless to say, all the gory Kantian details are missing in my crude synopsis. But I hope this gives you some direction. Kant was the first to reintroduce aesthetics into modern philosophy, and his Critique of Judgment is where your answer begins. In more recent philosophy, "linguistic structure" or "sociobiology" or "cognitive sciences" may pursue something similar, if less coherent, in their attempts to relate sensations to universal attributes of "mind," or rational judgment. 

Austria (Vienna) to me is the classic case study here. One of the characters of great interest, Karl Lueger. This man knew how to get elected. He knew how to appeal to the petit bourgeoisie. There is very little new under the sun. It's just amazing how this one city in the late 19th Century, early 20th century continues to have its influence on the world. The number of imporant figures who passed through Vienna before , and in the early years after, WWI is astounding. Lenin was there. Hitler. They all got an education of sorts in Vienna. But this is just the tip of the iceberg of the figures who passed through. Even today I watch Austria for trends, because it is small, and it can change quickly. What I think we have here is a limitation of consciousness. A circle is drawn, permissible news is inside the circle, and many times a busy public has no idea what is outside the circle, unless they put in an effort. When we speak of the press and propaganda, usually I think of a central authority which can control the content. Of key importance is what is left out. On the other hand, the major players in the commercial press are also centralized today. The fake news talk came from Trump I think. I am sure someone will correct me if I'm wrong. Trump got his education from a man named Roy Cohn, and to know the great and highly unusual character and lawyer Cohn is to know Trump. Cohn was capable of creating a storm of contradictions, one simply could not penetrate it. And it worked, until it didn't work, but for a long time it worked for Cohn. Is the American press good? Is it doing it's job for the American public? No, of course not. But it is not as bad as Trump says it is. The normal operation of the American press is to titillate the public but not to really rock the boat. We don't want people to stop shopping. So fake news seems to be a charge, like an indictment of the press, but it sticks at least a little bit because there is some truth to it. Who is the philosopher here? Probably Baudrillard. The news is written, for the most part, before it happens. The story is ready before the event even happens. We also have Marcuse, the totally administered society and individual. After saying all this, however, it must be pointed out that many people who care to find the truth (or something close to it) can find it. They may not want to find it. It may not all come out at one time, but they can find it. And finally, regarding America, we are a big country. It is just hard to fool everybody all the time. 

If you are just starting philosophy, good for you. However, you have picked a pretty tall mountain for your first climb. I must confess that I have never read Being and Nothingness, but I can say a little about the term being, which does take some getting used to. Sartre was influenced by (or, some would say misinterpreted) Heidegger, who is often credited with returning modern philosophy to the "question of being." Heidegger claims that the Greeks were the first to have a distinct term for "being" and were thus enabled to think about the distinction between some "thing" and the "existence of" that thing. In some sense we might say that "being" or "existing" is that which all things have in common, even dreams, fairies, words, trees, people, and theories. They may have very different modes of existing, but we might say all... exist. But what does this mean? The first thing is to notice that, as with much philosophy, it brings into view something we take for granted, something that becomes invisible to us. Part of Heidegger's argument was that the Greek origins of philosophy lie in this very "not taking for granted" this state of just... existing. Or, as he put it "being there" or Dasein. One way to get a feel for it is just to look at the words for being. Something exits, is, will be, was, might be, cannot be. Is it the same as saying something is real, actual? When we say an apple is fruit and an apple is red...are we saying it is "identical to" fruit or "equal to" fruit? Just think about the words and let their oddity sink in. When Heidegger "returned" to being, what he meant was that he reopened "ontology," the study of "what things actually exist." That is one of the main branches of classical philosophy, along with logic, ethics, and "epistemology," or how we come to "attain and verify knowledge." Since Kant, philosophy had moved away from "useless arguments" about ontology to focus on epistemology or "how we know" what we know. Heidegger and his lineage, including Sartre, turned back to the close observation of being, or in what manner things around us exist. What organizes those things? Are we just an empty center of "beings" or "existences" encompassing our own... being? This is not an explanation, obviously, but I hope it gives you a feel for the approach. I would encourage you to look at some guide books, philosophical dictionaries, and other references on "ontology" and "existentialism." Sartre's "formal" work is dense and difficult. A massive French misinterpretation of Heidegger written on amphetamines, some might say. It builds on a very complex set of issues and terminologies that pass from Descartes through Kant, Husserl, and Heidegger. So it is hardly surprising one doesn't just "get it." One final tip. Always look at the etymology. Take the words "being" or "is" or the French or Greek, or any other apparently common words you encounter in philosophy, and just look back at the history of the word's parts and meanings. We take words for granted, and in philosophy you have to "freeze" them, put them in a specimen jar, and examine them carefully, noting how odd they really are. 

What you say reminds me of Fichte. Not exactly Fichte, but in the "neighborhood" of Fichte. $URL$ Note as you read the article when you come to "second order images...." Fichte: Gentlemen, think the wall, now, gentlemen, think the one who thinks the wall.... This seems to run to an infinite regress. However, and now we move past Fichte I think, there is this intuitive feeling that this "you" is always available to us, this extra "you", if you will. Frederick Copleston, a well known Anglo historian of philosophy, took note of this extra "you" (like an always available extra) and he had something interesting to say about it but I can't remember exactly what it was! If I can find it I will update this post. I don't know if any of this will help you, but my intuition ! tells me you might benefit from the Andy Bluden article above. I think somehow something in Fichte might further stimulate your thinking. 

In psychological therapy, the psychologist can do one of two things with a patient's defense mechanism, he can help the patient build it up, or he can work with the patient to make it unnecessary. The latter is much harder work. The psychologist is looking at this from a societal, psychosocial viewpoint. What will allow a cohesiveness so we don't have these terrible anti-social acts, like mass murder? Well, as a defense, have a big story, a religion. Keep in mind, not all religions even have the concept of an afterlife. But still there is a type of cohesion among the members. So the psychologist is asking: what will keep the social frabric from tearing apart? This is my guess. As far as you yourself, you normally don't have any anxiety over this issue, until you listen to a show like this. In other words, you don't need a defense mechanism right now in your life to prevent anxiety about meaning. (I am speaking purely from a psychological perspective). You may never need one. Who knows what your future will bring? Some people have "conversion experiences" etc., like a miracle. Who am I to question them? It is unlikely you will ever have a simple faith, but you may have a complicated faith one day, or you may not. Again, who knows? Of course you know yourself better than I do, but none of us know the future. I am not saying that the psychologist is not genuine in his religious beliefs, what I am saying is that he is a product of his life experience, professional experience, and his eduction: psychology, social psychology and so on. This all goes to make up the person he is today, and he recommends religion or a big belief of some kind. What of the larger questions here? Here is a little YouTube of Derrida: $URL$ I don't know much about Derrida, and frankly I don't know all that he's driving at, but I've always thought this was interesting. We have this thing called "spooky action at a distance"? What is it? I don't know. Does science really know? My point is, do we know everything yet? I don't think so. We are certainly trained to look for a natural explanation, the odds favor that course, but do we know everything even as regards method? Of course, the fact that we don't know everything does not mean there is a god or gods etc, but it should give us some humility I think. 

This is a question of bibliography and printing, but also of the "physical" history of philosophy. (Hence my "Marxist" tag). And probably has a simple definitive answer. My cheap Penguin version of CPR "based on" Muller presents the antinomies in a side-by-side, two-column format. A textual plan increasingly rare in "modern" nonmathematical publishing, used at various times in various ways. Unfortunately, I cannot afford to buy lots of Kant editions. Did Kant himself insist on this presentation? Is this presentation of the antinomies the same in both original editions of CPR? In first translations? And ($64,000 question) in Kant's own drafts and manuscripts? 

No "laws of the universe" are universal. They work to a certain scale of statistical observation. With more observation or new instrumentation they invariably fail. New laws reconstitute symmetry, then fail in turn. The most fundamental law of physics is the second "law" of thermodynamics. It can only be argued statistically from a given scale of observation. Yet is the "most fundamental" law. Conclusion: Laws of physics reconstitute symmetry. They are our way of exporting entropy. What we call "the universe" is better conceived of as our entropy exporting "membrane." 

I am confused by your fourth paragraph, so perhaps this is more of a question than an answer. I don't see that you can mix the physics and the speculative metaphysics in this way and also retain an "experimental method." There seems to be a third "viewpoint" comparing scenarios and reasoning about the parallel "evidence" and diverging logic of the conclusions. If your memory, the evidence of your senses, and your reasoned conclusions all diverge uniquely and radically from those of the other experimental observers, then your being "convinced MWI is true" makes you either a very bad experimental scientist or, more to the point, a highly unreliable observer, perhaps technically insane. This sounds like an inappropriate, facetious answer. Perhaps. But I cannot see that the scenario you describe, with one continuous, conscious observer comparing multiple MWI outcomes with an ever-diverging universe of fellow experimentalists, is one in which the experimental method pertains or can be used to arrive at any conclusions whatsoever. Though I am not familiar with the literature, it would seem to me that the "physics" of your MWI experiment contains a number of unexamined assumptions about identity and continuity of consciousness. More "observer" paradoxes than physics can survive. Perhaps these are, in fact, worked out in discussions of MWI, and if so I'd be curious to have some references. It's very interesting. 

I think Joseph Weissman has already given one possible answer, Nietzsche. If the only Christian died on the cross, where does that leave Christianity? As myth. And not just as a Christian myth, but as already parasitical of Greek myth. Jesus is clearly acting out the part of Dionysus. The plot-scheme of the four Gospels is soaked in wine, and Jesus himself is connected with wine over and over again. Jesus acts out other parts as well (see Isaiah). Nietzsche says God is dead, but for Nietzsche there was never a real God, the myth of God was dead. But maybe Nietzsche was too pessimistic and he didn't take into account mankind's love of a good story, but that can't be right, because he proceeded to write his own stories, his own myth! We are dealing with myths inside of myths as the new religions dig into the past for material. Look at some of the New Age stuff. But the real possibilities of these myths (some may say stories) are in filmmaking now. Surely there will be a New Age Batman , but only after there is a Christian superhero film first. Maybe there has already been one. "Jesus Christ Superstar", (1973)? Broadly speaking, it appears that in our history we have gone from having religions, to having myths, to having mere stories. But the relationship between religion and myth seems very complicated to me. I have read that the region of Mesopotamia was where many religions got their start. As far as religion and myth go, they seem to exist in a circular relationship with each other. First the religion comes, then it dies or fades out, and the religion then fades into myth. The myth then becomes a source of themes and material for the making of the next religion. It's also possible for one religion to spawn another one, and Judaism has been a rich source of material in this regard. It seems that mankind needs some sort of larger-than-life narrative to keep himself going. Over the long stretch of history, we have become thoroughly desacralized and demythologized as we have begun to "see through" the religion-myth circular interaction. We have become jaded, but we still crave the narrative. Nietzsche himself has become a source of "new"myth,Overman, Zarathustra, which is no great surprise as he had been a professor of classics, or philology, at Bern. And who is Zarathustra but Zoroaster!? Is there anything new under the sun? Nietzsche, who supposedly wiped away metaphysics, and religion-myth created his own text or myth as a lense through which to see our world. This is the text as Derrida described it: our approach to the world is through a grand text. A massive piece of art. But isn't this text, that tells us how "to be" just a new metaphysics? Because the largest part of a metaphysics is its ontological scheme. 

I must agree with Cort Ammon, this idea of "discovering the fallacy" is a bit like trying to run everything through a computer and find the error. I would offer as a basic moral law: Recognize what you depend on. Like most moral laws, it is both prudential and a regulative ideal, not something one can flawlessly carry out. Obviously, you depend on your food. Obviously, then, you should understand, as best you circumstantially can, where it comes from. And in fact, most us know nothing about it. So you do have a certain moral duty to discover the source of what you depend on. And here, your "moral duty" is also quite prudential, sensible, practical. But in a world dependent upon complex divisions of labor, this "moral duty" can never be fully and perfectly realized. You must realize that you do indeed "depend upon" something...in this case, food. Then you must ask, where does it come from? This is a functionalist description of "conscience." We always have a certain duty to ask. But a finite capacity to ask about everything. 

This is a very amusing question, and I like the considerations you articulate. To place it in a less solitary context, you are asking about moral standards that are not "utilitarian" or "consequentialist." In other words, approaches to morality that are not based on harm to others or the consequences of actions.These are sometimes called "deontic." So your habit of sneaking around behind your own back is wrong only through a "deontic" approach to morality... of which Kant is the best-known "modern" representative. The "wrong" lies in the rational contradiction between the "universalization" of the act and the very assumptions that make the act possible...in this case the rules of solitaire. Kant's example of lying is similar. If we "universalize" that act, the act of lying itself would not be possible or rational, since it depends in itself on the reliability of language. Ditto for solitaire. In fact, your example plays into the transition from Kant to Wittgenstein, for whom our practices are enabled by their rules or "language games." Your sense that you wouldn't want your "mother" to know is a good Kantian example of the way "universalizing" such idealism is also grounded in our human social being and "common sense." I believe your question has a funny stance that also invites more nuanced answers. But I'll leave it at this. I tend to admire Kant. But personally, I cheat at computer chess, by taking back moves. (On the other hand, my chess application cheats too. It often crashes just when I have a nice position set up.) 

Yes I think so. "Strictly speaking, what admit of truth and falsity are NOT statements as repeatable patterns of utterance, but individual events of statement utterance". Emphasis mine. "The crucial point of contact between description and reality is to be sought in the utterance of a statement on the occasion of a stimulation to which that string of words has become associated." Both from Pg. 1, Quine, Methods of Logic, 4th ed. (Harvard Press, 1982). This answers your question I think, though it may not seem to do so. How would you measure changing truth value over time with anything less than a series of individual events of statement utterances based upon individual occasions of stimulation? (Very loosely speaking, at logic-level we are digitized,0101001 e.g. etc, not analog). 

I have erased some of my over-the-top comments and I am writing a short answer really to put Barinder's question back on top again because it was a good question. My feeling is that Nietzsche is writing an anti-philosophy, and that he would suggest that we humans operate on the level of the instincts. The only check on this would be the true ascetic aristocratic mode of being. The true aristocrat was after land and he was a warrior, not a thinker. Rarely will you find an aristocrat and a thinker in one person, though Descartes had the misfortune of running across one with a very cold library. Aristocrats fight for what they want, and they satisfy their instinctual urges without any qualms, but this requires a warrior spirit and this requires a fit body, and this may require a somewhat asetic life. We philosophers (who know our Nietzsche) are called to give up our thinking, and our word play to to become this kind of "philosopher-aristocrat", if you will. This is very much Nietzsche's version of the philosopher king, not Plato's. The second point would be on Descartes' "I", and whether perhaps Nietzsche had studied some Buddhism (idea from Schopenhauer?), and that Nietzsche began to question the idea of the "I" in Descartes (i.e. Buddha would say no "I", no ego, it is not to be found). At any rate, if Buddhism worked to calm Schopenhauer's Will, it would actually defeat Nietzsche's larger project of turning man into an instinctual doer, with the only possible check against the gross display of instinct being the temperament of the true aristocrat (the ascetic, warrior temperament, not a life of luxury and gluttony). Of course, Nietzsche could not actually "insist" on anything it seems to me, at bottom, his philosophy or anti-philosophy says all facts are interpretations, and this is itself an interpretation...so this is doing, instincts and not thinking, with all the problems and benefits that come along with doing and not thinking. 

There seem to be a lot of questions that pop up here about failed applications of the Categorial Imperative, somehow "disproving" its validity. This seems misguided. Since I am not a Kant expert, I hope others will point out any misunderstandings on my part. This attention to applications is, I believe, somewhat misplaced and stems from the difficulty we have today in grasping philosophical idealism in general and the modern transcendental variants. We are simply too steeped in physics, utilitarianism, and psychology. Kant's CI might best be understood as something like Newton's laws of motion, though of course as the "laws" of reflective, mental motion they can hardly be applied with mathematical precision. The CI is an a priori principle that is necessary to beings endowed with reason, freedom, and moral sensibilities. One can reject that description entirely in favor of selfish genes, or whatever, and in that sense not only the CI but all of Kant's project can be deemed a "failure" of precise physical description. But if we tend to accept that, yes, we have a capacity for reason, autonomy, and moral duty--as well as a capacity for scientific knowledge of the world--then Kant is demonstrating the a priori structure necessary for the coherent integration of such capacities. One essential part of this structure is the highly general principle of the CI. Just as Newton observed "motions" and derived a universal principle within a coordinate system, so Kant observed "emotions" and moral behaviors in the phenomenal world and derived the abstract, noumenal principle to which they all refer and relative to which we may understand them. Even Newton's laws of motion, while "universal" and "necessary" in some sense are idealized. They do not apply at certain scales, as we now know...and, crucially, they do not even apply exactly with absolute accuracy in any given, particular instance.They are "regulative ideals" to use one of Kant's terms. They posit an ideal motionless space full of infinite ideal points, relative to which we can plot the motions of macro-objects to a high but technically limited degree of accuracy. Similarly, the CI is the logical structure derived, we might say, from reflection upon all moral actions in the world, also within the posited space-time limits of "sensibility." Or such is Kant's argument, a compelling one, I believe. We can never know by simple observation whether any particular action is moral by Kant's definition, because we can never observe precisely the intentions motivating it, even in ourselves. Nor can the CI simply be applied in any particular case. If it could be, we might as well replace juries and judges with computers. We refer to it only as an a priori principle and regulative ideal that helps us explain what we mean by immorality and moral duty as practices in the highly conditional, imperfectly grasped world. It is the logic discernible behind many valid moral and religious practices, and our good "common sense," yet it was important to Kant that it not be based simply on a reference to God or any other authority. In keeping with the spirit of Aufklarung, it is derived critically from the necessary coherent interactions of freedom and reason. Kant himself states somewhere that he does not expect the CI to apply exactly to actual cases, though I do not recall the reference. In the four examples he gives, he is assuming we accept the ordinary understanding that they are right or wrong, then he asks us to discern what general principle or form they might share in common. How can we express concisely and consistently what makes these various actions appear to us as "moral imperatives"? What logical common denominator describes how the rational being judged some practice to be "right"? That is the CI. While applications might always be improved, that is an adjustment of judgements within the contingencies of the world, not an "improvement" of the CI itself. And, as with Newton's laws, we may find ourselves adding subsidiary principles as new social situations and even new forms of "common sense" arise, though probably without Kant's blessings. For example, Rawls' "difference principle" seems to me a valuable addition within the contingencies of capitalist democracies, so far from the sleepy civilities of the Prussian order.
