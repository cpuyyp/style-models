Let $O$ be an open subset of the separable Hilbert space H and $k\geq0$ . Consider $C_b^k(O, Sym(H))$, the space of k-times continuously differentiable maps with values in the bounded symmetric endomorphisms of $H$, bounded up to their k-th derivative. Equipped with the usual norm this space becomes a Banach space. Is this space separable, i.e. has a dense sequence? I need this result for transversality theory in Morse theory, where the space above serves as a space of suitable perturbations. The separability is needed in order to aplly the Sard-Smale theorem. 

This one is analogous to an Ramras' answer: Donaldson's theorem from the 80s and the corresponding Seiberg-Witten stuff. 

I am looking for a list of the irreducible representations of O(2). Could someone please provide a reference? EDIT: I am particularly interested in the representations on IR^2 (irreducible or not) 

Let $I$ be a bounded interval and consider a sequence $(u_k)$ in $H^{1,2}(I)$ (usual Sobolev space). Suppose furthermore, that the sequence $(u_k)$ is bounded in $H^{1,2}(I)$. Then, by Rellich, we can extract a subsequence, still denoted by $u_k,$ s.t. $u_k$ converges to some $\bar{u}$ in $C^0(I)$. Furthermore, by weak compactness of bounded sets in $H^{1,2}(I)$ we can select a subsequence, s.t. $u_k$ converges to some $u$ weakly in $H^{1,2}(I)$. Thus, $u_k$ converges to $\bar{u}$ in $C^0$ and weakly to $u$ in $H^{1,2}$. Do these limits coincide, i.e. is it true that $u=\bar{u}$? 

This precise question grew out from the question whether a smooth commutative $k$-algebra (char($k$)=$0$) is always cofibrant as a non-positively graded commutative differential graded co-chain $k$-algebra. I think the answer is no (while the converse is true). For this I'd need at least one example of the following situation: a smooth commutative $k$-algebra $R$, a commutative $k$-algebra $S$, together with a NON square-zero ideal $I\subseteq S$, and a $k$-algebra morphism $R\rightarrow S/I$ that does NOT admit a lift to a $k$-algebra morphism $R\rightarrow S$. (Of course, any such example should have $R$ not a polynomial $k$-algebra.) I know it gotta be easy but I was not able to find out one. Thanks for any answer, Sereza. 

René Thom proved that for any topological space $X$, any integral homology class of $X$ (of any degree) has an odd multiple that is the pushforward of the fundamental class of a smooth compact oriented manifold mapping contin to $X$. So, if we pass to $rational$ homology, then any rational homology class of $X$ is the pushforward of an at most rational multiple of the fundamental class of a smooth compact oriented manifold mapping to $X$. Have there appeared other, different proofs (i.e. different from Thom's) of this last rational result since? 

Thanks to Bill Johnson! My question is easily answered by a direct application of the closed graph theorem (one shows that the diagonal is closed in the mixed norms). Unfortunately, I did not have this one as an exercise in my functional analysis class! 

You have to extend J to be defined on your embedding space. Thus, your equation a priori depends on your chosen embedding. Of course the point here is to prove certain properties of your solutions that make it a posteriori independent of the embedding. For instance, Riviere often works with such embeddings and then shows regularity properties (such as harmonic maps from surfaces which are a priori only $W^{1,2},$ but then are shown to be Hölder). In my opinion the main point here is the bigger bag principle. Classically for instance to solve the Dirichlet problem you use minimization of the Dirichlet functional. To capture the limit however requires you to use a complete space. Then to recover a usable solution you have to use regularity results. Notice however that you cannot use these regularity results if you do not have your bigger bag already. It is similar in the holomorphic curve setting, where sometimes it is useful to consider suitable embeddings of the target manifold and work with Sobolev spaces with low regularity (such spaces are not intrinsically defined if the Sobolev space in question does not embed into the space of continuous functions). Usually in holomorphic curve theory one considers moduli spaces involving a fixed target space. Then it is feasible to work with target-depending moduli spaces as long as you can prove your wanted statement. Sometimes this is not possible since at some point you need more regularity (for instance in gluing). 

Let $A$ be a commutative $\mathbb{C}$-algebra, and consider $C_{\bullet}(A,A)$ the simplicial Hochschild homology module of $A$ with respect to itself (i.e. $C_{n}(A,A)=A^{\otimes (n+1)}$). This is a simplicial commutative $\mathbb{C}$-algebra and we can take its $Spec$ levelwise, to get a cosimplicial $\mathbb{C}$-scheme $X_A :=Spec(C_{\bullet}(A,A))$. If $A$ is of finite type over $\mathbb{C}$, then we may take levelwise the associated topological space for the analytic topology, and get a cosimplicial topological space, denoted $X_{A}^{top}$. My question is whether somebody knows what the geometric realization of $X_{A}^{top}$ looks like (e.g. any relation to the topological free loop space of $(Spec(A))^{top}$?). 

I am a bit confused by the relevant literature I am aware of on the subject (Quillen, Avramov, etc.), so I would like to ask the following question to more expert people than me. [The question has been edited below using Damian and Unknown's comments, and actually split into two different ones.] Let $X$ and $Y$ be schemes over a field $k$, and let $f: X\rightarrow Y$ be a morphism locally of finite presentation. Consider the relative cotangent complex $L_{X/Y}$ of $f$ as a cochain complex in non-positive degrees. $Question$ $1.$ Suppose we know furthermore that (a) $\mathbb{L}_{X/Y}$ is perfect, (b) $\mathbb{L}_{X/Y}$ is of perfect amplitude in $[-n,0]$, for $n>>0$. Does it follows that $\mathbb{L}_{X/Y}$ is of perfect amplitude in $[-2,0]$ ? $Question$ $2.$ Suppose we know furthermore (i.e. in addition to (a) and (b)) that (c) $f$ is of finite Tor-dimension, Does it follows that $\mathbb{L}_{X/Y}$ is of perfect amplitude in $[-1,0]$ ? Note that I am not assuming any Noetherian property for $X$ and $Y$.
