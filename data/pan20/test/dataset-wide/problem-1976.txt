Different people have different communication styles, which includes different levels of comfort speaking with people they don't know. You may find it helpful to learn about the DiSC model of behavior. Searching "DiSC Model" will turn up a lot of links, some better than others. $URL$ is a good place to start, in my opinion. Briefly, humans can be divided into those that are people focused and those that are task focused. They can also be divided into those that are high energy and those that are low energy. Those divisions define a 4 quadrant system that turns out to be very effective in identifying the way people prefer to behave when they haven't thought about their behavior ahead of time. DiSC is not written in stone, it only identifies preferences. People can change their behavior, if they have a reason to change and think about it first. In the case of a morning greeting, someone who is high energy and people focused is very likely to greet everyone they see, and expect other people to be just like them and greet them back. Someone who is low energy and task focused is the opposite. The "why" of your question is often a difference in DiSC styles. You can't change their style, but you can moderate yours. A "High I" (high energy, people focused) greeting a "High C" (low energy, task focused) will get best results with a simple and low toned "Morning", with a neutral facial expression. A "High S" (low energy, people focus) greeting a "High D" (high energy, task focus) will get better results with an energetic "Good Morning" and a smile, and not asking how they are today. A "High I" greeting another "High I" can go to town with fist bumps and "Good Morning! Awesome day! Did you see that sunrise - really cool!" 

I see this in small startup companies. In my experience there was the CEO and their inner circle, and they would brainstorm marketing ideas and get riled up, then have staff drop everything and hastily execute their ideas, whether they were awful or not. Best thing to do was sit back and let them do their schemes, because 95% of the time they crashed and burned because the "inner circle" had zero technically savvy people. IMO, your opinion is best on request, but there's a good chance your suggestions don't go through (just from my experience w/ a CEO who acted similarly). 

If their temperament permits it, people will get offended even if you speak to them in the most professional, unbiased tone. Just get the point across: If he asks you to do something unreasonable, say "I'm busy, you will have to return it." A reasonable person might even connect the dots eventually: "Oh no! Have I been offending him this entire time by making these requests?" In this case you'd have nothing to explain; you are coworkers, not superior/subordinate. He will task you as many times as you permit him. But I think the way to avoid offending him if it's within your best interest that way is to be frank, direct, and don't allow it to boil over into frustration for yourself. This is for everything but the rest area. If you open something, or turn something on, it's your responsibility to shut it down and so forth. That's just common courtesy, and it should go unsaid. If he doesn't do it, people such as supervisors will catch on. 

It is important that the different people working on a project understand what their roles are. As the technical lead, he seems to believe that he is supposed to be involved in technical decisions. When you comment on the technical aspects, he may be taking this as (a) taking over his job and (b) making commitments about the product that you really can't. Taking over his job It sounds like the tech lead feels like you're trying to take over his job. You, as program manager, are making technical comments, which he may see as decisions/commitments. Let's look at it from his perspective. You have a technical background, but is it with this product? Are you familiar with the codebase? Are you familiar with the code changes that are already planned by the tech lead - not the features that will be added, but the implementation details? As technical lead, what exactly is his role? What is he responsible for? Making the decisions? Designing the product? Providing time estimates? Guiding technical implementation? Whatever is his responsibility, this needs to be made clear - to the both of you. Let's reverse the roles. If he were to start commenting about program management aspects would you be offended? If he started making comments about the schedule as it reflects other teams' work to other teams, to your boss, or to the vice president, how would that look? If he started talking to production and asking them about when they can start engaging in this project, would that be OK? What if he were to tell customers that the project would be ready for their acceptance testing on a particular date - one that you had never expressed? What if you had other things you were trying to schedule and knew that the date would never work? Or if you had a private discussion with your manager and s/he was pressuring you for a different date? What if he went to the VP and started talking about how QA's schedule was not in alignment with the rest of the project, but you knew that it was? You need to let him be responsible for doing his job, and you need to be responsible for doing yours. You have plenty of work to do as a project manager without trying to take over the technical implementation. So how do you use your technical knowledge? If you can't design stuff for the dev team, and you can't comment on implementations, how can you use your technical knowledge? You can consider what the dev team is committing to and ask intelligent questions from the angle of project management. Don't tell them what database to use or what the implications will be, but ask them for a breakdown of how long it will take to use their database of choice, and future impacts (incorporating bug fixes and upgrades). If you know that their breakdown is missing something (like integration testing with the database) then ask them to add that to the estimate. Use your knowledge as a BS detector, which will help you determine if work can be re-scheduled to be faster. When the dev team says that it'll take 4 weeks to write a new SQL query, dig deeper. Ask for a time breakdown. Make sure that the time breakdown is reasonable. Where things are out of whack, dig deeper there - with more time breakdowns. Tools to help you fix this There are tools, like RACI (responsible, accountable, consulted, informed) charts that are designed to serve just this purpose. Whatever you do, be constructive! He's rubbed you the wrong way, and I'm sure you've rubbed him the wrong way. The relationship is at a rough spot, but that doesn't mean it's unsalvageable. You can still work to recover the relationship. One of the most important things here is to recognize that you both really have the same goal: make the company make money so you can both get paid. This means that you need to approach conversations collaboratively. You need to demonstrate, possibly multiple times, in a way that he can recognize, that you really are there to help. 

Document the frequency and nature of the interruptions. You can actually create two categories for most interruptions: reasonable and unreasonable. Reasonable interruptions are those that are defined in the scope of your job but also that a given employee cannot on their own accomplish with their skills, time or effort. Unreasonable interruptions would be those that don't fit your criteria: okay so you have to help people, they ask you a question and you answer it. Then, the same person keeps asking you about the same thing over and over. This is an example of unreasonable! Take the unreasonable interruptions and put together some tutorials/FAQ/manuals either in a server folder or a binder, and get everyone into a team meeting. Tell them exactly what kind of interruptions are unreasonable, and in the aforementioned materials they can find most of their answers without having to come find you. Reasonable interruptions, however, no matter how many you get will still need to be tackled based on their priority. You can also implement a sort of ticket system. Tell people they will need to email you with their questions or issues so that you can make structured time to go out and help them. IMO these are good steps you can take without escalating the issue to management and essentially take control of the issue yourself. 

Talk to your manager and coworkers and ask how they solve problems like this. There might be a process you don't know about. When you talk to the folks in the US, assume that there are good reasons for why things are done as they are, and that there's a process for what you need. Ask them how to go about solving this challenge. It might be very simple, like submitting a request and getting your manager's approval. And assuming that they are coming from a good place helps to attain collaboration instead of antagonism. Don't complain. You'll turn off your audience and you'll make things harder on yourself. Be as helpful to the person from whom you need help as you can. If they tell you that something will take them time, ask if there's anything you can do to help so that it will be easier or take less time. The answer is usually 'no', but the offer is usually appreciated. Keep your manager up to date as you work on this. S/he needs to know if you are making progress or if your are running into roadblocks. When emails don't work, use the phone. If you have a phone call with someone in the US, try to have the call at a reasonable time for those in the US. We in the US are often forced to have calls with people overseas at very uncomfortable hours, either before normal work hours (and before we usually wake up) or after normal work hours (sometimes after we normally go to sleep). While they should make a reasonable effort to accommodate your schedule, you should make an effort to accommodate theirs. Smile when you are on the phone. You may not think it makes a difference, but it changes the whole tone of your voice. If you think that there's any chance that a cultural difference may be in the way, apologize and admit that you really aren't an expert in the US culture and you don't want to offend. It's not your fault, but apologizing deescalates and helps things move along. If you can't make any progress, talk to your boss and ask them what to do. When you ask for something, and you are told 'no' ask 'what is the process for getting access?' If they give you a process, follow it. 

Don't "confront" your boss. You can ask for more information from him, but confrontation will just hurt whatever relationship you have. From what you have said here, it sounds to me like @RobM is on track. It isn't you, it's the CEO creating a role for someone else. And perhaps your manager not being very focused on your development. To help you grow your skills, I'm happy to suggest Manager Tools ($URL$ where you will find a large number of free podcasts on management. Start with the Basics feed, and then branch out. They have been a huge help to me. 

I had this problem. Overhead glare, and facility management that refused to have overhead lights be turned off during work hours. The solution that ended up working was to wear a hat with a brim or an eyeshade. That cut the glare from overhead to where it was tolerable. When I later moved cubes in the same office, I discovered it wasn't the brightness that was the problem, it was the exact location of the overhead light in relation to my monitor. If you have some flexibility in where you place your equipment, moving it a bit one direction or another may help. 

I would spin this in the experience/project sections where you're stating what you accomplished: "Reporting to/Working under John Smith, Ph.D., I defined parts of the Curriculum Vitae where it would be appropriate to name drop." If they're influential in the field, you'll (A) know this, and (B) benefit from the association in part. Don't tell us everyone you've ever worked with, though, because name-dropping becomes tiring at a point and not every association will benefit you. 

Start-ups normally require the average employee to don a number of hats because of the nature of the company type. Often understaffed, exploratory/experimental, and lots of promises on the table that need delivery. So the problem is that then, everyone is stretched super thin and you need to be able to hit the ground running. This is just an aspect of start-ups, and if you literally have no idea what they're doing I can guarantee it'll be hard without heavy research and time investment outside of regular working hours. 

If you're receiving academic credit through this CPT, you might find it prudent to get in touch with someone at your university about your issue. Regularly, an employment contract—whether temporary or permanent—will contain all the major stipulations, however, from what I can tell is that you've signed an offer letter. An offer letter differs fundamentally from an employment contract in that the contract is very thorough in what can and can't happen, and includes severance clauses that make it very detrimental to breach. An offer letter is a little bit more tentative. You can often find at-will employment sections in offer letters such as: "Your employment will be at-will, meaning that [the Company] may terminate your employment at any time, with or without cause, and with or without notice..." And so hence the provisions of your offer letter may not constitute an argument herein. I do however suspect that there is something contractual here between your university and the internship employer that you should probably have addressed, again, by someone at the university. To go any further in the matter you will undoubtedly need legal advice, as I'm not a lawyer, but from my standpoint now it would seem that for whatever reasons it's whoever issued the incorrect CPT duration who is at fault and needs to be spoken with. 

The specific process differs by employer. This answer is marked wiki so anyone can expand the answer. Finding a job There are a few ways to find a job. Go do a job search on a jobs website (like dice.com). You can create a professional profile that describes your experience (such as on linkedin), and join groups on such website where they list jobs. You can contact a recruiter. You can go to the website of the company where you want to work and figure out how to apply. You can contact contacts in your professional network and ask if they know of anything. You can contact the school from which you graduated and see if they have a job search/placement program. recruiters If you contact a recruiter, be aware of how they work. Do you pay them or does the hiring company? What happens if you find a job and apply to it, then they tell you about it? Do they require an exclusive deal? Do they focus on a particular region or a particular field? Are they okay if you use a different recruiter for a different region or field? What does the other recruiter/contract say? Will they modify your resume (they should never do this without your express approval). Showing willingness to relocate If the job requires relocation, you'll want to be sure that you point out your willingness to relocate. Some jobs allow people to work remotely, so relocation may not be required. You'll need to work out the specific details with your prospective employer. The Interview Process Recruiters like to interview you before sending your resume around. Good ones will stay in touch with you and prep you for the interview - tell you about positions they found and what the hiring manager is looking for. They'll ask you how the interview went after it's done, and they'll give you feedback from the hiring manager so you have greater success next time. The hiring company may want to do a phone interview first. They may want to do two. Sometimes three. These interviews may take 1 to 3 hours, depending upon the company and who you speak to. They'll often want to do an in-person interview, either at an office near you with people who are qualified to interview you, or by flying someone to you, or by flying you out to meet them. If they fly you out, you may expect a per diem payment to cover food and incidentals, and they'll pay for the flight. If they like you but you're not right for the particular position, you may be internally referred within the company and go through the interview process all over again. Crossing State Borders Travel between the states has no special regulations, but you should be aware that there are a lot of laws that change. For example, in CA, you have a right to work and a non-compete clause is unenforceable, but it's probably enforceable in the rest of the US. In the different states, the traffic laws are a little different, so you should familiarize yourself with the local traffic laws. Same thing for hunting, fishing, and some other activities.
