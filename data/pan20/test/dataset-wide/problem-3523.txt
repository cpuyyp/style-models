Your primary nutrition should be from food. Protein powder as the name suggest are supplements, if you are using them as food, it may come up with side-effects. Regarding your coach, it's time to get a new one. You are a beginner, and with proper diet, nutrition, rest and workout, you can see benefits, not just by pumping yourself with protein powder. It's obvious that your coach is trying to sell you stuffs, or has something to do with the product supplier. I have known such people personally, who egg newbies to goon high dosage of protein. Build your stamina slowly by doing cardio. Nothing comes overnight magically, and you shouldn't be expecting it. Remember,your journey towards good health is a marathon, not a short sprint. 

Wait till you fully recover and 100% fit to carry on your workout. If the injury hasn't healed properly(soreness is an indication to that), then you may risk further damage. Also, consult with your doctor and take his advice on this. 

I have just been given an abs toner belt, and would like to know if these actually do anything or not? Should I waste my time and use it or just put it away in a cupboard and forget about it. The one I have been given is "Slendertone Flex Max Unisex Toning Belt", it was bought for some one and they never used it so they have given it to me, so it hasn't cost me anything. Any advice would be great. Thanks 

I broke my Collar Bone back at the beginning of April which resulted in me having an operation to repair the damage and have a metal plate put in. I was given the all clear to return to the gym yesterday and told I could do weights again as long as I didn't over do it. Does anyone have any advise to the type of exercises I could do that will not damage my shoulder any more but will help me still build muscle again? 

Below are a few links that you may find useful when it comes to deciding what kinda nutrition suits you. $URL$ $URL$ Note: just use the above as reference, not as a rule, as every individual is different so are the needs based on body-type , weight and size, but what applies as a generic thing is, to keep supplying your body with constant feeding on energy. You can't gain muscles magically out of noting, so eating right is what you need to do. Also, try out different nutrition techniques see what works the best for you. 

It's not the question of wrong or right, but what works for you. The conventional regime is to workout back and biceps and chest with triceps. When you are working on your chest, you are already moving your triceps, they get secondary workout. So stressing them again with back workout may not work for everyone. Ideally the rest time is 48 hours, for a set of muscles, but having said that, people are built differently when it comes to what their bodies can handle. I know some people who have been doing everything on a single day for last 5 years, and it's working for them. So, I'd say try out various routines and see what works for you. 

Fiber is, by definition, indigestible carbohydrate. It either gets processed by the bacteria in your colon or it goes on to the exit. If your gut flora uses it, the "good" bacteria will produce some vitamins and short-chain fatty acids from it (which you metabolize and are good for you) plus some toxins, and the "bad" bacteria will just create toxins. Insoluble fiber (e.g. grains) will scratch the insides of your gut. Personally, I avoid it. Cows are mammals that are masters at handling fiber. Their natural diet gives them, after fermentation, almost 70% from energy as short-chain fats. Gorillas have a really big hindgut and also get most of their energy through fermentation. We humans lack the three stomachs and/or very long gut and therefore can't handle as much fiber. Furthermore there are several examples of populations that eat no fiber at all and nevertheless are healthy (like the Masai and Inuit). So in conclusion, fiber gives bulk to your stool as well as giving you some extra energy as fat and if you're eating too much of it, inflammation. It is not something to avoid, and not something to seek out. Bloating and gas probably means that your gut flora is having a field day at your expense. 

All you need to do is eat clean and eat regularly. If you are not working out, make sure you don't eat more than what you actually require. The idea is to keep the complete nutrition in mind. Make sure the sources you pick, provide you with all the necessary nutrients for your body to get nourished and stay in proper condition. I don't know what your prior eating habits were like, but if you were into junk, and unhealthy food, then cut those as much as possible. I know it's just hard, but to lead a healthy lifestyle, you need to give up certain stuffs. If you can't resist the craving, keep it down to 1 day a week, but eat those in limit. Drink plenty of water and rest well. Maintain good hygiene which is very important. Above all, have a positive mindset and just focus on the goal. Once you attain it, maintain it. Don't spiral down back to where you started. Wish you the best. 

Like yourself I work with computers and I put a lot of weight on sat in front of them eating chocolate bars and drinking fizzy drinks, I got to a silly weight of 320lbs and realized I needed to do something when my family and friends would make jokes (Horrible family and friends I know, haha) but it wasn't until I met someone that I really realized I had to change call her my motivation if you will. Hear are my nutritional, diet and workout plans I did. This is was my standard 6 week on 1 week of program for some time. 

This would be my standard work out when I started as you can see I didn't really have a plan except for losing weight, I did have rest days they have always been Wednesdays and Saturdays. I started in November 2012 at 320lbs and I am now 194.007lbs. Losing the weight has opened up so much for me I have since joined the Police as a Special Constable and I start 2 weeks ago Mixed Martial Arts training but some might say I might not have her but I do. We are best friends and has stood by me through thick and thin I am just not good enough for her yet.. Ok I'm getting into personal things. Back on topic Since losing the weight my main focus when in the gym is now weight training so I have a routine and supplements (Protein, Creatine, etc) but since your just wanting to lose weight I'm not going into that but I read a few articles on here and hopefully they will help you. Don't think it will happen over night/days or even weeks it is a very long drawn out process months to years. I would recommend finding something that will motivate you so when your feeling down (because you will) you can focus on mine was a girl I love, yours could be your kids, wife. But don't get into a set mind you're doing it for them it is you you're doing it for. Good Luck 

image source:$URL$ As you can see, a 2 pulley system has divided the tension in the string into 3 parts. This may not be exactly your case, but how in general pulleys work. So, in the figure, the force required to lift the 150N object would be a little above 50N, which is 1/3 the force required to lift the object directly. Same principle with some variation is applied to the pull-down machines. When you stack up the machine with your body weight equivalent weight, you are not really lifting your body weight, but a part of it. What's that percentage, it depends on how the pull-down machine is configured with pulleys. Nonetheless, the effort to lift will be lesser compared to pure pull-ups. 

First of all, both have different range of motion, you don't do the lateral pull-downs the way you do pull-ups, but let's not go into detail of that, and focus on the main physics. You find it easier to do lat pull-down, that's because of the pulleys. Below diagram gives and illustration of how pulleys work. 

Weight loss is still poorly understood. What's certain is that if you starve yourself, you will lose weight, and if you massively overeat for a sustained period of time, you will gain weight. Everything in between is less predictable. Our body isn't stupid, if it detects an imbalance it will correct it. Eating only this cereal might make you thin, or it might make you fat. It might also make you deficient in whatever this cereal doesn't provide. One of the ideas gaining popularity is that human beings aren't broken by default, and that something about our diet causes our body to get overweight (and eventually sick). Exactly what causes it is unknown, but large doses of wheat, fructose and Omega-6 poly-unsaturated fats as well as highly processed foods have been fingered as the culprits. Paleo dieters avoid these things (and call them Neolithic Agents of Disease :-) ) and the body returns to a more natural equilibrium. Personally, I first lost weight and then gained muscle and energy avoiding these NADs, without counting calories so I'm convinced that my regular diet was not healthy. I ate mostly a standard american diet with an extra helping of sweets. This cereal doesn't look too highly processed, but personally I wouldn't eat it because of the wheat content and because there are so many other foods that are much yummier.
