I recently returned to strength training after years of only cardio. Today I mostly exercise with bodyweight and TRX, trying to avoid the muscle isolation method of classic free weigh exercises. Back in the day when I did free weight training at the gym, I remember always having thin biceps, unproportioinal to a well developed triceps and upper body muscles. Now I seem to be facing the same problem again, my biceps are not developing well and are visibly thin and unproportional to the rest of my body. For the back and biceps I do Pull-Ups, TRX High Row and TRX Bicep Curl (without twisting motion until now). After some research I found out that the inner, short head of the bicep is responsible for twisting the forearm clockwise (from POV). I added a twist motion to the TRX Bicep Curl, and I added Dumbbell Curls. Are there any other methods or exercises to "thicken" your biceps? 

I understood that people who train for mass (a.k.a bodybuilders) have a different muscle composition then people who train for strength (a.k.a powerlifters). Bodybuilders have more non-contractive tissue in their muscles. I was wondering, if a both will stop exercising, will a bodybuilder loose muscle mass faster than powerlifter? 

Some background: I have been working out in the gym for more than a year now after previous experience of 3 years during high-school. Also I have been running for 9 years, used to run half a marathon some 5 years back from now. I am 29, 1.83 meter (6 foot), 86 kg (200 pound), about 15 percent body fat. I started with free weights in the 18+ rep range (due to an injury) and gradually moved to the 4-8 rep range, also I incorporate a lot of body-weight exercises. Now I do strength training for 2-3 times a week for about 90 min (including warm-up and stretching), everything is in super-sets, and run 2-3 times a week for 30 min, mostly high intensity interval running. My goal is strength, calisthenics skill, and overall fitness and health. I do not take any supplements except from an sports drink (Isostar). So far I improved strength and physique and mastered some difficult calisthenics exercises, added about 8 kg (~17 pounds) while remaining lean, and I am happy with my progress. The problem I am facing: I am consuming large and growing amounts of food. I am not stuffing myself forcefully, I actually have an insane appetite, and it takes a lot of food to satisfy it. I eat healthy whole foods most of the time. This has literally became a time and energy consuming issue, I have to cook a lot, when I take food with me during the day it usually wont suffice and I buy some extra. And when I finally feel full I usually consumed so much that it makes me tired and heavy. Preparing and eating lots of small meals isn't an option due to time shortage. Also my metabolism send's me to the bathroom after each meal I consume, so you can understand why I am not excited about eating many small meals. I am sure that this appetite is a result of training, because it usually lasts 3 days after the last workout. If I stop training, after about 5 days my appetite decreases and I eat half the food I usually do. The question: Will supplementing some of my food intake with a workout supplement allow me to decrease the amount of food I have to consume daily? Would you advice to do so? I would like to drink something that has high nutritional value and eat reasonable amounts of food. Also, will I have to drink it for a few days after exercising, or just after my workout? 

People hold body fat in different proportions throughout their body. Weight is not a gauge of your aesthetics or overall level of fitness. Some body builders at your height weigh over 200 lbs but their body fat is incredibly low so they don't look fat. If your goal is to have a flat stomach and thin thighs, plain and simple you have to reduce your body fat percentage. You can't reduce body fat in one area and not others; the human body fat scales proportionally. This comes through consistent dieting for a long period of time and frequent exercise. The body's response to this is also different for each person. Some people can very easily loose body fat with minimal effort and some people have to work harder but it is never impossible. So in general don't get frustrated if you don't see results in three weeks. It usually takes about eight to really notice a significant difference. In reference to how long you have to exercise, that really depends on your health level and if it is even safe for you to engage in it. If you are in relatively average shape start with 30 minutes a day. Then as it gets easier through the weeks add more time or intensity (try working out harder). Keep changing your routine every few weeks (try running outside when you get bored of the machine or doing calisthenics if you can't get to a gym); your body will become accustomed to doing this type of exercise very quickly and your results will start to lag. Most importantly, challenge yourself. Your body won't change if it doesn't have a need to; create that need through your intensity and intervals of training. The main thing is diet, however. You can work out for 10 hours a day but if you aren't eating the right foods consistently every day, week after week then you won't see any change. Good Luck, Hope that helps and feel free to ask any questions. 

It really depends on which supplement you are taking. If it is a nitric oxide supplement with green tea extract in it for instance, at least from personal and anecdotal evidence you tend to get less exhausted during your workout and as a result you can do more volume and/or greater intensity. That comes from the way the body breaks down Nitric Oxide. The caffeine keeps you alert and raises your heart rate. Note though that taking it for long periods of time does tend to reduce your level of intensity during your workouts (Again anecdotal, not true for everyone). Taking it after a workout may help your body circulate nutrients better but don't quote me on that, I'm not a doctor. I do however know that some pre-workouts come loaded with L-arginine and some other amino acids which help with recovery time. So if you want you could take a pre-workout afterward and you can see some benefit but the question is why would you do that when you can get a supplement designed specifically for that purpose and save your money? In reference to your green tea question, theoretically consuming green tea or green tea supplement has numerous health benefits (Vitamin C, helps skin, high fluoride content for you bones, helps lower cholesterol, the list goes on for days) regardless of your timing, so its not unsafe to say it may assist in your recovery. Consuming it prior to your workout will yield the results I stated above, essentially a better quality workout because of the caffeine content but you don't have the added effects of the nitric oxide. Consuming it afterward would keep your metabolism up after your workout is ended but its negligible if you are doing any kind of cardiovascular training as studies show your metabolism stays in a higher state for hours after your workout anyway. So at that point you would be taking it for the nutritional value and to stay awake. So no matter what you are benefiting. Know that it does contain caffeine and like any drug/herb your body gets used to it and will require more for the same effect; in your case the pre-workout alertness feeling. As far as a difference between drinking a pre-workout versus regular green-tea, that is more of a personal preference. Taking a pre-workout consistently for a long period of time is not exactly great for your liver and kidneys depending on which brand you choose. You may also become dependent on it to get you through your daily gym routine which is also not good. Finally the affects tend to become less noticeable after extended periods of time. It is also more expensive than green-tea and does not have the same nutritional value. At least with green tea when your body adapts to consuming that level of caffeine you still benefit from the other nutrients in it. (That is not to say there are no nutrients in pre-workout supplements) Should you avoid a pre-workout completely? That is up to you but there is nothing wrong with keeping some around the house for days when you don't feel like training or you feel sluggish. Should you drink green-tea before and/or after? It is once again personal preference and there are numerous health benefits so it can't hurt your recovery. So in summary, get both if you want. Drink your natural green tea every day (before and after is fine as long as you don't have heart problems) and keep some pre-workout around for those days when you feel lazy. Try not to take the pre-workout every day though. I hope that helps, sorry it was so long but you asked a very multifaceted question. 

I run very slow. Most of my friends run 5 km around 20 minutes but I need 23 minutes at race speed. When I run with my friends together, I always lag behind them whenever an upward slope / stairs are encountered. My friends seem to not lose speed when going up the slope, however, for me I think it is natural for the speed to be reduced as physical phenomenon. My ankles feel very stressed whenever I run, and get pain after long (starting from 8 km) runs, coming with swollen feet, exactly like this article describes ($URL$ Therefore I am afraid of long runs, and my longest race is only 10 km in about 48.5 minutes. However, the pain and swell can be relieved by jumping into the sea and float for 10 - 15 minutes. I tried to run along a coast highway, and for about 8 km each I went down to a beach and floated on the sea until my ankle pain disappeared, and continue running, and ran 20 km in total on that day. Adding salt to the insult, the pain comes almost immediately if I try to run uphill or on uneven ground, probably because of increased stress on my ankle, therefore I never do any cross-country race but I cannot avoid it in my orienteering. Some of my friends start, stop and turn very fast in their run, i.e. have great acceleration. However, if I need to run long, I must start my run slowly with only little acceleration, otherwise I will get exhausted very soon. For comparison, a bus always start much slower than a motorcycle. In my 10 km race, I think I used nearly a km until I reached cruise speed. I cannot tolerate heat. Even though I can run 10 km at the above speed in winter, in summer (e.g. at 32℃ 80% humidity) I can't run anywhere near the above speed for ANY distance. If I attempt to run at the race speed, I will become overheat in less than 1 km and have to stop. In contrast, I always run with sleeveless and athletic short even under 10℃ and get sweating if I run hard enough when my friends are already wearing t-shirt. The same holds in swimming as well, the so-called "swimming season" in my region is April to October but I seldom swim in July to early September because the water temperature is SO DAMN HOT, like 29℃ sea temperature under the afternoon sun, where I cannot tolerate and must exit the water maybe only 100 to 200 m of swimming. The pool is worse than, the water temperature can reach 32℃ where heat stroke is a real concern. However, I LOVE swimming out-of-season when the water temperature goes below 24℃, and swim for an hour in the middle of winter where the water temperature is only 16℃. Fat is a good insulator of heat, does that mean I am too fat if I can swim comfortably in the middle of winter?
