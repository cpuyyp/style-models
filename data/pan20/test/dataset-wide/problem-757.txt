It seems clear to me that this is a homework question. I believe what the question is after is to look at the equations for distances in the universe as a function of curvature and see how this curvature affects things. Read, for example, sources like this one or this one. As with most of things in cosmology, there's lots of equations and many ways to write them. A relevant equation would be the following angular diameter distance: $$D_M = (1+z)^{-1} \begin{cases} \frac{1}{\sqrt{\Omega_k}}\sinh\left(\sqrt{\Omega_k}D_c/D_H\right), & k = -1 \\ D_c, & k = 0 \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{\left|\Omega_k\right|}}\sin\left(\sqrt{\left|\Omega_k\right|}D_c/D_H\right), & k = +1 \\ \end{cases} $$ In this case, you can see the three forms it takes for a closed universe ($k=-1$), a flat universe ($k=0$), and an open universe ($k=+1$). It should be pretty clear that if you chose some volume with some radius calculated by $D_A$, you'd get different volume sizes and thus different amounts of galaxies in each volume for the three universe types. By looking at the equations and playing around with them, you should be able to convince yourself which universe type results in the largest volume. 

To put a formal answer to this question, a black hole made of anti-matter would be indistinguishable from a matter black hole. Black holes are dubious objects, but it seems likely that it makes no sense to talk about an "anti-matter black hole" as once the matter goes into the black hole, be it matter or anti-matter, it ceases to have properties that define it as matter or anti-matter. The No-Hair Theorem for black holes states that, among a few other properties, a black hole is defined only by it's mass and net charge. The matter state of individual particles which fell into the black hole play no part in that description. In fact, there is a vigorous debate as to whether or not "information" is conserved for black holes. E.g., if an anti-matter particle fell into a black hole, could you, at a later time, pull out a particle of the same properties or would you get out something of completely randomly new properties, not tied to the original matter. This in part plays into your question because it indicates that there is still a lot of uncertainty regarding the loss of information (including if the particle is anti-matter or matter) as particles fall into a black hole and whether not feeding anti-matter into a black hole actually makes it an anti-matter black hole or just simply a black hole. 

Your question for "space" news sites is somewhat vague as space can cover a wide variety of topics. I have found Innerspace.net to be a nice blog/news source primarily concerning itself with the space exploration and technology aspects of space. It often reports on recent launches (such as those by Space X), advancements in space technologies, and space ventures by other countries outside the US such as China and Russia. If you're looking for more sciencey topics of a higher caliber, try something like Science Daily. While this covers a variety of scientific fields, it does also cover space news. In general, this site is a curation of articles by various sources. Usually each article is linked to some specific scientific research or published paper. 

It is important to understand how this process works. The method described in your article is known as Bistatic Radar. In effect, a transmitter sends out a signal (generally a radio telescope in the microwave region) which hits the surface of some body and bounces off to be received back on Earth by a second, separate radio telescope. Now, because a microwave's wavelength is so long ($\sim 0.1-100\:cm$) the microwaves don't bounce off from the exact surface, but instead are able to penetrate slightly into the subsurface before being reflected. This means the receiver gets a reflection of the subsurface of the body. In the case you linked, they used the Arecibo Telescope to provide the transmitted signal to the Moon and the Green Bank Telescope to receive the signal. A similar process could be done to other bodies besides our Moon. However, you run into the problem that the farther away an object is, the harder it will be to detect the returning signal. I believe that most objects within our solar system (and certainly all objects outside it) are outside the distance where this method will work. I was able to find an instance where someone used this method for an asteroid that passed by the Earth at a distance 11 times that of the Moon. I'm not sure what the limit is to how far away something must be before this method no longer works, but I imagine it wouldn't work even for Mars unless we seriously upgrade our technology and power. Of course your question seems to presuppose the transmitter and receiver are both on Earth. If your transmitter is much closer, say a satellite orbiting that planet, then it is certainly feasible. Here is a source which discusses the concept of using Bistatic Radar probing via a satellite, which also goes into the history a bit on what has been done before. 

As it turns out though, astronomers are thinking about these things. There was recently a paper published almost on this very topic. Check out Irma & Stefano (2017) where they discuss trying to find planets around X-ray binaries that may potentially house a SBH. 

The reason is because of Earth's global magnetic field. Take a look at the image below which shows a representation of what the magnetic field lines around Earth look like. 

Ultimately, you're asking what $N$ and $\ell$ are such that $\tau=1$, since this would be the point where the refraction stops and you don't see any more of the rings. Unfortunately, this is difficult to answer based on that image alone. At best you can look up a radial density profile for Saturn such as in Nagy et al. 2009 (ref. fig. 8.1). Note in that paper, they refer to height as the height above the 1 bar pressure level. This paper also gives you an idea for common atoms within the upper atmosphere and you can look up $\sigma$ for these atoms. Predominantly though, I imagine hydrogen will dominate the interactions so using the cross section of hydrogen will be a good approximation. Then assume some sort of approximate path length $\ell$ based on the geometry (maybe use the formula for chord length). Putting actual numbers into this problem could be a research project all to its own, but you can play around with what you consider to be good values for $N$ and $\ell$ such that you're constrained by the fact that $\tau=\sigma N\ell=1$. 

I know this is an old question, but recent developments in astronomy have caused this to become relevant again. Early in 2016 there was a paper published by Konstantin Batygin and Michael E. Brown (here) which indicates the possible existence of a new planet, dubbed "Planet 9". Subsequent work by other authors have lent more evidence to its possible existence, e.g., a paper by Fienga et al. (here) which concludes that including Planet 9 in orbital dynamic models decreases residuals. This being said, the original paper specifically states 

As stated above, all bodies orbit the barycenter. The location of the barycenter depends on the masses of all the bodies in the system and will be closest to the most massive body. Think of the barycenter as a weighted mean of the positions of all the bodies, where the weight is the respective body's mass (because that's exactly what it is). That's just how the math works out. It is impossible then for the objects in a stellar system to orbit a less massive body as the barycenter could never be closest to that body.
