How do I remove my old (Shimano Sora) brake callipers (dual pivot) and replace them with new (Shimano 105 5800) callipers? (This is the bike if you want to know more components details). 

I have been looking online for a while on how to fix a bug with my Garmin Edge 510 Cadence/Speed sensor but no luck, and now I'm indoors training it's more important that it works (so I can get "speed" data to approximate power). It often drops out as in this ride and this ride for example. It seems I'm not the first to encounter this problem but I'm struggling to find a solution. Is there a fix? 

Most importantly, carefully read the instructions included with the new callipers before fitting, don't just follow the guide above. 

I'm looking at buying the new Shimano 105 5800 equipment for my bike. It is a 2010 Specialized Allez (Sport Triple) and still has its basic Sora components that it came with. I asked my local bike shop how much it would cost to buy & fit (6400 sek, ~€700 of which roughly $50 was the labour). Looking online, Wiggle sells the groupset at ~€400, and Chainreactioncycles at ~€450. If I can equip myself with the right tools for significantly less than the €300 saving it makes sense for me to DIY. My questions: What tools will I need to buy to be able to completely overhaul? What other tools are recommended to make it easier? (e.g. cable crimpers are better than regular pliers..) 

I would like to purchase this hub, rim and suitable spokes, but I am not able to find dimensions of this hub necessary to calculate spoke size. I have checked usual places where such information can be found, but without success. Does anyone own this hub, and has taken its measures? 

26" wheels are stronger than 28" wheels but I think you can get 28" wheel suitable for your weight that will last. Whatever size you choose I would advise you to invest in your rear wheel instead of using stock wheel you get from the shop. Buy strong rim suitable for 36 spokes, find a reputable wheel builder in your area, and ask him to build a wheel with quality spokes. Also if you are buying new bicycle, make sure your position on it is ok. If you are for instance sitting to far back, that will affect weight distribution, and your rear wheel will have to bear even more stress. There are more options to make stronger rear wheel, like using 40 or more spokes, wider rear axle, non dished rear wheel with internal hub, etc But all these require significantly larger investment than just getting strong well built rear wheel. 

The shock you are referring to was marketed as a 'brain' shock I think. The worked by varying the damping based on detected rear wheel movement. As far as I remember only specialized sold them, first produced for them by Fox and then an in house model. They typically appeared on more XC orientated designs and I've never seen one available as a separate retail product. Fox have been working on a very similar concept using electronics instead of a remote 'brain' to vary the damping. See $URL$ for more info.

I'm not a 100% sure however I think the 'spring' in those forks was actually elastomers. The linked Suntour fork appears to have the correct steerer type (threaded) and the steerer is long enough. A big problem though is the axle to crown length of the fork as it is 100m travel. It is likely that the Suntour fork that you linked to will be significantly longer than the originals. This can lead to undesirable handling and more importantly could cause the head tube to snap off the frame due to the increased loads. The Amazon listing shows the axle to crown length of the Suntour fork. Measure yours and compare the values. To measure extend the fork to its full length and measure from the centre of the axle to the underside of the crown race. The crown race sits on top of the fork's crown and runs against the bearings. In the top down picture is is the stepped silver circle between the steerer and the dirt on the crown. You do not need to measure this as it is part of the headset. In the linked fork the crown race measurement of 30mm is the same as 1" 1/8. You can reuse the current bearings. To do this you will need to (carefully) remove the crown race from the current forks and fit it to your new forks. In my opinion it will probably be easier to find a suitable rigid fork than a replacement suspension fork. If you do replace the forks I suspect that the original Marzocchi item might be worth attempting to sell on. In my country (UK) there is a strong market for retro parts, even broken. 

There are many styles of bicycle racks available. If you are concerned with space they use, you could check Vertical bike rack which can provide high density of parked bicycles in small space. 

Unfortunately, it is less exact process than you hope for. Most important thing would be to locate reputable wheel builder who will build wheels for you. It can be an advantage if he is local to you. If there are some guys you know that went on the large tour of tenths of thousands of km, ask them who built their wheels. Wheel builder would spec the wheel components according to your weight and riding style, from components he is accustomed to build. He would probably spec something along these: 

I have shifter with damaged housing. It shifts well, but I guess if housing is not repaied, rain and elements will quickly put an end to it. Which material would be suitable to fix this hole? Epoxy glues? Maybe ones with metal filler? Are there some sensitive parts in the damaged area that I should be carefull not to glue? 

As others have pointed out studded tires are most effective against ice. As for weight on front wheel, yes it is important to have some. But you do not want to lean heavy and make your hands heavy and stiff. You want them to be light, quick to react and precise. You also want your upper body to be flexible and quick to react. 

I took out my wheel for a puncture and when the wheel went back on the bike the gears were out of line, a lot of skipping and jumping. What is the best way to get them back in alignment (must be possible at the road side)? Is there a tip on how to reinsert the wheel so it stays in alignment? Or is it a case of getting the wheel back in and adjusting the derailleur to realign? (On a road bike with tiagra rear d) 

I am trying to workout whether the park tool PCS 9 workstand would fit in my bath tub (it's the only place I can clean my bike). To do so I need to know how big the footprint of the stand is. Could someone measure theirs for me? Approximately it's the distances in this image along the red lines... 

Looking at the Cervelo S5 series there are two different models but the Cervelo page offers no mention of what differences are.. could someone enlighten me? Looking just at the framesets is there a difference? 

I am trying to get hold of some figures for accident rates where either, ideally just cyclists or, just general road users & pedestrians, are involved in accidents (or reported near misses) because a motorist/cyclist has been using a mobile phone. I would like (if possible) to have information regarding Sweden and other countries where cell phone use is not banned, and in countries where it has been banned such as the UK. As a cyclist who lived in the UK and now lives in Sweden I notice a considerable difference in my "near miss" rate, and the vast majority of my near misses here come from phone users (and bus drivers, but that was the same in GB!). If I can get some statistics I am going to look in to campaigning my local politician and having cycling friends in the area note down their near miss rates (how many kilometers per evasive action). Examples of the sort of nice stats I'm looking for: xx% of accidents involving cyclists in Sweden are suspected or proven to be due to one or more parties involved using a cell phone at the time of the accident. Since banning the use of cell phones the overall rate of accidents involving cyclists has decreased by xx% in the UK, and those involving cell phones has decreased from aa% to bb% 

Currently I weight around 300 lbs, ride bicycle daily 10-20km, and did not have flat for months. Yes you need decent tires, and you have to inflate them properly. Search the web for the puncture resistant tires, and choose one that has best reputation. They cost much more than bargain tires, but when you factor in how much it cost to change inner tubes every few days and frustration associated with it, they are an bargain. Secondly, every tire has to be properly inflated, and the proper pressure is often printed on the tire. I am inflating my Marathon Plus to maximum recommended 6.0 bars. It would be good to check your rim as well, maybe there are some small metal splinters flying around them and causing the flats. Also check you rim tape, and if all spokes are flat and not piercing towards the tube. Keep up, cycling will be fun once you get over these initial obstacles. 

Most people would agree that at the point you have a new frame, you have new bicycle. In that sense your question might be rephrased: "how can I purchase new bicycle and minimize cost by using some of parts from the old one". To do so, you need to make a list of parts that you think are good on the old one, including type of parts and assessment of their value. Then you go to shop some other old bicycle that has bad or lacking parts that you have. In theory this sounds good, but in practice it takes a lot of time and looking of old bicycles to find suitable purchase candidate. That is because you need new bicycle that will be compatible with parts you have. For instance if you have good 6 speed shifter, you should be looking for bicycle with 6 speed rear hub. It is not a rocket science, but there is some room to make mistakes, and in the end spend more money that you have intended to. But it is definitely a learning experience! 

I've used cleat covers before and, though they protect the cleat, didn't feel they were a proper solution - you still end up walking weirdly because the only contact point is the cleat. 

I've just been doing some hill repeats and killing the boredom I got thinking, what is the best position to be in when braking hard (emergency stop, coming downhill etc.)? Obviously you want to keep the back wheel from lifting off the ground. For example, I could lean over the handlebars (stupid but its illustrative) sit in the middle of the saddle, sit on the back of the saddle, or hang off the back beyond the saddle... What is the most effective way to transfer weight on to the back wheel? (On a road bike) 

Recently I've been getting notifications on my edge 510 of an upcoming segment (& and display when riding through it) - I can turn this off by hitting the red cross on screen when it comes up, but I'd like to completely disable this function and can't work our how. Any ideas? 

I'm looking for online suppliers of carbon road framesets, the major online retailers Wiggle, Evanscycles and Chainreactioncycles don't seem to have much choice available (~<10 each) with low diversity in brands. What other (reputable) suppliers are present in the online market that have a large range of products to chose from? Or do framesets tend to be bought directly from the manufacturer? I ask because most brands are missing entirely and some (e.g. Specialized) only have one or two of their frames available through these sites, yet they don't sell them directly, therefore I think I'm not looking in the right places. (I am based in Sweden if you want to limit it to Europe/European delivery)
