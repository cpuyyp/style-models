Not a total extinction, mind you. Just how long do you think it would take for the residents of a small town of survivors to notice? Obviously this varies from place to place and ecosystem to ecosystem, so let's give them the best chance for survival in the prolonged cold of a nuclear winter and say this is a town in the Canadian wilderness (or the Minnesota wilderness depending on where you are on the border). How long would it take after a large-scale nuclear exchange (maybe a few thousand bombs?) for people in that town to notice stuff like larger animals (bears, moose, cougars) dying off and how long would it take for smaller animals (squirrels, rabbits, mice, birds, freshwater fish) to die off? Would any of these animal populations ever die off completely in that area, or would their numbers just go down? 

Now everyone agrees that when it comes to building orbital habitats, let alone a full-blown Dyson swarm with millions, maybe even billions of liveable habs in orbit around the Sun or the various planets, a certain amount of self-sufficiency is both required and inevitable, both in terms of resources and in the hab's local politics and methods of governance. Like nation-states, what's illegal in one hab may be accepted or even endorsed in another, and many fringe political or religious groups may choose to build small habs simply so they can express their own beliefs and live according to them away from persecution or prying eyes. However, while local governance is good and all for dealing with local problems, it must equally be agreed upon that some sort of diplomatic body, and preferably even a full-blown law enforcement/peace-keeping service, should exist to regulate how habs are allowed to interact with each other politically, economically, and in worst case scenarios, even militaristically. In order to effectively keep the peace between the habs, you'd need the swarm equivalent of Interpol and the UN to keep an eye on things like trade agreements, peace treaties and non-aggression pacts, and criminal activity against both citizens of different habs and against the habs themselves. Total anarchy is fine as long as it's contained to a few habs, but while a few lawless or deviant nations are acceptable when set against the larger swarm, the entire thing can't be allowed to be completely without laws or government or the whole thing will fall apart. You may be too far to easily enforce your will on the people of other habs, but you're still nowhere near far enough to escape the consequences of doing so. But if autonomy is the de facto state of orbiting habitats, then how would you effectively run such a system-spanning body of government and law enforcement, loose as it may or may not be? Alastair Reynolds provides a great example with Panoply and the Glitter Band in his book The Prefect, but I want to avoid ripping him off and even leaving that aside, I can still see a number of problems with his system of swarm governance (even if it is one of the best I've seen in fiction). Does anyone here have any ideas about what political models might work to loosely govern a large number of separate nation-states and how you might enforce it across a distance of multiple light-seconds or light-minutes? 

Like, if you massively accelerated the Moon's orbit or propelled it somehow so that it moved from one side of the Earth to the other in a very short period of time, what effect would that have on the people down on Earth? A lot? Any? 

Assuming a technology is developed that allows people to either eliminate the need to sleep or study/work subconsciously during their regular sleep cycle, what kind of effect would this have on the amount of time it takes to finish your classical education? Could someone finish college and earn multiple phDs by the time they're eighteen if they had an extra 4-8 hours a day to study? I'm writing a bit of a throwaway bit of worldbuilding and wanted to know if this seemed unrealistic but now I'm honestly very curious about the impact of future technologies on education and learning. 

Any kind of annoying pest really, but I chose arthropods because I hate them. And someone else hates them too. Let's say he's some sort of well-intentioned but reckless mad scientist who really needs to think his plans through better. He releases a lab-engineered genophage (probably made using CRISPR) that targets and sterilizes all species of a certain pest or virulent/invasive species. No other animals are affected, but within ten years, the genophage will have spread across the globe and those species will probably all go extinct within twenty years. What kind of fallout are we looking at here? What kind of consequences would suddenly wiping out an entire family or clade of pest species have on the environment and the rest of the global ecosystem? 

Let's say that hundreds of years from now our posthuman descendants finally do good on NASA's promises and build an Alcubierre drive or a true reactionless drive (either one works for this example). Great! Now we can traverse the stars! And if any uppity aliens show up and try to get fresh with us, we can just use our ship's drive as an infinitely powerful weapon with utterly arbitrary destructive potential to blow them, their planet, and even their solar system to bits if we wanted. But would we want to? Fortunately or not so fortunately for our descendants, it's not too difficult to spot the major flaw in having an infinitely powerful weapon. You could never fire it, even in the vacuum of space, because all that energy has to go somewhere, and it may as well be the person, ship, or planet the weapon is being fired by (as well as everything else within a few light hours of you). This is absolutely unavoidable, unless the weapon is truly of a bizarre and exotic nature and doesn't inflict damage via thermal or kinetic energy, much like the hypometric weapons from Alastair Reynold's Revelation Space series. So having said that, my next question is of course going to be "how do you avoid that?" Assuming you could weaponize a Q-thruster or the kind of Alcubierre drive that accumulates massive amounts of energy inside the warp bubble, would there be any way to protect the person(s) firing the weapon that isn't purely wild speculation (and by that I mean even more wildly speculative than Q-thrusters or warp drives)? I assume not, but I'm no physics expert. 

What factors would be working to damage or erode them and how long could they conceivably last? Would making them airtight help in any way, or would the contents last longer in a vacuum (assuming you could vent the atmosphere without letting water in)? 

It's very possible, but you need some specific conditions. For animals and invertebrates, your ideal environment for gigantism is low gravity (perhaps half-Earth or lower), high oxygen content, and if you really want to be on the safe side, an evolutionary history that resulted in either very large, squat animals or towering giants with bones and tissue made of some sort of naturally-occurring supermaterial, like graphene or TMDCs (these don't occur naturally on Earth but nothing strictly prohibits it from happening). This is because the square cube law makes it both more difficult for bones to support the animal's mass and harder for muscles to exert the force needed to pump blood throughout the body as its weight increases exponentially in proportion to its linear increase in size. For trees, they can already get pretty gigantic on our planet but if you want them really big, just apply the conditions I already mentioned and then give the trees something plants on our planet don't have: a circulatory system, to help push nutrients up towards the top of the tree against the pull of gravity. 

Okay so I have a sci-fi world masquerading as a fantasy world where numerous different genetically-engineered humanoids live on nine different ringworlds orbiting an artificial Earth-mass black hole (which they see as a "black sun"). The black hole's accretion disk provides light to the ringworlds much like a small star would, but if we take it as a given that these rings all revolve around the black hole at various rotational speeds (like the planets in our solar system do relative to the sun), how would the cultures living on these ringworlds measure time differently? Assuming of course that one ring passing into the shadow created by the ring above or below it (depending on which side of the ring you're living) is analogous to a single night. EDIT: Hmmm... actually you're probably right. I want this whole structure to be Earth-sized so traveling across all the different rings doesn't take much longer than an IRL cross-continental journey apiece, but I also want the black hole to be small enough that the rings don't fall in. Anyone have any suggestions as to what would be an appropriate size that'd balance luminosity and gravity for a planet-sized structure? As for the shape and arrangement of the structure it's similar in concept to the Game of Thrones opening: $URL$ 

Bioluminescence and/or extremely large eyes to take in the almost nonexistent light beneath Europa's ice sheet, or eyeless sockets and a transparent body with senses better equipped to detect minute changes in water pressure? 

In my futuristic dystopian nightmare world, biological and chemical weapons have once again become popular in the theatre of war, and are used both by terrorist groups and militaries alike. Thus, for professional soldiers looking to stay alive on the battlefield, there is a pressing need to dispose of infected corpses. EATR units (robots which turn biomass into combustible fuel) pick up the slack somewhat, but they hardly work quickly enough to minimize your men's exposure to dangerous chemical and viral agents, and good luck cleaning up a crop-dusting or a gassacre (heh) if you only brought one of them. Thus, a new solution to the corpse problem was needed, and flamethrowers once again became a primary tool of warfare. But despite their newfound relevance, the fact remains that asking soldiers to carry a tank full of highly combustible fuel through drone territory and into the crosshairs of snipe-happy enemies isn't exactly safe. So my question for you is how do I make the flamethrower of the future safer for troops to use without making it a strictly vehicle-mounted weapon?
