Assuming you're referring to a means of sustenance produced from cultures such as this, I don't see any reason why it wouldn't be practical, given that such foods have already been through public trials and could potentially be produced inside an appropriately scaled version of this desktop device. However, this says nothing about the nutritional requirements for the culture and it is not clear where those ingredients would come from in your scenario. As for financial independence, providing the most basic needs such as nutrition, basically keeps people from starving. This would hardly make people financially independent unless other basic needs are met, such as clothing, shelter, sanitation - also very important unless you are interested in ruling over a complete mess, very embarrassing and perhaps very violent. It perhaps makes economic sense, in the sense that land that would have been used for farming is now available for other purposes and farms are much harder to tend, more labor intensive, than such an isolated environment as a bioreactor. But it definitely makes social sense because it allows these people the choice to do as they please with their 0.4 acres rather than forcing them to grow on it to survive and feed their children - and 0.4 acres is a dismal lot to farm if that is all you have and you depend on it totally. Farming that small of a plot may not even work in many cases or most cases, depending on the geography, if the people do not have the financial means to buy tools or any kind of technology to help them out. 

They most likely would. Some, as others have suggested, will try to continue and stay out of the way of the Borg, but without warp drive they would be destined to drift away into space and wink out like sparks trying to escape a fire, unprepared for the journey. The Long Version 

The brain processes information on many levels. At lower levels lots of information is integrated and signal passing is mostly lateral, meaning that raw data that comes into our brains first goes through many parallel networks which share the responsibility of filtering out information that is recognized from the raw data and passing the compressed version, the unrecognized portion of the data (unrecognized at the lower levels), up to higher layers which are weighted to try to recognize the parts that were not filtered out at the lower levels. Basically what this means is that there is a hierarchically lower part of our brain that recognizes lines, curves and shading to delineate objects and start to find the field of depth and color. At a higher level those signals integrate so that more complicated features can be recognized such as an eye, or an ear, or a nose or a mouth - but this does not yet form a face, nor does it recognize it, but it is very close. At a higher level, those features integrate into faces. At yet a higher level the concept of a face is determined to belong to a person, but which person depends on what faces we have stored in our memories. New faces, like any other memory are stored in the context of the events that surround them. In other words we have a complex hierarchy of processing and spatio-temporal memory that leads to recognition, but there is a very small and focused portionâ€  of the brain that does the work of taking all of the lower signals and forming a spatio-temporal memory of a face. This is because that process relies greatly on the part of the brain that recognizes an object (to the brain, at this point in the hierarchy, an object is just a small collection of signals from other neurons) as a face. If you can selectively disrupt that very small and fairly regular (across individuals) portion of the brains of observers, then you can hijack their ability to remember your face. My favorite way to do this, with a bit of clever technology, is called Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation. This could perhaps be hand-waved to work as you need in your vicinity while in public. 

Firstly, humanoid robots are considerably more expensive than simpler, more narrowly purposed devices, such as you suggest with drones. The trade-offs for upright gait make evolutionary sense - saving calories while walking in order to reserve those calories for higher consciousness - but not robotic sense. Slithering for example is much simpler; a few parts repeated, attached together, simple algorithm, done deal. Helicopter (quad/hex et al) drones seem to be the sweet spot for utility vs versatility at short range, i.e. hovering, vertical take-off and landing and quick reorientation and maneuverability - vis a vis dragonflies, such that they have survived millions of years. With humans/humanoids the entire equation is different. We evolved large brains and in short order, on evolutionary time scales, have placed ourselves on a path for opting to rid ourselves of our cumbersome, but narrowly advantageous, calorie conserving frames, to go further into the mental spaces, augmenting our brains, storing them, understanding them better. The laughable thing to me is that brains seemed to have evolve for the very purpose of becoming bigger brains. Secondly, mechs are even more complicated and expensive that humanoid robots because they not only have to emulate what a humanoid robot can do, but then they must incorporate a user interface into the equation so that using them is not an uncontrollable affair. The bounding and the jostling and the controlling of the mech must be such that the whole system behaves in a way that is natural to human movement. Otherwise, by requiring the user to work harder than they otherwise would than by simply being deployed on foot, then the proposition becomes too risky, i.e. it equates to throwing a poorly functioning and very expensive piece of equipment and a highly trained soldier along with that expense into a situation where positive results are less likely. So no, in a combat situation, I would say that terminators and other humanoid robots, including mechs are pure fantasy. Edit To clarify the distinction between mechs and augmentative devices such as the exoskelton. A Mech is a fully armored and equipped combat device where as the primary focus of exoskeleton devices is for aiding in ground deployment, e.g. such as helping to carry equipment. Other options such as mechanical mules are included as alternatives to the exoskeleton. The maneuverability and agility necessary in full engagement are the issues which limit the practicability of mechs and increase the requirements and complications for making them feasible. 

Edit Not sure exactly how you would go about it quickly, as you requested, but diverting the flow of money that the government has control over is a sure fire method. Some things could take months to accomplish (doing the ground work), others perhaps years in this way (as it applies in practice). For example, raising interest rates too high will limit borrowing between banks and cut off the flow of money in the economy. This would threaten the banks as well as almost all other industries that need money to keep going and it would perhaps cause runs on banks which subsequently makes markets unstable. Banks make money through lending. Making them unable to do that is a serious problem and would perhaps lead to effects in the amount of time you are interested in. Another point worth noting is that most people do not understand how these things work, so it would take time for people en mass to "catch up", which usually happens long after the fact. And now for the ranting, more protracted and slower moving version. Maybe the two could be combined to good effect.
