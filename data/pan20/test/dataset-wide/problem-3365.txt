As for RCs, Chinese already has another [+case] strategy, the resumptive pronoun, so by paradigmatic economy, coverb stranding is not needed: 

Brainstorming a bit turns up a lot of examples, it seems. Sometimes it will boil down to definition (are demonstratives pro-forms), but even excluding demonstratives, I can think of quite a lot: 

That's why 'the founder of' is not a constituent. The other major concept that needs review is the head. The head of a phrase doesn't have a precise, necessary-and-sufficient-conditions definition, but it does have a bundle of common properties that sometimes, though not always, coincide. In general, the head is the only element that always appears the kind of phrase it heads (except in really special cases like ellipsis), it gets to 'choose' (subcategorise for) its dependents other than adjuncts, and it governs its dependents. As you can see, identifying the head isn't always straightforward, and that's why linguists disagree on whether NP dominates DP or DP dominates NP, or whether complement clauses are CPs or Ss, or whether sentences are IPs or TPs or Ss or something else. Zwicky (1985) lists five different 'head-like notions': 

Though BillJ is right in saying that full NPs have no case in English, I think your question would become valid if we replace the full NPs with personal pronouns: 

Firstly, spoken language is the linguist's primary object of study, although there are (imperfect) analogues of written language in linguists' conception of language. I think these are similar to what you have in mind when you mentioned levels of language. In linguistics, at the lowest level, we have phonetics, which studies the acoustic stream, how it's produced and how it's perceived. Abstracting away from phonetics, phonology looks as sounds as discrete chunks, called phonemes, so e.g. the word 'happy' is made of four chunks (roughly h, a, p, i). It's more abstract than phonetics because sounds in complementary distribution are regarded as different realisations of the same sound. The classic example is the 't' in 'star' and the 't' in 'tea', which are pronounced differently but regarded as different realisations of the same /t/ phoneme. Above the phoneme layer, we have morphology, which looks at morphemes, the smallest meaningful unit. For example, there are two morphemes in the word 'lights': 'light' and 's'. Building meaningful units from meaningless sound segments is an important property of language known as duality of patterning, one of the defining features of language. Morphemes are concatenated to form words, which combine to form phrases and sentences, which are the object of study of syntax, one layer above morphology. So, we have already looked at four different layers of language, and one could 'compile' a higher level of representation into a lower one. A sentence can be reduced to a string of morphemes, then to a string of phonemes, and finally an acoustic stream. That is (somewhat) analogous to, say, a database language compiling to C, then compiling to assembly, then finally turns into machine language (I'm no computer scientist; correct me if I'm wrong here). Written language, which you've mentioned, conveys information roughly parallel to the phonology tier, though to a lesser extent in Chinese than in English and French, which in turn code phonology to a lesser extent than Korean and Spanish. But Korean and Spanish encode less morphology than English and French, which in turn encode less morphology than Chinese. So although you can easily tell between 'meet' and 'meat' in English, 'might' as a modal and 'might' as a noun are written in the same way, whereas in the Chinese writing system, which is nearly one symbol = one morpheme, homophones are usually written with characters that look different. So your symbolic tier seems to map to two different 'levels' in linguists' conception of language: Morphology and syntax. 

Long distance reflexives/anaphora/binding are much discussed in the literature, particularly among generativists, but while there seems to be rough agreement on what constitutes a long-distance reflexive, I can't find a good, theory-neutral definition of it. The general usage seems to be 'a reflexive whose anaphoric distance is longer than what English allows', reflecting the field's traditional anglocentricity, but even that is vague and imprecise. For example, (1) is not acceptable in English: 

Note how in Pintupi, stress falls always falls on odd-numbered syllables whereas in Wargamay, it falls on odd-numbered syllables when there is an even number of syllables and falls on even-numbered syllables when there is an odd number of syllables. We can capture this fact by stating that Pintupi divides syllables into feet from left to right and Wargamay does this from right to left, then both languages assign stress to the first syllable: 

Roughly, when a lot of grammatical categories are at the two ends of this spectrum, you have an analytic language; if a lot of grammatical categories are in-between, you have a synthetic one. When a periphrastic syntactic construction is used a lot, the words used it in will become functional, i.e. used for expressing grammatical meaning, for example while in English (still used in its original, concrete sense in phrases like 'in a while'). When these functional words become unstressed and cliticise to the words afterwards, they become clitics, such as the French article le, from the Latin demonstrative ille. Clitics can then become affixes. For example, the French adverb marker ment is a full clitic these days, but it used to be a clitic in Old French, e.g. [humble e douce]=ment. An affix can later become a suprasegmental; for example, in Old Chinese, *-s was (among other things) a causative suffix, but this later became a tone difference after tonogenesis in Middle Chinese, and some of this is retained in modern Chinese. And finally, an old distinction can simply disappear altogether; this is the cause for some of the Middle Chinese tonal differences. So in effect, the cycle is a fall-out of these diachronic processes in which words tend to be used frequently, become entrenched, enter the grammatical system, and go through successive stages of weakening until they eventually disappear. So how does the final isolating language become agglutinative again? Simple: New words will simply be grammaticalised into the system again. One ongoing example of this is the be going to construction in English. As will becomes more and more grammatical, be going to is replacing will's older, 'more expressive' use. The same thing is happening in French: the aller + infinitive construction is similar to be going to in this respect. These periphrastic constructions will then go through the grammaticalisation process again: the development of gonna in casual speech is the first step in this. To conclude, yes, you're right, the transitions are unidirectional. Yet it is also cyclic, and language change doesn't 'end' at isolating. References (for Indo-European examples): Hopper, P. J., & Traugott, E. C. (2003). Grammaticalization. Cambridge University Press. 

In any event, though linguists frequently disagree on which constituent in a phrase is the head, one thing is clear: In an endocentric constituent, it is always the head that determines the syntactic category of the phrase it heads, and thus a P cannot head a VP. (Note, however, that not all theories require all phrases to be endocentric.) 

In Chinese, certainly. A paratactic vestige from Classical Chinese, it appears in many stock phrases: 

However, the Chinese constructions are more innovative in that the object has been moved to the end of the sentence, for the most part. Yet in most dialects of modern Chinese except Mandarin, complex predicates also sometimes preserve the older V + O + C order similar to the Saramaccan example in (1). This is most common in negative clauses. (The C is what is traditionally termed a complement in Chinese linguistics, but it's more like a satellite in Talmy's sense, and is developed from the 'lighter' verb of an asymmetric serial verb construction). An example from Cantonese is (2): 

In a language I'm studying for a field methods class, the range of tense/aspect/mood marking on verbs seems to be relatively limited in interrogative clauses. For example, in some verbs, a past tense marker must be omitted if the verb is found in a negative interrogative. If it is found in an A-not-A question (the language is not Sinitic but is Sino-Tibetan), then the A part also drops the tense marking. This got me thinking about some questions: 

lemontree has given an excellent answer. I agree with her that you should take another look at the basics, and I think you'd benefit from a quick review of two major concepts: constituency and heads. I'll give a quick summary of two concepts - please consider this a supplement to lemon's answer. :) Describing constituency is the main purpose of syntax trees. The subset of a tree which is dominated by a single node - such as 'of the Church of England', which is a PP in the final version of Tree #1 in lemon's answer - is known as a constituent because it acts as a unit in syntax. We can look for evidence for constituency in various ways, for example: 

Specifically, I'm looking for languages with a [j]/[ɥ] or [j]/[w] alternation that is triggered by the presence of a round vowel. For a hypothetical example with nonce words consider: 

Some additional contributions of mine: Stressed vs unstressed: Nouns, adjectives, lexical verbs, numerals and adverbs in English all carry primary stress, whereas articles don't. Prepositions will go into either category ('of' to the second class, 'over' to the first class). Counterexample: The only one I can think of is that auxiliary verbs are unstressed, but you want them in the first category. Bound vs. free: Words in the first class may stand alone in a phrase: 

Although people these days often gloss bei as 'by', this isn't completely accurate because bei didn't grammaticalise from a preposition; its original meaning was undergo. For example, bei sha would mean 'undergo killing' (i.e. get killed). The agent was just put between bei and the main verb sometime in Middle Chinese (why this happened, I'm not sure). I'm not sure what you'd call this strategy; you could say it's unmarked, since people just inserted the agent there. PS You might want to look up how it works in Austronesian languages - that would be really exciting! It's a pretty complicated phenomenon, so considering that I'm not well-read in it, I won't post anything about it - perhaps others could! EDIT: I just looked up Keenan and Dryer's chapter in Language typology and syntactic description. I found these: In Haya, the agent is just unmarked, like the modern Chinese example I mentioned: 

My impression is that, whereas the grammaticalisation pathways of personal pronouns, agreement markers, auxiliary verbs, case markers, etc. all seem well understood, we know much less about interrogative pro-forms. We know what these guys can turn into (they feature a lot in pseudoclefts and relative clauses), but not much, it seems, about where they originate. The exception, in my view, might be why, since it seems that 'why' is quite transparently derived from 'for what' in a number of languages (pourquoi, wei shenme, etc.) I guess the 'stubbornness' of wh-words might have something to do with it (a lot of PIE roots are retained in Indo-European languages for example). So, what do we know about common grammaticalisation pathways to wh-words? Pointers to relevant literature will be greatly appreciated. 

To illustrate the mechanism, take 'here' in the third example. 'Here' refers to a place which is near; when we remove ourselves from the speech act, that place is no longer near, so we use 'there' - point to a faraway place - instead. A note on terminology: the word 'imperative' is usually used to refer to the syntactic, often formal mood. So for the third sentence, just calling it a 'command' would avoid confusion. 

I assume these are your hypotheses: H0: The verb is passive 92% of the time. H1: The verb is passive 100% of the time. You can't apply a t-test in this case; there's no t-statistic that can be generated. (Typically, when we apply a t-test, it's when we have some point estimate of a variable assumed normal minus the mean under the null hypothesis divided by the standard error, for example in the two-sample t-test or when we test hypothesis about simple linear regression.) Instead, the p-value is simply 0.92^n, since the p-value is the probability that you get the data you have given the null hypothesis (which, in this case, is that the verb is passive 92% pf the time). For a verb with two passive forms, the p-value is 0.92^2 = 0.8464, obviously insignificant. For a verb with sixteen passive forms, the p-value is 0.92^16 = 0.26339, still not significant. At alpha = 0.05, to conclude that a form is deponent, you need log 0.05 / log 0.92, or approximately 36 passive forms; at alpha = 0.1, you need 28. 

Finally, note that the notion of directionality is not a concept inherent in language, but rather a category we invent to describe linguistic phenomena with greater elegance, i.e. it is an artefact of our analyses. 

Whenever you introduce a node in a syntax tree, you should ensure that the material it dominates form a constituent. In your tree, it's not at all clear that 'the founder of' is a constituent. 

and the test therefore does not apply to it. Edit: Givón also mentioned that verbs spread their modal scope over object NPs (p. 304). Since 'a teacher' is not an object, the test doesn't really look at it. 

This strategy is interesting because it's not 'prepositional' like the ones you mentioned. Wang suo sha alone is means 'he whom the king killed'. You can consider this structure a patient nominalisation or a headless object relative clause; either way, the agent is expressed as part of this nominal phrase. So 'literally', the VP translates to 'was a person whom the king killed'. In modern Chinese, this is the construction we use. It is attested since Late Archaic Chinese, but without the agent; the agent only appeared around Middle Chinese: 

Another interesting one from Everett is the connection between ejectives and high altitudes. Everett did not control for phylogeny or do proper statistical analysis, but others have and found that the relationship remains significant. 

You wrote about the claim 'that Chinese words can mostly be used as any part of speech.' While the claim is untrue, I can see why people fall for it. The relationship between lexical word class and how they appear as parts of speech is much more opaque than in English. There is nothing close to a one-to-one correspondence between the two, but it would be a mistake to say that there is no correspondence - that would be akin to saying that x and y are unrelated in circles. In traditional Chinese grammar, the Chinese sentence is made up of six main components:

Prof. Lee and user6726 have given excellent answers above. Though I think the OP's use of semantic criterion isn't completely wrong: The problem is, as Prof. Lee has pointed out above, that he assumes there must be a set of necessary and sufficient conditions that allow us to deduce what a 'verb' is like, and such conditions don't exist. But semantic criteria are helpful in identifying prototypical verbs in a language. When we start analysing a language, after all, we have no idea what morphosyntactic criteria there are for us to identify word classes with. Words with similar functional, morphological and syntactic behaviour as these prototypical verbs would then be classified as 'verbs'. Givón (2001) gave this set of criteria for identifying prototype verbs: 

All literate Chinese people can read and write in Mandarin, even if they do not speak it. It is common in Hong Kong to be able to read and write in Mandarin but, when reading aloud, use Cantonese pronunciations. Mandarin is the only standard written form of Chinese, after all. The bulk of newspaper articles must be written in Mandarin, though there could be informal columns where local dialects are used. There are a handful in Hong Kong, and they could have those in Taiwan as well, though I doubt that's allowed in the Mainland.
