Did the CIA follow a documented set of criteria when determining targets for political assassination during the Cold War, especially in regards to foreign heads of state or government? There have been examples from history where the CIA assassinated foreign leaders, "on orders from the White House", but would they have always been blind orders, or was a defined, protocols-based evaluation process implemented first? 

This is a question I've never heard asked about the English Civil War (+1 for thoughtfulness and creativity!), but perhaps for the reason that it's not relevant to the conflict. The overwhelming present-day historical consensus holds that the tensions and causes of eventual warfare between Charles I, Parliament, and the realms over which they ruled were homegrown. In short, they had as much to do with Charles' personality and horrible crisis management abilities as the political and religious ideals of Parliament and the Roundheads. The form of "Republicanism" that emerged under Cromwell--and the constitutional monarchy formed after the Glorious Revolution--were sui generis to 17th century Britain, as were the Protestant faith traditions that underpinned them... No political incenctives for intervention As the OP and commenters have pointed out, the military conflicts that were sapping the Continent at the time meant that there was absolutely no incentive for foreign intervention from polities that--in times of peace--would have had an interest in stirring the English pot. (I'm referring to the Dutch, France, Spain, or Sweden.) Consider as well that just because England was a "Republican Commonwealth" under Cromwell does not mean that the Dutch or semi-democratic city-states of Italy considered it worthy of ideological support or even lip-service, in the way that America today might provide to other liberal democracies. A Protestant Civil War It's also important to note that from a religious standpoint, this was very much an intra-Protestant conflict. The factions had no sympathetic parallels on the Continent. Charles I subscribed to "High Anglicanism", which may have been Catholicism in form and function, but hardly in affiliation. Hence no Catholic countries would have been religiously motivated to support the Royalists. Conversely, the Presbyterian Scots and Puritan Roundheads adhered to largely grassroots, English sects of Protestantism. Sure, they shared some common doctrines with German/Swedish Lutheranism, the Dutch Anabaptists, or France's embattled Huguenot minority, but not in ways that would underpin meaningful political support or a productive, cross-Channel military alliance. A word on schools of interpretation There have been a lot of competing schools of interpretation concerning the English Civil War's ideological motivations over the years. Describing them here is outside the scope of the question, but I mention them since most have at one time or another claimed ideological sympathy with contemporary thinkers on the Continent. A good example is Thomas Hobbes' commentary that the war was a clash between those who ascribed to an emergent scientific worldview and the forces of traditionalist religion (see the "Behemoth" excerpt from Robert Kraynak's History and Modernity in the Thought of Thomas Hobbes). Hobbes openly expressed that his view was shared by other intellectuals both in England and abroad. However, let's take a step back and observe that the current "overwhelming historical consensus" on the conflict's causes that I allude to in the first paragraph is scarcely 20 years old. Any theories devised earlier have been more or less discarded, whether for imposing values upon the conflict's factions that are anachronistic (in the case of the Whig School), incompatible with 17th century English societal dynamics (see class-based and Marxist interpretations), or too personality-driven (i.e. Hobbes). Unfortunately for Hobbes, and the Whigs, Marxists, and Revisionists who came after him, most professional historians today hold to an interpretation that puts the Crown's difficult relations with the polities of Scotland, Ireland, and "Parliamentary" England front and center. 

The Liber Abaci is not about counting. Almost all of it are solutions to various algebra problems. The first chapter describes the Arabic numerals. The second shows how to multiply using Arabic numerals and it gets more complicated from there. So, it is not really a book about "counting". Throughout the middle ages and going back to Roman times the standard method of doing advanced arithmetic was the counting table: 

The catapult is in the back, the ballista are the items in the front with the arrows coming out of them. This is out in the field (notice trees in background). 

For the most part they borrowed the money. A lot of the money was borrowed from France and Holland who were both eager to make trouble for the British. For example, in June of 1787 John Adams borrowed 1 million guilders from Holland on behalf of the Congress. The congress also issued a lot of domestic debt, notably bonds they called "loan-office certificates." The army was largely disbanded after the British surrender in the Battle of Yorktown in 1781 and by 1784 was a small force. The major expense for the country was the interest on the debt. For example, in 1787 military expenses were $176,000 and interest on the debt was $871,000. Another source of income was sales of land from the western territories to pioneers. They also "requisitioned" money from the several states. For example, here is the list of assessments from 1787: 

This is kind of a vague question, but in general, kings were revered figures throughout history on average. Of course, it is popular now to criticize kings, accentuate their faults and scandals, and deprecate them as tyrants and monsters. But, in real actuality at the time kings were revered figures in their homelands for the most part. Many peasants believed that the king could cure illnesses just by touching a person and it was common for people to bow or kneel at the sight of the king. For example, King Louis XVIII, who was enthroned after the Restoration, was an unpresumptuous man and he often used to just go strolling around in the gardens of Paris when he got old, and people would bow down and curtsy out of respect for him. Even in periods of time when nobility was unpopular, in most cases the monarch was still held in awe and respect. For example, in Tudor England commoners were quite irritated by the "court" which were fantastically richer than the average person. So, they would sometimes throw mud or shit at them in the streets if they saw somebody in court dress. However, such treatment was usually reserved for random male courtiers. If the queen herself appeared on the street, everyone would bow. 

I believe that long-range artillery predates the Korean War. This makes me wonder, why did South Korea (and the international military forces) consider this an acceptable situation? Why would they leave the capital city exposed like that? (Was the military cost of gaining further territory too high?) 

My question is whether tobacco and marijuana were ever competing products in Europe. It occurred to me that marijuana is an Old World plant, whereas tobacco is a New World plant, and therefore had to be introduced after 1492—by which time I guess marijuana would already have been available in Europe. So it is curious that of two broadly similar products, tobacco was the one that caught on. (I've never tried marijuana, and I have never had a smoking habit, so I'm not sure whether the products are directly comparable, but the general idea of smoking a dried leaf seems similar.) 

I've just finished Dorin Kearns Goodwin's Team of Rivals. The presentation of the book suggested that the Southern states seceded as a response to Lincoln's election. I am confused by that timing: Lincoln seemed to have a very moderate anti-slavery position. He was staunchly opposed to the expansion of slavery to new states, but even years later did not believe that slavery could be interfered with in states where it was established (except as a war power; or unless there was a constititional amendment). 

I have now read two books from the 1800s in which single young men flirt with married pregnant women. (The first was Anna Karenina, in which Veslovsky flirts with Kitty Levin. The second was Middlemarch, in which Captain Lydgate flirts with Rosamond Lydgate.) The first time I encountered this, I just thought it was strange. When I saw it a second time, I started to wonder if there was a cultural value I was missing. (Without offering a personal reflection, I'll observe that the tone of this Wikipedia article suggests that attraction to pregnant women is a fringe thing in the present-day English-speaking world.) But historically, were pregnant women widely regarded as particularly attractive—to the point where it became a literary trope? 

I'm reading a book on Charles Lindbergh, thinking about his support for non-interventionism leading up to World War II. The America First Committee has a number of prominent names associated with it, so I was led to wonder what their motivations were. It's possible that these people were taking a principled stand against intervention in foreign conflicts (such as might be expressed these days about the conflicts in Syria, Iraq, Yemen, or Libya), or it might be that they were hoping that Nazi Germany would prevail in its wars. Clearly the answer could be different for different people. I don't know if the movement has been studied in any depth. (Reflections on whether a question such as this can be answered from historical evidence would also be welcome.) 

From this you can see there were arrayed against the migrating Hebrews a whole collection of enemies which already occupied Canaan and opposed them. 

Notice that there is an exemption for a person "passing through". So, for example, if a foreign diplomat had, say, a Burmese slave and was just traveling through the state, then that would be allowed. Note that the same laws forbade free negroes or mulattoes from settling in Virginia, as defined by being of one-fourth blood of a negro. Such people could be arrested at will and expelled from the state. 

In theory, the "credentials" were only important so far as to ensure the deputy had a legal right to be in the assembly. In practice, however, the "checking of credentials" was effectively an election, because the estates voted on them, kind of like the way the Senate votes on executive appointments in the United States. If the commoners and clergy were allowed to vote on noble credentials, they could basically kick out of the assembly any noble deputy they did not like. A secondary, non-political issue was the nobles undoubtedly resented the idea of presenting their credentials to commoners--an outrage and humiliation. 

To come full circle, let's talk about what happens next even though it has nothing to do with international trade. Now, the New Orleans broker, lets call him "David Chambliss" has a sight draft (a "check") drawn on the United Bank of New York. So, this document says: The United Bank of New York agrees to pay David Chambliss of New Orleans $5,000 on demand. Signed, S.Derby, Treasurer of the United Bank of New York. Chambliss has this document since the New York correspondent mailed it to him. Chambliss can use this draft to buy something in New York, but lets say he wants to have the money locally so he can buy more cotton. What he will do is take the draft to his bank in New Orleans and write on it: Pay to the Bank of New Orleans, [signed] David Chambliss When the Bank of New Orleans gets this, it will credit Chambliss $5,000 and he can then withdraw silver dollars from the bank to buy cotton. Meanwhile, one of two things will happen depending on whether the United Bank of New York is a correspondent bank of the Bank of New Orleans, meaning that it has an account there. If so, then the Bank of New Orleans will send the draft to the United Bank of New York which will credit the account of that bank with the $5,000. If not, then the Bank of New Orleans will send the draft to whichever bank is its New York correspondent, say its the Mercantile and Trade Bank of New York. In this case the New Orleans Bank will receive the credit from Mercantile and Trade, and Mercantile and Trade will settle up with United.
