We've had ultralow interest rates for a very long time now (I think unprecedented in history). Is it possible that this extremely loose monetary policy is creating bubbles? Bill Gross has put out a warning: $URL$ Is it possible he is right? What would be the impact on the economy? What will the FED do if this happens, do they have other policy-tools besides QE and lowering interest rates? thanks in advance 

It's the total credit market, not only US government bonds, but also debt of other countries, also corporate debt etc. See here: $URL$ and here: $URL$ Maybe this chart (not recent though) clarifies it a bit also: $URL$ 

Every central bank creates money, it's the reason why these institutions are created. The central bank is "the lender of last resort", which means that it is responsible for providing its economy with funds when commercial banks cannot cover a supply shortage. In other words, the central bank prevents the country's banking system from failing. However, the primary goal of central banks is to provide their countries' currencies with price stability by controlling inflation (There is however lots of discussion about this purpose and whether central banks are actually creating stability or disrupting it). see: $URL$ for more info. Not all central banks are creating money at the same pace though... The FED stopped it's QE-program, while the ECB for example is out in full force QE atm. Central banks used to be constrained because their printed notes were convertible to gold, so they could only print so much notes as there was gold in their vaults. However, these constraints were totally taken away when Nixon closed the gold window in 1971. Actually the United States defaulted on their obligations then, they already printed way much more notes than were covered by their gold reserves. If Nixon didn't close the gold window, the gold reserves of the US would have been totally drained... more information: $URL$ hope this helps, best regards 

Looked a bit further, I think I possibly found what you're looking for: The Overall Trade Restrictiveness Index (OTRI) summarizes the trade policy stance of a country by calculating the uniform tariff that will keep its overall imports at the current level when the country in fact has different tariffs for different goods. The data: $URL$ Background: $URL$ hope this helps, best regards 

I'll try to fit this in an answer. I think you are confusing nominal and relative value. Inflation means that the 'value' of your money depreciates relative to other things. For example, in the year 2000 I could buy a bread for 1 USD. In the year 2015 I can buy a bread for 2 USD. This means that the dollar lost half of it's value relative to bread. But nominal 1 USD is still 1 USD and 1 bread is still 1 bread. So in your example: today 1 BTC = 578.25 USD. If there is inflation of the USD (the value depreciates), then all else being equal BTC should appreciate against the USD (go up in nominal USD-value). So to work further with the bread-example. If in the year 2000 1 BTC would buy 500 USD then in 2015 1 BTC should buy 1000 USD. So the USD went down in value relative to BTC. for more information: $URL$ $URL$ 

Central banks can create money 'out of nothing'. So for starters there isn't 'less amount' of money left with the central bank. The amount of money at the central bank is 'infinite'. So it's not because the CB lends X amount of money to the government, that the CB has X amount less money to lend to the banks, the supply of money is not constrained... Off course, creating too much money and monetizing debt can have negative consequences for sure (for example hyperinflation in extreme cases), but that's another discussion.

I studied maths not economics so I won't comment on your graphs or theoretic models. In my experience as a rates trader, some economic models have their place but their inherent assumptions do not capture the practical market dynamics. I'll comment on the parts of your question I disagree with. Hopefully you appreciate a devil's advocate. Firstly, a "a sovereign debt ratings downgrade" by a ratings agency has little value in the world today as a binary event. Most financial practitioners have made up their mind about the credit quality of issuers through independent or public research before ratings agencies update their databases. Ironically, one possibility is that this may indeed be a classic "sell the rumour, buy the fact" scenario, whereby reasonably large speculators sell the bonds preemptively, profit from general declining markets before the ratings downgrade and then use the liquidity and market wide focus generated by the event to exit their positions, and in fact the bonds may actually increase in value slightly due to this. This is classic Jessie Livermore style of trading (Reminiscences of a Stock Operator). There will doubtless be managed funds whose rules preclude investing in junk status bonds so demand for the bonds overall will likely decline overall although I expect more over a period than specifically because of that binary event. The notion of "bonds" is a very broad term. If an issuer is downgraded the impact may be greater for various different maturities. The UK in the wake of the financial crisis was under considerable pressure due to its reliance on the financial sector and its government bonds underwent considerable re pricing, but the riskier, longer dated bonds suffered considerably worse that the much less riskier, shorted dated bonds, so in that scenario money market bill rates fell but longer bond rates rose. When I think about the currency wide issue of money, if you have a reasonably large amount of sovereign debt held by investors that is sold those investors then have only a set of options available to them with respect to that money: 

The first of these is just an asset reallocation and weakens sovereign bond prices relative to other assets in the economy. Your argument about government financing is true and the GDP output would be expected to decline, further as confidence also becomes a factor. The second would weaken the spot FX rate and the cross-currency basis swap levels. Indirectly this threatens to increase inflation since import prices will be affected by the currency movement. However, a weaker currency might tempt outside speculators at some equilibrium point. The third is difficult; no asset manager will deposit funds unprotected with a bank (particularly a domestic one) and the alternative of receiving back sovereign bond collateral is unappealing, so the repo rates will probably be increased in line with the rates on the bonds themselves, although this is another form of interest rate that does have significant impact and is not necessarily the same the bond rates. Indeed there will also be curvature to this as well. As an example in 2017 the German government bond curve had 0-1Y yields at -70bps, and a repo rate often at similar levels. But the 20y-30y bond yields were at +100bps whilst the repo rate might be at -100bps. This may sound like arbitrage is possible, but it actually isn't - there is no scenario you can gain without running risk, and those different risks were considered and deemed to be worth the values potentially attainable by those who dared. Finally I will point out to you the transmission mechanism. A central bank presides over its own currency and attempts to influence its economy by changing its deposit rate. However, a central bank is inherently connected to the government. I do not consider it wise to treat the two as separate entities. As a national bank, whose fortunes are intimately tied to the government, you would probably be better off buying and holding the sovereign debt if the short dated bonds offered considerably more interest than the central bank deposit rate, since from their point of view a government failure or a central bank failure might be one and the same. If you consider the holdings of Italian sovereign debt by Italian banks you will recognise this strategy as a kind of moral hazard. So the transmission mechanism is likely to remain in place for the short dated bonds and be ultimately tied to the deposit rate. I appreciate there is no general conclusion to this thread, and some ideas are not necessarily coherent or consistent. I just found it an interesting question and thought I would explore my own thoughts in raw form. Possibly you find them useful. 

To keep the published balance of payments balanced. The problem is: how do we measure these flows? In particular, we generally have no idea where non-electronic currency (e.g., $100 dollars bills) is being held. If illegal activities were disguised as something else ("money laundering"), the cash flows should end up in whatever accounts the activity was disguised to be. Countries tend to only include illegal transactions in the national accounts if the statisticians believe that they have a way of tracking them. For example, Statistics Canada was able to estimate the extent of tobacco smuggling (to avoid taxes) based on the disruption in other data. The underground economy behaves differently in each country, and so attempts to measure its effects varies across countries. To what extent illegal transactions are just a measure to evade currency controls (and not for trafficking in illegal goods) they would once again show up in the form that the transaction was registered. One typical way this is done is to adjust invoices in trade, so that the amount of money exchanged is greater than the true value of the goods. This shows up in the national accounts as an excessively large imports/exports (depending on the direction of the flow). 

I have electrical engineering training, and the focus on CPUs creates a technical issue. Before the early 1990s (when I did my degree), CPUs would have largely been only embedded in what are recognisably digital computers. Electronics would otherwise be implemented with simpler digital/analog circuits. Currently, the path of least resistance is to just use a CPU for practically everything. For example, cars have plenty of embedded CPUs, whereas back in the 1970s, many might have been almost entirely analog circuits (the radio being the only possible exception). So any measure of CPUs per unit of GDP should be exploding higher. This is just a reflection of electrical engineers’ design preferences. If we just try to confine ourselves to CPUs in digital computers, we could try to compute some normalised computing capacity. (This raises problems: do we include phones? Game consoles? Tablets?) The next problem is: so what? My computer CPUs have been getting faster over the decades, but at the same time, the bloated operating system chews up more of the resources. I end up doing roughly the same tasks in the same amount of time. Even without having any data, knowing what we know about computing power, my experiences are obviously be widely replicated. That is, real GDP is growing at around 2% per year in the developed countries, but installed CPU capacity has to be growing way faster than that, even if we take a narrow definition of “computer”. Realistically, you might need to identify some industries that might show a correlation between their growth and CPU usage. It’s hard to see how adding server farms can increase the production of restaurants and barber shops. 

I have the 2008 hardcover edition, and in that edition, Chapter 10 starts on page 249. I could not spot that quote - what is the section title? In any event, in the 2008 edition, there is a section “Prudence and Surveillance” within Chapter 10. In it, he describes “customer and collegiate surveillance.” The argument is that when banks were largely allowed to fail, the private sector had no choice but to monitor bank risk taking. 

It seems safe to say that the bulk of that wealth consists of equity (stock) holdings, not "money." (For example, Bill Gates owns a lot of share of Microsoft.) Let's assume that the top 85 people wanted to redistribute their wealth voluntarily. 

In other words, there would presumably be a transfer of wealth, but it would be a lot less than what is implied by current market prices. This of course raises the obvious question of why they would do this voluntarily; the top 85 richest people did not get that way by dumping their wealth on random strangers.
