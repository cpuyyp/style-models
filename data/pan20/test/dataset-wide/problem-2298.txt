First the trash, gets transferred to either the onsite trash collection point or into my haul out container. Second, Charcoal gets set aside to use as foundation for starting my fire. Lastly the ash, I find that a layer of ash in the bottom of the pit makes starting a fire easier. I never remove all the ash, I try to leave about a half inch (1.5cm). As you are at an established campground in a National or State forest with a fires ring, I expect there will be one of two things present. 

Water tight is subject to lots of variable. As you mention just staying out of the water is the least risk. There are Waterproof Transparent Dressings, a good example is Nexcare™ Tegaderm™ Waterproof Transparent Dressing It lists among its attributes "Seals out water, dirt and germs to help prevent infection" I have seen this stuff in use, it can stay in place for up to a week, and is not easy to remove. If there are hairs growing in the area, it may compromise the seal and make removal painful. 

Get a rail schedule, and do research to determine if it is reliable. Get a tunnel map, there are likely safety areas where a person can get out of the trains path. Learn the speed the train will be travelling when it goes through the tunnel 

I agree with what Charlie Brumbaugh said and will not repeat it, but will offer an perspective on what the individual can do. The single most effective thing you can do to improve your acclimatization rate is to get in good aerobic shape before starting your trip. Ability to acclimatize varies enormously among individuals, and, for an individual, ability to acclimatize can depend on the altitude. Some people are fine at modest elevations (say, 14,000 feet and lower) and then just top out. Ability to acclimatize will eventually lessen with age, but at what age the decline becomes noticeable will again vary enormously with the individual. And, again, staying aerobically fit will postpone that decline. Moreover, if you take several yearly trips, you may find your ease of acclimatization actually increases with the years (for awhile.) As for weather, naturally you will be able to move more briskly if it is not too hot, but this would be true at sea level. As long as you are pushing yourself but not exhausting yourself -- and staying hydrated -- you will acclimatize. Statistics won't tell you anything about yourself at altitude or anywhere else. 

Number 2 is the one pertinent to your question. Earlier, in a comment (since removed) I recommended using bear canisters for your food. I was persuaded by @Charlie Brumbaugh that bear canisters as a cougar preventative are overkill: bears are attracted by food lying around, cougars are not. Cougars are, however, attracted by the small critters (raccoons, mice) that will be attracted by food you leave improperly stored. The linked source above advises householders in cougar country: 

For me, the cons kill quilts - I like zipping into my mummy bag and not having to worry about lying perfectly still :) I think in summer trips, they are a pretty awesome idea... I always end up half out of my mummy bag anyways, no matter how light it is, so why not? 

I don't think you need to bypass them at all. You didn't say what time of year you'd be going, but in the later summer/fall, they are not nearly that deep. Also, at any time of year you could easily carry your pack(s) across, then go back and piggy-back your son with a 2nd trip. The first trip would also give you a feel for how rough the crossing would be. In June 2015 I did the 100 Mile Wilderness (along with the whole AT south bound). Even at that time, with the rivers running hard and sometimes waist deep, it would be quite reasonable to cross in the manner I described. 

If the GPS is mostly off (i.e. you're only rarely using your GPS app), I think you will get ~2 days of battery life. To get that much battery life, you'd need to do these things: 

The article said that the Park Service had not given up and was fighting the case, but I have not found anything more recent on the subject. What is happening? What is an informed prognosis on the outcome of the legal battle? The Majestic sounds like a Las Vegas hotel, but I better stop before I rant. 

Most of my camping has been above timberline and ticks have never been a problem. However, a day in the garden at home in northern Virginia often results in a deer tick or two, despite long pants and long sleeves and DEET. There's been a suggestion of a short camping trip close to home, but it is a banner year for deer ticks here, and the mere thought of sleeping on the ground here makes me feel itchy. Am I overreacting? Is there a way to enjoy a couple of nights outdoors without becoming a host to hordes of these tiny thirsty critters? A complication is that I prefer not to sleep in a tent if the weather is good. Is a tent necessary to avoid deer ticks? 

See this article on plogging, from the Washington Post Swedish Fitness Craze Coming to the US (March 06, 2018): 

According to a google search sulfur is widely available in nature. Volcanic regions and hot springs are common sources of it in elemental state. Less obvious sources are iron pyrites (iron sulfide), galena (lead sulfide), gypsum (calcium sulfate), Epsom salts (magnesium sulfate) and many other minerals. It has a low boiling point so can be distilled without much difficulty. Source It creates poisonous fumes when burnt and is one of the three main components of black powder, making it an important element for the survivalist. If I am in an unfamiliar area, how can I identify natural sources of sulfur? 

I have slept many nights in a homemade conversion van From experience getting up at dawn, it usually feels warmer outside the van then in it. There are probably scientific words for it; but the metal gets cold and "sucks" the heat away from your body. If you have a tent, AND IF IT IS SAFE to set it up where you are, and if you have a good insulator between you and the ground. I would pick the tent if warmth was the only concern. Additionally it will be easier to get comfortably stretched out in the tent. 

I just looked at our sleeping bags, which we bought in 1972. They are in pretty good condition, with only a few small patches. Is it unusual for a down sleeping bag to give service for 45 years and still be in good condition? Or is this par for the course? I estimate that the sleeping bags have been used for a minimum of 1,500 nights. Between trips, they have always been stored unstuffed on a large shelf with nothing on them or pressing against them. We dry-clean them probably every second or third year -- I'm not sure. Also pertinent: we sleep in them lightly but fully clothed. They are the only pieces of our original backpacking equipment that we have not replaced several times. 

So far, clear. But take a look at the name for the young of cougars. The young of mountain lions are often called kittens. This seems an odd choice for the young of such a large cat. Wikipedia says: 

The principal risk is that you will slip and fall. Depending on the force of the water and what is downstream, this could be serious. Look at the tread on your hiking boot or running shoe or even tennis shoe, and then look at the sole of your foot. Unless you can pick out a sandy route with no rocks to cross the stream, it is pretty obvious that there will be more friction between the streambed and the shoe than between the streambed and your bare foot, i.e., you will be less likely to slip and fall. The better grip of your shoes also allows you to cross the stream faster. A secondary benefit of crossing with your shoes on is that very cold mountain streams will feel much less cold if your feet are insulated by boots and socks. Yes, your shoes will get wet. But you can pour the water out and pat much of the moisture out with a towel or sweatshirt. You can also change to dry socks. If you have more streams to cross than you have pairs of dry socks, wear a thin undersock of some very low friction material to protect your feet against chafing. 

One other fixed cost, transportation to/from the trail: For me, that means 2 one-way flights at ~$400/each. 

If you are into ultralight/lightweight backpacking, nothing tops BackpackingLight. They do a lot of scientific testing, and the articles are very thorough. It is a pay site, but it's something like $20 USD per year. You can see a list of some of their best articles here. They regularly come up with objective test measures for backpacking gear, and then carry out those tests on a wide array of items. i.e. for testing inflatable air mattresses, they figured out a way to measure how slippery the bottoms of each mat was, along with independently measuring weight, R-Value, etc. Finally the (free) forums on that site are also a great place to find more specific info about particular gear. As backup for that, I like what BackpackGearTest does. 

I've been surprised by how durable tent floors are. I've never used footprints, and I have a silnylon-floored tent (i.e. not very durable material) that has lasted hundreds of nights and still doesn't have any holes or thin spots. So really, I would call it wasted money and weight in your pack to carry a footprint. If you forsee using the tent in "fast pack" configuration, i.e. no tent body, then consider getting the footprint just for that. 

I have not actually had a sailing canoe in the water, but I have looked at a bunch of pictures and videos. Almost every leeboard you see on a canoe is hinged so it will raise up when there is an obstruction. When the canoe gets up any speed then the water becomes an obstruction, this video is for an add on sail kit maker for canoes. Notice that when the canoe gets any kind of speed the leeboard tilts up and is barely below the hull of the craft. Canoes being relatively narrow tend to get tilty/tippy when any side force is present. As seen in the captured image of the example video the outrigger is just barely touching the water and the leeboard is within a few degrees of being horizontal. At this point neither is really adding any value. 

A fish stringer goes through the gill and mouth of a live fish, providing a way to keep them captive and alive in the lake or river they are caught from. 

Not discounting the existing answers which provide great perspectives. You don't really care where the North Pole is. It is not like there is only one or two, nor is like anything is stable. There are half a dozen north poles and most of them move around regularly and they move a lot (10s and 100s even 1,000s of miles/kilometers). 

I have eagerly consumed many accounts of early mountaineering expeditions in which the mountaineers always eagerly consumed Kendal Mint Cake (KMC). I got the impression that they would have found it unthinkable to set off without it. Note that it is difficult to digest anything at very high altitudes, because digestion involves oxidation. Sugar, a simple carb, is the easiest thing to digest, and that is about all KMC is. Wikipedia, Kendal Mint Cake says: 

A pace counter is a low-tech, manually operated, very light-weight device that you can make yourself from heavy cord and beads, or buy for $5 to $10. In contrast to a pedometer, which counts for you, you have to mentally keep count of the paces you take; there is nothing automatic about it. This article tells you how to make your own. The article calls the device Ranger Beads and says they were originally developed by the military. Wikipedia tells you how to use the device. 

The article describes how to return the baby to its family or introduce it to potential adopter crows. 

I'd welcome more expert opinion on the sensitivity of nesting females to light. The adult turtles I have encountered seem phlegmatic, but maybe inside they are nervous. Also, I am perhaps reading too much into the behavior of the Aldabra Atoll turtle. Aldabra Atoll has only a small research station and very few visitors -- it is as unlike a Florida seaside community as any place on Earth. 

I searched for any scientific evidence that lead from bullets harm trees. I could not find any harm from the lead (other then the obvious physical trauma). You probably would not want to eat the tree, but there is no evidence that lead in moderate or even heavy amounts will cause to the tree to die, or live a substandard life. Trees can survive for long periods with a few bullets in them. 

No, it is not a good solution for foot wear. While it will bond, it forms a waterproof bond that you can "Sand, Paint or Stain". It is great for many thing you might sand, but not for things that flex. 

As Chris says in his answer "widest part of a van is about a third of the way up". Everything in his answer is correct. I have slept many nights in a homemade conversion van. If you are sleeping alone, then sleeping diagonally gives much more length. Useing Chris's width of 5'8' (68 inches) a width of 48 inches, and a Triangle calculator we find that the diagonal length is 83 inches (almost 7 feet) Another consideration is heat or rather lack of heat. Metal vehicles like vans, shed heat quickly. You go to sleep stretched out diagonally on a warm evening and you wake up curled up trying conserve body heat. From experience getting up at dawn, it usually feels warmer outside the van then in it.
