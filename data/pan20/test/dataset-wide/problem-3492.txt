Yes. The central bank (say the Fed in U.S.) can purchase bonds, but notice: 1) The Fed is not going purchase t-bonds and t-bills directly from the Treasury. It will only purchase or sell bonds in the market. ("open market purchase" or "open market sell") 2) Open market purchase is not only the buying of bonds, but also the creation of money (You sell bonds to the Fed, and the Fed will pay you). Increase in money supply means inflation. Obviously, the Fed can't buy too much bonds, or the U.S. will have to deal with disastrous hyperinflation. 3) Most central banks have some degree of independence in determining what to do. The Fed won't purchase more than they want, and the government is not able to force them. 

The budget constraint is $c_t + \tau_t + s_{t+1} =w_t(1-l_t) +(1+r_t)s_t$ And assume $\underset{t \longrightarrow \infty}{lim} \ \displaystyle{\frac{s_t}{\Pi_{i=1}^{t-1} (1+r_i)}} = 0$ Lag Operator $L$ is defined as $L \cdot x_{t+1} = x_t$ How can I get lifetime budget constraint using the Lag Operator? Many Thanks! 

The rate of technological progress is Endogenously determined. For example in Two-Sector Growth Model (Rebelo), we have production $Y = C + I_K = A \ (vK)^\alpha \ (uH)^{1-\alpha}$ and education $I_H = B \ ((1-v)K)^\alpha \ ((1-u)H)^{1-\alpha}$ Now $v$ and $u$ are endogenously determined, and thus $H$ is endogenously determined. $A$ doesn't change, but $Y$ will increase over time due to increase in $H$. Another example will be the Learning-by-Doing Model. Recall in Exogenous Models $A_t$ is exogenously given by $A_t = (1+g)^t A_0$ But now we want $A_t$ to be determined endogenously. Thus we assume technological progress is due to knowledge creation, and knowledge is a side-production of investment. And thus we let $A_t \equiv \sum_{i=0}^N K_{it}$ (there are N identical firms) 

In the expected utility theory we usually consider these two situations as equivalent since the probability distribution over the final outcomes (the color of the ball) is the same: there is a 50% chance that a blue ball is selected, and a 50% chance that a red ball is selected. Therefore from a theoretical perspective it is hard to think of any reason why people would strictly prefer one situation to another. However, empirically a substantial fraction of people exhibits a strict preference for the situation A rather than the situation B, for instance in this paper. According to my experience, most researchers are inclined to see this behavior as a mistake that reflects some difficulties with the computations of probabilities. Interestingly, this behavior is associated with ambiguity aversion, which is also sometimes considered as an anomaly. However, this is largely a matter of interpretation and other researchers prefer not to make any normative judgment on this behavior, as a matter of principle, and prefer instead to try to find rational explanations for it. It is for instance sometimes argued that the additional layer of uncertainty which is added in situation B would be a legitimate reason for risk-averse individuals to strictly prefer situation A. 

I found one survey which corresponds to what I was looking for: Theories of Statistical Discrimination and Affirmative Action: A Survey by Hamming Fang and Andrea Moro, in the Handbook of Social Economics (2011 edition). 

Maybe you can do a Probit regression? Let Y be a binary indicator. If the customer continues to use the website frequently (you can determine the threshold for that) after leaving the comment, then Y = 1, otherwise Y = 0. This Y is going to be your dependent variable. Let X be the measure of satisfactory, the higher the better. Your independent variables are X and some other factors that may be relevant. For example, the amount of time spent on this website prior to the survey, the amount of money spent on this website prior to the survey, number of friends and etc. If the coefficient for X is positive, it means customers tend to stay if they are satisfied with the website's customer support (i.e. customer support inefficiency lead to loss of customer). 

If the tax is not a lump-sum tax, then an increase in the size of tax means your deadweight loss triangle becomes larger. Green: Consumer Surplus Blue: Producer Surplus Red: Deadweight Loss 

The rate technological progress $g$ is Exogenously given. In both Solow and RCK, we can find $A_t = (1 + g)^t A_0 \ \ $(or $A(t) = A(0) e^{gt}$ if in continuous time). $Y$ increases over time because $A$ increases over time. This assumption of growth rate is very strong. 

In part a, if $B = D_1 + D_2$, then the SGPE should be $\left\lbrace D_1 = \frac{W}{3},\ D_2 = \frac{W}{3}, \left\lbrace P = \alpha (D_1 + D_2), \ S = (1 - \alpha) (D_1 + D_2) \right\rbrace \right\rbrace$ Don't say $P = \alpha \frac{2W}{3}$. That's an action, and the second stage best respond should a strategy (function) to make the equilibrium subgame perfect.
