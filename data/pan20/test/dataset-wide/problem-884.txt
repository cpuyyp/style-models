Actually, the stars and nebulae that make up the spiral arm are only temporarily part of that spiral arm. Spiral arms are more like sound waves where individual particles move around a more or less stationary position. (Look for instance at the animation of longitudinal waves from Dan Russel, the red dots move a bit to the left and to the right around a stationary position). Dust, gas and stars move towards or away from another just as longitudinal waves. Where the dust, gas and stars come close together (and where, therefore, the density increases), spiral arms can be seen as more stars are close together increasing the brightness at that position in the galaxy. This effect is, furthermore, much increased because the increased density of dust and gas in the spiral arm causes protostars to form. The brightest stars burn up their energy so fast that they will cease to exist even before the longitudinal wave (the spiral arm) has passed. These very bright stars only exist for a small portion of their orbital period around the galaxy's centre, and only while they are in the spiral arm. The large majority of stars exist much longer, but are also much dimmer and contribute only little to the overal brightness of the galaxy. This causes the spiral arms to be so much brighter than the rest of the disk, where also a lot of stars exist. But these can hardly be seen as they are much dimmer. Of course, the stars do not revolve around a stable position in the galaxy (as the red dots in the wave animation) but follow their own orbits around the centre of the galaxy. Sometimes a bit faster, and sometimes a bit slower depending on the position relative to the spiral arms. Because the spiral arms are waves, it does not matter that stars near the centre move faster than the stars at the edge. It just means that they will be part of the spiral arm for a shorter period of time. 

Potentially photons emitted by your torch could travel to infinite distances, assuming the universe will keep on expanding. If the light gets further away, the photons of your torch will be spread out over an increasing area and the density (number of photons per square metre) will decrease rapidly. At some distance, only one photon will strike the area of your eye/detector. And you may not be able to observe a single photon. It is also likely (but not certain) that the photons will be absorbed by atoms. 

No, there is no spherical volume of space within which objects all tend to approach us and thereby show blue-shift. The fact that the Andromeda galaxy is blue-shifted is because at these relatively small distances the cosmological red-shift is much smaller than further away. Andromeda's own (non-cosmological speed) is larger then the cosmological speed away from us and it happens to move towards us and is therefore blue-shifted. It could also have been moving away from us, and be red-shifted as a result, but that red-shift would not be cosmological. I'd expect that the chance that a nearby (Local Group) galaxy is either moving away from us or moving towards us is 50%. Furthermore, the Andromeda galaxy, and all other galaxies belonging to the Local Group, are gravitationally bound and would therefore not show any cosmological red-shift anyhow. NB. The Andromeda Galaxy is actually 2.5 million light years away from us. 

If you really want to use the method outlined in Wikipedia than you might use the Hipparcos catalogue to determine the mean absolute magnitude for each spectral type. I tried this and I got the following values for A and B type main sequence stars: 

The apparent visual is(V) magnitude $-0.05$. The colour index is $B-V = 1.239$, which means that it is probably a red K type star with temperature $T\approx 4000 \textrm{K}$ (from figure 2 on this webpage). The spectral type is K2IIIp, i.e. the spectral class is K2 and the luminosity class is III, a normal giant star. An indication for the Radius can be found from the Hertzsprung-Russel Diagram in which radii are added (see Figure here). The luminosity of Arcturus can be calculated as follows: $$ d = \frac{1}{\varpi}$$ where $d$ is in parsec and $\varpi$ is the parallax in arsceconds. The parallax is in columns 80-86 and is $\varpi = 88.85mas = 0.08885^{\prime\prime}$ for Arcturus. The distance is, therefore, $d=11.25\textrm{pc}$. You can then calculate the absolute magnitude ($M_V$): $$ M_V = m_V -5(\log{d}-1)$$ where $m_V$ is the apparent visual (V) magnitude. The absolute magnitude of Arcturus is: $M_V=-0.05 - 5(\log{11.25}-1)=-0.31$. The luminosity is then given by: $$M-M_{\textrm{sun}} = -2.5\log{\left( \frac{L}{L_{\textrm{sun}}}\right)}$$ where the absolute magnitude of the Sun is $M_{\textrm{sun}} = 4.83$ and $L$ is the luminosity of Arcturus. This gives: $$\log{\left( \frac{L}{L_{\textrm{sun}}}\right)} = 2.056 $$ $$L = 114 \textrm{L}_{\textrm{sun}}$$ From the Hertzsprung-Russel diagram we get a radius for Arcturus of about $R \approx 10 \textrm{R}_{\textrm{sun}}$. 

Yes there is a difference, Kuiper Belt Objects (KBOs) are a subset of Trans Neptunian Objects (TNOs). Other subsets are Oort-cloud objects (OCOs) and scattered disk objects (SDOs). These are not KBOs but they are TNOs. See for instance this wikipedia page. 

Depends on the interpretation of your question... The best places not to observe the moon are the north and south pole. On the north pole you will only be able to see objects above the celestial equator. As the moon orbits the Earth in one month its orbit is inclined from the celestial equator. This inclination is almost the same as the inclination of the ecliptic (path of the Sun) with the celestial equator. The ecliptic crosses the equator at two opposite points on the celestial sphere. This means that for about half its orbit, the Sun, and as the moon's orbit is near the ecliptic, also the Moon, will be above the ecliptic and therefore visible from the north pole. That being said, the Moon does not follow the ecliptic precisely as the moon's orbit is inclined from the ecliptic by about 5°. The inclination of the ecliptic is 23°, so during very special circumstances the maximum altitude of the Moon above the horizon on the North pole will be 18° during one month. The duration that the Moon will be above the horizon on the north pole will be about 10 days (a guess) about 13.6 days (edit:see comments below). So if we interpret your question as: Is there a place where the Moon will be below the horizon for a long period of time (> 1 month), then the answer is NO. But if this happens near June, then the Sun will also be above the horizon at the north pole (for six months), and as the Moon will be close to the Sun (as it follows more or less the ecliptic), it will be very hard to see the Moon during that time. So if you specifically ask whether the Moon will not be visible for an extended period of time, then the answer is YES. And there are of course also places with perpetual cloud cover ;-) 

Yes. If you have the Hipparcos data from ftp ($URL$ you will have several data files. In you have a field at position 347 that indicates whether the star is a double or multiple star:
