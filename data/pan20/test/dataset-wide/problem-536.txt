Use a chain wear gauge to see if the chain needs replacement (e.g. Park Tool CC-3.2).Generally, these err on the side of replacing a bit early, but if you want to be pedantic about it, you can use the Sheldon Brown link below to measure with a ruler. As for the sprockets or chainrings, I'll defer to this page by Sheldon Brown. The upshot is that worn teeth look like ramps and a non-stretched wont sit properly in the sprockets as shown in the image below (from Sheldon Brown) 

It happens, especially if you remove the pump head not perfectly vertically or you move the pump head while pumping. You can avoid this by using a bit of hose on the mini pump like on this mini pump 

In picking your cassette, I'm assuming that (a) it is the right number of speeds for your shifter and (b) your derailleur has enough capacity to use lowest gear. If this is the same sized cassette as you had before, this should be satisfied. The PG-1070 is a 10 speed cassette, so you just need a SRAM 10 speed chain (PC 1031, PC 1051, PC 1071, PC 1091, PC 1091R) [KMC also makes some SRAM compatible 10 speed chains if you choose to go that route, but the SRAM chains are reasonably priced and might work a bit more smoothly, so I don't see a point in going non-SRAM.] The differences in chains are highlighted on their product pages, usually some of the metals used on some of the plates or a bit of weight. They may also shape the plates slightly differently to aide shifting performance. SRAM recommends the PC 1091 or PC 1091R for Red group use, but you can use the others as well. Generally the differences are minor if existing other than a bit of weight in the cassettes and chains, but manufacturers suppose that people who buy expensive parts in the beginning will replace them with just as expensive parts further down the line (see the "looks cool" point above). 

700c and 29" and ISO 622 wheels are the same rim size (typically ones marketed as 29" are wider than ones marketed as 700c, so you can run fatter tires), so if you can go with that, thats what I'd do. Most front wheels are 100 mm hubs, so the wheel will go in. With rim brakes, the brakes won't align (and you'll have to remove them, since you don't care about brakes), but with disc brakes they should work with some adjustment. The geometry of the bike will change (the front end will become lower) and handling will be affected, but its been done before many times. These bikes are often called 69'ers or 96'ers (normally with the smaller wheel in the back; Trek used to sell bikes this way). and were designed to combine the rolling advantages of a 29er some better acceleration. That being said, I'd strongly advise against doing this if you don't have disc brakes since you really should have 2 independent braking systems, or use an adapter for brake posts to move them (Mavic used to make them for 700c->26", but you could fabricate your own). 

I-spec is a Shimano-proprietary mounting system for Shimano parts. Its supposed to make mounting and adjusting brake+shift levers faster and easier by putting them on one mounting clamp. I couldn't find a blurb on what it does / how it operates on the Shimano website, but the equivalent for SRAM is SRAM Matchmaker, which from their website: "The MatchMaker X clamp is more than just a clamp. It’s like having Martha Stewart tidy up your cockpit. Since each clamp accepts up to three controls, you can put everything from your XLoc suspension lockout, your SRAM shifters and AVID brake levers as well as your Reverb XLoc remote, all on two clamps. Short of genetically engineering longer thumbs, it’s the ideal way to put everything within easy reach. Just like Martha would." If you're running a mix of SRAM MatchMaker and Shimano I-Spec components, you can use a Problem Solvers MisMatch adapter to mix them up. 

You'd have to test it out - theres enough variation in tires (esp. studded tires) for two tires to be marked the same size and one fit and one not fit. This thread indicates that for an older Bad Boy with rigid fork was able to clear a 47 mm tire (which looks to be the largest possible), so I'd guess the answer is yes, but YMMV. 

Road front hubs are 100 mm and 8-10 speed rear hubs are 130 mm. In the case of the Trek 1.1, it's always been spec'd with a 8 speed rear hub, so those wheels should fit on the bike. 

You can remove them, but you may have to make small adjustments elsewhere (bar angle, seat, etc.). I wouldn't bother with getting refitted to the bike since the perturbations required are not very large, and you'll likely guess good ones naturally. Start by removing a spacer, riding a while, seeing how you like it, then go by feel on what (if anything) you want to adjust. 

The brakes will work fine. If you do replace the crankset, you'll likely need to replace the bottom bracket as well. The crankset should work, but it might not be optimal -- on SRAM, the chainrings have been spaced slightly wider apart on 11 speed and the chainrings are likely a bit thinner than 9 speed, which may be the case with Shimano as well. 

For those who subscribe to the rules: "Rule 19: Introduce Yourself If you deem it appropriate to join a group of riders who are not part of an open group ride and who are not your mates, it is customary and courteous to announce your presence. Introduce yourself and ask if you may join the group. If you have been passed by a group, wait for an invitation, introduce yourself, or let them go. The silent joiner is viewed as ill-mannered and Anti-V. Conversely, the joiner who can’t shut their cakehole is no better and should be dropped from the group at first opportunity." and "Rule 67: Do your time in the wind Nobody likes a wheel sucker. You might think you’re playing a smart tactical game by letting everyone else do the work while you sit on, but races (even Town Sign Sprints) are won through cooperation and spending time on the rivet, flogging yourself and taking risks. Riding wheels and jumping past at the end is one thing and one thing only: poor sportsmanship." 

Examples of the types of bikes discussed: - Hybrid: Trek 7.2fx, Specialized Sirrus (no suspension). Trek 8.3ds , Specialized Crosstrail (light suspension, useful if you have back problems). - Old mountain bike: 80s Specialized Hardrock or similar (these are very cheap, and work great on the road with some slicks). - Road bike: Trek Crossrip, Specialized Tricross (commuter cyclocross). Trek 520, Surly Long Haul Trucker, Novara Randonee (Touring). Charge Plug, Kona Dew Drop (commuter). 1'.You'll ride a bike thats comfortable a lot more than one that isn't, so go for a bike fit at the bike shop. You may need a wider saddle than what comes with most bikes if you weigh 240 pounds and due to possibly other factors you may need some different riding positions. 

Normally the solution is to wiggle the link a bunch and it loosens up. After installing the rivet, try flexing the chain in the direction of the rivet back and forth. If that doesn't work, use the other setting of your chain tool in order to loosen the link up (see the chain tool manual for details). 

The first thing to note is "Does the 8 speed hub clear the dropouts ?" You may be able to spread the frame if steel. Since you're likely going from a 120mm to 130 mm (which is 2 sizes - 120->126->130), you should be cold setting it. The second question would be "Can the brakes reach the rim?" Unfortunately, to my knowledge, nobody makes a 5 speed cassette. You'll have to get a 7 or 8 speed cassette and tweak the limit screws on the rear derailleur so you shift in the appropriate range (if indexed, and the sprocket spacing matches the indexing [ I don't think it will, since a 5 speed freewheel should have 5.5 mm, while a 7 or 8 speed cassette 5 mm] ). Alternatively, if you have friction shifters (or can deal with friction shifters), set the limit screws, throw on an 8 speed chain and friction shift. However, Velo Orange makes a cheap wheelset which can take a freewheel, and plenty of 5 speed freewheels are still around (e.g. IRD). (Note that you can get 126mm, 130 mm). My recommendation would be to cold set the frame to a 130 mm hub if you can and use your shifters in friction mode after adjusting the limit screws appropriately with a 7 or 8 speed cassette. If you don't want to cold set the frame, then buy a wheel with a freewheel hub of appropriate spacing (likely 120 mm if it came with a 5 speed freewheel - 120 mm hubs are still made, but I don't know who sells complete wheels so it may need to be built to order), buy a nice 5 speed freewheel from IRD and move on with your life. This will allow you to use indexing if you have it. The latter would be your only option if your frame is not steel. 

You can use either the Sora or 105 shifters (all the cable pulls will match). Sora 9 speed has the proper ergonomics (instead of the silly button that it used to use on 8 speed), so its a good shifter. As for if you will notice any performance difference, both should shift fine (if the 105's are indeed in good condition) [if you're racing, maybe you'll notice a difference], but the ergonomics may be very slightly different between the tiagra-105-sora levers (but you'll get used to it) [it wouldn't surprise me if the current Sora levers are a slight modification of the 9 speed Tiagra levers due to trickle-down]. I'd probably suck it up and buy the Sora levers personally - brifters are too finicky/fragile in crashes for me to be comfortable buying used ones off eBay unless the price is very good. My guess is the bike shop guy wants you to go 10 speed which will involve replacing a whole bunch of stuff, hence the upturned nose. Or general cyclist snobbery. 

Often, this is a problem with derailleur adjustment, so I'd double check and triple check that first. The first thing to do is check if the rear derailleur is bent. If it is, get it un-bent - it is near impossible to adjust a rear derailleur which is bent adequately. The second thing to make sure you have adequate cable tension, proper cable installation and your derailleur is adjusted properly. Here are some good directions on doing that (as well as here). Assuming your cables are installed properly and you've adjusted your derailleur correctly (and as correctly as possible) and your chain+cassette aren't worn, then I'd start by replacing the rear derailleur (you may have developed a lot of play in it, and it is significantly cheaper than a shifter) and then look into replacing the shifters. IIRC, the Shimano 105 shifters from about 10 years ago were shoddily built, so it may be the shifters after all.
