because it is normal for participants in a succession dispute to ask for foreign help, thus often getting foreign warriors involved in a civil war. Thus Byzantine civil wars in earlier times had often resulted in Turkish, Serbian, Bulgarian, Venetian, or Genoese military and naval involvement. It is also common to ask for foreign arbitration. Usually a more powerful foreign realm is asked to arbitrate. Ottoman Sultan Murad II was much more powerful than what little as left of the Byzantine empire. The capital of the Ottoman Empire was then Edirne/Adrianople, which was much closer to Constantinople than any other foreign capital making communication quicker. Thus Ottoman Sultan Murad II was a fairly logical choice to ask to arbitrate. 

Reign of Maria Theresa as Archduchess of Austria, Queen of Hungary and Croatia, etc., Queen of Bohemia, Duchess of Styria, Carinthia and Carnioila, etc. 1740 to 1780. Reign of Maria Theresa as Empress consort of Holy Roman Empire 1745-1765. Reign of Joseph II as sole Archduke of Austria, King of Hungary and Croatia, etc., King of Bohemia, Duke of Styria, Carinthia and Carnioila, etc. 1780-1790. Reign of Joseph II as Elected Emperor of the Romans 1765-1790. Reign of Peter the Great of Russia 1673-1725. Reign of Empress regent Elizabeth of Russia 1741-1762. Reign of Empress regent Catherine II of Russia 1762-1796. Reign of King Charles III of Spain & the Indias 1759-1788. Reign of George III 1760-1820. Reign of King Frederick II the Great of Prussia 1740-1786. Reign of the Kangxi Emperor of Qing Dynasty Empire 1661-1722. Reign of the Qianlong Emperor of Qing Dynasty Empire 1735-1796/99.

Since none of the Mughal Padishahs after Auragenzeb (died 1707) can be considered a really great Mughal I think that is pretty much the entire list of contemporary or near contemporary monarchs who might be compared to Maria Theresa, though specialists might possibly think of a few others. Thus if you want to do a comparative ranking of Maria Theresa with contemporary monarchs these are her main competition. 

I live in Pennsylvania in the USA and most old houses I have seen have exterior window shutters. The advantage of exterior shutters is that while shut they protect the windows from shattering. The disadvantage of exterior shutters is that you have to go outside to shut the ones on the lower floor and open the upper story windows and reach out - possibly falling to your death - to shut their shutters. The advantage of interior shutters is that you can shut them easily while safely and comfortably inside - if you don't have stuff in the way. The disadvantage of interior shutters is that they don't protect the windows from being shattered. The best form of shutters would be exterior shutters you can shut from inside by turning a crank or pressing a button. So where are interior shutters common? I believe some were mentioned in a Sherlock Holmes story. 03-27-2017. In the Sherlock Holmes story "The Speckled Band" Holmes and Watson examine the Window's at Stoke Morton from the outside and then Holmes tells Miss Stoner: 

Tom Au's statements that the war had been fought against the South and that the South received none of the benefits from the Union victory are somewhat misleading over simplifications. At least during his answer, he assumed that everyone in the South had the same interests and stood to benefit equally from Southern victory. That is not the case. Four million people who lived in the South found themselves much richer after the Union victory than they had been before or they would have been after Confederate victory. They now owned themselves. Former Rebel soldiers mostly felt humiliated about being defeated. But they could have - and maybe some actually did - consoled themselves by thinking that their humiliating defeat was actually a blessing for their sons, grandsons, great grandsons and remoter descendants. Their defeat meant that their descendants would never have to suffer, as they had suffered, in hypothetical future wars between the USA and the CSA. The Union victory ensured that no poison gas nor atomic bombs would ever be dropped on Southern cities during future wars between the CSA and the USA. That was one very important benefit resulting from Union victory that everyone in the South shared in. And there were other groups in the South that benefited in various ways from Southern defeat, who were better off losing than winning the Civil War. Thus it is an oversimplification to say that the South gained no benefit from the Union victory. 

This Wikipedia article lists the relatives of Count Theodosius: $URL$ Magnus Maximus is not among them. According to Wikipedia article on Magnus Maximus his full name was Flavius Magnus Maximus Augustus. That seems a rather odd name for someone whose father was named Flavius Iulius Eucherius. Byt in late Roman times it was common for two brothers to have completely different names, each selecting a few names from the many their ancestors had. It does make him son of Flavius Eucherius and the daughter of a Carausius. I have the suspicion that some of the relatives attributed to Magnus Maximus were not his real relatives. The website DIR says little about the possible relationships of Magnus Maximus.$URL$ the family tree of the dynasties of Valentinian and Theodosius does not show Magnus Maximus. $URL$ So I am somewhat doubtful about those alleged relationships of Magnus Maximus. This thread discusses the genealogy of Magnus Maximus.$URL$ Here is a link to a family tree with a conjectural relationship with the family of Theodosius.enter link description here 

$URL$ there is a story that he practiced writing but keep his writings hidden under his pillow because of embaressment at his poor style. Chilperic I c. 539-584 as a Frankish king with some degree of culture. 

According to Roman Law, the child of a male slave or of a free man and a slave woman was a slave like his/her mother - the status of slave passed from mother to child. Thus the child of a freedman would be either born free or born a slave depending on the status of his/her mother. Freedmen had the status of Roman citizens - though second class citizens still partially dependent on their former masters. A male child born to a freedman and a free mother - even if she may once have been a slave - was a free born Roman citizen, though usually of low status. As I remember, Emperor Publius Helvius Pertinax Augustus, was born to a freedman Helvius Successus and rose in society to be a military officer, a senator, a governor, a consul, and finally emperor. Emperor Marcus Opellius Severus Macrinus Augustus is also said to have been the son of a freedman according to some sources. 

Among the heirs of Kublai Khan who ruled as both Chinese emperors and Mongol Kakhans, there were several who ascended the throne a lot younger than 15. After they were overthrown in China by the Ming they remained Mongol Kakhans. One of the most famous of them, Dayan Khan, was put on the throne by the widow of the previous Kakhan when he was 5. She married him when he was a teenager and had many sets of twin boys with him. Dayan Khan had a long and successful reign. 

I strongly doubt that any medieval person was knighted if they were believed or known to be female. However, many high ranking females commanded armies or led the defense of cities and castles. And no doubt many women fought in the sense of shooting arrows or whacking enemies with axes and swords or stabbing them with spears or swords. Here are examples of the three types of female military leaders and warriors. Gwenllian ferch Gruffydd (c. 1100-1136) was the wife of Gruffydd ap Rhys, Prince of Deheubarth. In 1136 her husband traveled to Gwynedd to convince her father King Gruffydd ap Cynan to help him fight the Normans. Normans invaded Deheubarth while Gruffydd was away, and Gwenllian led an army to fight them. She was defeated near Kidwelly Castle. Her son Morgan (c. 1116-1136) was killed in the battle and Gwenllian and her son Maelgwn (c. 1119-1136) were captured and beheaded. $URL$ Eleanor of Aquitaine (c.1122/24-1204) was beseiged in the castle of Mirebau in 1201. $URL$ Jeanne Laisne (born 1456) was at the siege of Beuvuais in 1472. A Burgundian climbed the battlements and planted a flag there. Jeanne, ax in hand, pushed him off the wall and threw down the flag, reviving the courage of the defenders, and became known as Jeanne hachette. $URL$ And there are many more examples of each type. 

$URL$ So according to this, your example of barry of eight sable and gules would violate the tincture rule. I know that barry of nine gules and sable, which equals gules, four bars sable, and any other variation with an odd number of parts, would violate the rule of tincture. I have often seen illustrations of coats of arms that seem to have sable and another color, but don't because the argent parts were painted with silver paint that tarnished over time and turned black. For example, Hungary ancient might appear to be barry of eight, gules and sable, because the agent in the depiction was silver paint that turned black. The article doesn't give the source for variations of the field being subject to the tincture rule, but does list several sources for the tincture rule in general. Balfour Paul, James (1893).
