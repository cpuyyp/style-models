So Archelaus is credited with more military growth then all Macedonian kings before him. Specifically for fortification of cities. As mentioned above, Pella lies along a main North-South route, along the Varder-Axios river valley. This would be a natural route from the interior lands into Macedonia. Fortifications built here control your northern frontier. This is discussed in In the Shadow of Olympus: The Emergence of Macedon By Eugene N. Borza The availability of resources, such as grain and fresh water, though it may seem of economic value to us, is also of prime military importance. When Sitalces invaded through that northern frontier, as mentioned by Thucydides , the Macedonian population "retired all within their strongholds and walled towns". If you had the resources you could do that. The Wikipedia article, though not very in-depth, says his invasion ended when "He was obliged to retire through failure of provisions." (A bit of diplomacy and a marriage helped. Emphasis mine) So the location offered control of the northern frontier, access to the sea, and resources to enable one to be able to withstand a siege. Looks like a good choice to me. Location, Location, Location. 

An article cited by the OP brings up a couple of possible groups which may have complied with this, The Holy Roman Empire under Conrad III and the region referred to as Flanders. So we can look at the extent of any ranged weapon bans in those locations. 

It looks like around 7-8 weeks ship time. See update below. (Inserted new info at top, ahead of the background info on the avisos ships and routes.) --- UPDATE --- Finally found actual info on the travel time for the avisos. This book concerning the HMS Centurion actually lists the transit time for the avisos San Lorenzo as 41 days. This put the ship at Puerto Rico. Leaving there on Jan 31st, detained by British on Feb 3rd, and after rescue and various engagements reaches Santiago Cuba on Feb 12, after 12 more days. Then it apparently took two more weeks (inland Travel?) before the message was finally delivered to the Governor of Cuba, Juan de Prado,on Feb 26th 1762, informing him that Spain and Britain were at war. So 53 days travel time to Cuba, plus a couple more weeks delivery time. (And this just got us to Havana.) 

This does seem to be confirmed via several sources. The book Harry S. Truman: His Life and Times By Brian Burnes mentions Truman's music on page 14, where after Eugene List had played, it says 

Note this is a proposed flag, and is not officially recognized. As such I don't know that there is an 'official' color set described. The wiki article further states: 

I agree with the comments, it doesn't look military in nature. Looking at various organization, I finally found an item listed on ebay which seems to match both the wide emblem and the tasseled 8-point star with cross inset. I've zoomed in on part of the image showing the large emblem on the sash, revealing the motto Amicitia Amor et Veritas or in English: "Friendship, Love and Truth". So it appears your ancestor was an Odd Fellow (no insult intended). 

The above from The New Statistical Account of Scotland: Inverness, Ross and Cromarty, W. Blackwood and Sons, 1845 

Another website blames a price drop due to a glut on the market in Miami for the creation of this form: 

The image isn't great, but it lists a museum source.The CS ovals appear irregular, which would coincide with the PBS story concerning civil war buckles: 

The article you cite seems to mainly discuss a book, “The House of Government” by Yuri Slezkine. The quote you are looking for is from this book, page 736. There is a footnote, #47, which is an ibid to note 46. 46 says AMDNN, "Poloz" file, "Lichnoe delo No. 90365." 

In general, the public activity of smoking was introduced to Europe on an industrial scale, from the colonies. The level of production by the revolution: 

So 20ft, or 6m appears to be the maximum distance a wooden beam bridge structure could be reasonably be expected to span. This also coincides with the estimate of the size of the drawbridge at Leeds. 

Another source mentions a wintering area that was used, located just south of the area shown on the OP's map: 

Spain was more likely to arrest foreigners who did manage to cross the unwelcoming wilderness separating New Mexico from the rest of the (non-Spanish) world. 

Though there may have been logging smaller trees earlier, It appears that the first well documented felling of one of the giant trees may have been in 1853: 

Another essay here agrees that silver was the main focus of trade with China, though some goods were traded: 

Another source,The Horse in the Ancient World, by Ann Hyland (with a limited view however) seems to agree with the above figures on pg 37: 

A horse has several movement styles, called gaits, the slowest of which is the walk. According to this entry: 

The Wikipedia article on the Alaska Purchase discusses the population of Alaska before the purchase: 

A crater 1200 feet in diameter. A crater this size would destroy a few city blocks, but 1/2 mile away it just knocked over a test structure. This test is what they keep mentioning in later references. The Truman library has a lot of documents, concerning tests, target selection, ect. The last couple pages of one document has some related reports from after the bomb was dropped, both of which express surprise at the results, and compare to the first test (emphasis mine): letter from Admiral Edwards to Admiral Leahy, 6 Aug 

Not as many as you might think. From The Adventures of Captain Bonneville, U.S.A., in the Rocky Mountains and the Far West..., Volume 2 By Washington Irving, Benjamin Louis Eulalie de Bonneville(pg 449) 

But that's were the simple explanations end. The city you are discussing, Carteia, really is a transition point, and is literally the first colony of its kind. Up to this point the Roman colonies were pretty close to home. Carteia, located near the Straits of Gibraltar, in the then Roman territory of Hispania, was a garrisoned city that had existed since 940 BC. It had been captured by the Romans in 190 BC. 

We have some historical sources concerning the Mongols, the primary one being Marco Polo. We can refer to his original information when referring to the Mongol messenger system, known as the Yam. From The book of Ser Marco Polo, the Venetian: concerning the kingdoms and marvels of the East 

(This source claims the debt was 34,000, and that Eaton raised 12,000 by selling the Gloria for $7000 and other belongings for $5000, Morris made up difference of $22,000.) 

Look over some of these sources, and you will get the impression of a definite military force, which was organized, trained and supplied by other Arab states. (I would clip some quotes, but these works are all recent, so you will have to look them over yourselves. Sorry) 

So the source of 'Canadian Tuxedo" definitely predates the above mentioned 1973 wool shortage. See also urban dictionary Levi's Vintage Clothing Brings Back The Original "Canadian Tudo" 

The direct portion of your question seems to reference 'did any country threaten war on the US because they didn't pay their debt after the Revolutionary War?' Whether relevant to your test question concerning Hamiltons thoughts on dealing with the debt, there was definitely conflict with other nations over this debt, France in particular. This conflict began in 1793, almost immediately following the overthrow of the monarchy during French Revolution. The new regime sent an ambassador to the US, Edmond Charles Genêt, beginning what is called The Citizen Genêt Affair (emphasis mine) 

The second image seems to represent this type of scene, showing the fruits and cakes waiting to be sacrificed to ensure a good harvest. 

So the military effect is established. There were military casualties. The military base existed. I don't see a problem characterizing Hiroshima, in the radio address of Aug 9, as a military base. (on a side note, if you ask someone in the military where they were stationed, a typical reply might be 'San Diego' for instance-not 'Naval Base San Diego') In the radio address I doubt there was any thought that the public would have any idea where or what Hiroshima was. The term 'a military base' is just descriptive. 

Census information from 1950 can be read in Census of Population: 1950: Number of inhabitants, By United States. Bureau of the Census Table 24, pages 1-48 thru 1-64 contains the populations of each city in each state, alphabetical by state. Whatever you need is in there. On a guess at what you don't have, here's some excerpts: 

The thought processes was that each employed woman was taking that job away from an unemployed man. With unemployment rampant, this was the time leading into the depression in the US, and economic collapse in Germany(not sure where your question is referencing in particular), it seemed more important to lower the overall unemployment rate. You can find several books discussing this, and the practice was not limited to Germany. This book discusses similar behaviors in Great Britain and Czechoslovakia in the same time frame. 

The Kingdom of Aksum is dated from 100–940 CE. The sailing technology of this time frame is way beyond Egyptian papyrus rafts. This begins almost 200 years after the battle of Actium ,one of the great naval battles of the time, and in fact one of the trade partners mentioned is the Roman, and later Byzantine empire. From wiki page on Indo-Roman trade relations 

So if we take this (lengthy) document at face value, over 400 (most) were settled at the Supreme Court level. 

The model 1859 was ordered for Berdans Sharpshooters during the civil war. The slightly modified model,made to Berdan's specs, cost $42.50. Source:Sharpshooting in the Civil War, By Major John Plaster 

The Ilmena is listed as 'purchased from the Americans' on the Russia-America Company wiki page. So there's your ship name, and yes he was employed in the fur trade. 

So this strongly implies she would have read her fathers book, Reason, The Only Oracle of Man. It also points out that she thought of herself as being an infidel for her views then, so we can deduce she did agree with the views espoused in his book (during her youth) but in later adulthood had a different opinion on the matter (hence the infidel part). I find no direct acknowledgement of her fathers book by title or author, but since most of the recorded record of her is from the Catholic period of her life, that probably makes sense. 

Of course this would be a conservative time estimate, since an organization such as The Worshipful Company of Fletchers, which was one of the famous Livery Companies of London would have had the organization and power to increase production rates, especially at time of war. These sheaf arrows would have been produced in a 'guild' situation, with masters overseeing apprentices and laborers working all stages of production concurrently, and as with any craft, 'tricks of the trade' would have increased the production rate in ways we can only guess at. This figure does provide, however an appreciation of the time and labor involved. 

The style of decorative facing over the structural element was continued, but the structural concrete was phased out and replaced with structural stone or brick elements. An earlier version (published 1905) of the above book can be read here and it has dozens of references to the use of concrete, several mentions concerning the use of concrete in Byzantine construction: Page 212, in a discussion of characteristics of Byzantine Architecture: 

(emphasis mine) Note: my answer was to the question as originally worded:Were there children in Auschwitz?, and to the contention that children would have been summarily killed because they were unable to work. 

Note: As @PieterGeerkens points out in comments this may have been a special occurrence, essentially a forced march, and the typical average pace may have been less. His answer to another question on feeding these massive herds has good information on the logistics concerning grazing such large herds of horses, well worth a look. 

Sheep. The study also addresses sheep sizes, with estimates on withers heights falling into a range typically between 58 and 63 cm. Since modern sheep show ranges between 60 and 80 cm, it falls in line that the sheep were the size of smaller modern animals. From pg 50: 

Battleships were built to engage at range. Even at that time, the rangefinding gear was fairly extensive. Concerning the HMS Barham, one of the ships in the engagement: 

These images are from the Villa Poppaea, and seem to represent an ornamental torch used in Roman religious rites. The first image is from the base of a full wall fresco shown here representing a view of a sacrificial tripod resting on a column: The image from the question is a bit distorted, but you can see and read more here, where the item is described as (emphasis mine) a 

This source, International Encyclopedia of Military History edited by James C. Bradford, while discussing crossbows, confirms the information that Conrad III, (Holy Roman Emperor from 1138-1152), 

The edit to the question gives us more information to go on (and please remember to include all relevant information when asking questions in the first place. It can save hours of unnecessary time spent researching in the wrong areas or with incorrect search terms.) But it also makes an assumption that an American from Vermont is not wearing a European based uniform. You might want to refer to this document by the Vermont Historical society concerning civil war era uniforms.( Pdf pg 5, document pg 88) It discusses that fact that many of the militias had varied uniform styles, some opting more direct copies from European uniforms.
