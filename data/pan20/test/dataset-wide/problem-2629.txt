Why philosophers? Why not world famous scientists who thought religion was necessary? I would suggest that you read a Kindle book named Quantum Physics and Ultimate Reality: Mystical Writings of Great Physicists by Michael Green. It has their thoughts on God, religion, and science and religion. Included are Planck, Einstein, Bohr, Heisenberg, Schroedinger, Pauli, Eddington, Bohm, and others. Planck is quoted as saying: 

According to Eastern philosophy, the brain is an organ and suffers death just like the rest of your body. What carries over into a next life is 'impressions' - karma so to speak which happens until your soul escapes the cycles. Buddhists would say that the inertial force of a previous wave carries over into the next manifested wave. From a cosmological viewpoint, the universe is another wave that has it's ebb and tide. After the ebb cycle, a new universe starts. But the sequence of events in each new universe is like throwing a pair of dice. You throw them and get a sequence of 3,7,11 for example. After many more throws you get the same sequence. Maybe 1 time you have to throw 100 times to get the sequence, another time 560 times before the sequence reappears. But it eventually repeats the sequence. Same with events in a universe. Maybe after 5,560,431,280 universes (each lasting tens of billions of years, and maybe some of those universes had different physical laws so they were pretty messed up), the same sequence of events appears as now. Your physical body is reborn and goes through the same events. But, according to Eastern philosophy, another soul is now occupying your body [too long to explain this]. But to your body there is no sense of time between each, all those other universes never existed for it. So in a sense your body is eternal also. 

We are all born weak so I'm unclear about the question other than to say "by protecting the weak"(our children) "we are becoming strong." (a family, a community, a society, a Nation.) Killing children as a policy is usually frowned upon...but certainly "blotting out bloodlines" is quite replete in History...so one answer might be "they're an easy kill." Not all pups all welcome in the litter. 

The scientific method is very rigourous. It begins in my view with an expectational proof ("no matter in nature can either be created or destroyed") and then proceeds to prove said hypothesis using carefully calibrated instruments and techniques the absolute truth of the hypothesis. In order to secure validity it must be repeatable as well. It is the aposite of "statisical theory" which while critical in an engineering faculty is a dangerous foil when working with items of tremendous volatility or uncertain properties. Controls not just to prove the hypothesis are critical but also to keep the "scientists" from being harmed. For a textbook example read or Google "tickling the Dragon's Tail." 

Agree with the comments above concerning such a thing as "Scientific reasoning." There is such a thing as the Age of Reason (circa the late 19th Century) where many of us Westerners thought we had conquered ideas such as War, famine, etc through the use of "Reason" (use of evidence to advance an argument or create a greater bounty for all of humanity as two examples.) Philosophy is never to be bound by what I think they would term "such externalities." Logic is even worse sadly. Of course what is a "reasonable amount of money" is always an interesting point of inquiry.... 

"Simultaneity" happens all the time (so to speak.) For example a "fortuitous" encounter is the chance meeting of someone expected to meet in the future that does in fact happen but not according to any plan or "foresight." There is also "spontaneity" where you are "acting" in present time but not really "knowing" where you are going with whatever it is you're thinking or are uncertain as to the outcome. There is also the idea of "serendipity"... a chance meeting that seems to assure one's "future" for all time. These and many other "facts of living" prove that while presentism existsit is only a construct of the mind and not in fact how we as humans nor any other sentient being in fact exists. Birds build nests, whales sing songs...all with a "future purpose" in mind (having shelter, getting food, etc) Humans are unique in explicitly doing away with time in order to discover "truths" however. The technical term I believe is called "instinct" or in sports "being in the zone" where you are not conscious of time when "acting." For example we have yet to discover any other living organism that attempts to build something like a Cathedral...which we know will require generations or "not in our time" to be completed. This is a unique form of "presentism" as it requires a type of plan that can be understood in the here and now AND in the future thus implying some type of "Master Plan" or "destiny." Of course if I take a well worn footpath and turn it into a road and then some type of highway or "interchange" this might seem to imply some greater intelligence on my part but in reality I'm just trodding the same path and merely expanding (or expounding) on the possibilities should I consider more doing the same. This "more of the same" is neither in the present nor having to do with "simultaneity" but simply projecting out "into the future" what is merely observed. Technically speaking such "thinking" is false as if everything is "just a roll of the dice" the "odds" are still the same...namely the number is the number observed not the odds of said number "going to be observed." One could argue and be right however if the dice are rolled and two sixes appear every time that "there is a problem with the dice." As Einstein famously said "God does not play dice with the Planets." 

Read some of Stephen Jay Gould's books, two to start with are "The Panda's Thumb" and "Hen's Teeth and Horse's Toes". If you're not familiar with his name he had an untimely death about 2001 or 2002 from cancer if I remember correctly. Was a professor at Harvard and prolific writer on evolution. His class was the first to fill at Harvard in the 90s. His books are still available. All your questions above are answered in his books. 

So the feeling that the Perceiver is outside is a creation of your mind. The Perceiver is your innermost soul, or the Atman, and that innermost soul is one with Brahman. 

other examples include Katha Upanishad (I. ii. 15) "It is AUM"; Katha Upanishad (I. ii. 17) "This AUM is the best support"; Taittiriya Upanishad (I. viii. 1) "AUM this word is Brahman." Swami Nikhilananda says (The Upanishads, V2, pp 223-224): 

Yes. A Hindu philosopher by the name of Gaudapada wrote a commentary on the Mandukya Upanishad called Gaudapada's Karika. It is a defense of the Hindu Advaita (non-dual) monistic philosophy. Chapters 2, 3, and 4 specifically are arguments for the non-dual Brahman using reasoning and logical argumentation alone, no scriptural references. In those chapters Sankara in his commentary of the Karika gives opposing arguments of nihilists and materialists and defends his arguments against those opposing views as well. He gives arguments that the only reality is the non-dualistic Brahman and that the world or reality that is perceived is an illusion. It is best read in conjunction with the Mandukya Upanishad and Shankaracharya's commentary on both (also referred to as Adi Sankara or simply Sankara). Another good one is Plotinus's Six Enneads. I also like Quantum Physics and Ultimate Reality: Mystical Writings of Great Physicists by Michael Green 

The first known "Political Parties" or "factions" as they were first termed that I am aware of were noted during the ratfication of the US Constitution. "Federalist" Party members were pro Constitution and "anti-Federalist" were against...and this was noted with some alarm during the ratification process as "office seeking" was seen as ungentlemanly. In other words one should asked first before one "becomes President" for example. Alexander Hamilton is the first and only proponent of "ambition" as the pre-requisite for Governing...meaning "do not ask but take." He actually wanted George Washington to be elected President for life in his only appearance before the Constitutional Committee meeting...in secret interestingly...in Philadelphia in 1789. This idea was never considered...but certainly Hamilton's "men of ambition" future was born out...and with it poltical parties. 

Start going about town ranting and raving like a lunatic while declaiming all authority and you''ll be fine. 

We do rely on "instrumentation" in order to move beyond the limiations imposed by our senses. Still..we do use the same "mind" normatively to extrapolate. This is "normally" an error however since any observed phenomnen is only just that: observed. Is the subject round or square or trapazoidal? There certainly are boundaries but yet again we find ourselves back to instrumentation in order to measure, define, explain. But to extrapolate...to infer from one law an even greater "law" assumes the impossible. Basically we have to go "Star Trekking" to find out. In short "mistakes will be made." 

There seems to be a moral sensibility presented by the author through the use of the term "promise." Since a promise is something that will happen in the future I think the author needs to use a more accurate term. Kant wanted to "rebalance" truth since there is no duty to tell it and indeed an infinite number of reasons not to (to protect your buddies on the battlefield for example.) So how do we achieve our HIGHER calling of "informing on the matter accurately"? Obviously Kant is quite strict on this matter as he sees (correctly) the need for not just the truth but for the truth to " get to the top."(Fog of War for example...or perhaps informational disadvantage in the current context.) So the "residue" does indeed become a contradiction because me and my "posse" are probably going to have to lie to survive in this thing called life...but I still owe my Tribal Chief something too otherwise I might not even have my posse without my Chief. That's my take on the "categorical imperative" as presented here namely "more than a promise." Is it a duty? The author does not elaborate sadly. 

Swami Vivekananda speaking in the late 1890s said - "We believe in nature being without beginning and without end; only at psychological periods this gross material world of the outer universe goes back to its finer state, thus to remain for a certain period, again to be projected outside to manifest all this infinite panorama we call nature. This wavelike motion was going on even before time began, through eternity, and will remain for an infinite period of time." The Complete Works of Swami Vivekananda, Vol. 3, p. 374. There were an infinite number of universes before and there will be an infinite number of universes in the future. There is no creation per se. There is only projection. 

It is your English that is tripping you up. Don't read nothing read no-thing or no thing. Very different from nothing. 

Non-dual refers to non-dualistic philosophies. Among them are the Advaita Vedanta of Hinduism, Buddhism, and Sankhya Yoga. A good intro that talks about non-duality in different philosophies is "Non-Duality: A Study In Comparative Philosophy" by David Loy. Humanities Press, 1988. 

Your question - "So why is this 'problem of evil' used as evidence against the idea of a superior Being?" This problem of evil as evidence against a superior Being only arises in the western monotheistic traditions. It does not arise in the Eastern traditions. In an Eastern context, there is no good or evil, both are illusions. There is only God, the non-dualistic Brahman. Good and evil are illusions that can be seen only from a relative standpoint, not an absolute standpoint. Good and evil are relative terms, there are no absolute good or evils. What is considered evil in one location at one time is not necessarily evil at another time or place. Example: Several hundred years ago it was a common accepted practice in Europe to put a deformed or crippled newborn outside the dwelling and put them "in the hands of God". Of course what happened was they froze to death, starved to death, or were eaten by wandering animals. This was not considered evil. Today such an action would be considered evil. Even today, what may be considered good in one culture is evil in another. From the standpoint of the Godhead, all the worlds and their objects are reduced to an illusory appearance. Does the water in a mirage make the earth wet? Likewise, how can illusory evil affect the One Reality? How can illusory good affect the One Reality? (Pancadasi II. 97.) There is no free will. Krishna says in the Bhagavad Gita (XVIII. 60-61.) "Bound by your own karma, O Son of Kunti, which is born of your very nature, what through delusion you seek not to do, you shall do even against your own nature. The Lord dwells in the hearts of all beings, O Arjuna, and by His maya causes them all to revolve as though mounted on a machine." David Loy in his book Nonduality: A Study in Comparative Philosophy quotes William Blake's Vision of the Last Judgment:
