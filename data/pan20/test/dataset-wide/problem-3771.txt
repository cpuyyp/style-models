Graph theory and trellis graphs are related, for example, in Chapter 2 of this MSc. Thesis, M. Stylianou, Evaluating the Network Survivability issue of K-best Paths through Graph Theoretic Techniques, Univ. Cyprus, June, 2005. Another interesting work is S.D. Nikolopoulos, Addressing network survivability issues by finding the K-best paths through a trellis graph, Proc. Sixteenth Annual Joint Conference of the IEEE Computer and Communications Societies - INFOCOM '97, IEEE, Vol.1, pp. 370-377, 1997. From the abstract, *In this paper we aim to offer a solution in the selection of the K-best disjoint paths through a network by using graph theoretic techniques. The basic approach is to map an arbitrary network graph into a trellis graph which allows the application of computationally efficient methods to find disjoint paths. * In the Appendix, the author presents an algorithm named Net-to-Trellis ...with a help of an example the processes of transforming a network G(V,E, c) into a A trellis graph. ...

Some software packages at Wikipedia here At CASC (Center for Applied Scientific Computing) there is ODEPACK (Serial FORTRAN solvers for Ordinary Differential Equation initial value problems) here and BABEL: "Babel provides high-performance language interoperability and middleware for scientific applications. It also provides coarse-grained distributed computing using remote method invocation. Babel currently supports C, C++, Java, Python, and various dialects of Fortran." Also, you can try SUNDIALS (SUite of Nonlinear and DIfferential/ALgebraic equation Solvers) available here. SUNDIALS provides a Matlab interface to CVODES (solves IVP for ODE systems), IDA (solves IVP dor DAE systems) and KINSOL (solves nonlinear algebraic problems). 

I am looking for references on Steinmetz Transform and its relation with Laplace and Fourier Transforms. There is an Italian Wikipedia page about this topic but with no references. 

I think that a strong foundation in undergraduate calculus is enough. The definitive reference in Distribution Theory is Laurent Schwartz, Theorie des Distributions, Herman, 1997 (in French). A good reference (in English): Robert Strichartz, A Guide to Distribution Theory and Fourier Transforms, CRC, 1994. A very informative and interesting book is The Prehistory of the Theory of Distribution, J. Lutzen, Springer, 1982.

Bell & Sons, Ltd., 1915, available here: Where computation is performed to any considerable extent, computer's desk will be found useful. Those used in the mathematical laboratory of the University of Edinburgh are 3' 0" wide, 1'9" from front to back, and 2'6 1/2" high. They contain a locker, in wich computing paper can be kept without being folded, and a cupboard for books, papers, drawing-board, arithmometer, or instruments. Each desk is supplied with a copy of Barlow's tables (which gives the square, square root, cube, cube root and the reciprocal of all numbers up to 10,000), a copy of Creller's multiplication table (which gives at sight the product of any two numbers each less than 1000), and tables giving the values of the trigonometric functions and logarithms Question: Are there any available picture of this "computer desk" ?

In 1971, T.S. Huang published a paper in IEEE Computer, May-June, pp.15, called How the Fast Fourier Transform Got its Name, available here. At the bottom of the paper, he wrotes: "The Chinese emperor's name was Fast, so the method was called the Fast Fourier Transform" :-) The question is: there is another version for FFT's name? First time the word FAST was used? 

Oliver Heaviside, on page 387 of Electrical Papers, Vol. I, Macmillan and Co., 1892, available here, writes $$v = 1 - \frac{n^2r^2}{2^2} + \frac{n^4r^4}{2^2 4^2} - \frac{n^6r^6}{2^24^26^2} + \ldots = J_0(nr)$$ and This function is usually denoted by $J_0(nr)$, and was first employed by Fourier. Whether he invented it or discovered it is a doubtful point; the question is raised whether mathematical truths lie within the human mind alone, or whether the infinite body of known and unknown mathematics could exist in a dead universe. But this is metaphysics, which is all vanity and vexation of spirit. Heaviside gives no reference. I have two questions: 

See, for example, P. Sebah, X. Gourdon, Introduction to the Gamma Function, available here. Topic 5.1.5, page 13, is about Zeros of the digamma function. We can see that on the negative axis, the digamma function has a single zero between each consecutive negative integers (the poles of the gamma function). The authors presents the first five zeros of the digamma function on the negative axis with 50 decimal places. ADDED: I have found this beautiful manuscript written by Hermite, with reference to gamma functions, Cours de M. Hermite, Librairie Scientifique A. Hermann, 1883. Also, the complete Oeuvres de Charles Hermite is available here. Another reference is NIST Digital Library of Mathematical Functions

Modulation is used to reduce antenna height, noise distortion, to avoid interference... The low frequency signal (e.g., human voice) is superimposed to a high frequency signal (the carrier) and transmited. Every radio station have its own high frequency (carrier frequency) of transmission. When you tune your radio (choosing the carrier frequency of the radio station), you're also indicating the electronic circuit to be used to demodulate (extract information from the carrier) AM or FM signals to recover the (low frequency) human audible signal. See any book from B.P. Lathi (e.g. Modern Digital and Analog Communication System) or from Oppenheim (e.g Signals and Systems). These are classical books used in Electric Enginnering courses. According to Lathi, the AM signal can be demodulated coherently (demodulation synchronous) or noncoherently (demodulation assynchronous). In practice, two demodulation noncoherent methods are used: (1) rectifier detection and (2) envelope detection. (1) Rectifier Detector: If an AM signal is applied to a diode and resistor circuit, the negative part of the AM wave will be supressed. The rectified output, $v_r(t)$, is: $$v_r(t) = [A+m(t)]\cos \omega_ct [1/2 + 2/\pi(\cos\omega_ct- 1/3 \cos3\omega_ct + \ldots)] = 1/\pi[A + m(t)] + hft$$ where $hft$ are high frequency terms, $m(t) = B \cos\omega_mt$ is the information (low frequency signal), $\omega_m$, information frequency, $\omega_c$, carrier frequency, $A$ and $B$, amplitude of carrier and low frequency signals, respectively. When $v_r(t)$ is applied to a low-pass filter of cutoff $B$ Hz, the output is $[A +m(t)]/\pi$, and all the other terms in $v_r$ of frequencies higher than $B$ Hz are supressed. The dc term $a/\pi$ may be blocked by a capacitor to give the desired output $m(t)/\pi$. (2) Envelope Detector: the output of the detector follows the envelop of the modulated signal. The circuit is a diode followed by a RC-filter. Mathematical details in Lathi. The information (low frequency signal) in FM resides in the instantaneous frequency $\omega_i = \omega_c + k_f m(t)$, $k_f$ is a modulation index. A frequency-selective network with a transfer function $$|H(\omega)| = a\omega + b$$ over the FM band would yield an output proportional to the instantaneous frequency, $\omega_i$. There are several possible networks with such characteristics, the simplest is an ideal differentiator with transfer function $j\omega$. The mathematical details can be seen in Lathi. There is a tutorial here or here. BTW, this is a very beautiful (real) application of Fourier Theory. ADDED: In relation to your question, if we have $$\phi_{AM}(t) = A \cos\omega_ct + f(t)\cos\omega_ct$$ representing the AM signal and $$\phi_{FM}(t) = A \cos\omega_ct - A k_f g(t)\sin\omega_ct$$ representing the FM signal, then $$\phi_{AM}(t) \leftrightarrow \frac{1}{2}[F(\omega + \omega_c) + F(\omega - \omega_c)] + \pi A [\delta(\omega + \omega_c) + \delta(\omega - \omega_c)]$$ and $$\phi_{FM}(t) \leftrightarrow \pi A [\delta(\omega + \omega_c) + \delta(\omega - \omega_c)] + j\frac{Ak_f}{2}[G(\omega - \omega_c) - G(\omega + \omega_c)] $$ Considering $$v(t) = \phi_{FM}(t) + \phi_{AM}(t)$$ we have the Fourier transform: $$\frac{1}{2}[F(\omega + \omega_c) + F(\omega - \omega_c)] + 2 \pi A [\delta(\omega + \omega_c) + \delta(\omega - \omega_c)] + j\frac{Ak_f}{2}[G(\omega - \omega_c) - G(\omega + \omega_c)]$$ The next step is to adapt your equation to these equations. Then, procedures (1) or (2) should be used to recover the low frequency signal in the receiver side.

In 1993, Prof. L.N. Trefethen published a NA-net posting with a list of thirteen paper he used for teaching the seminar Classic Papers in Numerical Analysis. In Trefethen's words, ... this course provided a satisfying vison of the broad scope of numerical analysis and the sense of excitement at what a diversity of beautiful and powerful ideas have been invented in this field. Prof. Trefethen's list (links): 

Wikipedia presents butterfly as "a portion of the computation that combines the results of smaller discrete Fourier transforms (DFTs) into a larger DFT, or vice versa (breaking a larger DFT up into subtransforms). The name "butterfly" comes from the shape of the data-flow diagram in the radix-2 case ..." The question is: What was the first time that FFT was represented by Butterfly Diagram ? References would be appreciated.

According to Wikipedia, an autobiography is an account of the life of a person, written by that person sometimes with a collaborator. An autobiography offers the author the ability to recreate history. From this point of view, to some extent, a mathematician autobiography tell us much about the history of mathematics itself.

I recommend The Man Who Counted, an amazing fiction book about a fictitious mathematician called Beremiz Samir and a traveler called Malba Tahan. The first two chapters tell how Malba Tahan was traveling from Samarra to Baghdad when he met Beremiz Samir, a young lad with amazing mathematical abilities. The traveler then invited Beremiz to come with him to Baghdad, where a man with his abilities will certainly find profitable employment. The rest of the book tells various incidents that befell the two men along the road and in Baghdad. In all those events, Beremiz Samir uses his abilities with calculation like a magic wand to amaze and entertain people, settle disputes, and find wise and just solutions to seemingly unsolvable problems. In the first incident along their trip (chapter III), Beremiz settles a heated inheritance dispute between three brothers. Their father had left them 35 camels, of which 1/2 (17.5 camels) should go to his eldest son, 1/3 (11.666... camels) to the middle one, and 1/9 (3.888... camels) to the youngest. To solve brother's dilemma, Beremiz convinces Malba to donate his only camel to the dead man's estate. Then, with 36 camels, Beremiz gives 18, 12, and 4 animals to the three heirs, making all of them profit with the new share. Of the remaining two camels, one is returned to Malba, and the other is claimed by Beremiz as his reward. ADDED:

In Bers, genus g is used... UPDATE: About the word genus, see the comment of Martin Brandenburg, above. As a complementary information, A.R. Forsyth, Theory of Functions of a Complex Variable, Cambridge, 1918, writes (last paragraph, p.371): "If the connectivity of a closed surface with a single boundary be 2p+1, the surface is often said to be of genus p" In the footnote: (genus) Sometimes class. The German word is Geschlecht; French writers use the word genre, and Italians genere. By the way, in Portuguese, classe or genero. On p.109, "Laguerre appears to have been the first to discuss the class of transcendental integral functions" I think p stands for point. In I.M. James, History of Topology, Elsevier, 1999, we can see on pp. 39, last paragraph, "For the sketch of a proof Poincaré collected all types of differential equations on an algebraic curve of given genus p an with given….". On note (38), same page, "p is regular singular point of the differential equation …"
