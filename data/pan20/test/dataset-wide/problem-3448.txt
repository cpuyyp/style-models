In simplistic national accounts terms $$Y=C+I+X-M$$ is an expenditure identity while $$Y=C+S$$ is a use of income identity. Implicitly this gives $$S-I=X-M$$ suggesting an excess of saving over investment in an open economy corresponds to a trade surplus in the current account, which in turn corresponds to an outflow in the financial account: the excess of savings over investment leads to an increase in overseas assets. In a closed economy with no exports, imports or international financial flows, this forces $S=I$ and so no excess of saving over investment. Any production not used for consumption or normal investment has the effects either of increasing stocks (another form of investment) or of being valueless (so not counting towards income or saving). 

The extra benefit to you, beyond what you pay for your iPhone and for your Netflix subscription, is called consumer surplus and in theory this could be aggregated across all consumers who take advantage of this innovation It is difficult to measure: again in theory it could be done by judging how much more individuals would be willing to pay until they were indifferent between purchasing or not purchasing 

An alternative approach would be to consider the sum of the present values of the $n$ payments $$S= \dfrac{x}{(1+r)} + \dfrac{x}{(1+r)^2} + \cdots + \dfrac{x}{(1+r)^{n}}$$ and you might calculate this using the following to allow cancelation $$(1+r)S - S = x - \dfrac{x}{(1+r)^n}$$ which since $(1+r)S-S=rS$ becomes $$S=\dfrac{x}{r}-\dfrac{x}{(1+r)^n r}$$ It may be worth noting that the second term tends to zero if $n$ increases, so the value or cost of a long-term annuity approaches that of a perpetuity 

I think this may not always be true as stated You say "$U(y_s) = -\frac{1}{2}(\alpha - Y_s)^2$ for $Y_s < \alpha$" so presumably $U(y_s) = 0$ for $y_s \ge \alpha$ to avoid utilities decreasing as large prizes increase Suppose as an example $\alpha=50$ and there are two different lotteries: 

It is possible, but it involves consiberable work as you need to collect underlying income distributions across the world or to be able to estimate them. This has been done, for example in a World Bank policy research working paper 6719, Global Income Distribution From the Fall of the Berlin Wall to the Great Recession by Christoph Lakner and Branko Milanovic in December 2013. It included this chart of global income distributions: 

Iso-elastic utility is defined as a function $U(w)$ where for all $k \gt 0$ you have $$U(kw)=f(k)U(w)+g(k)$$ for some functions $f(k)$ and $g(k)$ independent of $w$, i.e. an affine transformation of the original utility function This is iso- because this kind of utility function leads to identical (or at least proportionate) decisions: it means that the optimal risk/reward behaviour at given level of wealth $w$ is also optimal for another level of wealth $kw$ if you multiply all the original investments by $k$. For example, if at some wealth level you would put a third of it into a particular risky investment and two-thirds into a particular safe investment, then with an iso-elastic utility function you would do the same with at any wealth level Both your formulations are iso-elastic in this sense, since they only differ by a constant $\frac{1}{1-\mu}$ and so lead to identical distribution decisions. The difference between them is that the first has $u(0)=0$ and $u(1)=\frac{1}{1-\mu}$ while the second has $u(1)=0$, and since that difference has no real-life implications it might be unreasonable to claim the two utility functions had different properties Those who use the second formulation often associate it with a logarithmic utility function as the limit function as $\mu \to 1$. This limit cannot be done without subtracting the $\frac{1}{1-\mu}$ (no longer a constant, since $\mu$ is changing), so they take the second formulation for arithmetical convenience 

It is more common to consider an increase in the wage rate: in that case, assuming leisure is a normal good, the income effect should increase leisure (more money available to pay for it, making it more affordable) and the substitution effect should reduce leisure (each hour worked brings greater benefit than before the increase, encouraging work), with a net effect which could go either way So with a reduction is the wage rate, you can simply reverse this: assuming leisure is a normal good, the income effect should reduce leisure (less money available to pay for it, making it less affordable) and the substitution effect should increase leisure (each hour worked brings less benefit than before the reduction, discouraging work), with a net effect which could go either way In the improbable situation that leisure were an inferior good, the income and substitution effects would work in the same directions, so a wage rate increase would lead to less leisure and a wage rate reduction would lead to more leisure 

GNI is simply a new name for GNP. It is GDP plus net primary income from abroad (i.e. with primary income paid abroad treated as negative). Primary income is described in Chapter 11 of the IMF BOP manual GNDI is GNI plus net secondary income from abroad (and similarly secondary income paid abroad is treated as negative). Net secondary income from abroad is the same thing as is meant by net current transfers from abroad: see Chapter 12 of the IMF BOP manual 

though this looks more like handwaving and rationalisation rather than something actually meaningful 

Market regulators tend to regard the first of these as bad (illegal in the US), the second as good, and the third as a natural though undesirable indicator of lack of liquidity 

If the initial populations are $p_1,p_2,p_3,p_4$ and the population growth rates are $g_1,g_2,g_3,g_4$ and the initial per capita debts are $d_1,d_2,d_3,d_4$ and the growth in per capita debts are $r_1,r_2,r_3,r_4$ then if you insist on some kind of weighted sum then you could use something like: $r_0= \displaystyle \sum _i \tfrac{ \left(\sum_j p_j\right)p_i(1+g_i)d_i}{\left(\sum_j p_j d_j\right) \left(\sum_j p_j(1+g_j)\right)}(1+r_i) - 1$ but you would probably find it easier to calculate the intermediate population totals and debt totals 

Does Okun's law work at all? It was an empirical observation of the relationship between unemployment and an estimate of the "output gap" (the relative difference between actual GDP and potential GDP) To the extent that the relative difference between actual GDP and potential GDP may be the same whether calculated using nominal GDP or real GDP, then the relationship should hold either in both cases or in neither. Otherwise the argument becomes one of saying that the output gap is affected by inflation 

But the zeros have no impact on the market shares and the Herfindahl index: having somebody extra with no share is as irrelevant as having nobody extra, and somebody with a tiny share is almost as irrelevant. Removing those zeros would lead to 

Perfect competition in the economy leads to the theoretical presumption that with firms entering the market when prices are above their average total costs and leaving when they are below average total costs, the equilibrium point comes when prices are equal to average total costs, which in turn is equal to each continuing firm's marginal cost at a point where these marginal costs are increasing. For each firm, their marginal revenue will be equal to the price set by the market. Consumers will see no firm whose marginal cost is below the market price, and so should regard the result as efficient. With increasing returns to scale, marginal costs are never increasing for an individual firm. The effect is to encourage the emergence of a single firm taking the entire market and having pricing power. This natural monopoly will lead to that firm seeing that its marginal revenue is below its price (if it lowers prices then it may gain new customers at that new price but it will lose money on existing customers) and when it maximises profits by setting prices at the point where its marginal revenue is equal to its marginal cost, that price will be higher than its marginal cost, and so be seen as economically inefficient from the perspective of consumers. 

which suggests that the paradox seems to depend on the the combined relationships between income and savings and between investment and output, together with some macroeconomic tautologies. If the relationships were different, or if the tautologies did not cause changes in equilibria, there might not be a paradox 

Try the magic of double entry bookkeeping to see that creating money does not immediately make a bank more valuable. Initially the loan is matched by a deposit, and this is creation of what is effectively money: 

So you can see that there is a greater area between the diagonal and the red curve (V1) than between the diagonal and the blue curve (V0), explaing why V1 gives a higher Gini index. This is largely due to V1 having more extremely low values than V0 does But on the right hand side, the top two values are greater for blue (the cumulative sums of the others are lower), so shares are more concentrated for V0 leading to a higher Herfindahl index 

Initially with the price and quantity at E, the combined surplus is the triangle to the left (between the orange line and the lower green line to the left of E, i.e. the pink and grey areas). But with for example a tax, the new equilibrium has consumers paying the price at C, so the new combined surplus is still between the orange line and the lower green line, but only to the left of C (i.e. the pink area). So the deadweight loss is the triangle CEF (i.e. the grey area) which is the loss in surplus associated with the reduced quantity. If all three lines are straight, and the green lines are parallel then this is the same area as the triangle CDE, but not necessarily otherwise. 

GNI is GDP plus net primary income from abroad Any such numbers are subject to revision as more information is obtained; in many countries such numbers are typically revised every three months as part of a National Accounts and Balance of Payments update, with more substantial revisions annually. Korea's latest update was published on 28 March The fact that you did not see 2017 data the first time and did see 2017 data the second time was a pointer to these two readings being across such a revision point Such numbers are typically never final, and potentially keep on changing, though after long periods revisions to numbers then tend to be affected more by methodology changes than by the arrival of new information 

You can either read this as investing 8525, taking money out to pay the 1000 and then receiving interest of 7% on the remaining balance to leave 59.29 to your credit at the end (so the twelve payments is better), or borrowing 8525 to buy initially while repaying 1000 a year to the bank and facing 7% interest on the outstanding balance leaving a debt of 59.29 owing at the end (so buying initially is worse). The surprising thing is the final amount is close to zero, and would be virtually zero if the interest rate had been about 6.93% If the payments of 1000 were at the end of the year, the final figure would have been about 1311.48, meaning the twelve payments of 1000 would be an even better choice If, instead of 7%, the interest rate were 0%, the table would end up at -3475, meaning the lump-sum upfront payment would be better 

with the Gini index being much smaller (there is less inequality when those with nothing are excluded from consideration) but the Herfindahl index staying the same, corresponding to somewhere between $5$ and $6$ equal shares You could looking at the Lorenz curves for your examples with something from the package like 

The world changed in 2008, and commercial banks substantially increased their reserves held at the central banks in many countries including the US, mainly because they did not want to lend to each other in the unsecured interbank market At that point, required reserves failed as a policy measure for fine-tuning money markets in many countries, since it amounted to pushing on a piece of string; the Bank of England removed them entirely in 2009. Several central banks moved to alternative instruments, including: 

With all these types of debt, there are various descriptions rather than standard definitions, and sometimes the same thing can be labelled with different names or the same name used for different things. In addition, they can be measure gross or net, and there will be questions of how money owed by one part of the public sector to another is treated. 

If you have $E$ working-age people in employment, $U$ unemployed but looking for work and $I$ inactive so neither working nor looking for work, then the employment rate $\frac{E}{E+U+I}$ and unemployment rate $\frac{U}{E+U}$ are related and tend to move in opposite directions So if other things remain equal (which they do not), an increase in the unemployment rate can be associated with a reduction in the employment rate and a reduction in GDP, and similarly in the opposite direction. This says nothing about causality either way The point about unemployment being a lagging indicator is that, in some business cycles, employers may sometimes respond to immediate reductions in demand by reducing working time or productivity before they move to dismissing workers, as they do not yet know whether the demand reduction is short-term or medium-term and they want to be able to respond to any quick recovery. This would be an example of other things not remaining equal
