This really depends on how much of an advantage the magical trait has. If the only way to make any use of it is through extensive and intensive schooling or if it had other consequences such as making you physically weaker or give you special requirements then it might spread slowly. If it had no downsides and gave you a noticeable competitive advantage then it would spread fast. 

I am going to need to challenge your assumption here, are you sure that the rule works in 3d labyrinths? The problem of implementation When you come to a stairs do you go up or down? With a 2 dimensional maze you only have a limited number of choices at an intersection and always turning the same way is a state-free way of guaranteeing you follow all of them. With more dimensions you need some way of knowing that you have been at this intersection before in order to know which possible exit to take and which ones you have already used. For example imagine a square room with a door on each wall and a ladder in the center going both up and down. When you reach the room do you turn left or climb the ladder? Up or down? If you've climbed up and found it is a dead end and then return to this room which exit have you already tried and which one is new? If you have a reliable compass then an algorithm like "U,N,E,S,W,D in that order might work but it is still a lot more complex than just "turn left". The problem of islands The biggest problem though is that in a 3d labyrinth it's trivial to design one where constantly turning left will never find the exit - for example just have the exit extend from a set of stairs in an island at the center. Here is a trivially simple example to illustrate: 

I would suggest genetic experiments trying to infuse people with animal DNA in order to create lower intelligence but physical powerful soldiers. Those experiments go wrong sometimes creating creatures that are either so vicious that they are untrainable or twisted and broken in some way that makes them non-viable as soldiers. Those creatures are released outside the walls for two reasons: 

Really it depends on how they work. Software Injecting a software virus to disrupt the network might work if they are reprogrammable. Rival Goo Add your own nanomachines that take apart the first ones and rebuild them to themselves then shutdown. Energy Weapons Directed energy weapons or similar might be used to destroy them without presenting them with more material to convert. Resistant materials If a material could be developed that they cannot consume (for example a sufficiently strong alloy) then something could be built to go in and handle them. Power deprivation They must be powered by something, whatever it is deprive them of it. For example if they are solar powered a large shield could be constructed between them and the sun to shield the planet and then wait until it goes dormant. Singularity Drop them in a black hole. :) Sentience If they develop intelligence then it gets much harder as they will take active counter measures. At least then you have the opportunity to negotiate though. 

Give the ships self-aware AI. The AI does most of the piloting but accepts command from the human crew and directs them where needed for repair or similar activities. The AI are loyal to planet A and will make sure they return at the end of the war. The will also fight back to defend themselves if any attempts to reverse engineer or disable them them are made. Oh, and the AI is kept secret. Planet B has no idea that the ships are entirely capable of over-riding their human crew and flying home whenever they need to until just that happens. The AI will interfere with attempted reverse engineering in a way that makes it seem like passive defenses or just bad luck for as long as it can without revealing its presence. 

There are a lot of different factors that could apply here, and in most cases it could well be a combination of factors that come together to give this result. Here are a selection of possible reasons though: Geography The two cultures evolve on different continents. Sea travel has not advanced to the point that either is capable of invading the other but they do have some contact (for example occasional adventurers, shipwreck victims, or trading vessels may cross the sea). Morality One is stronger than the other but has developed a "modern" moral standpoint where they do not attack the weaker species. Habitat incompatibility The two species live in very different areas. For example one is aquatic, one land based. Or one is adapted for cold climate and the other for hot. There would be areas where they meet and trade but the main drivers of conflict wouldn't apply as they use different resources. MAD The two species have managed to hold on and develop to the point where both have atomic weapons and a tense stand-off has developed. Religion One worships the other as gods/saints/deities/etc. Positive Inter-dependency The two species are somehow biologically important to each other, for example there is a stage in the life-cycle of one where it is dependent on another and both species benefit from the arrangement. Parasitism One could even be a parasite on the other, for example sentient cuckoos/changelings that exist hidden within the host's society and use it to raise their young. Slavery The classic case would be a stronger but less bright species and a more intelligent species. Any other unique ability such as flight could also lead to the same situation though. One species enslaves the other and uses them to provide the ability they don't have. 

The main problem with any advanced society is that we have no evidence of it left behind. Even if thousands of years passed with human vanished you would find metals, plastics, bits of railroad, remains of reinforced concrete, etc littering the landscape. This was handled in the Giant's Trilogy (James P. Hogan) by having the human civilization in question occur on another planet in our solar system. A war on that planet destroyed it and humans are descended from refugees of that war who crash landed on our planet. (There's more to it than that but I'm avoiding more spoilers than I've already given). The first book in the trilogy is "Inherit the stars" and it's really good. This nicely explains how we weren't even aware of this prior civilization until when exploring the moon we start finding things they have left behind. Really we need more details on what you want to be forgotten before we can be more specific though. Is this a few people or an entire culture. Are we talking magic or science, etc. 

When intelligent beings are first evolving and starting to explore the world there are a lot of unexplained things. Scary things, strange things, wondrous things. In trying to explain those things a natural first step is religion. Why does thunder happen? Thor did it. Why do people get sick? Evil spirits are attacking them. What happens when we die? We go to a nice place. Those explanations are seized on by people to create and maintain power for themselves. Shamans, priests, religions, all building power for individuals out of those first fumbling movements towards understanding. But is there an alternative? We know of no human societies that have not created religion in their first attempts to explain the world, even if some have then moved on. What differences in the nature of humans or in human society would be needed to have those religions either not form or fade away rapidly as new explanations are discovered. 

There is no need to travel yourself. Just mail innocuous seeming packages to every major city worldwide containing samples of the virus ready to be released when the package is opened. Mailing is far cheaper than travelling yourself so you can get close to worldwide dispersal before anyone even knows what is happening. To supplement this you can specifically target areas that are likely to be troublesome by contaminating water sources and all major disease research locations worldwide. (CDC, WHO, etc. Get people to go and infect both their administrative and research areas in person). Even with this you are unlikely to get 100% of people (there are always isolated islands, etc) but you can eliminate everyone able to do anything about it and over time the zombies will handle anything else. Pockets of survivors will be too small to need to worry about. 

Once geological processes and erosion have created a landscape this landscape will in turn alter the planet. Ocean currents and trade winds will tend to form and certain weather patterns will emerge. To keep this reasonably scoped we are just going to look at the currents, wind patterns and the resulting precipitation and climate effects. Landmass formation and erosion has been covered in previous questions and the resulting effects on life and biomes will be covered in a follow-on question. 

Sorry, but it would differ by being dead :( Take a look at my answer here: $URL$ We would struggle to build a 1km high building. The current world record is 828 meters high, which is still short a km. That's a non-moving structure made of iron and steel not a living organism of flesh and blood. There is no currently conceivable biology that would allow something as large as you are describing to survive. The tallest trees (again not mobile, but at least it's biological) is 115 meters. The good news is that the air is still breathable at that height so at least he can breathe. The problem though would be the monumental amount of air needed, the giants would need some massive adjustments to their lungs. Even if you manage to solve the structural problems the calorie requirements would be horrific to sustain a body of that size. It just doesn't seem feasible. 

1000 people is not enough for any meaningful level of scientific research to happen, you may have 1 or 2 people who retain some scientific knowledge but there is no way they would have the resources needed to advance it. Instead they would act like librarians preserving knowledge for future generations and providing what advice they can to others. 15th century is both a good and a bad time for something like this to happen. It's good because most people are already subsistence farmers, and for those people very little would change. If something like this were to happen in the modern world a lot of people would starve to death very rapidly. However it's bad because a lot of the scientific progress we currently enjoy has not yet happened, and even those advances that had been made were not commonly known. Your society will need everyone growing food, treating the injured, defending the village from monsters, etc. There will be no spare capacity for anyone who isn't providing immediate benefits, and scientific research does not provide immediate benefits. So in other words technology would stagnate at whatever point it was at when this happened. There might be minor tweaks or improvements and adaptation to the new environment but in general everything would continue as before but without any substantive progress being made. 

There is no scientific rational for saying the space industry is taking material away from earth. There are good reasons for space industry to start using materials sourced in space (for example mining The Moon, or asteroids) but that's just because it avoids the costs of lifting those materials out of The Earth's gravity well. There is a sci-fi short story though about colonists on Mars and a politician on earth started drumming up FUD about the fact that they were taking water away from Earth each time they launched and to keep their colony running, and trying to tax the water and generally rabble rousing on the subject. The story is The Martian Way, it's a Novella by Isaac Asimov. 

The problem with life is that it needs raw materials to work with. All large animals that we know of need to breathe, you need solid matter to consume, you need energy to power all of this. In space you can get solar energy but there is a big shortage of matter to use to build your own structure and to metabolize to power your own existence and growth. Even if life does manage to emerge on a comet or asteroid or similar then how is it going to travel to another one? Once you launch from the original there is no way to steer or guide your path. Think about earth's atmosphere, nothing bigger than a microbe ever permanently lives in the atmosphere. That's one of the big questions with life evolving in the atmosphere of gas giants. There just isn't enough resources there to support them. The vacuum of space is going to be even worse than either of those atmospheres. You also need to think about temperature, space is cold. Extremophile life here on earth can survive in cold temperatures, but even that would struggle in space and again it had the advantage of being able to develop in warmer conditions then gradually adapt to more extreme ones. Your best bet that I can think of will be something like a gas giant with a ring system fairly close to a star. Close enough to have liquid water under ice in the ring. (You can't have liquid water in contact with space, it instantly freezes or evaporates). Life could then develop in that water, and grow space tolerant as it comes out through the ice to access more sunlight. The fact that items in the ring are closer together would make it more feasible for seeds to spread from one asteroid to another and as the plant life develops and grows animals could then develop that feed on it. An entire ecosystem could develop among this ring system, and then as the animals and plants grow and evolve into more advanced forms they could even start so spread out beyond the original ring. For example plants that fire their seeds out at high velocity could spread throughout the entire ring system. This life would still be confined to the ring though as once anything launched itself away from a rock it would have very limited manoeuvring ability (maybe a few water jets for course correction but certainly nothing powerful enough to achieve escape velocity from a gas giants gravity well). The only way it would break free is if it found an entirely different form of propulsion, either something we aren't aware of yet or maybe something like a light sail.
