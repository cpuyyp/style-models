While this claim seems grandiose, its worth remembering that this connection is made in Aristotle's Metaphysics XI: 

So what are we to make of this? Obviously it is open to many possible interpretations and not much will be done to resolve this. Perhaps the most charitable reading would be to say that for Heraclitus, everyone has a certain equality, but that the majority do not choose to exercise that equality, that equal capacity, and so those that do, those that truly excel, should be set apart and held up as paradigms. Finally, on Popper, although the interpretation that totalitarianism may grow out of Heraclitus' thought is not in and of itself wrong, it is possible that Popper had additional reasons for offering a less charitable reading of Heraclitus: he is cited, by Engels in Anti-DÃ¼hring as a fore-runner of historical materialism. Bibliographic note: My citations of the fragments are given by their Diels-Kranz number for easy reference, e.g., in this resource. The translations are from Kahn's The Art and Thought of Heraclitus, though I have added the transliterated Greek words where I thought relevant to the question. 

To offer a fairly bold interpretation of this: the world can appear differently to each subject, even though they are presented with the same collection of facts. The subject is the limit of the world (5.632 again), meaning that the subject is transcendental to the world. The subject is an ordering function for the world; it brings together the facts and shows their connections, yet it is no part of the world (5.633). This is what it means to be a limit of the world: to give the world its shape. And hence we arrive at an interpretation of the sentence in question: it is not that the world of the happy man is some different set of facts from that of the unhappy man; it is rather that the world has a different shape, a different form, a different connection of facts. There is nothing in the world itself which gives it is sense, rather its sense is given from outside the world. Facts in the world do not by themselves "make" someone happy or unhappy. Rather it is almost the other way round: how the facts appear depends on the sense which lies beyond the limits of the world. It is a different world, but only because its limits have changed (and here its important to note that when Wittgenstein speaks of the world waxing and waning it is always the world as a whole which is capable of this---the facts remain untouched by the limits of the world, yet the connection between them, their order, changes). What might this look like? Suppose you and I were to go to an old medieval church (and I use this only as an example---I have no idea of your aesthetic tastes). To you, perhaps, the decorations, the scale and placement of the altar, the lectern and the pulpit bespeak a sense of wonder and majesty. To me, perhaps, the very same conditions seem cramped and confined, stale and musty, a building setup for a time and purpose that has long since passed. The same building can appear to us as something completely different---and yet this difference does not lie in its arrangement, in the facts about the placement of the various furnishing, in the measurable properties of the building itself. It is something else. And thus we come to what is perhaps one of the most famous sentences of the Tractatus: 

Short answer: no. Slightly longer explanation: committing the genetic fallacy depends not on using or developing a history, but on arguing that something is wrong based solely on its source. Something like: Kant's morality is wrong because Kant was a Prussian; Prussia no longer exists, and thus we can safely ignore it. Nietzsche' argument is quite a bit more complex and is based on showing that our current models of morality are based on a certain historical conception whose framework has been left aside without calling that framework into question. For example, Kant's morality is based on the promise of a "pure" reason, but really simply endorses a Christian conception of morality (I'm not saying this is exactly Nietzsche's argument; it's meant as an example that's closer to what Nietzsche is doing). In other words, for Nietzsche, our moral thinking hasn't really shed the history it claims it has overcome. What is needed is a more thorough-going criticism of our moral reasoning that ask not "what should we value", but "how should we value". 

The quote is from the preface to the first edition of Capital, although similar things can be found elsewhere in Marx's writings. To take a stab at the relation: The last sentence seems to reiterate a bit of the point of the preceding paragraph, namely that there are natural laws that guide economic and social development. The first paragraph more or less lays out that there are stages to this development that must be followed. The last sentence adds to this the claim that from the point of view of the development of society, individuals are not terribly important. Of course, society is a collection of individuals, but those individuals are who they are in part by being members of a specific society at a specific point in its development. Put a different way, Julius Caesar, brought up in 19th-century London would probably bear little resemblance to the historical Julius Caesar. 

In short, just affirming "I will die" can simply be yet another way of avoiding taking death seriously. After all, this "I" needn't be me. It could be understood as just another appearance of the "one" (das Man), and so he adds: 

Thus, it is not a matter of holding fast to "how it really was," but rather to the sparks of inspiration that still live on in memory. These sparks of inspiration is what (in my view) Benjamin means by tradition. The tradition is not something simply handed over, since it is, in a sense, still unrealised. This is why "in every epoch, the attempt must be made to deliver tradition anew"; the enemy of this task is "the conformism which is on the point of overwhelming it."** To spell this out a little more clearly: the task of any historical materialist version of history*** is the production of the self-consciousness of the proletariat. The production of this self-consciousness does not seem to form of its own accord. Why? Ultimately, Benjamin's diagnosis seems to be that people tend to identify with their rulers (this is the conformism) and hence they tend to serve "as the tool of the ruling classes." If the point of historical materialist history is to fight this tendency then it must produce a different image of history, one which says something like the conditions under which you live are not natural nor are they the only possibility. The images of the past held onto by historical materialism hence become something useful: they reveal other possibilities already present (as history, as this tradition). The point of a historical materialist conception of history is to save people from the current oppressive structures; hence it has not merely a historical purpose, but a messianic one as well. The phrase "the Messiah arrives not merely as the Redeemer; he also arrives as the vanquisher of the Anti-Christ" is meant to indicate that the purpose of historical materialist history is not simply salvation; it must also work to undo the work of "the enemy" (the ruling class) and so to utterly destroy it. Finally, it is important to remember that this is not simply some sort of abstract game. It has a real, historical context. The text was written around 1940, with the rise of the Nazi party and their concomitant re-writing of German history to produce a certain image of what being German is: the Aryan master-race that runs free over a completely Jewish-free Germany. Benjamin's hope, perhaps, was that in this moment of crisis, something else could emerge from the past, something that the Nazi's were actively trying to oppress. [*]: On the Concept of History has a complex history as a document. It was never intended nor prepared by Benjamin for publication and there are at least 7 slightly different manuscript versions of it that had been given to various of Benjamin's friends. These are all compiled in a volume from Suhrkamp's critical complete edition [Kritische Gesamtausgabe] of Benjamin's work and notebooks (which differs from the collected works [Gesammelte Schriften] that is the edition usually cited). The French edition referred to is a French translation of the document Benjamin himself made but never published. The variations in the various German editions are usually quite minor; the French has some actual departures, so I'm treating it as a source for further explicating what Benjamin is saying. [**]: In this instance the Zorn translation, published in Reflections: Essays, Aphorisms, Autobiographical Writings, is superior if somewhat more figurative:
