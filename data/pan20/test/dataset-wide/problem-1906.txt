Noise is an excuse, not the actual reason. Shredders aren't all that noisy, and could easily be operated after hours or in a utility closet where nobody would be disturbed. Most likely, they simply didn't want to spend the money. Perhaps they were just being frugal, or perhaps they were misguided. 

For some positions, applications ask many questions about the physical ability to perform a job. That isn't usually the case for software engineering in the US, but I have still seen it happen. Some of these applications ask a final question along the lines of "Do you have any limitations that could prevent you from fulfilling this position?" In that case, you need to decide if your "days that will affect your work performance" should be disclosed or not. If the application doesn't ask these sorts of questions, or if you feel that your condition would not be a limitation, then I wouldn't expect you to disclose it on the application. 

Clearly if you could be referred by someone internally, that would be to your advantage. But that only happens occasionally. Make the most of whatever you have. Some suggest finding a specific hiring manager's name and addressing the cover letter and resume directly to them as a way to bypass HR - sometimes using a special envelope or fancy paper. Some suggest sending attachments to an email directed to the hiring manager. I have not found either to be effective in any company where I've ever worked. When I was a hiring manager and I received a resume sent to me, I had to walk over and drop it off in HR anyway (or forward the email), so they could log it and enter it into the system. If anything, I always considered that a strike against the applicant for wasting my time. Some suggest trying to game the filtering software by adding keywords (perhaps in the margins using a white font on a white background). In my experience, this may have been effective in the past, but isn't these days. The filtering system I have seen personally highlights the keywords. When a "hidden keyword" gets highlighted it makes you look foolish. Just include the words and acronyms that are appropriate and natural for your resume and you'll be better served, in my experience. 

Seriously? You are stiffing the recruiter out of what he does for a living, and now you also want to get a cut of the action for yourself? I've never encountered this personally, nor have I ever even heard of this happening. It isn't considered "acceptable" when I'm the hiring manager. I don't give kickbacks if someone comes in through means other than a recruiter (except for internal referral bonuses). If you want to apply for interesting positions on your own, you can take a few approaches and still feel good about yourself: 

Tell the summer internship company that you are busy on the 4th. Arrange a different time/date to interview - perhaps after work. 

As always - it depends. If you think this indicates a pervasively disorganized company, and if you don't want to work for such a company, and if you don't need this job badly - then turn them down. Otherwise, take another shot at it, and look for signs that the company and people are too disorganized for your tastes. Whenever you interview, the hiring company is looking to see if you are a good fit for their position. You should be looking to see if the company is a good fit for you. 

I'm planning to apply to a few jobs abroad, however don't currently hold any visa to work there yet. I was told by a few friends that I shouldn't mention that I'm a foreigner until I got the chance for an interview with the company. Is this a good idea though? 

I just had an interview yesterday, and the recruiter sent me an email saying they wanted to connect with me after the interview and see my upcoming availability. How should I reply? Are they asking if I'm available to be contacted? Should I ask how and when he would like to further discuss this? 

I've been accepted to a trial period for an internship here in the US. The trial period would be a month long and they told me if they like me they're going to prolong the internship for another 2 months or so. At the same time, I got an offer to another internship abroad. However because I would require a working visa there, this would require them about 2-3 months to process. My gut feeling tells me to accept this job offer (abroad) although I know that the company in the US has a better reputation. The problem with accepting the offer is that it means that I won't be able to prolong the trial period of the internship if it gives me a better opportunity and if I had promised the other company abroad that I would come in 2-3 months later. Knowing that I will accept this other opportunity, should I not proceed with the trial period that is being offered? I feel like this trial period would also be a good chance for me to know if this city is a good fit for me (I've just moved here from another state), as well as an opportunity to learn from such a great company. Another problem that makes me hesitant is because by accepting the offer abroad, they would proceed on paying for my visa sponsorship so there's no backing out if they did this already. Another option that I'm thinking of is asking to delay the start date of the abroad internship to 4 months later, so if I got offered to prolong the trial period to 2-3 months I would still be able to experience that. Would it be bad to inform the company that I would be on an internship in the US first? Would it be more appropriate if I tell them that I'm currently on another internship and would contact them in another month- 2 months if the opportunity is still available? For your information: I'm in the US as a foreigner, but currently holds an EAD card which allows me to work here for around a year. I've lived in the country where the other internship is offered for a year before as a student. 

I have an upcoming Skype interview with two directors of a company. If they don't give their e-mails to you after the interview, how would you send a thank you note or follow-up? Would sending a message in linkedin be a good way? Or would you normally just e-mail the person that you have a contact with and pass the thank you to them? 

In my years of experience as a US-based hiring manager, I always expect people to have references available when I ask for them. I don't need to see the references themselves on the resume. I don't need to see a phrase "References available upon request" on the resume. It's perfectly safe to leave them off. I would never assume that anyone has no references. Another reason for leaving them off of your resume is that you want to be in control of presenting your references. When asked to provide them, determine how many are necessary, and choose which references will best represent you for this particular position. Contact your references so they will expect a call or email from this company, and discuss the job with them so that they can represent you in the best possible light. Then give the list of references to the requester. In your locale, the norms may differ. 

That's not standard practice among any of the many companies where I have worked or any that I personally know. It seems unfair to me. But then lots of practices seem unfair to someone. But what does it matter if it is "standard" or "nonstandard"? Unless the laws in your locale prohibit this (and it doesn't seem like they do) or you already belong to a union (and I'm guessing you don't) you can: 

So the most likely option is that a counter-offer occurs. But not always. And you really can't know the outcome, unless you have a very good read on the situation before the offer is made. Go into salary negotiations with a clear understanding of how much you really want and how badly you want it, how much you really need, how much you are willing to settle for, and a best guess as to what the company might be willing to pay. That way, you'll be in the best negotiating position, and will know how to respond, no matter what the offer might be. 

Unfortunately, you don't. Stakeholders have specific needs that they can articulate, and generalized needs that they can't. When estimating a task, many include a certain percentage of time set aside to fix these sorts of unspecified issues. Once the primary change is made, general cleanup takes place and the result is an overall-better product that makes the stakeholders happy. You may need to enlist the help of your boss to prioritize the overall projects. But always include some cleanup time (or "technical debt" time). In addition, make sure you help keep a bug list up-to-date. That way, you can draw down the list as time allows. Pretty much every shop has a bit of "down time" here and there. A few quick bug fixes are great ways of filling in those time gaps. Having happy stakeholders should be your goal, rather than just fixing what they specifically point out. 

Burning would work. Of course, if you set off the smoke alarm it will be far more noisy than a shredder. And if you burn the building down you would have to work outside and listen to traffic going by - that could be noisy too. 

You may be right. Maybe he wants to count lines. Maybe he wants to check your capitalization style. Maybe he wants to see how well you comment. Maybe he wants to see if you follow the company's style guide. Maybe he wants to learn from your code. You don't really know and we clearly can't know. But no matter - that's his right anyway. You work for him. Trying to deny your boss access to code you write will certainly have negative repercussions on your job. If your manager really wants to get rid of you and hire his friend instead, he almost certainly doesn't need access to your code to do so.
