Provided two diagonal real matrix which has positive entries, $V$ and $U$. Find a real matrix $A$, satisfying $A^TA=a^2I$ for some scalar $a$, to minimise $\left|A^TVA-U\right|\quad\quad(*)$ where the matrix norm could be an induced one, or in form of $|M|^2_{F}=\mathrm{tr}(M^TM)$. I believe the problem is quite useful, however I am not sure where I can find the related materials. A numerical approach is also welcome. I found some related works , I think I can program the general framework for non-linear optimisation problem with unitary constraints. But since $(*)$ is only a quadratic form. I wonder if there are some improvements. remark: there are two trivial cases, namely $V=U$ or $U=I$. 

the question is: Given two riemann manifold, how to check almost isometry and estimate inf $ \{\varepsilon\}$ from spectrum data. 

Sorry, I misuse the concept of quasi-isometry, I mean almost isometry(also called a Hausdorff approximation). As we known, isometric Riemann manifolds have the same spectrum of Laplace-Beltrami. And it defined a class of isospectral manifolds which is a highly identical signature of manifold. However, in application, almost-isometry is more useful. Does anyone provide me an overview or reference of the relationship between spectrum and almost-isometry? Almost isometry say for two metric space(Riemann manifold). there exist $\varepsilon$ and $f: X\rightarrow Y$ s.t. 

Hi, I am interested in how to numerically track spectrum curves of a parameter dependent linear operator. Given a linear operator in square matrix form $M(t)$, where the matrix is smooth dependent of parameter $t\in[0,\infty]$. We also could know any order derivatives $M^{(k)}(t)$, whether analytic or not. Based on some perturbation theory, we may compute the derivatives of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of $M$ in theory. The main challenge is the treatment of repeated eigenvalues(or its derivatives). The general idea in literature, is to find a canonical form of eigenvectors $\{X_i\}$, such that $X_i$ is corresponding to the repeated eigenvalues of $M^{(0)},...,M^{(k-1)}$ and distinct eigenvalue of $M^{(k)}$. Thus the derivative of eigenvalue is given as $\lambda'_i = X^T_i M' X_i$ However, in numerical setting, non pair of eigenvalues are exactly the same, and the situation turn to be difficult when I would like to compute and observe the evolving of eigenvalues w.r.t parameter $t$ in its domain. For example, at $t=0$, suppose all eigenvalues are distinct. But during the $t$ evolves, the curves corresponding to distinct eigenvalue could intersect. I found it is still hard to handle the problem of numerical tracking, namely to find $n$ distinct smooth curves in $t$ domain which represent the spectrum of $M(t)$. Here are some basic ideas: In numerically sense if I have the eigenvalues $\lambda_{i}(t_j)$ and $\lambda_{i_q}(t_{j+1})$, $i=1,...,n$(the matrix dimension) for $t_{j+1} = t_j + \Delta t$(where $\Delta t$ should be reasonably small), computed by some standard numerical routines(such as the ones implemented in SLEPc), How could I figure out the permutation $i_p$ which indicates the correspondence between two consecutive group of eigenvalues. Since the standard routines for eigenvalue problem only solve a static matrix $M$, the eigenvectors computed does not have the canonical form described previously. By providing all eigenpairs of $M(t_j)$, $M(t_{j+1})$ and any derivatives of $M(t)$, is it possible to establish the eigenpair correspondence(maybe a probability sense in term of $\Delta t$). Or alternatively, by providing the eigenpairs of $M(t_j)$, is there a way to compute eigenpairs of $M(t_{j+1})$ in a sense to establish those correspondence implicitly. The problem is only challenged when two curves intersect(enough close at some $t$ comparing to $\Delta t$), otherwise I would simply assign the correspondence by comparing eigenvalues or inner product of eigenvectors of two consecutive eigen group. Due to my limited knowledge, I hope there are other people encountering the same problem, whether from theoretical interest or application background. All comments which may provide related informations are welcome. 

Let $H$ be a discrete hypergroup. Suppose I have a matrix $A=(A_{x,y})$ indexed over $H$ with nonnegative entries which defines a bounded operator on $\ell^2(H)$. When does there exist $f\in\ell^1(H)$ such that $A_{x,y}=\langle f*\delta_x,\delta_y\rangle$, i.e., $A$ is the matrix of transition probabilities for a random walk given by convolution with $f$? A necessary condition is that $A$ commutes with $\ell^1(H)$ convolution on the right. Is this sufficient? 

It depends on the conventions that you pick, but if you pick them correctly, you'll get what you want. First, for a normal linear functional $f$ on $B(H)$, there is a unique partial isometry $v\in B(H)$ and positive normal linear functional $|f|$ such that $f=v|f|$ and $v^*v$ is the support projection of $|f|$, where we use the convention that $v|f|(a) = |f|(av)$ for all $a\in B(H)$. See Theorem 4.3.2 of $URL$ for more details on this. Suppose $x\in B(H)$ is trace class, and consider the induced normal linear functional $f = \operatorname{Tr}(\,\cdot\,x)$ on $B(H)$. Now let's look at the polar decomposition of $x = u|x|$, which satisfies $\ker(u)=\ker(|x|)=\ker(x)$, so $u^*u$ is the support projection of $|x|$, and $u^*x=|x|$. Then $|x|$ induces a positive normal linear functional on $B(H)$, which we'll call $g$. One sees that for all $a\in B(H)$, \begin{align*} ug(a) &= g(au) = \operatorname{Tr}(au|x|)=\operatorname{Tr}(ax) = f(a) \\ u^*f(a) &= f(au^*) = \operatorname{Tr}(au^*x)=\operatorname{Tr}(a|x|) = g(a). \end{align*} Thus $ug = f$ and $u^*f = g$, so we see $$ g(a)=[u^*f](a)=[u^*(ug)](a)=[ug](au^*)=g(au^*u), $$ and $u^*u$ dominates the support projection of $g$. We easily verify that for all $b\in B(H)$, $$ g(b(1-u^*u))=\operatorname{Tr}(b(1-u^*u)|x|)=\operatorname{Tr}(b(|x|-u^*u|x|))=\operatorname{Tr}(b0)=0, $$ so $u^*u$ is exactly the support projection of $g$. This means that if $f=v|f|$ is the polar decomposition of $f$, then by the uniqueness of the polar decomposition, we must have that $|f|=g=\operatorname{Tr}(\,\cdot\,|x|)$ and $v=u$. 

Your answer will work, except if the $b_i$'s have trace zero as Theo points out. If the $b_i\in \mathcal{P}_{n_i}$ has trace zero, just use $1_{n_i}+b_i$ instead of $b_i$, where $1_{n_i}$ is $n_i$ parallel strands. Then you can cap this off to get a scalar as before. By what you remarked above, you'll be able to recover $1_{n_i}+b_i$, from which you can recover $b_i$ in the obvious way. The above technique is used in Kodiyalam and Tupurani (arXiv:1003.4577), where they show all finite depth subfactors are singly generated. A more interesting question would be to find the smallest depth at which such a planar algebra is singly generated. 

False. You can in the free abelian group generated by an apple and an orange. As Patrick Barrow says, "A failure of imagination is not an insight into necessity." 

I believe (1 and 2) and (3) are mutually exclusive. Here is a proof: First, the commensurator $$ Comm_G(H) = \{g\in G : |\mathcal{O} _{gH}|, |\mathcal{O} _{g^{-1}H}|<\infty\} $$ is a group. We will show: 

'automatically producing a bijection mapping one statistic to another' is demonstrated in Two statistics on the permutation group and Combinatorics problem related to Motzkin numbers with prize money I. 'automatically producing conjectures' is achieved by clicking on 'search for distribution' on any of the statistics in the statistics database. The result is a list of statistics that are conjecturally equidistributed with the given statistic, but where a map transforming the first into the second might not be known. A classic is $URL$ it is easy to write a script that iterates 2. to find a 'partner' for a given pair of equidistributed statistics. An example is given in the comments to $URL$ Note that this meanwhile has a proof, also (essentially) discovered by FindStat. a different kind of conjectures is provided by the list of 'experimental identities' found when selecting any of the maps at $URL$ I am guessing that not all identities at $URL$ are immediately obvious. I am also working on a new package that checks whether a statistic satisfying given constraints can possibly exist. But that's for later... 

This is (at least for now) a question out of curiosity, there is no "deeper" meaning to it I know of. In fact, my main question is: is the observation below obvious? To state the observation I have to define two statistics on permutations $|1|23:\mathfrak S_n\to \mathbb N$ and $|123:\mathfrak S_n\to \mathbb N$, and two maps, $K:\mathfrak S_n\to\mathfrak S_n$ and $S:\mathfrak S_n\to\mathfrak S_n$. Let $\pi$ be a permutation, then an occurrence of the vincular pattern $|1|23$ (warning: notations vary) is an occurrence of the ordinary pattern $123$ such that the first matched entries are the first two entries of the permutation. In other words the number of occurrences of $|1|23$ in $\pi$ is zero, if the $\pi(2) < \pi(1)$, and it is the number of entries larger than $\pi(2)$ otherwise. The statistic $URL$ counts the number of occurrences of $|1|23$ in $\pi$. Similarly, an occurrence of the vincular pattern $|123$ is an occurrence of the ordinary pattern $123$ such that the first matched entry is the first entry of the permutation. The statistic $URL$ counts the number of occurrences of $|123$ in $\pi$. Now, for the maps! Let $K$ be the inverse Kreweras complement $URL$ mapping $\pi$ to $(1,\dots,n)\pi^{-1}$, and let $S$ be the Simion-Schmitt $URL$ map, sending any permutation to a $123$ avoiding permutation (this is not a bijection!). Observation: 

Why would this be the case? A bijective argument (i.e., a bijection on $\mathfrak S_n$ sending $|1|23$ to $|123\circ K\circ S$) might be especially nice! Refinement: Let 

As mentioned in the comments, the FindStat project is aiming at what you want. Concerning the size: it contains currently about 1000 'combinatorial statistics', that is maps $s:\mathcal C_n\to \mathbb Z$ on some (graded) set of 'combinatorial' objects $\mathcal C_n$ and about 150 'combinatorial maps' between two collections. What makes FindStat powerful is the (trivial) ability to compose maps. For example, for Catalan objects we obtain about 1.500.000 a priori different statistics. Let me point out some possible ways of using it, in the spirit of the question. 

Probably what you really want is the fusion graph $\Gamma_X$ with respect to your simple object $X$. It is a directed graph with vertices labelled by the simple objects of your category. Between the vertices labelled by simples $Y$ and $Z$, there are $N^{Y,X}_Z=\operatorname{dim}(\operatorname{Hom}(Y\otimes X, Z))$ directed edges from $Y$ to $Z$. The fusion graph with respect to $X^*$ is obtained by reversing the orientation of all the edges, since by semisimplicity and Frobenius reciprocity, $$ N^{Y,X}_Z = \operatorname{dim}(\operatorname{Hom}(Y\otimes X, Z)) = \operatorname{dim}(\operatorname{Hom}(Y, Z\otimes X^*)) = \operatorname{dim}(\operatorname{Hom}(Z\otimes X^*, Y)) = N^{Y,X^*}_Z. $$ This means that if $X$ is self-dual, then you can view this graph as unoriented. In your question you've referred to a pair of unoriented graphs. These would arise if you were looking at the principal graphs of a subfactor. Given a finite index subfactor $A\subset B$, we have the semisimple tensor category of $A-A$ bimodules generated by $B$. The simples are obtained by decomposing the tensor powers $\bigotimes_A^n B$ into irreducibles. We can also view $\bigotimes_A^n B$ as an $A-B$ bimodule and decompose into irreducibles. This gives the semisimple module category of $A-B$ bimodules. Similarly, we have a tensor category of $B-B$ bimodules and a module category of $B-A$ bimodules. We get the principal graphs $(\Gamma_+,\Gamma_-)$ as follows. The graph $\Gamma_+$ has even vertices the simple $A-A$ bimodules and odd vertices the simple $A-B$ bimodules. There are then $\operatorname{dim}(\operatorname{Hom}_{A-B}(Y\otimes_A B, Z))$ edges between the simple $A-A$ bimodule $Y$ and the simple $A-B$ bimodule $Z$. The dual principal graph $\Gamma_-$ is defined analogously with $B-B$ and $B-A$ bimodules. Edit after the comments: Given a unitary fusion category $\mathcal{C}$ and an object $X\in\mathcal{C}$, you can construct a subfactor standard invariant $\mathcal{P}_\bullet$ from which you can get a pair of principal graphs $(\Gamma_+,\Gamma_-)$. First, you let \begin{align*} \mathcal{P}_{n,+} &= \operatorname{End}(\underbrace{X\otimes X^*\otimes \cdots \otimes X^\pm}_{n \text{ copies}}) \\ \mathcal{P}_{n,-} &= \operatorname{End}(\underbrace{X^*\otimes X\otimes \cdots \otimes X^\mp}_{n \text{ copies}}) \end{align*} where $X^\pm=X$ if $n$ is odd and $X^*$ if $n$ is even. Now the graph $\Gamma_+$ has even vertices the simple summands of objects of the form $(X\otimes X^*)^{\otimes n}$, and odd vertices the simple summands of objects of the form $(X\otimes X^*)^{\otimes n}\otimes X$. You get the edges similar to before, taking an even $Y$, tensoring with $X$, and decomposing into simples $Z$. The graph $\Gamma_-$ is defined similarly, but swapping the roles of $X$ and $X^*$. So that's the formal explanation of how you get the principal graphs, but there is a simpler way to compute $(\Gamma_+,\Gamma_-)$ based on the fusion coefficients $N^{Y,X}_Z$. As @Xiao-Gang points out in the comments, we can compute $\Gamma_+$ as the connected component containing $X$ in the bipartite graph with adjacency matrix $$ \begin{pmatrix} 0 & N^X \\ N^{X^*} & 0 \end{pmatrix} $$ where $N^X$ is the matrix of fusion coefficients for tensoring on the right by $X$, and similarly for $X^*$. The graph $\Gamma_-$ is then obtained by swapping the roles of $X$ and $X^*$. Interestingly, if $X\in \mathcal{C}$ is self-dual and the fusion graph $\Gamma_X$ in $\mathcal{C}$ is already bipartite (here, $\mathcal{C}$ is $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$-graded and $X$ is odd), then $(\Gamma_+,\Gamma_-) = (\Gamma_X, \Gamma_X)$. This occurs for many interesting examples.
