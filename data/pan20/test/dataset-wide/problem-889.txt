Use your plumb bob to ensure your stick is as close to vertical as you can make it. You'll want to place the stick in exactly the same place every day. The first thing you'll want to find is the north-south line that passes through the base of the stick. To do this, place a pebble at the tip of the stick's shadow when the shadow is at its shortest. If you do this perfectly, you'll have the north-south line on day number one. You almost certainly won't do this perfectly, so you'll need to repeat this for a few days. Because the Sun rises more or less in the east and sets in the west, you also know which way is north and which is south. You have a compass. You'll also have a very rough idea of your latitude. If the Sun sets to the left of the north-south line, you know you are somewhere north of 23.44 south latitude. If it sets to the right, you are south south of 23.44 north latitude. If you want a better idea of your latitude, keep doing this until the day you see the Sun rise exactly in the East. This happens twice a year, typically on March 20 and September 23. Use a string to measure the length of the stick's shadow when the tip of the shadow crosses the north-south line. You do not need a ruler; all you need to know is the ratio of the shadow's length to the stick's length. Now it's a matter of trigonometry: $$\phi = \arctan\left(\frac {\text{shadow length}}{\text{stick length}}\right)$$ 

The Perseids will not be the brightest in recorded human history. The fact-checking website snopes.com has this to say about this false claim: 

Small stars do not collapse to become supernovae. Our Sun, which is a not quite a small star, will not become a supernova. It will eventually become a red giant, shrink a bit, become a red giant again, and eventually become a white dwarf. In its end life it will go through some upheavals which will be rather minor compared to a supernova. This is the fate for stars between 1/2 of a solar mass and 8 or so solar masses. Stars smaller than 1/2 of a solar mass die extremely slowly, never even becoming a red giant. Only very large stars become supernova. The smaller ones leave neutron stars as remnants, the larger ones, black holes. A tiny fraction of the very largest stars are thought to bypass the supernova stage and directly collapse to become black holes. These failed supernovae form because those stars are so massive they collapse before they have consumed all of their fuel. 

A belated answer, but neither of the existing answers properly explain this. The proper explanation is simple. In Newtonian mechanics, tidal influences make all objects in retrograde orbits and those objects in prograde orbits below the equivalent of geosynchronous radius spiral inward. Only objects orbiting prograde above the equivalent of geosynchronous radius spiral outward. Our Moon orbits at about 385000 km, well above geosynchronous radius of 42164 km. Phobos orbits Mars with a semi-major axis of 9377 km, well below the areosynchronous radius of 20400 km. While our Moon is spiraling outward from Earth, Phobos is spiraling inward toward Mars. Mutually tidally locked objects spiral neither inward nor outward in Newtonian mechanics. General relativity modifies this dynamic a bit, making mutually tidally locked objects spiral inward. 

Because of an apparent language barrier, I'm not sure if the question is about the cause of the seasons or about the equation of time. To the questioner, do not make the mistake of assuming that conditions specific to Paris apply worldwide. It is now the time to go skiing in Chile, New Zealand, and Australia. While early July is the peak of summer in the northern hemisphere, it is the peak of winter in the southern hemisphere. Skiing fanatics with lots of disposable income take advantage of this fact and spend November to April in the northern hemisphere and then spend May to October in the southern hemisphere. The shape of the Earth's orbit has very little to do with the seasons. It is the Earth's axial tilt that drives the seasons. 

Addendum: Showing this is the same as the Astronomical Almanac expression, sans a quadratic term The Astronomical Almanac gives an expression for approximate mean sidereal time, in hours: $$\mathit{GMST} = 6.697374558 + 0.06570982441908 D_0 + 1.00273790935 H + 0.000026 T^2$$ Where $\mathit{GMST}$ is the mean sidereal time in hours, $H$ is the universal time at the time in question, $D_0$ is the Julian date on the previous midnight of the time in question less 2451545.0, $D$ is the Julian date at the time in question (including fractional days) less 2451545.0, and $T$ is $D/36525$. The relationship between $D_0$, $D$, and $H$ is quite simple: $D_0 = D - H/24$. Substituting this in the above and omitting the quadratic term yields $$\begin{aligned} \mathit{GMST} &= 6.697374558 + 0.06570982441908 (D-H/24) + 1.00273790935 H \\ &= 6.697374558 + 0.06570982441908D + H \end{aligned}$$ (Strictly speaking, 1.00273790935-0.06570982441908/24 = 0.9999999999992 rather than 1.0, but that's just because that 1.00273790935 should be 1.0027379093508). Multiplying by 15 yields the GMST in degrees: $$\mathit{GMST}_{\text{deg}} = 100.4606184 + 0.9856473662862 D + 15 H$$ This is the expression in the question, sans the longitude and plus some extra digits. 

To put this in perspective, consider a fifty-plus year old human whose main source of exercise for the last twenty-plus years has been walking back and forth between work and the parking spot where the person parks his or her car. Let's strap that person to a bicycle connected to a generator. The energy output of that feeble source of energy easily exceeds the feeble 200 watt gravitational waves produced by the Earth's orbit about the Sun. Gravitation is extremely feeble compared to electromagnetism. The electrostatic repulsion between a pair of electrons is 1045 times stronger than is the gravitation attraction between a pair of electrons. Gravitational waves are in turn extremely feeble compared to gravitation itself. I mentioned the Earth's orbit about the Sun. The total mechanical energy of that orbit is about 1034 times greater than the paltry amount of energy lost due to gravitational waves. Imagine a Kardashev level III civilization, a civilization that has learned to harness the equivalent of the energy output of an entire galaxy. Aside: Humanity isn't even at Kardashev level I. That's another few hundred years in the future. Also note that the Kardashev scale is logarithmic. Karadshev level I is near future science fiction. Kardashev level II is also in the realm of science fiction. Kardashev level III? That's beyond science fiction. Even that Kardashev level III civilization would not harness gravitational waves. It would instead go out of their way to avoid them. A Kardashev level III civilization might, for example, intentionally feed matter to a supermassive black hole at the heart of a galaxy to make that black hole become an active galactic nucleus. The energy output of an AGN is immense, exceeding that of a normal galaxy. The gravitational waves produced by an AGN are minuscule compared to the electromagnetic output, by a factor of about 10-80 or so. 

Our galaxy is a member of the Local Group, which in turn is a member of the Virgo Supercluster, which in turn is a part of the Laniakea Supercluster. Even larger scale objects include galaxy filaments. And that's where the hierarchy ends. The expansion of space overtakes gravity at such immense distances. 

Keplerian orbital elements work quite nicely in the case of two point masses, or more generally, two objects with a spherical mass distribution. The anomaly is the only Keplerian orbital element that changes over time. Keplerian elements can be used in situations where the underlying assumptions are approximately correct by developing a model of how those supposedly unchanging elements vary with time. One way of doing this is to use Lagrange's planetary equations. (There are other related approaches such as Gauss' planetary equations, Delaunay's planetary equations, etc.) Lagrange's planetary equations yield expressions for how Keplerian orbital elements vary over time given a set of perturbing forces. Another approach is to use something akin to those Keplerian elements such as Delaunay elements), coupled with planetary equations for those alternative elements. Yet another approach is to use orbital elements (e.g., Brouwer-Lyddane elements, SGP4 elements) in which the planetary equations are embedded in the orbital element to Cartesian state transformation algorithm. This final approach is used to this day to describe vehicles in Earth orbit. 

Ignoring the minute possibility of something like a neutron star colliding with our Sun sometime during the next few billion years, yes, it's an inevitability. There's some debate about borderline cases such as low metallicity stars ("metal" to an astronomer means anything but hydrogen or helium), and low or high mass stars. Our Sun does not fall into these borderline cases. 

The second statement is correct. The axial tilt is the primary driver of the seasons. The first statement is not exactly correct. There is a small but persistent change in the orientation of the Earth's axis. The change over the course of a year is small. The change over the course of 13,000 years is large. In 13,000 years the Earth's axis will be tilted by about 47 degrees compared to the current orientation. In yet another 13,000 years the Earth will be oriented very similarly to how it is oriented now. I'll write more about this later.
