Stars in the Milky Way orbit the Milky Way because of all of the mass that comprises the Milky Way. That other stuff includes stars, other ordinary matter such as gas clouds, and perhaps dark matter. I used "perhaps" because dark matter has not yet been confirmed. General relativity does not explain the orbits of stars about a galaxy with the assumption that the only form of mass is ordinary matter. This leads to two possibilities: Either general relativity (and by extension, Newtonian gravity) is somehow wrong at galactic scales, or mass comes in flavors other than ordinary matter. The former leads to alternative formulations of gravitation such as MOND. The latter leads to alternative forms of mass such as dark matter. Even though the existence of dark matter is yet to be confirmed, the vast majority of astrophysicists lean toward the latter assumption, that ordinary matter is not the only form of matter. 

The number 18.697374558 was the value of GMST (in hours) at noon UT on 1 January, 2000. The number 24.06570982441908 reflects the fact that it takes slightly less than 24 hours (23.934469591898 hours to be precise) for a star to the appear to rotate by 360 degrees. This is a consequence of the fact that the Earth orbits the Sun. Our 24 hour day is based on the time between two consecutive solar noons. Because the Earth moves a bit along its orbit, the Earth has to rotate by more than 360 degrees (with respect to the stars) to see the Sun rotate by 360 degrees. Another way to look at it: The 23.934469591898 hour long sidereal day means that a solar day is 24.06570982441908 hours long expressed in sidereal hours. 

Given sufficiently accurate measurements, the Moon's weird composition forms an excellent basis for testing both the various forms of the equivalence principle. The Moon's far side has a much thicker crust than does its near side. This makes for a two kilometer offset between the Moon's center of mass and center of figure. The thick crust on the far side (mostly silicon, oxygen, and aluminum) the offset core on the near side (mostly iron and nickel) would subtly affect the Moon's orbit if weak form of the equivalence principle didn't apply. In fact, the Moon's orbit as measured by lunar laser ranging experiments provides an excellent basis for testing even the strong equivalence principle. Note that Newtonian mechanics disagrees with all but the Galilean equivalence principle. Newtonian mechanics also fails to match the observed orbit of Mercury, and to a lesser extent, the observed orbit of the Moon. Viable alternatives to general relativity agree with the weak form of the equivalence principle, and most agree with the Einstein form of the equivalence principle. General relativity is consistent with the strong equivalence principle (as are a very small number of alternatives to general relativity). 

Yes. The JPL HORIZONS on-line solar system data and ephemeris computation service provides these values, and much more. 

That's a bad assumption. He undoubtably meant something else. Even Kepler knew the Moon's orbit about the Earth was not Keplerian. Newton tried to explain this non-Keplerian behavior in terms of perturbations from the Sun. He did manage to explain some of the key lunar anomalies, but the math of his time was not quite up to the challenge. The full Newtonian explanation would have to wait a couple of hundred years, culminating in the work of Ernest William Brown. To develop his (classical) lunar theory, Brown had to account for gravitational perturbations from a number of different objects: The Sun, Venus, Jupiter (and to a lesser extent, the other planets), and also the non-spherical nature of the Earth's and the Moon's gravity fields. Even with that, Brown had to introduce a fudge factor to account for a 10 arc second fluctuation in the Moon's angular position. It turned out that the need for this fudge was the transfer of angular momentum from the Earth's rotation to the Earth's orbit. This slows down the Earth's rotation rate (making time based on the the Earth's rotation a less than stellar idea) and makes the Moon recede from the Earth. Brown eventually added these concepts to his lunar theory. Brown's student Wallace J. Eckert later extended Brown's lunar theory. Eckert was the first person to apply digital computers (as opposed to human computers) to the problem of predicting the Moon's orbit. He was also the person who developed the lunar ephemerides used by the Apollo program. Eckert's work was still classical as opposed to relativistic. The retroreflectors placed on the Moon by the U.S. and the Soviet Union during the 1960s and 1970s finally necessitated the use of general relativity to explain the Moon's orbit. The effects are extremely subtle, but they are there. In particular, those retroreflectors serve as one of the highest precision tests of a key precept of general relativity, the strong equivalence principle. The equivalence principle comes in a number of forms: 

The very first stage of planet formation involves purely inelastic (i.e., sticky) collisions between pairs of small particles of dust to make slightly larger particles of dust, pairwise collisions between these slightly larger particles to make even larger particles, and so on. So far, the only gravitation that comes into play is that of the central protostar and the disk as a whole. The gravitation of these little objects is very small. Then some magic happens that makes the little rocks that result from this very first stage grow into planetesimals that do gravitate. How do little rocks (a few centimeters in diameter) grow into little planetesimals (a few hundred meters in diameter)? This is the key open problem in the theory of planet formation. The core of the problem is that objects the size of a spec of dust to an object the size of a small pebble move with the gas that forms the bulk of the disk. The outward pressure from the gas in the disk makes the gas and small objects move at a slightly less than orbital speed. Once an object reaches the centimeter scale or so, the pressure from the gas no longer provides the support needed to keep those objects moving at that slightly suborbital speed. The objects start to become separated from the gas. By the time an object reaches a meter or so in diameter, the gas is equivalent to a hurricane force headwind. One consequence of this is that collisions become ever more violent as objects grow beyond a centimeter in size, and hence are more likely to break colliding objects apart than to make them coalesce. An even bigger problem is that that headwind makes centimeter- to meter-sized objects spiral into the protostar, and very quickly (a few hundred years from 1 AU). A number of proposals have been put forth to overcome this meter barrier problem. So far, none appears to have stuck. (Sorry for the pun.) Once objects reach some critical size, the drag from the gas reduces in importance thanks to the square-cube law and the gravitational attraction increases. That critical size varies from hundreds of meters to tens of kilometers, depending on which paper one reads (experts vary). These objects are "planetesimals," and there are lots of them. These once again combine readily to make planetary embryos. From then on, its just a mopping up process as gravitation either makes these planetesimals / planetary embryos combine or ejects them from the star system. 

The technical name (in English) for the Sun is not Sol, which is just Latin for sun. The technical name for the Sun is the Sun. Another body in the sky has a similarly boring name, the Moon. There's one more boringly named object: in the Solar System: The Earth. Note the use of "the" (a definite article) and the use of capitalization to indicate a specific object. The problem with Sun, Moon, and Earth is that we have been using these names (or their predecessors) for thousands of years. For example, sun, sol, ἥλιος (helios), and a bunch of other names for that very bright object in the sky whose presence distinguishes day from night all derive from the same proto-Indo-European word sóh₂wl̥.

The 2017 Perseid shower won't even be as "bright" as it was last year, let alone in recorded history. Per NASA, the peak hourly rate in 2017 will be about 80% of the peak 2016 rate. Making matters worse, the 2017 shower will be obscured by the Moon. The 2016 rate wasn't the best show in recorded history, either, or even in recent history. The latter honor ("best show in recent history") goes to the 1993 Perseid shower, which occurred a year after the parent comet Swift-Tuttle made a close approach to the Earth. By recent, I mean quite recent. The showers centered around the year 1862 were probably even better than those around 1992. Meteor showers result from the Earth intersecting the debris trail left behind by a comet. This debris trail is distributed along the comet's orbit, but the distribution is not uniform. The peak concentration in general is close to the comet itself. The distance between the Earth and the comet when the Earth comes closest to the comet's orbit has been increasing since 1992, making the intensity of the Perseid shower decrease rather than increase. The comet will make a very close approach in 2126, resulting in some nice shows for our children's children's children.
