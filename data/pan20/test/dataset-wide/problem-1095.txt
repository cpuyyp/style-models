You're correct about how the VLFs grow in size. Check out the following video from Jes Borland for some more tidbits. How SQL Server Works: Log File (Video) 

I have a few databases in which the frontend application manages certain maintenance tasks. In this particular instance, I'm running the INDEX OPTIMIZE job every night and every so often it clashes with the application and fails. The following is the error that I receive: 

Or will I have to break the mirror, restore the database, then rebuild the mirror? We're in the process of upgrading our SharePoint servers. We already have two new servers in place and they are currently mirrored. If possible, I'd like to leave the servers in a mirrored state to save time during our maintenance window. 

I find it hard to believe that there aren't better native tools to filter SQL Server Error Logs. Even Windows Logs have better filtering capabilities. I'd like the ability to remove certain events from the results or a list of events from the results or to be able to search for a very specific error/event. 

We restore a database daily that we download from an FTP site. I would like to build a history table that tracks when the database is restored on our SQL Server. This is easy. My issue is sometime the download is incomplete and therefore the restore does not work and throws an error. I would like to add logic to my history process to insert failed if the restore fails. Not sure how to handle this logic and am looking for assistance. This is the error we get most frequently when the failure occurs. 

I am trying to track down the root cause of this issue I keep seeing. We have SSRS running with a custom URL like $URL$ When I connect to that address I can login and see reports. If I progress to a report and click manage I get the report detail and the list of properties on the side screen. Now if I click on data source it gives me a failure to load page and I notice that the URL in the address bar is $URL$ . If I put an "s" in that URL the page loads. I am trying to figure out how I can fix this. Any ideas would be helpful. SSRS 2008 R2 enterprise edition 

I wonder if this question will need to be moved to the SharePoint SE site, but I believe this could be a simple a SQL Server security fix. A little back story: Back in April we upgraded our SharePoint SQL Server backend (mirrored) from SQL 2005 to SQL 2014. We did this by way of mirroring from SQL 2005 (primary) to SQL 2014 (mirror). I don't believe the security settings and logins were extracted from the old server and placed in the new. I'll have to reach out to my infrastructure department to see if the server has been completely decommissioned. My SharePoint Admin is trying to create a new site from the SharePoint Central Admin Site (SharePoint 2010), but gets the following error. 

Having 10s of thousands of error messages per week makes it pretty difficult to peruse and check other possible issues 

This server was recently installed and configured. I was in the process of creating some maintenance plans to backup the logs and DBs on a daily basis. Regardless of my method to perform a full backup, it would fail immediately citing the generic error message 

We are working a data center migration and are to the SSRS boxes and I am having trouble. SSRS is installed on a server alone pointing to the ReportServer and ReportServerTempDB on a different SQL Engine. We migrated the SSRS server to a new data center last night and removed from old domain and added to new domain. I have installed SQL Engine on the SSRS server itself and restored the ReportServer and ReportServerTempDB from the old SQL Engine location in the old data center. My issue is I cannot get the SSRS service to start as I believe it is trying to use a service account that is in a domain it cannot see anymore and a ReportServer database it no longer can access. My question is, can I somehow change the pointer for the service account being used and the pointer to the SQL Engine being used. The Report Services Manager GUI only gives me an option to change service account and everything else is greyed out. I changed the service account there, but the service will still not start. Any ideas will be helpful. 

Another option to consider if you don't want to impact the connection between the log shipping servers during production hours is to use Distributed File System (DFS). You will still need a log shipping secondary in Korea, but you will disable the copy jobs for all the databases on the log shipping secondary. All you have is the backup job running on the log shipping primary and the restore job on log shipping secondary in Korea. DFS provides you a lot of flexibility to throttle bandwidth during production hours and then increase during off-hours. Essentially, DFS would copy all your .trn files directly from the log shipping primary to the log shipping secondary in Korea. 

We use Quest Spotlight for database server monitoring. Depending on when SQL server decides to fail over automatically, we will get an alert stating that a database has not been backed up in over three days (the factory default) if that server has not been primary in over 72 hours. My suspicion is that SQL Server does NOT replicate this data, but I wanted to hear from the community since a quick Google search didn't provide anything. Plus, I am travelling and do not have time to test and I need to provide a fairly immediate response. 

I am looking for some assistance with this code. This code builds the proper command line syntax and executes fine. However, when running via TSQL I get Incorrect Syntax near '/'. 

My company is currently going through a data center migration. We are now down to the SQL Servers and this includes SSRS. The bad thing that is going to hit us is the current SSRS server is being migrated to a new domain. So all users/groups that have access to SSRS are in DomainA and after the migration the SSRS server will be in DomainB. All user and groups were migrated from DomainA to DomainB, supposidly using the preserve SIDs. During a test we could not get this to work. So DomainA\User1 does not work when server is changed to DomainB. We have over 70,000 combinations of user permissions and group permissions across all of our reports. Does anyone have any suggestions or ideas on how we can properly migrate this server from DomainA to DomainB without having to manually duplicate the security settings. Note: This is a virtual machine and is being replicated from one VMWare cluster to one on the new network and then will be dis-joined from DomainA and joined to DomainB. Service accounts will be changed to DomainB and backup of encryption key will be restored after service account is changed. 

I'm migrating some TSQL code from one server to another. The server I'm moving it from is production, so I'm not easily able to adjust settings for obvious reasons. The code runs fine on the production server, but the firewall is off, we don't desire this configuration and want the firewall enabled on the new server. How can I leverage Extended Events to tell me which ports are being used during TSQL code execution? Or do I need to use something like WireShark?

Everything in the result set was correct, save monitor_server, it had the value of OddServer03! As many of you know, when configuring Log Shipping through the GUI, it is damn near impossible to "accidentally" configure this option. We never intended having a monitor server in the mix. We use Quest Spotlight to monitor the aforementioned servers which will yield alerts when jobs fail or when log shipping gets behind. One other perplexing matter, the job that is getting created is instead of . Why is the service account trying to authenticate to a server that isn't part of the configuration? 

I have recently automated the SQL patching of ~200 development servers. Currently we have 6 servers that run the Microsoft Master Data Services feature. After a SQL patch is applied there is a manual step to go in and open Master Data Services Configuration Manager and do an upgrade of the schema. Since this kills my automation for those 6 servers I am trying to find out if there is a programmatic way to run this upgrade process after applying the SQL patch. 

We are trying to determine our best MAXDOP and Cost Threshold settings for an EDW box. I setup a job to clear the wait stats before the build started and then capture the wait stats after the build was complete. Our server is Windows 2008 and SQL 2008 Enterprise. (Yeah I know, it is are oldest box and we are working on that). There are 8 CPU and 132GB of memory for the box and 118GB max memory for SQL. The wait stats after the run are below. Would you tweak cost threshold (Current 50) or change maxdop (Current 4).
