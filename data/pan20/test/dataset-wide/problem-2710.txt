One reply from Buddhism, which Krishnamurti would no doubt have been aware of, is that thought does not need to act. 

(The Postcard, 1987, pages 404-405) My comments are echoed in Robert Trumbull PhD dissertation, online here: Derrida, Freud, Lacan: Resistances 

However, with special relativity, the velocity of the observers means that the meaning of before and after is altered, and so the concept of time is altered (from Aristotle's definition). $URL$ 

In Jacques Derrida's 1982 book Margins of Philosophy there is an essay (apparently written in 1968) called "The Pit and the Pyramid: Introduction to Hegel's Semiology", which is a very lucid summary of Hegel's Phenomenology of Spirit. 

As I understand it, time was historically defined as dependent on motion. Then fine measures were defined. Nevertheless, motion still defines time, so for instance, two particles moving relative to each other in the present are all that is required for time to flow. The intertia of the particles keeps time flowing, but the particles are always (present) in the present. 

So in my loose understanding, existential beings transcend the extant being of their component material (which is the ontological difference), and as a property of transcendence they (or somatic bodies in general) need to operate according to reason (or rationality), and it is this principle that is the ground. 

So distant events in the present are unobservable, but the present still exists. Just because we cannot see these distant events in the present does not mean their temporal simultaneity is disrupted one iota. The only way modern, post-relativistic presentism is broken is by time-travel, which is highly speculative at best. In the example below the past and the present coexist, which contradicts modern presentism. $URL$ 

You can find a nondual, philosophical treatment of spirituality and religion in Jacques Derrida's 'Of Spirit' and 'Acts of Religion', particularly in the latter's essay 'Hospitality'. As an aside, note the connection between hospitality (hospitable), host, guest and ghost (latin spirit), all mentioned in these books. Re. ghost - Gæst in Beowulf (old English) 

"I always think negative about future events in advance and live in extreme fear. How to stop this permanently." Guatama Buddha figured this out two and a half thousand years ago. You should understand how to practise detachment, calm yourself down, and gain equanimity. Once you're calm you can carry on with all the necessities of life as before, minus the worry and the worry-induced mistakes. Detachment goes like this: I'm worried about nuclear war. Hang on, I'm here by accident; the world is not my responsibility. Now I'm calm I'll take care of the world anyway! Contemplations on Love, Compassion, Sympathetic Joy and Equanimity 

So perhaps to be too literal in seeking a standard and precise definition is to be misled by language. For instance there is ambiguity in the definition of "universe", where people go on to speak of multiverse. Other concepts similarly depend on various conceptual world views or (universe views). 

I use the Perseus Project for looking up Heidegger's greek quotations. It has greek and english word search, and paragraph-by-paragraph translations for many of the texts Heidegger quotes from. Very useful. $URL$ Example screen-shot :- 

... who, in metaphorical or real sense, just wishes us to be our best selves. There's meaning. Perhaps the existentialists are rejecting some other meaning. If they are rejecting all meaning then their position is paradoxical, because they are trying to make sense and meaninglessness simultaneously. 

Care is the focal point of being because without taking care, being careful, nothing can be done. Without taking care to organise thoughts one cannot think. At the cellular level, if the cells of a plant aren't careful in their functioning the plant cannot grow properly. It's a scalable concept, (my interpretation). 

The best way to see what's going on is to read carefully the climate sceptics' positions and the rebuttals. Often the sceptics' presentations are so poor it becomes obvious on which side the weight of evidence is stacked. Edit A case in point: "How climate change deniers’ lies made a leading sceptic change sides" 

Hopefully the following will give you some food for thought. In brief, and somewhat loosely, for the greeks essence preceded existence, but the romans turned it around :- n.b. eidos = form or essence 

Dr. Trigant Burrow (1875 - 1950) wrote in Preconscious Foundations that the language followed after consciousness and caused quite a few problems. His theory is that early consciousness was holistic/unified but later and quite recently, in terms of evolutionary time, language came along and profoundly confused people and society. The main problem seems to be the tendency for literalism, but more mendacious tricks and methods of social control are not beyond suspicion. The solution sounds a lot like buddhism: consciously detaching from views and thinking/being without language/mentation. 

Synchronicity or mysticism is hardly mentioned in respectable philosophy. A recent mention in psychology (quoted below) throws some light, and Stanislav Grof writes interestingly about it. Synchronicity and mysticism seem to be a better subject fit for psychology than analytical philosophy. It's such a different paradigm, akin to speculating that reality is plastic on a fundamental level. The impenetrability of the Ding an such (thing-in-itself) would disappear, but experience of synchronicity merely suggests that it might be permeable. Stanley Schneider's essay 'The Mystical and Spiritual in the Large Group' can be read online here:- $URL$ 

The Being Heidegger writes of before 'the turn' (die Kehre) eventually comes under erasure. The conclusion, it seems, is that Being is unlike anything one can ordinarily conceived of. Die Kehre 

By way of preable to answering I'll quote Robert Trumbull's PhD dissertation, online here: Derrida, Freud, Lacan: Resistances 

So when Galileo said the Earth revolves around the Sun he was being rational and immoral. What this means is you have to be careful about being rational. 

If we take God as the superessential essence; the purest essence which has no predicates and therefore serves as its own existence, as formally formulated. And furthermore, having no predicates is therefore without a flaw and is perfect. This perfect being can create the universe by allowing it to be. Fiat lux. 

Whether things you can't interact with can exist depends on your definition of existence. If existence depends on perception, as debated here: Debate.Org: Is existence based upon perception?, then the tumbling dust and possible magical kingdoms outside the observable universe exist, for you, only as probable, unknown somethings beyond the observable universe. If a magical elf lives there in a magical kingdom, then the elf's perception discriminates a kingdom from the inevitable space dust, (which is effectively nothingness). That discrimination, differentiation, perception makes existence is illustrated in the tale of The Prince & The Pauper, where pauper thinks the prince's seal is a nutcracker. Perception and interaction with an object at-hand combine to turn an abstract concept (essentia) into an actual nutcracker, not that the prince would agree that the correct concept has been reified. From Heidegger: The Thomistic doctrine of the distinctio realis between essentia and existentia in ente creato (The Basic Problems of Phenomenology, page 91) 

It would be in line with Nietzsche's aesthetic to say "why write a lecture when you can write a work of art." But that's not to say he used literature as a vehicle to explain the inexplicable. Rather he just chose to elevate it to a higher form. 

source - $URL$ So inasmuch as literary criticism and philosophy are different contexts one might suppose the phrase could be taken and developed differently. However, the original context is Derridean and quite specific. By observing as far as possible the source the original meaning is protected. Where it is taken next, or whether it is deconstructed in situ, is something further. Of Grammatology, page 158 - $URL$ 

The difference between things that can't be interacted with, such as space dust beyond the observable universe, and things that don't exist, is that you can reason that there is space dust beyond the observable universe. You can perceive there is matter there because the limit of observable light has nothing to do with matter. As for things like "future inventions" or "unknown things", which you supposedly can't interact with. Well they exist for you as members of the set of future inventions, or unknown things, and you have interacted with them on this minimal cognitive level. 

This is very much the subject of Derrida's book Aporias. As the filaments of consciousness or being disintegrate can there be any moment at which being stops. Indeed, how can one not be, or transition from an existing Being to a non-existing non-Being, (since the being cannot do non-being). The orthodox analysis of being has to accept unfamiliar gradations of being which might be stepped through in order to handle this novel subject area between being and non-being -- the aporia of death. 

The OP asks: "Is it correct to say that Hawkings & Mlodinows world emerge from nothing? They must presumably posit some physical law that enabled this something to come out of nothing, and this law cannot be in time as space-time also came out of nothing." Why should time not begin? We would normally say that time requires something to be in motion to give a measure of time, so when the first moving phenomenon appears, time begins. More interesting is the question of nothing. Is empty space-time just space or absolute nothing, or are they the same? I would side with Sir Roger Penrose [1] who holds that prior to the Big Bang the universe was in a different state. Nothing in motion, so no time, but not absolute nothing. (BTW I particularly like the Gas in a Box part of his lecture.) Turning back to the subject of absolute nothing. This is considered by some to be a simply a concept, since nothing cannot exist However, under the doctrine of essentia and existentia, whereas regular essences need their actuality to be caused in order exist, nothing can be considered as a special case that does not need its actuality to be caused in order to exist. That was the case in medieval mysticism [2]. 

However, this is a philosophical nonsense because you would have to have an established concept of deity in order to assert that it does not exist. If the assertion is that the concept of deity is without standard or meaningful definition then you could qualify the position as "conceptual atheism" : the position that there is no workable definition of deity. Likewise, if the issue (as stated in the title) is "skepticism* about whether a concept is meaningful", then this could be "conceptual agnosticism". * Skepticism, as in "refraining from making truth claims". In matters of specific definition, it is worth noting that the Catholic encyclopedia is somewhat flexible about the existential definition of the essence of God, allowing for different philosophical world views :- 

Because of the logical non-existence of Nothing, as user24828 says, we should consider that something/existence has always existed. However, since it is undiscriminated space-dust and formations, it is itself, as Albert Camus puts it, "everlasting nothingness": 

The greek word for nature, physis (ϕύσις), was defined by Aristotle as "a kind of being (ούςία). Specifically ... the production of itself, from out of itself, unto itself." So, in this manner of speaking, the universe is creating itself all the time. Reference quotation:- 

Regarding the transcendental determination of the idea of 'everything' - e.g. 'the universe' - all predicates are possible to it: i.e. "all things are possible". Once existence comes into play specific possibilities are crystalised and mutually exclusive ones disappear - they are no longer possibilities. This transcendental concept is laid out in Immanuel Kant's Critique of Pure Reason:- Ch. III. Section ii. Of the Transcendental Ideal (Prototypon Trancendentale). 

The advent of Post-truth has a high correlation with the recent rise in right-wing populism, so here is some writing on right-wing authoritarianism (RWA) research that casts a light on why followers don't do such a great job reasoning or relating to the truth. Free PDF: The Authoritarians (2006) by Prof. R. Altemeyer e.g. Chapter 3: How Authoritarian Followers Think (page 75) 

However, in its origin, and still to a large extent today, I would say, left and right relate to the social authoritarian-liberal spectrum. In the French Revolution the right were the authority loyalists and the left were the ones with new ideas. There was also a respective dimension of wealth preservation and wealth redistribution though. Wikipedia: Left-right politics 

The undiscovered rock on Pluto can be said to exist in the set of "undiscovered things". Obviously the rock specifically (and perhaps other things on Pluto) cannot be known, but the set of "undiscovered things" is a tangible, objective 'thing'. (You can go and discover something from it.) This topic reminds me of Heidegger's consideration of the necessary, anterior material basis for Being, which cannot be observed but can be reasonably deduced, (as I hazily recall). 

This mystical theology appears to be saying, (amongst other things), that the essence of nothing does not require production to become actual. For example, whereas the concept (res essentia) of any other thing, such as a table, requires the making of the thing to become an actual thing (res existentia), 'nothing' does not require anything further to reify its concept. It uniquely qualifies as actual nothing by itself. 

I tend to agree. My unemphatic opinion is that nonexistence (the 'existence' of nothing) is precluded by existence (of something), and that the case does not change - whether across cyclical Big Bangs or other forms of existence. The most obvious logical contradiction appears to be the proposition that something could come from nothing.
