Presumably you discovered my book Practical Foundations of Mathematics and wrote your very flattering private email to me after asking this question and then forgot to update it. Coincidentally, Andrej Bauer commented on substitution as pullback on his blog and I posted a brief description of my construction there. 

By the Yoneda embedding, any category is a full subcategory of its category of presheaves. For this to be valid, the collection of objects of the category has to be a set. So if you enlarge the universe to make this the case then you can make any category concrete. That being said, I "don't believe in" (the usefulness of) any of this terminology, either the vocabulary associated with "sets" or that of "concrete" categories. 

Why on Earth do you feel the need to coerce Conway's system into some form of Set Theory? Please go and read the Appendix to Part Zero of On Numbers and Games, which is a manifesto for the Mathematician's Lib Movement. Conway's games are already formulated in much the same way as set theories are, the only difference being that they have left- and right-handed members. Why do you think that an official one-handed set theory is any more suitable as a foundation than Conway's system free-standing? Anyway, if you have coerced it into your preferred set theory, it becomes useless for anybody else's. For example, Mike Shulman recently solved the problem of eliminating the double negations from every level, as part of the presentation of Conway Numbers in Homotopy Type Theory (in the final chapter of the book). 

As Mike Shulman says, an arrow with a stroke through it (either orthogonally or obliquely) is a common notation for relations. However, I don't see any logic in this choice of symbol: it ought to reflect the symmetry of the situation. I use an arrow with two half arrowheads on it. I am not aware of any TeX symbol font that contains this, but it can be drawn using the following macro: 

described a computable endofunction of the square. The classical Brouwer thereom says that it has a fixed point, but no such fixed point can be defined by a program. This is in contrast to the classical response to the constructive IVT, that either there is a computable zero, or the function hovers at zero over an interval. (I have not yet managed to incorporate Baigger's counterexample into my thinking.) Returning to ${\bf R}^1$, we have a lamentable failure of classical and contructive mathematicians to engage in a meaningful debate. The former claim that the result in full generality is "obvious", and argue by 

Just as I said that an arithmetic universe is set theory for computation, so I claim that my programme Abstract Stone Duality is its general topology. To study Wouter's second question we need to consider partial functions and in particular subobjects, which we expect to be recursively enumerable. It is natural to consider these to be the open subspaces. ASD extends AU by allowing us to consider the topology (lattice of open or RE subspaces) of an object $X$ as another first class object. This is the exponential $\Sigma^X$, where $\Sigma$ is thought of as the Sierpinski space. The object $\Sigma$ carries its own structure, in particular that of a distributive lattice The language is presented in Sections 4 and 5 of my paper on The Dedekind Reals in ASD with Andrej Bauer. In this setting, we take the overt discrete object $X$ as our "sets"; these have $\exists_X:\Sigma^X\to\Sigma$ and $=_X:X\times X\to\Sigma$. The full subcategory of overt discrete objects is a pretopos and has free monoids. Conversely, any arithmetic universe can be embedded as the full subcategory of overt discrete objects in a model of ASD. To answer Wouter's second question we need to show how general recursion can be interpreted in ASD and conversely that ASD terms can be normalised. The minimalisation operator $\mu$ takes a partial function $f:N\rightharpoonup 2$ and (possibly) returns the first $n$ for which $f(n)=1$. Partial functions may be rendered total using the lift constructor and then $\mu:(2_\bot)^N\to N_\bot$. For the converse, given a term $\vdash\phi:\Sigma^N$ with $\vdash(\exists n.\phi n)=\top$, we must find a term $\vdash a:N$ with $\vdash(\phi a)=\top$. This is (the special case for ASD of) the existence theorem. I should stress that ASD is not functional programming: there is no preferred reduction strategy. It is more like logic programming. Fran√ßois will no doubt regard the state of the documentation of these results as a "mess". The classical model of ASD is the category of locally compact spaces, which is rather short of good categorical structure. Of course, it is the purpose of ASD to rectify this. The technology for cooking up objects of the category, and in particular for giving their recipes in a simple fashion, is still very much under development and has already gone through several versions. The first version was the abstract formulation of Stone duality that the adjunction $\Sigma^-\dashv\Sigma^-$ be monadic, which led to a structure that I called a nucleus. My construction of the free monoid was a domain-theoretic tour de force in the manipulation of nuclei. If I (had had enough brain-space left and) had thought properly about the stability issue, I believe that I could have used a version of Milly's subsequent idea to prove this using the tools that I had developed in that paper. At about the same time I was working on computable bases for locally compact spaces, which are rather easier to use than nuclei. I am currently trying to simplify that method with a view to proving a Kleene normal form for ASD terms (of general types) and thereby making the calculus more amenable to computation. All of this ground to a halt became both of my parents had (different kinds of) dementia, but following their death I hope to get back to work this year. 

For anyone other than Chris Townsend or Steve Vickers, I think it is simpler just to ask about the forgetful and free functors $\mathbf{Frm}\rightleftarrows\mathbf{Dcpo}$ between the categories of frames and directed complete partial orders. Not altogether surprisingly, $\mathbf{Frm}$ is the category of algebras for the monad over $\mathbf{Dcpo}$. There is a general question for any adjunction $\mathcal{C}\rightleftarrows\mathcal{D}$: Suppose we replace $\mathcal C$ by the category of algebras $\mathcal{C}'$ for the monad over $\mathcal D$ that is induced by the adjunction, then $\mathcal D$ by the category $\mathcal{D}'$ of coalgebras for the comonad on $\mathcal{C}'$, and so on. In fact, this stabilises with the algebras over the coalgebras under the algebras, ie the next step is $\mathcal{D}''\cong\mathcal{D}'$. Indeed, only two steps are needed ($\mathcal{C}''\cong\mathcal{C}'$) if we started with categories in which idempotents split. Steve Lack first gave me the proof of this. Now suppose in addition that the base category $\mathcal{D}$, in Chris's case $\mathbf{Dcpo}$, has finite products and the monad has a strength, which it does in the case of $\mathbf{Frm}$. Then the category $\mathcal{D}'$ of coalgebras under the algebras also has finite products. These are the coproducts of algebras over $\mathbf{Loc}$ in Chris's question. At least so it says in some notes of mine called underlyingset/universal possibly from March 2007. The proof is quite complicated and works with strong monads in the abstract rather than frames, though it was motivated by exactly this question. I might be persuaded to re-upload these notes into my brain to see whether the proof is correct. The question of the existence of coequalisers of algebras for a monad (or equalisers in $\mathcal{D}'$ in my setting) is a notoriously difficult one. The objects of the category $\mathbf{Dcpo}'$ in my notation above (which is the opposite of the category of algebras in Chris's question) are called localic locales by Steve Vickers and colocales by me. If any progress is to be made with the investigation of this category and the furtherance of the motivations behind it, or even in getting more than three people interested, I think some more concrete description is needed of the objects. Even abstractly, an object of $\mathcal C'$ admits at most one morphism that makes it a coalgebra (object of $\mathcal D'$). Hence a colocale is a special kind of frame, whilst of course a frame is a special dcpo. The adjunctions that Chris considers in his question contain the monadic one that gives my programme Abstract Stone Duality its name as full subcategories. The latter relates continuous frames to locally compact locales, so any continuous frame is a colocale. In particular, the free frame on any semilattice qua semilattice is continuous and therefore already a colocale. My feeling is that Steve Vickers has already provided enough tools in his investigations of presentations of frames and of powerlocales, along with the methods of Formal Topology, to give a useful characterisation of colocales. Using this, the colocale structure on (the free frame on) any semilattice would be described by some kind of modal logic. Given the representation of a frame as a cover relation on a semilattice (or a nucleus on the free frame on this semilattice), the question would therefore appear to amount to asking whether the cover relation is compatible with the modal logic. How can colocales be special frames but also generalise locally compact spaces? The mis-match comes from the application of the functor: the locally compact space corresponds to the colocale structure on its continuous frame of opens. Studying bases would eliminate this excessively free structure. I look forward to seeing the results of Chris's investigations of this.
