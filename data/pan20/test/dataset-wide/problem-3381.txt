In brief, whether speech error data is relevant to the question of derivational order in syntax depends on just how much explanation syntactic theory owes to a theory of linguistic performance. 

Some student saw every professor There is a (single) student (say, John) such that he saw every professor For every professor x, there is a (different) student that saw x There is a solution to every problem There is a (single) solution such that it applies to every problem For every problem x, there is a (different) solution for x 

Does any language express the less form using bound morphology the way we do with -er in (1) and (2)? 

Extensive typological study doesn't appear to have been done on this. However, this is probably so because it has been difficult to say precisely what the mass/count distinction is about. What we can understand is that the mass/count distinction tracks (imperfectly) an important human cognitive distinction between objects (or, countables) and substances (or, uncountables, "fake mass nouns" like furniture aside). As with many conceptual distinctions, different languages may mark the difference overtly, others may not. To give a different example, a language like West Greenlandic has a host of "pluractional" morphemes that attach to verbs, one of which indicates whether an event description picks out a series of iterative events, or whether it picks out a single event of continuous extent. English doesn't have such morphemes, but interestingly in this language we see certain event descriptions as underdetermining the two uses (e.g., John ran more than Mary last year, if true, can mean he ran on more occasions (iterative), or for a greater temporal or spatial extent (continuative)). So a conceptual distinction that is overtly marked in West Greenlandic is left implicit in English. Similarly, English does not mark mass occurrences of nouns, but marks individual (with the indefinite article a(n)) and plural (with the -s suffix) occurrences of nouns. The bare form of a noun is often understood on a material reading (which is why the gruesome interpretation in There was boy all over the road, as if uttered after a horrific accident), and singular/plural occurrences are understood as picking out a singularity or multiplicity of individuals that fall under the concept named by the noun. If a language, for example, doesn't have a singular/plural distinction, one might think that noun occurrences there are understood via a combination of the preferred conceptualizations of things falling under the concept (e.g., we think of boy best as describing individual boys, and water best as describing an unindividuated substance), and extralinguistic context. The grammar doesn't force such speakers to express which conception they intend. An oft-discussed counterexample to the idea that the distinction is universal, is the claim that all nouns are actually mass in Chinese---"count" nouns don't exist except in the sense that they are "built up" in combination with classifiers. However, as Cheng and Sybesma argue, and Chierchia accepts, even this language has reflexes of the conceptual distinction---i.e., it uses only "classifiers" for nouns that are understood as "count" (i.e., highly individuated), and only "massifiers" for those understood as "mass" (i.e., low individuation). In sum, the role of grammar seems to be specifying what kind of conceptualization we're after. In English, there are a lot of nouns that are comfortable occurring as either mass or count, the difference ending up in whether we want to express a notion of the material, rock, or that of some quantity of individuals comprised of that material, rocks. Other occurrences, like muds seem less acceptable, but this could just be a matter of the frequency with which we encounter individuated MUD; if we can talk about kinds of muds or jars that contain some mud in a context, so that I bought three muds at the mud store isn't really so bad. Extralinguistic context can help us individuate even under the concept MUD. Whether a language uses grammar to express the mass/count distinction will be a fact about particular languages, but the conceptual distinction is likely universal.

I understand the overall meaning of your question as relations between forms and semantics of imperative and various forms of past tense. In Sanscrit (another ancient language), the Imperative did belong to a group of present-tense forms, although some endings of Imperative were similar to those of imperfective forms. Also, injunctive forms in Sanskrit were conveying the meaning of imperative having forms partially similar to a past tense. (The source, in Russian) The living languages offer us at least two examples with imperatives that are both past and perfective. In French, the Past Imperative (impératif passé) is used only to describe something that should have been done by a certain time (I think it is used in sentences of 'it-should-have-been-done-by-yesterday style): Aie écrit ce rapport demain. Have this report written by tomorrow. (quoted from this page) In Russian, the past perfective imperative conveys a meaning of rude command (third person perfective past tense): Вернул на место! returned-P.T.-Sg.-Masc. - to - place-Acc. Neut. Sg. Inanimate You (to a man), give it back at once! Заплатил сейчас же! payed-PT-Sg.-Masc. - now - INTENSIFIER You (to a man), pay immediately! The thing is that in Ancient Greek, as far as I remember, the imperatives had two forms similar to past tenses. The Aorist Imperative conveyed the meaning of perfectiveness, yet not necesserily related to a past. cf: λέγε (imperatīvus praesentis) - speak! εἰπέ (imperatīvus aoristi) - say! (the source, in Russian) The Perfective Imperative in Ancient Greek is, according to Corien Bary (p. 5) similar to that existing in Slavic languages. Therefore, my conclusion is that the Perfective Imperative in Ancient Greek is a form of modal command regarding an action that should have been done, from a speaker's point of view, by a certain time beforme the moment of utterance. It was also used as a form of command for a single action (p. 5, another source in English, where the cited form of imperative 'raised the sails!' makes a lot of sense from a Slavic point of view: urgent, emotionally intensified command, and/or a reference to a one-time action). 

I had a thought a few days ago while I was thinking about conlangs. If a language had a strict verb-final order, it could easily get away without using punctuation to show the end of a sentence. German somewhat does this. Its sub-clauses are always SOV (simple sentences are normally V2 order). This means that the end of a sub-clause is marked by the verb, which makes center embedding rather easy. Of course, there are languages that really were written without punctuation in the past. East Asia didn't have punctuation until recently. And Latin, at least early on, didn't even put spaces between words. Of course, the far east has an advantage in that they use logographs heavily (though Korean has largely abandoned their use). Thus they don't need to use spaces to show word boundaries (and yes, I know Japanese has a syllabrary, but word boundaries are still pretty obvious most of the time since logographs have to always appear at the beginning of a word, thus a syllable followed by a logograph always indicates a word boundary). Also, both Japanese and Korean are SOV. Chinese, however, is SVO and configurational. I don't get how they could get away without marking sentence boundaries. And note, this was all in the ancient past. There's probably a good reason why languages today all have punctuation. They at the very least will indicate the boundary between sentences, if nothing else. 

Languages tend to drop their inflections over time. Eventually, people just get tired of all the irregularities and complex conjugations/inflections and so they gradually drop out of use. Of course, not all languages do this. The Slavic languages for example were just as inflectional as Latin 2,000 years ago. But whereas the romance languages (Latin's descendents) have for the most part become more isolating, the Slavic languages have only become even more inflecting. The number of irregular verbs in those languages is just rediculous. As for why European languages are all so similar? Contact. They're all part of a 'sprachbund' called 'standard average european' (or SAE for short). Well, not all of them. The celtic languages aren't a part of the sprachbund, even though Hungarian is (its not even related to either the Germanic or Romance languages). But the point is in a Sprachbund, languages tend to borrow grammatical features from eachother. Its why they all have undergone similar changes. Its not that languages become simpler over time, its just an illusion caused by the odd history and development of the European languages. Besides, if languages did tend towards a 'simple' configurational grammar like English, then by now all languages on Earth would be like Chinese. Yes, even 'simple' languages like English can develop complexities. If you want to know how case endings develop, it starts with a language that is postpositional (meaning it relies on postpositions far more than prepositions). Over time, the space between the noun and the postposition vanish, turning it into a suffix. And sound change then further distorts the suffix. And because nouns don't all end in the same sound, each suffix will evolve differently depending on which phoneme the noun originally ended in, thus creating multiple declinations. It should be noted that the 'grammatical gender' thing was something the Romans came up with to try and deduce a logical pattern to which declination a noun belonged to, because they had no way of knowing how it came to be in the first place. Though it should be noted that case endings can develop in other ways too. Some languages have just outright borrowed case endings from another language, causing them to develop case endings seemingly out of nowhere. You could say that some languages are simpler than others in some ways (some languages do have more irregularities than others). But overral, the difference isn't that much, and languages don't tend towards becoming 'simpler' perpetually. They can just as easily become even more irregular. 

Because meaning refers to a particular or specific case or example, something practical, whilest semantic or semantics refer to an abstract theory of language in general, to metanarration. 

I think the best outcome you can hope for is an information about the eldest written record of this language. Comparative language study with a glottochronological method is a way different service which requires time and money, and more time, than money. 

Spanish: ella (she) => ellas (they) Finnish: tämä (this evident) => nämä (these evident) tuo (that evident) => nuo (those evident) se (that, non-evident) => ne (those, non-evident) The marker N is said by Michael Fortescue to be the remnant of common Nostratic plural -n, present in modern Semito-Hamitic and Germanic languages (and also in a rare form of plural in Komi: pi => pian (son => sons). Cf. also Komi pi with English boy, Finnish poika, Swedish pojke, all the three being of presumably unknown etymology). 

Different languages have different grammatical numbers. For most IE languages, these are Singular, Plural and, sometimes, Dual. Other languages have grammatical numbers differentiated by the quantity of 'items' (from Dual to Trial, e.g. in Bislama, and Quadral, as in Sursurunga). Many Austronesian languages have paucal number depending on quantity of 'items' counted (up to 27). Other languages (including samples of extinct Sumerian) have two more types of grammatical number not defined by the quantity of items, namely, Collective (as opposed to Singulative) and Distributive (as in Navajo or in Finnish 'kuukausittain' = 'by [separate groups of] months', 'parvittain' = by [separate quantities of] animal groups, 'kerroittain' = 'by [separate groups of] times [of events]', etc. Sumerian, according to Kaneva (2006 in Russian only) also had a 'Sortive' type of grammatical number. In ancient Tocharian languages (at least in Western Tocharian), there had been a Dual and a Pair Grammatical numbers; the former was applyed for random pair combinations, and the latter, for natural and inseparable ones (like 'eyes', 'nostrils', etc.). In Basque, there is also a type of 'Indeterminate' (literally, 'Infinite') grammatical number ('mugagabea'), or verb aspct. Are there any other types of grammatical numbers in other languages? 

This is something I've been thinking about. It would be rather hard to tell a story without using a pluperfect. I know there are languages that lack tense, like Chinese, but what about languages that do have tense systems? Japanese for instance has pretty much just past and non-past. What kind of structure would they use where we would use a pluperfect? I should note that the only languages I'm deeply familiar with are English (my native language) and German (which does have a pluperfect, formed the same way we form one in English). I did study Japanese for a few years when I was younger and into anime, but I never really got far into it. I only know the basics of the grammar. 

I'm asking this question for a conlang. I know that's normally two subjective for this forum, but honestly, I think this may be an exception. I tend to try to keep things as terse as possible. Often times my case endings are just the 5 or so vowels of the language. Nothing more. But I was wondering, would this be too minimalist for common use? Not that I intend my conlang to actually be used, but it would just seem weird to me for the fictional people who speak my language to use something that would be unusable in the real world. You can't have things be too minimalistic, you need redundancy. Humans don't catch every phoneme pronounced, and this problem is even worse over a phone. So in general its a bad idea to have distinctions that differ only in one phoneme. Not that this doesn't happen (English's plural and possessive endings are an example, also there's only one phoneme of difference between 'can' and 'can't'). But looking at languages that do have case systems, they don't just change the final vowel and leave it at that. They often add consonants, sometimes entire syllables, when declining their nouns. Also, I've noticed that languages seem to dislike having endings that are just a single vowel be anywhere close to eachother. For example, in Latin, there is no declination where two of the cases are marked with -i and -e. And in Finnish the only cases that end in a vowel are -a and -i, all the others are differentiated by consonants too. Russian does allow nouns to take an -i or -e ending for different cases, even in the same declination, though in Russian an -e always palatalizes the previous consonant, creating a redundancy. But looking at Latin and Finnish, I have noticed something. They do allow cases to be differentiated by just a consonant. For example, the Latin first declination singular ending for the nominative is -a, and -am for the accusative. And looking at the second declination again, I see that there is a long -i ending that contrasts with a short -e ending, in the second declination. Still, the different lengths is a redundancy. I find this interesting that I can't seem to find a language with cases differentiated with a single vowel (or close ones at least), but languages seem to have nothing against cases being differentiated by a single consonant. Is this universal? If there was a language where the case endings were just -a, -e, -i, -o, and -u, would speakers find these too similar to each other? Would they require some extra redundancy, like a consonant being added to one of the front vowel cases to differentiate it from the other, lengthening one, or just letting the two cases merge into one? Essentially, this is a question as to how much redundancy is necessary. Obviously, redundancy is necessary, but how little can you get away? What is the minimum redundancy that is necessary? Does anyone even know the answer to this? 

Are there any regular phonetical correspondences between grammatical patterns of both dialects? Which one is thought to be the 'real' Armenian? When and how did the dialects split? Is Western Armenian an offspring of the Eastern dialect, or did the dialects appear during a synchronous process? 

First, let us define what'a free word order' is and how the word order fuctions in different languages. E.g. Russian or Polish are reputed for being 'languages with free word order', but you never find a preposition at the end of a sentence in those languages. Within the atlas, Russian is classified as a SVO language (together with Mandarin). The word order in Russian and Polish carries the meaning of theme/rheme, or the same meaning is conveyed with Japanese -wa/-ga nominative markers. Speaking on Japanese, its word order is not quite 'free', either (unless we consider phrases like 'watakusi-mo' (me, too) or 'heya-ga!' (the house!) being sentences. Basically, an elaborate Japanese sentence ends up with a predicate. Hence, we need a universal definition for a sentence or, for that matter, for a predicate. Japanese is classified within the same atlas as a SOV language. In Mandarin Chinese, the word order is used to define what part of speech a given 'word' is. Hence, we should also define 'a word'. According to the atlas, Mandarin falls under the same category as Russian, Finnish or Swedish (SVO). The two latter languages show a 'free word order', but never in sentences with subject-object clauses (hence, the examples with 'Ali went to school' and 'malchik voshel v komnatu' are wrong examples; the right ones are like 'Ali gave a present to a friend' or 'On arendoval komnatu na paru let'). Thus, the only language on the atlas list with a proper 'free word order' is Hungarian, where the word order conveys the meaning of theme/rheme dichotomy.
