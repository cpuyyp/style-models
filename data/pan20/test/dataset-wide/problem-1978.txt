You are, of course, perfectly free to decline to do such a test. But that means that the company is also perfectly free to decline to consider you any further. Realistically, if you want the job, you probably need to go through whatever interview process the company has set up. If you have a particularly rare skill set or a particularly strong resume, you could certainly ask the company whether they could waive a particular step. For example, if you've written a book on network programming in Java, it probably doesn't make sense for the company to ask you to build a chat client as part of the application process. If you have a GitHub repository or a StackOverflow profile that has examples of code that demonstrates whatever the test is attempting to measure, it's probably reasonable to mention these things and ask if they could be considered instead of the test. But if you're just a run-of-the-mill developer, it's unlikely that the company is going to change the way they're doing interviews just for you. 

Since your paychecks were signed by B, you were never employed by A. So you'd answer "no" to the question. If there is space to expand on the answer, you could certainly explain the previous position. Generally, companies ask the question to determine whether they have existing HR records for the applicant. If you worked at A for years and left on good terms, the fact that they can pull up your old HR records is a good thing. If you got fired from A a couple years ago, the old HR records probably disqualify you. If you weren't employed by A, even if you were employed by B which contracted to do some work for A, A isn't going to have any old HR records to consult. 

If you're aware of the risks when you take the job and you're comfortable that the benefits outweigh the risks, there is no issue taking a job and honoring the letter of the contract but no more. 

You can modify the subject and forward the thread. However, that probably isn't what you want to do. Unless you are confident that the decision maker really wants to read through a long thread where ten different people have weighed in with their suggestions, the decision maker really needs a summary of what was discussed, the options on the table, and the consensus of the group about the pros and cons of the various options. When you produce that summary, there is no need to forward the existing long thread. That summary almost certainly deserves a separate email thread. Not forwarding the email thread up the chain of command also has other benefits. When a team is discussing options internally, they tend to be quite a bit blunter than they would be when speaking to management or to other teams. They may make a joke or two or make a comment that someone outside the team might interpret differently. If you forward that sort of thread to decision-makers, that has a strong probability of embarrassing someone in the team. 

It depends. In general, printing, signing, faxing (or mailing), and waiting for the other party to sign the contract gives you the greatest degree of legal coverage. On the other hand, that can take some time particularly when the client has a legal department that has to review the exact verbiage and wants to clarify some terms. When there are tight deadlines, that process can use up a lot of valuable time. It may well be reasonable to start working with just an email that the other party replies to that outlines the general terms of the agreement. This introduces the risk that you'll do work that you ultimately won't get paid for. But it eliminates the risk that you're going to be idle waiting for the contract to be signed and it can help get your working relationship off on the right foot who sees you as committed to helping them resolve their problems rather than being committed to getting contracts in place. As part of this, you'll want to consider how useful your legal coverage is likely to be. Even if you've got an iron-clad contract, you probably want to be aware of whether it would ever be worth your time to try to collect if, for whatever reason, the client decides not to pay. If you're doing a small project where you'll only make a few hundred dollars and the client is located in a different jurisdiction, you probably wouldn't bother suing and would just have to write off the invoice if they decide not to pay. Filing a small claims case and spending time convincing a judge that you delivered probably wouldn't be financially sensible-- you'd be better off spending those hours doing work and simply writing off the invoice. On the other hand, if you're incurring more risk-- if you're doing a fixed price contract for tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars of work that will require hiring a bunch of subcontractors, having that iron-clad contract in place is much more critical. You'll need to decide how best to balance these factors. You may be comfortable starting work earlier with a client that you've done work for before. You may initially prefer to start work earlier when you don't have other work competing for your attention and wait for contracts to be signed when you have a bunch of other things in your queue that you can be working on. 

Not revealing that you know (or think you know) what other employees make shouldn't be too hard since it is irrelevant. What your teammates do (or do not do) at work is also irrelevant. Your salary doesn't depend on the salary of other employees. It doesn't depend on whether someone takes a long lunch or watches YouTube from time to time. If your manager cares about those things, your manager will address the issue with those employees. Your salary depends on your ability to demonstrate value to your company. If you are a developer, that means delivering code. If you want a raise, you need to present your boss with evidence that your value to the company is substantially greater than your salary and that you have earned a raise. That will involve figuring out what you have delivered in the 7 months you'e been employed and the value that brought to the company. If you can demonstrate that your value on the open market is higher (via salary survey sites, for example), all the better. Assuming that you are confident that the value you have delivered substantially outstrips the cost of your salary (making no reference to what anyone else has delivered or what anyone else has been paid), request a meeting with your boss and make your pitch. Depending on the company, it's entirely possible that your manager will suggest addressing the issue at annual review time-- most companies are going to be hesitant to increase the salary of someone that has only been working for the company for seven months. Getting budget authorization for a mid-year raise is likely to be a politically contentious task-- you may need an extremely compelling case in order to get your manager to make the case up the management chain. 

There are two sides to the coin. From the business perspective, it doesn't make sense to pay more if they can't find enough work for you to do. From your perspective, your value is independent of how well your employer can attract appropriate clients. So, in some sense, you're both right. In practice, what this means is often that your employer can't afford to have a full time web developer. That means that you would need to find a new job at a company that can afford to pay you what you're worth. And it means that your employer would need to find a cheaper employee, probably one that can do a bit of development but that can also do the IT support that the company is built around. Of course, your employer might decide to dedicate the resources to marketing to attract more web development clients. Or you might decide that there are other aspects to this job that make it worthwhile for you to accept below-market wages. But an amicable separation is the most common result. 

I don't believe the comment intended to make a statement of legality but one of practicality. Practically, an employer generally doesn't care whether you choose to live in a modest place nearby so that you can spend less time commuting or in a nicer place further away so that you can have a nice lawn. And it's generally not reasonable to expect your employer to provide accommodations for you because of your choices. However, if an employer decides to change where an existing employee commutes to, then it's generally reasonable for employer and employee to have a conversation about how this affects the employee's commute and to consider reasonable accommodations. If an employer decides that it wants to change where you are commuting to, it bears some practical responsibility to deal with the impact of those changes. It may well have no legal responsibility ((though this will depend on the location and a ton of specifics about the situation) but reasonable employers will generally want to find a way to keep their employee happy in this sort of situation. The employer generally recognizes that if it is changing the terms of employment in a way that negatively affects the employee, it's generally cheaper to make it up to that employee than to risk having the employee go somewhere else. Of course, there are times when an employer isn't going to be willing (or able) to accommodate an employee in this sort of situation. If they're closing one office or transferring thousands of employees from one office to another, they're probably not going to be willing to work with each affected employee to figure out how the change impacts them. They're probably going to expect instead that they'll lose a fair number of the affected employees over the next few months. If the employer is closing/ consolidating operations because they're under financial stress, this sort of attrition is probably going to be seen by management as a good thing. 

Don't read into things. Sometimes you won't get a call back for a couple of days because the person you're trying to contact is busy. Sometimes you won't get a call back because they're out sick or taking a day off. Sometimes they find out that the hiring manager already filled the position. Sometimes they're waiting for the hiring manager to reply to an email. Sometimes they received hundreds of applications for the position and are working their way through them before calling people back. In any case, the reason for the delay shouldn't affect your behavior. You've called back already. Give it a few days. If you don't hear back, it may make sense to call again in a few days. You should always operate on the assumption that they're not going to call back/ offer you the job/ etc. so you should be applying to other opportunities. 

The primary benefit of getting things in writing when you're an at will employee isn't to prevent the company from intentionally weaseling out on promises. The primary benefit is to ensure that both parties agree on exactly what was discussed so that if and when an issue comes up in the future, there is a written document that both parties agreed to that can be referenced. Companies are generally not in the business of promising the moon to potential employees with no reasonable intention of following through. Sure, it would be possible for the employer to hire a new at will employee at a salary of $x and then announce on the second day of employment that, unfortunately, the employee's salary had to be reduced to 0.5*$x. That's perfectly legal but it would seriously damage the company's reputation and make it very difficult for the company to recruit good candidates in the future. Getting things in writing ensures that the company fully intends to honor the terms of the agreement. If you get an offer of $x in writing, that implies that everyone has signed off on that number, the number has been budgeted, and that the company fully intends to pay you that amount. Similarly, if you get written assurances that you'll get n hours per week to devote to improving some open source package, that's a pretty strong guarantee that everyone that needs to sign off on such a clause has signed off on it. Is it possible that in 6 months something will change and the project will no longer be something the company leverages or that the project will fork and the company will want you to focus on a fork that you might not prefer? Sure, that's possible. But you can at least be confident that on day 1, you and the company are on the same page about expectations. Unfortunately, when people discuss contract terms without writing them down, it is very common for people to hear what they want to hear and for both parties to have a different understanding of the agreement. For example, your prospective manager might talk about being supportive about conferences that you'd like to attend. To that manager, that might mean something like giving you paid time off to attend local conferences. To you, that might mean the company footing the bill for a conference across the country plus airfare and hotel accommodations. Getting things in writing forces both sides to clarify their point of view and identifies where there are discrepancies. If the company is going to agree to, say, a $5000 budget for conference fees, hotels, flights, etc. then that has to be incorporated into the company budget. Written agreements are also much clearer when additional parties are involved-- if the person that hires you moves on and is no longer your manager, it's much easier for your new manager to refer to a written agreement than to try to figure out what you and someone else verbally agreed to. Of course, it is possible that in the future things will change and the company will be unable to live up to some of the promises they made-- funding falls through, sales fail to materialize, etc. If a company is trying to decide between honoring commitments they made in writing to one employee or general verbal assurances it made to some other employee, though, the general verbal assurances are likely to be abandoned first.
