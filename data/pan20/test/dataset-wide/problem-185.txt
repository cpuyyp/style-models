The animals in nature with the best singing vices are birds; they achieve their facility by virtue of their syrinx, an organ located at the fork of the trachea. A humanoid with a syrinx would be able to produce two separate notes simultaneously. It is also shown that some species of bird are able to vary the notes they produce extremely rapidly, potentially altering the note produced with each vibratory cycle of the syrinx membranes, potentially introducing harmonics that the being could use to emulate any sound in their syrinx's pitch range, and could emulate an instrument with more than two notes. This could quite easily be used to produce sounds that could be considered to sound similar to a pipe organ. An interesting side effect of this is that said humanoids would simply open their mouths and complex sounds would come out - there would be little need for manipulation of the lips, tongue and pharynx. The primary disadvantage would be that said humanoids would have difficulty producing sibilant sounds - their tendency would probably be to produce a whistle rather than a hiss - due to the many rapid random variations in syrinx tension that would be required. They should be able to produce sibilants as we do (turbulent airflow past the tongue), but the idea may be quite alien to them initially. 

There are several avenues by which such a poisoning might occur, depending on just how advanced the site's security really is. All involve poisons that are effective in small quantities that are easily slipped past the detectors described. The first method is poisoning by Ricin. When airborne, this is lethal in quantities of less than 2 milligrams. When administered as an airborne compound, with a particle size sufficiently small, the scanning sensors would either not see it or consider it to be dust. The one potential drawback is that there is now an immunisation against Ricin, though it would be unlikely that the target would have received it. The second method is poisoning by Polonium-110. Yes, it's radioactive, but it's primarily an alpha-emitter, and alpha particles are blocked by a fairly thin layer of solid material. The gammas it emits are a thousandth of its radiation output. Since Polonium is lethal in microgram amounts, it could be difficult to detect if suitably encapsulated to block alphas, and especially if those few micrograms are distributed around the assassin's gear. If the enemy organisation has radiation sensors, it should be possible to get a similar one and determine if the Polonium is detectable before risking the assassin. Both poisons have the advantage of taking days before symptoms are noticed, and yet a longer time before they become serious enough to be taken for something less than merely inconvenient. A very slightly modified ecigarette with its power circuit rigged to turn on automatically after a certain time could be used as a diffuser for the toxin, whatever it is. If the agent 'loses' it, despite the volumetric sensors, it could be some time before someone actually notices this piece of miscellanea amongst all the other miscellanea that humans generate naturally, from dust to paperclips to pens and pencils that have rolled under the furniture. Do the guards really notice and respond to every dropped pen, pencil, paperclip, coin, hair, flake of skin, crumb of food, or whatever? It's not stated that the 3D scanners can do anything other than tell the exterior shape of a thing, and while something like a gun would likely be recognised as a weapon, an e-cigarette likely would not. Depending on the frequency of cleaning, a dropped item might remain out of sight for some time, probably for up to 8 hours (no-one wants cleaners disturbing the real employees when they're working), and potentially longer, up to days if the cleaners aren't punctilious about sweeping under and behind every bit of furniture. The slacker the cleaners have been observed to be, the longer the timer on the ecigarette can be set before it turns on, and the assassin may well be out of the complex before that happens. The agent need not even know what it is that he is carrying. All he (or she) needs to know is that the ecigarette must be lost in the target's workspace after loading it with a particular substance. Not deliberately hidden, just plausibly accidentally dropped so that it lands out of sight. No matter how sensitive 3d sensors may be, if they can't see inside the assassin's pockets (and again it isn't stated that they can), there's no telling between a deliberate or accidental loss. This accidental loss might require specific training in spycraft, but just about everything else the assassin needs to do would look entirely normal. If the poison is Polonium, then the Polonium could be extracted from its radiation-blocking carrier under the cover of blankets at night, in the dark. With training, the assassin could consider this a normal activity, and not be particularly nervous about it, though doing the task just after retiring after a pre-bedtime exercise session would throw off the bio-monitors, and the 3d sensors aren't stated to be able to see through things - if they could, they'd probably be emitting x-rays constantly, which could throw off radiation scanning in the admissions area. If the agent was to be infected with the flu or a common cold just before infiltrating, the resultant outbreak of the inconvenient but hardly lethal illness could mask the much more serious poisoning. 

Place your humans there at the beginning of the first fossil-fuel-accumulation era, so that any fossil fuels that will accumulate will do so after the humans have had their day, so to speak. As the oldest coal deposits on Earth were laid down in the Carboniferous era, starting your scenario about that time would eliminate this fossil fuel. Have a world with little or no plate tectonics so that fossil fuels will not accumulate. The best you'd get in the way of fossil fuels in this situation is peat bogs. In order to have the necessary conditions, an earth-size & mass world would have to have a smaller moon, a more distant moon, and/or no moon at all, and/or the world itself would have to be smaller, in order to reduce tectonic activity. 

So, we have genetically engineered big cats with genetically inflated brains. However, these are cat brains, and not ape brains. Now, Ligers are crosses between lions and tigers, so while tigers are pretty much solitary, lions, or at least lionesses are quite social (the males are sociable to a lesser degree), so we can expect at least some of that sociability. I am presuming that Ligers' brains are simply scaled up big cat brains without any geneticist-imposed imperatives. Communication Cats do communicate with each other, despite being largely solitary, except for lions, and, we can presume, ligers. They would share the basic language of the cats from which they descended, of sounds and body language. However, with inflated brains would come inflated language centres, and additional complexity in communication is a certainty. That their communication would be quite unlike ape communication is also pretty much a certainty. While apes vocal communication takes the form of a variety of hoots and screeches, and this is modified to more modulated vocal communication, cats communicate vocally with more limited growls and roars. While this could be modulated to a human-intelligible voice, there is no reason for it to be so convenient for us. Some bird calls sound like a fairly bland raucous squawk, but examine them using modern sound processing equipment, and you'll find that there are subtle, rapid frequency shifts. So might our Ligers have particularly resonant roars that are carriers for subtle frequency shifts and harmonics in which information can be conveyed. As cats are known for their particularly good hearing, they would have no problem receiving such communication. So, we have communication that to a human ear still sounds like a roar, perhaps modulated a bit, but if a human tried to emulate that, it would sound to the Ligers like a monkey trying to emulate a human voice would sound to humans - amusing or infantile at best. As for the particulars of their language(s)... that could be a whole other question in itself. However, we can state that for complex communication to occur, there should be distinct words, however the linguistic typology will most likely differ from that of humans, and the content would differ due to the different life experiences. As for communicating with humans, we may well find that the ligers are better able to understand human language than humans could understand their speech, due to their neurology. We can still not understand dolphins or elephants, but they are quite able to understand us in a limited way. Sociability With sociability comes the necessity for social interaction. You can't get away from it without having the blood and corpses of your former pride-mates everywhere. So, we can expect that our ligers would talk amongst each other, and engage in both verbal and physical social grooming. However, due to the lower pitch of their voices, their communication would carry far further than would a human voice in the same circumstances, we could expect that a greater degree of physical separation between members of a pride would be comfortable than would be the case for humans, but they could also be comfortable with sleeping in very close proximity. As to what would constitute verbal social grooming, for humans it is the weather - we don't like getting rained on much. For ligers, it may be something else of common interest, such as "How's the prey running today?" or "Have you smelled the wind today?" Mindset Humans are highly social omnivorous apes with concealed estrous, and that colours our mindset very strongly. However, Ligers are mildly social carnivorous cats, probably still with overt estrous. As a top predator throughout their evolutionary history (as opposed to humans who have become top predators relatively recently), we can expect a certain degree of confidence that humans lack. However, even a pride of lions must be wary of other predator species. On the other hand, predators are to a degree cowardly by human standards. A solitary predator cannot afford to take an injury when hunting, so they take as few risks as possible. However, social hunters such as lions can afford to take more risks as they have family to fall back on in case of injury. Ligers would fall between these extremes. Big cats have been observed to catch the young of prey species alive to give to their own offspring as toys to practice hunting upon. There is no reason why Ligers would be any different. Quite obviously Ligers would see any species incapable of proactively fighting back as being potential prey, but like most predators, they would not be averse to reducing the numbers of other, competing, predatory species if the opportunity presented itself. They would be smart enough to recognise humans as being a predatory species highly inclined to retaliate for the obvious loss of members to predator species, but if the opportunity presented itself for the quiet "disappearance" of a solitary human, they'd jump at it (pun intended). As predators descending from a species with fewer or more specific mirror neurons, Ligers would have some empathy for their own kind, and to other cats to a lesser degree than humans have for monkeys, but would have pretty much none for other species. Any pain or inconvenience that they may inflict on other species would be either a matter of indifference or utility - if by deliberately causing a non-fatal injury, they could gain some advantage, they wouldn't hesitate. No animal protection society for them. On the other hand, Ligers may feel quite a degree of like toward other species, much as human farmers tend to like their livestock. That Ligers can like the species that they prey on, and then go on to terrorise and kill members of those species would not be perceived as anything unusual by the ligers. Ligers, probably having an overt oestrous cycle like other cats, would be unlike humans in their sexual behaviour. Humans use sex as an intimate bonding activity, whereas for Ligers, sex would be an occasional enjoyable diversion and other activities - such as mutual grooming and conversation - would be used for social bonding. Since, like lions, the main social bonds would likely between members of like gender, and mainly between the females of a pride, it is likely that despite any difference in size favouring the males, males would be viewed as the second-class gender, that the females keep around to fight other males and to have fun with when estrus occurs, and the rest of the time, they are considered a bit useless. Male lions have a tendency to kill the offspring of other males, unless they are closely related, however Liger females may be highly protective of their own offspring, and are unlikely to allow this to happen if they can help it. Infanticide by males would likely be one of those nasty little throwbacks to primitive behaviour that occurs now and then in any species, and the culprit would be unlikely to be allowed to profit from such a crime as may be the case with less intelligent species of cat. Male Ligers would struggle against their instinctive dislike of unrelated cubs and oppose it with the need to be near the female ligers in order to engender their own offspring. As creatures with some intelligence, however, the female Ligers may allow a degree of infanticide as a means of population control and fitness selection. Very young cubs would be protected as long as they were healthy (and not if they were otherwise) and conditions permit (Lions will abandon their cubs if times are hard), but older cubs may be subjected to tests involving a high degree of risk of death. This could be in some form of military training led by adult males (who would be the primary fighters, as opposed to the females who would be the primary hunters), and it is possible that any significant training injuries or other major failures for cubs would be punishable by death, providing incentive for the others, and strengthening the bloodline by removing defective genetic material. As a predatory species, Ligers would likely have little sympathy with any members who did not have the potential of being useful members of a pride. Certainly they would look after injured individuals who had the potential for recovery, but crippling injuries, illnesses or birth defects would earn the sufferer only contempt, regardless of that individual's previous strengths. Tool Use This section pre-supposes that Ligers do not have genetically-modified opposable thumbs. With greatly enhanced intelligence comes the ability to manipulate the environment. Cats are not the least dextrous species, despite having thumbs of only limited opposability, as they use their paws to grasp their prey. The structure of the cat paw allows for some limited ability to grasp objects between the pad of the hand and the digits. However, for Ligers, the manipulation of objects is more likely to be a calculated or learned ability, rather than the instinctive activity it is for humans. A Liger wouldn't instinctively think of throwing something, but with the power of observation and reason, they could quickly learn from the example provided by other animals (such as humans). They are unlikely to ever be as good at it as humans, as in comparison their paws are large and clumsy, but what they may lack in finesse, they would make up in power. A Liger would not see most human doors as much of an obstacle, when they have the size and strength to crash through them, though if they were being stealthy they could use a human door handle and maybe even a round knob (Humans: Recess those circular doorknobs!) It is possible that after observing humans that Ligers may be able to make simple flint tools, shaped to fit the feline paw. These, in turn, could be used to assist in the production of simple traps, such as covered pits or deadfalls, though a Liger's sharp teeth and claws would be additional tools readily available for most purposes. Relations with Humans Ligers would see Humans as inherently weak, making up for serious deficiencies in strength, toughness, claws and dentition with some clever feats of dexterity. On the other hand, a Liger is strong, tough and smart, strong enough that they can make mincemeat of a number of humans in a stand-up fight, and smart and stealthy enough to avoid being shot by those humans' pesky projectiles. Even if some humans managed to capture a Liger cub - and managed to communicate with it - the cub would inevitably grow to see its human captors as weak and contemptible, regardless of how successfully they might restrain their captive for a while. For the most part, Humans would be considered as an Other Predatory Species, and no true peace could exist between the two species. Ligers may pretend to compromise with humans, but they would always be looking for an opportunity to rid their range of these competitors. Given the potential danger that a human community poses, any action is likely to be a swift, decisive elimination of that human community in it's entirety rather than a piecemeal reduction in human numbers that would allow and even encourage retaliation.
