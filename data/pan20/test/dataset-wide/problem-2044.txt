In my opinion, you should not include hobbies, interests, and activities on your CV. I've read thousands of CVs/resumes in the years I've been a hiring manager. I've never once seen anything in a list of hobbies that made a candidate more appealing, but I've seen a few that made the candidate seem rather geeky/odd. (It's hard to determine if something we find personally interesting will seem equally interesting to others, or just odd. Many times it is the latter.) I remember reading one resume from a candidate who seemingly thought that online "gaming" was a sufficiently big part of his life that he listed the number of years he had played a particular game. Yet, he hadn't read a single book related to his profession. Not a positive from my perspective at all. For me, your CV needs to be professional. You want to convey your abilities for the job at hand. As an interviewer, that and your fit within my team are pretty much all I really care about. When we speak during an interview - that's the time when your personality can come across. And if I ask you something like "What do you do when you are not working?", that's when you can decide to inject a bit about your outside interests. The only exceptions I could think of, would be if you happen to know your interviewer shares a particular hobby/interest with you or when the hobby happens to be directly relevant to the job at hand. Perhaps then it would be appropriate to include them on your resume in hopes of catching her/his attention. If you do decide to include them on your CV anyway, just list them in a section at the bottom of the CV titled something professional like "Interests". Don't go crazy here - you don't want an interviewer to think your hobbies are more important to you than your work (even if that is actually the case). 

Making management aware of the difference between inherent risk, the security risks present before any safeguards are implemented and residual risk, the security risk that remains after safeguards (technical, administrative, and / or physical) is implemented is my first suggestion to you. Use specific, concrete examples of inherent risks and the associated impact, similar to examples given here. Without security safeguards in place, any of the risks identified in the preceding paragraph can easily impact this financial system resulting in loss to the company. This bring me to my second suggestion - educate management and other non security savvy folks, how safeguards such as DLP can be used to mitigate security risks. As an example: 

Do not be accusatory and try to avoid the use of the word you as well as words such as failed. These make objective findings (assuming valid ones backed by testing work papers) sound personal. People often react strongly and defensively to what they perceive to be personal failures. It has been my experience that deficiencies are often not the result of what one person did or failed to do, but of faulty process design, lack of resources, technological limitations, or ignorance. 

By the very fact that IT has the password to your computer means they can impersonate you. Any unscrupulous actions they take on the network will be traced directly back to you and there will be no way for you deny the action as its your account that was used. The fact that multiple other people can now use your account is immaterial, as in the audit logs, only your user ID will be associated with any changes, legitimate or malicious. Some of your statements are also problematic. You state that these people work in government and that IT is very informal. Just because IT operates in a informal manner, as is often the culture of IT, does not mean that security best practices are suddenly no longer applicable. 

Anything is possible, but in this case I don't see any conflict at all, unless you have a contract with your employer that prohibits such outside work. The vocal services at the funeral home and vocal services at the funeral mass aren't in competition with each other, and in a way may be complementary roles, right? I wouldn't be worried about it. 

This is a difficult one, since you were clearly confused regarding the level - you heard Senior Jock, you signed an offer for Jock, and now you look in the HR system and see Junior Jock. It would certainly make sense for you to talk with your manager, and perhaps HR to clear up this confusion. It's possible a mistake was made. It's also possible that positions have been re-graded. It might be possible that you were snookered, although that seems unlikely. And of course it's possible that you are still misunderstanding what really happened. As is often the case - you should talk to your boss first. Then, decide if you really need to be outraged or not. 

Yes, this might make you seem naggy, but in this case it doesn't sound like you have a lot of choice. If you cannot discern an appropriate email thru a Google search, call back now and leave a voicemail. This time, tell him that you don't have his email address, and that he could call you back at his convenience. It might not matter, but it probably won't hurt. 

If your work in a regulated field such as health care, certain regulations apply such as HIPPA. Penalties for incidents can be severe. Even if your industry is not regulated, consequences can still be severe in the form of lost current business as well as prospective future business if the password incident exposes customer data. To summarize my point: 

In this instance, I first remain calm. Rushing to respond in a defensive manner is not fruitful and will hurt my reputation. Next I try to validate what they are saying: 

This access monitoring and revocation process should be ongoing, and ideally continuous in a company. From your question, it appears you may be responsible for access provisioning / administration in your role. If true, with management consent, you should be periodically reviewing access and any improper / unauthorized / unaccounted for access discovered should be investigated and / or revoked upon discovery. 

I agree tat your current work place is unsuited for you, but for a different reason. Your manager seems to be the biggest problem. Quoting what you said: 

How do you track what changes have been made to the software, especially in the production environment, if one exists at your company? Given no change logs are used, how will you trace a change made and determine whether the change is authorized and not malicious? How do you trace changes to the users that made them, because if you can't do so, no one person can be held accountable if a changes breaks critical functionality. People remove code rather than deprecating old code. This is a very bad practice as you suggest. What happens if a release fails and has to be rolled back? Without old working code to revert to, there is the risk of business disruption due to inability to recover from a failure / disaster. 

It's good that they are all true, since it is best to always stick to the truth. But some of these are "safer" to discuss than others in an interview. 

Assuming you have no flexibility with your new employer, just give the notice and work out the notice period. If you do have flexibility, you might consider offering more notice period if that would help. Ask for specific things you can do to make it easier on the other 2 employees. Yes, it will be awkward. But that's just the way things are. These things happen. 

No. When you form your own company, you are allowed to bring all of your skills to bear - without regard to where you learned them (at least in the US). You aren't free to bring code with you, nor are you usually free to bring clients with you, and sometimes there are restrictions such as "trade secrets", and sometimes the contract and/or non-compete agreement limits how you can proceed. But for the most part the knowledge in your head is yours forever to use as you desire. 

This is very normal. Even the most self-assured among us might wonder what the future holds. Leaving academia and entering the working world is a big step. 

Technically, an incentive bonus is a financial reward you will receive in the future, if you attain some pre-determined goals. The bonus might be monetary, or it might be non-monetary (a trip, a gift, etc). You are entitled to receive the incentive bonus if you attain the agreed-upon goals. On the other hand, a bonus is a reward (usually financial) for past achievement, that is given at the discretion of management. Sometimes bonuses are awarded based on company performance, individual performance, or a combination of both. In many companies, however the term "bonus" and "incentive bonus" are used loosely and interchangeably. As with many things in business, the words have real meaning only in a specific context/locale. If you don't know the term, then it's unlikely that you have a "current incentive bonus". Thus, you probably should enter $0 in the application form. 

I am an information security professional working as an IT auditor. I am also the lead for my team. Recently we realized we had more budget money to spend for next year after immediate needs were fulfilled. I am currently experimenting with some tooling that I am thinking of recommending we purchase for the team. A team member in the team recently asked me whether he can be involved in "playing" with some of the new tools we may be adopting if all goes to plan. However, just today I checked some of this work and the "ordinary" or "boring" work was not done well or completed. These items would include IDS / SIEM monitoring, quarterly access reviews, SOX documentation updates etc. To a certain extent, I understand as I too considered these tasks to be boring and mundane when I used to be a junior. However, these are necessary. I agree that experimenting with new tools is more exciting, but I can't assign these types of tasks to the team until I see basic tasks are done and done well. Other than saying just "get the work done" because it needs to be done, how do I tell the team the importance of "ordinary / boring work? 

The behavior of this person towards you is unacceptable, unprofessional, and most likely violates your companies policies on conduct Documentation is your best friend. Document subsequent attempts of his harassment. Specific and important information to capture includes the following: 

Everywhere I have worked over the past 35+ years, from startups to huge companies, many of them SaaS or SaaS-like, all have had commissioned sales folks. I have seen Sales teams broken down into "Phone Sales" and "Outside Sales". The phone sales folks had a significantly lower commission base than the outside sales folks (since it took far less work to land a phone sale). Even there though, they did have a commission. 

Assuming your contract said "If you leave early you must pay back 50% of the relocation expenses" rather than "If you leave early you must pay back XXXX euros", you should pay back 50% of the actual expenses. Unless you have reason to believe that the expenses given to you in the breakdown are incorrect (and you should check), then whatever the estimates were aren't relevant. It would work the same way if the actuals came out less than the estimates, too. You can be disappointed, but you really can't expect to pay less because the estimate wasn't completely accurate. 

You could always insist that they include the incentive plan in the offer letter if you are that uncomfortable. Decide ahead of time what you will do if they refuse (accept anyway? walk away?). You could also print out the email and have them sign it. But I doubt any of that is really necessary. If it were me, I'd save a copy of both the offer letter and the email detailing incentive plan eligibility and feel okay about it.
