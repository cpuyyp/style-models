Somewhere around 5000-5400 K (as opposed to the Sun's effective surface temperature of ~5700K) would probably do it. Such a star would be straddling the dividing line between G-class "yellow dwarfs" (they aren't yellow) and K-class "orange dwarfs", and would probably hover somewhere around 60% or 70% of the Sun's luminosity (= light output, or close enough for government work) depending on a variety of factors. However, if you just replaced the Sun with an orange dwarf the Earth would freeze, so there's that. It's also worth pointing out that staring at the Sun is dangerous because our ancestors never had to evolve structures that would allow them to do so. This being worldbuilding and not astronomy, it's perfectly conceivable for a species to have developed the ability to stare at a much, much brighter star than the Sun, even, if they had a reason to. 

For starters, the iodine in salt is artificially added. It takes one of four typical forms: potassium iodide, sodium iodide, potassium iodate, and sodium iodate. It seems that humans can process elemental iodine just fine (unlike, say, nitrogen); presumably these four are chosen for having good physical properties for salt adding. It's also found in various foods: seafood and certain vegetables, chiefly. Like many nonmetals, iodine is mainly found in the Earth's crust in the form of various compounds - sodium iodide is a major one. So you could in theory take that, grind it up, and put it in your salt and it would be just fine. (In practice, it's usually reduced to pure iodine first, so that we can be sure there aren't trace elements in it.) Iodines is iodines - once refined, its source is irrelevant. In common with virtually every other important nutrient, too much iodine - whether in pure or salt form - can be hazardous or deadly. More than about 2 grams of pure iodine would be dangerous to a human. 

The problem, as I understand it, is axles. There's no way for a living creature to have an axle as part of its body - it would need blood vessels and nerves, both of which would be twisted by spinning. And if the axle is nonliving (say some kind of secretion, or keratinous growth) it wouldn't be able to form complex shapes, and would be rather brittle. To say nothing of how painful the spinning would be, with all the creature's weight on it. Your point about finding a wheel is an interesting twist - you could imagine a creature that runs around the inside of a free wheel, like one of those hamster balls. You might even posit that the wheels are picked up, hermit-crab-like, from another species (presumably molluscoid) that happens to grow in that shape. The problem there would be coasting - if the creature stopped running, they'd be carried back along the wheel until they fell off or their weight brought it to a halt. In theory, you could have a wheel in two sections, an inner and outer ring, linked by ratchets - it would spin freely in one direction but not the other, so you could run around the inner ring to get the outer one up to speed, then sit back and let it ratchet down. I have to imagine it wouldn't be all that efficient, mechanically, and it would be very fragile because of all the fine teeth. There's always the hoop snake, of course, which (mythically - it's not a real beast) curls itself into a loop and rolls downhill. But one feels that's cheating somehow... and it wouldn't work, of course. Sadly, I think in terms of pure efficiency, walking has rolling beat for animals. 

Building a SSTO spaceplane out of a 747 with current technology would just be flatly impossible. The key value is the mass fraction of your propulsion - which basically is what percentage of the takeoff weight is not fuel, and what part of that weight is payload as opposed to vehicle. An SSTO vehicle needs to be about 90% fuel by mass. (Staged rockets can be less fuel by mass, which is why we use them.) Needless to say the 747 is not designed to hold nine times its dry mass in fuel. So let's assume this is your second scenario: that a futuristic space place is for whatever (presumably cultural) reason shaped like a 747. Because you don't have a specific technology in mind, I think it's more reasonable to look at what you would need. First, thrust (and fuel). As mentioned above, you need your thrust mechanism - whatever it is - to be a lot more fuel-efficient than any existing design. (Glancing over its specs, the 747 only carries about its own weight in fuel at maximum load, so you need to be ~10x as efficient as current drives... or some kind of science-fictiony reactionless drive.) Making the engines small enough to fit in its engine cowlings is probably going to be the easy part. Second, the underlying structure. By that I mean: the 747 is propelled from its wings; all of the thrust originates there, and the wings transfer it to the body. An SSTO design generates vastly more thrust; the wings need to be strong enough not to snap. (They also need to be strong enough not to be broken off on reentry, but I suspect that's a lower threshold than liftoff thrust.) Third: it needs to be able to maneuver. Given everything else, a small version of whatever your thruster is to serve as an RCS system probably isn't a big deal. The 474's own flight surfaces of course won't work in space. Fourth: on reentry, you need to soak an immense amount of heat (unless you have such a phenomenal amount of fuel that you can reenter slowly). Whatever the skin of the plane is made of, it will need to be tough enough to withstand that. It will also need protection from micrometeorites and what have you. It'll need strong materials for the cockpit windscreen, etc. All of this has been assuming that you want the internal layout to be basically identical. If you were going to hollow out the cabin and cargo hold and turn them all into fuel tanks, it's not quite so implausible, but I think the wings are still shaped wrong, and the heat shield will still be an issue. 

It might be "cheaper". By that I mean - every capacity a body has, every organ or gland or limb or what have you, is something it needs to build up as a child and sustain as an adult. This takes resources: energy, proteins, trace minerals. The less a creature "spends" on its reproductive system, the more it can spend on other systems, like its skeleton, or its muscles, or its brain. I don't know how much more efficient your species would run if they each had a single gender. If it's a non-trivial amount, I would expect them to select away from hermaphrodites in the first place. In a wide-ranging species, you might see different selection pressures in different areas, such that in some places having discrete genders is favored and in other places it isn't. In the absence of such a variation, I'd expect that one or the other strategy would become predominant and the other would eventually fade. (Although that does take time - you could conceivably set your story in the interim, while the species is changing.)
