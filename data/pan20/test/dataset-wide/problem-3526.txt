Your daily protein intake is very high and very good already.I don't think you need to add another protein shake as you are right now and probably not in the near future as well. Regarding the problems you mentioned it is a a problems that varies from person to person.I personally don't have any digestion problems no matter how many shakes i take but again this depends on each person.So the only way to find out is to try it yourself and see how your body reacts. In conclusion,you do not need anymore protein intake right now and you probably won't need for another year or so.Just keep working out and results will come.Protein is not everything carbs fats and fiber are also important.As long as you keep a caloric surplus and you eat 120-150 gr of protein everyday you will be seeing great results in the near future. 

As mentioned in the comments the abs are just like any other muscle in our body.Yes,their shape depends on our genetics and there is no way to change that but their size can be changed. To achieve that you just need to train your abs just like any other muscle for hypetrophy because you can also have strong abs but not aesthetically beautiful (ex powerlifters,strongmen etc). Now,assuming you already have both strong and "big" abs all you got to do is lose some fat and let them unveal.This might sound simple but it requires a lot of effort with diet and tracking your macros. 

Convict conditioning book presents very effective progressions for multiple exercises including pistol squats.The first progression is always pretty easy, even the weakest athletes can perform it without trouble. As you progress you will move to a harder progression. The 10th step in every exercise is called the master step. In squats the master step is the pistol squats. This book is really helpful in bodyweight training. Cheatsheet available here, book available here What step to start with ? This depends on your level of fitness and the strength of your muscles and joints. Just begin with a challenging exercise that you can perform and keep adding reps until you meet the progression standard in the book then move to the next step in the series. 

Pressups on fingers are great to strengthen your fingers besides thickening your wrists and forearms. They won't cause any form of arthritis if you do them properly. The only precaution to take is to be completely sure that your fingers are strong enough to let you attempt the exercise. If not, try doing an easier exercise like kneeling pressups or incline pressups. This is the right hand position (The image is taken from Convict conditioning 2 ) : I've had the same issue before. And by doing fingertip pressups and hanging exercises that I found in Convict conditioning 2 book, I made my entire forearm thicker and more muscular. I really recommend having a look at these exercises in the book mentioned above. Source : Personal experience :) 

There have been dozens of questions asked about the best way to maximize muscle mass. Consistently, the highest rated answer suggests focusing on whole-body compound exercises like squats, deadlifts, bench presses, and shoulder presses instead of split routines. Routines like StrongLifts 5x5 or Starting Strength, it is argued, will produce much greater strength and mass gains than a split routine. I was wondering if there is any actual research to confirm compound exercises are more effective at muscle hypertrophy than split routines. I'm all for the simplicity of Starting Strength, but I always feel like I need to add in bicep curls or tricep extensions in order to feel like I'm getting the most out of my workout. 

I have access to a standard gym in Africa, and will be here for one year. What program or combination of programs would provide the largest physique changes for when I return to the states? 

I hear a lot of advocacy of squats as a method for producing testosterone and human growth hormone as part of exercise-induced muscle hypertrophy. I cannot, however, find any academic research on this question outside of anecdotal evidence. Is there any research to suggest that squats are the most effective exercise at producing hGH and testosterone? What other exercises do this? **Note, I am not skeptical of the claim that the total work done during a particular exercise is related to hGH output-- I am skeptical of the claim that squats are significantly MORE effective than other exercises at inducing higher postexercise hGH blood levels. I am wondering if there is evidence explicating the degree to which certain compound exercises contribute to blood-serum hGH levels. 

Actually you can't do 2 things at the same time. You have to choose between strength and endurance you can't do both. Best thing you can do is to firstly get rid of the resistance band and start doing strict full ROM pull ups and dips. When you get 12-15 reps at each you can start doing weighted dips and pull ups. That will increase your endurance as well. But not as much and fast as if you were doing specific endurance training P.S You can try adding to your routine some scapula pulls its a great exercise and it's most of the times what is missing from taking your pulls ups to the next level. 

Working out too hard can overload the hormonal system. You can produce too much cortisol, which elevates inflammation and depletes testosterone. It can take months to recover from real overtraining, but you're probably not overtrained. However, sleep, nutrition and certain supplements can keep you from being overtaxed and prevent burnout. Overtraining Is Rare, But Overtaxing Isn't Could you be overtrained? The demon that swallows gains and destroys motivation? Overtraining is a very rare and misunderstood phenomenon. But you could be overtaxing your body and its key systems. There is a study which showed a significant drop in testosterone, and a nice boost in stress hormone cortisol. Time to exhaustion was also way faster than what it was prior to overtraining. Remember that these problems are not short term, they can last for weeks and weeks if you decide to overtrain. So there you go. Overtraining does exist and the threshold to that is different and it varies from people to people. And if you do find out that you’ve overtrained… Then seriously just take a solid week or two weeks off to begin recovering from overtraining. Let your body rest properly and don’t let that condition go chronic. 

I've already mastered leg raises on the floor and I was advised to progress to a harder variation of leg raises which is the hanging knee raises. The problem is that my shoulders and lats give up before my abs do. So, after about 8 reps of hanging knee raises I give up due to pain in my shoulders and lats despite keeping my shoulders tight. I can't do pull ups yet but I'm working on it. Can the lack of strength in my lats and biceps cause this issue ? and if not, then, What causes this pain and how can I overcome this issue ? 

I started working out and I'm doing only bodyweight exercises with progressions from convict conditioning book. The workout routine in this book was not intense enough for me. I read on many websites that I, as a beginner, should train each muscle group 3 times per week. So, I alternate between muscle groups every other day. My workout routine is as follows: M/W/F: Pull ups & squats 3 sets per exercise T/T/S: Push ups & leg raises 3 sets per exercises and sunday is off. So, does this routine overtrain my body ? 

I've been following a bodyweight training routine for 2 months now and I'm satisfied with the gains until now. I am training to improve how I look, and I've succeeded till now except for my shoulder. My collar bone is very visible and it makes me look very skinny despite being in a good shape. Some people told me that my upper chest needs some workout. I don't know if it was true. So, what muscle do I have to train to make it less visible ? Please, suggest some workouts for the upper chest if it was the muscle that I have to train. I do only bodyweight exercises. 

The beauty of the farmer's walk is its simplicity. You can add it to any training program and make the program better. I'll do some version of a loaded carry at the end of every strength training workout. Here's an example of how they could be built into a program: Day 1 – Push Day. Add one set of standard farmer's walks. Day 2 – Pull Day. Add one set of single-arm farmer's walks. Day 3 – Leg Day. Add one set of uneven farmer's walks, a different weight in each hand. The goal every week is to increase load or duration of the set. Week 1 – Walk 25 feet up and back 3 times Week 2 – Walk 30 feet up and back 3 times Week 3 – Increase the weight and walk 25 feet Week 4 – Walk 30 feet with the heavier weight Be sure to note your numbers and your distance and try to improve on it weekly. Every week I rotate the type of farmer's carry, alternating from handles to kettlebells to fat-grip dumbbells. Training variety is endless. However, the key to success in the farmer's walk is not in the walking, but how you walk with the weight. In conclusion it is not the best warm up exercise there are other exercises way better for warming up but that also depends on the program you are following.If you are doing powerlifting you won't warm up with farmer's walk.
