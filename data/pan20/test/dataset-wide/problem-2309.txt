You can't tell by looking, and it's an issue that occurs naturally, not just because of industrial contamination. Even if you're hiking in a pristine environment like a national park, where this kind of man-made contamination isn't likely to be a concern, there can still be contamination from naturally occurring substances like arsenic. Natural blue-green algae can also produce toxins that can make you sick, and treatment will not get rid of the toxins. Even after an algae bloom has died off, the toxins can remain in the water if it's stagnant, so there is no way of telling by looking at the water that there's a problem with toxins. All you can do to protect yourself is avoid drinking from stagnant water sources. In an environment that's not pristine, such as farm country, industrial contamination is only one of many possible hazards. You have to worry about contamination from livestock and fertilizers, and so on. Again, you can't tell by looking at it whether it's contaminated. Some common-sense precautions: 

Of course you want to try simple things first, and waiting is a really simple thing to do. She solved the problem in 15 minutes, which doesn't even seem like an especially long time to me to wait for a second to do a pitch. It could take that long to clean a stuck piece of gear. Another simple solution would be to bring radios in the future, but that doesn't help you in this case. I assume you didn't each have a cell phone in your pack. If you've exhausted the simple options (say it's been an hour and nothing is happening), this becomes more of a self-rescue situation, and self-rescue is based on improvising a solution using the gear you have and the techniques you know. Often in self-rescue, lowering the climber is the easiest solution. It would have worked here, but you had no way of knowing that, and it could have been dangerous to lower. So... If you were giving her a direct belay, then tying off the belay is trivial. If you were belaying off of your harness, then you need to know how to escape the belay, which is an important and fundamental self-rescue skill to practice. If you had less than half the rope out, then you could rappel down on a second strand to see what was up. However, you would need to formulate a plan to make sure you could get back up without having to solo the route, e.g., using a Prusik. The decision whether to attempt this might depend on the difficulty of the route. Because you can't extract your belay device from the system, you would need to do the rappel using an alternate technique such as a Munter. Another option might be to go and get help. Obviously that has disadvantages, but it beats attempting a self-rescue by a sketchy method that might get you killed. One of the basic rules of first aid and self-rescue is not to create additional victims. 

They're not very easy to activate. Here's a video showing how to activate the one I own. It's a multi-step process. You have to flip up a tab (which I think involves cracking a thin plastic connection), use the tab to pull off the cover, unfurl the antenna, and then press the on button, which is hidden until you get the cover off. Anyway, I did find a description here of what happened when a skier accidentially activated his. Apparently he had his PLB in his pocket during a ski run, and somehow knocked the cover off, didn't realize that the cover was off, and then the "on" button got pressed. Seems like a very unlikely sequence of events, but I guess out of some large number of users, freak accidents like this are going to happen. What happened next in his case was that the Air Force called his wife, his wife called him on his cell phone, and they were able to straighten things out over the phone. He wasn't fined or thrown in jail. Presumably the Air Force called his home phone because he'd supplied that phone number when he registered the unit. If you accidentally activate it somewhere that you can't be contacted by phone, then I don't see any way for them to distinguish that from a real emergency. The most serious consequences would then be for whoever's trying to rescue you. If it's a volunteer search and rescue team, then they have to leave work, roll out of bed or whatever, head off into the wilderness, and possibly put themselves in danger searching for you. It's very common for search and rescue teams to get hurt, especially in mountain environments. You want to be very careful not to put these folks in danger unnecessarily. There are probably two reasonable options if you do activate it unnecessarily and don't have phone contact. (1) You could hike out to where you can get phone service and prevent a search from being initiated. (2) You could stay put and make it easy for them to find you. This is what is usually advised in an actual emergency: just stay put. 

Because there is zero evidence for essentially any of the manufacturers' claims, it's not a good idea to pay more than you have to. Buy cheap running shoes. If you're trying to run fast and competitively, buy lighter shoes. But do not suddenly switch from very heavily cushioned shoes to minimalist shoes, because the sudden switch may not allow your body to adapt quickly enough. 

When you're lead climbing, the most common way for the rope to hang naturally, if you don't do anything special, is usually between your legs. Is this OK on rock? On ice? Why or why not? On rock, the impression I get is that it's fine, as long as you don't back-step the rope. I have heard people in the gym tell people not to do it, but I suspect they're either wrong or oversimplifying. Flipping through some rock climbing videos on youtube, I pretty quickly came across examples of extremely skilled sport climbers with the rope in this position, e.g., $URL$ . On ice, are you supposed to keep the rope over one thigh because it makes it less likely that you'll damage it with your crampons or get your crampon points tangled in it? I've had a small amount of instruction and experience ice climbing, but I don't do it often enough to remember much of the technique from one time to the next. 

Snakes are usually harmless. This is their habitat, and you shouldn't be intentionally trying to scare them off. Just don't worry about it. 

I'm not super experienced with snow anchors, but basically a snow bollard can be a bomber anchor if the snow is hard -- hard enough that you have to use an ice ax to chop the trench. You can back it up using one or more objects such as ice axes or pickets, to make it more difficult for the anchor to fail by having the rope cheese-grater itself through the snow. You will need to remove these before the last person raps off, so usually the lightest person raps off last. A snow bollard is actually a stronger anchor than a dead-man or picket, but it will be very time-consuming to construct. In soft or fresh snow, a picket can be made at least somewhat strong by filling in the trench with snow and working the snow; however, I would not want to rappel off of one, especially if it wasn't redundant. I believe a snow bollard is more commonly used as a rappel anchor, because it's strong. Because you're rapping off of it, you can't fill in the trench with snow as you would with a picket, because then you wouldn't be able to pull the rope down. Even though you're not filling in the trench, one of my main worries about using a bollard would be that there would be too much friction to pull it down, especially if the rope entrenches itself in the snow where it goes over a ledge. 

This is not a complete answer to my own question, but the following may be relevant. The book by Long and Gaines on climbing anchors says this: 

I'll give this a shot, but I'm from the US, and although I've done a little bit of mountaineering in the Alps, I've never done Mont Blanc. Others may be able to give better answers. First, you need to buy an ice ax, crampons, and crampon-compatible boots. This is going to be expensive, and it is possible to rent gear in Chamonix, but IMO it's just not practical to work your way up to the level of skill needed for Mont Blanc without owning gear and using it quite a bit. Finding usable, well-fitting crampon-compatible boots can be a hard process. Don't satisfy yourself with boots that give you blisters. For Mont Blanc in summer, I think you probably want leather/synthetic boots (not double plastic boots) such as La Sportiva Evos, which will set you back about 300 pounds. The shape and design of that particular boot happens to work well for my foot, but you need to figure out what works for you. Next, get professional instruction in snow travel and self-arrest, or get instruction through a mountaineering club or from an experienced friend who's willing to devote a full day to it. From googling, it looks like there are courses available in Scotland. Although you're going guided, there are certain physical skills for snow travel that you need to practice and get in your muscle memory. For example, I've often seen people descending on low-angle snow at an extremely slow pace because they lack confidence and the physical skill. They do things like sitting down and inch-worming their way down the slope, or they laboriously use the ice ax in cane position when they could just be plunge-stepping or boot glissading. So you need to practice these skills. Again, I would guess that you could do stuff in Scotland that would work. These don't need to be big peaks, just anywhere that there's snow and steep slopes. To get really comfortable, you will probably need to spend 10-20 days on snow, experiencing different conditions, higher angles, ice, etc. If I were you, I'd join a mountaineering club in the UK and start going on trips with them, starting with easy stuff. I suspect that most people going guided on this type of climb have zero crevasse self-rescue skills. This may be OK if the route you have in mind on Mont Blanc is wanded and the risk of falling in a crevasse is very small. However, I feel that anyone going into this kind of situation should have self-rescue skills. I know a professional guide who fell into a crevasse while on a two-man rope team with a client. The client didn't respond competently, and the result was serious injuries and a helicopter rescue. Although Scotland apparently has not had any glaciers for hundreds of years, you can get self-rescue training there; rather than practicing in a real crevasse, they would probably use a cliff or something. If you want to train in an area that has real glaciers, big crevasses, and icefalls, I would imagine that you could get that in Norway or Iceland, but I don't really know. 

Although none of the people in the study who had Giardia got symptoms, this rate of infection is many orders of magnitude higher than would have been expected from water contamination based on the Rendroff-Rose data and modeling. Unfortunately the Zell article is paywalled, so I can only see the abstract, but it appears that he would have had no way to tell whether the people who acquired infections got them from contaminated water or from hand-to-mouth contamination. In any case, Zell's conclusion is that water treatment is of marginal cost-effectiveness, given the low risk and the fact that the infection is self-limiting and usually asymptomatic. Another reality check we can do is to compare the concentrations of Giardia in backcountry water with the concentrations in city tap water. This is complicated by the fact that Giardia cysts, whether found in backcountry water or tap water, may be nonviable, and surveys cannot usually determine their viability. Historically, city tap water has been getting cleaner and cleaner, especially in the developed world. However, it appears to have been normal in 20th-century America for city tap water to contain concentrations of Giardia cysts that are similar to or greater than the concentrations found in backcountry areas of the US.[Rockwell 2002] It would be interesting to get more detailed information on this from someone who has professional-level knowledge of US water supplies and their history. A meta-analysis of the literature in 2000 concluded that "the evidence for an association between drinking backcountry water and acquiring giardiasis is minimal."[Welch 2000] When people do actually contract backpacker's diarrhea from exposure during a hiking trip, by far the most common reason is hand-to-mouth contamination.[Welch 1995] Auerbach 2012 - Paul S.
