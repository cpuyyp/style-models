I think it's a fun question, if impossible. The only way to turn Jupiter into a star that's even remotely practical is to add to it's mass. Ignoring brown dwarfs that are very limited in energy output, to get a red dwarf going, you'd need to add at least 75-80 or so Jupiter masses. (a bit more than 24,000 earth masses). You'd want to add a fair percentage of hydrogen, but some rocky debris wouldn't hurt the mix. Anyway, assuming the impossible is done, there's several things to consider. The greater gravity (75-80 times) would significantly alter all the planets orbits. Predicting exactly how is hard, but that much more mass and the planets orbits, certainly all the inner ones, would wobble a lot more and some might get pulled completely out of their orbit, likely thrown out of the solar system. You might think that the planets nearer to Jupiter would be the most affected, but it really has more to do with tidal synch than anything else. Any of the 4 inner planets could get tugged into a new orbit. You'd also likely see the earth's orbit elongate in resonance with Jupiter perhaps increasing the ice age/ice melt cycle. Precise answers are hard, and none of these things would happen over 1 orbit, but over time, certainly. Orbital changes to all the inner planets and perhaps Saturn as well would be inevitable if Jupiter becomes a red-dwarf. Imagine if Saturn was pulled closer to the earth, into an orbit between Mars and Jupiter, or Mercury was pulled out past the earth. Odds are it wouldn't hit us, but we might want to keep an eye on it. $URL$ 2nd thing to consider is magnetism and solar flares. Young stars tend to spin very fast due to conservation of angular momentum when the stars form and this creates enormous magnetic fields and huge solar flares, much bigger than we get from the sun. It's strange to think that a tiny red dwarf, 4 times as far from our sun as the sun would create solar flares to worry about but it's possible. Whether it would need high angular momentum for this to happen, I'm not sure, but we could see larger solar flares from star-Jupiter than from the sun. $URL$ Brightness, heat and visibility was covered above, but I'll touch on that. Brightness of -6.25 would be 5-6 times brighter than Venus and you'd see it at night, Venus isn't seen in peak darkness, so it would be significantly brighter than any other star/planet in the sky, but significantly less bright than the moon, like, you couldn't make your way with just that star's light the way you can see things around you in moonlight. But when I run the numbers, I think it would be quite a bit brighter than that. Mass to Luminosity is to the power of 3.5 - quick estimate, so, lets say the red dwarf has a mass of 80 Jupiters. That's 0.076 Suns. 0.076^3.5 = about 1/8,000, so 4.2 times as far away at closest point (square of that), 1/8000th as bright, we're looking at 1/140,000 times the light we get from the sun - not very much and likely less than that in it's early stages and because the smaller stars tend to fall off, so lets estimate 1/200,000 - 1/300,000 the apparent brightness of the sun as a ballpark estimate. That's not enough to heat the earth at all, but that's still brighter, (a little bit) than the full moon which is about 1/400,000 the brightness of the sun. it would be enough light to see your way around, but I wouldn't want to try to read by it. It would also be distinctly reddish light. Not the white light we're used to getting from the day or night sky. Finally size - a red-dwarf star of 80 Jupiter masses would actually be slightly smaller than Jupiter due to the gravitation so it would appear like a planet - not quite a point in the sky, but almost a point, but a bit brighter than the full moon and red. That's likely bright enough to see during the day too. I don't think it would be hard to look at or hurt your eyes, but it would shine like a tiny bright red flashlight in the distance. $URL$ I don't think I like star-Jupiter. Lets not plan on doing this. :-) 

Isaac Newton was the first to put it together and realized the Earth had an oblate shape in 1687. See 1672 - Wikipedia. In 1666 Robert Hooke reasoned that pendulums could measure variation in gravity, but this remained unobserved until 1671, when Jean Richter observed that pendulums kept different time near the equator (French Guiana compared to Paris). Around that time, 1673, Christian Huygens observed that the wide swing of a pendulum would move in a very slight oval, so to make pendulum clocks more accurate, the swings were kept to a low angle and the swing kept perpenducular That, however, has to do with the Earth's rotation, but not your question specifically. Newton was the first to put it all together that the observed gravitational fluctuation was due to the equatorial bulge and faster speed of rotation near the equator. Article here also credits him with being the first. Also, related: $URL$ 

A long string doesn't make any sense. A temporarily non-round event horizon as the holes merge seems possible, but think of a merger of 2 stretched balls, not a string. Each black hole is centered around it's "singularity", those shapes might warp some as the holes collide or spiral into each other. As an FYI, direct collisions would be rare. Spiraling into each other is much more common. The kinetic energy gets absorbed inside the black hole. It can't, by definition of the black hole, escape. Total momentum is likely preserved. 

There's a strong correlation between the Milankovich cycles and the length of recent ice ages, so the answer here is yes, if you were able to adjust the "numbers" then the length of ice ages would change accordingly. The 3 Milankovich cycles combine into two primary patterns, the 40,000 year cycle and the 100,000 year cycle (more on that shortly). These were observed first by geologists and later tied to Milankovich cycles. What starts and stops ice ages is complicated and there's a few moving parts, so there's not 100% consensus on Milankovich cycles driving ice ages, but the correlation is strong and as far as I've read, this idea is largely agreed upon. Ice age Cycles From about 2.3 million years ago to about 800,000 years ago, the 40,000 year ice age cycle was dominant, and for the last 800,000 years, the 100,000 year cycle has been dominant. The 40,000 year cycle is thought to be the stronger of the two, and one theory as to why the 100,000 year cycle became dominant 800,000 years ago is that the Earth grew slightly cooler, perhaps with the glaciation of Greenland. See 100,000 year problem. The 40,000 year cycle still plays a role even within the 100,000 year cycle currently the dominant one. Article on that here. Axial tilt. Axial tilt is on a pretty consistent 41,040 year cycle and it's strongly tied to the arguably somewhat misnamed, 40,000 year cycle. Axial tilt is the cause of seasons on Earth, so when the Axial tilt is high (over 24 degrees), the seasonal variation increases, meaning, warmer summers and colder winters on both hemispheres. When it's low (below 23), it means more mild seasons. While this doesn't change how much sunlight hits the earth, it does change climate on Earth for other reasons, The overall result is that the more mild seasons lead to a cooler earth.

If the highest is 0.0679 and the variations are 0.012 and up to 0.03, that's over 50% variation peak to peak. That's amplitude, not period, but if we look at the chart it's clearly not a neat and tidy cycle though it's somewhat close to a 100,000 year period (top line on the chart below). 

Hurricanes could theoretically form as a result of fluid dynamics, but the rapid rate that partially ionized helium radiates heat makes the formation of large circulating structures, which are basically engines of convection, impractical and unnecessary. There's no need for efficient convection when the energy transfer is very efficient by radiation. The Sun's atmosphere isn't like the atmosphere of the Earth and in the upper layers of Jupiter where the atmosphere is fairly effective and holding onto it's heat (We wouldn't have warm and cold fronts if it wasn't). Those regions of warm and cold air that mostly maintain their temperature drive the convective process. You need jets of warm and cold air to flow past each other in a hurricane. The Sun's efficient radiation of partially ionized helium works against that principal. There's also a relatively low Coriolis effect on the surface of the sun, which assists with the formation of hurricanes. In short, the conditions are not at all right. The Sun's turbulence, it's relatively low rotation rate, no phase-change to feed the system and it's partially ionized helium in it's lower "atmosphere", all work against the formation of spiraling, cone shaped, high speed wind systems. On Brown dwarfs with much cooler surface temperatures, hurricanes might be entirely possible. The math behind atmospheric convection mechanisms is complicated, so this is more of a general explanation but the Sun isn't a good candidate for hurricanes on many levels.
