The ISO file itself is not small - over 7GB. But the folder is huge - 19GB, which are added to the same content of the ISO. My question - do I really need to keep this 26GB if I want to have a silent install of VS2015? Is it safe to delete the folder? And if it is, 19GB is still an awful lot. Is there a more space efficient way to arrange the silent install? 

Problem - I have Logstash running on 13 different servers and I have no idea what is the current CPU and memory consumption of these java processes. Sure, I can open Perfmon and connect to these 13 different servers and show the different performance counters ... in theory. In practice, it is hardly the way. So, what is the way? How is it done sanely? 

I do not have much experience with Mercurial, so I find it really hard to decide which option is the best. Can anyone advise, please? EDIT I have now realized that my question exposes my total misunderstanding of the push command. Of course, I do not mean . What I really meant by REV is BRANCH, so the options should read: 

The Save button is disabled. I do not understand how to advance from there. EDIT 2 I could not find the "the big blue button that says “add the selected performance counters”" I can see a small blue button with the + sign, pressing which I get the following: 

EDIT3 I have just checked - the vm-host is able to ssh to the vm machine! I still do not know how to leverage this discovery to solve the problem. 

I have a file in an Azure File storage. I would like to download it using a DSC resource (, for example). The Azure File storage gives me an HTTPS url to that file, but it is not directly usable: 

Place the PFX file in an Azure File Storage and obtain the SAS token. Add the credentials to the PFX file as an Azure Automation Asset Use the following DSC configuration to ensure the certificate is installed: 

I have uploaded a PFX file to the Azure Automation account - it is now a certificate asset over there. Now, I would like to have a DSC configuration that ensures this certificate is present in the LOCAL_MACHINE\My store on the target machine and its private key is accessible by a certain domain user. I found the resource, but it is unclear to me how I can use it. Any ideas? EDIT 1 My current solution is as follows: 

I think I have finally figured out what is going on, though I am yet to check whether this will help me to install SSMS using Azure Automation DSC. Here is what I have done: 

Apparently I am missing the source for certain windows features. Does it mean I must provide the location of some kind of an installation disk? And that this disk must be available for as long as this configuration is active? Can the source be some Microsoft download URL? 

So, which one is the correct one? Is there a more deterministic way of coping with the insanity of deducing the right product Id? 

The Azure Automation DSC seems to know to integrate with GitHub, but it seems to expect only runbooks there. At least, this is what I understand from the following UI screen: 

There is, however, a problem - the certificate is left on the target machine. I would like to avoid it. One idea could be instead of copying the certificate to share the Azure File Storage container having the PFX file and install it from the share, but then the share remains permanently mounted on the target machine - essentially the same problem. I am looking for a way to ensure the certificate is present without leaving a trace. I thought I could add a resource with Ensure = "Absent" and make it depend on the PfxImport resource, but then how will it work? Will it constantly download the certificate, ensure it is installed (it would be) and then delete it again? Doing this every 30 minutes? Is this the right approach? 

Renamed SSMS-Setup-ENU.exe to SSMS-Setup-ENU.zip Peeked inside. The only text file is named "0" and this is an XML file. The very first element is from which I concluded that the exe was created with WIX burn. Renamed the file back. Found $URL$ Downloaded and extracted wix311-binaries.zip from $URL$ Ran , which extracted a lot of msi files from SSMS-Setup-ENU.exe to . Found $URL$ Saved the PowerShell script from the answer and modified it a bit to ease the piping (the script code is below). Piped all the msis through the script and identified the two msis with the Product Codes in question. 

Next, I have no idea how to push to a different branch. For instance, a developer works in the default branch and wishes to backup its local commits to the special backup repository shared by all the other devs. Of course, this backup repository is not the one from which developers pull the new changes. Anyway, the backup needs to go to a branch dedicated to that particular dev, as stated per options 2. How do I do it? How can I tell push that the changes are pushed to a different branch? 

However, I would like to check first if there is a non SSD drive and if present install it there. As I understand it, I cannot use Powershell code, because that code runs during compilation. I need it to run during the configuration. How do I do it? 

It is unclear to me how Azure Automation DSC can allow for such coupling. Sometimes just the account name is needed (to configure Sql Server), but sometimes the resource must be run as the owner, i.e. the owner credentials are needed. Unless there is a way for a DSC resource to run as the workstation owner without knowing owner's credentials. In short, it seems to me that Azure Automation DSC cannot be used to configure developer machines. And I am not even talking about shortage of out of the box and tested DSC resources like: 

So, both product codes are found in the same SSMS installation and correspond to sql_ssms.msi and sql_ssms_loc.msi. Both have the same Product Name - SQL Server Management Studio. Now, I have no idea what is sql_ssms_loc.msi, but I am going to try and use F8ADD24D-F2F2-465C-A675-F12FDB70DB82, because it corresponds to sql_ssms.msi. Will be back with the results. EDIT 1 Using F8ADD24D-F2F2-465C-A675-F12FDB70DB82 seems to have worked. 

The machine is located in the amazon cloud. Worth to mention, that when ran as root the server works as expected. Any ideas? Thanks. P.S. Adding the authbind option or java property makes no difference. EDIT I have installed tomcat6. It listens on port 8080. I can wget its index page locally, but not from the outside using the DNS provided name of the machine. However, if I change its port from 8080 to 11111, then I can get to it from the outside. Which means, that the tomcat server behaves exactly like my own with respect to this issue. 

My question is how can I configure the proxy settings, including the credentials using a more up-to-date tool? EDIT I would like to stress that I am looking for a command line utility to do that. 

Note the line in the output. This is the same account I am using when logged on interactively to the remote machine, which is an XP virtual machine running on a Windows 7 box. The account is a local admin, of course. Now, running the same signtool command from a console window (from an RDP session) works just fine, but when Jenkins tries to execute it, I get this delegation error message. Another piece of information. The relevant process tree is: 

I am trying to create a DSC configuration for a developer workstation and facing difficulties. A developer machine has a well defined owner - the developer who is going to get it. Some configurations tightly coupled to the owner account: 

I would like it to display '% Processor Time' instead of CounterValue. However, I cannot use , since the desired title contains spaces. So, how do I do it? 

How is it possible that I have full control of this folder, but still cannot browse its contents? P.S. I need to fix it, because this is why I suspect the following command fails: 

The problem is with the vm-host. Although, it should be transparent for the SSH communication going to the guest machine (aka vm), for some unknown reason it is not. So, I had to install OpenSSH (via cygwin) on vm-host as well, even though I am not planning to access it via SSH. Once I have installed OpenSSH on vm-host I was able to access vm (the guest machine). How installing OpenSSH on the host machine solves the access problems to the guest - I have no idea. 

The motivation is that I would like to know if the failure notifications pile up, but counting them in the GUI is insane, I would like to script it. 

I used ssh-host-config both on vm and srv to configure the ssh to run as a windows service. Besides that I did nothing else. Can anyone help me troubleshoot this issue? Thank you very much. EDIT The virtual machine software is VMWare Workstation 7.1.4. I think the problem is in its settings, but I have no idea where exactly. The Network Adapter is set to Bridged. EDIT2 All the machines are located in the company lab, I think all of them are on the same segment, but I may be wrong. Below is the output for each machine (skipping the linux server). I have deleted the Tunnel adapters to keep the output minimal. If anyone thinks they matter, do tell so and I will post them as well. In addition ping output is given to show that DNS is correct. Something else, may be relevant, may be not. Doing to srv works OK, whereas to vm failes with Access Denied. srv:
