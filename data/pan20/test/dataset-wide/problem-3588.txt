The higher intensity of 'push' in each stride manifests itself in acceleration. That is the variable your are considering, not speed itself. What you call 'running power' simply implies reaching a specific speed faster. The 'end' force you have to constantly apply to maintain that effective speed is the same, no matter how fast you reached it earlier. In synthesis; football players do almost all of their running in constant acceleration, where as running athletes on medium or long distances reach their pace and keep it for several minutes to hours. The speed the football player has reached before a tackle however must not necessarily be higher than the speed of a track and field athlete running the mile. 

It's actually a very normal feeling. It's not even comparable to other purely psychological addictions(like internet), because physical activity induces a secretion of endorphines. If the activity is intense, and lifting heavy weights falls under that category, the amount released is proportionally higher. I have experienced the same feeling you described. I remember a few years ago I twisted my right ankle 2 times in one year - I had to quit sports for 6 weeks, and then build up gradually. I actually turned to alcohol to stop that nauseating and depressing feeling. I drank regularly much like an alcoholic, at least a liter of beer a day, often more than three (starting at lunch). When I recovered I stopped drinking as quick as I began. This of course add's up with the normal 'pull' to do the things we enjoy doing. It's a craving feeling, that can get so strong as to provoke debilitating symptoms during withdrawal. The entire concept of addiction is very complicated and equally interesting, the dilemma about when an activity or a substance (not just drugs but also chocolate, ice cream, sparkling water) is to be considered a negative addiction will probably never be solved. You have to evaluate if the activity has any negative impacts on your life. Sports doesn't really fall into that category, so I wouldn't worry too much about it. However you may have noticed that it's more difficult to maintain a social life outside work and the gym, because you spend so much time there. Also having a relationship might not be so easy. Fortunately in my experience the more sports I do, the less I feel the need to sleep. That really compensates for the time spent cycling or lifting weights. Of course, everything depends on you perspective on life. I am sure you'll even find doctors that can diagnose some psychological disorder just because you love working out to the extent where you feel bad without it. 

Don't ever do max weight when you don't feel comfortable with the motion of an exercise! As a matter of fact don't do weights at all. Here is what you do: Lay down on the bench, take a bar or a long wooden stick and practice! Do 1000 bench presses with no weights every day, and you will feel a difference. If you don't, do 2000. Ask a pro at the gym to watch your form while you do them, they know stuff and it obviously worked for them. Don't stop this until three or four successful athletes tell your your doing good(they will be glad to share knowledge and help you). The reason why repeating the motion will help you is neurological: the neurologic paths used by the motion will be 'strengthened' with use, your coordination for that specific motion will increase, and it will start to feel natural to you. When I started boxing my trainer would make me step and jab for 50 minutes every evening. Gradually he added more complex footwork and other punches. I did this for hours because I trusted him. It was worth it, I can now throw a punch at any time, and I know my feet are in the right place and balanced. It has become a primal movement. Of course with your bench it is less extreme.. a couple of days, maybe two weeks and you will feel substantial improvement already. You have to realize that it's not about what is fun and enjoyable - not in the beginning. It will be boring and often frustrating(with no weights at all form is often more difficult to maintain), but sometimes this is necessary for you to stay healthy and have a good performance later on. You will need to stay focused. Pauses during the 1000 presses of course are allowed(even the bar alone get's heavy). Don't be one of those people who think they can just jump in the gym and lift or run or cycle like a pro. Pace yourself, accept the difficulties, dedicate the necessary time and eventually your bench will work out too. 

If we take Tabatas specifically, I'm not sure there's been anything large studied showing 20/10 to be superior to other methods of HIIT. I think the Tabata name is a red herring though, as interval training was done long before Tabata conducted his study, and if you look at the history he didn't discover anything new. So the 20 seconds on, 10 seconds off isn't a magical number or ratio, it was selected to keep the study controlled. More than half a century ago, several track and field world records were set by athletes using high intensity interval training. I'm lead to believe Lance Armstrong also does interval training. I'd think its use by some of the world's best athletes for at least the past 75 years would be more of an endorsement than a study involving even 50 or 100 people. I'm not sure about doing exclusively HIIT, but I think it's a safe bet that including it in your training regimen is better than not including it. 

I can't do comments yet, so I'll have to do an answer instead. I was going to say mostly what Sancho did, but also add to take more rest days. Stronglifts 5x5 and Texas Method suggest working out 3x/week, which I'll admit is quite appealing, but I've found I have to take 2-3 rest days, really with the best results when my schedul forces me to not hit the weights for 3 days. Muscle gain comes mostly in your sleep, and otherwise when you're not doing much. Lifting weights only promotes it, but you have to let your body do it then. Also, reduce your workout so it fits within 30 minutes, that'll be a good constraint to address what Sancho talked about with efficiency. 

I just do one set of 5 at between 1/3 to 1/2 my work set for warmup*. I used to do 3 warmup sets of gradually escalating weight, but I haven't found that's any better than just doing one. If you want to play it safe, do a couple more sets, and when you feel comfortable with it you can start scaling back. *I also take a hot Epsom-salt bath before heading to the gym, that may help with warmups, but I find the benefit is actually in my lifts, as I'm able to lift significantly heavier weights after doing it. 

A treadmill won't prepare you for the impact of running for real. If the (half) marathon is in the desert and you're running through the sand then the problem you'd run into is fatigue. If (much more likely) the (half) marathon is on the road, you'll be in for a really nasty surprise. Also, unless you're planning on running somewhere quite different from where you live, you'll want to acclimatize yourself to the environment, which means getting used to running in the desert heat. If you insist on training only on a treadmill, don't do a full marathon. Half is the most, and even then you'll be in for a nasty experience, as the treadmill really won't prepare you. 

Physical withdrawal for the sense of well being that comes with natural endorphines. The intense craving for an activity simply because you enjoy it (this point is not to be underrated). 

Get a heavy boxing sack, some bandages and gloves. Then I suggest to do following exercise. -> warmup, then: 

Hit the sack lightly on your feet for a minute. Stay distant, move all the time. after 50 sec drop to floor and go all in for push ups. Do them for 20 seconds. jump up and while skipping in place as fast as you can hit the sack as fast as you can (very short range, and almost no power, just speed). Do this for 10 seconds. Last 30 seconds of the second minute punch the sack as hard as you can. Plant your feet and beat the sand out of it. repeat at will 

Your chest will feel like it explodes during step number 3 especially. Number 1 is a bit of rest, to catch your breath. After you get better reduce time of step number 1 and increase step 2 and 3. If you do it right you should stand in a pool of sweat after 45 minutes. When you find yourself wiping the floor where you did the push ups just to get some grip again you know the following things: 

I wouldn't worry too much. Hang in there and always be careful with extremely heavy weights. The price we pay for bad form or for exaggerating always comes many years later (no complaints now does not imply what we are doing is good for our joints, ligaments and skeleton). 

Situation Due to a one sided sport I intensely practiced for a good portion of my teenage years(rowing in a team with only one oar per person), I have ever since experienced an awkward tight feeling in my hip when I stand up in the morning. After intense exercises I regularly feel a burn radiating down my leg on the outside of my thighs. I extreme cases and when it's very cold, I have a tingling sensation in my toes that makes me want to kick and stomp everything - the pain is really not a big deal, it is just so annoying! My very competent sports doctor diagnosed a piriformis syndrome. The radiating pain is caused by the muscle pressing on the Sciatic nerve. Unfortunately for me in addition to that, my entire gluteus is also extremely cramped up. My physiotherapist suggested puncturing the muscles with a needle that will causes the muscle to twitch and eventually relax. In my case the needles just bent.. this gives you and idea of how severely these muscles are cramped. The therapist said it is very unusual for these needles to bend, as they are quite thick. I searched all over the place for ways to help my muscles relax: massages, needle therapy, ultra wave therapy, stretches, no running, more running, more bicycle, Eventually I decided to take to extreme measures: at the local gym I used a machine to train external hip rotation with weights. I tried less weight and many reps until muscle failure/exhaustion, and I tried big weights with less reps, both slow and fast. I did this together with stretches and massages over 6 months now. It has become slightly better, but gluteus is still severely cramped, and in the meantime I have peaked on the weights (machine cannot do more than 110kg). I forgot to mention that I have no complaints whatsoever during activity, even under maximum loads. My questions: 

The thing with body fat percentage is it's proportional to the rest of your bodyweight, so if you're increasing your muscle mass 8lbs and gain 1lbs of fat, at 12%, your BF% would stay the same. Lifting heavy would be the way to go, that's what's necessary to stimulate muscle growth. Rather than eating more, I would suggest increasing the quality of the food you're eating, particularly proteins. Different protein foods have different biological values (BV), with the higher BV giving you better protein absorbtion. Also, especially given you've been holding steady for a while, unless you've been obsessively counting calories for the past 10 years, starting now isn't going to help. Just eat to whatever amount your hunger dictates. As far as running extra miles goes, I don't think that's really necessary, but if you're already running I'd suggest not increasing your time to match the distance. So if you're running an extra mile each outing, aim to keep it within the same length of time. This is the same principle as increasing the weight that you're lifting rather than increasing the reps. 

As has been mentioned, deadlifts and farmers walks will be key. What you'd also want to focus on is grip strength. Sliding straps under someone to get them onto the stretcher would benefit from grip work, so getting yourself a gripper could help, doing towel pull ups and chin ups and doing deadlifts with sand bags would help you deal with some of the unpredictability of ambulance work. As far as not having access to equipment - I can't think of a scenario in which getting adjustable dumbbells wouldn't be an option, so I'd suggest getting some (I would personally go for spinlock dumbbells if I didn't have access to a gym) and some plates. Depending on where you are, there might be an outdoor park with monkey bars allowing you to do bodyweight exercises. If you can do chin ups with your own bodyweight, you'll quite likely be able to lift your own weight where your arms are concerned. 

You do want to be doing the reps as quickly as possible, but if as quickly as possible is half a second for the positive and negative phases, you need to be lifting heavier weights. I wouldn't worry too much about the exact time, but if you're lifting heavy weights that will promote strength gain, you probably are looking at around 2 seconds up and down. Also, fast twitch is a bit of a misnomer. It's better to think of the fibers in terms of slow recovery and fast recovery, because there at least the way they're described accurately reflects how they behave. The 'fast twitch' muscle fibers are the ones most important for strength, but you're not necessarily 'twitching in a speedy fashion'. 

I'd look at running technique rather than a specific program for conditioning. Chi Running has worked nicely for me and has allowed me to complete a half marathon with no specific training, and no exceptional pain (like you, I did a lot of cycling though). If you're not trying to increase your timing, and just want to do it pain free, that's the path of least resistance. It sounds like it would be easier for you to stick to a technique program that allows you to run whenever you want for as long as you want than a specific schedule that a traditional running program would require you to adhere to.
