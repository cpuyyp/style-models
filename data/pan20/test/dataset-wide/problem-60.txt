My joke answer is yes, because there's not as much space to spread across, but the real answer is that it is highly unlikely that such a relatively advanced civilization could develop. 

Many more variables are needed (and must be specified or calculated) to give a good model, especially one that evolves with time. All of these must be measured, and with measurements come measurement errors. It's very difficult to accurately measure all of these and then compute where the star is in its lifecycle to any important degree of accuracy - in part because models are not too detailed. For an interesting list of models, see the Geneva grids of stellar evolution models. Not all of these apply to stars that will end their lives in supernovae, but quite a few do. 

Go all Roman on them and salt the earth (sort of). In the world I come from, there are no dragons, and so humans have instead turned their energies towards coming up with nasty ways to kill and torture each other. Some of these creative energies were channeled in what we now call the Third Punic War, where a place called Carthage was pretty much totally destroyed by the Romans. Stories tell that the ground was sowed with salt, essentially in an attempt to make it uninhabitable. Those stories are likely false, but then again, the Romans survived to tell them - not the Carthaginians. Even if salting the earth actually happened, it probably wouldn't work very well, and at any rate, you probably don't have the massive amounts of salt needed to cover large areas of the planet. However, you're a large, flying beast with fire and apparently a lot of time on your hands. Your problem seems to be that you're not being sufficiently devastating when you destroy entire human settlements. They can come back and start anew. Therefore, you can go about destroying the means of sustenance in an area, in some interesting ways. 

The idea of an ocean planet isn't too far-fetched. There are several moons in the Solar System - Enceladus and Europa, for instance - that have subsurface oceans. If the ice covering their surfaces melted, they'd be just what you're looking for. Extrapolating that to a larger, planetary-mass body isn't too hard. Creating an ocean planet isn't too difficult: 

It really comes down to two factors: waterways and open land. TL;DR: More waterways mean more cities and more people; more open land means more farmers and less people. The above summary pretty much says it all, but I obviously have to expand on just where the connection lies. I think I can cite some pretty good examples to support my point, but if I've made any logical or (even worse) factual errors, I'd be obliged if anyone could point them out. 

I was tempted, so I'm working (note the present tense) on a solution to this. I'll have to post it in parts, and I can't guarantee that I'll finish it, but I might as well share what I've got while I've got it. At the moment, I've decided to work on it in approximations; i.e. coming up with more and more detailed models from adding in more effects. Accounting for new effects should make for more accurate models. As a first approximation, we treat the rod as a one-dimensional stick (for lack of a better word) of length $l$. On each end is a heat source (the mantles of each of the two "Earths". For a simple model like this, we start with the heat equation in one dimension: $$\frac{\partial u}{\partial t}=\alpha \frac{\partial^2u}{\partial^2x}\tag{1}$$ where $u$ represents heat, $x$ is linear distance, $t$ is time and $\alpha$ is a constant. There are boundary conditions, namely $$u(0,t)=u(l,t)\neq0,\,\forall t> 0$$ The first condition is because both heat sources are identical. We then separate $x$ and $t$ to get $$u(x,t)=G(x)H(t)$$ Putting this back into $(1)$, $$\frac{\partial }{\partial t}\left[G(x)H(t)\right]=\alpha \frac{\partial^2}{\partial^2x}\left[G(x)H(t)\right]$$ Differentiating, $$G(x)H'(t)=\alpha G''(x)H(t)$$ Rearranging, $$\frac{H'(t)}{\alpha H''(t)}=\frac{G''(x)}{G(x)}=-\lambda$$ where $\lambda$ is some constant. This also means that $$H'(t)=-\lambda \alpha H''(t), G''(x)=-\lambda G(x)$$ We can easily solve for $H(t)$, because it is an equation of the form $$y=c\frac{dy}{dx}$$ where $c$ is a constant; this always will have some solution of the form $$y=ae^b+d$$ where $a$, $b$ and $d$ are constants. In the simplest case, $$H(t)=Ce^{-\alpha \lambda t}$$ where $C$ is a constant of integration. It is more difficult to solve for $G(x)$, but there is once again a solution, if you recall the formulae for the derivatives of trigonometric functions: $$\frac{d}{dx}\sin x = \cos x, \frac{d}{dx}\cos x = - \sin x$$ We can write it in the form of $$G(x)=A\sin(\sqrt{\lambda}x)+B\cos(\sqrt{\lambda}x)$$ We know that $u(0,t)=u(l,t)$, so $$A(0)+B(1)=A\sin(\sqrt{\lambda}l)+B\cos(\sqrt{\lambda}l)$$ This gives us $$\frac{A}{B}=\frac{\sin(\sqrt{\lambda}l)}{1-\cos(\sqrt{\lambda}l)}$$ and, substituting it back in, $$G(x)=B\left(\frac{\sin(\sqrt{\lambda}l)}{1-\cos(\sqrt{\lambda}l)}\sin(\sqrt{\lambda}x)+\cos(\sqrt{\lambda}x)\right)$$ Therefore, the solution is $$u(x,t)=B\left(\frac{\sin(\sqrt{\lambda}l)}{1-\cos(\sqrt{\lambda}l)}\sin(\sqrt{\lambda}x)+\cos(\sqrt{\lambda}x)\right)Ce^{-\alpha \lambda t}$$ We can do some more simplification. Let $x=0$ and $t=0$. We then have $$u(0,0)=B\left(\frac{\sin(\sqrt{\lambda}l)}{1-\cos(\sqrt{\lambda}l)}\sin(\sqrt{\lambda}\cdot 0)+\cos(\sqrt{\lambda}\cdot 0)\right)Ce^{-\alpha \lambda \cdot 0}=B(0+1)C(1)=BC$$ We also know that $u(0,t)=u(l,t)$, so $$u(0,0)=BC=u(l,0)=B\left(\frac{\sin(\sqrt{\lambda}l)}{1-\cos(\sqrt{\lambda}l)}\sin(\sqrt{\lambda}l)+\cos(\sqrt{\lambda}l)\right)Ce^{-\alpha \lambda \cdot 0}$$ Therefore, $$\left(\frac{\sin(\sqrt{\lambda}l)}{1-\cos(\sqrt{\lambda}l)}\sin(\sqrt{\lambda}l)+\cos(\sqrt{\lambda}l)\right)=1$$ Doing some simplification, $$\sin^2(\sqrt{\lambda}l)=\left(1-\cos(\sqrt{\lambda}l)\right)^2$$ $$1-\cos^2(\sqrt{\lambda}l)=1-2\cos(\sqrt{\lambda}l)+\cos^2(\sqrt{\lambda}l)$$ $$2\cos^2(\sqrt{\lambda}l)-2\cos(\sqrt{\lambda}l)=0$$ There are now two solutions: $$\cos(\sqrt{\lambda}l)=0\text{ or }\cos(\sqrt{\lambda}l)=1$$ The first one gives a solution of $$\lambda=\frac{\pi^2}{4l^2}$$ while the second gives a solution of $$\lambda=0$$ which is trivial and can safely be ignored. What about $B$ and $C$? Well, notice that in the final form, they are never really separated. We only care about their product, $BC$, which we have already determined is equivalent to $u(0,0)$! There's no problem there. The only issue that remains is to determine $\alpha$. This is easy; it is defined as the thermal diffusivity: $$\alpha=\frac{k}{\rho c_p}$$ where $k$ is the thermal conductivity, $\rho$ is the density and $c_p$ is the specific heat capacity. This gives us the full solution of the heat equation: $$u(x,t)=u(0,0)\left(\frac{\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right)}{1-\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right)}\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2l}x\right)+\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{2l}x\right)\right)e^{-\frac{k}{\rho c_p}\frac{\pi^2}{4l^2}t}$$ Simplifying, we reach the final form: $$u(x,t)=u(0,0)\left(\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2l}x\right)+\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{2l}x\right)\right)e^{-\frac{k}{\rho c_p}\frac{\pi^2}{4l^2}t}\tag{2}$$ On to radiated energy. If we approximate the rod as a black body - good enough for now - then Planck's law states that the intensity, $I$, is $$I(\nu,T)=\frac{2h\nu^3}{c^2}\frac{1}{e^{\frac{h\nu}{kT}}-1}\tag{3}$$ where $T$ is temperature, $\nu$ is wavelength and the rest are constants. We can use this for the derivation of the Stefan-Boltzmann law, describing the power emitted, $P$, per a unit area, $A$: $$\frac{P}{A}=\int_0^{\infty} I(\nu,T)d\nu \int d\Omega$$ where $\Omega$ represents a solid angle. Doing all the integration (No, I'm not going to write it all out), we find that $$P=A\epsilon \sigma T^4$$ where $\epsilon$ is the emissivity of the object and $\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Now, $$P=\frac{dE}{dt}$$ where $E$ is energy, so $$\int dE=A\epsilon \sigma T^4\int dt$$ and $$E=A\epsilon \sigma T^4 t \tag{4}$$ There are some caveats: 

1 Some results state that the habitable zone should be even smaller, although others disagree and say that it should be bigger. 

Break up the city-state into smaller regions. Make each region contain, say - oh, just divide it up into somewhere between 50 and 100 regions. But make sure that there aren't too many people in each region so that politics stay personal. Each person has to be familiar with the workings of the political system. But they can't deal with large-scale matters. So have each person vote one every matter that impacts his or her region. If you've got about 10,000 people, this doesn't seem too hard. Have voting on major issues take place over the span of, say, a week, with discussions in each village leading up to it. Make each region autonomous except in cases of war or drastic foreign policy disputes. Handle outside problems on a region-by-region basis. So if (in our world, where the US is this region) France has a problem with New York, let New York handle it. If war comes, then other regions will be obliged to join in. Make a loose coalition. Think 19th-century Germany/Prussia before there was any substantial unification. Sure, there were problems. But they were settled. 

From a logistics standpoint, the answer is yes. You need to re-supply any station that is not self-sufficient. However, this is simply a problem for all of the proposed ideas, not just this one. And it can be avoided by making the station completely self-sufficient. I'm being vague here on purpose, because there are a lot of factors that would go into solving this problem. 

Type of incoming radiation Dan Clarke mentioned something important, and I'm going to expand upon it. The spectrum of a black body isn't uniform; it's peaked at some characteristic wavelength $\lambda_{\text{max}}$. We can calculated this wavelength from Wien's law: $$\lambda_{\text{max}}=\frac{b}{T}$$ where $b$ is a constant, 2.897$\times$10$^{-3}$ m$\cdot$K. Using this, we find that the Sun has a peak wavelength of roughly 502 nm. This red giant, with a temperature half that of the Sun, has a peak wavelength of 1004 nm, in the near-infrared section of the electromagnetic spectrum. Moreover, there would be less emission of ultraviolet light than from a Sun-like star. Possible adaptations As I wrote about here, different photosynthetic pigments are more effective at different peak wavelengths. For peak emission around 1000 nm, certain bacteriochlorophylls will be efficient. If photosynthesis was possible, the dominant life forms would be purple and green bacteria. Now, it doesn't seem like photosynthesis could happen - the surface temperature is too high. Still, I'm wondering if there's a way around this - perhaps, somehow, the atmosphere is extremely dense and drastically reduces the amount of light reaching the surface to a reasonable amount. If so, purple and green bacteria could be the major denizens. You asked about mutations. Ultraviolet light is a cause of mutations, and given that the temperature of the star has changed, so has the amount of ultraviolet light - it's gone down. The same goes for any x-ray and gamma-ray radiation (which would be negligible to start with, for a Sun-like star). Therefore, we should see a slight decrease in mutation rates. But then again, there won't be much light out in the open anyway. At any rate, having an ozone layer would be less important. 

Because this isn't just an issue in one world - although I've described the specifications arising in the particular world I'm working on - I'm a bit wary of getting overly specific, but I hope the above constrains the question enough. 

Find a source of liquid, preferably something poisonous. Place most of the Towel in the liquid, allowing it to soak it up. Carefully - use gloves if necessary - tie the Towel up, like intertwining threads on a rope. The resultant rope-like weapon will hurt any opponent quite a lot, as it is now somewhat heavy. I believe this was referred to in the comic strip Calvin and Hobbes as a "rat tail". For close-quarters combat, feel free to use this wet Towel-rope to trip up the opponent or strangle them. You can also use the poison to your advantage. 

If this is done on a large enough scale by enough time travelers, it could wreak havoc on global economies throughout time. This could lead to shortages of goods in time periods when they could be needed desperately - or in the years after trading begins, when prices would have risen. Assuming that the trading does not happen at what the Doctor in Doctor Who calls "fixed points in time" - in other words, assuming that this trading can change the past, present and future - then I have a few questions: 

You could argue that regional occupation by Peacekeepers would be based on those principles. In a case of lawlessness or unclear governmental administration, UN occupation might be necessary for the promotion of state-building. The following Peacekeeper missions are examples of similar measures taken: 

Humans would have to adapt to this. Another issue is temperature. Hypothermia is possible in many situations. Blubber, like whales, seals, and some other creatures have, is a possible solution to this problem. 

Original image from here. Like sphennings, I'd recommend ignoring the curvature of the planet. For most small nations, the difference will be minimal. 

Why, hello there! I'm a Roksphere. I'm spherical, to protect myself against the harsh conditions of the desert, but I need to get around. I don't have any limbs. Instead, I propel gases out of one of my sides. Here's a diagram: 

Revised answer: You can't get an infinite quantity if you don't allow and other infinite quantities. so the scenario is impossible. 

Identify a berserker, hopefully at a young age. You'll need some kind of a test to do this - perhaps leave some weapons near a toddler and see what happens. If repeated tests clearly show that the child is a berserker, then he or she must be euthanized (to put it gently). Some sort of poison is the best way to go, preferably a painless one.

Synapses help carry signals between neurons. Chemical synapses use neurotransmitters to carry the transmission, whereas electrical synapses don't. This greatly increase transmission speeds in some animals. However, they aren't used in many parts of the human brain. Use them all over and you can likely greatly improve transmission speeds. You'll have to devote more brainpower to gathering resources, though; electrical synapses are more energy expensive. 

Look at Earth's biomes! When it comes to life and everything that comes along with it, we only have one data point, our own planet. Climate modeling is . . . hard. Really hard. When we're talking about where biomes will arise, sometimes it's easier to just look at the existing case study. Here, for your perusal, is a rough map of Earth's biomes: 

Congratulations! You just built an open cluster! Well, we built a simplified model of an open cluster, and we made more assumptions than I’d prefer: 

Mitigation Like I said before, you can't guard against this sort of a strategy too well. You have to hope you can keep your shields up long enough to fend off the attackers (or if the control ships are on the offensive, hit your targets). Now, I said I didn't have great ideas about how to fight this. But I have a couple: 

800 A.D. Charlemagne is crowned Holy Roman Emperor, the head of the new Carolingian Empire. This was mainly symbolic, but it is important that Charlemagne had been able to unite disparate small kingdoms which had been constantly divided up between members of the Carolingian dynasty, comping together and falling apart as people lived and died. 800 symbolizes start of a brief period of unity. 814 A.D. Louis the Pious, one of Charlemagne's sons, takes full control of the Empire. Charlemagne previously let all his children have positions of power, which could have led to another division of territory, but the deaths of Louis siblings later in life gave him full control. 817 A.D. Louis the Pious gave his three sons (Lothair, Louis the German, and Charles the Bald) partial control of three separate thirds of the Empire, inadvertently ensuring that when he died, there would be brutal fighting. In fact, the civil wars began much sooner, and lasted intermittently for several decades, even after his death in 840. Only the Treaty of Verdun, in 843, stopped the fighting - but divided the Empire. 

Doing a simple density calculation, I get $$\rho=\frac{0.09M_{\oplus}}{\frac{4}{3}\pi R^3}\approx15.896\text{ grams/cm}^3$$ For comparison, here's a list of the densities of the planets in the Solar System: $$\begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \hline \text{Planet} & \text{Average Density (g/cm)}^3\\ \hline \text{Mercury} & \text{5.4}\\ \hline \text{Venus} & \text{5.2}\\ \hline \text{Earth} & \text{5.5}\\ \hline \text{Mars} & \text{3.9}\\ \hline \text{Jupiter} & \text{1.3}\\ \hline \text{Saturn} & \text{0.7}\\ \hline \text{Uranus} & \text{1.3}\\ \hline \text{Neptune} & \text{1.6}\\ \hline \end{array}$$ This means that your planet would have a density much greater than any of the planets in the Solar System. It might be something like a very dense carbon planet (or perhaps even an iron planet). It's definitely possible for one to form.
