The answer is yes. Here is an example generalising the one of Serge and giving arbitrary codimension. Consider line bundle $L=O(1)\boxtimes O(1)$ on $\mathbb CP^1\times \mathbb CP^n$. A section of such a bundle has shape $$\sum_{i=0,j=0}^{i=1,j=n}a_{ij}x_iy_j=0,$$ i.e. $|L|=\mathbb C^{2n+2}$. A section is singular iff the matrix $a_{ij}$ has rank $1$. This happen in codimension $n$. If the rank of $a_{ij}$ is two the section is smooth and is a $\mathbb CP^{n-1}$ bundle over $\mathbb P^1$. 

There are at least 20 exercises on Hodge theory of Kahler manifolds in Huybrechts book "Complex geometry", section 3, maybe this is what you are looking for. In general this book has a lot of exercises and seem to be well written. 

Yes, such a map exists, and any such map has to be a map to a point in $\mathbb S^3$, because has to sends any holomorphic curve in the neighbourhood of $\mathbb C$ to a holomorphic curve in $S^3$, but $S^3$ does not contain any holomorphic curve (since the distribution of complex directions in $S^3$ is non-integrable). 

Since it is not clear if there is a reference for this statement, I'll give a proof here (we just worked it out with Sergey Galkin). This proof is complete for the case when the stabilizers of all points are abelian, otherwise it works modulo the following lemma (which should of course be true). 

The actions of $S_n$ and $\mathbb Z_n$ differ in the sense that in the first case the quotient is smooth (it is again $\mathbb C^n$) while in the second case it is singular. This is why in the fist case we have a nice presentation, but in the second not really. For example, the number of generators of the quotient can not be less than the dimension of Zariski tangent space to the singularity at zero of $\mathbb C^n/\mathbb Z_n$. Still in principle the presentation can be provided by toric geometry ($URL$ because the quotient is the toric singularity. For example, in your case of $\mathbb C^3/\mathbb Z_3$ let us change the coordinates so that $\mathbb Z_3$ is acting as $w_0\to w_0$, $w_1\to \mu w_1$, $w_2\to \mu^2 w_2$ (here $\mu^3=1$). Then you can write the minimal set of four generators: $w_0, w_1^3, w_2^3, w_1w_2$, and one obvious relation $(w_1^3w_2^3)=(w_1w_2)^3$ The case $\mathbb C^n/\mathbb Z_n$ for $n>3$ will be more involved, but the idea is the same roughly. First you chose the coordinates on $\mathbb C^n$ $w for which the action is diagonal. Then pick the minimal set of monomials (in these new coordinates) that are invariant under the action, and generate the whole set of invariant monomials (of positive degree). Consider one more case $n=4$, and chose the coordinates $w_i$, so that $Z_4$ is acting as $w_i\to \mu^iw_i$, $\mu^4=1$. The number of generators is $7$ this time: $w_0, w_1^4, w_3^4, w_2^2, w_1w_3, w_1^2w_2, w_3^2w_2$ 

To prove the case when $G$ is abelian we notice that in this case $\mathbb C^n/G$ is toric and it has a toric resolution, which is simply connected. Recall a statement from Griffiths and Harris (Chapter 4, page 494) 

As far as I understand, the answer to the question is no, you can check this in Handbook of Dynamical Systems, Volume 1, Part 1 By Boris Hasselblatt, Anatole Katok, page 173. This question is identical to the following -- suppose we have a diffeo of S^1 toplogically conjugate to an irrational rotation, can we make this conjugation a diffeo? Here is the sitation from the book: For smooth and analytic circle diffeomrophisms with extremely well approximable rotation number, the conjugacy to a roation and hence the invariant measure tend to be singular. Arnold's theorem exposed sigularity of the conjugacies as a generic phenomenon in typical one-parameters families of real-analityc maps 

The answer to question 2 is negative thanks to Kamawata-Morrison conjecture about nef cones of Calabi-Yau varieties that is proven for surfaces (a recent reference is here $URL$ and to the comment of Damiano below. Indeed, it is known that on a minimal two-dimesnional surface of Kodaira dimesnion 0 the fundamental domain of the action of automorphism of the surface on the nef cone is rational polyhedral (see the above reference). So it is sufficient to consider only ample classes that belong to one rational polyhedral fundamental domain. Notice that every nef integral class (apart from $K$) on each Enriques surface is effective (see the proof of Damiano). Now notice that since the fundamental domain is rational polyhedral, the semi-group of integer vectors in it is finitely generated, so only finitely many integer vectors can not be presented as a sum of two others. In other words, only finite number of ample divisors in a given fundamental domain are not linearly equivalent to a sum of several divisors. Since by definition all domains are the same, the statement is proven. 

If you consider the case of smooth surfaces then $Big(X)=Amp(X)$ if and only if $X$ has no curves with negative self-intersection. The point is that for surfaces the closers of these two cones are dual. 

The $\mathbb R^2\setminus \mathbb Q^2$ provides an example that is locally connected but not locally compact. Proof. We need to show that the group of automorphisms of $\mathbb R^2\setminus \mathbb Q^2$ is acting transitively on $\mathbb R^2\setminus \mathbb Q^2$. The idea is to conisder piecwise linear automorphisms of $\mathbb R^2\setminus \mathbb Q^2$ with rational coefficients with infinately many breaks. In order to explain how this works we will conisder the $\mathbb R\setminus \mathbb Q$ and prove the statement here. Let $x$ and y be two points in $\mathbb R\setminus \mathbb Q$. Then conisder two monotonly decresing (for $i\ne 0$) seuqences of rational numbers $x_i$, $y_i$, $i\in \mathbb Z$ with $x_0=x$, $y_0=y$, with $lim_{i\to + \infty} x_i=x$, $lim_{i\to + \infty} y_i=y$ and $lim_{i\to - \infty} x_i=x$, $lim_{i\to - \infty} y_i=y$. Finally take the piecwise linear map from $\mathbb R\setminus \mathbb Q$ to itself that sends $x_i$ to $y_i$. This is the automorphism we a looking for. In the case of $\mathbb R^2\setminus \mathbb Q^2$ the same thing can be done by chosing anappropriate triangulations of $\mathbb R^2$. I don't see how to make a locally compact set. 

A theorem of Sacks and Uhlenbeck tells us $URL$ that we are still in the good shape for free homotopy $2$-classes. Namely, any such class can be represented by a collection of minimal spheres joined by geodesic segments. I would guess that in the case when you consider $\pi_n(M^{n+1})$ sometimes there will be a minimal hypersurface that realises such a class, for example in the case $M^{n+1}=S^1\times S^n$. But for a general situation I remember a "claim" of Gromov, that such an preferred class does not exist, in particular for the case of homotopy groups of spheres. Unfortunately, I don't remember a reference (in fact I might be wrong here, see the article of Gromov below). Though the complexity of the question can be traced in the article of Larry Guth, treating in particular the case of maps $S^3\to S^2$. Isoperimetric inequalities and rational homotopy invariants $URL$ ADDED. In his new article Gromov says a bit about "good representatives" of maps in fixed homothopy classes $S^N\to S^n$. But this ounds more like a collection of questions and possible directions rather than some definite theorems (I guess it reflect the current state of these questions). This is contained in section 2, $URL$ 

Generalising the case of Hirzebrouch surface, you can say that toric varieties admit explicit description of Kahler cone. Also for each Fano variety its Kahler cone is polyhedral, i.e., it is spanned by a finite number of rays (but this does not mean, that the description is easy). If you leave the class of Fano varieties unpleasant things may start to happen. For example for a generic blow up of $\mathbb CP^2$ in $n\ge 10$ points the structure of Kahler cone it is still unknown (for $n<9$ we get Fano), this is related to Nagata conjecutre $URL$ Morrison's conjecture states that for a Calabi-Yau manifold the quotient of the Kahler cone by the group of isometries of the manifold is polyhedral. The conjecture was proved only for surfaces, there is a recent very nice paper of Burt Totaro on this topic "The cone conjecture for Calabi-Yau pairs in dimension two", $URL$ 

First let me give some cheap examples of CY manifolds that satisfy condition of 1) while they are not tori quotients. Example. Let $X$ be any CY manifold with $h^{1,1}(X)=1$, for example $X$ can be a quintic in $\mathbb CP^4$. Then the conclusion of 1) holds, because all Kahler Ricci flat metric on $X$ are proportional. Now, to get an example with $h^{1,1}(X)=2$ one can just take a direct product $X_1\times X_2$ of CY manifolds satisfying $h^{1,1}(X_i)=1$. So the list of manifolds with $c_1=0$ satisfying 2) is larger than tori quotients. But maybe all these examples can be understood. For example, it should be easy to show that a $K3$ surface does not satisfy 1). I'll give a brief proof in the case of a generic K3 that does not have $-2$ curves. EDDITED. I put more details here so that it becomes clear that was said previously is correct. The good thing about harmonic forms is that the sum of two harmonic forms is harmonic. By Nakai-Moishenzon (for Kahler surfaces), the Kahler cone of a K3 without $-2$ curves coincides with a connected component of $(1,1)$ classes with positive square in $H^{1,1}$. Now, by Yau in any such class there is a unique Ricci-flat metric. And also obviously there exists a unique harmonic metric. Suppose that assumption 1) holds for our K3. Then it is obvious that this means that each harmonic form $w$ with $\int_{K3}w^2>0$ in the correct component of the cone is Ricci flat. Let me get a contradiction from this So let $w_1$ and $w_2$ be two Kahler Ricci-flat forms harmonic with respect to the metric defined by $w$ on a $K3$ surface, and moreover that $aw_1+bw_2$ is Ricci flat again. Then we know that $(aw_1+aw_2)^2$ is proportional to $\Omega\wedge \bar\Omega$, where $\Omega$ is the complex volume form on $K3$. Consider now the family of forms $w_1-tw_2$, $t>0$. Take the first moment $t_0$ when we have $\int_{K3}(w_1-t_0w_2)^2=0$. But since $(w_1-tw_2)^2=c_t\Omega \wedge \bar\Omega$ for some $c_t>0$ for all $t$ less than $t_0$ (since this form is Ricci flat) we conclude that $(w_1-t_0w_2)^2$ is equal to zero point-wise. So the kernel of $w_1-tw_2$ should define a holomorphic folitation on $K3$. Since for $K3$ it holds $h^{1,1}=20$, we should get a tremendous amount of holomorphic foliations on it, but this is clearly impossible. This is still not a 100% complete reasoning, but I am sure it can be completed. So it seems to me that the complete list of manifolds satisfying 1) are all manifolds that are finite quorients of a torus times a collection of CY manfiolds with $h^{1,1}=1$. The idea is simple: whenever you have two Ricci-flat forms such that $w_1+tw_2$ is Ricci flat for small $t$, this should lead to a local metric splitting of the manifold into direct product. Then we should just use De-Rahm decomposition theorem. 

First of all, the notion Symplectic Calabi-Yau is quite new. A few persons who use it (including myself) usually mean by this symplectic manifolds with $c_1=0$, (this is just to make sure that we speak about the same thing) In real dimension $4$ we know for the moment only two types of symplectic Calabi-Yau manifolds - $K3$ surfaces and $T^2$ bundles over $T^2$. These manifolds have as well the structure of a complex manifold with a non-vanishing holomorphic volume form. It is conjectured that there are no other symplectic Calabi Yau manifolds in dimension $4$. In real dimension six there are quite a lot of symplectic CY manifolds coming from the twistor construction (you can check here: $URL$ and some of them do have a complex structure, but this is not known for all of them. At the same time, probably you know that in dimension $2n\ge 6$ the following question is open: Question. Is it true that every manifold $M^{2n}$ that has an almost complex structure $J$ has as well a holomorphic structure homothopic to J? This is an old question and apparently no one has an idea of how to answer it. Now, the answer to your question in dimension $6$ depends on what you mean by a complex Calabi-Yau. This notation is not used in math literature. If by such a manifold you mean a complex manfiold with $c_1=0$, then you would not be able (for the moment) to get any example in dimension $6$ where the answer to your question is no (because the above Question is open). On the other hand, if by complex Calabi-Yau you mean a complex manifold with a non-vanishing holomorphic volume form, then the answer to your question is yes, an example is given in $URL$ There is a symplectic Calabi Yau 6-manifold in this paper, that has $b_3=0$, hence it can not have a holomorphic volume form of top degree for any complex structure. One can construct further such examples. 

The question of existence of flat connection on tangent bundles of manifolds was studied quite extensively. Milnor proved in one of his early papers that surfaces (compact without boundary) of non-zero Euler characteristic don't admit such a connection. A result of Smillie can be used to rule out existence of flat connection on tangent bundles of many even dimensional manifolds; a manifold $M^n$ that admit such a connection should satisfy the condition $|\chi(M^n)|\le \frac{||M^n||}{2^n}$, where $||M^n||$ denotes the simplicial norm of $M^n$. You can check $URL$ , page 229 for a short proof. Also, Smillie constructed examples of manifolds of non-zero Euler characteristics that admit flat connection on their tangent bundle: $URL$ The following recent article of Goldman will be relevant Milnor's seminal work on flat manifolds and bundles $URL$ 

It sounds like the only non-trivial solution is $ae^{i(z+\bar z)/2r}=ae^{-y/r}$. Taking difference of two equations we see that all solution depend only on $y$ and if you restrict to $y$ axis the equation is easy to solve. 

He is a construction of such a product, I would like to thank Fedor Bogomolov, for providing the answer. Construction. It is well known that the symmetric square $S^2(C)$ of a curve $C$ of genus $2$ is an Abelian surface blown up at one point (the canonical divisor of $C$). Consider the degree $16$ cover of $S^2(C)$ corresponding to the sub-lattice $2\mathbb Z^4$ in $H_1(C,\mathbb Z)$. The quotient of this surface by an involution is a Kummer surface, and hence it has infinite number of $-2$ rational curves. Let $C'$ be the degree $16$ cover of $C$ (again corresponding to the subgroup $2\mathbb Z^4$ in $H_1(C,\mathbb Z)$). Then one can check that there is a map $C'\times C'$ to the Kummer surface. $C'\times C'$ is the surface we are looking for. 

Consider for simplicity smooth projective varieties defined over $\mathbb C$. In this case, the minimal size equals $n+1$ where $n$ is the dimension of the variety. Proof. Let $M^n$ be such a variety. Take $n+1$ generic very ample divisors $D_0,...,D_n$. Then such divisors don't have a common intersection. At the same time for any $i$ $M^n\setminus D_i$ is affine. In order to show that you do need $n+1$ open affine sub-varieties, notice that the complement to an open affine sub-variety is a closed variety of dimension $n-1$. Now proceed by induction. For projective irreducible varieties exactly the same reasoning should hold, and it can be generalised further I guess 

You might be interested in the following paper, $URL$ Abstract: We show that the number of birational automorphism of a variety of general type $X$ is bounded by $c · vol(X, K_X)$, where $c$ is a constant which only depends on the dimension of $X$. 

Here is an arcticle of Luo, A Presentation of the Mapping Class Groups $URL$ I remember seen somewhere a neat presentation of the hyperelliptic mapping class group, but I can't remeber now the reference, but you can check page 12 in the article Hyperelliptic Szpiro inequality $URL$ 

Let me give a series of examples with curves that are nef but not free according to your definitions (I never saw these definitions apart from the case of surfaces but this is possibly just my ignorance). Consider any hypersurface $X_d$ in $\mathbb CP^n$ of degree $n\le d\le 2n-3$, $n\ge 4$. Such a hypersuface contains a line $L$. Now, by adjunction the anti-canonical bundle of $X_d$ is $O(n+1-d)$. Since $L$ is a line $c_1(T_{X_d}|L)=n+1-d$, at the same time $T_{X_d}|L$ contains a sub-bundle $O(2)$, so, since $n+1-d-2<0$, the bundle $T_{X_d}|L$ is not positive. Finally, since $Pic(X_d)=\mathbb Z$, the line $L$ intersects all divisors positively. 

For your new question: functions that satisfy your inequality don't exist Proof. Suppose $f(x)+f(x+u+v)> f(x+u)+f(x+v)$ for all $x$ and all linearly independent $u$ and $v$. Let us get a contradiction from it. Take any square insribed in a circle, and rotate it leaving insrcibed. Rotating continuously for the angle 90 degrees you can exchange to pairs of opposite vertices. Here is the previous counterexample: $(x^2+y^2)^{\frac{1}{4}}$ 

Added. I just realised that the statement concerning Moishenzon manifolds holds in dimension up to $4$. In dimension three this is a corollary of minimal model programme and in dimension $4$ this follows from Theorem 0.4 here: $URL$ In dimensions higher than four the statement would follow from the main conjecture of minimal model programm it states that a projective manifold with pseudoeffective canonical class has non-negative Kodaira dimension. This conjecture holds if dimension less than $4$ and for dimension four the above article can be used instead of it for our purpose. Indeed, every Moishenson manifold admits a blow up that is projective. According to the condition that you state the canonical class of the blow up is pseudoeffective. So according to the conjecture a power of the canonical bundle on the blow up has a non-zero section. Such a section should vanish on the exceptional divisors of the blow up. So, I guess you should be able to push it down to the original manifold (again to a section of the power of the canonical bundle). This section would not vanish since it could vanish only on a hypersurface and this would mean the $c_1\ne 0$ (since there are plenty of curves on Moishenson manifolds). More details. The canonical class of the blow up is pseudoeffective beacuse it is positive on every coverening family of curves. In particular the blow up is not unirulled. So it should have non-negative Kodaira dimension according to conjecture 1.6 here (page 6): $URL$
