Bar weight, as SS prescribes. This is 18% for the nerdy among ye. Note that I only did one set, though sometimes I do two, or one set of 8-10. 36% 54% 90% (though 74%--185 pounds--would've been normal for me) "100%", but though I was doing singles it definitely isn't my 1RM. I have no clue what my 1RM squat is, though I assume it's between 260 and, say, 290. 

Bodybuilding is not strength training. Bodybuilding is a very specific practice to improve one's looks. Strength training, by contrast, is training to improve the capabilities of one's body. Strength training is the broader category, but the two should not be interchanged freely in a discussion about health benefits. 

I don't see the point in switching up your program instead of fixing your nutrition and sleep. Moreover, I don't see the point in doing this specific hybrid. If you want rows, try Phrak's GSLP: 

If you could do 5 chin-ups 4 months ago, then didn't work out for three months, then you started doing curls, I think you just got weaker from not working out. Curls won't necessarily improve your pull-up performance dramatically. 10kg dumbbells are way, way lighter than you are, for example. If you want to be able to do pull-ups, do pull-ups. The definition in your arms has very little to do with your ability to do them. 

The "bandages" that "real boxers" wear (whether on TV or not) are called handwraps, and are worn underneath the glove to add stability to the bones of the hand and wrist, as well as to prevent chafing with the inside of the glove. (They are not for soaking up blood inside the gloves, though I guess they do that job too.) I would add three things to your punching bag workouts: 

One can simultaneously be cognizant of proper technique when bidding and landing and be willing to compromise proper technique in order to get the disc. In contrast, Ultimate injury-prevention website injurytimeout.com recommends chest/abdomen landing, though technically one could interpret that to include both side and front landings. (Personally I think they mean chest not side.) 

Dude, don't stress it. Eat a high-protein diet without sweets or junk. Pick a lifting program with room for cardio. 5/3/1 is a common and solid choice for this. I see two templates working well. The first is cardio during the lifting workout: 

You may have stumbled with your sleep, eating, stress levels, amount of sunlight or socialization, or fallen into overtraining in a million other ways. Maybe your program simply has too much volume for you. Regardless, it sounds like you're overtrained. Take a day or a week off, and when you start up again, consider doing dramatically less. Five days a week of lifting is often taxing. Sometimes more rest coupled with more intense lifting on the days when you do work out is easier on your recovery in the long term. 

Ding ding ding! We've found the culprit. Your body relies on carbohydrate for most of its energy. If you go low-carb, you're relying on transitioning from using carbs to ketosis, where you're using fats. Many people report being low-energy when in ketosis, and even those who have plenty of energy while in a ketogenic state usually report being low-energy during the transition into and out of ketosis. So, being low carb is probably the problem. But just as important, being low-carb and then sometimes giving yourself carbs means that you're taking yourself out of ketosis, then relying on your body to notice that the carbs are gone before transitioning back to ketosis. During those transitions you're almost certainly deprived of energy. I'd advise either going full low-carb with absolutely no sweets, or giving up low-carb and eating moderate amounts of carbs (sweet potato, potato, rice, fruit), with particular attention towards eating enough carbohydrate before working out. 

Drop weight and add reps. Remember, too, that weighted pull-ups are only one part of working to a one-arm chin. You should still be doing one-arm negatives, one-and-a-half arm chins, and so on. 

That's really it. Try abstaining from grains (like beer), legumes and dairy for thirty days. Then re-introduce these items one by one, and gauge your response. People are different. Some people can handle these items better than others. 

Your Situation It might not make sense to start lifting for the first time a month before a race. Your legs may be very sore for several days when you first start, since your body is not used to that kind of work. Therefore, it would probably be wise to begin lifting weights after your first 10k is over, not before. Also, having more muscle may or may not help with the ache you feel in your muscles when running. It will probably make you faster and less injury-prone, however. Once you are able to start, lifting will definitely get you stronger (and therefore healthier) and faster. One of the best resources for getting started is Mark Rippetoe's Starting Strength (book and wiki). You could either take a few months off from running and do a novice progression, or you could simply add a squat/deadlift workout a few times a week to your current regimen. A typical novice progression (cribbed from Starting Strength) is essentially: 

You're sore Wednesday because you squatted Monday. Soreness from lifting can easily last two or three days, and even get worse on later days. It's called Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness or DOMS. 

I could be wildly wrong, but I don't think there's much to do. I would be wary of taping them unless (and even if) an instructor had a specific method. Your best course of action is boring: 

So-called "ideal" body weight calculations are not in any way supposed to be used as a guideline for how much weight to lose. Do not allow them any power over your life. Superior Alternatives Using BMI or IBW to measure how much you should weigh is pointing your efforts at the wrong goal. If you want to be lean, work on your body fat percentage. If you want to be healthy, work on strength, conditioning, and mobility goals. (If you're tremendously overweight, picking a goal weight for your initial weight loss can work, but there's absolutely no reason to bring BMI into it, and once that goal weight is reached, it's better to target more useful numbers.) Instead of targeting a specific BMI goal, measure what you want to improve. Want to look better? Get a camera and a tape measure and track how you look (with consistent clothing, pose and lighting) and measurements of your arms, legs, hips, and waist. Or set a performance goal, like "finish a 5k" or "squat twenty times with a barbell as heavy as I am". Want to be healthy? Develop a strength and conditioning program to work towards your desired health markers, like body fat percentage. The closest useful analogue to BMI is the Body Shape Index, which seems to be a better predictor of one's risk of death. Keep in mind that while it takes belly fat into account, it still does not keep track of muscle or actual markers of physical health, like mobility, strength, inflammation, diabetic state, or cardiovascular disease.
