Of course, the boundaries are a bit blurry. They are very similar, and there are cases where either would apply. But in general, a graphic novel is longer and more unified. 

What is going on in this scene? Why is it important that the girl is taking the initiative? Why does everyone go watch? What is Alberto talking about - what's happening here? 

In Jude the Obscure, work that Jude does is masonry - stones and menial labor. His ambition is to become a scholar - books and mental labor. I'm struggling to see how these relate to each other - how is Jude doing masonry related to his ambitions? Is this to provide a contrast, or is there something else? 

I recently procured a copy of Jude the Obscure by Thomas Hardy. Upon opening it, something struck me as odd: It says 'part first' instead of 'first part' or 'part one'. I've never seen this before, and it seems... ungrammatical to me. 

If "To Autumn" were merely a pretty description of the season, it wouldn't be considered a great poem. In fact, to read it as a straightforward celebration is to fall into the same trap as the bees in the first stanza: 

Similarly, the second half of Sodom and Gomorrah (volume 4), and the entirety of The Prisoner and The Fugitive (volumes 5 and 6), constitute what is called "the Albertine cycle". Aaron Matz says of this cycle: 

The lines you've quoted are from the 1842 version of the poem, which uses stay intransitively and obscures the sense a bit. The corresponding lines in the 1833 version use the verb transitively, and make the sense clearer: 

So the sort of ritual we expect around romantic love—a man chasing a reluctant love object, wooing that object with poetry and gifts, eventually overcoming that reluctance—was associated in ancient Greece with homosexuality, not with one's eventual marital partner. Coontz says that the Greeks even considered this sort of homosexual love the noblest of all: 

In the September/October 2017 issue of the Cicada magazine, they ran a story by Nino Cipri, entitled "A Silly Love Story". (Published online by the author (who also goes by Nicole).) The story focuses on Jeremy - our main character, a man - and Merion, a bi-gendered character, who are in a relationship. We see the story of how Jeremy and Merion met, and we see that Merion has an encounter with a girl who is curious as to whether Merion is a boy or girl. 

Why does O-san have a 'vacant look on her face, as though she had been roughly wakened from some peculiarly delicious dream'? What does this imply? 

In Sophie's World, we have one scene that can be described as a sex scene. It's in the chapter 'The Garden Party'; page 478 in my edition. Here's the relevant part: 

In the January 2004 issue of The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction, they ran a story called "Nimitseahpah". In this story, there is a 'darkness' at the bottom of a mine: 

Marital love in Greek society was not thought of as an enduring romantic and emotional bond between two equals, with sexual fidelity a marker of their trust in and satisfaction with each other. The Ancient History Encyclopedia says: 

If marriage for the ancient Greeks was not an erotic [from eros] bond, then this raises two questions: (1) What was marriage for them? and (2) What was an erotic bond for them? Let's look at each in turn. Marriage among the ancient Greeks With regard to the first question, Nicholas Rauh explains that among landholding Greeks, women were married off to neighboring men to consolidate land ownership, to bear children, and to look after the household: 

Yes, the books are related and are intended to be read in order. In Search of Lost Time is one work in seven volumes. Each volume is not an independent work. Rather, the novel is a developing story; the narrator is relating events from his life, and each volume furthers the narrative. Outside of specialized research or publication/translation contexts, it is rare to find the individual volumes being treated singly. The English Wikipedia, for example, does not even have separate entries for each volume. (The French one, however, does.) It is true that some sections of the narrative are relatively self-contained. For example, Roger Shattuck points out: 

Here's a list of the books that I have, in no particular order, so that you people know what I looked through. 

But what are some examples of Matt being less sure of himself? In what other ways are they different? 

Tolkien and Lewis started it when Tolkien returned to Oxford. I'll answer the questions that you mentioned one by one. Unless otherwise specified, the quotes come from Inside The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe by James Stuart Bell, Carrie Pyykkonen, and Linda Washington, chapter 5. When was it set up? 

Why does Merion react so strongly? I understand that they are not one specific gender at all times, like the brunette seems to be insinuating, but why not just say 'I'm bi-gendered'? Why immediately blow up at the girl? 

On some books, I've noticed that they have colors on the edges of the pages. For instance, on my Tikkun: 

(Port Said is the head of the Suez Canal; the Sandwich Islands are Hawaii. ) This theoretical journey is pretty much the exact itinerary proposed by Fogg, so Verne must have seen this article and found it an inspiration for his novel. Another inspiration was the American entrepreneur George Francis Train. In 1870, he traveled around the world in 80 days. Well, the actual travel took 80 days, but he broke his journey and hung around in France for a while. From the Wikipedia article linked above: 

As long as Endymion pines after the ideal beauty of the moon, it is out of his grasp. But when he falls in love with a mortal woman, she turns out to be Cynthia after all. By enjoying her earthly beauty, Endymion ultimately finds union with his divine beloved after all. The connection with the earlier poem is readily seen, in that the celebration of beauty is granted mythic force as a path to union with the divine. "Hyperion" is rather darker. Focusing as it does on the Titans after their defeat by the Olympians, it immediately undercuts any sense that to be divine (or to be united with the divine) guarantees that no harm can befall one. Paradoxically, Apollo the Olympian (and the divine poet) becomes a god precisely because he undergoes great suffering and thereby has an insight into human tragedy—something the Titans lack. Keats abandoned this poem, however, around April 1819; perhaps the fact that the Titans are suffering as well made the contrast between Olympians and Titans hard to sustain. He took up the theme again later that year, in "The Fall of Hyperion". Here too Keats focuses on suffering and the role of the poet. On the one hand, poetry can present false, unreachable ideals to humankind and thus increase its suffering; on the other, poetry can provide a visionary insight into the nature of human suffering and thereby foster compassionate acceptance. Keats ended up abandoning this poem too. It seems that as his views on what poetry should be grew more complex, they resisted explicit expression in any final, resolved form. The shorter "Ode on a Grecian Urn" captures the tensions all the better for leaving them unresolved: the urn, as a beautiful object, is outside human suffering; yet the figures on the urn are also devoid of fulfillment. It's true, then, that "Endymion" and "Hyperion" share the same mythic universe; Endymion's beloved, Semele (whom Keats calls Cynthia), was in fact Hyperion's daughter. It's also true that thematically, they share concerns: like so much of Keats's work, they are about the nature of poetry and the role of the poet. Yet they are vastly different. The conception of poetry in the later work is darker and less straightforwardly idealistic. There is no evidence that "Hyperion" was intended as a continuation of the earlier work. If anything, the fact that it is in blank verse, as opposed to the heroic couplets of "Endymion", suggests that Keats did not mean to connect the two. Finally, critics have noted that "Endymion" was influenced by Shelley's 1815 poem "Alastor", and probably intended as a response. "Alastor" tells the story of a poet who, like Endymion, pines after an unattainable lady. Unlike Endymion's, though, Alastor's quest is unsuccessful, largely because he lacks human sympathy. There is an argument to be made that insofar as "The Fall of Hyperion" also take up the theme of poets and human sympathy, it represents a later and more considered meditation on the problems raised Shelley's work. Certainly the two poems have been compared, rather to Shelley's detriment. As far as I know, however, nobody has raised the possibility that Keats was thinking of "Alastor" not just while writing "Endymion", but also some three years later while working on the "Hyperion" poems. If that speculation has merit, then there is another connection between "Endymion" and "Hyperion". Still, they would be connected via Shelley rather than directly with each other. 

In The Magic Grandfather, by Jay Williams (published 1979), there are several spells that do certain things. For instance, Aldoragamba luro vopo vir voarchadumia is a transportation spell. Tripsarecopsem helps with the crystal ball. 

What they are saying here, is that this character is making the other people do his work for him - and that these people are doing the same thing, pushing their work onto other people. (FWIW, they are commonly referred to as help vampires across the Stack Exchange network.) Since Tom Sawyer tricked the other people into doing the work that he was supposed to do, they are comparing these people to him. 

Was Hardy here exposing his own anti-Semitic prejudices here, or was he merely commenting on the general sentiment in England at the time relating to Judaism? 

The eyes being reflective are proof that a Soul is inside of the body in The Host, and is used as verification by both Souls and humans:
