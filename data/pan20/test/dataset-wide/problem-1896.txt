If you will be asking the company for special accommodations for your condition, then you must discuss them before accepting an offer. I would wait until you sense that they are very interested, and about to make you an offer. During your interviews, try to sense the culture of the company, and in your own mind if this is the kind of environment in which your background would or wouldn't be an issue. Remember, you want to find a great fit for yourself - one in which you can excel. You want an employer who can work with you to deal with your condition and still be successful in your career, not one who will quickly be looking to marginalize you, or looking for an excuse to terminate you. You can only get there by discussing your situation before being hired. If you aren't asking for any accommodations, you might need to consider if you will need to incur periodic absences (for ongoing treatment, for those 2 days per month, etc). As a hiring manager, that is something I'd want to know ahead of time. In many companies, it wouldn't harm your chances for the job, but in some it would. That's something you would want to know before agreeing to an offer. And if your condition will neither require special accommodations, not incur periodic absences, not display obvious symptoms, then you may not need to disclose your condition at all. You may have things well under control, and thus there is no need to worry a prospective employer unnecessarily. There are brain injury support organizations who can help you. You should connect with them and discuss the job search you are embarking on. They have much more experience with this than anyone here would. 

You should be extremely honest in your appraisal. But you should provide only facts and your own observations. You should never include rumors or the observations of others - let them provide their own feedback. 

It would seem reasonable to indicate that you believe you are being underpaid and why. But it might be better to focus on your increased value to the company, rather than your salary relative to others. If the company decreased their starting offers, would you feel overpaid and ask for a reduction? 

Yes, that is perfectly okay. If you have no desire to extend your contract, there's no need to discuss it (unless the employer brings it up first). 

Waiting until you start work, then springing such a surprise on your employer is probably not a good idea. While they may not be able to fire you or pressure you, I'm sure you understand that it can be an unpleasant situation all around. Within the bounds of the law and your contract, you might be denied raises, made to work shifts that you would not prefer, and given less than desirable projects. Workers who don't go along with the company culture can tend to become very unhappy. 

If you truly don't understand the concept of sales puffery, then you are in the wrong profession. You should find a new job immediately and resign from this one. Perhaps something with no sales/marketing or presentation involvement would suit you better. 

In my experience, it's always better to be honest, rather than having to constantly dance around an uncomfortable issue or to lie about it. Clearly your interviewer wasn't happy with your explanation, and you are worried that others will be equally unhappy. It sounds like you should follow your instincts and be more direct about it. 

Write to the recruiter, thanking them for the opportunity to attend the recruiting event. You then apologize for not getting back to them sooner, and ask if it would okay to get in touch with them in 2 years when you start looking for a job after school completes. You also ask if they would please keep you in mind for future recruiting events. 

When you aren't pleased with your working situation, you are usually best off to discuss this with your immediate managers. These are the people who have the best chance to help you. Going over their head immediately might cause resentment. And his boss's boss would likely just go back to your immediate managers to have them handle it anyway. If I were the immediate manager put in that situation, I'd be unlikely to want to help you out. You might also wish to tone down your words a bit before talking with them. As a manager, I know I react poorly when folks use terms like "nightmare" when discussing my workplace. Remote work isn't for everyone. Many folks prefer to work as closely as possible with others on their team. This seems to be particularly true of knowledge workers. If you are a good employee, and are currently doing your job to the best of your ability, the company may be willing to work with you to find a non-remote position for you. 

I'm not sure what "sort of" means in this context, but if you sort of already agreed to an amount, then you can still negotiate, but the likelihood of getting what you want is probably sort of lessened. Before you meet to discuss a full-time offer, consider your alternatives, and be ready to move ahead depending on how they respond: 

You should fill in the "Name" field with your current legal name. You should fill in the "Preferred Name" field with the name you want people to use (I assume that is your "new name"?) You should fill in the "Surname" field with your current legal family name (in the US, it's the "last name"). You don't need to adjust your CV accordingly, although it might cause a bit of confusion if these differ. 

Sure. It probably couldn't hurt. But it would be surprising if they don't know your salary and the salary levels for the position. So you won't be telling them something they don't already know. You would be better served negotiating for a raise based on your value to the company. Before you meet, remind yourself of all the good things you have done for the company the past 3 years, and think about why you will be worth more to the company than "the minimum" after you are promoted. Express those thoughts in your meeting and ask for more. If it were me, I'd lead with the "value to company" idea when negotiating a new salary. But if that failed, then ask why you are below the "minimum" for the new position (if it actually turns out that way). If I had to guess, you won't be below the minimum if you do get the promotion. 

In my part of the US, in the software field in which I work, it is considered appropriate to always offer a handshake. It doesn't matter who extends their hand first. If someone offers his or her hand, shake it firmly, but not with a painfully hard grip, while smiling and looking the person in the eye. If the individual doesn't offer their hand, then you offer yours. Usually you would also say something like "Hello, nice to meet you." In other cultures, the norms are different. It's very important to consider the norms in your specific culture and locale. 

You gave them your minimum. They already know you would not accept less, so it wouldn't make sense for them to offer less. 

Offer money. You have little to no leverage here. But you can offer money if they meet short term milestones and threaten to remove them as a supplier if they don't. Sometimes dangling a bonus can get a non-responsive supplier's attention. Sometimes not. And use this as a learning opportunity. Betting your company/project/product on a single supplier is bad business. Fix that ASAP. 

The only person who can realistically answer this question is your boss. The fact that you didn't know the answer indicates a failing in the communications between you and your boss. And the blame for that is split between the two of you. Next time, talk with your boss on a regular basis. Learn her/his expectations. Ask regularly "How am I doing?" If you don't already know, ask "What do I need to do to get a top level performance review?" And based on the comments, it seems your job expectations differ from your former company's expectations. These are things you want to try hard to discern before accepting your next position. Ask lots of questions while interviewing. If you are looking to avoid a job that expects overtime, ask about that up front. That will give you the best chance to avoid getting into the same expectation mismatch next time. 

It varies from company to company, and role to role. In some shops the IT Manager does almost everything him/herself and delegates little (if any). Sometimes the "IT Manager" doesn't even manage anyone. In other shops the IT Manager manages a large enough and well-trained enough team that the manager does very little hands-on work. You almost always need to know enough about the technologies to understand the work requests, and to find a way to get the work done. For a manager, that usually means knowing enough to effectively communicate, prioritize, understand potential issues, hire, sometimes bring in contractors, etc. But for a manager, the real in-depth knowledge often comes from folks working on your team. You usually don't need to be the super-technical-know-it-all. You do need to know enough to delegate the work properly. 

Your boss and his colleague apparently joked it off, you probably should too. You are most likely making too much of this. But if you feel strongly enough that you must do something now, just tell your side of the story and leave it at that. How about "Hey, boss. I just wanted to tell you that I would never say such a thing. Apparently, my Dad thought he would be funny at my expense. I didn't know he was going to do that, otherwise I would have prevented it from happening, and I don't think it was very funny. Sorry." Then, either stop taking rides home from your Dad, or meet him outside. 

While interviewing, you should ask questions to learn about the company culture and to determine if the job and company fit your needs. If you have decided that you are not willing to work any overtime, then you must ask enough questions to learn if overtime will be expected, since that would mean you don't want this job. Instead of simply stating "I won't do overtime", you might want to ask "Tell me about the work hours here." And if necessary, push a bit and say "How often are people expected to work overtime?" From the company viewpoint, interviews are designed to see if you fit the job/role/company. Similarly, from your viewpoint, you need to see if what they are offering fits your needs. 

Yes. These are called sales leads. Find a company that sells such lists and purchase one. Something like $URL$ will help. (Note: I think what you are intending is a waste of time. But that wasn't your question.) 

You could do that as well, but it seems like overkill to appear in person. If you run into a wall, and cannot get any record of your pay, just be honest with your potential employer and say "I don't remember". Don't ever make up a salary - that's lying and not likely to be an attribute a new employer would prefer. 

You best bet is to specifically ask your boss "Is it okay if I wear headphones?" Then you will know for sure. If that isn't feasible, you could look around and see if your coworkers are wearing them, or just ask others in your office if this is acceptable. Absent that, one approach would be to wear them and see if anyone complains. 

It's certainly reasonable to ask "Tell me about this company's Acceptable Use policy?" That is basically a non-confrontational way to get much of the information you are seeking. At least for me as a hiring manager, there would be no negative effects. I can't speak for all other hiring managers, but in my network of friends, none of them would hold that against you either. That starts the conversation, and you can judge for yourself where you want to take it. You might want to probe deeper and ask specific questions about restrictions, monitoring, etc. Or you might sense that this line of questions isn't well received, in which case you can graciously back off. As @bethlakshmi correctly points out, not every manager will have a lot of details on hand about how employee internet use monitoring is done. In my experience, there is usually a written policy. That may not have lots of details, but often gives you the broad warnings about what the company expects, and what they may choose to do. If challenged and if you are feeling nervous, you can always follow up with something along the lines of "I like to do some work from home after hours. I'm basically wondering if I can use my own computer to access the corporate network, or if I'll be required to use a company-provided computer?" 

It's perfectly reasonable to ask if they will cover your expenses. The company already knows that you are not local. If the company really wants you to interview in person, I would expect them to be willing to cover the cost for doing so. They may even offer their corporate travel department to help make arrangements for you. But even if they decline to cover your costs, they won't think you unreasonable by asking about it. Just ask before you commit to the interview, and hope they agree. Be ready with what you will do in the off chance that they decide not to cover the costs. 

You haven't misled him, you are just relaying what you know in a changing situation. I've had this happen to folks that work for me. On one occasion, he had to go back to India, and was away for a month. It happens. He was able to do a small bit of remote work - I really appreciated the effort. Because of that, and because he had always worked hard, I was able to pay him for most of the days even though he exhausted his paid time off for the year. As a manager, I understand how these things work. You need to deal with your family situation first, and worry about work second. Keep your boss in the loop, and he'll appreciate it. 

You could add this. But it would probably be wasted there unless it ties in directly with the duties of the new job. 

The one word in your question that raises a red flag for me is "remote". Are you planning to work 80 hours per week and thus work these jobs back-to-back? Or are you planning to work at these jobs simultaneously, and end up with something more like a 40-hour week? If the former, and you truly meet the complete needs of both companies, it should probably be fine. People who work in an office often hold a side job (although not usually a full-time side job). But if you were planning to interweave both jobs and execute them simultaneously, I'd be very concerned. When I permit someone to work remotely, I'm expecting their full attention - just as I would if they were physically located in the office. Remote work isn't an opening for making extra money with your left hand while doing the work I assigned to you with your right - just as it isn't an opening for taking care of the children all day and only occasionally paying attention to your work. If you have told both companies how you plan to work these two jobs (whatever that plan might be), and they have both agreed - then you should be fine. As long as everyone agrees, then anything could work. But if you are reluctant to be completely honest with these two companies, then that says something about what you believe in your heart about your plan. I always recommend honesty. My advice is to ask both of your employers if this is permissible, and follow their directions.
