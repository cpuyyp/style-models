It's nearly impossible to say what employers as a whole value. There is an incredible amount of variation between employers and between different people in the same organization. Plus, a great deal will depend on the specific job role, the specific class, and the relationship between the two. Some employers and interviewers will completely discount any sort of MOOC certificate. Others may give you credit for demonstrating an interest in improving yourself-- I'd rather employ someone that's constantly evolving their skillset than someone that is comfortable where they are today. Whether that credit would be worth the time and money you'd invest in the course is something you'd need to determine for yourself and that you'd need to compare against alternatives like getting an industry certification. If an employer gives you credit for a MOOC certificate, a verified certificate is going to be more valuable than a free certificate it's just a question of how much more valuable. Occasionally, you may find a case where having a series of related MOOC certificates is highly beneficial to a particular candidate applying for a particular position at a particular company because you're demonstrating familiarity with a set of skills that is rare and in demand. For the most part, though, they're likely to have at best a small impact on whether you get the job. Of course, the verified certificates are usually pretty inexpensive as well so you'd have to decide for yourself whether the small financial cost is worth the likely small benefit. 

Are you sure that your current coverage stops the day you leave your current position? Most health insurance runs monthly so if you're leaving in the middle of the month, it's pretty common that your current company would already have paid for you through the end of the month. If you are sure that you'll actually have a gap, your options for covering a 2-day gap are pretty much the same as they would be for a 30-day gap. If you're in the US, you would generally have the option of using COBRA to continue your current coverage. You can potentially get added to your spouse's plan. You can go purchase an individual policy for a short period of time. Or you can elect to go uncovered for 2 days. 

If you always excel at the actual task at hand, I assume that means that you have a long list of former coworkers, managers, etc. that would enthusiastically recommend you. If that's the case, you probably need to reach out to that network to help you find opportunities and, more importantly, to recommend you for those opportunities. If you've demonstrated exceptional results in the past, there should be people out there in companies that you'd like to work for that would be equally excited to work with you. A hiring manager that has been told by a developer she works with on a daily basis that he personally vouches for the fact that you'll deliver amazing code is far more likely to take a risk on an unqualified candidate than is a hiring manager that is looking at a resume from a candidate that came from a random job posting. 

This is something that should be spelled out in the contract you have with the clients. If the client wants to own absolutely every line of code, they have to pay for its production, you have to re-implement the same functionality for the other client, and you can't use a common framework. If the client wants a lower cost, they don't get to own every line of code, you get to leverage code and frameworks from prior clients, and it would generally be appropriate to split the billing 50/50. 

Your resume is a marketing document. As such, it needs to quickly capture the reader's attention and it needs to emphasize the things that you actually accomplished. The people reading your resume are going to spend 30-60 seconds in most cases skipping through what you've written. You need to ensure that what you've written grabs their attention. Of course, most people don't write or talk this way in general. Often times, that's unfortunate-- the vast majority of business communication would be improved if people spent time making sentences more active (and working to eliminate extra words and working to come up with more concise summaries, etc.) But most people don't have (or want to spend) the time required to do that with every email they send. The fact that you have the time and incentive to optimize the way you communicate information in your resume doesn't make your resume inauthentic any more than optimizing a piece of code makes your normal, less efficient code inauthentic. Both are your authentic style, one just happens to be something that you've invested more time than normal to perfect. 

Ask your manager (or whoever coordinates travel for your company). This isn't really a question of appropriateness. It will depend on your company's policies and may well depend on either American or Israeli employment laws. I would wager that a multinational company that employs people in Israel would be pretty accustomed to accommodating this sort of religious requirement for employees that travel. I would expect that the company would probably have no problem covering the extra day (particularly when Sunday return flights tend to be less expensive than Saturday return flights). But that's not to say that your company's policies are less friendly. 

If it doesn't cost the company anything and imposes no liability, I can't envision any reason for people to have to ask permission to use the discount. Treat it just like any other fringe benefit of the job. In the other question, the concern was related to the fact that we had no idea how exactly the discount was structured. If the company was paying a fee for the discount or the company would be liable for damages or if there was some other potential downside for the company, it makes sense to ask for permission. In your case, there is no potential downside for the company so there is no reason to ask for permission.
