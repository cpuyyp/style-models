No it's not as effective. To gain mass weight is crucial. Supersetting may give you a great workout and can certainly be used to push over a plateau or be used on light days or whatever - it can be a useful tool. But it cannot be a long-term solution for weight. Doing this your gains are going to be slow and your body will just get used to doing that exercise quicker. Expect to burn more calories and possibly produce more definition but do not expect to make gains quick. Your suggested routine is something someone that is fully produced would do to maintain. If you are looking at getting bigger this would be a light or one-off day but you still need the heavy days in your routine. 

Allows for better progression. Easy to add 2.5 lb weights to each side. We actually have 1.5 pound collars used for progression lifts at the school gym. Helps focus on larger muscle groups. If you squatted with dumbbells there would be a lot of additional muscle groups supporting the weight being held. Easier to use when you get to heavier weights. Loading 150lb dumbbells on your chest to do inclines is a chore. I think getting these on my chest was half the battle. Very easy to load a bar up and sit down. Allows you to do more weight. If you squat 600lbs good luck finding the dumbbells you need. There are certain lifts that are hard to do efficiently with dumbbells. Think cleans, snatches, good mornings, skull crushers (I hate the dummbbell version)... Very expensive and takes a lot of space to do a dumbbell only solution. If you do any competitions - they don't use dumbbells. Dumbbells are always working out your fingers, hands, wrist, and forearms. 

First there is nothing wrong with your muscles shaking. You are making them work and have good intensity. That is great. Some reasons for the muscle shakes: 

In fact all of these "power lifting/strength" programs basically work off of the same premise which has always been known to those in the industry. 

What would you say to a teenager about the use of enhancing drugs apart from the medical conditions that could arise from use? 

I wouldn't suggest do kneeling cable crunches unless you need the advanced weight to actually engage your abdominal muscles - meaning you are a very advanced lifter or body builder. Anytime that your have that much contact with the floor to settle your body - knees and feet in this case - the more the weight is distributed. In fact I would strongly suggest that this lift is often done improperly engaging in too many muscles outside of the abs. I considered myself very advanced with ab workouts and wouldn't touch these. I don't want to over-generalize but I feel my hip abductors and shoulders getting a workout - not good. If you really want to work your abs out - get your feet (and knees) off the floor. 

The main issue with a Full Body workout is that you only have so much "maximum energy" to perform lifts. Therefore only the first few body parts or lifts that you do will have maximum impact. Being very general I would train full body for endurance or explosion movements (plyometrics, speed drills, athletic training, rehab). By focusing on specific Muscle Groups during a specific training session you ensure that not only will you have the energy to put forth maximum effort but you will also have the adequate amount of time to devote. Therefore breaking down the muscle group enough that when it recovers it will be stronger. A few key components when deciding what is right for you: 

Flexibility can be had. There is little cap on your flexibility based on past non-flexibility. The two basics of flexibility is how often your muscles are stretched (in a variety of ways) and genetics. Gains are very small and incremental. However the good news is that you have done little weight training in your life and you don't have to worry about muscles getting in the way. 

So all of these programs including Starting Strength focus on shorter, "easier" workouts. Because they are playing on the fact that a person will more likely work on intensity if they aren't overwhelmed by reps/sets/time commitment. In reality most/all of the programs will give the beginner a good base given that they are only doing powerlifting at first. I have trained countless young men and I have seen similar gains (going from 100 pound to 300 pound deadlift in 4-5 months). A lot of the gains are simply getting used to the technique and the lift itself. A lot have to do with gaining weight/muscle at a rate only a beginner could. These workouts do work because they focus on the lifts that work the best and intensity. My big problem with the routines is that a lot people think they are for everyone. I have a hard time suggesting these routines for someone that is already active or is not a beginner. And again the beginner market is probably 98% of the general population. As far as your concerns... That the lifts given are dangerous. I agree to a large extent. The average person will have bad form after reading the book. I have to do a lot of training to younger kids to get them squatting right. But the fact is they want hype. They want to be able to show big gains and these movements are crucial to that. If you don't do the core movements your gains will take forever in comparison. That the lifts are not for everyday life. True again. And mentioned before this is my big concern. If you continued down this path forever you would be a big, slow-twitch, hulk. If you want functional strength I could see doing this routine for 2-3 months tops to get someone started. You will need to incorporate more fast-twitch movement, endurance weight training, simulation movements, plyometrics... 

Given - Outdoor - Completely flat, little wind, similar surface (let's say a rubber track) Indoor - Treadmill flat, same temp as outside, mph/kph calibration is correct (this is hard to prove or disprove but if you are an experienced runner you know if it is wrong) NOTE** Just because a treadmill is on a flat floor doesn't mean you are running on level. Also - and more common - just because a treadmill is on a LEVEL floor doesn't mean the "0" level is actually level. I have seen both inclined and declined slopes for this. I have worked out at a gym where the owner kept the desirable (good location/tv) treadmills inclined on "0" so the heavy runners wouldn't use them. Then they are the same. I have worked with people that have had faster treadmill times and others that have had faster outdoor times. It is really in their head. Personally I have the attitude that I will do anything I am "made" to do so I think I am faster on the treadmill - yes it is in my head too. Others get sick on treadmills and need to run outside. The question is very very similar to saying do you run faster on a track or road running? People have the same variances. The 1-2% incline comment. This comes from road racers. From the road racing/marathon community they believe setting the incline to 1-2% should mimic times they would get on average when out on the road. In theory it is probably right on average but a better tool would be going between -5 to 5% to mimic the hills you will face - I know that is only possible with very high end treadmills. Just like the outdoor winds and hills and rough road conditions you may face you can also face indoor conditions. I have ran in small rooms where I could tell the oxygen levels had depleted during my run, I personally can't stand running in humid rooms, I run slower with a video screen in front of me... We all have our likes and dislikes. If I had my way I would be in a room at 50F with little humidity at 1 PM. Unless your goal is marathons or longer road racing you do not need to make an adjustment on your treadmill. If your treadmill times are vastly different from outdoor times I would try a few other treadmills to make sure the calibration isn't throwing you off. If the times are still different then you need to see if there is something you can do to help your "slow area". If your outdoor times are slower are you sure the running area is flat, are you sure about the distances, do you like where you run, are there obstacles, do you run at the same time of day compared to indoor, how is the weather??? If you are really really concerned then count your strides on a treadmill for one mile/2km. Is it roughly the same outside for the same distance (and don't trust all outdoor signs that give you distance info). If your strides are the same that means that you are actually running faster on the treadmill (which is not a negative thing) and you need to push yourself outside more. If your strides are different you may need to work on lengthening your stride outside. 

And I would suggest looking into seeing a chiropractor that specializes in seeing athletes. I have a great one in my area. He not only treats my lower back issues but also sets realistic boundaries for me. Every doctor I saw gave me a laundry list of things I couldn't do. Their goal seemed to be that I never have to see them again - not that I will enjoy my life. 

I am pretty sure that your teacher is telling you to get your shoulders back (don't hunch over) and stand straight up. You don't need to flex anything though. But when you are doing something like marching (think Army) you need to have your back straight and perpendicular to the ground, your steps need to firm. If your posture is bad when you normally walk it will take practice. And of you should feel a little out of breath keeping your body in a position you are not used to, especially when doing something else. 

You didn't run your 30 yard dash in 3.54 seconds. You didn't even come remotely close. If someone gave you that time seriously both you and them are deluded. You would be one of the fastest 15 year-olds in the world if your ran a 3.9-4.0, and I seriously doubt you can come close to 4 seconds. Your supposed time translates to around a 4.1 40 yard dash which would break Deion Sanders combine record (if Bo doesn't own the record). 

First I would question your ab routine. Basically there are two ways to target abs. 1 - Using a high amount of resistance. 2 - Doing a lot of reps at high intensity. Your abs are small muscles, especially if you have not worked them out very long. Every other day is probably a good routine amount. If you are in the beginning phases of ab workouts (first 2-3 months) then you should be a little sore to very sore the next day. Another tip for abs - if you are doing an exercise where your feet are on the floor or attached to something then a good amount of work is probably being done by other muscle groups. Let's talk about some of the other things:
