Well, rent control is the classic example used in many economics textbooks when talking about price ceilings. A price ceiling is a maximum price one can pay for a good, and is set by a governing body. There are many cons to price ceilings and not many pros. $\textbf{Pros:}$ 1) Because tenants of the property know that apartments are in short supply, they will have an incentive to take good care of the place in order to stay on the renter's good side because they may not be able to get another apartment if they get kicked out of this one. 2) Tenants who get apartments will have lower rent costs and will therefore be able to spend/save more of their money. If they choose to spend it, that can boost the local economy because more money will be spent in local businesses. $\textbf{Cons:}$ The graph above depicts a binding rent control. By this, I mean that the rent controlled price is below the equilibrium price. In this example, the rent controlled price is $1,000$ and the equilibrium price is $1,500$. What this causes is a shortage of apartments. Looking at this graph, we can see that at the price of $1,000$, $Q_D=2,100,000$ and $Q_S=1,900,000$. Using this, we can see that the shortage will be: $$Q_D-Q_S=2,100,000-1,900,000=200,000\;apartments$$ What this means in words is that there are more people who want apartments than there are people who are willing to supply apartments. What might be the side effects of this? 1) Rationing: There are a couple of ways rationing may occur, but in the market for apartments the only way which makes sense is rationing through discrimination by sellers biases. What this means is that the renter may give the apartment to someone who doesn't value it as much as another person based on their biases. 2) Illegal activities: One thing which may occur due to rent control is under-the-table deals. Basically, people may pay the seller some money under the table to ensure that they get an apartment. 3) Homelessness or relocation: We need to look at what we mean by the quantity of apartments demanded is greater than the quantity of apartments supplied. What this means is that people who want/need to buy apartments will not be able to (in our example 200,000 people at least). What are the two outcomes of this? The first outcome would be homelessness because people cannot get apartments, and they may have nowhere else to go. The reason why this is not desirable is pretty obvious (we don't want people to have to live on the streets). The second outcome would be relocation of current residents. What this means is that people will need to move out of the area. This will hurt the local economy because less people will be spending their money in local businesses. One last thing to keep in mind is that over time this shortage will get worse. In the short run, the sellers may not be able to take the apartment off the market. However, in the long run, sellers may decide to sell the apartment complex, which will cause the supply of apartments to decrease even more. This will exacerbate the problems I listed above. $\textbf{Edit:}$ Another problem caused by rent controls was mentioned (quite astutely) by $\textbf{AdamBailey}$. He pointed out that landlords may not make enough money to maintain his or her rental properties, and over time the quality of such rental properties may depreciate drastically. This shows that, not only will the quantity of apartments decrease, but the quality may decrease as well. This is another perfect example of how rent controls can hurt those that it is trying to help. 

Once again, let $p$ denote very high price; say, $\$30$ per ticket. Then if tickets are sold at price $p$, quantity demanded will still be pretty high (because the whole curve has shifted up), so revenue will be pretty high, maybe revenue will equal one billion dollars, so therefore it probably makes sense to spend the initial 500 million to make the movie, so quantity supplied will be strictly more than $0$ units. This is kind of weird, right? Its as if every time demand changes, we have to change the supply curve, too. Looking at it another way, supply isn't purely a function of price-per-unit; its also a function of the demand curve. 

Lets make the simplifying assumption that this film will cost exactly 500 million dollars to make. Assume the demand curve looks something like this: 

I hold the opinion that the notion of opportunity cost "muddies the intellectual waters" so to speak, and I'd like to know if any professional economists have expressed this sentiment, or similar. 

Okay, now lets think about supply. Let $p$ denote very high price; say, $\$30$ per ticket. Assume, in particular, that $p$ is far toward the right-hand-side of our graphs, where the quantity demanded is very low. Then if tickets are sold at price $p$, quantity demanded will be very low, so revenue from the film will be very low, so it won't be worth spending the 500 million to make the movie, so quantity supplied will be exactly $0$ units. Now consider a demand-side shift. Perhaps some well-known film critic publishes her paradigm-shattering thesis on why the Matrix Sequels were, in point of fact, the best sequels of all time. This causes the demand curve to shift up: 

Government spending is the spending by the government on goods and services (non-capital goods). This means that the government buying physical capital would not be included in government spending, and would be included in investment spending. 

Well, the name pretty much says it all. I have searched high and low, but I cannot find a concrete answer to the following question(s): How would one interpret the incidence rate ratio for a poisson regression with a non-binomial dependent variable? Also, can this be generalized? i.e. will the interpretation be the same for any count model or does it differ by model? 

It sounds like you could simply use the Cost Minimization Problem: $$\underset{z_1,...z_N}{min}\sum_{i=1}^N q_iz_i$$ $$s.t.\quad f(z_1,...,z_N)\geq \bar{y}$$ $$z_1,...z_n\geq0$$ Where $z_i$ and $q_i$ are the quantity and price of input $i$, respectively, $\bar{y}$ is some predetermined level of output, and $f(\frac{}{})$ is the production function. A production function relates physical output of a production process to factors of production. Of course, it seems to me that it may be a challenge to characterize a production function for your case. However, the production function can be any function which satisfies the following: 1) Strict Monotonicity: If $ z'>z$ then $f(z')>f(z)$ 2) Quasi-concavity: $V(y)=\{ z:f(x)\geq y\}$ is a convex set 3) $V(y)$ is closed and non-empty 4) $f(z)$ is finite, nonnegative, real valued, and single valued $\forall z\geq 0$ 5) $f(z)$ is a $C^2$ function To be more specific to your case (data is the input and output) the problem reduces to: $$\underset{d_i}{min}\; d_iq+wl+rk$$ $$s.t.\quad f(d_i)\geq \bar{d_o}$$ $$d_i,l,k\geq 0$$ Where $d_i$ is the data used as input, $d_o$ is the data output, $q$ is the price of input data, $w$ is wage, $l$ is labor hours, $r$ is the rental price of capital and $k$ is quantity of capital. Again, this type of production process is foreign to me, so I cannot make an informed suggestion regarding specification of the production function, but maybe someone who is more apt on this site may offer a suggestion. I hope this helps! 

I was using the PORT optimization routines as proposed by Gay (1990)“Usage Summary for Selected Optimization Routines”. I searched online and in the paper, but I couldn't find any particular listed advantages/disadvantages of the method f.e. regarding speed, convergence, reliability, robustness etc. Does anyone have an idea? 

So I am trying to understand the impact of the elasticity of substitution in terms of taxation. I am carrying this out for the U.S. by firstly estimating a two-input CES production function. Chirinko (2002, $URL$ proposed that the elasticity of substitution between capital and labor is one of the channels that determine the effectivity of tax policy. I understood that for example considering a horizontal, completely elastic demand function tax policy can be very effective to increase capital stock since firms demand is characterized by great substitutability. Now here is my first question, does the elasticity of substitution sigma (of the examined country) have to theoretically be necessarily above unity, since only then the goods are substitutes, or is it possible to have an effective tax policy even though the elasticity of substitution is smaller than unity and the goods are rather complements. My second question would be if there is a way to influence the size of the elasticity of substitution towards a more effective tax policy. It might be somehow stated in the paper I linked above, but I didn't understand it then. Is there a way and tax policy (and through what kind of taxes) can maybe rise that elasticity of substitution through f.e. price incentives so it can make it itself more effective? 

According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, approximately 35% of adults in the United States are obese. I have done much research on the topic of economic policies to reduce obesity (I did a fat tax simulation for my undergraduate capstone thesis). I have run into three proposals: 1) Fat Tax: A fat tax is a tax on fatty foods or on fats themselves. Various papers I read on the topic simulated a tax on certain fatty foods. However, one paper proposed an ad valorem tax on saturated fats which seems like the most effective way to target fats. The biggest problem found with fat taxes is that fatty foods are very inelastic. This means that a tax won't change consumption much, so this doesn't seem like an effective option. 2) Thin Subsidy: A thin subsidy is pretty much the opposite of a fat tax. It subsidizes foods that are considered healthy. In the literature, this option by itself doesn't change behavior much, but a thin subsidy can also be paired with a fat tax. Basically, the government would use all of the revenues from the fat tax to subsidize healthy foods. When paired together, they are more effective than they are separately, but they still are not very effective in reducing calorie intake. 3) Gym Membership Tax Credit: This is a tax credit you can receive if you have a gym membership. I have not seen as much literature on this topic. Intuitively, if the tax credit is equal to or close to being equal to the cost of the membership, then people may have more incentive to get a gym membership. However, if the credit isn't very close to the cost of the membership, it may not cause people to go get memberships. Another problem with this method is that someone may get a membership and simply not go to the gym. I know most gyms have scanners now, so one remedy could be that the tax credit amount could depend on how many days you scan in. Other than these three policies, are there any other policies being discussed to slow the trend of obesity? How effective can a policy be in reducing obesity rates? 

Let me illustrate with an example. Define a function $f : \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ as follows: $$f(x) = 3-x^2$$ Pretend we get to choose $x,$ and that the resulting payoff is $f(x)$. Then obviously, the optimal choice of $x$ is $x=0$, and this gives a payoff (or "benefit", or "utility") of $3$. Seems simple enough. Okay, but now look what happens once we admit opportunity cost into the issue. It could be argued that by choosing $x=0$ and getting a payoff of $3$, we forgo the benefit associated with choosing $x=1$ at getting a payoff of $2$. So the true payoff of choosing $x=0$, once opportunity costs have been factored in, is at most $3-1$, which is $2$. Proceeding in this way, we can show that the true payoff, after subtracting all the relevant opportunity costs, is at most $3-(3-\varepsilon^2)$, for any choice of $\varepsilon$, no matter how small. Hence the true payoff is at most $\varepsilon^2$ for each choice of $\varepsilon$. So under the viewpoint of opportunity cost, the true payoff of choosing $x=0$ is not $3$, its $0$. The is a general principle; if we take the concept of opportunity cost seriously, then every continuous decision problem (involving continuous functions) has a maximum payoff of at most $0$, and most choices actually yield a negative payoff. Obviously, this is pretty artificial. With discrete problems, its even worse; the maximum payoff of any decision is vastly reduced, but its only $0$ at the second-best choice(s); the best choice(s) yield a positive payoff. Anyway, I'd like to know whether any professional economists have ever argued against using this concept. 

If this were to occur, there are three things we need to look at. 1) Will production occur? 2) Without wages, how will households make money? 3) What will be the welfare effects? $\textbf{1)}$ To answer the first question, if we assume that capital replaced all labor, we are assuming that capital and labor are substitutes which means that the production function will have the following form: $$F(k,l)=\alpha k+\beta l$$ What this means is that if $l=0$, $F(k,l)$ will still be greater than zero, so production will still occur. $\textbf{2)}$ To answer the second question, we can look at how households make money. Households make money from wages, and they make money from owning a fraction of firms (so they get that fraction of the profits the firm makes). All firms are owned by households (either through stocks or private ownership). The typical income of a household looks like the following: $$Y(\frac{}{})=wl+\theta\Pi$$ Where $w$ is wages, $l$ is labor hours, $\theta$ is the fraction of firms which the household owns, and $Pi$ is those firms' profits. If $l=0$, our income reduces to $Y(\frac{}{})=\theta\Pi$ One thing that immediately comes to mind is "without wages, won't all households' income decrease?" Well, we don't know for sure. According to economic theory, the reason the automation will have occurred is because it will cost less. What this means is that profit will increase, so $\theta\Pi$ will also increase. It really depends on whether $\Delta\theta\Pi$ is larger than, smaller than, or equal to $wl$. $\textbf{3)}$ The welfare effects are where we run into problems. When we look at the equation for income of a household, we can conduct a thought experiment: How does the fraction of income attributed to each term change when in different income groups? In the highest income groups, most of their income will come from $\theta\Pi$. An example of this would be the show SharkTank. In this show, companies come to the very wealthy "sharks" looking for capital, and in turn, they often offer a share of their company. Now, when we think about lower income groups, where does most of their income come from? Well, most of their income comes from wages because they cannot afford to save money (and therefore invest in stocks or entrepreneurship). What would happen as a result from full automation, we would theoretically see the income inequality grow to be even larger than it currently is. This is a very undesirable result. 

So I am currently trying to write a paper estimating the Constant Elasticity of Substitution Production Function of the USA. I am using the simple version with two inputs capital and labour. Since the estimation is at the aggregate level I thought of using the perpetual inventory method to create the data for aggregate capital, but I wasnt sure what kind of data I need for aggregate labour. Maybe the number of employed people, work force, in the USA? I'd be glad if someone could help me out. 

I'm currently on my paper about estimating a CES function for the USA. I use a regular two input function with capital and labour. I would then use nonlinear estimation methods aswell as the kmenta approximation method to derive the parameters. But here's my question: I'm kinda lost in how I need to collect the data and my professor is not really helpful in that manner. Since I'm estimating at the aggregate level it feels kinda hard to get data for broad terms such as capital and labour. If anyone has a suggestion on how and where i can collect the data for those two inputs Id be glad. I'm really kinda lost since in the papers where authors estimated elasticities the authors are really sloppy in explaining how they actually read in the data. I found data sets such as the WOID database and such but usually these are sectoral and since im interested in the aggregate I'm really insecure in how to proceed
