Demons coming from another planet prove doesn't prove or disproved hell, heaven and the afterlife. It only proves demon-like creatures do exist, and there's a place whence they come. Religious texts and mythology are mostly figurative, sometimes partly based on truth. Maybe the truth here is that aliens visited Earth once, and they really weren't nice guys, and then they went on their merry way because "meh, not hellish enough, 2/10, would not raid again" or something. Here hell would be figurative for "wherever these things came from, which must be a really bad place". The guys who wrote the Bible never saw hell, nor did the Greeks. It just serves to tell you "don't sin", or more generally "be nice", otherwise hell awaits. If religion is prevalent, then demons coming to Earth would support claims that sinning is really bad and unleashes the apocalypse. So that would likely make religious power even more powerful because people like salvation. If religion isn't prevalent, it may not change much. If we're advanced enough to fathom life on other planets and interplanetary travel, we'll probably assume that demons where created after these things. In any case, it might sparkle interest in religion, though whether people will take it at face value or not is hard to guess. 

Elemental weapons are quite common in video games, and I'm interested in writing those types of weapons in a setting of realistic consequences. However, I am having troubles justifying the existence of "freezing" weapons. While lightning infused weapons can stop a heart even with a glancing blow and fire infused weapons increases the likelihood of painful and fatal infections, making an enemy very very cold seems underwhelming compared to simply lacerating their muscles, breaking their bones, and having them bleed to death. At the moment, having a frost-infused weapon seems more frivolous than practical. Assuming that magically infusing a weapon with the ability to absorb heat or stop the ambient motion of molecules (aka destroying the heat) requires an additional investment of either time or materials, why would a freezing weapon be a worthwhile investment for a combatant? For the sake of simplicity, I am specifically referring to weapons (and, to a lesser extent, tools) of a feudal era civilization. Also, this question is a blatant rewording of this one, which seems to have been put on an indefinite hold for the time being. Specifying a particularly effective type/shape for a freezing weapon would be appreciated, but I realize that is difficult without specific rules in place. 

A lot of answers seem to involve either suicide or pre-programmed self-termination. Both of those seem like valid options for a robot to seek water, but, by itself, it doesn't explain why they would build towns by water. However, if river are known as a place where robots go to die, it would make total since for non-fatalistic robots to settle there. Think of it as a suicide prevention effort. Robots "camp" around rivers to keep depressed or recently dropped off robots from ending their lives in the water, or at least try and talk them out of it. After all, it makes sense for robots to value the lives of fellow robots enough to inconvenience themselves with seasonal floods. Other than that, a waterwheel could be used to power a blacksmith's billows, which they would probably need for performing general repairs. Still, a billows could be operated by hand if the blacksmith doesn't have to do that much work, so that might not gel with your town's level of industrialization. Personally, I think a great reason for building near rivers would be trade, specifically trade with human smugglers. For the sound of it, humans are banned from the Robot Plain. However, if the robots found or make something of value, like maybe turquoise jewelry or rare earth minerals, they could trade with humans for useful items, like rainproof clothing or replacement parts. So you have an incentive for smugglers and a black market. Cars and airplanes are easily spotted by authorities, but boats or smuggling submarines can sneak onto the Robot Plain, so permanent settlement must be build on rivers. 

The following plan is based around one idea: you can't escape if the murder is discovered. That's rule one. There are no other rules. They are obviously paranoid about security. If there is an unresolved murder in the base, fat chance getting on that transport. See rule one. Their security system is, for all intents and purposes, undefeatable. 24/7 monitoring through implants mean you can't escape surveillance. Chances are the only way to get a decent window of opportunity would be to destroy the security. I'll refer to rule one on that, unless... Unless you conceal why the system was destroyed. There's a French saying: the more obvious the lie, the more believable. There are very little things more obvious than full frontal assault. And if you make a good attempt at it, it will look like your only objective. 

At minimum, we need to disable defense sensors and/or targeting systems. A cannon that cannot find its target is as good as destroyed in our case. 

If they are ubiquitous, one could assume the cost of robot-cops (totally not a trademark) is a solved problem. If you want to make a fair comparison, you must account for the price of training a human, their equipment, their retirement, their hospital bills or funeral, and maybe the checks sent to their families. Why robots over humans? You can train a robot much faster. If the robot dies, you can transfer its databanks to a new one. They are typically superior to humans in terms of strength, speed and reflexes. Intellectually, they can process more information, and access any data in the system on the spot, which is an interesting trait for a detective. They can also operate 24/7 without having to pay overtime. Lack of morality is an interesting point, one that can also be found in humans. On one hand, there's the cold logic of a robot's programming, which drives them to make the "right" choice, depending on their programming. On the other hand, human can blatantly disregard human life. In a number of countries, police corruption is a big problem. You can't corrupt a robot. Related to the previous point, robots have no second thought. If there is a danger, they are more likely to dive into it if it means saving a life, whereas a human would rightfully so fear for their own lives. In case of an injury, a robot can get repaired and get back in active duty much faster as well. And because they have no strong feeling one way or the other, they might not kill a kid on sight because he's black. Why not robots over human? In the present, humans aren't really ready to trust robots with their lives. Likely, that doesn't change much in the future, so first contact would probably be cold. Human-cyborg relations would probably get better over time though. Security would be a major concern, the possibility of your police force switching off or turning against you is a frightening one. However, as the hacking capabilities of bad guys increase, so does cybersecurity. You can take steps to mitigate the risks of hostile takeover. Ultimately, the common criminals will likely lack the proper skill to hotwire high-tech machinery so the real threat is organized crime, which is already known to bribe/threaten police officers. There is still no such thing as zero risk, so it comes down to how acceptable the risk is versus the risk of humans losing control of themselves. Another thing to consider is that if they'll be chasing human criminals, then a human mind might be a better frame of reference. Humans are most likely to better understand how a human criminal think than a robot would. Conclusion A favorable environment I think would be high crime rates and/or high probability of getting your skin shot. In that case, a replaceable police force would make sense. Another possible scenario would be lack of trust in human police. If your police force is known for its corruption, then a robot might be a better sight than a cop. What I would recommend is to have humans and robots doing the job together, as opposed to one or the other. They both have strengths and weaknesses, so going one way may solve some problems while creating other. A last point I'd like to make is that police is supposed to protect and serve the public. In an ideal world, financial considerations shouldn't matter as long as the public service is effective. But you know, that's ideally speaking. 

Well, for starters, generating heat wouldn't result in any force being generated. In this set up, its not so much the heat or fire propelling your character as much as him continually making explosions. Think achieving flight by the recoil of firearms. Right off the bat, he would have to be capable of withstanding that kind of explosive force being generated right next to his body. Using explosive power has other issues for his surroundings. Generating that much force might damage this characters surroundings, but probably not too much more than a helicopter (I'm guessing that last bit. Aerodynamics is not something I know anything about). The real problem would be the noise. Having a character achieve flight by combustion would be louder than an un-muffled motorcycle and would be sure to wake the neighbors. No way he could be able to sneak up on anyone while flying. A simpler but less ideal solution is for him to heat (and cool down if possible) air in order to manufacture updrafts. Then he can make hang-gliders that never have to touch the ground or reverse-parachutes. It's very gadget-y, but would be plausible and make your character look cleaver. 

I'm uncomfortable putting "nano-tech" and "melee weapon" in the same sentence for the same reason I don't think nuclear fusion handguns would catch on. Its over-designing to the point of being dangerous. That being said, saying your device works by applied magnetism could be interesting. Maybe the protagonist has a device that can fuse metal shavings into programmable shapes? That could explain the malleability without the chance of a grey goo indecent. Only downside would be turning the new shapes back into metal shavings. It would probably be easier just to throw the old shape away and make a new one from scratch. Basically I'm talking about a tools that arranges the parts (metal shavings) and fusing them together with magnetism. Or, if you want to avoid pseudo-science of super accurate and portable electromagnets, have the character carry a suitcase-sized 3d printer. The printer could scan objects, then replicate them. All it could need is to be reloaded with materials whenever it ran out. While this goes beyond the scope of the question, justifying this device in-universe could be interesting. No offence to martial artists or swordsmen, but long ranged armaments seems like the way of the future, so a hyper-advanced melee weapon is an odd tool to see. I can totally imagine a character custom ordering one for a specific task, but his mechanic/engineer would still look at him/her funny. However, the ability to get custom-made tools on the fly would be fantastic if you are a mechanic. With a machine like Budhaditya described or the gizmos I talked about, you could make wrenches of any size, parts to replace any broken ones, and any kind of tool you could imagine. Then, when the character is in trouble, they could find one of these in-universe multi-tools and program it to make simple weapons. Oh, and countering this weapon would probably best be done by shooting the character holding it with a gun or gun-adjacent object. 

There are a lot of answers and I tried to look for this idea, but I didn't find it, so. The god is testing his followers. He wonders about his followers. How long until they find out? Who will find out? A lowly monk or a high priest? Are the leaders of the church able to notice? If not are they still worthy of their position? What will be the reason for noticing the impostor? Will somebody be jealous of how quickly is the impostor rising in ranks? Or will they find flaws in his teachings and expose him? What if the impostor exposes the evils within the hearts of the god's followers? It could be just a lesson for the followers, so when something like a succubus tries to enter, they will know. Or the other god is trying to prove that noble god's followers are blind with pride or that some are evil. The god is truly noble, so he will not interfere and let the truth be revealed. Then there is the possibility that the real world could be radically changed if the god would interfere directly, so he asked other gods for help. 

At the core of every virtue stands a sin a negative behavior. Some sins may seem as opposites of other virtues, but the virtues themselves contain at its core a reason for existence, a sin. Humble beings can still take pride in their way of life or despise the Prideful. Some names sins are simply other feelings brought to the extreme. Lust is just an uncontrolled desire, a need to seek pleasure. Lust provides same emotion as Love and compassion, they are different only in nuances that are never set in stone. Lust is often described as selfish, while commpassion spreads the pleasure, but it doesn't have to be that way. Greed - Gathering riches takes them out of circulation, weakening the economy. So "gathering gold and not willing to share it" is a sin. But having a large sum at hand is still handy for organisations and states. Dragons may gather gold, but what do they want it for, they are intelligent, they know it is useless to them. But what if they plan to use those funds to restore their empire or to build temples, hospitals, monasteries, libraries, orphanages? What if they gather gold so that when a famine or a great war comes, they can protect the people in their domain from harm? Gathering wealth is a sin only if there is no purpose. Generosity is a greater sin disguised as a virtue. It encourages people to give away the wealth they earned and allows the others to stop striving for more, to progress. It promotes sloth. greed -> prosperity Keeping a constant flow of money, seeking to gain more with each trade and each contract and investing to gain more can help the economy. If the money flows it allows others to reach for that money. If one man builds a dam all others get less, if a man allows the river to flow they all get as much as they can carry in their buckets. Those who allow the money to flow are still wealthy, yet they do not restrict the others to gain as well. Pride - pride can be decomposed into many things. Bravery, ambition, courage, loyalty, respect, trust. Pride can lead to doom, but the humble can also doom themselves. Many brave died at the hands of the enemy, yet the cowards let the others die instead of them. The ambitious can fall into a trap, because they look too far ahead and don't see what is beneath their feet. The loyal can take pride in their service and take their life when they loose this pride they call "honor". Many people take praise their country and are proud of their leaders and respect them. Lust - Desire, love, pleasure, commpassion, joy, fun, humor. Many positive emotions can be a part of lust. It is only a way of achieving that emotion and to what end, that makes it evil. Envy - It is the emotion that forces the others to keep up with the best. If they kick down the Prideful it is only their fault that they didn't try to stand up again. If they steal from the Greedy or kick the Slothful down from their beds, they always force the others and themselves to keep up with the rest. The envious are agents of progress, just as the slothful. Envy is what defines success and failure. And often the envious switch to a different sin, when they achieved their goal. Sloth - They don't want to work, they instead try to find a way how to avoid it. They are inventors, but also slavers (just as the Prideful can be). They drive the progress, they find new ways for the others, or they simply want to share their laziness. Gluttony - They are Hedonistic, free, rebellious, they seek luxury and quantity at the same time. They are the ones who create plantages and mass produce, so the luxurious can be common. They search new ways to exploit the universe, find new ways to replicate the existing.(The Greedy would never do so unless they can not gain more in that way. But the Gluttonous do not care.) Wrath - Wrathful are the needle in the back of shemers, they act on a impulse. They act NOW when it is needed, they have no fear, they have no regrets. Wrath may pose as bravery, vengeance, justice. Wrath is the impulse that led to the virtues. Wrath is a reaction to injustice it is the counter to every other sin or virtue going too far. It can even stop itself, Hate is Wrath in the extreme and Hate also wakes up wrath in those who suffer because of hate. So all sin and virtues can become evil. The feelings the words do not matter, they way they were achieved and their cause is what matters. 

IFF technology was developped in WWII. Basically, a transmitter asks for identification, receiver answers and if it checks out, congrats, you're a friendly. It only detects friendly unit, the rest is likely assumed hostile. It seems to me like the best way to approach this without resorting to future tech. IFF in aircrafts use radio waves for transmission. Water, however, is not air and radio waves have much more limited range. That's why ships use sonar (sound waves) rather than radar for underwater detection. However, the need for sonar is simply because your average ship needs to detect other ships, which are typically far away, or at least much further than the range of an underwater radar. In this case, you only need to detect mine before contact, which may be only a few meters. So reusing the system as is might work. I can't really help you if you need technical details of what wavelength to use, that's out of my realm. I can't see why the system couldn't be adapted for underwater use though. Bear in mind, you'd need to power your IFF somehow. I'm not up to date on the history of batteries or wave power, so that's a thing you should look up too. Now assuming your mine can identify friendlies, all it would need to do is not explode when receiving IFF signal. I would suggest preventing detonation by physically locking the mechanism. That would mean receiving identification before contact. It wouldn't be flawless however. 

Putting armour directly on the wings probably won't be too plausible. They would weight them down, might limit their mobility, and would defiantly be exhausting. I'm imagining flying armour on your wings would be like climbing a rope with heavy weights on your wrists. While I think your character wouldn't want to engage in hand to hand at all (flying out of weapons range and dropping hazardous objects would be hard for an enemy to counter), there could be ways to protect their wings on the ground. What about a thick cape reinforced with chain mail netting? Sure, they couldn't fly with it on, but they could carry if in a sack and put it on when they land. If the wings can fold into a way convenient for fitting through doors, this might be enough to keep them safe in a melee. If the cape alone can't provide enough defense, what about a solid metal "shell" shield that's worn like a backpack? Just unbuckle the shell when you need to escape into the air! This post is inspired by whenever I put my coat over my backpack when walking in the rain. 

I have a planned species of aliens that have many commonalities with longhorn crazy ants (cooperation with colonies of the same species, can live in a large variety of environments, and have the ability to have genetic variation with a low number of breeding pairs). They are humanoid bipeds with exoskeletons as well as pseudo-endoskeletons, lungs and hearts to pump blood, and regulate heat by a series of capillaries in their mouths (basically just panting like a dog). Individual physical power, as a whole, isn't that much more than a human. Socially, their "family" units consist of a female queen, a male drone, and twenty to fifty sexless workers (depending on the sub-species). Its like if an entire tribe operates as a single organism, while all having independent minds. Finally, they have the ability to cooperate with other families to form cities, nations, and empires. After a few millennia of advancement, this species took to space. My question is: what kind of home-world would this species evolve on? Even with my additions to make them environmental generalists, I got no idea how human-sized insects could exist in the first place. I would love to be able to include details about native cuisine and interesting animals they might take with them to space, but at the moment I'm stumped.
