The ethical dilemma is not on your end; the ethical issue is what should the company do. They set a deadline, and now they are considering allowing an exception to that deadline. While they do want to make sure they get qualified candidates, they don't want to run the risk that they never make a decision. If they always reopen the system for late applications they can convince themselves that next week the perfect candidate will apply. They also risk that a candidate will claim the constantly shifting process was discriminatory. This doesn't mean don't ask. This doesn't mean don't plead for the opportunity to enter the process after the deadline. But do realize that they may say no. 

You will need to contact the university/college to see what their policy is. They might limit credit to only unpaid internships. They might require information from the employer in addition to your report, therefor both sides could realize that there is pay or credit involved. The recent court decisions in the US have limited the number of unpaid internships unless they can show that the person gets a benefit worth more than the company gets in free labor. Of course budget cuts and the poor economy have reduced the number of paid internships. Some companies give you a choice for credit or for pay. They have a different number of slots available in each program. They may also have different numbers of hours available for each program. For credit interns can work as many hours as they need to meet their university requirements. Paid interns can work until the money runs out. Also keep in mind that you probably will end up paying tuition for those credits. You will have to considered that into your equation if you need to decide if you want to go with paid: but no credit; or unpaid but for credit. 

While the largest cities have more opportunities. There are also many opportunities in smaller cities. For instance in the United States you will find that many of the major defense and software companies have offices near military bases. They will have projects tailored to the area of support that base needs. Not all major companies have their largest workforce in the largest cities. Many banking, insurance, and chemical companies are not in the top ten metro areas. They have offices there, but the software work is done elsewhere. Each midsize city may only have one or two companies, but there are still plenty of jobs either in smaller cities or the far suburbs of the largest cities. 

Look around the room at lunch. Are others reading books, listening to their MP3 player, reading a newspaper, reading a non-technical magazine, watching CNN? If they are doing these things, and it is your personal phone/iPad why is it different? You could even be playing "words with friends" or some similar game, with somebody at the table. If you are in the break room, and you haven't exceeded the allowable break time, why should anybody care? Oh some will, but they will be in the minority. 

In addition to all the advice about taking the time to review the offer, and then signing your acceptance, ask the new company for the earliest or most convenient start date. I worked for one company that had a policy that they only started new employees on the first day of the pay period. They had the policy because they were hiring dozens of employees and had a whole day set aside for paperwork, required briefings, and mandatory training. If you new company has a similar policy and you give your two weeks notice the day after you sign the offer, you could end up being unemployed for almost two weeks while waiting for the scheduled start day. There is almost never a need to rush the process. They know that many employees have to put in notice with their old company, and the new company needs time to prepare for a new employee. 

If they think the incident is reportable by you, they will still expect you to report it after it is removed from your record. They said "that has or has not been expunged or removed from your record". So even years from now they will want you to report it. That tells me that they want you to tell them those things that will be hard to find. 

Assume that one of several things will happen. the actual events will depend on your contract, union, and if you work in an at-will location. 

The question can best be answered by a company that has this policy, but I have worked with some organizations that tried, but failed to use it. 

Based on your comment "this is my first week, but does it matter?" it is clear that you are the new member of the team. Therefore you need to ask your boss questions to determine what is the scope of the problem and what should you do. Food allergies can range from inconsequential with no way for a person consuming the food to impact the allergy sufferer; to deadly where somebody consuming or cooking the food near them can cause a problem. We can't guess where they fall in this spectrum. Because this is an issue that has existed for a while, others know what to do. The company and the employee have reached an understanding. It is possible that the employee has not been revealed to other employees, so start with your supervisor. They may give specific guidelines, or direct you to HR, or even to the person with the allergy. Their answer may even depend on how likely you are to interact with the individual. 

Yes you can explore the second opportunity. This is especially true when your current job is in jeopardy. When the first position makes you a formal offer, they will ask you to drop any other internal positions you are looking at, or any positions you are being considered for, when you accept their offer. They do this because they don't want you to accept the offer, then go with the a second internal position that make an offer the next day. There is no guarantee that the offer for the first position will be what you want. In the past I have rejected formal offers for various internal transfers because despite what I was told in the application process and the interview: 

The Grade is fixed in place. The step is very hard to negotiate. If they are filling the position via promotion they will offer the starting step as equal to a double step advance of the lower grade. If you are coming from an Agency with bands vs Grades there may be some wiggle room. Whether they will offer relocation is based on their budget, and how they perceive their ability to find local talent. Some job descriptions have a extra bonus becasue they are considered hard to fill in that location, but that would have been figured into the job description. Vacation is harder to negotiate because they don't want to have too many different starting numbers and earning rates. I have seen a non-zero starting number, or treating all employees at a certain level as if they were there X years so they earn vacation at a higher rate, in the private sector. When the government allows a variation it is becasue they are filling a senior position, or when the employee is coming from another part of the government that would strip earned vacation from their account. Starting date can be negotiated, to allow you to move, finish a project, or take leave prior to starting. Insurance is related to where you work/live. Items such as student loan forgiveness, day care, and maternity leave are determined by the agency. Non-standard work schedules are dependent on your supervisors permission and are not an HR concern. 

They probably won't call references early in the process. They will not call your current employer until they have no choice. So list your current employer in the appropriate employment section. When they do check your employment history many large companies will only provide the fact you worked there from date 1 to date 2, and your job title was X. They might provide the reason why you left, or your pay rate. Some companies even setup a toll-free number to handle the reference checks for employment, and loans. The interviewer won't generally talk to your supervisor, they can't trust that they will get an unbiased answer. You current company doesn't want your supervisor to talk to the interviewer, they don't want to be sued if you don't get the job. Don't start the conversation with your current manager until you have a written offer. While everything may seem great now, you have no idea what will happen when you have basically told him that you could leave at any time. Some companies will counter offer but you don't even want to see it until you have a written offer in hand. 

There is no barrier when moving from small to less small companies. Even with companies with thousands of employees many times they will be on a small team working on a particular project or product. I have worked for companies with over 100,000 employees but the team was less than a dozen. In my current position the company has 20,000 employees with there are only ~20 on the project. While there is a different level of bureaucracy in larger companies, for most employees it is transparent. The advantage of the larger company is that when your project comes to an end there are more projects to pick from. I have never looked at the size of employers listed in the resume as an indication of anything. I could see how in some management positions the size of the company could make a difference, but for most positions open to employees only a few year out of school I don't see how it could ever make a difference. The idea that being an hour away is a problem depends on the regional point of view. In a large metropolitan area it takes more than an hour to go 20 miles, in a rural area the hour drive can cover more than 60 miles. In my city an hour commute is considered no big deal. They will ask about the commute during the interview, and you should ask about core hours, alternate work schedules and telecommuting; but I would never eliminate somebody pre-interview based on perceived commuting distance.
