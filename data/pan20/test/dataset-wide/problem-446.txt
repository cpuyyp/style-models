Why Fighters? When anybody thinks "space fighter," they are analogizing to fighter aircraft. After all, space is kind of like the air, just higher. And even the Air Force handles the military's space stuff! This must mean space fighters make sense, right? Wrong Let's look at a couple of existing types of warfare: 

Speed: In space, you move fast--really fast, literally faster than a speeding bullet. However, space is bigger than you are fast, which would make races seem slow. An interplanetary 'racetrack' would take months or years per lap. Even the smallest possible 'racetrack,' low Earth orbit, takes around 90 minutes per lap. This brings me to the next point: Skill: We like to make racing about the skill of the pilot, not an engineering challenge. Formula 1 places ever-stricter limits on 'driver aids' every year and NASCAR basically specs out the entire car for you. However, maneuvering in space is very difficult without computer assistance. Either the pilots would be passengers simply operating the computer, or they would have to be maths professors. Even so, their speed around an 'orbital racetrack' is determined purely by the physics of the situation: achieving minimum time is basically an optimization exercise for the trajectory designers, and everybody would probably come up with the same plan. Money: Space is expensive. Even NASA's low-cost, high-risk missions (the Discovery program, or class D missions) cost hundreds of millions of dollars, more than any F1 team spends in an entire season. Plus a space race would not be all that exciting (to the average viewer): long periods of nothing punctuated by short periods of computer-controlled burns. By the way, this is all impossible to film without the networks developing their own rockets, at similar cost. Not only would nobody want to compete, nobody would be willing to cough up the money to host. 

This is so cool, I think this is going to be the setting for my next story, even though it's impossible. 

So I've decided to write my next story with a model that allows the past to be changed. One-person Model The model I have in mind is based on a "rewind" mechanic. This has been used successfully before: see, for example, Next1 or Life is Strange. In this model, the main character has the ability to rewind time, usually by a limited amount. This power manifests itself to the outside world as precognition. My internal model of how this works is something like a git repo. 

NO Let's reverse the scenario for a second, and talk about reflections from the Earth onto the Moon. The Earth is not 100% water, and is partially covered by clouds, but since it's a lot bigger than your watery planet the visible water area is similar on average. Plus, the Moon makes a much better "canvas" for any possible reflections since its surface is far more uniform than the Earth's. Can we see any reflections on the Moon? 

By "non-relativistic" I assume you mean Galilean relativity. That is, a universe with no weird high-speed effects, where changing reference frames is as simple as adding velocities and there is only one universal time. The reason Galilean relativity was the prevailing theory at one time was that it is an extremely close approximation to reality at the low speeds we deal with. In order to make it exactly true, then all speeds must be small compared to the speed of light. In other words, the speed of light is infinite. Just take all our physical laws, and take the limit as $c$ goes to infinity. Then the factor $\beta=v/c$ is always zero, and the factor $\gamma=1/\sqrt{1-\beta^2}$ is always 1. This means there is no time dilation or length contraction. This universe is logically consistent, but due to the infinite speed of light there would be no electromagnetic radiation as we know it. I'm not sure what implications this has, but you can probably handwave those problems away. Details (Update) Maxwell's equations implicitly involve the speed of light (they must, since they are what govern electromagnetic radiation i.e. light). The key one to consider is Ampere's law: $$ \nabla\times\mathbf{B}=\mu_0\epsilon_0\frac{\partial\mathbf{E}}{\partial t} $$ It so happens that the product of the constants in that equation is related to the speed of light: $$ \nabla\times\mathbf{B}=\frac{1}{c^2}\frac{\partial\mathbf{E}}{\partial t} $$ This means that if $c$ is infinite, this equation becomes: $$ \nabla\times\mathbf{B}=0 $$ That is to say, instead of electrodynamics we have magnetostatics, under which conditions no waves exist. Another way to think of this is with the relationship between frequency and wavelength: $$ \lambda f=c $$ If $c$ is infinite, this equation can only be satisfied is if the frequency or wavelength (or both) are infinite. Since infinite frequency makes no physical sense, we must conclude that all waves are infinitely long: that is, that there are no waves at all. 

One final point: I mentioned time zones in the previous section, and for a large country like Canada time zones are pretty much a necessity (although China seems to be OK without them). There are two options: 

We can see that from a mechanical standpoint a spaceship can be almost unimaginably huge, comparable to the size of the Moon (although much less dense). The gravity inside the spacecraft increases proportionally to the distance from the center, reaching a maximum at the surface of: $$ g=\frac{GM}{R^2}=\sqrt{\frac{8\pi G\sigma}{3}} $$ For our test spacecraft the surface gravities are on $0.013~g$, $0.008~g$, and $0.018~g$, so you'll still be pretty much floating on the inside. I Feel the Need... the Need for Speed! The second limitation is power. If a moon-size spacecraft is insulated well enough that its surface is a frosty $-200~^\circ C$, then the power requirement to maintain the internal temperature due to heat loss is about $60~\text{TW}$, or about four times global energy consumption. However, this pales in comparison to the energy needed to move around the solar system. Moving a tenth-moon-mass spacecraft from Earth orbit to Mars orbit will require at least $2\times 10^{30}~\text{J}$ of energy (the Sun's entire energy output for two hours). Even assuming $99\%$ efficiency, that the energy is slowly applied over a year, and radiators cover the entire surface of the spacecraft, you'd need to maintain a temperature of $4200~\text{K}$ to reject the waste heat. Doing the math (again, too complicated to waste space here) we find that the maximum size for a spacecraft radiating at a given temperature and power is: $$ M=\frac{36\pi\sigma^3 T^{12}}{D^3\rho^2}\\ R=\frac{3\sigma T^4}{D\rho} $$ Where $\sigma$ is now the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, not stress, and $D$ is the waste power generated per unit mass. In our case (a year-long trip to Mars using a $99\%$-efficient reactionless drive) $D\approx 0.1~\text{W}/\text{kg}$ and $\rho\approx 200~\text{kg}/\text{m}^3$. Assuming we maintain a comfortable exterior temperature of $300~\text{K}$, this gives us: $$ M=270\,000~\text{t} \\ R=70~\text{m}=230~\text{ft} $$ This is actually a minimum estimate of the maximum size, since a sphere is the least-efficiently radiating shape. You can get much larger by extending radiative surfaces out from your craft. As a rule of thumb, at the energy density mentioned above you need one square meter of radiator for every five tonnes of spacecraft, or one square foot for every half-ton. (Remember if you have "wings" that radiate on both sides the area is doubled!) So while a spacecraft could structurally be the size of a small moon, the energy requirements would make it impossible to manage. You should be much safer with a ship in the million- to billion-tonne range, with a size from a few hundred meters to a few kilometers: think battlestar size. 

1 Thanks to Frostfyre's mention of the cryptex for inspiring this answer. 2 The warhead of an RPG is also a shaped charge: however, Arena's shaped charge disrupts the normal firing of the RPG so that its copper jet is formed incorrectly and looses effectiveness. 

Simply unleash the entire world's nuclear arsenal on the planet. If you aim for population centers, the majority of the population would be vaporized or killed by acute radiation poisoning. This has the added (dis)advantage of destroying or irradiating most of the useful technology (factories etc.) making it difficult for humans to rebuild. The fallout would probably cause global radioactive rain, bad for any remaining survivors. Finally, the resulting nuclear winter would devistate the ecoystem. Without the abundance of plant and animal life we are used to, humans would find it difficult to survive in the decades or centuries it takes the earth to recover. 

Basically, space navigation is too far outside the human scale of experience to be good competition for humans. Instead I would suggest zero-g or low-g sports for humans to play in space. 

Infinite Energy Cheat This spell doesn't just break thermodynamics, it explodes it into a million pieces. Magically heating an area obviously violates conservation of energy. This is OK, but you should be aware that it will have... side effects. The Newcomen steam engine was in use by 1712. It was one of the first heat engines, which generates useful energy by transferring heat across a temperature gradient. We can now make a 60 degree temperature gradient, on demand, with no fuel. This should not be too hard for a learned person to put together. 

Ignoring the physical/mechanical issues with the transformation itself (a wizard did it), I see another possibility for the DNA: a mixture between the two. Point one: The genomes of different species are mostly identical. See some numbers with sources here. I'd estimate that a human and werewolf dog share between 80 and 90% of the their genome, so it wouldn't be too much of a stretch for an individual to have all of the genes necessary for two species. Point two: Only a small fraction of our genome contains actual coding sequences, most of it is "junk." Even out of our genes themselves, not all of them are "active" at any one time. The relatively new study of epigenetics studys what causes genes to be activated and deactivated, and what influences the 'strength' of their expression. Putting these two together, you might say that the genetic structure of your individual has been modified to contain all the genes from both species, and some epigenetic mechanism 'switches' between the two sets of genes that are specific to one or the other species. 

The Bekenstein bound limits the amount of information that can be contained in a system. It states that: $$ I\leq \frac{2\pi RE}{\hbar c\log 2} $$ Where $I$ is the amount of information (in bits), $R$ is the radius of a sphere enclosing the system, and $E$ is the amount of mass-energy contained in the system. Obviously in order to increase storage density we must increase energy density. However, general relativity places a limit on how much energy we can store in a given volume before forming a black hole: $$ E\leq\frac{Rc^4}{2G} $$ Combining these two, we obtain the following: $$ I\leq\frac{\pi R^2c^3}{\hbar G\log 2}\approx 1.4\cdot10^{69}~\text{bits}\cdot\text{m}^{-2}\times 4\pi R^2 $$ That is, the amount of information contained in a volume is limited by the surface area of that volume. Fortunately for you, this means that your counter can be theoretically compressed into a sphere just $280~\text{nm}$ in diameter! 

According to this phys.org article most proteins have a half-life on the order of days. Without DNA, you lose the ability to replicate proteins, and your cellular structure would literally fall apart. You would notice total DNA loss far before a day had passed, as the shortest-lived proteins degraded, causing failure of critical chemical pathways in your body. My guess is that you would go through the symptoms of acute radiation poisoning and die in just minutes to hours. This is sort of like asking how far your car can go if all its bolts disappear. You will be held together for a little while by friction, but you will die, and fast. Update One of the shortest-lived proteins in the body is ornithine decarboxylase, which forms an important step in removing ammonia from the body. It has a half life of only 20 minutes. In less than an hour, your character would suffer from acute ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency. Ammonia would quickly build up to a level toxic to the brain and kill him (or her). Symptoms include headaches, nausea and vomiting, ataxia and other cognitive impairments, loss of motor function, and seizures. If you experience any of these symptoms... ... don't bother calling your doctor. No known or theorized medical technique can replace a person's entire genome, especially with no reference point as to where DNA needs to be added to the cells. The only solution I can think of is to have some kind of nanomachine swarm deliver fresh DNA to your cells (only the ones you want to keep). Even if you could do this today, if it took more than a half-hour or so it would be too late anyway; but by the point nanotechnology advances that far, reversing the extensive damage to your body should also be possible. 

Although the shots now have distinguishably different trajectories, again they both impact at nearly the same angle (although both are more horizontal than the .50). 

The Short Answer No. Such a device is not plausible at any tech level as it does not obey the laws of physics. -v More specifically, such a device violates conservation of momentum. Although it first appeared as a consequence of Newton's laws, conservation of momentum is extremely fundamental to physics. In fact, it can be shown using Noether's theorem that momentum will always be conserved if the laws of physics don't change from place to place. (Although the universe is perverse, it's not quite that bad.) This means that momentum cannot be magnified or reflected; it can only be concentrated, diluted, or transferred. There are two points to note here: 

You've hit the nail on the head: in general, everyone's clocks will run at different rates, depending on their speed and position relative to gravitational fields. For example, we on Earth experience a different rate of time relative to satellites in orbit. However, just because time is relative doesn't mean that we can't know when a ship will arrive at its destination. We just need everyone to agree on one specific inertial frame that times will be measured in. Once everyone is agreed, you can just convert your own spacetime coordinate system into the reference frame, and then convert into someone else's coordinate system. We already do this in a simplistic fashion with time zones. I can convert 1:45 pm EST (UTC-5) to 6:45 pm UTC, then convert to 2:45 am (+ 1 day) Beijing time (UTC+8). In your case the math will be more complex, since the time rate depends on relative speed, among other factors. The conversion will likely be handled by computer: you'll just ask your helmsman when you'll arrive at Alpha Centauri, and he'll read off his navigation display, "5 weeks, 3 days, 8 hours, and 31 minutes, and it'll be 6:56 on Tuesday the 22nd when we get there." The important thing to remember is that in any coordinate system, every point in spacetime will be mapped one-to-one to a unique set of coordinates. As long as you specify which frame your coordinates are in, there won't be any confusion.
