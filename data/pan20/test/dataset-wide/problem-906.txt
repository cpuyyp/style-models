This is supported by "And all that in them without me were seeds only..." in that seeds, dust, and atoms are small, basic units, similar to motes. You'll note that atom and mote are standard definitions of atomy. This is further supported in that Whitman was famous for using lists in this poem in particular, thus using different words for similar concepts is not only consistent, but almost certainly intended in this passage. However, 

That’s pretty f---ing hardcore, and no accident Homer leads to Euripides, the Iliad to the Trojan Women. Notice in particular there is no mention of Trojans in these opening lines of the Iliad, but only of the Greeks themselves, and their suffering and shame.[F] 

This is a complex subject, and worthy of a thesis, but I'll attempt to briefly address it. The Sarpedon incident is interesting in that Zeus only contemplates altering fate. One could say that his ultimate decision to let Sarpedon die is a confirmation of the inviolability of fate. In the same way, the gods, most notably Poseidon, may argue about Odysseus' fate, but ultimately he does return to Ithaca. You may find this video elucidating: Barry Powell, translator of The Odyssey, explains that fate is in the hands of the Gods and it overrides all circumstances. (Oxford University Press) In Homer's Conception of Fate (James Duffy, The Classical Journal, Vol. 42, No. 8, pp. 477-485) the author asserts: 

The problem with art is subjectivity, and everyone has their favorite authors. Joy derived from a work is legitimate, and notwithstanding of the "elevation" of the work. But a much stronger case for elevated work can be made for authors like Swift, Orwell, Lem and Dick. From my perspective, as a Classical Scholar and Mythologist, all fiction was "genre fiction" before the modern literary fiction movement. This extends from Gilgamesh and Homer through Dumas and Jack London. In many ways, speculative fiction is the most literary of the genres because the origins of speculative fiction, of which Swift is a paragon, is the facilitation of discussion of social issues that would be censured if made directly in context of contemporary society. Thus Lem could use genre to be be subversive, avoiding the censure of overly literal bureaucrats who wouldn't catch the subtext, and this is a tradition which goes back to at least Homer, in that the Iliad was a heavily subversive work. Further, genre opens the discussion of such topics to a wider audience than would normally be interested. (i.e. Hunger Games is probably more widely read, and at a much younger age, than treatises on information warfare and economic inequality.) 

My personal feeling is that what Whitman's was really saying with atomies is "all of the sets of minutiae that comprise the world". Atomy is related to anatomy, and this strengthens the anthropomorphic theme--that of the poet has giving voice to the rain. (See also "What the Thunder Said".) If the rain has a voice, surely the earth itself can be regarded as an organism, or an amalgam of organisms. Leaves is, at times, quite sexual, and this passage is distinctly so. The rain is creating life in a process analogous to procreation: "I descend to lave the drouths, atomies, dust-layers of the globe, And all that in them without me were seeds only, latent, unborn; And forever, by day and night, I give back life to my own origin..." In many ways, this section calls to mind the mating of Gaia and Ouranos (heaven and earth) but transforms the process into something nurturing as opposed to terrifying in that the progeny is sustaining, not destructive. 

The specific Butler passage you reference can be found on Perseus line 272-348. An alternate 1924 translation by A.T. Murray may also be found there. The Murray is quite distinct from the Butler in these passages, which got me wondering about the Greek because 

*The Second Coming was published in 1919, about 15 years before Eliot began working on the first Quartet, Burnt Norton. 

which is an allusion to the bible, consistent with the song title. In this context, it probably reflects the willingness of the pursuer to surrender their power to the object of desire, regardless of consequence. 

"Literature" in this context is used to connote what may be termed the genre of "Literary Fiction" as opposed to mere "Genre Fiction". The distinction is exceptionally useful in the contemporary landscape to distinguish work with deeper merit (i.e. possessing more than mere entertainment value.) 

I was doing a little research on the etymology of John recently. (I suspect that Riordan's "Jackson" is a reference to John, where "Jack" is a form of John, and Percy Jackson is likely meant to be "Perseus Son-of-the-Grace-of-God", which is a reflection both of his parentage and his deliverance as an infant cast out to sea.) The Online Etymological Dictionary states: 

in this case using as iambs to establish the meter, and which brings me back to stressed/unstressed metrical feet. Only problem is, in this context, the delivery is archaic and wildly incorrect. 

NOTE: I do seem to recall there is a specific "old-timey" term for this, but it's escaping me at the moment. 

Specifically, bones are often hidden in the "dust-layers of the globe". Whitman was a contemporary of Charles Darwin, and the paleontology was an exciting, rapidly developing area in science. [Note: The first edition of Leaves of Grass was published a few years before On the Origin of Species, but Voice of the Rain seems not to have appeared until the 1891 edition of Leaves.] 

Snack foods tend to be highly emphasized in McDonagh's plays, touched on in this article: "The Lord-Lieutenant’s Biscuit and the Irishman’s Spud: Ireland’s Iconic Snacks Blasphemed in Martin McDonagh’s Leenane Trilogy" By Christopher Morrison. But McDonagh's use of snacks in a dramatic context is not restricted to the Leenane Trilogy--they are something of an obsession in The Cripple of Inishmaan, and they are often a point of passionate, sometimes violent, contention. The linked article goes into great detail on the historical and sociopolitical implications of McDonagh's use of snacks, but that type of thematic foundation alone is not sufficient to carry a dramatic work. McDonagh's plays are celebrated and highly popular outside of Ireland, so there must also be a more immediate, relatable, and universal purpose for the device. 

Translated by Frank Justus Miller as: "Then, when he alighted near the maiden, he said: "Oh! those are not the chains you deserve to wear, but rather those that link fond lovers together." We even have an aquatic monster to be slain by Perseus, and Ovid specifically references Apollo slaying the dragon Python in these passages. Like Cupid, Apollo is famed for his archery, and is also associated with the fire of divine inspiration. Love is commonly understood as a fire kindled in the heart, a different kind of divine inspiration. *(The choice of viper, a much smaller serpent, may be a secondary reference to Cupid's "poisoned" arrows—arrows may be said to "have wings" in that they fly.)
