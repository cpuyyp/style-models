Let $M$ be a smooth $n$-manifold. A projective structure on $M$ is a class $p$ of torsion-free connections on $TM$ which have the same geodesics as unparametrized curves. The bundle of densities of projective weight $w$ is the density bundle $\mathcal{E}(w) \to M$ associated to the (tangent) frame bundle of $TM \to M$ for the representation $g \mapsto |\det(g)|^{\frac{w}{n+1}}$ of $GL(n, \mathbb{R})$ on $\mathbb{R}$. Now the standard projective cotractor bundle is defined to be the jet bundle $$\mathcal{T}^* := J^1 \mathcal{E}(1) \to M.$$ Now from the point of view of Cartan geometry and Klein geometry, the usual flat model for $n$-dimensional projective geometry is the projective sphere (the double cover of projective space) expressed as a homogeneous space $SL(n+1, \mathbb{R})/P$, where $P$ is the stabilizer of the ray through the first standard basis vector in $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$. In the Cartan geometric picture of projective geometry, the standard projective cotractor bundle is the associated bundle to the Cartan principal $P$-bundle for the contragradient representation $g \mapsto (g^{-1})^*$ of $P$ on ${\mathbb{R}^{n+1}}^*$. Thus, for the projective cotractor bundle $\mathcal{T}^* = J^1\mathcal{E}(1)$ we should be able to write down a Cech cocycle of transition functions with values in $P$. Is there any obvious way to see how to do this? 

Consider a pair of principal bundles $P \to M$ and $P' \to M'$ with groups $G$ and $G'$, respectively. A morphism from $P$ to $P'$ is a pair $(\Phi, \phi)$ where $\phi: G \to G'$ is a Lie group homomorphism and $\Phi: P \to P'$ is a fibre bundle map which is equivariant with respect to $\phi$ in the sense that $\Phi(u.g)= \Phi(u).\phi(g)$. This gives us a category $\mathsf{Prin}$ of principal bundles and their homomorphisms. If we require that $G = G'$ and $\phi= \mathrm{id}_G$ then we get the subcategory $\mathrm{Prin}G$ of $G$-principal bundles. Now, we know that the construction of associated bundles is a bifunctor $\mathsf{Prin} G \times G\mathsf{Man} \to \mathsf{Bund}$, where $G\mathsf{Man}$ is the category of manifolds with left $G$-action and $\mathsf{Bund}$ is the category of fibre bundles. Now, suppose that we pick a morphism of principal bundles $(\Phi, \phi)$ as above, where $G$ and $G'$ might differ. Then what is the relationship between the corresponding associated bundle functors? Do we get a natural transformation between the functors, for example $P' \times_{G'} (-) \Rightarrow P \times_{G}\phi^*(-)$, where $\phi^*: G'\mathsf{Man} \to G\mathsf{Man}$ is the restriction functor? If so, under what conditions would this be a natural isomorphism? For a concrete example, suppose $(\Phi, \phi)$ is a morphism from a $\mathrm{Spin} (n)$ principal bundle $P$ to an $\mathrm{SO}(n)$-principal bundle $P'$, where $\phi: \mathrm{Spin}(n) \twoheadrightarrow \mathrm{SO}(n)$ is the universal covering space. Typically, $P'$ will often be the orthonormal frame bundle of an oriented semi-Riemannian manifold. My go-to reference for these sort of things is Natural Operations in Differential Geometry by Kolar, Michor, and Slovak, but I couldn't find an answer there. I have this question tagged as spin geometry because I figure people working in this field have thought about this sort of question before. 

The answer in the second case is even easier. In order to avoid circularity, define the Stieltjes transform of a measure only on the complex plane minus the real axis . Then the measure has support in a compact interval if and only if this transform has an analytic continuous over the real axis outside of this interval. This has suitable generalisations to bounded measures (i.e., with not necessarily compact support) and even to distributions where it is a kingpin of the theory of distributions as boundary values of analytic functions (Köthe, Tillmann et. al). 

The result you mention uses the algebraic structure of euclidean space since it involves a form of uniform approxability of the set and its translates. However, there are many criteria for compactness which dispense with this, e.g., one which involves approximability by conditional expectations rather than translates (see, e.g., p. 295 in Bogachev, Measure Theory, vol. I) and so do not require an algebraic structure on the underlying measure space. There is, in fact, a considerable literature on compactness in $L^p$-spaces which goes back to the 30's. You might want to have a look at a recent article by Krotov in Sb. Math. 203:7 (2010) 129-148 which gives a brief historical summary in the introduction. 

This is really a comment, not an answer but I am not empowered. I am taking the liberty of reinterpreting your question (always a dangerous course) since it has already been pointed out that your operator is not compact. I think that the proper framework for your question is that of $L^2$ on a space which has symmetries induced by a group action, say transation on the real line and the rotations of the sphere, both of which are hinted at in your query. Here, although the operators you allude to are not compact, one does get an orthonormal system of eigenvectors, provided that the group is compact, as is the case of the rotation group, but not the translation one. The corresponding eigenvectors for the sphere are the spherical functions which have played a central role in mathematical physics since their introduction by Thomson (aka Lord Kelvin) and Tait. The non-compactness in the second case leads to the fact that the "eigenvectors" do not lie in the Hilbert space (but in that of the tempered distributions). There is a considerable literature on this subject at various levels of sophistication (mathematical or physical). 

At least for the case of the terminal map $t: X \to 1$ from a locally connected space $X$, this is true (as pointed out by მამუკა ჯიბლაძე in the comments, the locally connected assumption is necessary). The inverse image $t^{-1}$ constructs constant sheaves on $X$ out of abelian groups, and since $t^{-1}$ is exact, we can apply the adjoint functor theorem if we can merely verify that it preserves infinite products, which it obviously does. I am not sure if this left adjoint agrees with the pushforward with proper supports $t_!$ in the case where $X$ is locally compact, but I would hope it does. More generally, I would like to know: 

In Bredon's Sheaf Theory text, he defines a category of all sheaves on all spaces, whose arrows, called cohomomorphisms, are pairs $(\psi, f): \mathscr{F} \to \mathscr{E}$, where $\mathscr{E} \in \mathsf{Sh}(X)$, $\mathscr{F} \in \mathsf{Sh}(Y)$, $f: X \to Y$ is a continuous map, and $\psi: \mathscr{F} \to f_*\mathscr{E}$ is a sheaf homomorphism. These compose in the obvious way. I don't see comorphisms mentioned very often in sheaf theory texts, though they are used as the arrows in the category of ringed spaces. However, we could just as well have defined our arrows to be pairs $(\theta, f): \mathscr{E} \to \mathscr{F}$ where $f: X \to Y$ is a continuous map, and $\theta: \mathscr{E} \to f^* \mathscr{F}$ is a sheaf homomorphism. This choice corresponds to the usual topological or differential-geometric definition of a bundle map, since a vector bundle map $E \to f^*F$ covering the identity on $X$ corresponds to a unique vector bundle map $E \to F$ covering $f:X \to Y$. The only disadvantage of this definition I can obviously see compared to the previous one is that $f^*$ is a left-adjoint, and rarely a right adjoint. 

The isomorphism between de Rham cohomology and singular cohomology is in a sense just basic homological algebra if you take Iversen's point of view that ordinary cohomology of "reasonable" spaces (spaces homotopic to CW complexes) should be sheaf cohomology. By basic homological algebra, it follows that cohomology can be computed using any acyclic resolution. The assumption that smooth manifolds are paracompact means that smooth partitions of unity exist, and hence the sheaf of smooth functions $\mathcal{O}_M$ is fine, and hence sheaves of $\mathcal{O}_M$-modules (such has vector bundles) are acyclic. The Poincare lemma is precisely the statement that the de Rham complex is a resolution of the constant sheaf $\mathbb{R}$ on $M$. So the existence of an isomorphism is really obvious. The interesting content of de Rham's theorem, for me, isn't the existence of an isomorphism itself, but rather that there is a chain map from k-forms (as opposed to de Rham cohomology classes) to singular cochains given by integration of k-forms over singular k-chains. The proof that this is a chain map is precisely Stoke's theorem for integration over singular chains. 

The proper framework for your question is the so-called strict topology on the space of bounded continuous functions which was introduced for the case of a locally compact space by R.C. Buck in the 50's and extended to the case of a completely regular space by several authors around 1970. It has the property that the dual is the space of tight Radon measures. In your case (locally compact and metric, and so paracompact), there are very strong results available, particularly in the direction that you are interested in---characterisations of compactness and convergence for families of measures. A central result concerns the relationship between weak compactness and uniform tightness of such families. You might start by consulting the article "The strict topology and compactness in the space of measures" by John B. Conway which appeared in the Transactions 126 (1967) 474-486. You could also look up the topic of Prohorov's theorem which is relevant to your query. 

There are certainly many other solutions. Here is a recipe for constructing them. If $S$ is a set (say infinite to simplify the presentation). We split $S$ into a disjoint union of $k$-element subsets $S_\alpha$. On each such subset we consider a cyclic permutation. We then fit them together to a mapping on the whole space. This clearly satisfies your condition. 

Since your questions refers to infinite dimensional spaces and not specifically to Banach spaces, it might interest you that there are positive results for locally convex spaces. These all to a certain extent rely on the fact that in general lcs's, in contrast to Banach spaces, (for example, in Montel spaces or reflexive Banach spaces with the weak topology), one can have large compact sets. The main principle behind the results is that in the presence of compactness one can employ the finite dimensional case by reducing to projective limits of spectra of finite dimensional spaces. One possible reference is the Studia Math. paper of K. Astala "On Peano's theorem in locally convex spaces, 73 (1982), 214-223. 

Not sure if this is relevant to your question but there are two natural and well known ways to get self-dual spaces in the category of locally convex spaces, namely objects of the form $E \times E'$ (the cartesian product of a lcs with its dual---this works for reflexive spaces) and the tensor product $E \otimes E'$ (which works for nice nuclear spaces, say Frechet (can't get the accent right) or $DF$---due to the nuclearity one doesn't have to specify which tensor product is being used). The latter space can be identified with the operator space $L(E)$ with the strong topology in this situation. 

Suppose we have a principal bundle $p: P \to M$ with principal connection form $\omega: TP \to \mathfrak{g}$. Given any arbitrary curve $\gamma: I \to P$ in the total space of the principal bundle, where $I=[0,1]$, we can use the nonabelian fundamental theorem of calculus [R. W. Sharpe Thm 7.14] to integrate $\gamma^*\omega: TI \to \mathfrak{g}$ to a map $g: I \to G$ such that $g(0) = e$ and $g^* \omega_G = \gamma^* \omega$, where $\omega_G: TG \to \mathfrak{g}$ is the usual Maurer-Cartan form on $G$. Now we can define a sort of transport of the starting point $\gamma(0)$ along this curve by \begin{equation}\gamma(0) \mapsto \gamma(t).g(t)^{-1}.\end{equation} Note: I might need to replace $g(t)^{-1}$ by $g(t)$ in the formula above. On the other hand, we can use the standard definition of parallel transport: take the projection $p \circ \gamma: I \to M$, and lift it again to a horizontal curve $\widetilde{\gamma}: I \to P$ with the same starting point $\widetilde{\gamma}(0)=\gamma(0)$. Then we can parallel transport the starting point $\widetilde{\gamma}(0)=\gamma(0)$ by traveling along the horizontal curve: \begin{equation}\mathrm{Pt}_{p \circ \gamma}(t)\gamma(0)= \widetilde{\gamma}(t). \end{equation} Do these two notions of transport agree? In other words, do we have an equality $\widetilde{\gamma}(t) = \gamma(t).g(t)^{-1}?$ For anyone not familiar with the nonabelian FTC, I'll give the global version here: Theorem (nonabelian fundamental theorem of calculus): Suppose we are given a connected manifold $M$ equipped with a $\mathfrak{g}$-valued $1$-form $\omega: TM \to \mathfrak{g}$. Then there exists a smooth map $f: M \to G$ such that $\omega =f^* \omega_G$ if and only if $\omega$ satisfies the Maurer-Cartan equation $d\omega + \frac{1}{2}[w \wedge \omega]=0$ and the monodromy representation $\pi_1(M, x) \to G$ is trivial. Moreover, if these conditions are satisfied then the map $f$, called the integral of $\omega$, is unique up to left translation by an element of $G$. Corollary: On the interval $I=[0,1]$ any 1-form $\omega: TI \to \mathfrak{g}$ has an integral $f: I \to G$ unique up to choice of $f(0) \in G$. 

I've read through the classic Chern-Simons paper where they introduce the Chern-Simons forms. These are differential forms whose exterior derivative gives you the characteristic forms for any given choice of invariant polynomial, and the construction of Chern-Simons forms is a functor on the category of principal bundles with connection. So somehow this construction has to do with differential cohomology and differential characters. Admittedly, I only have a very vague understanding of differential characters and differential cohomology. I have skimmed through the Cheeger-Simons paper but the big idea hasn't popped out at me yet. Also, I am interested in invariants of principal bundles with connection, but from the nlab page on the topic it seems that differential cohomology has to do with circle bundles with connection. Is this indeed the case? Or is it useful for principal bundles with other sorts of structure groups? Essentially, I'm hoping to see the big-picture before I invest myself in learning differential cohomology and differential characters.
