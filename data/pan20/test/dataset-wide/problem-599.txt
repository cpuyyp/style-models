No. Can not, must not. Fluid type mismatches in either direction can make seals and other non-metal parts degrade, swell, and/or fail. Mineral oil, being the less caustic and reactive one, will generally do it more gradually when this mistake does get made, but it still does it or at least can. 

For many years, all brake levers had a cable pull for either traditional sidepull/canti/u-brake brakes or linear pull/mechanical disc brakes. There were small differences between levers but essentially every lever across all bike genres in one camp would work with every brake in that camp. When Shimano came out with their under-tape shift housing routing STIs, they changed their brake lever pull to a higher number, putting it pretty much in between the two existing classes. These levers and brakes are designated Super SLR and they include most of the current Shimano brakes. It's more cable pull. What that means is if you pair Super SLR levers with conventional sidepull brakes, you'll have more rapid arm movement and nice crisp brake feel but less leverage and less power. If you pair Super SLR brakes with conventional levers you'll have the opposite: more leverage but mushy feel and less arm movement, forcing you to have the starting position of the pads very close to the rim if you're going to avoid running out of lever travel. I don't really recommend doing either. The danger of the former is inadequate braking power, and of the latter it's that it can be easy to run out of lever travel, which is also a safety issue, plus the lever feel is poor. 

Short answer is no. In terms of normal bulk housing, it used to be that 5mm shift housings were more associated with mountain/utility and 4mm were more associated with road. Now 4mm has become more the norm for everything, although it's kind of a matter of perspective because there are a lot of bikes still running around with 5mm, and you can still buy 5mm. Either works on both, and the common ferrules both have the same OD (there are weirdo ferrules for weirdo frames that need smaller and larger ones, but that's a tangent). As you've seen, there are various cable kits labeled as mountain or road, and groupset-specific in Shimano's case. There's a couple things going on here. The dimensions of the parts haven't changed - all the mainstream component groups can accept normal housings and ferrules without any adornment. But, the component makers and Shimano in particular seem to have developed certain really specific ideas about what combinations of nosed ferrules and sealing doodads are supposed to go along with which component group, and that's what their group-specific or road versus mountain distinctions are about. Jagwire and other cable set makers have kind of done the same thing. It's all pretty arbitrary in my opinion, but it's a debatable point. The exception is that Shimano is now pushing their slick coated cables very hard for road, and I think that's as it should because their under-the-tape shift routing STIs can have a lot of issues with excess friction being generated at the bar (and that's more or less the reason for the push.) Also, as was mentioned in the comments, there's some notion that the pre-cut housing lengths in packaged cable sets correspond to road or mountain. Honestly this in my opinion is the biggest reason not to even pay attention to the kits that come with pre-cut housings; the world we're living in now is that bikes have all sorts of different housing/cable routing schemes even within their genres, and you need to just cut it to length and make it right. 

They do a good job but you might notice it's pretty much the same thing as the outer part of a crank extractor plus some flutes to clear material and a reference guide, and the nature of various square taper cranks is that there's no guarantee that the extraction threads were precisely aligned enough in the first place that you'll ever be able to necessarily use the guide. (I've at least used them in situations where the guide was a no-go but it was fine in the end.) Where I'm going here is that while there are no guarantees you won't destroy you cranks this way, if the damage is moderate or better then it's pretty reasonable to use your extractor outer bit as an impromptu thread chaser. What I would do is use a 90 degree scriber you don't have reservations about bearing down on to get into the threads and try to "clear a path" for it, doing some preliminary shoving around of errant or damaged material. Then use either cutting fluid or heavy oil to lube up the threads, guide in the tool as much as you can by hand, and then put a wrench on it and very gradually advance it. The leverage of the wrench will let you feel what's happening, i.e. whether it's totally stuck or able to make some progress. If you have some luck and it advances, do a little bit and then go back out all the way so you can clear any material, then go back in, repeating until you can work it back and fourth with no friction. 

They don't pull apart; the idea is that you're getting the couple mm of adjustment range you actually need, and the upside is it's an attempt at the easiest possible design to adjust on the fly while riding. If there's something physically blocking the hole for the cable, you could presumably clear it by poking a pin or needle through. Make sure the cable isn't actually getting stuck at the end of the housing though, either by the ferrule or by the end not being prepped properly. 

7x9 is the size that tends to be used when they're trying to make it compatible with "any" seatpost. Normal metal rails are 7mm, so making it a 9mm oval/rounded rectangle fits in in most cases. It's kind of a hack solution that's become normalized. If you look you could find seatposts where a 7x9 will give either iffy thread engagement or interference/awkwardness with the clamp, although neither are common issues by any means. And of course posts exist that clamp the sides of the rails, and you need to avoid those. What you do want to look for is a post that's got nice abundant contact area with the rails and isn't going to press on them with any sharp edges. You can find posts that are counterexamples of this, mostly older basic ones, and thats what you want to avoid. 

No. The BB90 design puts the bearings the same distance apart that a normal external Shimano BB would, hence a normal Hollowtech 2 road crank being able to run on it. It may be possible to make a BB386EVO adapter for BB90, but if so I don't think anyone's done it. 

It depends on what you mean by big, which can now be interpreted many ways. Without doing anything too tricky, you can run them with any 9-speed Shimano mountain derailer, some of which can natively handle up to a 36t, RD-M592 being a currently made and easily available example. 10 and 11 speed Shimano mountain rear derailers use different actuation ratios, so they can't go directly on your shifter, but they could be made to work using something like a Jtek adapter or Wolf Tooth Tanpan. If you wanted to run a 40 or 42, you could use a Wolf Tooth Goatlink on an applicable 10-speed RD that you also have a cable pull adapter on. If you want to use a road RD, you can go up to a 40 with a Wolf Tooth Roadlink. It's important to understand that they increase the clearance but not the capacity of your RD, so whether it makes sense depends on what's going on up front. (True no matter what route you choose actually.) 

So, orient it taller (or positive offset, or however you want to say it) side right in front and left in back. 

(Re-worked this answer completely because I forgot at first that M770 hubs have nonstandard axles). First of all, under almost all circumstances, you should leave the integrated cone/axle unit of hubs like this alone, other than maybe the fringe case of making one good one out of two identical bad ones or something weird like that. I'm assuming it's clear that you must find some way of getting the drive side cone permanently re-attached to the axle, because it doesn't mechanically lock in place like a standard axle. Epoxy in the threads, etc. The approach I would take here is try to find witness marks on at least one of the cones or the axle that show you about what the original thread engagement was on at least one piece of it when the drive side cone was originally affixed to the axle. Combine that piece of information with the knowledge that the over-locknut dimension is 135mm and you should be able to make everything fall into place. Alternatively, if Shimano's EV diagrams were 100% to scale, down to the representation of the thread pitch, counting threads on the diagram would get you there pretty closely. I suspect they might be that accurate but I'm not really sure. But to answer the specific question, nothing is getting put out of alignment in terms of the wheel/rim relative to the frame or brakes if you eyeballed it when putting it back together. It just means that one piece has a little more thread engagement and the other has that much less. In extreme situations that could present its own issues in terms of the parts being properly secured and the threads staying in good shape, and hypothetically as a result of the strong, full-thickness part of the axle being in the right spot, but in this situation 1mm probably won't make any difference. 

Hub shells with pressed flanges, as opposed to being one solid piece, can do things like this. In such a case the press fit wasn't tight/solid enough to resist all the considerable forces on the shell, and it gradually came loose. The bearing cups that most hubs have pressed into them can also come loose and cause a similar set of issues to what you describe. Both are rare problems, although it's probably true that most or many pressed flange hubs can self-destruct like this if ridden hard or long enough. If it's not one of the above, then I have no idea, other than maybe something went wrong with the machining and it didn't have proper wall thickness or something. But this would be a very weird failure from a one-piece hub shell. Getting a new wheel is the only reasonable fix. 

Not fixable. (Or more specifically, not for anything like the cost of just replacing it even if it is theoretically fixable, which with broken magnesium/aluminum parts like this is a black hole of a metallurgy/welding/machining/heat-treating/fatigue/etc question.) There are two layers to this question - physical compatibility with the frame and parts and whether the resulting bike will have the geometry, handling, and suspension qualities you want for your application. The nature of suspension forks is that there will probably be some degree of change in the latter area when changing models. Some riders have always chosen to dabble with choosing different travel numbers, using forks to tweak geometry, going with something heavier and more aggressive, etc. That is a big conversation and not what you're asking about, so I'll leave it alone other than to say that unless you want to change the bike pretty radically, you're looking for an all-mountain/enduro fork made for the same wheel size and with a travel number in the same ballpark (140-150). Uncompressed axle to crown dimensions are also something to look at, especially on forks with lockout, but they don't tell the whole story. For the physical part, you're looking at steerer length, steerer type, axle type, wheel size, tire clearance, and brake mounting. Steerer length is measured from the crown race seat (where headset meets fork essentially, looking at an assembled bike) to the end of the steerer. You can get an approximate measurement on the bike by taking the stem off and running a tape measure from the crown race seat up and eyeballing. You tend to need to take the fork and ideally the crown race off to get an exact measurement you can stand by (it's all coming off anyway). Steerers on new forks come very long and are cut to fit the frame they're being installed on for all but the biggest bikes. The headset, spacer stack, and stem being used are also factors in determining fork length. A star nut has to be installed afterward. Both of these operations are easy with the right tools and easy to botch without. If you're looking at used forks that have already been cut, you're basically just seeing if they're your current length or longer, unless you're also dropping spacers. Steerer type is going to be a key point for you here because your fork is straight 1-1/8" and most similar forks from recent years have had a tapered steerer (1-1/8" on top, 1.5" on the bottom). There is not a way of making a tapered fork work in your frame since it takes traditional external cups for 1-1/8. (There are lower conversion cups that let 1-1/8 zero stack frames take tapered forks, but that's not this bike). You need another 26" fork, which are also fairly uncommon these days. I can't tell whether your axle is 15mm or 20mm, but you have to get a fork that matches, unless you happen to have the ability to convert the hub. The brake compatibility part shouldn't be a problem, but you'll probably need an Avid post mount adaptor for your rotor size since most forks are now post mount. Also, your lower radiused brake washers appear to be installed in the wrong order and reversed.
