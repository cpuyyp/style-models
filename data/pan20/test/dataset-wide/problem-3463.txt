It is just a missing parenthesis issue. The expression $$\text{(P-MC/P)= -1/η}$$ should have been written $$\text{((P-MC)/P)= -1/η}$$ 

You should always validate statistically your model, running various model diagnostics. It appears you work with time series (single country?). Here, certainly autocorrelation may be an issue. After all, your series for capital is by construction an autoregressive equation with a forcing factor (investment). Software packages usually warn for signs of multicollinearity. Also, a serious issue could be that of endogeneity of regressors. 

After the exchange with the OP in my other answer, let's work a bit with his approach. We have a discrete random variable $X$ with finite support, $X = \{x_1,...,x_k\}$, and probability mass function (PMF), $\Pr(X=x_i)=p_i, i=1,...,k$ The values in the support of $X$ are also inputs in a real-valued cardinal utility function, $u(x_i) > 0\; \forall i$. We then consider the normalized utility function $$w(X): w(x_i) = \frac {u(x_i)}{\sum_{i=1}^ku(x_i)},\;\;i=1,...,k \tag{1}$$ and we are told that $$w(x_i) = p_i \tag{2}$$ Note that we do not just make the observation that a normalized non-negative discrete function of finite domain, satisfies the properties of a probability mass function in general -we specifically assume that $w(x_i)$ has the functional form of the PMF of the random variable whose values $w(x_i)$ takes as inputs. Since $w(x_i)$ is a measurable function of a random variable, it, too, is a random variable. So we can meaningfully consider things like its expected value. Using the Law of the Unconscious Statistician we have $$E[w(X)] = \sum_{i=1}^kp_iw(x_i) = \sum_{i=1}^kp_i^2 \tag{3}$$ This is a convex function, and if we try to extremize it over the $p_i$'s under the constraint $\sum_{i=1}^kp_i=1$ we easily obtain $$\text{argmin} E[w(X)] = \mathbf p^*: p_1=p_2=...=p_k=1/k \tag {4}$$ and we have obtained a general result: 

Your random variable is $X$ = "Yearly Income per capita measured in dollars". So $X$ is a real-valued function. Its domain is usually left unspecified, while its range is measured in "dollars per person-year", as the OP writes it. The density and the distribution (pdf/cdf) functions of $X$ ,say $f_X,F_X$ have as their domain the range of $X$. So the domain of $f_X,F_X$ is a set that carries the unit of measurement "dollars per person-year". Being strict in dimensional analysis, indeed we could say that the density must then be measured in "person-years per dollar" (irrespective of whether this is meaningful or not). So the expected value that is the integral $\int_0^{\infty} x f_X(x) dx$ keeps having "dollars" as a measurement unit (I just assumed $X$ is non-negative), applying the rule the OP states (the one unit is the reciprocal of the other, and we are left with the third which is again "dollars per person-year"). Moreover the integral that is the cdf $F_x(x) = \int_0^x f_X(s) ds$ has a range that comes out "dimensionless", since probability is a relative measure. (Digression: Note that by definition, the distribution function of a random variable measures the probability of the random variable being smaller or equal than a threshold, $F_X(x): = Prob(X \leq x)$. Additional assumptions are required to "tranlsate" this probability as representing also "income shares", meaning I guess "percentage of population with per capita income below or equal to $x$") Turning to the Quantile function, it is defined as the inverse of the distribution function (generalized inverse to cover all cases, but let's keep it simple). Being the inverse, it uses as its domain the range of $F_X(x)$, so the domain of $Q(p)$ carries "probability" as unit of measurement, while its range is the domain of $F_X$. And the domain of $F_x$ is the range of $X$: the Quantile function has the same range as $X$ and so it is measured in "dollars per person-year" too (i.e. its range caries the "dollars per person-year" unit of measurement). it follows that the derivative of $Q(p)$", $q(p) = dQ(p)/dp$ has the same units of measurement as $Q(p)$, while the integral $\int_0^1 pq(p)dp$ is measured in "dollars per person-year" also. 

The situation implicitly described in the question assumes that the two sub-samples have equal size (which is not necessary for the test to go through). In such a situation, if the ratio $RSS2/RSS1$ equals unity, then the null-hypothesis of homoskedasticity won't indeed be rejected for any significance level up to $0.5$, (to be compared to the conventional levels of $0.1,\; 0.05,\; 0.01$) because the statistic used, under the null hypothesis follows an F-distribution (exactly or asymptotically), and more over, one that has equal degrees of freedom for the numerator and the denominator (due to the equal sub-sample sizes). This also makes intuitive sense: if the obtained estimates for the sub-sample variance are equal, then, in order to reject the null, we should accept that it would be more probable than not, that the rejection will be mistaken. 

This is a constant source of confusion in international macreconomics. There are two ways to define the exchange rate. $$E = \frac {\text {home}}{\text{foreign}}$$ Here, we express "units of home currency per unit of foreign currency" (or basket of foreign currencies). In this definition $$E \uparrow \Rightarrow \text {home currency depreciates}= \text {value} \downarrow$$ so it can be confusing at times, since usually the object of study is a specific "home" currency. The other way is the reciprocal $$S = 1/E = \frac {\text{foreign}}{\text {home}}$$ Here we measure "foreign currency units per unit of home currency", and so $$S \uparrow \Rightarrow \text {home currency appreciates} = \text {value} \uparrow$$ Some argue that this second expression is more "natural" since it expresses the "price" of home currency in terms of foreign currency, i.e. "what is the price of 1 euro ? 1.22 USD", "what is the price of 1 USD? 0.82 euro". But not even the notation is standard (for example, the wikipedia article uses the symbol $S$ to denote the exchange rate that we denoted by $E$). One way to avoid confusion is to write the various relations with subscripts, and use just one symbol for the exchange rate. Using $S$ as this symbol, the subscript $f$ for "foreign" and the subscript $h$ for "home" we have $$S_{h/f} = \frac {\text {home}}{\text{foreign}},\;\; S_{f/h} = \frac {\text{foreign}}{\text {home}}$$ For the specific question, since interest rates are in focus, it appears that the underlying law is the Uncovered Interest Rate Parity (UIRP), where $$1+i_h = (1+i_f)\left(\frac {S_{h/f, t+1}}{S_{h/f,t}}\right)$$ $$\Rightarrow_{\text{approx}}\;\; i_h = i_f + \Delta s_{h/f,t+1}$$ or $$i_h= i_f - \Delta s_{f/h,t+1}$$ where $s$ denotes the natural logarithm, and $\Delta$ is the first-difference operator. By looking at the UIRP, we see that if the home interest rate is higher than the foreign interest rate, $i_h > i_f$, it must be the case that $\Delta s_{h/f,t+1} >0$ to satisfy the relation. $\Delta s_{h/f,t+1} >0$ is expected percentage change in the "home per foreign unit" exchange rate. So we say that the home currency is expected to depreciate... But hey, intuition appears to say otherwise: Assume $i_h$ rises above $i_f$. Then foreign investors have a motive to deposit their funds in the home economy, since the interest is higher. But in order to do so, they increase the demand for the home currency, since they need to convert their funds in home currency units. Assuming constant home money supply, this leads to an increase in the value of home currency compared to other currencies. But it does that now so mathematically it decreases the current exchange rate, $S_{h/f,t}$: $$i_h > i_f \Rightarrow S_{h/f,t} < S_{h/f,t+1} \Rightarrow \Delta s_{h/f,t+1} > 0$$ In other words a higher home interest rate increases the value of the home currency now, creating expectations for home currency depreciation in the future. 

This is math-speak but it says what we wanted to hear (one can also find a short exposition in wikipedia to the degree that it trusts the content). Then, we can form the Lagrangean of the problem $$\Lambda = \int_0^1 c_i^\theta\,\text{d}i +\lambda\left(M - \int_0^1 p_i c_i\,\text{d}i\right)$$ and calculate the first-order condition(s) by , informally speaking, "looking at the integral and seeing a sum", $$\frac{\partial \Lambda}{\partial c_i} = 0 \Rightarrow \theta c_i^{\theta-1} = \lambda p_i, \;\; i \in [0,1] \tag{1}$$ ...a continuum of conditions. For later use we define $$\sigma \equiv 1/(1-\theta), \Rightarrow 1-\theta = 1/\sigma, \;\; \theta = \frac {\sigma-1}{\sigma}$$ The constant $\sigma$ can be shown to be the elasticity of substitution between any two goods. Writing $(1)$ for commodity $j$ and equating through the common lagrange multiplier we arrive at $$c_i = \left(\frac {p_i}{p_j}\right)^{-\sigma}c_j \tag{2}$$ Multiply both sides by $p_i$ and take the integral over the commmodity space with respect to $i$: $$\int_0^1 p_i c_i\,\text{d}i = \int_0^1 p_i^{1-\sigma}p_j^{-\sigma}c_j\,\text{d}i$$ $$\Rightarrow M = p_j^{\sigma}c_j\int_0^1 p_i^{1-\sigma}\,\text{d}i$$ $$\Rightarrow c_j = p_j^{-\sigma} \cdot M \cdot \left(\int_0^1 p_i^{1-\sigma}\,\text{d}i\right)^{-1} \tag{3}$$ which is Marshallian demand for commodity $j$. 

The way to examine such issues is by general mathematical treatment, not arithmetic examples. We have total revenue $$TR = Q(P)\cdot P$$ When will Total Revenue remain constant as price changes? We want $$\frac{\partial TR}{\partial P} =0 \implies \frac{\partial Q(P)}{\partial P}\cdot P + Q(P) =0$$ $$\implies \frac{\partial Q(P)}{\partial P} = -\frac {Q(P)}{P}$$ which is to say that the price elasticity of demand is equal to minus unity. Is it possible for this to hold over the whole range of $P$ and not just momentarily, at a specific value of $P$? This entails to find a solution to a simple differential equation (using generic notation) $$y' + \frac{y}{x} = 0$$ which gives $$Q(P) = \frac {A}{P},\;\;\; A>0$$ So if the demand function is as above, it has unitary price elasticity everywhere. 

It is never a good idea to regress something so complex as GDP on a single variate. There may be myriad confounding factors. I can think of two suggestions here: 1) Lookup Barro's and Sala-i-Martin book on Growth, the empirical part, to get an idea of what kind of factors seem to appear to influence growth (or what kind of factors growth can be decomposed into). They can be used as control variables, in order to check whether in their presence IntProp remains a statistically significant variable, and even if it does, what is the magnitude of its effect (so that one can assess its economic significance also). 2) Consider detrending your variables, either linearly or non-linearly using for example the HP-filter, and regress the cycle components and perform the usual correlation analysis of real business cycle models, in order to see whether IntProp leads or lags the GDP cycle. If it leads, an argument could be made that in the short-run at least IntProp pushes the growth cycle out of its trough.
