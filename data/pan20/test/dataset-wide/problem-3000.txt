This argument is valid on your definition (at least one false premise). And valid on the must definition -- if the premises are true, then the conclusion must be true. 

Maximize the consideration of rationality where ever we encounter it as an ends Set at a value of negative infinity in our system any treatment of a person as a mere means calculate in terms of maxims of actions with relation to 1 rather than merely extrinsically (i.e., positives only occur when we have a maxim motivated in this way -- not just when we have an action that would correspond to this maxim). 

Sartre agrees with Kierkegaard except insofar as he doesn't think there is a power outside the self that gives the self selfhood. Instead, we wholly define our meaning through our actions. At the same time, our definitions are not unconstrained. In Being and Nothingness, a major section treats the idea of the "Gaze" which is the experience of being a self for Others. (Cf. for Hegel, we are a self for the slave as master through the slave's identity-giving relation / for Kierkegaard, we are selves when we rest in God). One consequence of this is that the Other for Sartre is a threat to the self's identity and freedom in a way that it is not for Hegel's all-encompassing social vision or for Kierkegaard's Augustinian self. From my understanding, Christian existentialist psychology / philosophy was often called "personalism." But in both cases, the idea is that you need to find yourself in dialectical relationship to others. 

The recognition notion is inherently Hegelian in its origin. Mostly googling "Isaiah Berlin Hegel recognition" but filtering the results a little bit, I would recommend reviewing the following if you want to see how the idea has worked out in relation to Berlin himself: (1) SEP Entry on Isaiah Berlin (2) Isaiah Berlin: Liberty, Pluarlism, and Liberalism esp. on pages 70-72 (3) Isaiah Berlin and the Politics of Freedom: ‘Two Concepts of Liberty’ 50 ... - the chapter on "Social Selves" should be on topic [if it isn't then something is amiss] The work Axel Honneth also seems to be centrally on a politics of recognition as it relates to Isaiah Berlin.

innate - we are born with adventitious - come to us from outside (as for example our senses). imagined - made by fusing different ideas together 

I take this line of questioning to mean that we don't waste our time disagreeing about minor things that we can simply or empirically resolve. Conversely, Socrates and Euthyphro accept that we can wind up with 

I think there are several contributing reasons (as someone who has both published and taught both canonical Western philosophy and Chinese philosophy). 

Both positions strike me as extreme. For the disagree on everything version, it's not historically plausible. In part this is because people in strongly similar cultures in roughly the same era are looking at the same questions. To put that another way, tribesman in the Amazon aren't considering whether or not it matters that someone takes a knee before a football game, but Americans apparently are. Or a more salient matter, is God an assumed feature of the discourse or something else? Kierkegaard and Hegel share a lot of these background assumptions. Stewart to get to the they secretly agree on lots basically has to take passages where Kierkegaard says "Hegel is wrong" (paraphrasing here) and say that Kierkegaard isn't writing that about Hegel -- even when it's defensible as a valid reading of a Hegel passage that Kierkegaard is known to have owned. To add my two cents on some relevant issues where they agreed, 

(though my memory seems to indicate there's a problem with colors as forms for Plato but we'll ignore that). 

The person who claimed to place an absolute value will fold on that position and convert to a quantitative claim about the goodness of saving dolphins 

I would not be surprised if someone had a much better account than this. I'm just trying to get the ball rolling. 

It greatly depends on the sort of 'I' you are trying to prove exists. Descartes is specifically trying to prove a res mensa (thinking thing) exists rather a res extensa. That there are things would prove only the latter. That some thing engages in thinking would prove the former. (You can make an argument from the notion of I -- this is what Hegel does much later, but this is not what Descartes says he is doing) 

tl;dr - in Kant's view we don't have direct access to things in our world. Instead, we experience representations (whitish thing appearing in front of me) and objects (macbook air) based on categories and forms of sensibility that come from us. Basic pattern = object -> representation -> thing. Object is something we can really think about. Representation is something we see/sense. Thing is something we don't encounter. (Again, his technical terms). Representation = the German word Vorstellung. In Kant's case, this is something we can sense and that we experience as within space and time (we bring space and time to the thing for Kant's view). Thing = the German word Ding. In Kant's case, this is often going to be "thing-in-itself." It's not something we encounter or can experience. Instead, we experience representations of it and think about it when rendered as an object. It's a distant cousin to "prime matter." For Kant, a priori (non-experience-based) is the prize, because then we can have certainty. If we have to depend on encountering them, then he sees that as a problem (not explained in this passage). 

But actually at Med 2, Descartes has bracketed out the experience of pain (it won't be back until around Meditation 5). 

The hard part is that 4 does not always follow even when 1-3 are in place. The place where this runs into your argument is that you know the drugs are harmful. Thus, the corresponding practical syllogism is that you shouldn't do them. Therefore, on the classical picture, you have a problem of will and are not acting autonomously. On a modern picture, you might still be able to plead that this autonomous because the orientation to the good that the classical philosophers assumed need not be a part of the picture. (in other words, in the above argument, I have assumed "harm" is an objective reason not to choose something, because objective harm is against the good. Without this belief, no practical syllogism arises about how to relate to the harm -- leaving it open). Let's rearrange all of that back to your question about the government. First, we have to assume your awareness is knowledge that is sufficient (or complete) with respect to the choice. Second, we have to assume that this choice is not arising from weakness of the will but is itself well-reasoned or at least within the realm of rational choice. Given these two assumptions, the government prohibiting you from doing it would be undermining your autonomy. In all practical situations, the government is denying that you are acting rationally and autonomy either because your will is compromised or because your awareness of the harm is insufficient. Thus, the government does not think it is denying your autonomy -- but rather acting on behalf of someone who doesn't meet either the knowledge or choice criterion for autonomy
