In the Bundesliga the highest goal difference without the title goes to Bayern Munich as well. They scored a goal difference of +55 goals in the Bundesliga season 2011/12 beating the old record of +51 goals held by themselves and Hamburger SV. 

The International Business Times said that 4 years ago. Since there is no further citation it's safe to assume that they are responsible for this. Of course it's nonsense. Speed Skating has a long tradition in the Netherlands and is the 2nd most popular sport there (after football) or number 7 in terms of active members (2015). Also skating on the river in Amsterdam was possible the last time in 2012, so traveling on that one would make the dutch athletes good swimmers rather than skaters. 

Blisters on your feet can be caused by several reasons, but mostly they are caused by wearing the wrong shoe size or not wearing them in properly. When buying new shoes they must not be too tight. They should fit well already in the store. Also if they're too big and your foot is slipping in them that's almost guaranteed a blister. And before actually playing with them it is necessary to wear them in. It also helps to wear thicker socks to avoid blisters and with some materials it is easier to wear them in when they're wet (wet leather is softer and the shoe will fit easier). 

Offside signals may be different from the usual indirect free kick signals. Our referees are indicating offside by raising the arm (for indirect fk) and waving the other arm in front of them in a line parallel to the goal line. This plus the linesman's flag signal is sufficient to signal offside offenses. 

There are a few situations covered by the FIBA rules. If it's just a throw-in with no extra info added, then the shot clock will start simultaneously with the game clock as defined in §50.1 (merely because the game clock is restarted under the same conditions): 

Your video pretty much explains how you do it in regular situations and the Laws of the Game provide the same info (link): 

Pretty simple: What statistics? Where do you start and where do you stop calculating? Is someone who scored more goals really the better player or did he have help? You can't compare defenders with strikers using simple math. 

Yes. Like already explained in my other answer, the Hand-Off is not a pass, so yes... a pass may still be thrown as long as the passing rules are met (only one forward pass per play, ball didn't cross the line before, etc). 

I had to watch the replay a couple of times to check who actually gave Sané the ball, so it was probably hard to see for the match officials (the ref stood behind then and both moved towards the ball after the keeper saved it). Since the ball bounced off a defender and was never touched by a team mate there was no illegal offside position. 

With 3 teams: In both cases the winner of the tie will be the one with the most points. If you want to compare more than two team's results for the direct confrontation rule it is necessary to add up all results between the tied teams. It does not work to just compare A with B and B with C and A with C. Yes, they would have won one duel each, but the results count, not the comparisons. You try to do this: 

The most important stats to track are serves, returns, break points and double faults. Depending on how far you want to go you can go into more or less details: Serves: 

Also the officials take safety risks very seriously. Just looking into the barrel gets you disqualified. 

Assuming that your example is correct and the tournament rules don't mention any further details... If those three teams all have the same amount of points and the results are correct we can safely use the "direct confrontation" you've mentioned. In the real world it is usually a small table using only the results between those teams that are tied for points, in this case our three teams. This means 

However, because Field Goal trys have little to no margin for errors the players will do anything they can to succeed. This includes a fair distance from the LoS and always the same distance whenever possible... 

As it stands right now: No. Tickets are sold on the respective Website only and possibly in so-called Ticket Venue Centres sometime during the final sales phase if there are still enough tickets for sale for a certain game (There is no news about the exact time and location yet, but for the Confed Cup there were three: St. Petersburg, Sochi and Moscow). If there are any tickets left from the previous stage (e.g. ordered but not paid for in time) they will be sold in the next stages. Even the last minute sales will be held online. If there are still tickets available after that the FIFA will publish information in time about how to order them (Online or as of then maybe even in Ticket Venue Centres). 

I think the Hoyzer Scandal is of enough significance. The former referee Robert Hoyzer manipulated several matches in the German Cup (DFB-Pokal), 2. Bundesliga and Regionalliga. He was sentenced to serve 2 years and 5 months for match fixing in 6 cases. List of matches he refereed: DFB-Pokal: 

I know of a match I attended myself, which preceded the 4th official. F.C. Hansa Rostock vs. 1. FC Kaiserslautern 3-0 (2.12.1995) Referee Georg Dardenne had an injury in the 52nd minute of the game and was replaced by his assistant Josef Funken. The vacant position then was filled by Helmut Hübner from the audience, who had the referee license for the 3rd division making him eligible to assist in the Bundesliga. In the Bundesliga it is also not that rare to find someone qualified, since there is a special ticket contingent reserved for people with referee license for free. (§ 25.5) 

There is no statement in the rules of (in)eligible pass throwers, so anyone may do so. Also Julian Edelman (Wide Receiver) threw a TD pass in 2015: Ravens vs Patriots 

TL;DR: It's allowed to use other distances, but it would be an unnecessary risk (and a lot of extra training work). That's why they don't do that. 

If the ball went far enough off the original direction it's usually the deflecting player getting the credit for the goal. There's no written rule about how far the ball has to be deflected into another direction, so it's up to the officials to decide. But again, touching the ball alone doesn't make that player the scorer. Deflecting the ball by a few inches doesn't do that either (usually). For example: The kick would land right next to the post and it would be a goal either way.... 

Each discipline has their own scoring system. Since wind has a huge impact on the performance of ski jumpers it has been added as scoring criteria as well as the gate the jumpers start from. This is to compensate for (dis)advantages under different situations. 

So in Baseball it is possible to be considered a rookie in your 2nd season or even later, if injuries or other things prevent you from being on the active roster long enough. 

So (except for health and safety devices) only EPTS devices are allowed in certain competitions and they must have that mark. Anything else is forbidden. 

Note: The time resumes with the catch, because the international Basketball rules or NBA rules say so. 

While Assists are not part of the Laws of the Game there are a few points to be considered, but they may vary in different competitions. According to Wikipedia this is being used for World Cups: 

When you're ready to resume the game, raise your hand to signal the indirect free kick and blow the whistle to let the player take it. Talk. If the players are unsure about what to do, tell them. A good communication is the key to prevent a lot of problems. 

In the NHL the rules are pretty strict, because they take any major professional league into account and not just Ice Hockey. 

So depending on who sweeps (or sweeps more than the other sweeper) you can basically steer the stone by giving it more or less curl... so if you need a lot of curling only one sweeper takes action until the stone is on its designated track, while with two sweepers working equally the stone just goes more straight forward.
