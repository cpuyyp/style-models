Do not over-do cardio. 25x5 is PLENTY. I would actually change it to maybe 4x30 to give your body more days off. The key to integrating a cardio program into a new routine for weight loss is what can you do that will not cause your body to go into starvation mode? When you start a new cardio routine or expense a lot of energy/intensity on cardio your body will naturally try to recoup through diet. No use busting your ass on the treadmill to burn 300 calories and then have to eat 500 calories to feel better. Am I suggesting cutting out the cardio? No. What I am suggesting is cutting down the intensity at first until your body is used to the activity. Also I strongly encourage 2 feet up - 2 feet down jump rope. It is low impact and I don't know of a faster way to take off fat. I am not sure about your weight routine. You label what you do but not how many sets, reps, or exacts. In general what you are saying is good. I would also ask your intensity level, how tired you are after lifting, and how long does the soreness last in each body part. Lifting is more crucial to losing weight than cardio - the more muscle you put on the more your metabolism speeds up. Also your metabolism is sky high during recovery. So lift before your cardio not after. Your diet seems protein deficient. You need to add lean meats/beans. I would aim at 35-40% protein - natural. You should not be taking protein shakes to lose weight. Maybe 1 out of 10 of my clients would actually eat less when taking these sorts of supplements. Only even think about taking protein shakes if you know that you will cut out an equal amount of calories out of your diet. Do not starve your body and you really need to make sure you are limiting binges. You have a big routine. You have to eat. You never mentioned calories and you need to start counting. I would not consider you way overweight. I would shoot for losing a pound every week or two. You need to know more about your calorie intake. Make the goal how you look not your weight. If you are working out hard and lifting you will gain muscle. Muscle is heavy. Often initial muscle gain (some water weight) can rival fat loss. It is conceivable that after a year of lifting/cardio/watching what you eat that you weigh slightly less but look totally different. 

For someone starting out 5-7 mins is just way too long to be sitting around in between sets. You need to be doing something not reading! If you are lifting for pure strength - not size or tone or athletic reasons - than longer break times can work. But not at 5-7 mins per. That means you spent 21 mins doing 15 squats? That doesn't seem efficient. There have been studies done showing that once a person starts an intense workout they have anywhere between 20-35 mins of peak strength building time. After muscles are fatigued (you are making your muscles more tired not necessarily stronger) and the body needs to be replenished. A lot of olympic lifters actually lift twice a day for 30-45 mins each. And yes they do take ridiculous breaks between sets. I don't think you are there yet though. You need to use your time wiser in the gym. Even if you think you have unlimited amount of time your body doesn't. For a beginner 3-4 mins is a long time. Drop the weight, increase the movements you do and the reps, and increase your intensity level. Now once every month or two if you want to have a max out day on a lift you can go ahead and take the long breaks to see where you are at. 

Both types of training are important for maximum running performance. For running-specific advice, you might want to start with the Jack Daniels method. This includes periodization and "training zones," including both longer "tempo" efforts and shorter, faster "interval" efforts. (From Runners' World) 

You can either use HR zones (as you mention) or paces suggested by the Daniels' VDOT tables. The tempo/LT efforts do help with VO2 max training, but traditional VO2-max training corresponds more closely with Daniels' "interval" efforts. Personally, I do tempo efforts (e.g. injecting into a longer run) year-round, but focus on shorter-faster intervals as we approach racing season. I tend to prefer 1k to 2k tempo efforts with shorter rest, or sometimes 4-5k circuit. For intervals, I tend to go to a track and do 400m or 800m repeats w/ a jogging rest. Wikipedia also has a nice summary of the concepts and training effort ranges. 

Obviously it helps if you have a training group or partner to help push you with one of these efforts. You should be able to take the max HR from a workout like this and add a few bpm to get a "true" max. (Let's assume that it's really hard to truly max out in a workout vs. a race.) I'm 37 with a resting HR of ~40 bpm and found my max was probably around 175 bpm. But I've used the various "training zone" percentage ranges and they match up really well with perceived effort. Take your real max HR and subtract your resting HR to get the "heart rate reserve" (HRR): 

Brief answer: Don't give up. Full marathons are complex and tough to get right. Think carefully about hydration and nutrition during the race. I used to run competitively. My marathon PR is 2:32 in Chicago. But I've also run some miserable full marathons. Even shorter races like 10K, I've known I was in much better shape than my race. My best advice about the full is not to give up. It's a long way, and there's a huge difference between a 20-mile training run and 42 km. Each marathon race unfolds in a different way. My first (and fastest) went great. I was cruising along very nicely through about 35 km. I even thought (ha!) that I wouldn't hit the wall. I did, but about 6 km from the finish and got through it. My next one, I was in better shape, but around 18 km, my legs started feeling very heavy and tired. I kept going, but easily 15-20 minutes slower than my target pace. I think my big advice would be to think carefully about nutrition and hydration. These make a huge difference. You need to take carbohydrates during a full marathon. Often this is Gatorade or Powerade. I always test with the actual brand during long runs. My advice is a little bit at each station. If the stations are 1 mile or 2 km apart, you'll be fine. If they're 5 km or more, make sure you get a good drink at each. Gu or gels can work too for some people. I tried once during a long run and within 2 km had to find a bathroom. It just didn't work with my stomach and running. Other friends feel they get a huge boost from the sugars. The short story is that each marathon will happen differently. You'll get a great time eventually with your training. Make sure to also get some rest, both in the training and after long races. It takes ~20 days before you fully recover from a marathon. You may also want to look into periodization training. With 36 weeks, you can get in a training cycle for a 10K or half marathon, then a 16-18 week build for a marathon. 

A lot of body builders I have worked with wear athletic tights and shorts. For deadlifts I prefer people to wear warm-ups. Example would be you basic nike/adidas basketball/soccer style warm-ups. These have a little sheen to them and the bar glides up the leg better. Athletic tights are great too. I can't convince kids to buy/wear these though so I usually don't bring it up. Tradition sweatpants kind of get stuck on your legs when you sweat. I have seen these cause problems "riding up" during deadlifts. For cleans... I prefer shorter shorts and a tight shirt. If the shorts are too baggy/long the bar sometimes catches. It isn't the friction (maybe it is to some) that bugs me but it is the distraction. Warm-ups work well here too. Tight-shirt would be like an underarmor type shirt. The bar should slide up your chest so give it something to slide on. For squats... Loose shorts (tights if you will wear them is fine). Don't want your motion adjusting to your clothing at all. Also you don't want to deal with a split down the middle of your ass. You can wear warmups squatting but they would have to be loose fitting. For bench... tight shirt. Underarmor style would work here. Some people wear bench shirts. I feel a tight shirt promotes rigidity and form. For chin-ups and all the smaller movements... Doesn't matter. 

Your diet is low carb and high in protein/fat. There is nothing wrong with this. However you are depleting the glycogen levels in your muscles. Imagine that you lost a ton of weight and have been working out. You go out for a night of drinking, pasta, and fried food. You wake up the next day and you are like "Damn I look good!" Well that is because you basically pumped up all of the good parts of your body with carbs (simple sugars) while the rest of you probably hasn't changed much in one night. You are pumped up in this situation. Bodybuilders starve themselves and then carb load on day before competition. Now you are doing the exact opposite to your body. I hardly see any carbs in your diet, so your muscles are a bit deflated compared to how they were. Therefore making the fat more noticeable. You are lifting weights. Lifting weights while on a calorie deficit will also result in the lowering of glycogen levels. Your muscles are working hard but aren't getting the calories that they are expending. 

There is a problem with mixing them if you are going above 50-60% max. Your tendons get stretched during cardio. When you lift you want them tight. This can lead to numerous injuries but I would be most concerned about my knees. I am sure someone can give you a lengthy explanation but for the most part leave your cardio to after weights. 

But when asking how to do front levers by lifting it is kind of like asking how to lift to dunk a basketball. You can get marginally better at the front lever by lifting but if you do lever exercises more you will get to it much faster. And at the time I was in peak shape and it took about 2.5 months of practicing it 3 times a week. 

More calories = you gain weight. It doesn't matter if it is butter, milk, and flour or some hamburgers. Actually if you are working out I would go the fast food route since you would get more protein. If you don't like a "healthful" food that is low in calories then don't worry about eating it. Slathering it with calories isn't helping the cause. I would experiment with foods until you found a combo of things you liked that didn't have a ton of calories - hint: low fat meats.
