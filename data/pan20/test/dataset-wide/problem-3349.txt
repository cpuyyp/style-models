I thought the following two passages nicely summarize current thinking on the phoneme in phonology: "The most conspicuously unresolved issue in phonology, in my view, is the debate over the classical phoneme that began in the late 1950s. The critiques by Halle (1959) and Chomsky (1964) deprived the traditional phoneme concept of its theoretical legitimacy, but it has nevertheless survived more or less intact in practical applications (such as speech therapy, reading and literacy training, and speech technology), in linguistic fieldwork, and -revealingly - in beginning linguistics courses. Schane's contention (1971) that generative phonology had only superficially done away with the phoneme has never been refuted (see further Ladd 2006)." Ladd, D. R. 2011. Phonetics in phonology.

(a monumental work on phonology, in 5 volumes, a must-read!) "The concept of the phoneme was central to the development of phonological theory. In the early twentieth century, phonological theory was all about the phoneme: how to deﬁne it, how to recognize it, how to discover it (see, for example, the articles selected for inclusion in Joos 1957 and Makkai 1972). The American structuralist term for phonology, phonemics, indicates to what extent the ﬁeld was considered to be about the phoneme. Things have now changed. The phoneme, to all appearances, no longer holds a central place in phonological theory. Two recent and voluminous handbooks devoted to phonology, edited by Goldsmith (1995) and by de Lacy (2007), have no chapter on the phoneme. It is barely mentioned in the indexes. This does not mean that the phoneme plays no role in modern phonology; closer inspection reveals that the phoneme is far from dead [emphasis mine - Alex B.]. However, it is not much talked about, and when it is, it is more often to dispute its existence than to afﬁrm it. [...] As the above survey shows, the phoneme has not disappeared from phonological theory. The fact that recent handbooks of phonology have no chapters devoted to it is not a sign of its demise; rather, it is a function of the development of phonological theory [emphasis mine - Alex B.]. The time is past when one can attempt to provide an exhaustive deﬁnition of the phoneme and its properties apart from elaborating a complete theory of phonology. Many current topics in phonology can be viewed as being about aspects of the phoneme, even though the phoneme is not invoked." On the phoneme in psycholinguistics: Uppstad and Tønnessen 2010 

Lyons, Christopher. 1999. Definiteness. Cambridge: CUP. Dryer, Matthew S. 2011. Definite Articles. In: Dryer, Matthew S. & Haspelmath, Martin (eds.) The World Atlas of Language Structures Online. Munich: Max Planck Digital Library, chapter 37. Available online at $URL$ Accessed on 2012-03-02. In Dryer's paper, he understands a definite article as "a morpheme which accompanies nouns and which codes definiteness or specificity." 

The inadequacy of purely semantic/notional definitions. Four prerequisites for distinguishing word classes (you need all four of them): 

As you can see from the examples above, the verb “say” in this sense is used transitively, i.e. it takes a direct object. All dictionaries of Modern English mark this dated use as legalese or used humorously. This agrees with data on “said” – the earliest quote in the OED is this one (by the way, note “þe” before “said”): 

As usual in linguistics, a lot depends on your theory of language. Not everyone has gerunds in their theory (actually most modern syntacticians don't). There are some researchers who understand gerunds differently. There are linguists who are agnostic about the inflectional/derivational opposition; others have a continuum with inflection and derivation being at either end etc. There's even the Separation Hypothesis (proposed by Beard) that basically makes the criterion of word class change irrelevant to derivation/inflection etc. - see ten Hacken 2014, who mentions Bloch-Trojnar 2006 split proposal for Irish verbal nouns (four uses are inflectional and two derivational). imho, your example, 'Swimming is a great hobby' (as is), is ambiguous. Now, here's what CGEL actually says - by the way, imho it is one of the most sound grammatical descriptions of English that is still not terribly dated (nomina sunt odiosa) or overloaded with unnecessary, obscure, (intentionally?) ill-defined conceptual apparatus (nomina sunt odiosa again). An ing- form can be: 1. a gerundial noun: She had witnessed the killing of the birds. Such gerundial nouns can take PP complements and crucially they cannot have NP complements (unlike verbs). Gerundial nouns can be modified by adjectives (the wanton killing of the birds), as opposed to verbs, which are usually modified by adverbs (expelled for wantonly killing the birds). Determiners are possible only with nouns (not verbs), note the killing of the birds above. Finally, nouns can be pluralized, e.g. These killings must stop. 2. a participial adjective The show was entertaining. 3. a gerund-participle form of the verb He was expelled for killing the birds. They are entertaining the prime minister. I think most syntacticians would agree with (1) and (2). 

Croft 2003 argues that "the typological universals discovered in contemporary languages should also apply to ancient and reconstructed languages" (the so called uniformitarian hypothesis, p. 233). How so? I don't quite follow his logic. How do new features emerge then? I'd appreciate some references. Update: Let me borrow an example from Burlak and Starostin 2005. Let's say, we have three daughter languages, X, Y, and Z. Some feature F is present in all of those languages but it is realized by different means, F(x), F(y), and F(z). F(x) is the most typologically frequent form (based on "global" typology, not necessarily in this taxon), whereas F(y) and F(z) are less frequent. Now we need to reconstruct that feature for the parent language, W. What should we choose? Synchronic typologists would argue that it should be the most frequent form, F(x) in our case. Now there's the problem. If the parent language W indeed had the most frequent form F(x), then we'd have to argue that language states can change from a more typologically probable state to a less typologically probable one, a very undesirable result.
