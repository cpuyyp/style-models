Most important principle in programming is the SAID principle: Specific Adaptations To Imposed Demands. That means your body will respond to the demands you put on it. Please review this article called "Death By Prowler", in particular the section on energy systems. The big take away is that marathon running and weightlifting require opposing adaptations. As such, your body will do the best it can to compromise with the stresses you are imposing. Best Case: Alternate Emphasis If you have the time to plan out your training, you will give more emphasis to the activity you need most at the time. If you are preparing for a race, the natural emphasis is going to be on your running program. If you are preparing for a lifting competition, the natural emphasis will be on your strength training. 

Any amount of activity will help firm up your body's muscle tone. However, fat is burned in the kitchen. If you are increasing your activity, you will be burning more Calories. However, it may be tempting to overcompensate with your food. You will be hungry after being active, just try to pick healthy things to eat afterwards. 

Not necessarily. In fact, typical anaerobic exercises that use your muscle, such as lifting weights as you mention in your question actually helps to preserve the muscle. It's a signal to your body that you need that muscle. You lose muscle when you don't eat enough protein and other energy sources to rebuild the muscle after training. This is a reason that severe calorie restrictions cause loss of muscle mass. 

Most people who are trying to gain weight have no issue with fat. That's a good thing, because the only thing that will help you gain is to eat a lot of food. To keep the weight on, you need to turn that food into muscle, which requires the right type of work to build that muscle. In short, the quickest way to build muscle is to lift heavy things. Those heavy things can be barbells, dumbbells, kettlebells, you, truck tires, sledge hammers, etc. Check out an Intro to Strength Training I wrote a while back to help you choose what will work best for you. If you are a beginner in the weight room, then I would recommend a simple routine that has the four big barbell compound lifts: squats, bench press, deadlifts, and overhead press. Now, not all conditioning is the same. In order to choose the conditioning that is going to help you keep increasing strength and mass you have to have a better understanding of how the body produces energy to feed the muscles. Since you mentioned martial arts, most sparring matches are limited to 2 minutes of activity followed by a lot of relative rest. That means your conditioning should be tuned to give you continuous output of strength for 2 minutes at a time. Running long distance is a different type of conditioning. The two best resources I've found to help understand conditioning are these: 

To answer the question of what drills undermine vertical leap ability, we need to first discuss what's needed for a good vertical jump. First, there's two types of vertical jumpers: standing and running. A standing vertical jump is when you are stationary on the ground and leap up with all your strength, useful in football and weightlifting. A running vertical jump is when you need to get high while you are running such as volleyball and basketball style vertical. Since you're question is about basketball, you want to focus on the following drills or activities: 

According to your question, I have to take your word that your food and sleep are in order, and you are no longer doing any physical activities. That knocks out the first three major areas. When you go to your doctor, just tell him the symptoms you know, and what you've done about it. They may pry deeper into what you mean by "balanced diet", and ask how restful your sleep is, or whether you have headaches when you wake up. These questions are there to figure out which direction they will have to go with tests to figure out what is going on. It might be that you have an easily treatable disease, or temporary depression. It might be that you have a sleep disorder that is robbing you of quality sleep (I've dealt with that). It might be you've developed asthma (I have family who's dealt with that). 

It's easier to convince yourself to push out a rep when you know it's the last one. At some point you have to tell yourself to shut up and work. Every time you push past the last limit it builds your confidence that you'll be able to repeat history. 

As the body becomes more adapted to doing a certain kind of work, it is normal for progress to slow down. A beginner can make adapt every session, but after about 3-9 months (depending on prior training, genetics, and size) recovery starts taking longer. The typical 3 day a week work sets is too much work to compensate in time for. The trainee is then intermediate. In particular, for intermediate trainees there needs to be some variation in intensity and in work volume to facilitate active recovery and continue progress. Additionally, the more advanced a trainee becomes, the more prone to over-training they can get because they are becoming much closer to their genetic potential. A common strategy that is used by intermediate lifters is now know as the "Texas Method". The work looks similar to this: 

After that we have the recommended category. Recommended just means it works for enough people to consider it. 

You can work on your stretching right away, but when you go to your squats you'll have to do some set up work: 

That's it. If you already have low body fat (8-12% for men), you will begin to see better definition in the abdominal region. However, if you have significantly more body fat, the only thing you have to show for your work is the strength you developed. The reason the trite saying "abs are made in the kitchen" is so true is because you have to lose body fat to reveal the abs you have underneath the layers of fat. The number one tool to lose fat is a proper diet. Diet is so important that it trumps cardio and other physical activities to burn fat. Unfortunately:
