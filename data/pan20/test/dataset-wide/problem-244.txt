I am quite familiar with socialism; the most successfully socialist country is likely Norway (and no, it is not because of North Sea Oil, but high taxation). The essential idea is NOT to give everyone "just enough to pay for food and expenses." Instead, the idea is a very strong safety net so your life, your children's lives, your children's education, health, shelter and safety are not in danger if you are unemployed. As it turns out (and Norway and other socialist countries prove without doubt) people want more than survival, and will work to get it even if survival is assured. Norway provides free health care (not just health insurance, free care, period), at a very high standard of care (higher than most hospitals in the USA). Yet for-pay hospitals still exist in Norway, some are willing to pay for private rooms, private nurses, house call doctors, etc. Norway provides free education for its citizens, as much as they want (e.g. multiple PhDs, no problem), at any accredited college in the world they can get into. If you can get into Harvard, they pay the bill, and some living expenses in the bargain. Nobody is fleeing Norway because of the high taxes (top rates more than double the USA top rates); the Norwegian people are raised with it and acclimated. The richest people in Norway consider it part of their culture; they take care of each other, and giving everybody an equal start in life helps to ensure they are maximizing the potential of everybody in their country; they aren't wasting anybody by impairing them from the beginning. That said, your "dystopia" can be the difficulty of getting ahead. Misery is relative. You can be healthy, fed, sheltered and as educated as you can get, and still can't find a job to get ahead of the pack. You try to become famous as an artist, an actor, a musician, an entertainer, an author, an acrobat, and fail. You feel your life is a waste, you are kept like a pet, and you want more out of life and can't find the way to get it. School is frickin' hard and competitive, and even if you get a PhD in something, the professorial jobs are all filled, the only openings are when somebody dies and 500 PhDs apply for the spot. If you can't get ahead legally, then illegally seems like a valid option. Unlike most cyberpunk, the society is not oppressive, they are taking care of your sorry ass, but the outcome is oppressive, because between computers and highly taxed robots and other high tech AI, there is no way to escape living in a (heated, cool, safe) 200 sf room for the rest of your life. Sure, you can do anything you want, but socialism doesn't cover entertainment (well, maybe basic cable). You aren't going to travel the world, or own a fast car, or gamble in Vegas. Unless you get into the underside of life. The state will pay to train you, and then you can engage in some illegal side gigs to buy some of the illegal training, hacking and activities that could land you in prison: Benevolent socialists will still lock you up. There is still a war between the law and the criminals. That's the story hook, no matter how much people are given, they will still want more. Even if their every basic need is taken care of, they will work for more. (Look at the USA: it is possible to live on about \$1000 a month, but nearly everybody works to earn 4 or 5 times that on average, because they don't want just the bare minimum life of \$1000 a month.) In a high-tech future, most jobs done by most people today will be done by machines, for 5% of what it would cost to hire a person. Suppose 90% of people are provided socialist subsistence so food, shelter (warmed and cooled, but small), education, health care and safety are well covered. Not entertainment, not travel. You have to earn money if you want those. If you want to play chess or gin rummy in the park for the rest of your life, you are all set. If you want anything more, chances are you can't get a job no matter how hard you try, those go to the top 5% of the population in acuity and natural born skill, and 95% of us just aren't in that 5%. Once you learn you aren't: learn to play chess or get your cyberpunk on. Added Clarification on Socialism The OP thought money was distributed to the citizenry; that is seldom the case in actual Socialism, or money-distribution is a relatively smaller component of it. Socialism can simply provide services to the population, for free. So it doesn't give you money to buy healthcare, it provides health care. It doesn't give you money to rent a livable apartment, it provides you an apartment. It doesn't even have to give you money for food; but can provide you with the food. It doesn't have to give you money for transportation, it can provide public transportation (not just by bus, but in some cases taxis to transport one person to some justifiable destination; e.g. a person to a doctor's appointment). And finally, they do not have provide money for tuition and housing in college; they can just provide the college and dormitory rooms for free, funded by general taxation. In the USA and Europe, we do not give people money to pay for privately owned toll roads; for the most part we just provide the roads for free, for individual, business, and public use. Another aspect of socialism is that, besides the free services, people generally do work for money to buy better than the free services (if they want something other than the public cafeteria menu, for example, or a bigger apartment or a house). According to the IBC (International Building Code) an "apartment" can be as small as 220 sf, and that might be all that public shelter offers, per individual. (Which would have its own ramifications: Women might have children in order to be entitled to more space; people might get married or cohabit for the same reason.) I say this to improve this answer: The cyberpunk aspect comes into play because, in world where a very large % of people have been put out of work by advanced tech, those people do not necessarily have a single dollar of income, and they aren't geniuses or exceptional athletes, artists, musicians, comics, gamers or beautiful enough to be models or actors. But working together, as criminals, they might be able to steal actual money from the working people. 

children the age of 3 can be trained to recognize dangerous vs acceptable vegetable foods. At age 3 they can be in kindergarten and learning. They can also learn to acquire berries, honey, and to recognize and harvest edible insects like ants. Presuming 90% of their training is survival skills and we don't mind the occasional injury or death of children in training, around age 5 they have the mental capacity to learn making fire, using knives, knapping flint into tools like spears, etc. They can already learn to throw, they could learn to make and use atlatl and slings: A slung rock can have the impact of a 45 caliber bullet; and an experienced slinger can hit a bullseye (or a forehead) from a hundred feet: it is an under-rated hunting weapon, far easier to construct than a bow, and can use projectiles easily found. Further, it does not require the muscular strength of drawing a bow; the slung stone can be less than an ounce and the strength is just that required to swing it in a circle a half dozen times. Note that the world's youngest sharpshooter (with a gun) is only six: $URL$ I provide that as evidence of the skill level achievable by seven year olds if they are trained. I presume the children will be able to hunt small game (birds, squirrels) or even deer; will have (in class) butchered and cleaned these, and will know how to make fires and cook both the animals, and the vegetables they find. Also note six year olds are already playing baseball, they can be taught to use basic clubs, and presumably in training have already killed and eaten animals. Likewise, they can be taught to build shelters (IRL they are already building themselves forts), find water. On a coast line or river or stream, they could build nets to fish, or make basic fence traps: Sticks sharpened and hammered into a stream bed in a 'comb' pattern, to divert larger fish (those that won't fit between the sticks) into a longish channel that ends near one of the banks in a pen, or net. Rocks can be used; but you want the fence tall enough that fish can't jump it. My point here is you don't need hooks or knives or anything else; if necessary a stick can be sharpened by grinding it against natural rock, and some vines are suitable for tying into knots to make a basic net that lasts long enough to catch some food. 

In light of my above comments; I would transport about a library full of schematics, science, physics, chemistry, medicine, biology and history, history, history: of every valuable patent, how important biological and chemical discoveries were first made -- especially things like explosives, cures, refining metals, etc. I would transport this microscopically printed on very fine paper, and with it, many binocular microscopes for reading. I believe I can easily get 400 book pages per sheet (20x reduction for both length and width), front and back. I would bring support personnel, both to protect me, and to provide engineering services: The venture would be a partnership in the aim of getting rich. For a lifetime we would be pre-empting every important invention of the age by years; and in particular inventions we knew caught on like wildfire. We would exploit every major political or natural event. Strike gold and find treasure where we knew others found it, years before they had any notion of looking where they eventually found it, in History 1.0. In History 2.0, we find it first. We invent it first. We discover it first. We put forth the new ideas first. We know when the earthquakes and floods are coming, we know when the monarchs are weak and can be overthrown, we know their weaknesses. We know where to explore the unknown. Once we take over the world, we can establish a benevolent socialist Democracy like Norway and change the lives of billions for the better. 

Clothing can also serves as protection. For example, I do not wear shoes out of modesty, I use them because I don't want punctures and scrapes and thorns in my feet. Cowboys wore boots, chaps, hats and gloves to protect themselves, against snake bite, hand damage when handling rough rope with strong herd animals, and shade for sunstroke. Head covering can also retain body heat in the cold. Of course the first function of loincloths is to protect sensitive genitalia, not hide it. The hiding happens as a result of protection, and then takes on a life of its own: But it was not the first function. If you are riding a horse, scooting on on a limb of a tree, walking through tall stiff grasses or brush, or for whatever working reason might have something between your legs, something to protect your genitalia is good idea for both men and women; but especially for men with more dangly genitalia. Without a time machine to visit and ask, logic tells us the first purpose of any clothing was likely for protection (including from cold or weather), and not modesty. Obviously the "inventor" of clothing had spent a lifetime naked amongst a completely naked tribe; it is highly unlikely they began wearing some article of clothing just to hide their sexual organs. More likely, they began wearing something because it prevented injury or kept them warm. Your gorillas can still get cold: My dog has a fur coat, but definitely starts feeling the cold and wants to get inside once the temp drops to within a few degrees of freezing. The later functions of clothing; for decoration, status, concealment out of modesty, hiding sexual assets (like some Muslim garb) are all most likely add-on purposes due to human psychology: Once you start routinely hiding something, it becomes a mystery and attractive. It was not a lie that in Victorian times, men found even the ankles of women attractive, just because ankles, knees, legs were always concealed in public. Our modesty is clearly a learned response, not innate. Children learn quickly, but are hilariously immodest exhibitionists in their first years, even after acquiring language. Or perhaps they are normal, and it is the adults being ridiculous. Yes, your gorillas can have clothing. Center it on the protections they need. For example, even though we could get by without shoes, and our ancestors did for millions of years, they are so protective we do almost nothing barefoot except swimming, where they cause too much drag, and some sandy beach play activities (e.g. volleyball) where bare feet work better. For intelligent quadrupedal gorillas, I'd start with knuckle and foot protection; they will have to work with their hands extensively (like us) and cannot afford the minor cuts, punctures, and scrapes of normal walking use. Also, in time, by avoiding the callouses built up by knuckle-walking from birth; the gorillas may find that protection makes their hands more nimble with a more sensitive touch, which helps them work and makes their glove-like knuckle protection a necessity. Loin protection is always a good idea; for working females breast protection is a good idea that would likely become a cultural norm. When a clothing invention (like shoes or loincloth) becomes considered such a necessity that everyone wears it, within about an average lifetime the number of people (or whatever they call themselves) that have a living memory of things being any different will be near zero; and then the rationale for wearing the item fades into the background of our mind: We wear shoes because everybody wears shoes and we were raised from infancy wearing shoes, so much so that in most situations we expect to see shoes and think something is wrong if people are barefoot: In the office, or mall, or a barefoot cop or lawyer in court. We can even feel uncomfortable about it; as if bare feet suggested disease. Your gorillas can get cold, as they explore new territory: Much of it is very desirable for 9 months out of the year (on Earth), and bitterly cold and inhospitable in the winter. Protective clothing in these environments can help the survive the winter without leaving the place, which they could not do and protect their property: Settling down can have a lot to do with protecting property, like herds, crops you planted, ready water access, etc. Then of course, if they are intelligent as humans, these protective purposes extend to their science (working with chemicals, high voltages, machinery, sharp or dangerous objects, etc). The functional purposes apply: Hats, helmets, glasses (to correct vision problems or protect eyes). Then, within a lifetime or two, the persistently useful clothing becomes a cultural norm and subject to fashion. Social standing for expensive items becomes a thing, like our high fashion and expensive shoes. For us, purely functional items like a watch can become runaway prestige items: You can buy a watch to keep accurate time for around \$10, or spend five thousand times as much to wear a gold and jewels version that is actually less functional and accurate versus the cheap plastic digital version! Another function of clothing I did not mention: Hiding body odor and uncleanliness. Obviously we have had various body odors since our beginnings, but bad smells can be signs of disease and unfitness. We have been using perfumes and clothing to disguise and conceal such odors for thousands of years, and more recently (although not world-wide) daily (or more frequent) bathing, and clothes washing (usually after a single use). I presume (without first hand knowledge) that gorillas have all the sweat and odor problems of humans. My furred dog can get stinky. The cats don't, they keep themselves meticulously clean, likely an obsessive compulsive behavior preserved by evolution because it prevents their prey from sniffing out an ambush in the hunt; making them more successful hunters. That rationale would likely not apply to smart gorillas; and the "barrier" of fresh clothing might also help them to conceal unpleasant odors.
