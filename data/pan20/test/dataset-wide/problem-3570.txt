Work = M * G * H M being mass, which would be 125 kg(~275lb), although it would be slightly more as you are also squatting part of your bodyweight. Lets say 170kg G being Gravity, which for the formula is 9.8 meters H being height, we will say 1.5 meter (~4.5 feet, 3 feet on way up and we will say 1.5 feet down as you're moving with gravity so not as much energy is needed) =125 * 9.8 * 1.5 = 2499 Joules Since 1 joule is equal to 0.000239006 kilocalorie, you would burn about 0.60 kcal per rep. 0.6 x 25 = 15 calories. This doesnt seem right either, as I would imagine you would burn bit more calories per squat, but its closer. This is also effected greatly by your weight, metabolism, what your heart rate is while squatting, ect, ect. 

As the others have indicated, the best return on exercise involves concerted effort, pushing yourself to the limit. That said, casual exercise can also be worthwhile, at least for the purpose of staying relatively healthy. It's not "lying in bed and doing nothing", but it's also not "8x5 strong-lifts of maximum weight" or even "10 push-ups and 10 pull-ups every morning". First of all, for general exercise, walking is not a bad start. It generally doesn't require much exertion and with the addition of a book, a smart phone game, or a podcast, it can be entertaining at the same time (obligatory note, avoid distractions that prevent you from noticing your environment). If you're willing to set aside the book, you can add a bit more to your workout by making up little games to vary your routine, such as ascending the staircase into the park along the outside instead, traversing the playground equipment however it makes sense at the moment, or even just walking along a curb, trying to balance yourself. It's not intense work, but you get some of the benefits as with the horse-riding of your body having to work to maintain your equilibrium. Another option is to incorporate some sort of exercise in your times when you're stationary. A stress ball squeezed while reading forum posts online is still exercise (and good for stress relief as you imagine squeezing the necks of commenters). With a small dumb-bell, or even a bag with some books in it, you can do curls with a free hand. Even keeping yourself upright at the edge of the seat instead of leaning back in your chair works core muscles in a fairly passive manner. If you're willing to make an investment into more equipment, there are people who work on a treadmill or exercise bike (or have something under their desk to simulate the same). Lastly, there's a technique called "greasing the groove" typically used for pushing one's limits, but also usable casually, where you don't bother with a regular workout, but rather just do a few reps whenever the idea occurs to you. You can do a few pull-ups everytime you pass the door frame, do 5 push-ups every time you get up for coffee (pushing up against a wall or your desk if you want to make it easier), or doing a few lunges while your code is compiling. It's low effort, and won't build up muscle, but it's generally painless and it does reinforce the idea to your body that exercise doesn't have to hurt. 

Due to my new job, which is 9 hours of sitting and staring at the computer from 10 AM to 7PM I am going to miss my usual 5 PM gym workout. I want to get started with StrongLift 5*5 again but do it in the morning for two days. Tuesday and Thursday 7.30 to 8.30 AM and Saturday 5 to 6 PM. Because I haven't done a workout in the mornings before I'd like to know about correct eating in the morning before and after workout, plus any additional tips you guys want to share. Thanks. 

I got my form checked by a trainer today, he made a couple of good points: 1- Don't arch your lower back too much while coming down. I looked up online, and this article kind of supports it, although I have no back pain right now, increasing the weights may cause it in future. How can I maintain a neutral spine throughout? There is no uneven loading, and I am not leaning forward, but I compared my form with his on the mirror, what I noticed was he was a bit straighter than me. I will try the big breath technique next time though. 2- Keep a slight bend on your knees when you come up, or it will cause excess load on the knees. Is that even true? 3- Your elbows are coming back, this may be the cause of pain, though I have noticed my right elbow is a bit forward than the left elbow. How do I improve this? Right now I am using a medium grip with elbows pushing down and forward (but I goes away when I squat). Looking forward to improving my form on the next workout, all your suggestions are welcome. 

Your primary weight loss will be from your caloric intake. If you are taking in less than you are burning, you will lose weight. There are plenty of calculators out there to find the figures you need for consumption. Exercise, by itself, does not burn that many calories overall. Sure, run for 20 minutes and you'll manage to burn 400 calories or so, but you get that in a breakfast sandwich, and it's really easy, if you're not counting things out, to eat more than you're burning. The primary benefit of exercise is that, at a certain level of moderate exercise, the body processes food more efficiently, which reduces the health impact of things like eating more fat in your diet, or trying to survive on a restricted diet such as the vegan ones. For stair-climbing itself, the figures vary. Aman Arora is quoting from an article named Twenty Amazing Stair Climbing Facts by Stepjockey. Articles at Livestrong come up with slightly different figures. Ultimately, I'd advise assuming that you burn maybe 100 calories from it, and to focus on a small caloric reduction in your food intake with whatever gives you mild exercise. 

What would be some good additional exercises to do at the gym for 2 days a week with 7 days of tennis? Objective - Improve strength, mobility and endurance. (Not particularly in this order) I am pretty familiar with StrongLifts 5*5, which I have been following before this, but am afraid it has to stop now (don't have enough time). My routine, which I am aiming to follow is, 7 days tennis, Saturday Sunday gym, mainly compound movements like, squats (with lesser weight), overhead press, deadlift, bench press, pull ups, seated row/weight pull ups(that machine which has a rod). Please help me refine this plan. About me: 7-8 hours of sitting job, weight 60 Kgs, height 180 cm, 23 years old. Thanks a lot! :) 

This is a part of the StrongLift 5*5 Program, where one workout is Squats, Bench Press, Pendlay Row and the other is Squats, OHP and Deadlift.The weight increases by 5 pounds on every workout. While doing the pendlay row I noticed that I am basically rowing with my arms and as the weight was a bit heavier for me, I felt a twitch in the lower back too. had to leave it after 4 reps in the last two sets. Another problem is, no one at my gym knows about these rows so no one can check my form, all they say is this is bad for your lower back, stop doing it. How can I improve my row technique myself so it connects better? Or is there any alternative that I can fit into this program from my back development? 

It's usually relatively benign, the result of working a bit too hard combined with the foot flexion potentially cutting off blood flow (a common problem in heavy elliptical users), but there are more serious risks from falls resulting from lack of sensation to the numbness being caused by pinched nerves or an impending cardiac malady, so the recommendation is to stop immediately. 

It sounds like a psychological issue, to be honest. You have 20 set as your goal and thus, when you hit that goal, you freeze up. Really, you need to push through, even if it's just one or two more. Two possible strategies: 

Research is pretty divided. On one end, there are claims that it reduces performance and muscle growth by slowing muscle reaction and displacing calcium: 

I honestly don't have enough data to give you a proper answer, but I've been there before. My hands got really sore, almost swollen, and I developed calluses along there. Some of it is just unaccustomed strain, having to squeeze more tightly with your hands than your used to to hold yourself up. Some of it is the skin getting abraded, particularly if you have knurled grips (small thing that really helps on that is to take off any rings you have). In the end, it's generally something that you just have to work through, and is not, at leas tin my experience, something indicating actual permanent damage happening.
