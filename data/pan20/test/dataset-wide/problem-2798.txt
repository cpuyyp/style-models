What I would say about the above quote is that is is based upon an etymological error. Māyā and mātrā are based upon two completely different Sanskrit roots. I certainly hope his physics is based upon more careful research than this. Attempting to essentialize the differences between "the West" and "the Orient" is a bad idea to begin with, but to do so based upon a spurious etymology seems reckless beyond comprehension. 

I'd strongly recommend this video course on "The Meaning of Life" by Jay Garfield. It is an excellent overview of the subject, and follows the topic through the full scope of Western and Eastern philosophy. (I studied with Jay a few decades ago, and he's a wonderful teacher, as well as an impressive scholar.) 

How would we be able to judge the quality of the approximations (allegedly "very good") or even have a notion of the "true" knowledge of our universe except through our minds and senses? You've created a circular judgment. Finally, as to the question of "why our senses and minds are so good at approximating primitive notions of our physical universe", the immediate question is "so good compared to what?" The entire set of questions rest upon an unsupported assertion; until this assertion is argued in some manner, I'm not sure it is possible to even begin to answer the questions. 

What you are really asking here is about free will vs determinism. There's no need to bring in illusory homunculi or marionettes. 

There are two aspects to this question, a theoretical one and a practical one. I shall attempt to address each of these in turn. The theoretical question regards whether Buddhism is to be considered a philosophy or a religion. This is a definitional question; it assumes that we already have rigorous delimitations of the notions of "religion" and "philosophy"; needless to say, we don't. There is a large literature on the subject with regard to Buddhism, which comes to no real conclusion; most people consider Buddhism a religion, but this depends on the assumed definition of "religion." So, at the end of the day, it is not a useful distinction. The more practical question is whether Buddhism would conflict with your prior religious beliefs. Here, the answer is somewhat clearer: as Buddhism rejects the notion that there is anything eternal: any religion that posits an eternal God is going to be in conflict with Buddhism's main tenets. Furthermore, even if your religion posits a God that is not eternal, Buddhism rejects the notion of a creator God. However: the fact that you are planning to live with Buddhist monks while knowing so little about Buddhism itself is worrisome. I'd strongly recommend you check out a good, single-volume introduction to Buddhism, such as Peter Harvey's An Introduction to Buddhism (published by Cambridge) or Rupert Gethin's Foundations of Buddhism (published by Opus) which will give you a good overview of Buddhist doctrine. 

Well, the core idea is known as the social contract, and the canonical source is Rousseau-- but you will note there that the contract is implicit, not explicit, and that one tacitly joins into the social contract at birth. 

You're confusing the map with the territory. The choice of a theory is a motivated choice, which implies a telos--but that does not mean that the objects or processes governed by that theory are likewise teleological. The way apples fall from trees was not effected by Newton's theory of gravity. 

It's useful here to remember the distinction (most clearly interrogated by Nietzsche) between the opposition "Good/Evil" and the opposition "Good/Bad". "Evil" is a theological term; it is ultimately grounded in some sort of dogma. "Bad", on the other hand, is a pragmatic term. That which is "bad" is merely "not useful". Thus, using the latter opposition, one can point to some notion of "the good" which not necessarily founded in religious belief. This allows for the formation of all kinds of utilitarian ethics, as well as virtue (Areté) based ethics (such as Aristotelian) without any theological commitments. 

In very broad strokes: All of the definitions you propose for "dialectic" share a common, crucial factor: that truth is not static, but something that unfolds via a back-and-forth process. Plato, the scholastics, Hegel, and Kierkegaard all subscribe to this notion, and the differences in usage between them are secondary when viewed in this manner. Kierkegaard's usage of the word "dialectical" in the given quote ("Freedom is the dialectical element in the categories of possibility and necessity") is clearly Hegelian; there's nothing about his usage that Hegel could object to. (The degree to which Kierkegaard was being parodic/ironic is another matter altogether.) 

I assume we can all agree that we indubitably have the ability to doubt; it is impossible to doubt that one can doubt. So, we have to take the presence of this ability as a given. But why we have this ability? To ask this question assumes the Principle of Sufficient Reason (that is to say, that nothing happens without a reason.) Although Descartes doesn't explicitly thematize this principle (the way Leibniz, for example, does) he appears to endorse it insofar as he argues that all things ultimately come from God. (The question of whether or not God is subject to the PSR is another issue altogether, for Descartes.) So, the implied argument would be: we were created by God, and we have the ability to doubt, so therefore the ability to doubt came from God. Descartes doesn't (to the best of my knowledge) make this argument explicitly, but it seems pretty easy to connect the dots. 

I would suggest you take a look at Jacques Derrida's article "Signature Event Context", which delves into this issue. The key takeaway, for your purposes: there is no rigorous way to define (or limit) context. As for your example case: when we write "If P if correct, then P or Q is correct", we are tacitly assuming that the context is the same on both sides of the comma. In other words, we are actually saying "If P is correct in a given context, then in that same context P or Q is correct." For example: let us assign "The sky is blue" to P, and "London is the capital of France" to Q. If P is true, then P or Q is true. Arguing that P is true during the day, but not true at night is completely irrelevant; the point is that if P is true at a given point in time (i.e., for a given context), then P or Q must necessarily be true at that same point in time. 

No contradiction, any more than the presence of criminals somehow contradicts the existence of the criminal justice system. The cosmic order will take care of things in due time. The Bhagavad Gītā is a very short and relatively accessible work, available in a number of translations; I'd recommend reading it. 

Could you provide a legitimate example of a question with no perceptible difference one way or another? 

Now, clearly Perception is not in play in this case, but the other three form the means of justification available to us when reading an answer. Inference and Analogy are relatively straightforward: if the argument in the answer is logically cogent and sound, we can accept the answer, and we can similarly evaluate the answer by means of analogy to other knowledge we already have. Neither of these are specific in any way to StackExchange, of course-- they are the means we would use to evaluate any answer given to us by any third party. What is somewhat different here is the means of evaluating authority. Although external credentials (such as graduate degrees or publications) are not made prominent here, the upvoting and reputation system give a means of evaluating the relative authoritativeness of the answer (and answerer) in the eyes of the community. And that community evaluation, of course, is in turn based upon the same list of Pramāņa -s as above. 

The argument that "money equals speech" is actually fairly narrowly drawn; it is not a global philosophical principle. The notion is that because the US Constitution prohibits the restriction of free speech, any restriction on the amount of money one could use to take out political advertisements would be an unconsitutional restriction of the freedom of expression. This means that the assertion concerning "participation in an institution" being the same as or different from "speaking or using language" is irrelevant to the matter at hand-- what is at stake is limitations on the ways one can choose to make public one's speech acts. Taking out an advertisement endorsing a candidate is viewed as a speech act, but not "participation in an institution" generally. Furthermore, this entire problematic is orthogonal to the question of whether or not corporations have free speech rights. Since time immemorial, groups of citizens have banded together (ad hoc, or in unions or other organizations) to pool their resources to support a candidate; the question of whether corporations should be excluded from this practice has nothing to do with the "money equals speech" doctrine. If the Supreme Court had ruled that money did not equal speech, and that limits could be placed on the amount of money that an individual or group could spend on political advertising, this would have no bearing on whether or not corporations would be allowed to spend up to that limit. If the Supreme Court were to hypothetically rule that "speech" for the purposes of the First Amendment applied only to individual mental acts, then any kind of statement on behalf of an organization or political party could be restricted, including documents that begin "We the people..." 

How you approach this question is going to vary significantly, depending on which particular school of epistemology you are interested in. For most schools, the fact that it is a negative existential claim is not a particularly thorny part; we'd have the same difficulty trying to prove that there is a cake in this room. 

At what point does "reform" become "revolution"? Nietzsche's critique is quite radical, and ruthless, and I suspect that "Christianity" one would arrive at by following his critique would be so unrecognizable as to render the name suspect. 

In no way. To name but a few things, Hitler was anti-semitic; Nietzsche was quite vocally opposed to anti-semitism. More to the point, Hitler's rise was based almost purely on ressentiment, the opposite of what Nietzsche would want. 

But that's not all a physicist would say, as rocks are clearly made up of structures of atoms and molecules as well. Have you consulted the various definitions of life used in the various branches of science? 

I'd go for a combination of #1 and #3. The context is polemical; Nietzsche is showing an argument between him and (one or more) putative interlocutors, who Nietzsche responds to. The "free thinker" or "free spirit" in the quoted passage is an opponent who Nietzsche is in the process of dismissing, and does not represent his own views-- and the scare quotes around "free spirit" helps indicate this, if there was any doubt from the context. As an aside, this is one of the most difficult things about reading Nietzsche-- for almost any passage (taken out of context), one can find a corresponding passage (taken out of context) that argues the exact opposite. Thus, to attempt to assess Nietzsche's intent, one must read the arguments with an assiduous attention to context-- hence Nietzsche's claim that "philology is the art of reading slowly."
