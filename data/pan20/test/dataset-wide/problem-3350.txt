I thought it was a bilabial trill; maybe in coarticulation with an uvular one, at least sometimes? Sounds slightly different at the beginning of the video than later. 

I'm sorry but this cannot work without significantly stretching the boundaries of "categories" and making the task in a way arbitrary. While it's true that nouns and verbs seem to be distinguished (though not everywhere by the same means) in many (but not all) languages (and some languages do have this distinction, but it's much weaker than in, say, Latin), everything beyond that is highly dependent on the specific language. In particular the suggestion that "determiners" are in any way universal is just incredibly short-sighted. 

I think, traditionally examples like A and B would just be considered homonyms, that is as two separate lexical entries which consequently are also allowed to have different plurals. There are other examples for this in other languages. Somebody mentioned German "Wort" (although in that case the meaning distinction is slowly getting lost, I think), "Bank" (with the plural either 'Banken' or 'Bänke', depending on the meaning) is another example. C (and part of B) seems to me to just be free or regional variation. I don't see the connection to A. But of course, theories of lexical semantics differ in many regards and you will find other people using different terminology or analyses. 

It is a difference in stress, adjective 2white 1house versus compound 1white3house, but it's also a difference in rhythm. The adjective 2 1 construction is 2 measures versus the 1 measure of the compound 1 3 noun: 

In addition to the cases mentioned by Lawler in his comment, coming at the end of a constituent containing more than one word will often require stress and prevent contraction. "Would you like some ice cream?" "Yes, I'd like sm ice cream" / "Yes, I'd like some" / *"Yes, I'd like sm" / "Yes, I would" / *"Yes, I'd". 

It's hard to match up your question with your examples. The "its" in "its food" is neither an adjective nor a noun phrase. It is a definite determiner. The usual analysis is that this determiner is formed by combining a noun phrase with the "-s" ending. The definite pronoun "it" is a noun phrase, so "its" is simply a special case where the noun phrase "it" has been suffixed with "-s". Full noun phrases, not just definite pronouns, can take this same "-s" suffix to form such noun phrases as "[NP [NP the man]'s hat]", "[NP [NP a girl who I used to know]'s car]", "[NP [NP [NP the hat]'s brim]'s edge]". 

Past participles can only ever refer to objects (P) or affected intransitive subjects (Sp). This particular instance of alignment found in English participles (which some call "split intransitivity") is actually the way normal sentences work in languages such as Lakhota or Guaraní. So the true answer is: there is no pure accusative/ergative/split-intransitive language, but linguists, as anyone, need labels for effective communication. That's why we use such convenient descriptions such as "ergative language". 

I think you got that wrong. Syncretism in a number of forms (as typical in the neuter in IE languages) does not mean that the structural categories themselves merge. And a language that "fails" to distinguish nominative and accusative case everywhere, cannot really be said to have either of them. (which would mean that arguments would have to be differentiated on some other basis, e.g. head-marking, word order, direct-inverse marking or so) If you have to tag a form that could be either nominative or accusative you'd usually employ whichever is appropriate in the context; if no context is given or you need to be explicit you can also indicate the syncretism e.g. as "nom/acc" edit: and you (mostly) got that case relationship wrong. with respect to their prototypical usage, nominative, accusative and dative are closer to each other as they all express argument roles while the genitive is typically used for possessor constructions (although in a number of IE languages some verbs do actually require a genitive argument, but this is a minor pattern) 

but that might be because the subject, "one of the lizards" refers to just one thing. English has both grammatical and semantic number agreement with verbs, so maybe in the above example, the peculiarity is due to the clash in semantic agreement, and "one"" is not actually the grammatical head. If we look at NPs with "some", the verb seems to be agreeing with "lizard(s)", so maybe "some" is not the head: 

I think Catford has in mind the phonetician's distinction between a sound with a steady state and a sound without a steady state, the latter being a glide. Looking at the sound spectrograms displaying formant transitions, one can distinguish between sounds where the formants are level for an appreciable time, which is a steady state, and others where steady states cannot be found, which are glides -- parts of diphthongs. I'm skeptical. At a normal rate of speech, steady state vowels may be difficult to find. 

Before answering this question one must agree upon a definition of parts of speech. I will assume that we define POS not semantically (which would give rise to an almost infinite number of categories), but structurally, i.e. by the way they behave morphosyntactically. It is nowadays evident that POS (as any construction) cannot be established cross-linguistically. Some languages do not even distinguish between nouns and verbs, at leat not in the way English does. But even if two languages seem to share the same POS category, despite the similarities it is almost never going to be the exact same. Verbs in Russian inflect for aspect, while German ones don’t, for example. When we talk about "verbs" or "nouns" we always have in mind some prototype category that we compare language-specific categories with. When we ask "does language X have category Y", we are actually looking for something similar to Y, so the answer doesn’t have to be "yes" or "no", it will often be "somewhat". To answer the question about "like" one must consider how it behaves. Of course, it doesn’t behave like an adverb (it takes a complement), so that is ruled out by any traditional notion of "adverb". It seems to behave more like a proposition in that regard; interestingly its complement is also in the oblique case ("like him", not "like he") very unlike German for example (note however that the oblique case has long spread to constructions like coordination as well). On the top of my head I cannot think of structural features that contradict the preposition theory, but it is possible there are some (I’ve never studied English grammar in detail). There is no a priori reason why the word couldn’t be in a category all of its own. Note also that I didn’t consider the uses of like as subordinator or discourse particle. These would be other lexemes. 

The "intension" is the meaning, excluding the reference. A demonstrative "this/that", e.g., might be said to refer to something, but otherwise have no information, and so it would have no intension. I guess what Lehmann is saying is that Yucatec possession is similar to "have" in English, which says there is some sort of relationship between the subject and object of "have" but says nothing about what that relationship is. Compare the relation of "I" and "hole" in the example sentence "I have a hole in the pocket." Or "the house" and "appearance" in "The house had a strange appearance to it." 

Of course a difference between p and k is that surrounding vowels don't affect the position of articulation of p, but they do affect the position of k quite a lot. For your example of [teɪk] vs. [teɪkʲ], I would be surprised if the off glides of the diphthongs were really the same, even though you've written them both identically. The first one, before the velar [k], is probably more like barred-i, a central vowel. I suspect that, in general, the variation between palatal and velar k is more a story about English vowels than k, and that k just gets carried along for the ride. Then, also, there is a tradition in phonetics of more or less ignoring the tongue body position of consonants, because, I guess, it is often non-phonemic. If you said the t (or flap) of "auto" like you say the t of "meaty", it would sound palatalized; yet the two t's would ordinarily be transcribed the same way. Some American dialects have a lot of central off-glides, sometimes written H, in words like "hit", "pat", "pack", "beck". There's an interesting possibility this is due to a velarization of the final consonants. But I've never seen it transcribed that way. We notice the vowel change, but not the concomitant difference in the final consonants. The k in words like "bulk" sounds so far back to me, that I'd write it as a uvular. Of course, that's due to the darkening of syllable offset l. 

Most languages (excluding highly polysynthetic ones) generally have a finite set of morphological word forms. From this, it follows that the language's morphology can in the worst case be described as a regular language simply by a disjunction of all possible forms; the question remains how elegant (and how explanatorily adequate) such an approach will be. Affixation can be very easily modeled via finite state automata without the need to explicitly enumerate each possible form, but full reduplication, stem alteration (like suppletion and ablaut) or templatic morphology (as in the semitic languages) require more work. A good book on the subject is Finite State Morphology by Beesley & Karttunen (see here). Although it makes reference to a proprietary software (the xfst tool), there are open source alternatives that work very analogously. 

WALS has a chapter on numeral bases. It appears most languages use either a decimal or a vigesimal (base 20) system (or some mixture thereof, as in Basque), with other patterns being relatively rare. There are also some language that cannot actually express all possible numbers but only a limited set. Pirahã is even claimed not to have any numerals at all (but every claim about Pirahã should be taken cum grano salis). 

A complex constituent embedded in the middle of a larger constituent is difficult to understand. Ross discussed this in his dissertation Infinite Syntax (publication title) and offered some tentative suggestions about what makes a constituent complex. McCawley also covers this in his text The Syntactic Phenomena of English, and gives this example, among others: 

Being a linguist, I agree with all of them except for #5 (which is untrue). Written language is a late-developing technological development -- through most of its evolution, language has been spoken only (or sung). However, I'll suggest to you that it doesn't matter, from a scientific perspective. Scientific theories are generally taken to define their own subject matter. If quantum mechanics is found to provide an explanation of the origin of galaxies, no one will object that galaxies are the proper domain of astronomy and not of physics. The explanation comes first. So, if it should happen that the next big linguistic theory gives a central place to punctuation, linguists will have to change their minds and concede to writing a less peripheral place in the analysis of human language. In the meantime, if you look at the theories of human language currently under discussion, you'll see that there is no appeal to writing at all. So far, there is no support for writing playing any essential role in human language. 

No. I have yet to meet structural categories in linguistics that have single, universally agreed upon definitions. Even "word" is not strictly defined in any way. You can compare terms only within the same framework. "Mediopassive" is a term used generally in historical linguistics for a certain kind of language-particular constructions/forms - anticausative is a term i know from typology. Unless given a precise definition of the terms, I don't think it is possible to answer your question. 

To be honest, generative notions of word classes don't seem any less whimsical to me than the classical ones, as they are no less biased. Of course, this will be a matter of hot debate, but I side with Haspelmath (and a lot of other typologists as well, see e.g. Bickel (2007)) who claims that there is no such thing as true cross-linguistic categories. To ask whether Japanese does have the same linguistic category that a completely unrelated language, English, has (maybe, if 'determiner' even is a valid category for English) seems absurd. The question would be easier to answer if we had a clear, operationalised definition of "determiner" that can be readily applied to all sorts of languages (but I doubt anybody could come up with that). 

Wikipedia has some discussion of learnability along with relevant references: Language identification in the limit. And here is an interesting paper by Geoff Pullum: Learnability. 

I don't see the relevance of questions. There are declarative counterparts to all of your examples that are questions. The oddity of your example "Does Restaurant X have many people?" is duplicated by the oddity of "Restaurant X has many people", so, again, the fact that it is a question is irrelevant. The oddity itself is due to the absence of any coreferent to "Restaurant X" in the verb phrase. Compare "Restaurant X has many people in it," which sounds better, though it's colloquial and somewhat more specific in meaning. The requirement for a coreferent in this type of "have" sentence varies according to various factors, like whether "have" expresses inalienable possession. I gave a paper about this at CLS 4 (4th Regional Meeting of the Chicago Linguistic Society) back in, uh, 1966, I think.
