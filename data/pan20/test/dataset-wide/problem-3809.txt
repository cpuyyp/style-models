Added: Vaserstein proved his result soon after Shalom proved and gave talks on a Kazhdan Property T result relying on the fact that for a ring $R$ of stable rank $d$, $\mathrm{SL}_r(R)$ for $r\ge d+1$ is boundedly generated by elementary matrices along with its upper left copy of $\mathrm{SL}_{d+1}(R)$. For $d=2$ this is of course the easy result on stable rank 2 retrieved later (link in Andrei's post). This is briefly mentioned in Shalom's ICM 2006 paper, with a reference to a paper which never appeared, and explained in detail in 2006/07 pdf notes of mine based on his talks. Combining Shalom and Vaserstein's result lead to the result that the subgroup generated by elementary matrices in $\mathrm{SL}_r(R)$ has Property T for every finitely generated commutative ring and $r\ge 3$. What happened a bit later is that the Property T result was obtained by other means, not using bounded generation, by Ershov and Jaikin-Zapirain (Inv. Math. 2010), in a wider generality ($R$ not necessarily commutative). This superseded the Property T result, but not Vaserstein's beautiful bounded generation result, which obviously is of interest independently of Kazhdan's Property T. 

Among free nilpotent Lie algebras the possible nilradicals of parabolics are exactly (up to 1 case): 

The negative answer is equivalent to showing that there are two disjoint subsets $A,B$ of $\mathbf{N}^2$ with non-disjoint closures in $(\beta\mathbf{N})^2$. This be made explicit: take $A=\{(n,m):n=m\}$ and $B=\{(n,m):n>m\}$. Let $\omega$ be a non-principal ultrafilter on $\mathbf{N}$. Let $V$ be a neighborhood of $(\omega,\omega)$ in $(\beta\mathbf{N})^2$. Then $V$ contains $U\times U$ for some $U\in\omega$. The latter contains both points of $A$ and of $B$. Since this holds for every $V$, this shows that $(\omega,\omega)$ belongs to the closure of both $A$ and $B$. 

The answer is no: actually by Baumslag-Roseblade (1984: [BR]) either $G$ is commensurable to a product of free groups (hence has linear or quadratic Dehn function), or is not finitely presented (so the Dehn function is infinite, or not defined, as you wish). The latter case occurs if $H$ is an infinite word hyperbolic group and $f:F_m\to H$ is a non-bijective surjection and $H$ is the fibre product $$\{(g,h)\in F_m\times F_m:f(g)=f(h)\}.$$ Edit 1 (reply to Lee Mosher's comment, copy from a comment dated Sep 14 '12) In general the Dehn function of $H$ is equivalent to the distortion of $G$. This is not completely formal (there's a little Van Kampen diagram cuisine) but in the case of $H=\mathbf{Z}$ it's simple to verify by hand. I saw the general result written somewhere but I can't remember right now. Edit 2 (Extracted from Robert Young's comment to his reply) There's a proof for [this non-distortion fact] mentioned in Olshanskii, Sapir [0S, Theorem 2]. 

Here is an example where they are not isomorphic (where the $G_i$ are countable abelian groups). Write $C_k$ for the cyclic group of order $k$ and $C_k^{(I)}$ the group of finitely supported functions $I\to C_k$. Let $I,J$ be two disjoint infinite countable sets, and define $G=C_2^{(I)}\oplus C_4^{(J)}$, here $C_2^{(I)}$ has a basis $(e_i)_{i\in I}$ as a free $\mathbf{Z}/2\mathbf{Z}$-module and $C_4^{(J)}$ has a basis $(e_j)_{j\in J}$ and $(e_j)_{j\in K}$ as a free $\mathbf{Z}/4\mathbf{Z}$-module. Let $j_0\subset J$ be some distinguished element. Let $H$ be the subgroup of $G$ (of index 2) generated by the $e_i$ for $i\in I$, $e_j$ for $j\in J\smallsetminus\{j_0\}$, and $e_{j_0}^2$. Let us define $G_n=G$ (I avoid to write $G_i$). We will construct two isomorphisms $\phi,\varphi:G\to H$, which are thus injective endomorphisms of $G$ with the same image, and define $\phi=\phi_n$, $\varphi=\varphi_n$ for all $n$. Fix a bijection $c:J\to J\smallsetminus \{j_0\}$ and an element $i_0\in I$. Define $\phi(e_{i_0})=\varphi(e_{i_0})=e_{j_0}^2$, and $\phi(e_j)=\varphi(e_j)=e_{c(j)}$ for all $j\in J$. It remains to define $\phi$ and $\varphi$ on $C_2^{(I\smallsetminus \{i_0\})}$, using two distinct bijections $u,v:I\smallsetminus\{i_0\}\to I$ with suitable requirements. With no requirement, define $\phi(e_i)=e_{u(i)}$ and $\varphi(e_i)=e_{v(i)}$ for all $i\in I\smallsetminus\{i_0\}$: then $\phi$ and $\varphi$ are isomorphisms $G\to H$. For $\varphi$ we only make the requirement that $v$ has a fixed point $i_1$ in $I\smallsetminus \{i_0\}$, this can obviously be realized. For $\phi$ we wish that every element of $I$ is eventually mapped to $i_0$. For this, we write $I=\{i_n:n\ge 0\}$ and define $u(i_n)=i_{n-1}$ for all $n\ge 1$. Then $u$ is indeed a bijection from $I\smallsetminus \{i_0\}$ to $I$, and clearly any iterate of any point eventually lands in $\{i_0\}$. Let now $\Sigma_\phi$ and $\Sigma_\varphi$ be the direct limits. Then $\Sigma_\phi$ has the property that every element of order 2 is a square, unlike $\Sigma_\varphi$. This is because for every element of order 2 $x$ in $G$ there exists $n$ such that $\phi^n(x)$ belongs to $C_4^{(J)}$, and hence is a square, while there exists $x$ (namely $x=e_{i_1}$) in $G$, of order 2, not a square, and fixed by $\varphi$, so $x$ is not a square in $\Sigma_\varphi$. 

Let us first check that (1.) is equivalent to the existence of a retraction in restriction to $K^*\mathrm{SL}_n(K)$ (the subgroup generated by homotheties and unimodular matrices). Clearly it implies it (consider the set of scalar matrices whose diagonal entry belongs to this direct summand). Conversely, if there is a retraction, its kernel has trivial intersection with $\mathrm{SL}_n(K)$, hence contained in its centralizer, which is reduced to scalar matrices, so it should form the set of scalar matrices with diagonal entry in some direct summand of the set $n$-roots of unity in $K^*$. Now it is clear that $K^*\mathrm{SL}_n(K)$ equals $\mathrm{GL}_n(K)$ if and only if (2.) holds; so if both (1.) and (2.) hold it follows that we have a retraction; conversely if we have a retraction, its kernel is a normal subgroup with trivial intersection with $\mathrm{SL}_n(K)$, hence contained in its centralizer, which is reduced to scalar matrices, so $\mathrm{GL}_n(K)$ should be generated by unimodular and scalar matrices, i.e. (2.) holds, and then the first verification shows that (1.) holds. Edit: as noticed by Julian Rosen, (2.) together with (1.) implies something much stronger than (1.), namely that the subgroup of $n$-roots of unity is actually trivial, which means that $x\mapsto x^n$ is injective on $K$. To conclude: 

(Note that obviously every elementary matrix is a product of a bounded (bound depending only on $r$) number of (elementary) matrices in one of the diagonal $\mathrm{SL}_2$.) For somewhat absurd reasons, this paper is unpublished. I did in 2007 a detailed check of the proof, including a careful reading of his long 1976 paper with Suslin on which the paper strongly relies. Vaserstein's paper can be found on his web page: $URL$ the above theorem follows from his Corollary 2. Note that in case of finitely generated algebra over a field/PID, this is considerably more general than what is cited in Andrei's answer: the case of BÃ©zout rings is strictly contained in the case of Krull dimension 1, and the case of stable $\le 2$ does not much go beyond Krull dimension 2: it covers the case of Krull dimension 1 and also maybe a few rings of Krull dimension 2. (Input welcome! I do not know if there's a commutative algebra that is finitely generated over a PID, has stable rank $\le 2$ and Krull dimension $\ge 2$. There is a MO post resulting in the conclusion that $\mathbf{Z}[x]$ has stable rank 3. According to this paper by Gabel (Pacific J. Math. 1975), polynomial rings over fields with $s\ge 4$ indeterminates have stable rank $\ge 3$, and for subfields of the real field this already holds when $s\ge 2$.) 

It's true if and only if every $F$-simple factor of $G$ is $F$-isotropic (i.e., has nonzero $F$-rank). Indeed, if this is the case, then we can reduce to the $F$-simple case. By Theorem 5.1 in Margulis' book (which uses the simple connectedness assumption), $G(F)$ is generated by its 1-dimensional unipotent subgroups, which are isomorphic to $F$ as groups and hence have no proper subgroup of finite index. Hence $G(F)$ has no proper of finite index. Conversely, if $G$ has a simple factor $H$ that is $K$-anisotropic, then $H(F)$ is an infinite profinite group and is a direct factor of $G$, so this yields open subgroups in $G$ of arbitrary large index. 

If $G$ is nondiscrete, the answer is clearly no, since the trivial group is approximable by compact open subgroups. If $G$ is discrete (this is not the kind of groups you had in mind), the answer is yes unless $G$ has an infinite locally finite subgroup. The terminology "locally profinite" (not used by group theorists), which stands for "locally compact totally disconnected", is lame because for discrete groups it does not mean locally finite (which means every finite subset generates a finite subgroup). 

In some cases you have an even simpler characterization. Indeed, a theorem of Witte (arXiv link) can be restated as: a finitely generated amenable group $G$ admits a nontrivial order-preserving action on a totally order set (or on the real line, it's the same) if and only if it admits $\mathbf{Z}$ as a quotient. 

It's an exercise to check it coincides with $\mathrm{Aut}(S_6)$ which has $S_6$ as subgroup of index 2. Here are the steps. First, for arbitrary $n\ge 6$, consider the graph of transpositions. So this is the set $X_n$ of the $n(n-1)/2$ unordered pairs, with an edge between two whenever they are disjoint. On $X_n$, consider the set $Y_n$ all unordered pairs of non-joined vertices (hence of the form $\{\{a,b\},\{a,c\}$ for $a,b,c$ pairwise distinct. There's a canonical map $\phi:Y_n\to\{1,\dots,n\}$ given by $\phi(\{\{a,b\},\{a,c\})=a$; we wish to show it's equivariant for the group action. Link two elements of $Y_n$ if they are disjoint and contained no pair of joined vertices. Then any two linked elements of $Y_n$ have the same image by $\phi$ (check! this uses the disjointness assumption). Next consider the equivalence relation on $Y_n$ generated by this equivalence relation. The only 2-element subsets in $Y_n$ with same image by $\phi$ but not linked have the form, up to permutation, $\{\{12,13\},\{12,14\}\}$. But one indeed have $\{12,13\}-\{15,16\}-\{12,14\}$. So for $n\ge 6$, the equivalence relation on $Y_n$ generated by being linked consists of being in the same fibers of $\phi$, and hence the automorphism group of $X_n$ acts on $\{1,\dots,n\}$. This action is easily seen to be faithful. Since the permutation group $S_n$ already acts, this shows that the automorphism group of $X_n$ is $S_n$. Next in $S_n$ for $n\ge 7$, the transpositions are the only elements whose centralizer has order $2(n-2)!$, i.e., form the only conjugacy class of order $n(n-1)/2$, and hence $\mathrm{Aut}(\mathrm{Comm}(S_n))$ stabilizes its subgraph $X_n$. Again a little argument shows that this action is faithful (i.e. an automorphism of $\mathrm{Comm}(S_n)$ fixing pointwise the transpositions is the identity; also for $n=6$. For $n=6$ on the other hand, there are 2 conjugacy classes of order 15: transpositions and triple transpositions. They are switched by non-inner automorphisms. Hence the previous argument applies to the subgroup of index 2 of $\mathrm{Aut}(\mathrm{Comm}(S_6))$ stabilizing $S_6$ and the result follows.
