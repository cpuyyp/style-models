My comment notwithstanding, here's a solution to a homework problem that does the calculation. It doesn't specify the exact mechanism that converts angular momentum (aka rotational energy) into electromagnetic radiation. In this case, it is just an assertion of the problem (partially justified with what I said in my comment: the energy must come from somewhere, and if there doesn't seem to be any sources other than angular momentum, then it must be coming from the angular momentum). Slightly rephrasing that link's content for the sake of future accessibility: 

The wikipedia page you linked to tells you that the solar system is gravitationally "chaotic", in part because the mass of the sun is not fixed over time. But even more simply than that, focusing just on the gravity (ignoring loss of stellar mass, etc.), the solar system is an N-body problem. We have 8 planets, a sun, and millions of asteroids, comets, and who knows how many individual particles gravitationally bound to our sun (plus ones that aren't and are just passing through the neighborhood, so to speak). When you have more than 2 bodies, the solutions to the N-body problem are unstable. What this means is that, say we describe the N-body problem with data $D$ (the "initial conditions", or a perfect description of the state of the system at some specific point in time). With a given complete data set the (Newtonian) gravitational evolution of the system is completely determined (but so difficult to do we can only approximate it). What instability means here is that if we have some other data set $D'$ that is only a little bit different from $D$, then the differences between the evolution from $D$ and $D'$ will become exponentially large over long enough time scales. So what may seem like minor differences now will result in radically different looking solar systems in the long run. Since all of our observations can never give exact values, but only a range of values, there is necessarily a bit of uncertainty in what the exact gravitational state of our solar system is. We have very poor data on the exact asteroid and comet content of our solar system, and even planetary data has significant error margins. All of this means that there are lots of justifiable picks for the data $D$, each differing by a small amount from each. But due to the instability, eventually these data will produce radically different futures from each other. Currently we can only predict the solar system's evolution up to a few million years or so (the exact value stated can vary wildly depending on how you opt to define and compute the Lyapunov time). After that the evolutionary tracks become so disparate we can't really say we're predicting anything other than "it'll definitely do something". One way or another, it is currently impossible for us to make any clear assertions about what the solar system will look like on a timescale of billions of years. Maybe all 8 planets will still be there; maybe their orbits will be very similar, but maybe they'll have much different orbits; maybe several planets will have been ejected from the solar system. At best we can observe a few things that lead certain objects to be most likely to undergo significant alteration. For example, Jupiter and Mercury appear to have a certain orbital resonance right now which could ultimately lead Mercury to undergo a significant orbit change. This may ultimately cause it to collide with another planet, or the sun, or be ejected from the solar system entirely. But maybe it won't. It's hard to say. 

Yes, that is what it means. Pretty much each star in the Milky Way that does not orbit another star or object revolves around the SMBH. All planetary systems (solar systems) in our galaxy revolve around that point. It'a likely that most galaxies have supermassive black holes at their centers, so usually each system orbits the SMBH(s) at the center. There actually may be more than one at the center, and in that case, the the stars and other objects will revolve around that system of supermassive black holes. But however, the SMBH isn't enough to keep the galaxy together. It also needs some of the gravity from the stars, nebulae, planets etc. that make it up. 

I know that a a planet or moon's rotation will slow down or speed up until it is tidally locked with a body, is Pluto's rotation being affected by the sun or is it being forced by Charon just to to be tidally locked with Charon? 

If I understand correctly, red dwarfs consume all of their hydrogen and will eventually shrink into helium white dwarfs, whereas the higher mass stars will consume a fair amount of their hydrogen fuel, not necessarily all of it. Correct me if I'm wrong. 

Keep in mind that there are probably more ways for binary stars to form. Also, a collision isn't very likely to form these systems. 

I was looking at a wikipedia article ($URL$ and I came across an interesting aspect that said pulsars turn off from rotation. What I don't understand is why emission of EM waves would slow a pulsar down? 

I have been researching this on google, and I think there is a process. What is this process called? I have forgotten. 

The best way to tell the difference between planets and stars is: (From here) Early astronomers were able to tell the difference between planets and stars because planets in our Solar System appear to move in complicated paths across the sky, but stars don't. That is, if you observe the sky night after night, the stars will all appear in fixed positions with respect to each other. They will rise and set a few minutes earlier each night (an effect that is due to the Earth's motion around the Sun), but otherwise nothing will change. This is why the background stars are sometimes referred to as the "celestial sphere" -- from our point of view, it looks like the stars are "painted" onto a gigantic sphere that surrounds Earth and therefore are unable to move with respect to each other. Planets, on the other hand, are observed to move in very complicated paths with respect to the background stars, sometimes even appearing to go "against the grain" and reverse their directions. Therefore, they are easily distinguishable from stars if you look at the sky night after night. Although ancient astronomers did not have a correct explanation for this phenomenon, we now know that the complicated motion is just a projection effect -- it is due to the fact that Earth and the other planets are physically moving in orbits around the Sun, so the planets' relative positions as seen from Earth (with respect to the fixed background stars) change as time goes on. There are other observational differences between planets and stars too, by the way -- such as the fact that planets almost never twinkle. Like the text said, if an object doesn't twinkle, it's most likely to be a planet. If you observe it every night, and it appears to change its position more than stars do. Although stars also change their positions, they don't change their positions in the sky as much as planets throughout the year. Stars maintain positions relative to one another, constellations are a great to tell the difference between planets in stars. What I mean by maintaining their positions is that each night they are usually in the same pattern and usually the same distance apart in the night sky. 

The solid black orbits are the gas giant orbits, with Jupiter being the innermost one, and Saturn the one after that. The dashed circle represents a 2 AU distance from the sun (modern day Mars is currently at about 1.5 AU, and the modern asteroid belt stretches roughly 2.2-3 AU). This is noteworthy since the model is trying to explain why Mars is so small, and why there is so little material (relatively speaking) in the asteroid belt. The numerous small blue dots are the icy comets/planetesimals that form right around the point Jupiter starts out, and points beyond. The numerous red dots are the rocky asteroids/planetesimals characteristic of the inner solar system. For the first several seconds we see Jupiter creep in towards the inner solar system. You'll notice a lot of rocky planetesimals get scattered out into the outer solar system, while some of the icy ones are scattered to the inner solar system. Indeed, it seems to be a general feature of this model that the total amount of material within approximately 1 AU undergoes a net increase. Saturn is also slowly moving in, but not nearly as quicky as Jupiter is (Neptune/Uranus seem pretty stable, but do "pulse" in and out a bit). 

By observation, gravity dominates the universe on large scales. If there were a significant disparity in positive and negative charges then we would expect electromagnetism—which is approximately $10^{39}$ times more powerful than gravity—to dominate. So by this observation we can conclude that the universe is approximiately electrically neutral. Exactly why this should be so is not well-understood, and ultimately ties into the matter-antimatter problem, aka the baryon asymmetry. Protons and electrons are produced through distinct processes. That we have many protons is not particularly remarkable, as this would come about by conservation of baryon numbers as other particles decayed. Why we have any electrons at all is a fair bit more mysterious. In the early universe, we understand the energy was well above the electron-positron pair production threshold, and so the early universe had large amounts of both electrons and positrons. When the universe cooled below this threshold, the production would have stopped and we would expect the electrons and positrons to then collide and annihilate each other, leaving essentially none of either. But we obviously see large amounts of electrons: approximately as many electrons as protons by the aforementioned observational evidence. And we also do not see large amounts of antimatter—positrons in particular. If there were large amounts of positrons out there, we would expect to see tell-tale signatures in space as they annihilate with regular matter (or in any weak force interactions, such as would be evident in supernovae), and we have no such observations. So somehow the early universe must have produced significantly more electrons than positrons. In other words, we have strong observational evidence that there must be an asymmetry in physics between matter and antimatter production. There are ways to work this into the theory, but the Standard Model by default does not support it, and experts have not really settled on any one particular modification. 

This site offers a pretty good detailing of the basic structure of the Grand Tack Hypothesis. The most digestible piece of information is at the very bottom, in the form of an AVI file that models the first few million years of the solar system. The short answer to your question is "Jupiter is assumed to have already formed some fundamental core at the start of the hypothesis, then moves around accreting and scattering things through the inner solar system, until returning to the outer solar system to finish growing". The initial inward migration is caused by interactions with the relatively thick gaseous disc (the majority of it will never become part of any planet), which creates drag on the planets/planetesimals and causes them to lose velocity and fall inward. But the video's pretty cool, so I'm going to link it and talk about it just for its own sake. Get the video, as produced by the paper Walsh et. al., 2011 You may find it best to run this at half speed or slower to really see what's going on. Here's how it starts out.
