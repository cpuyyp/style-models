It seems intuitive to me to think that if there is a basic substance or building block of nature (e.g. fermions and leptons, etc.), then all facts regarding entities comprised of that substance are reducible into facts about instances of said substance. For example, the term "water" is reducible, on a chemical level, to "two hydrogen atoms combined with an oxygen atom via covalent bonds." In turn, this chemical equivalent of "water" is reducible to something like "two sets of identical combinations of subatomic particles combined with another unique combination of subatomic particles via [insert some atomic description of covalent bonds] (I'm no physicist)." I like to think that this process can proceed until we reach the most basic of substances, at which point we would arrive at the most primal description of a phenomena. I think topics of the social sciences are subject to this as well. For instance, "a language" can be reduced to "particular sets of certain reverberations used in certain groups of massive collections of subatomic particles (people) who engage in brain states that correlate both/either artifacts of physical substance and/or brain states with some of those particular reverberations of sound." Obviously, you could go "deeper" in the analysis, but for the sake of time and my sanity, I won't try to do any better; you probably get the idea. That was just my understanding of a typical reductionist project, but I have a feeling that I might have just conflated reductionism with physicalism. My question still stands, regardless: What are some of the problems with reducing natural and social phenomena into facts about the primary substance of which they are all ultimately made of? 

However, a can be true for all Y for other reasons. The conclusion might be valid, but the argument is not. This becomes more obvious with a nonsensical statement: 

No. I disagree with the majority of answers given, which all fall into the same logical trap. They all follow the form: 

Obviously, a dress cannot be a sky (category error), so its blueness cannot depend on this non-fact. The fact that it is actually blue fits to the argument by coincident (or because it was crafted this way), but it does not actually follow from the argument. So this is a fallacy. In fact, this one: $URL$ 

There is a great confusion here stemming from language. You use the words "past" and "already happened". But as soon as you invent time travel, those words don't mean the same thing anymore. If you can change it, then how did it already happen? If you change it and it does not happen, did it happen because it happened before you changed it, or did it never happen? Our ethics likewise assume a linear, single-strand chain of events. One thing or another thing could happen, which one is better? This follows our understanding of time as being linear and single-stranded, i.e. there is one timeline. Does this still hold true with time travel? Paradoxes are a main topic of SciFi literature, because you cannot have time travel and not create paradoxes. Any theory of how time reacts to time travellers needs to resolve paradoxes, such as postulating that minor events are smoothed out (e.g. the air molecules that time traveller displaces return to their "ordinary" position instead of causing a chain reaction). This creates a ton of physics problems (e.g. which force returns them to their position?) and is generally ignored in SciFi. The best treatment of time I've seen so far is the Doctor Who approach - time is wobbly wibbly and unpredictable, and stop worrying so much about it because you can't predict the long run anyway, but you can do the right thing in the time and place you find yourself in. From this flows a clear answer to the ethical question: Assuming time travel is possible, you have to abandon your linear, single-causal thinking. Your ethical system just broke down completely, because you can no longer think like that. Between "Bob killed 10 people" and "I go into the past to kill Bob" and "I killed Bob, so Bob cannot kill someone in the future" there is no longer a simple chain of causes. Whatever paradox-resolution is found to be true, it will by necessity negate your logic. For example, if the above causal chain were true, the first statement becomes false at the conclusion of the third one, invalidating the whole chain. You cannot ask the ethical question without resolving the physical first, namely how this all works. Time travel is not a small thing to add to the equation, it's an entirely new equation and will require an entirely new ethics. 

In my original I have 人 instead of 王 in chapter 25, so I read "people is also great" instead of "the (sage) king is also great". The original here also uses 人, though all three translations there translate 王 (the "representative of Heaven and Earth" -- Heaven is the top row, Earth the bottom row, and their representative, the middle row, connects top and bottom). Anyway, from Daoist general point of view, we humans are bound to the rules of Nature/Dao, just like any other species. Since we're not different, we don't deserve any "special treatment": DDJ 5 

The existence of many different mythologies - with no god, one god and many gods - makes it clear that diversity is the rule, and also the richness of human experiences on Earth. So, no argument could ever be decisive about any of them, unless probably, the view that in diversity resides the real value. 

In addition to the excellent answers given so far, you view this question in the light of something you call a "plan" or "laws", which you just pulled out of thin air. Question your presupposition. The butterfly effect is also an excellent philosophical tool to illustrate that there is no plan and cannot be. (the exact proof here is lengthy, but trivial) Now what you might mean by these words is determinism, but if we have learnt anything in the past century, it is that determinism only exists as a law of averages on the macro scale. The main philosophical effect of the butterfly effect is to remind us of this, and of the fact that under certain circumstances, a tiny change in the underlying causes can cause a ripple effect that causes dramatic changes in the result. The butterfly effect is only the most extreme example of that. Another great example from everyday life is what Gottmann calls "sliding doors". Imagine catching the train, and you are almost late. The fraction of a second that decides if you just make it or the doors close just in front of you can make you late for one hour (or more, depending on how often the train goes). That's a factor of 10,000 or so between cause and effect. Maybe that more down-to-earth example helps to understand the butterfly effect also in a less abstract way. 

I can't think of a specific term, but the closest one that I remember is called the fallacy fallacy: dismissing an opponent's conclusion as false/unworthy of consideration merely because fallacies were present in their argument. 

From what I've collected, Quine seemed to have solved the problem of non-being by using Russell's theory of definite descriptions through the negation of the x having certain properties/descriptions. However, I hear Kripke rejected Russell's definite descriptions. How did Kripke solve the problem of non-being with his theory of reference? 

I think a possible solution might not lie in the truth or our knowledge of the truth of theory-laden theories or hypotheses as much as in their usefulness. Even if everything might be theory-laden, we still get magnificent results from the application of science. Although we can't claim with certainty to have knowledge or knowledge of the truth of phenomena, we can still make predictions and inventions for the sake of their products. In this light, then, we might be able to refute the anti-vaxxer or climate change denier by comparing his predictions and according results with a credible scientist's predictions and according results; the conceptual scheme that made more accurate predictions than the other would then qualify as "better" (albeit not "true"). Then, depending on how inaccurate the results turned out, we should reject the science-denier's theory/hypotheses on the grounds that it would simply be not worth our time. Alternatively, if the anti-science advocate's policies were enacted and harm arose from it, e.g. more and more children would begin to die of polio, then we could use these adverse effects as justification to reject their theory. To put it more simply, we should only accept the scientific community's conclusions on climate change or vaccines if they are more useful to believe. I'm more confident with this solution in the context of the natural sciences, but I would think it would still be applicable in social and political issues as well. Intuitively, I would respond that the relativism of social and political issues could be avoided if we only accepted falsifiable hypotheses, but that solution is obviously off the table. I'm no scholar, and I'm not sure if Quine or Kuhn or any of those you mentioned would even espouse this view, but I still think it is relevant and doesn't clash with theory-laddenness assumptions. 

If you apply Aristotelian logic, then an argument containing an invalid premis cannot be valid. It cannot be invalid, either. It is meaningless. 

In addition to the wonderful answers already given, I'd like to add a very practical view: "God" as a term is so ill defined that it can mean virtually anything, and it is in fact constantly re-defined by believers to evade any falsification that science offers. For example, "heaven" and "hell" were understood as actual places for millenia. Hell being the more obvious one as being derived pretty much verbatim from Greek mythology, were several heroes actually visit it by entering underground caves. But as soon as science advanced enough to actually visit or check thoroughly both space and underground, both of them became more abstract concepts. The same is happening to "god". Whenever science progresses into an area where "god" was said to reside, and inevitable finds nothing, the concept "god" is redefined to be more abstract, less touchable. Eventually, "god" will retreat entirely into the virtual, where a proof or disproof is fundamentally impossible. But we should not close our eyes to the fact that this has nothing to do with whether or not "god" is fundamentally unfalsifiable, but rather with the fact that the term "god" actually does not possess any definition at all, and evades the grasp of science purely out of ontological reasons. 

Quantum mechanics inside our brain could, a priori, create the sort of randomness that allow for a "free will" theory. But since we have no idea of what goes on inside our heads, even in a totally deterministic scenario there would still be room for free will. The point with evolution and anthropology, though, is that all known cultures, and also other related primates, value and avoid many of the same things. This limits the role of free will, but doesn't eliminate it. 

What wouldn't be philosophical? The human thought is composed of symbols, words and language, all subject of study of philosophy. So, nothing "becomes" philosophical. Something may be "pushed out" of the field, for politics, morality, and the like, but not "pushed in". It was always there. Actually, philosophy is the widest word we use to systematize our knowledge. "Science" is more restrict because of its methodology. "Religion" is more restrict because of its dependence on "faith". Philosophy is the basis of them all (even when the faithful does not know it). For instance, "philosophy of biology" is a functional part of "biology" itself. How can any knowledge be deprived of its philosophy? Wouldn't it stop being a knowledge, and become simply dogma? Looks like you are using a very narrow definition of "philosophy". Why?
