I have done it and it worked fine. Another alternative is to drill the correct size hole in the opposite side of the wheel - thus you can run presta or schrader in the same rim. I inherited the wheels set up this way. The person explained his reasoning that he preferred to just pump up the tire after a flat rather than changing tubes or patching. My questions about puncturing the newly inflated tires immediately after got me a dim look since it sounded like he didn't bother to do any triage to remove the cause of the flats... 

I use only a front brake on my fixed gear. Between that and resisting pedaling I have not had a problem. I don;t go very fast on the fixed gear so this also reduces the need for emergency/panic stops of the kind I have had to do with a road bike. you can put front and rear brakes on a fixed gear, but probably not necessary. I would not ride one without a brake though. 

Given that we're moving away from QRs to through-axles - partly driven by the torque needs of disc brakes, why not follow the natural progression and move the wheel bearings from the hub to the forks themselves. Generally you want bearings as close to the load as possible. Having them in the fork is as close as one could hope. It'd also allow the axle to be very thick, which would add strength. Given that every idea in bicycling has been tried at least once, has this been done before? What are the demerits of such an idea? 

It depends on the type of adhesive. Sometimes it can be just pulled off. Sometimes the gentle heat of a hairdryer (not a heat gun) can weaken an adhesive and make it easier to remove. Or you can try the use of GooGone or similar adhesive thinner/solvent (try on an inconspicuous place first to make sure it won't damage the finish). Heat and solvent cover 90% of cases. If the protector was epoxied on, then it is very hard to take off without damaging the finish. 

If you want simple and easy to fix then you sure as heck don't want tubulars. Someone else will probably provide more details and links, but clinchers are rims/wheels with a tube, then a tire is mounted over the tube and the bead of the tire is hooked under a lip on the rim. Tubular rims have no lip. The tire encases the tube completely and is sewn in typically. SO fixing a flat means cutting open the tire and patching the tube, then sewing it back up. The tire assembly is glued to the rim. Heat from brakes can melt the glue supposedly and cause tires to roll off. The rolling resistance used to be much better on tubulars. Unless you are a purist or a pro I don't think there is a reason to go with tubulars these days. 

What is the best way to cut a (33.9mm alu) seatpost? Can I just use a rotary plumbing pipe cutter? The edges of a seatpost appear to be deburred or smoothed, what's the best way to achieve this? There's no minimum insertion markings. Is there a rule of thumb in their absence? 

you want to find a light that uses an elastic (rubber/silicone) band that can stretch around your elliptical seat post: 

You can rotate the key back and forth while you insert it, That should help realign the cylinders. This actually a common problem and doesn't mean that the lock is broken. Take it to your bike shop if you continue to have problems. They are experts at the jiggle-dance sometimes necessary to get the key in. 

I initially looked for a reflective vest but then found very inexpensive LED lights. I got a red one that I put on the rear that I set to flashing mode, then another white one for a front "headlight" and another red one I clip on my backpack or other place near the rear of the bike. I also bought a few reflecting tape pieces and hang them around the rear of the bike. 

It isn't the bike. It is the rider. Unless you are at 6% body fat and have done all you can to improve your output your best improvement in speed is yourself. 

Have you considered a trailer? This also allows local unloaded trips from a base without all the gear loaded. Keeps weight down low too. 

How much "like" does it have to be? I have seen trailers that clamp onto the seat post. These have the added advantage that when unhooked from the bike, you can use it like a hand truck. I used to go grocery shopping with a Burley axle-mount, and had to rearrange the groceries when I lowered the tow-bar to axle height. In one model I saw, the cargo compartment was easily removable from the frame and had straps to make it a backpack. UPDATE: I now have a Cyclone IV Chubby. On the road, my supplies go inside it. When I get to an airport, I empty it, fold the Brompton and put it inside. Surround it by whatever else will fit and check that in. The rest goes in the backpack for carry-on. Downside: excess baggage fees Radical Design makes other trailers. This person uses a child trailer with Brompton 

A Brompton uses a 16" wheel size, which means you could get a used Brompton wheel with Sturmey Archer 3-speed hub and swap it out. The only problem is that such wheels are rather expensive even used. 

You can cut an aluminum soda can into a small strip and wrap that around and fold it like a tiny burrito into the end. Crimp with pliers. 

A third (non-optimal) solution is if you are going to replace the wheel and hub anyway is to get a disc brake compatible rear hub and a rear disc-brake adapter.. 

Alternately, you could replace the tow-bar altogether by getting tubing of the same diameter and asking a local metalshop (autobody shop, metal sculpter) to bend it to the right angle and drill holes in the right places. Some homecenters also have tubing benders that they can let you use to bend the tubing (they have them for bending electrical conduits). Getting a new tow bar made is the most expensive and might overkill but is the strongest of the options. Hitch Mount: You could recycle your old hitch mount but they are a wear item and it'd be good to use the occasion to replace it. The parts for a new hitch mount are readily available. My trailers use a Sunlite style hitch:

Depends on the weight of the trailer and how hard it is to hook up. (Your link no longer shows what kind of trailer.) Look at the amount of weight pulled by single riders in the pictures here. Now that the link has been replaced by a photo, I would definitely think one bicycle is not enough. :-) 

After the damage done to my Brompton by StarPeru, and from the information in my previous question, I now have a Chubby. It protects the bike better than the B-bag, and my carry-on goes in it between flights. But the previously onerous task of finding the right flight price has become much worse, because I have to search each airline's website, and try to understand the convoluted baggage fee rules (if I can even find them) to get the real cost. Traveling Overseas with Bikes has some good information, but it cites a page that seems to contradict some of that information. It also seems to only be pertinent to Europe (I'm headed to Taiwan and Korea) and also to having a car to get the packaged bike to the airport. (I get to the airport on the bike, usually. Dumped the car seven years ago.) Looking at those two references and others, I get some messages that I should NOT tell them it's a bike and some saying that telling them is protection (which it certainly wasn't in Peru). Any actual experience here taking something like the Chubby on a plane? Especially interested in other than Europe. Saving a hundred whatevers on the ticket is no good if I spend two hundred on the bike. Saving two hundred on the bike is no good if I spend five hundred for repairs.¹ ¹Last trip, an iPad was stolen, and only then did I find that the insurance had a three hundred dollar limit. 

This would only make sense if you were replacing the wheel and brakes anyway. Normally discs on the rear are pretty senseless because most of the braking is from the front, but it might be the easiest, cheapest, and most powerful solution here -- if you're already replacing the wheel. 

The horizontal marks on the rivets that you think are screw heads are just an artifact of the older riveting process. You'd take them out using a standard chain breaker. Newer chains tend to use a different process to join chains together so that mark isn't visible anymore. 

This is a sign of an unbalanced pack. One of the cells is weak and under load its internal resistance is increasing and voltage decreasing. Normally this only happens with an old, worn out pack that hasn’t been balanced or has mismatched cells. If your pack is new, I’d get it replaced ASAP under warranty.
