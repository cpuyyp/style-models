It's impossible to say. There's not really any clear "right" or "wrong" here. You're unhappy with your job and concerned about the company's future prospects. That's as valid a reason to seek other opportunities as any. And you're at a startup, and concerned over the potential impact your departure will have. That's a normal reaction to this kind of situation. So there's two competing influences, neither of which is unreasonable. At the end of the day, you just have to make your own decisions based upon your own thoughts, feelings, and sense of ethics. It's not wrong to leave or right to stay, or vice versa. Each approach has its own pros and cons, risks and rewards. You need to weigh those up, and choose what is right for you. I'd suggest that you not place too much weight upon the indirect impact your decision may have upon the future of the startup or your colleagues, but I certainly can't say it would be wrong of you to do so. 

With that in mind, the best option would have been to sort this out before you took more leave than you had actually accrued. Many companies will be accommodating of such requests (though results will vary by locale and industry), provided that you're not trying to take more leave than you'll accrue in a single year in advance. Since it's too late for that, it sounds like your present options are: 

This is an important consideration. What rational reason is there to work for a company if you cannot convince yourself that it will succeed? If you don't believe the business can succeed, the thing to consider is this: Would you rather start looking for a different job now, or wait until you have no other choice? At some startups, the founders will be quite transparent about the operational status of the business, giving you visibility into things like how much cash is on hand, what the burn rate is, how long the company can keep operating without additional revenue, and how likely it is that they will find that additional revenue in the near future. However, I'm not really hearing that you've been given that sort of visibility. I've been with startups where the founders themselves advised everyone to start applying for other jobs because there was only a couple months of cash left and few prospects for finding more. And I've been with startups where the founders kept everyone in the dark about the actual state of the business, to the point of telling employees that the company had "plenty of cash" right up until the day they shut down the business. I don't know your exact position, but it sounds like you may be more in the latter situation than you are in the former. So if nothing else, be wary. 

Try to swim. Everyone ends up in the deep end sooner or later. The successful people rise to the challenge and learn to swim. There are resources available to help you: 

Absolutely not. Having screened more than a few resumes, I'll try to give you some insight into the perspective of the people who have to sift through dozens (if not hundreds) of resumes and decide who's actually worth interviewing. The things I care about are (in no particular order): 

You should never plan on just interviewing with one company. If you're serious about leaving (and I personally think you should be; 10 days of combined sick/holiday time after 3 years is ridiculous) then you need to get serious about leaving. You interview with as many as you need to, until you find one that is a good fit. 

Australian employment law doesn't allow employers to unilaterally vary the terms of employment for their employees. The variation needs to be agreed to by each employee the change applies to. The functioning of leave isn't something that employers are generally permitted to vary, in any case. If the general pool of leave accrues 20 days/year instead of 30 days/year, then the policy is basically shortchanging on leave entitlements. If leave days are treated generally, employees who don't get sick often may take longer holidays and resignations/terminations may cost more in terms of paying out accrued entitlements (normally only annual leave is paid out when employment ends; but if you have everything in a single pool you'll have to pay out the whole thing). 

You take pride in your work and are sorry that you made a mistake, and it will not happen again. You are willing to put in some extra time or accept whatever appropriate and relevant disciplinary action is fair to make up for your mistake (verbal/written warning, reduced bonus, paycut, etc.; though honestly in this case I think a stern warning is all that's called for). The headphones had nothing to do with the mistake that was made, and not having music is detrimental to your productivity as a programmer. The directive about the headphones is neither appropriate nor relevant, and you have no desire to be treated like a child by your employer. 

Those are valid concerns with any business. So it brings up another question: What would you do if the company was not a startup but everything else was still the same? If you'd not stay with a larger company that had these issues, there's no reason to stay with a smaller one. It's normal to feel a degree of responsibility for a startup's outcome. But when the founder of a startup acts as you describe, makes bad business decisions, and ignores the advice of other stakeholders, whatever happens is entirely on them. There's likely nothing you can do to change the outcome, no matter how much you may want to. 

The company name isn't something that can be made "confidential" in the official/binding sense. It's recorded in public records, and any applicant for the position will learn the actual company name as a matter of course. So I think what you mean is that the company name is "not listed as part of the job posting" rather than "confidential". So it's likely that if you were to submit an inquiry asking to know what company you'd actually be working for if you were to get this position, they'd simply tell you. You could set up a free e-mail account using just your initials (or a pseudonym, if you really want to take it to extremes; or a pseudonym and do the whole process using Tor, for the truly paranoid), and submit something along the lines of: 

Adjusting to a new process takes time, and it's not clear that you've really given Scrum a fair chance yet. Your previous process of only reporting to your direct manager, while potentially more convenient to you personally, is actually fairly inefficient from an organizational perspective. Nobody knows about what you're doing unless they hear it from your manager. That's a barrier to collaboration, is burdensome for your manager (especially if they have to do the same thing with every other employee they manage), and can lead to inefficiencies in terms of removing any blocking issues that you might encounter (because you're basically playing telephone with the person who can actually fix the issue, using your manager as an intermediary). I'd suggest that Scrum does have strong benefits as compared to your previous process, even if you're not personally seeing them yet. 

Option #1 is easy, since it basically requires doing nothing and has no negative consequences apart from the obvious short-term financial ones. However, as long as you are polite about things, and apologetic for not discussing the issue before you took the time off, I doubt there'd be any negative consequences to pursuing option #2. All you need to do is point out that you were under the impression that the balance would be taken from your future leave accrual and not deducted from your wages, and ask if they can switch to doing it that way. Just be prepared for them to say 'no', and ready to drop the issue if they do. If they say 'no' and you continue to press the issue, then you might run into negative consequences. Caveat Emptor I have no specific knowledge of social or workplace customs in Singapore. It's possible (though in my view, unlikely) that asking for this sort of thing would violate some local taboo. In which case there may be negative consequences. If you feel that this is the sort of thing that's "just not talked about" where you are, then the safest option is not to talk about it. 

If you'd rather not spend time applying for a position that you feel confident you will not be offered, then don't. If, on the other hand, you'd rather get a bit of a learning experience out of doing the interview, then go for it. They invited you, after all. I've done the same thing myself once or twice, and it's not always the case that you don't get offered a job at the end. So you might end up with a pleasant surprise. Or at worst you'll gain a bit of experience at interviewing for senior-level positions. One day you'll probably need that. 

Your friend's company has bigger problems than damage control, and its bruises were not caused by the salary disclosures. The situation that you've described implies some deep operational issues, and the path towards picking up the pieces involves addressing them. For instance: 

There's nothing wrong with saying "I need more time" if that's what you need. It's perfectly acceptable to say "thank you for the offer, I need to take some time to think it over and discuss it with my significant other, and I'll let you know what I decide as soon as possible". Perfectly acceptable, and certainly less complicated than accepting the offer and then changing your mind a short time later. And it can also help from a negotiation standpoint if you make it clear that you've got another offer that you're considering. That said, yes, you're fully entitled to accept the second offer (regardless of your background check status, and generally regardless of any employment contract you might sign; unless you sign one with a particularly harsh non-compete clause in it, though harsh non-compete clauses are often not enforceable). And yes, it will likely be fairly awkward dealing with the first company. 

Anything from high school or earlier I'm not interested in (unless a high school diploma is the highest credential that you have). It doesn't matter if you joined Mensa when you were six, that's not going to get you in ahead of anybody else. I'm looking for people who sound like they can fill a specific role. If you want to get my attention, give me things that make it clear that you understand the role and would be a good choice for it. Customizing your resume and/or cover letter for the position you're applying for will help get you ahead of the pack. I won't reject your submission outright if you hand me a 6-page essay filled with things that I don't consider relevant. Or for being poorly organized, poorly formatted, or otherwise difficult to get across in 5 minutes or less. Some other interviewers are less forgiving, however. And the more noise you give me, the more difficult it is for me to pick up the signal. So the 'ideal format' in almost all cases is keep your resume short and focused to the role you're applying for. You generally do not need more than 2 pages. Give me a high level overview, grouped sensibly (i.e. a brief summary of your skills and qualifications, a section for "Education", a section for "Work Experience", and so on) and against each item list a small number of achievements relevant to the position you're applying to. Avoid going into the distant past (awards won in elementary school, for instance) unless you're having trouble filling even a single page.
