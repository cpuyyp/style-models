Ogre Battle March of the Black Queen is a game (SNES and later re-released on Playstation) which used Tarot cards as a sort of clutch summoning system. A limited resource to help your armies edge past difficult opponents. Each card's effect was loosely tied to the card itself; for example the magician card did an effect of magical fire damage on the enemy army, the Empress card would heal your army. You obtained cards by liberating cities. Everytime you liberated a city you could draw a card; and the chosen card also gave a permanent stat change to the army that drew it. Some like hanged-man or devil gave negative effects. So it was a bit of a gamble. 

I think the best way to utilize the "subtle" approach would be to have characters inform the actions of the staff by way of verbal comments, RP, or desires. In some ways (where feasible, it can't be too flashy after all) when a character wielding the staff expresses a verbal interest in something, the staff can start to shift reality toward that end. After a while characters may start to see a cause and effect. Example: A caster wielding the staff says something like, "If only I'd prepared an extra casting of fireball today instead of conjure bread." You can just retcon the spell slots. A perhap better example: "Man I'm pretty weak right now I really hope I make this save against poison." They roll you have the staff provide a circumstance bonus (in secret) to their roll. 

Since you're giving me "in a (slightly) less-realistic world?" to work with I feel like a couple of potential options present themselves. For starters it's possible that an entire form of martial arts has been developed around the use of the scythe (and possibly other farming implements) as a means of dealing with frequent raids or attacks in a largely agricultural nation. As such no extra weapons are required citizens don't have to "beat swords back to plowshares" they can literally just keep using the same tools for farming and combat. The other would be something you mention about the blade shifting back and forth. Simple spring loaded locks near the handle could allow the blade to snap into a combat scythe shape at the push of a trigger. This would take it from farm mode to war mode in an instant; and then properly trained peasants can form something like pike men lines to stop cavalry or the like. 

@AlonzoMuncy mentions galvanization in the comments, which was my first thought on this topic: Galvanization is the process of applying a "coat" of zinc to iron/steel in order to prevent rust. There are several methods for this process. So technically it's not an Alloy, but galvanized steel is very common in application. More to the point Galvanized steel/iron is typically used in outdoor areas and doesn't generally serve a structural purpose (other then to hold up things like signs or lights). The most common galvanized objects most people would encounter are street sign posts, traffic light poles, and street lights. In more rural settings things like chain-link fencing and fence posts are also galvanized. So a lot of the common infrastructure listed above would need a new form of rust-resistance or to be replaced by new materials entirely. 

I don't think under water vents are that far off from being a possibility. Underwater vents can reach temperatures of over 800 째F putting them in the range of melting lead. While difficult to imagine, a completely closed crucible melting metal contained in the top of the crucible which is then pulled by gravity down into a crude mold of knife/spear head shapes may be possible with lava which can reach temperatures around 700 to 1,200 째C (1,292 to 2,192 째F). Depending on the temperatures just below the vents it may be possible to get into more structural metals like bronze or copper in this way. This of course requires active volcanoes either near the ocean (like the Hawaiian islands or oceanic vents/volcanoes). Another possibility would be electrolysis; some of the magnesium produced in the world today is obtained from sea water and an electrolytic process. If chemistry is something your aquatic races gets pretty good at its possible that they could "forge" items from carefully chosen templates using electrolysis to coat the template with the desired material (for example a piece of stone or bone electro plated with magnesium) Just the electrolysis of magnesium alone may be enough to produce forge level temperatures since magnesium can burn at over 5000 째F. Your aquatic creatures would likely need to be using techniques and tools that we don't have analogs too based on the environmental differences but I do think there is the possibility that they could effectively work with metals. 

I'll start off by saying I'm not a physicist; that said what about the possibility of large natural deposits of highly radioactive elements either dissolved into the water or just jutting out of the sea floor? Uranium and other long lived isotopes may provide a wide area heating mechanism to open up a polar sea. Its likely the surface wouldn't show readings of this radiation either (water absorbs a lot of radiation) and the sea would have some convection type currents. Radiation heats deep water which rises and replaces colder surface water, etc. If the natural deposits don't work for whatever reason, perhaps the radioactive elements were deposited via planetary bombardment. Large radioactive asteroids bombarded the planet creating several "radio springs" that create liquid water pools in a polar region. 

Perhaps a biological adaptation or mutation that causes skin to act like a Non-Newtonian fluid? These are structures that are fluid or free to move normally but sharp impacts cause the surface to harden as the molecules bind under the force of the impacting object. Silly putty is one example as is D3o 

In the odd occurrence of needing to remind the land lubbers that the sea is always a threat, I would suggest taming specific land creatures. Notably the ones that don't mind hanging out near/in water. Walrus - Slow but powerful Seals - Fairly fast, although probably not mountable, more like guard dogs Bears - I'm thinking polar bears mostly, but any bears near a coastline should work. Domesticate with meals of fish. Now you have a powerful land based mount.
