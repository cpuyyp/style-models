See picture attached of a point in the rear derallier cable routing - should I put something in there to prevent rubbing (I can't fit any brake or gear housing in there - so if so what should I use?), or is the cable fine going naked through the braze-on? Ditto for the other side and the front derallier, which goes through a series of curves and up into the derallier. Thanks 

First thing to do would be to get some data about your max power outputs over different gradients & conditions. So you'll want to know what you can sustain over a 10% 3 km climb, or a 10k climb at 5%. You'll also need to know how this fits into different length rides - you'll be able to output a higher average over 15 km than you would over 30 km. The relationship between power, gradient, cadence, gear and speed is complex. Increasing power will cause your cadence to rise, thus speeding you up. The steeper the gradient, the more resistance there will be, so it'll take more power to remain at a steady cadence (in the same gear). Dividing your power by your weight will give you a watts/kg rating which is useful. Once you know all this data, you'll be able to look at a hill and know that, all else being equal, you'll give your best performance if you maintain, say, 4 w/kg for the climb. You can then use your powermeter output to adjust your effort accordingly. Edit: Mind you, if I understand the event description correctly, I suspect that over that sort of distance you are best off just pushing on the pedals as hard as you can. 

If you have carbon rims (with a carbon braking surface) you will need appropriate brake pads, so as not to damage the rims. You do not have to use shimano brake shoes- most (possibly all?) rim brakes will take any brand of shoes. There is a carbon rim insert for Dura Ace, which might fit the ultegra shoes. However if there are no compatible pads for your brake shoes/ rims, you may have to buy a new set of shoes - not especially pricy, and they will come with pads. 

I'm trying to work out if my current brakes are long enough to work with 700C wheels (ie 622mm rim), rather than 630 (27"). The question I have is, will the wheel sit at the same point in the dropout? Do I need to factor in a different diameter quick release bolt? Or do they have the same diamater? Will the frame spread make a difference? Thanks Tom 

I'm just about to buy a new bike. It comes with Shimano R501 wheels, which are rather lightly spoked (20 front, 24 rear). I weigh about 230lbs (I'm 6'6") - do you think it'll be worth getting a better pair of wheels with more spokes? Or will I be well within the tolerance levels for the wheels? Thanks 

I have a feeling that this has been covered many times! But here's a detailed paper about carbon fibre compared to other materials: $URL$ 

I've got a 2 month old Cannondale Evo Supersix. When I take it over a rough patch of road (far too many of these in Wiltshire!) there is a loud noise coming from the forks - it's obviously caused by the vibrations, but it sounds really unhealthy! Edit: The noise is like a loud.. chattering I guess. Not chattering in the braking sense though - it happens no matter what braking activity is going on. It's a bit hollow sounding. What might be causing this? And is there any way of preventing it? Thanks 

I think it's pretty situational - there are so many things that you might do with said bike. Some basic tools for maintaining the bike would be helpful. Some suggestions, in no particular order: 

The pressure dial doesn't measure the pressure in the tube - it gives the pressure in the entire system (tube + hose). When you connect your pump, you need to pressurize the hose to the same level as the tube before it will read anything. I usually find this takes two or three full pumps, and the resistance jumps up massively once the tube and tire have the same pressure. At that point, the dial will show you the pressure in your tire. 

1) It's hard to say what's normal - what sort of riding have you been doing on it, as in, have you been going over a lot of curbs and potholes? The more you bounce on it, the more strain it'll have. Have you hit one particular pothole hard recently? How heavy are you? The heavier you are, the more likely you are to damage the wheel. 2) You should take it to your LBS, they'll be able to tell you the answer to this, but most likely they'll be able to repair it and re-true the wheel. 3) Depends on who you got it from.. and what warrantee you have I guess. Probably going to be a general wear though I'd suspect. 

I know that's three things, but really you cant have one without the others - puncture repair kits without a pump would still leave you rather immobile! 

The short answer is, unfortunatly, no. It used to be possible to fudge it - you could save your routes on the computer, and apply them as a layer on the phone, highlighting the roads. However, this functionality was removed a couple of years back. There are several groups calling for it to be reintroduced, so with some luck it'll be back as a feature one day! 

The more you weigh, the more power required to get to, and maintain a certain speed.. but at the same time, generally, the more power you can produce. On the flat you're mostly working against air resistance, a larger framed rider (less aerodynamic) will need more power to overcome the resistance than a smaller rider. Generally aerodynamics of rider & weight of rider will have a strong correlation. 30mph is not at all slow, if you were able to maintain that for 20 km you'd actually post reasonably competitive times in a pro TT! A better groupset might save weight (although that's more important with climbing & accelerating), it might also give you a better selection of gears & better power transfer. A carbon bike might be more aerodynamic.
