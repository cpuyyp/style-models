Consider $PSU(2)$, the three-dimensional projective special unitary group (or just $\mathbb{R}\mathbb{P}^3$). It is a Lie group, and therefore orientable. Yet, it is the quotient of the simply-connected group $SU(2)$ by its center $\mathbb{Z}_2$, so it has 2-torsion in homology. 

Assume that $G$ is connected and simply-connected. From the principal $G_a$-bundle $G_a\rightarrow G\rightarrow G/G_a=\mathcal{O}_a$, we obtain a long-exact sequence $$\ldots\rightarrow\pi_i(G_a)\rightarrow\pi_i(G)\rightarrow\pi_i(\mathcal{O}_a)\rightarrow\pi_{i-1}(G_a)\rightarrow\ldots.$$ Since $\pi_1(G)=0$ and $\pi_2(G)=0$, exactness considerations imply that $\pi_1(G_a)=\pi_2(\mathcal{O}_a)$. Often, orbits $\mathcal{O}_a$ are partial flag varieties of $G_{\mathbb{C}}$, and their second homotopy groups are reasonably well-known. I am not sure if this helps. 

There are holomorphic line bundles over a compact Riemann surface $X$ that are topologically trivial, yet not holomorphically trivial. To see this, note that smooth complex line bundles are classified by a complete invariant, called the degree. By contrast, we have the Picard group $Pic(X)$ of isomorphism classes of holomorphic line bundles on $X$. One always has a surjective group morphism $Pic(X)\rightarrow\mathbb{Z}$, defined by taking degrees of holomorphic line bundles. In general (ie. for positive genus), this map is not an isomorphism. Its kernel therefore contains smoothly (hence topologically) trivial complex line bundles that are not holomorphically trivial. 

I believe that the answer is yes. First note that the complexification $G_{\mathbb{C}}$ of $G$ is reductive and contains $G$ as a maximal compact subgroup. Secondly, $G_{\mathbb{C}}$ acts algebraically on $M$ via an extension of the original $G$-action. Your symplectic quotient is then homeomorphic to the projective Geometric Invariant Theory quotient of $M$ by $G_{\mathbb{C}}$. A useful reference is Chapter 8 of Kirwan's thesis, Cohomology of Quotients in Symplectic and Algebraic Geometry. 

You might consider your problem in a generalized setting. Let $H$ be a Lie group and $X$ an $H$-manifold on which $H$ acts freely and properly. There is a unique manifold structure on $X/H$ for which $X\rightarrow X/H$ is a principal $H$-bundle (and in particular, a fiber bundle). If $H$ is a closed subgroup of a Lie group $G$, then $H$ acts freely and properly on $G$ by left-multiplication. You then obtain the desired result. I have never before attempted to construct explicit local cross-sections. You might try to use the exponential map $\exp:\frak{g}\rightarrow $G$ $ (a local diffeomorphism) together with your surjection $\frak{g}\rightarrow\frak{g}/\frak{h}$ to construct a local section at the identity. Otherwise, I think you might need to consider the Implicit Function Theorem (not particularly explicit). 

Let $G$ be a Lie group and $H\subseteq G$ a closed subgroup. The quotient map $G\rightarrow G/H$ is a principal $H$-bundle. In particular, it is an example of a fibration. We then have an associated long-exact sequence of homotopy groups, $$\ldots\rightarrow\pi_n(H)\rightarrow\pi_n(G)\rightarrow\pi_n(G/H)\rightarrow\pi_{n-1}(H)\rightarrow\ldots.$$ So, if you have information about the homotopy groups of $G$ and $H$, you might be able to obtain information about those of $G/H$ using this sequence. 

In what categories is it reasonable to compare these versions of the affine Grassmannian? In these categories, are the two versions isomorphic? 

Let $G$ be a real algebraic group, and let $X$ be a real affine $G$-variety. I am looking for conditions on $G$ and $X$ for which the $G$-orbits are known to be locally closed in the Zariski topology on $X$. Please feel free to offer any conditions you desire. References would also be much appreciated. Of particular interest to me is the case in which $G$ is semisimple and $X$ is a finite-dimensional $G$-representation. Over $\mathbb{C}$, one usually establishes that orbits are locally closed by appealing to Chevalley's Theorem. It tells us that the an orbit contains a non-empty open subset of its closure. If we act on this open set by elements of $G$, then we realize the orbit as being open in its closure. Unfortunately, I believe Chevalley's Theorem fails over non-algebraically closed fields. ADDED: I would be perfectly happy with conditions under which a $G$-orbit is the unique orbit of maximal dimension in its Zariski closure. This is weaker than being locally closed. 

Suppose that I have a complex projective variety $X$ endowed with an algebraic action of a complex torus $T$. Suppose also that the set $X^T$ of fixed points is finite. I would like to relate the equivariant cohomologies $H_{T}(X;\mathbb{C})$ and $H_{T}(X^T;\mathbb{C})$ using the existing localization theory. Yet, I am finding it difficult to verify some of the hypotheses conventionally imposed in the main theorems (ex. that $H_T(X;\mathbb{C})$ is a free module over $H_{T}(*;\mathbb{C})$) for the examples I am considering. What are some of the most general conclusions that follow in the situation described above, and what sorts of things should I investigate in order to relate the equivariant cohomologies? 

@Alex Degtyarev's comment gives the right idea. The tangent bundle of $SU(2)$ can be given a left-trivialization, which will identify it with $SU(2)\times\mathfrak{su}_2$. In this way, you can think of $\mathfrak{su}(2)$ as the Lie algebra of all left-invariant vector fields on $SU(2)$. The Lie bracket of two such vector fields is the left-invariant vector field coming from the bracket of the corresponding vectors in $\mathfrak{su}(2)$. However, this Lie algebra is non-abelian, meaning that the bracket of two vectors in $\mathfrak{su}_2$ may not vanish. Note that a connected Lie group is abelian if and only if it's Lie algebra is abelian (as the image of the exponential map generates the identity component). The fact that $SU(2)$ is non-abelian is then reflected in the fact that $\mathfrak{su}_2$ is a non-abelian Lie algebra. 

I would encourage you to consider "Representation Theory and Complex Geometry" by Chriss and Ginzburg. In particular, I think you might enjoy the realization of irreducible representations of the Weyl group of a complex semisimple group $G$ on the Borel-Moore homology of the fibres of the Springer resolution of the nilpotent cone. For me, this has always been one of the motivating examples in geometric representation theory. 

Suppose that $X$ and $Y$ are smooth complex algebraic varieties, and that $f:X\rightarrow Y$ is an etale morphism in the sense that $d_xf:T_xX\rightarrow T_{f(x)}Y$ is an isomorphism for all $x\in X$. Must $f$ be (at least locally) an open immersion? Certainly, difficulties can arise if the differential fails to be an isomorphism at a single point. Consider the map $\mathbb{A}^1\rightarrow\mathbb{A}^1$, $z\mapsto z^2$. 

I am interested in references and suggestions concerning the use of stratifications in topology to inductively compute topological invariants. I would appreciate a fairly introductory reference on the subject matter. Also, my stratification consists of orbits of an action of a connected, simply-connected complex semisimple Lie group, so I would also appreciate references and suggestions relevant to my situation. Thanks! 

Let $T$ be a complex torus and $X$ a smooth quasi-projective $T$-variety with finitely many fixed points. Denote by $\varphi:H_{T}(X)\rightarrow H_{T}(X^T)$ the map on equivariant cohomology induced by the inclusion $X^T\hookrightarrow X$ of the fixed points. If $X$ were compact, then we could explicitly describe $\varphi$ by computing the weights of the isotropy representations on the tangent spaces to fixed points. Still, I am wondering about what can be said if one does not assume $X$ to be compact. In particular, should one invoke essentially the same procedure to describe $\varphi$? I would appreciate references and/or suggestions. 

I believe the answer is yes. There are perhaps several ways to see this, but a decent reference is the book "Affine Flag Manifolds and Principal Bundles" by Schmitt. It contains an article called "Quantization of Hitchinâ€™s Integrable System and the Geometric Langlands Conjecture" by T.L. Gomez. Your answer can be found near the beginning of Section 4.1. 

Let $G$ be a connected, simply-connected complex semisimple linear algebraic group with Lie algebra $\frak{g}$. Fix a maximal torus $T\subseteq G$ and let $\Delta\subseteq Hom(T,\mathbb{C}^*)$ be the resulting collection of roots. Choose positive and negative roots, $\Delta_{+}$ and $\Delta_{-}$, respectively. Let $\Pi\subseteq\Delta_{+}$ be the set of simple roots. Let $V(\lambda)$ be the irrep of $G$ with highest (dominant) weight $\lambda$. We know that $$V(\lambda)=U(\frak{n}_-) v_{\lambda},$$ where $v_{\lambda}\in V(\lambda)$ is a high-weight vector. Is there some characterization of those $\alpha\in\Delta_{-}$ for which $\{0\}=\frak{g}_{\alpha}\cdot v_{\lambda}$? (ie. Which negative root spaces annihilate $v_{\lambda}$?) I think we might generally obtain more than just those $\alpha\in\Delta_{-}$ for which $\lambda+\alpha$ is not a weight of $V(\lambda)$. If this is documented in the literature, I would appreciate any references. If not, I would appreciate any thoughts. 

Consider the conjugation representation of $GL_n$ on $M_n$. Suppose that $A$ is an $n\times n$ matrix. Then $C(A)$ is the $\mathfrak{gl}_n$-stabilizer of $A$, so that $\dim(C(A))$ is equal to the dimension of the $GL_n$-stabilizer of $A$. In other words, $\dim(C(A))$ is $n^2$ minus the dimension of the conjugacy class of $A$. If $A$ is a nilpotent matrix in Jordan canonical form, then I believe there are expressions for the dimension of the conjugacy class of $A$ in terms of the partition giving its Jordan canonical form. You might find this in Nilpotent Orbits in Semisimple Lie Algebras by Collingwood and McGovern. 

As @abx has indicated, $\pi_2(G_{\mathbb{C}}/P)$ is isomorphic to $H_2(G_{\mathbb{C}}/P)$. To describe the latter group, we use the Bruhat decomposition of $G_{\mathbb{C}}/P$. Choose a maximal torus $T$ and Borel $B$ satisfying $T\subseteq B\subseteq P$. We then have the Bruhat decomposition $$G_{\mathbb{C}}/P=\coprod_{[w]\in W/W_P}BwP/P,$$ where $W_P$ is the subgroup of $W$ generated by the reflections for the simple roots whose negative root spaces belong to the Lie algebra of $P$. The dimension of the Bruhat cell indexed by a coset in $W/W_P$ is twice the length of the coset representative of minimal length. So, all cells are even-dimensional, and $H_2(G_{\mathbb{C}}/P)$ is the free abelian group of rank equal to the number of cosets in $W/W_P$ with minimal representatives of length $1$. So, this rank is equal to the number of simple roots whose negative root spaces are not in the Lie algebra of $P$. (If $P=B$, then this rank is precisely the number of simple roots.) I hope this is the sort of answer you are seeking. 

I suspect it will suffice to find a topology for whicg $ev_1$ is an open map. (In any reasonable topology, loop reparametrization should define a self-homeomorphism of $C^{\infty}(S^1,\mathbb{R}^n)$.) For a Lie group $G$, $$LG:=C^{\infty}(S^1,G)$$ is its loop group. We find that $$ev_1:LG\rightarrow G$$ is a surjective group morphism with kernel the based loop group $$\Omega G:=\{\gamma\in LG:\gamma(1)=e\}.$$ So, I think the trick is to find a topology on $LG$ for which $$LG\rightarrow G=LG/\Omega G$$ is a principal $\Omega G$-bundle. I believe this will render $$ev_1:LG\rightarrow G$$ an open map. For compact connected semisimple $G$, a standard reference on $LG$ and $\Omega G$ is Pressley-Segal. In this case, $ev_1$ should be a principal $\Omega G$-bundle. Some of the relevant constructions may also work for $G=\mathbb{R}^n$. 

Let $X$ and $Y$ be algebraic varieties over $\mathbb{C}$. I am repeatedly encountering references to crepant morphisms $f:X\rightarrow Y$. I have found several definitions of such a morphism, one of which is the condition that $f^*(K_Y)=K_X$. Is this generally accepted to be the meaning of a crepant morphism, or is this only the definition in some more restrictive context? Also, I would appreciate some perspective on why one naturally considers this class of morphisms. 

Let $\mathfrak{g}$ be a finite-dimensional complex semisimple Lie algebra, and let $\phi_1:\mathfrak{sl}_2(\mathbb{C})\rightarrow\mathfrak{g}$ and $\phi_{2}:\mathfrak{sl}_2(\mathbb{C})\rightarrow\mathfrak{g}$ be complex Lie algebra morphisms. By composing $\phi_1$ and $\phi_2$ with the adjoint representation of $\mathfrak{g}$, we obtain two representations of $\mathfrak{sl}_2(\mathbb{C})$ on $\mathfrak{g}$. My question is then the following. Question: If these two $\mathfrak{sl}_2(\mathbb{C})$-representations are isomorphic, does it follow that $\phi_1$ and $\phi_2$ are related by an element of the Lie algebra automorphism group $\text{Aut}(\mathfrak{g})$? To provide some context, suppose that $\mathfrak{g}=\mathfrak{so}_{4n}(\mathbb{C})$. If $\lambda$ is a partition of $4n$ having only even parts with each part appearing an even number of times, then $\lambda$ corresponds to exactly two distinct nilpotent orbits, $\mathcal{O}_1$ and $\mathcal{O}_2$, in $\mathfrak{so}_{4n}(\mathbb{C})$. Now, let $\phi_1:\mathfrak{sl}_2(\mathbb{C})\rightarrow\mathfrak{so}_{4n}(\mathbb{C})$ and $\phi_2:\mathfrak{sl}_2(\mathbb{C})\rightarrow\mathfrak{so}_{4n}(\mathbb{C})$ be Lie algebra maps satisfying $\phi_1(e)\in\mathcal{O}_1$ and $\phi_2(e)\in\mathcal{O}_2$. As discussed above, each map gives a representation of $\mathfrak{sl}_2(\mathbb{C})$ on $\mathfrak{so}_{4n}(\mathbb{C})$. These two representations are actually isomorphic. While $\phi_1$ and $\phi_2$ cannot be related by an inner automorphism of $\mathfrak{so}_{4n}(\mathbb{C})$ (as $\mathcal{O}_1\neq\mathcal{O}_2$), they are nevertheless related by a Lie algebra automorphism. 

Let $G$ be a connected, simply-connected, complex, semisimple Lie group. Suppose that $H$ is a Zariski-closed subgroup of $G$ with reductive Lie algebra $\frak{h}$. Under what conditions may one conclude that $H$ is a linearly reductive complex Lie group? I would appreciate any and all references and suggestions. Thanks! 

This is not true as stated. Let $n=1$ and consider $V(x_1^2)=\{0\}$. This subvariety is irreducible, but $x_1^2$ is reducible. 

I suspect that the answer you seek can be deduced from the Kostant Multiplicity Formula. It gives the multiplicity of a weight in an irreducible complex representation of a compact Lie group $G$. One reference would be: A Formula for the Multiplicity of a Weight, by Kostant. 

Let $G$ be a connected, simply-connected complex semisimple linear algebraic group, and let $V$ be a finite-dimensional complex $G$-module. Note that if $V$ is the adjoint representation of $G$, then nilpotent $G$-orbits are invariant under the scaling action of $\mathbb{C}^*$. For arbitrary $V$, is there some kind of description of $\mathbb{C}^*$-invariant $G$-orbits? Certainly, a necessary condition is that $0$ lie in the closure of such an orbit. 

Let $X$ be a smooth complex projective variety acted upon by algebraically by a complex torus $T$. Let $F_1,\ldots,F_n$ be the connected components of $X^T$ and assume that the restriction map $$H_T^*(X)\rightarrow H_T^*(X^T)=\bigoplus_{i=1}^nH_T^*(F_i)$$ is injective. (For me, all equivariant cohomology is over $\mathbb{Q}$.) For each $i$, let $N_i$ denote the normal bundle of $F_i$ in $X$, and let $e_T(N_i)\in H_T^*(F_i)$ denote its $T$-equivariant Euler class. $\textbf{Question}:$ Viewing $H_T^*(X)$ as a subalgebra of $\bigoplus_{i=1}^nH_T^*(F_i)$, when is $H_T^*(X)$ generated as an algebra by the equivariant Euler classes $e_T(F_i)$? 

It might help to consider a specific example. To this end, let $U=SU(2)$. Its complexification is $G=SL_2(\mathbb{C})$. Let us take $V$ to be the adjoint representation of $SL_2(\mathbb{C})$ on its Lie algebra $\frak{sl}_2(\mathbb{C})$. Set $v=e$, the usual nil-positive element of $\frak{sl}_2(\mathbb{C})$. The $SL_2(\mathbb{C})$-orbit of $e$ then consists of all $2\times 2$ nilpotent matrices except for $0$. In particular, $w=0$ lies in the boundary of $SL_2(\mathbb{C})\cdot e$. Note that $(\frak{su}_2)_0=\frak{su}_2$. Also, for all $X\in\frak{su}_2$, $Y\in\frak{sl}_2(\mathbb{C})$, and $t\in\mathbb{R}$, $$\exp(tX)\cdot Y=e^{ad_{tX}}(Y).$$ It is now difficult for me to imagine finding $Y\in SL_2(\mathbb{C})\cdot e$ and $X\in\frak{su}_2$ for which taking the limit $t\rightarrow\infty$ of both sides gives $0$. I hope this helps.
