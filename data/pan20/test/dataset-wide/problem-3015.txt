While chemical distiallation as a process was known since Aristotle's time in the Mediterranean world and Middle East, the process was not generallay applied to alcoholic beverages until much later. The earliest (sure) evidence of beverage distillation is in the 10th (North, Jin dynasty) to 12th century (Southern Song dynasty) China and 12 century Italy. Bench scale distillation of alcoholic beverages might have been practiced for private use by nobility and senior clergy (think monastery abbots), but these beverages would not have been available to other than privileged guests. They would also have been very rough compared to the liquors of today, as aging was not practiced until much later after industrial-scale distillation of beverages began in the 15th Century. Note that beverages produced strictly by fermentation are naturally limited to about 14% Alcohol By Volume (ABV) as the yeasts die of alcohol poisoning at that point. Wines are readily produced to that strength if the pressed juice contains sufficient sugar, but the final ABV is generally determined from the juice as it is near impossible to stop fermentation once it starts. Brewmasters control the sugar content more directly and readily brew to a variety of strengths. Beer during the Middle Ages was naturally produced in a wide range of alcohol concentrations, generally classed as strong beers of 8-14% ABV; medium beers of about 4-8% ABV, and weak beers of 1-3% ABV. The latter would have been the everyday drink of the common man and even children into the late 19th century, when water supply quality became reliable. It is important to note that Medieval beer was nearly always a spiced beer, not a hopped beer, as the flavour and preservation qualities of adding hops to beer was not commonly recognized until the 13th century, and even then spread slowly from Bavaria. (See also What actually happened with beer and Leeuwarden in 1487?) While these various strengths of beer would have been available from the tap in Medieval public houses, one would likely have watered one's own wine to taste after the bottle arrived, in consequence of the different fermentation constraint. 

Stationary ships (eg ... admirals extoll'd for standing still, Of doing nothing with a deal of skill) were used by the British fleet(s) off Ushant, Finisterre and elsewhere along the French Coast during the Napoleonic War, as part of the port blockade. However the practical gap was only about 10 nautical miles IIRC. This was only maintainable during good weather, as storms blew all the ships off their posts. Note that this required large numbers of expensive, sea-worthy ships (frigates and ships-of-the-line), well crewed and officered, and easily supplied by remaining close to ports with fresh water and food. Also, the messages that could be efficiently sent using signalling flags was quite limited. The straight-forward message England expects that every man will do his duty, sent by Nelson before Trafalgar, required 12 lifts and would have taken several minutes to send. Note that the flags of each lift must be raised, dropped, and of course left flying long enough to be read. A similar system was used by fleets searching for another, as by Nelson searching for Napoleon's fleet before the Battle of the Nile in 1800. A screen composed of all small ships of the fleet would be thrown forward in an inverted V, so that all vessels crossing the path of the screen would promptly be made known to Fleet Command. This task is what the flag system was primarily designed to accomplish. In the final analysis, one must ask what benefit would be accrued by the massive expense of a trans-Atlantic signalling fleet? It's size would have dwarfed even the Royal Navy of the 19th Century, and the messages capable of being sent more efficiently than by packet rather uncommon. What events, besides unfriendly Declarations of War occurring only a few times that century, could have even approached being of sufficient value? Update By my count the Royal navy employed 219 ships of the line and roughly an equal number of frigates during the span of the Napoleonic wars. With a distance of 3519 statute miles from Bristol to New York, a distance between stations of 10 statute miles on average, and an assumption that two ships would have been needed per station to allow adequate resupply, the entire Napoleonic era Royal Navy would have had insufficient ships (~700 required, ~450 available) to maintain such a telegraph, if it performed no other role. Clearly the astronomical cost of such a telegraph made in unfeasible to even consider implementing. Update #2 As for pigeons, the world record for a homing flight is from Arras, France, to Saigon, Vietnam in 24 days. A distance of ~7200 miles, that gives an average speed of 300 miles per day; exactly the same expectation as for a ship-of-the-line crossing the North Atlantic. Where pigeons had an advantage was over land rather than water, where daily travel distances were typically much less. 

The First Barbary War in 1805, immortalized in the line "to the shores of Tripoli" in the US Marines' Hymn, was fought to prevent: 

The German Empire in 1871 was nearly 2 1/2 times as large (in area) as Prussia alone had been 11 years earlier: According to Wikipedia the population of Prussia in 1871 was 24.6MM, and that of the entire German Empire was 40.0MM; note of course that the former includes all the territories conquered/coalesced in the preceding decade. The German Empire's vast reserves of coal and iron ore in the Rhineland as well as Silesia helped it to achieve a significant increase in urbanization in the years following 1861, rapidly increasing urbanization from 30% of population to over 65% in just 20 years. (I had that reference a moment ago and lost it - sigh.) All these factors combined to drive a significant increase in national wealth from Prussia alone in 1861, to the entire German Empire in 1881. So, to answer your question, the German Empire did not drive the economic and scientific success of the German population, but it did mean that a single autocratic government subsequently wielded the influence resulting from that success. Update: Note the German Empire generally (as well as Prussia specifically) entered the Industrial Revolution somewhat later than Britain, despite having significant geographic resources beneficial to that process. It is entirely expected that as the Industrial Revolution slowed in Britain the later starters would catch up. 

Yes, most certainly (though not always) - consider Market Garden in September 1944. Market was the airborne drop to take the cities and bridges, and Garden was the relief operation by British XXX Corps spear-headed by the Guards Armoured Division. The British had a penchant for two word operational names, and in this case the two names were easy to keep distinct in planner's minds, while not hinting at Arnhem directly. Another example is Operation Neptune as part of Overlord: the Normandy Invasion of June 1044. Surely the name of the Roman King Under the Sea is an apt name for the largest (or second largest, depending how you count Kublai's invasion of Japan) amphibious invasion in history, and Overlord seems also apt for the encompassing operation that included the airborne and logistics elements of the invasion as well. 

. Grant executed it masterfully, and achieved in only 6 weeks of early 1864 a situation that finally dispelled any illusion that the Army of Virginia had strategic options. 

A modern IT department typically requires its junior members to perform more on-call off-hour shifts than senior members, because the senior members need the face time with other departments that work regular shifts. Although the work performed by the Topographical office may not have been time critical, the time of arriving couriers most certainly would have been - most would be expected to depart again the next morning for their headquarters, with dispatches or orders of some sort. Having the office open through the night, manned by a junior officer, was the only way to provide an "on-call" service in an age before telephones, pagers, and cell phones. It seems likely that Carnot arranged for junior officers to work half-time on and half-time off, enabling couriers to deliver their dispatches promptly on arrival in Paris, and for those junior officers manning the off-hour shifts to still learn the trade. 

Subsequently at the Potsdam Conference of July & August 1945 the Borders of Poland and Russia were amended and announced in the conference proceedings as: 

This Wikipedia article (in French) lists the annual salary in francs of several employees of Jacques Augustin Catherine Pajou in 1828, after his death, probably close enough to OP's time frame to be adequate: 

A more likely possibility than General Colbert is King William IV with his (much younger) wife Adelaide. They married in July 1818. Even after his ascension in 1830 William was known to walk around London and Brighton unaccompanied by guards , as here. However the issue of the sash being worn on the wrong shoulder occurs again, and whether he was in the habit of making these walks in military dress I cannot determine. Update: It is worth noting that the facial features as painted much more closely resemble William IV than General Colbert, who appears to have retained his slim facial features until his death. In the British Army of this time (early to mid-nineteenth century) the red sash was simply an emblem of rank, with sergeants wearing it over one shoulder and officers over the other. However the references I have found to "the knot" placement seem to be opposite to how William IV is wearing it in his official portrait here (as I presume the monarch's rank is not sergeant). 

In The Jury and the English Law of Homicide, 1200-1600 T. A. Green outlines much of the history of modern British legal jurisprudence for murder. In summary: 

To my surprise, this may be somewhat accurate. In the critical Battle of Sedan on May 13, Guderian fielded 1st and 2nd Panzer divisions, reinforced by Grossdeutchland infantry regiment, one regiment of assault engineers, and divisional artillery from two panzer divisions. To compensate for the absence of his artillery reserve, still in transit to the front, Guderian requested and received approval for maximum air support from the Luftwaffe for the entire day. The main panzer and infantry forces spent the bulk of the day clearing bridges over the Meuse and the slopes overlooking them, assisted by the artillery; a significant victory. However the lone regiment of assault engineers, behind over 4,000 carpet- and dive-bombing sorties by the Luftwaffe, advanced 8 km against the defending French division, routing both it and the French artillery reserve behind it, for only minor casualties. This cleared the way for a virtually unlimited advance by the Panzer divisions in the following days, creating a decisive victory. However, it is important to note that: 

According to this syllabary of Sumerian, and just how one wishes to pronounce Bad-Tibira, one possible Sumerian transcription is this: 

Jerusalem being the capital of a province of his empire, that he passed by at least twice going to and returning from Egypt, it seems most unlikely that Alexander didn't visit Jerusalem. He apparently went out of his way to visit the Siwa Oasis (where his god-hood was confirmed) after founding Alexandria. Chapter Eight of Volume XI of Josephus describes the entry of Alexander into Jerusalem in somewhat fantastic terms, but there doesn't seem an obvious reason why this would be manufactured. 

The lion rampant with forked tail is a traditional emblem of Bohemia, now the Czech Republic, first evidenced on the seal of King Vladislaus II of Bohemia granted by Emperor Frederick Barbarossa in the mid to late 13th century. The forked nature of the tail is not meant to represent a mythical or unusual creature; rather it is to represent a moving tail, or a wagging tail if you will. 

The story of Scherazade and The 1001 Tales of the Arabian Nights is the classic example of the captivating quality of a serial. Doomed to marry the Sultan one day, and be executed the next as punishment for his first wife's adultery, Scherazade concocts the most brilliant scheme to survive. In (presumably) the afterglow of being deflowered, Scherazade begins to relate a wondrous tale to the Sultan, but falls asleep at the cliff-hanger before she can finish it. Desperate to hear the end of the tale, the Sultan grants a stay on the execution for a single night so that the story can be completed. Scherazade manages to wind that into a second story that again she cannot finish before falling asleep, leaving the Sultan desperate to hear the ending. This goes on for 1001 nights, Scherazade each night so entrancing the Sultan with the bewitching nature of the tales she relates, and the cliff-hangers that she is able to endlessly concoct. Finally, after nearly 3 years, the one thousand and one nights of the title, the Sultan relents and permanently revokes the death sentence. This tale is precisely the classic notion of an endless serial, which serialized novels simply attempt to instantiate in a different medium. OP asks for the origin of the marketing concept of publishing a serialized story; a set of novels on a single storyline that will captivate the reader and entice additional sales because the reader simply must find out how the story ends. The earliest origin of that concept I believe to be not the 1001 tales themselves, but the backstory behind them - the story of Scherazade, and the 1001 Tales of the Arabian Nights. 

First imagine a world without any coinage, where all purchases and sales must be achieved through barter. Further imagine that there are well accepted equivalencies, between all goods so that an average ox is understood to be worth 10 average sheep, 8 average goats, etc. Three of those goods will of course be copper, silver and gold, so that there will be well understood equivalencies between not only those three precious metals, but also between each of those and every other good. For instance, an average sheep might be worth 0.5 oz of silver. To this world we now add well-estimated coinage, with each dime being 0.5 oz of silver and each penny being 0.5 oz of copper, with 1 dime = 12 pennies. In this economy a sheep costs 1 dime, or 12 pennies. Now the economy runs with much less friction not only because coins are much easier to carry, but also because sales transactions can be made without requiring an exact match of need and supply between seller and buyer. Now imagine that a cash-strapped monarch decides to debase the coinage by minting a debased dime containing only 0.25 oz of silver. Since a sheep is still worth 0.5 oz of silver, a sheep farmer will only sell a sheep for 2 of these debased dimes, or for one of the original good dimes. (In effect this debased dime is a nickel, but it is still nominally denominated as a dime.) Now the price of every non-specie good has suddenly doubled when denominated in the new debased dimes. That is inflation. The reason David Graber states is that historically, the quantity of silver and copper mined each year less that withdrawn from circulation for jewellery and other consumer goods was insufficient to match the growth of the economy. (Gold is largely irrelevant, as only states and very wealth individuals traded in gold, but the same statement holds true.) With the precious metals from which coins were minted becoming scarcer (relative to the size of the economy) each year, the demand for these metals and their respective coins increased, meaning that other goods traded for a lesser quantity of the same coin each year. That is deflation. There were exceptions to the above, the most notable being as a result of the huge quantity of silver brought to Europe in the 16th and 17th centuries by the Spanish. There was a substantial inflation during this period. There was also a dramatic increase in economic activity due to the historically very unusual adequacy of circulating currency.
