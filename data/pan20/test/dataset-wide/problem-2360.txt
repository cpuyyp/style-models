Alternatively, you can descend with a rope bucket dangling off the haul loop of your harness. Stuff the rope in the bucket starting from the ends, and descend as normal, taking the rope out of the bucket as you go. I'll sometimes descend this way using my rope bag as a rope bucket, you can also use a backpack suspended by it's haul loop. 

Size and Depth Small lakes with beaches are the best to play in, they're calm, warm, and very tame. You can pretty much treat such lakes as swimming pools. Larger lakes are where you need to be careful. Bigger lakes are deeper, have bigger wave potential, and can experience more severe weather. When swimming in a big lake, you can stay close to the shore, or choose to wander out into the middle/try to cross the lake. The difference is you can't just get out of the pool if you get tired, get a cramp, or inhale a mouthful of water. If you're out in the middle of a lake, no one is going to come to your rescue, so it would be good for you to learn how do preform a survival float, or drown proofing. Temperature Hypothermia is a real danger when swimming outdoors. Lots of lake swimmers such as triathletes swim in special wetsuits that have great mobility for swimming. Depending on where you are you can find lots of lakes that are warm enough to swim in for long periods of time without getting too cold, and what the temperature is outside with the sun will have an effect on the water as well, but being in the water long enough, especially while moving through the water will slowly cool your core. If you start to get hypothermia in a large open lake, then you're in trouble if you can't get back to shore quick. There is also cold shock, if you've never experienced swimming in icy waters, cold shock can be a killer, I've seen lots of kids dive into cold water for the first time where I'm from and come up choked for air, frantically flailing their arms, and stumbling to get back out of the water. If you're not prepared for it, and don't have experience with it, cold shock can shut your respiratory system down and really make you panic. Remoteness How remote a lake is obviously affects how quickly you can get help if something goes wrong, but less remote lakes have their own hazards. Unless you're at a public beach that's roped off and has a lifeguard, then your number one concern is often other people, particularly yahoos in speedboats blasting their music, drinking their beers and all looking out the back of the boat at their buddies riding their wakeboards, not paying attention to whomever might be swimming in the water in front of them. Be cautious on lakes where motorboats are present. Debris Heard of drift wood? Well it comes from somewhere, and floating wood in still water is trouble depending on how big it is. Dead heads are trees that have mostly saturated with water and float vertically just below the waters surface. Aside from devestating the hulls and motors of small boats, they can also give you a wicked bonk on the head if you're moving along through the water and make cranial contact with one, so keep your eyes out for what's in front of you, don't just get into your stride and watch the bottom, I have video of swimmers not watching where they're going and head-butting the side of my canoe. You can't even shout at them to warn them of obstacles, because they can't hear you under water. Be alert and aware of your surroundings when you're in the water. Rivers Rivers are far more dangerous to swim in than lakes for obvious reasons. Depending on the size and speed of the water, rivers can generate very powerful currents that can sweep you away, suck you under, bash you against rocks, pin you into a log jam, or throw you off a waterfall. It's important to know what hazards are present in a river before diving in and going for a swim. You also need to learn how to swim in a current. Getting back to shore isn't as simple as aiming for shore and paddling, because you are going to be moving with the current. You have to aim for a location downstream then swim perpendicular to the water's flow in order to reach the side, and try to time yourself so you reach the shore the sametime you're flowing past the point you're aiming for. If you miss your mark, don't try to swim back upstream to get to it, keep swimming perpendicular to the current until you can touch bottom. Swimming against the current is pointless and wears you out fast. Large slow rivers also often have commercial and recreational traffic on them, so once again you need to watch out for boats, as well as weirs (drowning machines) dams, and flood gates. . . . . . I often go out with "accomplished swimmers" into lakes and rivers, and they scoff at me when I hand them a lifejacket for a float downstream or playing on windsurfers. It's easy to change their mind about wearing a lifejacket simply by asking them, "How well do you swim while unconscious?" In rapid rivers especially, it's sometimes wise to wear a life jacket for the off chance you take a hit to the head by log floating by, or you roll over a rock and get slammed to the bottom. Or an overhanging log clips you in the head while you float by. They also provide extra warmth, padding (for bouncing off rocks when going for a swim in an extra "wild" river) and they can help you if you get a cramp while out over deep water. I know it's a pride thing for swimmers, but this is "wild water" so maybe consider it for your first couple times out if you're swimming out somewhere exposed or remote. 

Poisonous plants are typically more dangerous when you burn them, at least that's true with plants that have oily toxins (poison ivy/oak). Toxins in plants aren't necessarily vaporized when burned. Smoke is a particulate, not a vapour. If you are burning something toxic, the toxins can potentially be carried by particles of smoke and be inhaled which is far more dangerous than being consumed in some cases. Even dead plants can still be toxic. The toxin in Rhododendron and Mountain Lily is Grayanotoxin. Every material safety data sheet I've looked at says that Grayanotoxin is fatal if inhaled. But that's for pure manufactured Grayanotoxin II. That being said, this guy thinks Rhododendron makes great firewood: 

Injinji toe socks are by far the most popular socks to wear with fivefingers shoes. They keep your shoes cleaner, and help prevent funguses from forming inside them. Just keep in mind that if you wear toe socks in your toe shoes, that you can't exactly go back to not wearing socks, as the shoes will stretch to make room for the sock. If you don't wear socks in your shoes, then you pretty much have to treat your shoes like socks and wash them very regularly. 

A couple things I like about are that you can leave it on your rope when it's coiled, and you can make it slide along the rope, which is handy if you need to rappel with it a ways to get down to whatever sharp edge you're going over. It doesn't slide on it's own very easily, but it's got a small hole in it so you can tie a rat tail stopper or something with some small cord just in case. But once you've got it pinned against the rock it doesn't move. Another perk is that it stays with your rope, so if you need to swing or traverse you don't have to worry about your rope coming off of you edge protector. 

It's a flat overhand with one of the strands tied in a double overhand, which, if anything, makes the knot feel a lot more secure. What I want to know is if this is an original knot, or if it's already been discovered, has a name, and most importantly: whether or not it's being used for rappels. I came up with a different knot while experimenting, but found out online that it had already been invented and named "knot number 1452" back in the 1940s. This knot however, I can't find any evidence of it being used before. Does this knot have a name? Or have I come up with something new? 

A schoeller softshell would be best for breathability and wicking moisture. It doesn't seem to matter how much I sweat in my schoeller gear, it drys incredibly fast, but what you gain in breathability you often loose in weather protection. You may be interested in knowing that they do make backpacks that provide better ventilation for your back: Ventilated Backpack: 

Dynamic climbing is never recommended when mountaineering. The most dynamic you'll get is jumping over a gap. The first rule of trad climbing and ice climbing or any other form of high exposure climbing without fixed pro is don't fall. High altitude rock is not like what you may be used to climbing at a sport crag. You aren't guaranteed to be pulling on "clean rock" once you start climbing away from the graded routes. I've watched people pull boulders the size of refrigerators off of cliff faces just while scrambling up an easy face and pulling on a juggy hold. I always demonstrate to people how unreliable old rotten rock can be by pulling what appears to be good holds clean off a rock face when I recognize one. Climbing dynamically in an environment like that is a disaster waiting to happen. The big difference between sport climbing an alpinism/mountaineering is sport climbing is all about the style of climbing. It's about the moves, the beta, the grade, and the strain on your body. Alpinism is about conquering the mountain, the freedom of the hills. When you're planning your route to the top, you're typically planning to take the path of least resistance, and doing everything as safely as possible. You're much more likely to get yourself killed climbing dynamically on an exposed alpine route. That being said, there is a relatively new discipline of alpinism known as extreme alpinism where people take things to the next level and try to speed climb the worlds hardest mountains. Climbs that originally took weeks to summit, and have claimed hundreds of lives (many still claim lives annually) are now being done in on a couple hours by guys like Ueli Steck. But even though he's going for speed records, you'll notice when you watch him climb that he's not climbing dynamically as a sport climber would, he may throw out a dynamic move once and a while, but he's also arguably one of the best alpinists to ever live. The average guy wouldn't even think about it. 

Depends on your headlamp. I use a Petzl Ultra Vario headlamp for caving that can cast a beam 200m, so when I've got that on I can see pretty much the same as climbing during the day. I've climbed at night before, there wasn't any real significant difference. We happened to be climbing during a full moon as well, and as soon as that moon came out it was very bright on that rock face, much brighter than down on the ground in the trees. One thing we noticed climbing with headlamps, is holds are sometimes easier to find. Your lamp will cast a shadow behind the holds, making them stand out a lot more than during the day when the sun is beaming from above. One other thing about climbing in the dark is you lose the sense of how high you are off the ground. Your belayer's light gets smaller and smaller, but you don't get the same sensation as you do during the day. I think the greatest danger climbing at night, is falling rocks. You're not going to be able to see them coming, and if you do see them you aren't going to be able to react fast enough to get out of their way. I remember belaying at night and not knowing there was a rock falling until it hit the ground beside me, so keep your helmets on. 

I can't speak for lands inside a city, but out in the woods the best way to hide a trail, is not to leave a trail. I grew up in the sticks where growing up everyone I knew had a secret fort somewhere in the dense forest, the thing to do with your buddies after school was to hang out at your secret fort; building it up, fortifying it, shooting BB guns, or scouting around trying to find someone else's fort to raid for nails and other building supplies (there was no hardware store in town to buy that kind of stuff). Trails were a dead give away, if you saw a small foot trail heading into the trees off of one of the many access trails, odds were good you'd find a tree fort at the end of it, the hardest forts to find were ones that didn't have an obvious trail leading to them. If you don't want people to find your secret spot, don't tread down a nice path to get there, access it from different directions, but don't damage the under growth. This was easy enough for us to do in the East Kootenays, because there's loads of deadfall in the woods, so we would just walk along the fallen trees and never touch the ground. The trick is to Leave no Trace as you move through the bush, you do this by not disturbing any of the growth and traveling on durable surfaces. No one is going to lecture you about picking up broken glass and maintaining a pretty spot in the woods. Picking up litter is a service, and everyone enjoys when things look more pretty. But I wouldn't leave anything behind though, dropping swings and furniture on someone else's land is littering, doesn't matter if it's nice comfortable litter or not. Bring a picnic blanket and a hammock in your bag instead.
