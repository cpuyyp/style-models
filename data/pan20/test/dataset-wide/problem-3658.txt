There is a trend in fitness nowadays to frighten people about the danger of doing too much, too heavy or not being well prepared enough, ... In the end, people spend more time preparing for training than actually training. It is boring and counterproductive. Weight training is good. Just do it the smart way by striving toward correct technique and proper loading. Also, all efficient methods for gaining mobility and making actual changes to the body structures (for example, to fix your pelvic tilt or your shoulders) employ some sort of loads. Static stretching is the old way. Yoga can help but loaded stretching is more efficient. And guess what ... Weight lifting done properly can in fact be loaded stretching and can help with your posture :) Just apply a simple principle : progressive overload. Start conservative, listen to your body response and modify accordingly (increase the stress, keep it constant or reduce it). 

Response to training is very specific. Walking around with a Weight Vest is obviously a greater stress than your own bodyweight but it will do very little to improve your strength. Plus, if your strength increases it will be for activities close to the ones you do with the vest so I suppose mainly static or slow movements. There would be nearly no transfer towards actual activities which usually require to move and/or a greater speed of execution. To strengthen your ligaments, eccentric training as well as plyometric (take care if you have never done any plyometric work, it can be quite stressful) 

Long distance runners (anything above 800m) usually struggle with speed work because they don't take it correctly. During speed work you must run fast. If you drop below your target in terms of speed after a few reps, then increase your recovery between reps. Recovery during speed session is necessary and must not be seen as a weakness. Respecting the recovery while slowing down is counterproductive in such sessions. Look at how sprinters train. They do 3x60m full speed and then take 6 minutes rest before their next series. I am not saying you should go toward such extreme if you are not targeting max speed but you can certainly grasp the philosophy. 

I think this video (@5'30) describes the exercise you want. It also describes the way you can use it to target the chest. One exercise can target different muscles depending on how you use it i.e. changing little details can change the targeted muscles 

Check gymnastics related workouts and you will be fine regarding core strength. No equipment required. If you like to get new toys to keep you motivated and/or vary the exercises, paralettes can be a small and very useful piece of equipment, pull up bar and/or rings can also help 

For strength, look at gymnastic type exercises. Plenty to do without any material and working on the principles of decreased leverage. Try to do a planche or strict handstand push up and you will maybe notice that you could get stronger doing this kind of workout. Overcoming gravity book is a good reference but there are plenty others over the web and youtube. GMB is also good if you like more guided approach and programming supported by video. Pistol squats are also a good movement to make you realize that body-weight training can be challenging. Then if it becomes too easy, try doing it while having a weight in your hand (a book or whatever you have at hand) You can also use bodyweight movements to increase strength endurance (instead of strength, using higher repetitions range). For metabolic conditioning, you can always go running and use different pacing to target different energy system (sprint, treshold, long slow distance, intervals). Sprinting up a hill can also serve as a strength workout. Eventually, you can use this time to work on things you avoid when you have access to everything e.g. flexibility and mobility. I always pack something to foamroll and resistance bands in my luggage when I travel so that I can use them to work on my mobility/flexibility 

Sub 20 5k run is in my opinion not that difficult if this is your main goal. I have reached 19'50 5k without looking at my diet. Build your aerobic Base (aerobic treshold), increase your lactic treshold (treshold training) and work on your running technique (might require an external coach). Then plan strength training around that and rest accordingly. Read good books to get an understanding of Training in both endurance and strength and you will be good (Chris hinshaw, Cal dietz triphasic are ressources I recommend) 

I have been training during lunch time for 6 years now (the start of my professional life) Before lunch is obviously better than after regarding your comfort and risk of regurgitating food. Energy levels will vary depending on the type of workout you do. Light workouts will most certainly raise your awareness while hard workouts would decrease the energy you have for your work. From my experience, this is manageable. Regarding diet aspect, it does not matter much when you train. Digestion takes a while and if you eat something regularly (morning, mid-morning, ...) you probably always have something digesting in your body while training and therefore energy available. So taking this into account is not relevant. 

Why don't you adjust your training depending on the improvements/regressions that you see ? In training, it is stupid to have absolute rules based on my experience. You start with educated guess based on science/common practices/experience and you adjust based on what you observe and your objectives (diminishing mile time, muscle mass gain, ...) If your body develops as desired, keep going. If not, adjust (split your sessions into smaller ones, do less sets, ...). 

Your back is not supposed to work during these exercises. Your stabilizers (core, ...) stabilize your trunk and then the movers do the work (hamstrings, glutes, ...) If your back gets sore during squats or deadlift, you are most probably not performing the movement correctly and using your back muscles as movers instead of stabilizers 

You already accepted the answer but I will still come in. If you perform a search in Google with the following keywords "competing signal strength aerobic" you should find interesting articles. In summary, some research shows that aerobic and strength training sends the body competing signals. Practically, this means you apparently cannot optimally develop strength & aerobic at the same time. Focus on one, maintain the other. Then switch if you desire to increase the untrained skill. After reading this, I came back to a more "classical" training periodization after trainig "the crossfit way" for 2 years. Time will tell if I am right :) 

I would not suggest to use momentum first (i.e. kipping muscle-up). I would suggest to master strict muscle-up first then learn how to do kipping muscle-up. If one does not have the structure to support strict muscle-up, kipping muscle-up could mess up his shoulders. I would suggest working on eccentric muscle-up i.e. starting from the end of the muscle-up position (so above the bar) and trying to slow the descent. Chris Heria has such a video on youtube and it is apparently (youtube, reddit) quite efficient to build strict muscle-up. I am working on it right now using a smith machine to have a bar at the proper height. 

I would say : Listen to your body and track your progression rather than blindly following prescription such as "don't train too much in zone 5" First, you may not actually be in your zone 5. Your monitor could not be 100% accurate. Did you perform an actual lab test to determine your zones ? Second, if your body and mind both recover well from such training sessions (i.e. you sleep well, you feel good, you do not feel completely broken physically and mentally, you still want to train) and your metrics of interest (speed, endurance, ...) keep improving, then all good. Each person is different and responds differently to a training stimulus. If this works for you, all fine. Although remember also to think long term. If at some point you start noticing little injuries, pain, ... This might also be an indication that you are training too hard without enough rest. 

Without goals, devising a program is difficult since one does not know where to put the emphasis (cardio? Strength? Technique?). Plus, when you have a precise goal, you sometimes need to favor efficiency over fun factor while if you just train/do sport to be fit and in shape then you shall rather do what you find fun Taking the assumption that you just want to be fit and in shape without any particular goal, your programming shall be just based on common sense and personal feedback i.e. if you know you will rest during the weekend, then favor putting a difficult training (e.g. long bike ride or long run i.e. high volume) on friday, favor putting technical work when feeling fresh e.g. strength training involving barbell lifts or technical movement beginning of the week or before doing a run/bicycle run the same day. Arrange your workout to avoid strength/cardio work the same day (it is possible to do but since you just want to be fit, I would not see the point except if you have time constraints) and arrange your split in strength session to avoid fatiguing muscles you will use the next day e.g. legs before run/bike is not optimal To adjust your training log, keep track of your own sensation (tiredness, stress from work and other factors) and your results (e.g. a heavy drop in performance can indicate over training and you should reduce the load). Once you will have more precise goal (if you do) then you could fine tune your programming. Example programming for a week Monday : Strength (upper) Tuesday : Running Wednesday : Rest or Strength (core/legs or all body) Thursday : Strength (Upper) Friday : Biking Week-end : rest
