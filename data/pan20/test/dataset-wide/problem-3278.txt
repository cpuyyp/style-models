I guess that endings of "paucal forms" are nothing but a word meaning a few reduced to a morphem whose origin is no longer clear. In English you express the same idea not with a suffix but with expressions placed before the noun such as "a couple of, few/a few". And I assume the same is true for so-called dual forms referring to two things. One may assume that dual morphems have their origin in a word for two. 

If one puts oneself into the situation of an early age where the invention of words for numbers begins there is only one way to do it, by paraphrasing. You can express five by saying as many as fingers on your hand. Two: the number of your arms or feet, etc. Four: the legs of a cow or a dog One: the head of a man or head/tail of an animal If signs and geometrical signs have been developed it is possible to say: Three: the corners of a triangle Four: the corners of a rectangle or square. Latin quattuor (four) is very similar to quadratum (rectangle) or quadrus/a/um (rectangular). If words for one, two, three have been developed it is easy to express more numbers: Ten: two hands - Behind Latin decem (ten) might be two hands. Seven: a hand + two. Nine: two hands minus one. Eight: two fours. The further development of paraphrases will be shortening and contraction till a word form that is short and easy to speak comes into being. Probably the first stage was by means of gestures, such as showing the hand, pointing to the nose or to the legs. Maybe conventions developed for addition and subtraction of two simple numbers. 

"The door opened" One could derive this from "The door opened itself" with drop of "itself". Of course, one can explain this with the linguistic term ergative. But the traditional grammar has no problem to explain such verb use with traditional terms (reflexive with drop of the ref. pronoun). 

Chat language is a special language based on shortenings because communication must be quick and normal language in written form is too slow in chat room communication. One might call it a shorthand language. Such things develop wherever quick exchange of information is necessary. So specialists at stock exchanges have their own shorthand language as Mombi for German Moment bitte (moment please). 

The idea of a "natural way" of learning a language in the way children do is a bit naive. That would necessitate a mother that learns you to speak, an environment where all the others and you speak this language, it would mean five years of training in this language, then ten years of school where you learn the finer rules of speaking, spelling and writing. An adult person can't try to learn a foreign language in the way a child learns its mother tongue. An adult person has not the urgent necessity to learn language that a child has and children have by nature's programme an astonishing faculty to soak up their mother tongue. But about at the age of twelve nature shuts down this programme as if to say if you haven't learnt language by now I can't help you. Now other programmes are important. When children learn a foreign language at school they have lost this astonishing faculty to soak up a language, and an adult has the same difficulties, unless he has learnt already three languages, then the fourth or fifth language is a piece of cake because such a person has developed an effective way of learning a language. There are effective ways of learning a foreign language and ineffective ways. A lot of what is done in schools is, in my view, ineffective. 

A language that has eight case endings seems more complex than a language that has only two or none. But that is a wrong view. Case endings don`t fall from heaven as a present of God.They are personal pronouns as "him, to him, of him" or prepostions as "from to down etc". These markers were added after the word and, of course, they were shortened and tended to become irregular. A new and simpler system was to place personal pronouns and prepositions before nouns with the advantage that they don´t become irregular. The same is true for verb endings. They are logical particles added after the verbstem. The tendency to shortening and irregularity is much stronger as with nouns. And it is much more difficult to show how such things were constructed in detail. We can offer only hypotheses. 

I would say reading alone is not sufficient. There must be a lot of other activities involved. First of all effective vocabulary work with good dictionaries. Then effective grammar work. A sound knowledge of grammar is absolutely necessary. And then the most important thing of all, you have to develop your own faculty of formulation and of expressing yourself. And this must be developed in several stages, beginning with simple tasks such as giving definitions of words, explaining grammar points in your own words. On the next level you can try to give summaries of sectons of novels you read. Later you can try to give pictures of whole novels you have read or to write articles on topics you are interested in. Participation in forum discussions on the Internet is very helpful. 

One might say that plural endings are ultimately nothing but a noun + many, and a singular ending nothing but noun + one. Of course, this is a mere hypothesis and it would be difficult to find any evidence for it, as such things go back to earliest stages of language. But we may assume that singular and plural endings didn't fall from the sky. Man has developed them. At a later stage these endings may have been replaced by morphems developed from words as he/she/it and they. So it is not very probable that speakers say "tree+many+one" or "warrior+they+he". 

My attempt at explaning semantics is as follows. As a pupil I was aghast that a Latin word as ratio could have about twenty meanings and even more. I wondered how someone might get such a list into their head. Of course, no one told me that in dictionaries the meanings of a word are arranged as the editor likes, i.e. without any logic. I didn't know yet that a word has a central meaning like the trunk of a tree and that sometimes a word can develop several meanings just as a tree has several branches. And of, course I had no idea how words can develop several meanings. A word can take on meanings that are very near the original basic meaning. It can take the meaning of the consequences, it can adopt various meanings if the word is transferred into various branches of science such as mathematics, law, literature, music and so on. The ways how words develop meanings are various, but they are logical and follow mostly the same patterns which one can understand easily. Semantics is an interesting study and I think it is worthwhile having a look into such a book. If someone had shown me that the twenty meanings of ratio could be arranged in a way that shows how the word developed so many meanings I would have got an idea that it is possible to get twenty meanings into one's head. At the moment I don't know what good books are available on semantics as I have no need for this sector. If nessessary I do the semantics of a word on my own. But I know from my time as a university student that the books of Stephen Ullmann are good. Link to one title: Stephen Ullmann, The principles of semantics, with a review of the book. $URL$ 

My assumption is that English "as" has different sources and one source might be Latin talis - qualis ( of such a kind - of which kind) and there seems to be a connection to German als (when). In some uses, e.g. as yet, there seems to be a connection to German bis (until), and in some English dialects "as" is used for "that" + clause, which might somehow connected with German dass + clause. "as" as a conjunction can introduce a temporal, causal or comparative clause. My assumption is that these diverging uses developed by ellipsis such as 

How to explore such things if there are no data. The evolution of languages may cover a period of a hundred thousand years or more. A lot of books with a lot of theories have been written but all this is speculation. The beginnings of language are a great mystery. Jean Auel in her series of The Clan of the Cave Bear has presented some useful ideas about the language of the Neanderthals. In the beginning utterances were connected with a lot of gesture signals. But the Neanderthals appear late in the evolution of language. If we observe dogs we can hear and see if a little dog is wailing because it is left alone in front of the supermarket or if it is agressive. Without words the animal can convey information. Other animals like bees have developed a complicated system of signals to give information where good plants can be found. Over thousands of years the beginnings of language were connected with sounds and signals. It must have been an important step when words and word classes were developed. I think at first there was no differenciation between noun and verb. You could connect a word with "I" then it was a verb or with "many/no" then it was a noun. It is interesting to think about the beginnings of language - but we know nothing. 

Could there be some connection between Arabic falaha meaning to till the soil and German pflügen, Pflug or English plough, to plough? 

Latin grammar consists of two main parts. Part I describes the word classes and what forms these words can take, nouns, adjectives, verbs etc. Part II describes what parts a sentence has (subject, predicate, objects, predicative complement, adverbials), how sentences are built and special constructions used in Latin sentences as accusative + infinitive or absolute ablative. The Greek word syntax consists of syn- together and taxe from a verb meaning to set, to put, so the idea of syntax is how words are put together to form a sentence. The Latin way to describe language is extremely systematic and accurate. As a pupil in the higher classes I was filled with awe about this systematic architecture of language description. Unfortunately I miss this systematic way in English grammars by native authors.
