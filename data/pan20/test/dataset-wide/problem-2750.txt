People in the nearby area would likely contact emergency services. As a matter of policy, emergency services would conclude that you are demonstrating behavior consistent with a person who is severely mentally ill. Because you have become a hazard to yourself, they would pursue emergency psychiatric care. This would involve being taken to a hospital or other facility, where you would undergo screening and a battery of tests. This process is usually no shorter than 72 hours, but can be significantly longer if medical officials believe that you a persistent hazard to yourself. 

I'm just going to look at your second and third assumptions, because I don't actually understand what you mean by the first assumption. Assumption 2 can be expressed as "Time has always existed", and the Assumption 3 can be expressed as "The universe has not always existed". From there, it seems to easily follow that the answer to "Are there things that exist outside of the universe?" is "Yes, because we know that time existed even when the universe did not." Given these two assumptions, it is certain that time exists outside of the universe. I imagine that by making such a claim you are inheriting a lot of ontological baggage that would make you reconsider those assumptions. 

Self-harm is not strictly illegal in all jurisdictions, but you would be taken into protective custody by police in most, if not all, jurisdictions. I don't fully understand the philosophical nature of your question, since we have lots of instances of this sort of behavior being responded to in a fairly consistent fashion. 

In horror. They just watched a person perform severe self-harm in a public setting. They would believe that you are mentally ill. 

Kantian Deontologist "Why save them of course!" I think Kant would have called this a no-brainer. Saving other people when there is no apparent risk to you (as in your person, not your belongings) is a moral mandate. To see this, consider the first form of the categorical imperative. Kant would argue that we cannot rationally desire the state of affairs where every person in danger is neglected. I won't dive further into the argument, since Kant and others in his school already have. In short, you ought to sacrifice your fancy new shoes to save those children, and you know it. Virtue Theorist "We should cultivate in others the moral proclivity to rescue those in danger." This one is actually sort of complicated, because virtue theory is generally not concerned with individual moral dilemmas. For them, moral behavior is a consequence of moral personality traits and moral experiences. Whereas the consequentialists will be concerned with the outcomes of a given moral choice, virtue theorists try to do their good before the dilemma occurs. Creating a society that bestows good morals, so that individuals in that society are able to make correct moral judgments of their volition, is the morally sound choice. Now, I think you'll find that (most) virtue theorists do believe that saving the children is the correct choice; they're just not concerned with predetermining the response to every moral quandary. Teach a man to fish, and what not. In short, we should be making sure that we are creating the kinds of people that want to save the kids. Then we won't have to deal with silly what-if scenarios. Hope that helps! 

The short answer is yes. Moral theorists intend for their ethical theories to be objective; in the sense that you could derive the answer from a series of rules/axioms/principles/etc. An objective morality doesn't require some supreme lawmaker to act as the moral source, and some might argue that it could not be the case that morality originates in this way (i.e. Socrates/Plato's Euthyphro). To find a moral philosopher that describes an objective morality without appeals to the divine, we need look no further than Kant. He believes that morality ultimately derives from human reason, and requires nothing else to justify. There are some fundamental issues with the line of reasoning that without God (or some other divine lawmaker), morality serves no purpose. It denies the essential goals of morality, and tries to reduce it to a chess game where moves are only made to advance your position. 

I would offer that the fact you find the thought horrifying,"[that] no one could be obligated to respond to demands for justice", implies that the formal, logical imperative is unnecessary, for you and people like you, to hold and act upon the opposite assertion, "one is obligated to fulfill demands for justice." One could very well admit there is an disjunction between a thought, true or not, and man's operative and personal psyche without thereby having to take a stance about the validity of the thought. This argument that the moral implications of materialism exclude any who wish to be moral from agreeing with it is only valid if one holds that one must operate continuously with what one has agreed is objectively true. I know almost no one who does so-especially those with a modern education-, nor is anyone, under any theory, forced to operate in a continuous manner with regards to its implications. 

The essay/book contains the following paragraph: "The manufactured object, as opposed to (natural) useful goods, though it may still hold some habitual meaning (for instance depending on how metals are used, which can have emblematic meaning), loses its character as its manufacturing becomes more complex and diversified. The act of manufacturing, which becomes more diversified as it progressively gains complexity, replaces the use of goods (natural or cultural) with the efficient utilization of objects. Since manufacturable efficiency wins out on the profit level, the use of natural or cultural goods, which defines those goods according to an interpretation to do with their customary usage, is seen as sterile; use, that is, enjoyment, is sterile - since actual goods are considered unproductive in the manufacturable efficiency circuit. [...] In the industrial era, utensil manufacturing definitely broke with the world of sterile usage to set up the world of manufacturable efficiency, relative to which every natural or cultural good - both human bodies and the earth itself - is appraisable in turn." It may be my unfamiliarity with the terminology, which a fairly involved google search provides no clear answers regarding, but I'm a bit confused about exactly what he's saying. The natural, useful good, is defined as a good and as useful by the use human beings habitually make of it; that, I understand. His contrast between the 'efficient utilization of objects' and 'the use of goods' I find to be a little less clear. We have, within the habitual/cultural sphere, a finite amount of goods which have a finite number of uses: hence a set demand which is constant, does not 'reproduce'. In other words, the goods themselves don't produce demand, but a 'real'/'natural' demand motivates the production of the goods. These goods not having the ability to produce demand in and of themselves being what qualifies them as sterile? Or does he mean something else entirely? At the end of the book he makes reference to the production of simulacra, which being only means of evoking fantasies, are not bound by a set of 'natural' uses and can thus be priced arbitrarily, seeing as an experience cannot be quantified in terms of the cost of producing it. I see how the production of fantasies and their simulacra is not sterile-if my interpretation is correct- because the experience the simulacra is capable of evoking is the source of the demand; and also, every fantasy produced allows the conception of still more fantasies, or more simulacra corresponding to those fantasies, which is productive of more possible products to a theoretically infinite degree. He phrases this with complicated references to physiology and perversion-the usurpation of physiological instincts by the imaginative psyche being the lifeblood of fantasy and perversion (?)-, so even that interpretation could be off. Any interpretive aid would be appreciated, even if only in the form of a reference to things I might need to read to understand this work. Thanks in advance!
