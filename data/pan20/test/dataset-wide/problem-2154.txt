The time to wait is directly proportional to how much you want or need the job. It's important to try to contact the person you are meeting with while you wait, but as soon as you leave, you have lost the chance for that moment to make progress on getting the job. I would wait until you are able to confirm that the person will not arrive (and reschedule ASAP), or until it's clear that no one is coming -- however long that means to you. Of course it's unprofessional to keep someone waiting a long time, but delays happen. The people making hiring decisions are usually busy, and sometimes you may not get a second chance. Maybe the next day the company finds the person they want to hire, and you miss out. At some point, waiting a long time before finally getting interviewed speaks to one's dedication and resolve generally. 

The fact that your manager does not like you is reason alone to look for a new job, just to have options in case things work against you. In most cases, management wants you to follow the chain of command, rather than go around your manager to the VP level. The VP may really like your work, but at the same time may not appreciate the end-run, and probably doesn't have time to address your specific concerns. Going to the VP directly will only give your manager more reasons to dislike you. If the project team is as bad as you say, your absence will start to hurt them, and it will be obvious where the issues are. While you explore your other options outside the company, I would continue to work hard, do good work, and make your other projects successful. 

The client acted poorly. You did what any potential hire is expected to do. In business, taking candidates out to lunch or dinner is common, and acts as an incentive that gives the employer an opportunity to pitch the employer's idea. It's a cost of doing business, and an investment in eventually making a good hire. The fact that the client does not appear to understand this, and is running a startup, signals that the client has not done a lot of this before. Accepting an invitation to dinner does not obligate you to any commitment. You acted correctly by giving a counter offer. If rate was a deal-breaker for the client, then the client is remiss in not mentioning that sooner. Your goal in an interview is to put off rate/salary discussions until the last possible moment, so that you can increase your perceived worth to the client. I agree that you dodged a bullet, and more importantly that you did not do anything wrong in this scenario. Update based on the edit: 

I'm in app dev and not infrastructure, but there's a similar question on developer resumes with listing IDEs, platforms, and operating systems. Instead of listing (for example) Visual Studio 2003/2008/2010/2012/2013/2015 or SQL Server 6/7/2000/2008/2012/2014, I prefer just "recent versions of Visual Studio and SQL Server." By getting very specific your resume becomes noisy -- you also risk looking as though you don't have the most up-to-date skills. Plus, do you really want to get hired to work on old technology? Remember that your resume is an introduction to an employer. There's plenty of time during the interview process to discuss specifics. 

Start looking for a new job immediately. If the offer letter comes through (make sure it's in writing) in the meantime, you can decide then if you want to take it. This much of a delay is not a good sign -- either they are not as interested in you as they say, have limited funding, or are unable to make decisions. Well-run and organized companies should be able to communicate effectively, and execute on the tasks required. 

You need to push back. Get time on their calendars. Ask questions. Ask a lot of questions. Ask so many questions that they get tired of you and will give the detail you need. If they don't know, propose specific requirements and get sign-off. Document their answers and send the answers back to them for confirmation. That makes it clear that the cause for change and delay is them changing their minds, and not your development. When they say "build it your way," what they really mean is "do something that I can look at and change." It's much, much easier to revise and change requirements before they are implemented. 

Be direct -- tell the recruiter what you consider a reasonable deadline for making the decision. If you need a week, say so. Your deadline should include time to communicate and negotiate with the other companies. Having multiple offers is great leverage, but only if you have time to negotiate properly. Recruiters sometimes use the threat of an "exploding offer" to manufacture a sense of urgency, where the fear of missing out will make a candidate more likely to accept. Be careful of this trap. There are legitimate circumstances for an exploding offer -- for example, if a company needs to fill a position for work that needs to start ASAP, sometimes having someone in that role is higher priority than having the "best" or ideal candidate. The recruiter should be able to spell out exactly why the offer is only good for one day. The fact that the person you would replace is leaving does not necessarily indicate urgency. 

There's a difference between reference and usage -- between knowing what the phone number is, and actually making a call using that number. This really depends on the audience for your resume. If you know that the recipient is familiar with the usage, then format the number according to the most common and standard format. Another option, as mentioned by @DavidK in the comments, is to have two versions of your resume. Maintenance of multiple versions of anything is always difficult, so you might also include both phone number formats on your resume, something like this: 

Yes, your boss has plenty of reasons to lie, if in fact your job is in jeopardy. For example, they might need you for another month -- they would then have no incentive to be straight with you, since you might leave at any time. You can ask your boss all you want, but you will get the same answer. He can say with certainty that you are the best employee, and that he would keep you. But the decision might not be his. I speak from experience -- what you describe, as you say, are classic signs you're about to be let go. It's better to be wrong and prepared, so I would start looking for a new opportunity immediately. 

As long as you have multiple ways for people to contact you, however (including email and social media if applicable), the specific format of the phone number probably doesn't matter quite as much. 

Not sure if it's different in the UK, but in the US you can be released prior to your notice period. If you are prepared to be escorted out of the building the moment you give notice, and it will make no difference in your outlook or plans, then there's no harm in giving additional notice in hopes of sparing your employer the expense of training. On the other hand: 

Unless you are independently wealthy or have taken a vow of poverty, don't do this. Think about it this way -- your employer interviews and hires many different employees, and in order to stay in business, the employer needs to pay market rate. They know what different employees ask for, and they know what they want to pay. Some companies may give low-ball offers, but good employers want to be fair so that you stay loyal to the company. Most likely, they are offering you what you're worth to them, assuming you're not overqualified for the job.
