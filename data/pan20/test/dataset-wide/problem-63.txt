To be contrarian to other answers: In a male dominated society, allow males to have harems of up to 10 wives, and to own as many concubines as they wish (none of which are allowed to become pregnant; if they do, the pregnancy is aborted). Allow females to be sold (e.g. the Bible explicitly offers advice to men on how to price their daughters). Allow early testing for male/female fetuses, and insist that men have no more than two male heirs, but can have as many female offspring as they wish, and can sell these girls to other men. If any additional male heirs are not aborted, and are brought to term, they become slaves for life. Many more women than men will be produced; so the ratio of men to women will remain 1 to 10 or more. 

Take a look at Kleiber's Law, which shows how many calories an animal needs per day based upon its weight. This is a well-fitted and followed empirical law; there can be deviations of course, but you will get pretty close using this, and deviate if you need to, in order to deal with game requirements. For example, you might want Dragons to be especially hungry just so they require more time and money for players to keep as pets. Kleiber's law, says Kilocalories is proportional to $Mass_{kg}^{\frac{3}{4}}$. Convert lbs to kg by multiplying lbs by 0.4536. So for example, using Kleiber's Law, we'd expect a 154 lb person (that is 69.85kg) to require calories proportional to the number $69.85^{0.75}=24.16$. How does that help us? Proportional means we must multiply that answer by a constant, and the constant we choose is the USDA requirements for an average male: Which is 154 lbs. They say, for a middle aged 154 lb male, 2600 calories per day. Thus our proportionality multiplier is $\frac{2600}{24.16}=107.6.$ So compute your caloric requirements for the animal as: $calories = 107.6\times M_{kg}^{0.75}$ That is all with normal life sustaining activity for an animal, so includes activities of finding food, water, shelter, evading predators, etc. Humans (and perhaps other highly intelligent magical creatures) might require fewer calories by not requiring all these activities: I don't have to hunt for food or water, and my environmental temperature seldom varies more than about ten degrees from 75F, at least for any extended amount of time, so I typically burn no calories keeping myself warm. Many of us humans are quite sedentary and expend almost no energy doing any muscular work, relative to what wild animals must do every day to survive. Kleiber's law can work in reverse, obviously: If you want a specific number of calories K, you can compute $M_{kg} = (\frac{K}{107.6})^{\frac{4}{3}}$. So if K=2000 (calories a day), compute $M_{kg}=(\frac{2000}{107.6})^{\frac{4}{3}}=49.23_{kg}$, or 108.5 lbs. 

The Absence of need, combined with strict control of the mentally ill. In order to set aside "alien mentality" reasons, I have to assume their mentality is the same as modern humans, with all of our insanities, jealousies, greed and murderous impulses still intact, for every generation. So the main idea here is to eliminate the reasons we humans go to war in the first place. I think people go to war for two basic reasons. (1) They need something for survival (or continued life-as-they-know-it): Water, land, a food supply or other resources (like oil), or ... (2) They irrationally want wealth, resources they do not need, or desire the power to rule over and control the behavior of other people (by their own ideology or religion), as ends in themselves. Imagine a world in which all energy is free and unlimited. The capturing of solar power, or some fusion engines. Add to this world sophisticated robotics that can do 100% of the work, and 100% of the distribution of products. Because the energy costs nothing, the robots cost nothing, the products cost nothing, the food costs nothing, the medicine and medical care all cost nothing. Technically, no "economy" is required. Nobody has to work a day in their lives. Nobody has to pay for anything. Nobody will go hungry, or without shelter, or without medical care or drugs they need or mental health care, or without all the education they desire, or without comfortable transportation anywhere on the planet they desire to go, or without entertainment, for that matter. Although such a society could be more modern than ours in terms of electronics and entertainment, presume for this argument it has, along with highly advanced robotics (that will never try to kill them) all the most modern devices we have, Internet, mobile phones, air conditioning and heating, self-driving electric cars. Some reasons may be left for violence (jealousy over a mate, for example), but what reasons are left for actual war? The main thing I imagine is megalomania (the desire for power for its own sake), insatiable greed, murderous intolerance (often driven by race or religion), psychopathic leadership that enjoys causing death, and other "runaway" emotional states and irrational belief systems that I personally consider to be mental illnesses. Those can be addressed in this society also, and such people can be restrained, by drugs, monitoring technology, prison or just put to death when they commit a crime. Some of these mental conditions have been traced to structural problems in the brain. We humans are not advanced enough to correct those structural defects, but future technology might be able to, or might identify such defects in the womb and abort the child. They (like us) will always have amongst them psychopaths, sociopaths and other forms of insanity or compulsion (like rapists, or people that get a thrill from causing misery, terror, pain, and death). Because of that, I cannot imagine a peaceful society that abstains from all violence against its own people. No matter how good its defenses against off-planet invaders, they must still remain vigilant against the criminally insane within their own ranks, and many forms of this insanity can only be contained by violent apprehension (which could be by robots) and requires coercive restraint (prison) or execution. Law enforcement does not constitute "war" in my view, a society can be peaceful and still have some bad apples willing to kill over jealousy or pride. But by identifying such mental illness, we can prevent such people from gaining power in the leadership and manipulating the society into war for irrational reasons. It is, in my view, entirely possible to have a world of people that are content in what I'd call the modern middle class if they have no worries about their future safety or survival. Although nearly everybody entertains ideas of being rich or a celebrity or beloved by society, most never get that and are still satisfied with their life, their mate and family, and their place amongst the common folk that will, centuries later, be forgotten. I include myself in this category; while I have invented, educated, entertained and mated and had some commercial successes, I suffer no delusions of gaining immortal fame (and see no real value in doing so). Yet I am content to continue in my current role and vein for life, without ever achieving it: I like to solve puzzles, be creative and entertain people, pursue ideas I think can help others solve problems. So I think if I can come to grips with my own mortality and eventual obscurity, so can everybody else that is not mentally ill, and a society such as the one I described above is certainly possible: A world of sufficiency and comfort that requires no labor to survive, that minimizes suffering, and prevents the mentally ill from gaining power in politics, business or private life. One that identifies and controls the criminally insane quickly and thoroughly, through the use of force when necessary. 

I would rely on visual memory. Specifically, facial memory and picture memory. This is a kind of password system too, but a challenge instead of a personal password. Even in medieval times, we had art with superb likenesses and intricate artwork. So we have a gate keeper, and in his shack he has a thousand pictures of people's faces and various pieces of artwork that have their own names. (People can easily remember thousands of these, btw, when motivated to memorize them). To get into the village, get in a cage. The gate keeper will roll some dice to choose three drawings at random. They go in a frame; he flips it: Only you can see it: You have three seconds to name all three in order. If you fail on any one of the three, you remain locked in the cage, he calls security, and you are in for a very long fast; no second chance. If you are not a shifter, expect a few weeks of hard labor and remedial training. Do it thrice and you may not be allowed to leave the village anymore, or indeed be married and have children, because you are defective. Our gate keepers are kept under 24/7 protection and never leave the village, and we pick people with strong memories and very poor art skills, so even if captured they could not train the shifters to recognize the pictures or know the names of the villagers. And of course the gate keepers and guards are themselves tested every day before taking their post, by the guards of other gatekeepers: Everybody has to know the pictures. Duplicating the appearance of the human does not duplicate their memory, trained over many years to memorize these thousand images. The complexity and difficulty of that training make it too hard for the shapeshifters to hack. 

I have taught, I was a professor. As a graduate student my job (I was paid by the university I was attending) was one of eight "tutors", we provided walk-in help to undergraduates with their homework and projects, dealing with everything from the basics to the most advanced. Before tests we were swamped with students, and these are students of just five years ago: They have textbooks, iPhones, the Internet and Google and Wiki. All of those sources could have explained what they needed to know. None of those sources can PINPOINT what they needed to know by asking a few questions. That is what the human tutors and professors are for. Because despite all those resources, it takes me to understand, from the student's incorrect answers and where they go wrong in solving the problem exactly what they failed to understand, usually in the classes they took a few semesters ago, and in a few cases from misconceptions all the way back in high school. An AI can be like a calculator and DO math, but it doesn't understand math the way a person does, and the way a person learns it. Currently that takes another human, and probably would in a cyber-punk world too. If you want to learn something, you need a person that not only knows the topic but can detect when somebody else has an incomplete grasp of the topic, and can find the dividing point(s) of when their knowledge became broken. Usually by a bad or careless or overwhelmed teacher. In maths, for example, most people do find in the grade school topics, but you will find some broken by long division, or square root extraction, or high school algebra or geometry or trigonometry or Calculus I, etc. The classes they passed with less than a B for whatever reason. They failed to grasp something fundamental that becomes necessary later. If you don't understand long division, because you can divide numbers on a calculator, then you will have much difficulty in dividing polynomials, and in number theory that relates to understanding encryption algorithms. I do academic research in the AI field, to my knowledge no AI can do basic arithmetic on arbitrarily large numbers like a sixth grader can. I do not know of an AI that has been taught to multiply in exactly the same way I can teach a child to multiply, so it could correctly multiply two 100 digit numbers. Or do long division of one by another, like a sixth grader could (I am not the only one that could have done that in the sixth grade). AI can be very smart, but they aren't humans, and so far AI do not understand how humans learn and think, how to tell if they missed something or think something that is just a step off of correct, or even worse are sure they DO know something when they don't. That is the value of a human teacher, they understand human children, human body language, human facial expressions and micro-expressions to a degree no AI is even close to matching, and human learning: That lets them quickly identify and understand human failings, so they can correct them: That is teaching. Teaching is not reciting facts and figures and drawing pictures on the board. Those are the things to understand, and can be done by a robot. What the robot cannot do is answer "why" to off-the-wall questions or detect when a student is not understanding the picture on the board, because that individual is engaging in some idiosyncratic behaviors that (for them) indicate evasion or confusion or boredom because they lost the thread of the argument, or are preoccupied by some internal drama or fantasy. The teacher's job is not clicking through slides and reciting a script. It is watching the students to see if they understand the slides and the script, and spotting trouble, and helping those that stumble or fall down on the path to understanding. 

Shape the ship! Make it like a needle, with a very long (mile long) prow. Various materials are harder than diamond (See Here), I would suggest something like #1, carbyne, at 200 times the strength of steel and much harder than diamond. This shape won't deflect anything much bigger than your ship, of course: But you should be able to see those large objects, things larger than your ship, in plenty of time to change course. You probably also don't want to run into anything more massive than about 5% of your ship's mass. Your prow can be a combination of shock absorber and physical deflector that comes to a "sharp" point (relatively speaking; perhaps a dome a few feet wide), it is a cone ramping to wider than the width of your ship. It clears the way of any small debris, like satellite size or big rock size; such debris tumbles down the spear point and past your ship. This is to keep you from running into things small enough that you cannot see them in time to change course. Your sensors, of course, will be mounted near the tip of this prow. Since you are traveling at sub-light speed, there should be plenty of time for you to see very large things and avoid them. One more feature you can add is that this prow is not even attached to your ship; it is an independent path-clearing piece of equipment that you launch and then follow behind. In the event it does ram into something large and stops; your follow distance can be many miles (even a thousand miles), far enough that the cleared space cannot be filled with anything damaging after the cone passes, but long enough that, should the cone hit something big, your ship has plenty of time to react and not crash into the mess created; by stopping or veering off for safety. Given the hardness of the cone (which you can increase by sci-fi hand-waving), chances are it shattered or penetrated into anything it did hit; which should be very rare. But for safety, let it do its work separated from the ship itself.
