Can a hypothetical entity be sapient, while not sentient? My particular line of thought went this way: Humans develop an AI which is fully sentient and sapient, along with our understanding. Then we develop a derivative model, specifically deprived of features that comprise sentience, while not restricting the "intellect" part: 

Such an entity would be able to think - conduct inference, come to logical conclusions, learn, understand feelings, influence feelings of others, and lead a fully meaningful conversation providing initiative of the other party, but otherwise lacks basic features of a sentient being. Did I disbar any features which are essential to sapience, or is there something that would still make it sentient? Or otherwise, is some other sapient-but-not-sentient entity possible? 

One of strong currents in artificial intelligence research, which can be used in actual philosophy too is random generation followed by filtering. You forfeit logic, correctness and such for a time, and at best follow loose heuristics to create a full barrel of nonsense. Then you switch logic back on and go fishing in the barrel for some brilliance, shaping and correcting statements that show promise, recognizing parallels, applying exceptions. So, yes, a philosophy process can exclude logic for a time, to generate a set of premises and hypotheses that would be difficult or maybe impossible to obtain through normal rules of inference. Thing is, they aren't really useful until you apply scrutiny of logic and filter the true (and non-trivial) ones. 

"Truth", "Falsehood" are pretty axiomatic expressions, but even axioms need to be defined in common language terms. What are the "official" definitions of these in Informal logic, Formal logic, Symbolic logic and Mathematical logic respectively? (please, no non-constructive deliberations. If there are a few conflicting definitions, please just present the most prevalent ones. If one is missing, tell it's missing, don't try to design one on the spot.) 

Mathematics certainly can be wrong in that a mathematician presents a faulty theorem with an error in its proof, and it passes the scrutiny of peers and is commonly accepted as true. Of course after a time the error will be found and the necessary corrections made. Any theorem that follows the rules up from the axiom is correct. It may be totally unrelated to physics or workings of our universe, or it may be related and very similar but with important deficiencies, still, within its own framework it's correct as long as no (stupid) mistakes have been made along the way. Now an interesting point is some branches of mathematics use theorems without proofs. Famous mathematicians offer a hypothesis with a faulty proof, with known fault - the proof covers a large part of cases but some remain unproven. Now the mathematics follows by building upon that theorem, always with a little disclaimer "Assuming X's theorem is correct", and meanwhile there's a race between enthusiasts to produce a full proof, or alternatively disprove the dubious theorem. In these cases mathematics can be wrong, but only within range of the disclaimer. 

Don't allow hate to consume you. That way you only extend their victory: not only have they backstabbed you; they extend the poison throughout your life. Live your life well. Find your happiness. Don't let the past poison you - if you succeed despite them, then it's their loss. There are few things more sad than a person achieving their life's revenge and finding themselves with life completely empty: the revenge was their sense of life, and with it done, they are an empty shell with no purpose. Don't allow that. Make your life fulfilling. But don't forgive. By being a scourge, they lost the benefit of doubt we owe to all strangers. Scientologists use the expression "fair game". No injustice dealt to them, no malicious act, no inconvenience or harm is wrong - as long as you, or innocents don't suffer in the process. In other words, don't make the revenge a central part of your life. Make it an enjoyable leisure time activity. Don't make sacrifices, don't waste resources or your health, don't poison yourself or people you're close to, don't take stupid risks, don't make hasty decisions. Just patiently, deliberately, purposefully, systematically, safely, keep destroying them. In your free time, as an enjoyable hobby. 

Abstract is not bound to physical entity. Christian heaven is an abstract settlement of the deity, as opposed to Greek Olympus, which was a physical mountain - still, since no gods factually resided on its top, that was their fictional residence. Fiction works within our framework of known reality, filling in blanks with confabulation or altering chosen facts - it's based upon solid foundation of our reality with just relatively small alterations. Abstraction is an entity all upon itself, either existing as a parallel to reality, or apart from it. Karma and Rebirth are primarily abstract - they are based on existence of soul which exists completely beyond the reality of our existence, doesn't contradict it or conflicts with it, but exists besides, in an unprovable limbo. 

A brain is not a deterministic construct built from blueprints, passed through strict QA to check if it conforms to specs and performing precisely the way any other brain does. The "blueprints" for the brain - the DNA code - is not only unique per individual but also a lossy compression format, and the decompression process (growth of organism) takes a lot of "creative liberties" at filling in the blanks not strictly defined by DNA. Whether that means you do have free will, or your actions are predetermined by composition of your own specific brain in connection with your personal history and current conditions, is a matter of assuming whether the whole universe is deterministic or not. But two different embryos growing in identical conditions will grow into two different people - brains are unique, and the idea of "tabula rasa" - child's brain being entirely blank, generic and only shaped by environment - has been clinically disproven. 

This of course boils down to definition of omnipotence and omniscence - especially omniscence assuming inherent possession of all knowledge, understood and readily available. Of course that creates all kinds of problems. But let's take a mind experiment: You are in possession of a device that can fulfill any of your wishes and answer any of your questions. Technically, through this you are omniscent and omnipotent. Still, you are limited through your knowledge what questions to ask and what wishes to make. You don't know the future unless you specifically ask about it. You wish to have memory of all events future and past, and so the device makes it so, but still you need to consciously focus on a memory to recall it. You do know everything, but you don't know everything at the same moment! Eventually, through wishes that expand your potential of imagination you are able to transcend both the limitation of "memory access pipeline" and time and space - providing you choose to expand that far. You may very well stop at being able to see next evening and turn water into wine, and still be capable to expand beyond that and know everything, but never exploit that capability. So, while omnipotent and omniscent you remain a very humanly being with totally human limitations - self-imposed through your own choice. 

How distant a culture from ours would you intend to target? What is possible - for about any human culture - is to create a pictorial dictionary where nouns, verbs and adjectives are defined through images or set of images depicting them. After establishing the vocabulary, pictorial stories could define grammar giving example sentences. Once initial set of language is established, it could be used for self-expansion. This still depends on the targets being able to recognize the actions and objects depicted, and even on them possessing a sense of sight similar to ours. Yes, pure mathematics is very difficult to describe complex but down-to-Earth concepts - show a picture of a person with one leg extended, the other trailing, off balance and you have the definition of "walk". But scientists spent decades trying to program functional walking robots - in other words, define "walking" in terms of mathematics. And what if your target audience is only ever rolling or floating in water? How would you depict "walking" for them in a way they'd understand? So, while creating a language deriving its complete meaning from mathematics would be extremely, impossibly difficult, it's still quite possible to create a self-describing language based on mathematics, that contains such trivial concepts as "nitrogen", "wavelength spectrum", "light year", "electromagnetism", "fission", "atmosphere", "Oberth maneuver", "Planck time", while being utterly helpless with complex ideas like "sneeze" or "cookie". Edit: since it's far too long for a comment... First, you establish the language of mathematics: notation of numbers, operators, the whole "grammar" of mathematic expressions. We've established this is perfectly doable. Then draw a hydrogen atom, dimensions described in multiples of Planck Length. Any civilization understanding proportions, knowing composition of hydrogen and knowing Planck Length will easily recognize the familiar dependency, both recognizing the unit of distance and the type of atom, together with symbols for proton and electron. Add deuterium, with its mass, next to hydrogen's mass; we have a unit of mass and a symbol for neutron. Depict emission of a photon to obtain its symbol, a unit of energy, a unit of frequency and a unit of time. Armed with geometry, electron, proton and neutron you can define chemistry, all of the universe's composition. Using chemistry and geometry you can begin depicting physical macroscopic objects. Armed with time and distance you can describe motion and change. Together with motion comes temperature. Wavelengths define colors. Photon layout of reflected light creates image/sight. With motion, mass and location you can define gravity. Define air (mix of oxygen and nitrogen, temperature, inter-particle distances) and derive pressure. Add waves to define sound. With composition, temperature and mass you can describe stars. Frequency of pulsars will give a firm macroscopic coordinate system. After describing our Sun, you can get to describing Earth. Sphere, air, water, soil, hot core, surface temperature and pressure. Afterwards, proteins and DNA for describing life. Plants (chlorophyll, unmovable), animals (hemoglobin, moving). Human. Afterwards, depicting how human's body works (eyes as light sensors, ears as sound sensors, hands and legs as actuators) you can proceed to technology. Physics and chemistry will be essential. And so on, and so on - explaining how each element fits with the ones explained so far, you can build the whole dictionary. And yes, while possessing descriptions of motion and gravity, concepts of "Oberth Maneuver" are easy to explain. But to understand "cookie" you must know plants, grasses, grains, seeds, grinding, flour, sugar, baking, human digestion, sense of taste, and concept of pleasure. And while some are simple enough (taste = chemical analysis), others like pleasure will be incredibly hard and lengthy to describe, delving into evolution of instinct, separation of conscious mind from primal desires, and a whole course in human psychology.
