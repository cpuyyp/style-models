I am going to get beat up for this but steel frames don't fail catastrophically. Pull that post. If the end of the post is in the middle of the crack then look for a longer post. Get a seat post that extends at least 2" below the bottom of the crack and ideally 4". The post reinforces the frame. Mark the two ends of the crack. If the crack grows stop riding. I know this is kind of ghetto but put a couple hose clamps on the crack. That old frame is not really worth a professional repair. But you may be able to get a couple more years out of it. If that was an aluminum frame I would tell you to throw it away. 

You also have cylcocross (CX) and gravel. They are going to more nimble than a touring bicycle and more design to handle unpaved. Many people use a CX with touring tires as a city, commuting, or all round bicycle. Then you have a class called endurance. It is a versatile bike that is (typically) more roady than a CX. Look for one that will take 32mm (or even 35mm) tires. If it only goes to 28mm it is too roady for what you describe. Also have bikes called adventure. They are designed for all round use and many are also designed for touring (rack mounts and a little longer). They are typically steel. If you want to tour with a load then go with this as the above more race inspired bikes and will typically not come with rack mounts. This style of bike is not going to be as nimble nr fast as the above race inspired bikes. Salsa Fargo is an example. If you have the coin something like a Moot Routt 45. You could even go with a mountain bike with proper tires. You don't need dual suspension. You don't even need single suspension. You are not going to get very good road performance with the upright position. And drop bars let you spread out upper body fatigue. Look used. At the end of race season you will often find some really good deals. You may be better off getting an inexpensive bike that fits in the space and get some miles under you before you settle on the perfect bike. If you have the budget for 2 then maybe start with an endurance bike as with smaller tires it is a pretty legitimate road, trainer, and city bike. No matter what get a bike that fits you. Consider retail just to get advice on a good style of bicycle and a good fit. Look for a shop that at least carries adventure type bikes. 

Got this from a flight engineer (on flight engineer and he is also a commercial pilot) that works for one of the major cargo shippers and he says cargo on cargo and passenger planes is always pressurized but not always heated. Not sure if this is all planes but I found a couple references that the floor that separates passenger from cargo is not strong enough to take a pressure differential and they have blow out panels in the event cargo looses pressure so the floor does not buckle. In many cases structurally it is more efficient to pressurize the whole plane. 

If the keys are small could hang them from seat post and hide them in the seat tube. Or possibly hide them in the steerer (top of fork). Not very secure but tack weld the key ring shut and lock the ring to bike. Let the air out of a tire and hide the keys in the tire but now you have to pump up the tire and someone might steal your bike pump. A water bottle type safe where you can only get to the screws with the safe open. 

I am going to post my comment as an answer so you don't just start taking out links Put font and rear on the largest gears From there take out links If you take out too many links then it won't have room to go on the largest path If the hanger is not really designed for that bike you might have a case of you can't take out enough links But not all the bad - I bet if you have the front derailleur on the bigger gear you can put the rear on the smallest - so you do have access to the tallest gear 

It is as simple as full suspension feels like suspension on both wheels and hard tail feels like the front only. Use the full suspension for more and bigger bumps. Also for landing jumps. The hard tail is lighter and the pedal action is more efficient. The frame is stiffer laterally (more efficient). The rear shock on a full suspension will absorb part of the pedal energy (very little as it is designed to minimize this). For lighter bumps. The tail will get bounced around (much) more than full suspension. Bouncing a real wheel is typically not going to drop you but you are not getting traction. You will typically see downhill riders on full suspension. On single track it goes both ways. Your preference and the nature of the single track. Trials riders will ride hardtail. Some tricks like a bunny hop are easier on a hardtail (I think). If you are learning technique then I would go hard tail as it more forces you to pick a line. If you want to bang through some ruff stuff then full suspension. Tend to take harder falls on a full suspension as you can go faster on the bumps. And when those bumps are rocks it hurts. And when you ding a $1500 frame it stings. If you are going to get full suspension then get a good one. In looking at cost and weight of FRAME ONLY. I am going to compare Niner as that is what I ride and what I know best. Hard tail frame: Ross 9 large frame weighs 1,680g and retail list for $899 Soft tail frame: Jet 9 large frame weighs 2,980 and retail list is $1849 Now those are higher end frames and the difference is $1000 and 3 lbs On the mid range the difference might be $400 Don't buy a low end full suspension! My two cents: Don't buy full suspension for your first mountain bike Learn technique on a hard tail There are lots of times when you going to want to ride a hard tail Make it your second bike and be ready to spend some coin The guys and girls riding a full suspension for what it is are good and are on $3000+ bikes My three cents: Upgrade your hard tail to tubeless and go 2.25 (or 2.4 in the rear if you can) in the rear Not the same but at lower pressure you get less bounce (for NO weight) And you get the grip of conforming to rocks and roots And you get no pinch flats For less weight than the full suspension 

Tap another 5 holes is not enough. There needs to be metal to space it out that I suspect is not there. Just add a spacer would probably not handle the load. Even if you do attach are you sure there is room on the bike? Are sure you can find triple front derailleur for that bike? If you get past all that you may end up with chain line issues. Look at getting a bigger cassette. 

I don't see any chain in the video. It (most) will do that with no chain. The spring is (hopefully) strong enough to pull an untethered derailleur into the cassette. Park Chain Length Sizing Now the derailleur may also be bent but that is something different. The rubbing in that video is only a problem if it rubs with the chain installed. 

Pedal power can be a roller that goes against the wheel a dynamo in the hub. The power generators against the wheel are not very efficient and I do NOT recommend them. A dynamo in the hub is efficient but it is not cheap and requires a new wheel or a rebuild of an existing wheel. A decent dynamo with lights is going to be over $100 and closer to $200. The problem with a pedal power (dynamo) is that it is on one bike or the other. For sure you don't want to put a new dynamo hub on the old Mongoose. You cannot even share a wheel between those bikes as I am pretty sure the Mongoose is as 26". As stated by others tail lights are low power and last a while. You may want to consider a lithium ion light. Still have to charge it but it can be moved from one bike to the other easily. Maybe even two lithium ion lights for two mounts, two batteries, and two chargers (one for the office). Bike Lights 

Single speed last longer and cost less. More metal and less (no) flex. SS comes in 1/8 and 3/32. I would contend a SS 3/32 of the same basic construction is stronger than a 3/32 7 speed because it does not need to be built to flex and it is not flexed. I am not finding any pictures of 3/32 SS chains and the chain on my SS bike is 1/8. So I guess it is not really a straight comparison. But a SS will take a 1/8 and geared will not so it is a fair comparison. Also SS is built to take the abuse of a fixie. In a fixie the chain has to take the braking force and gets hammered. Note the question is SS not fixie. 

As for statistics Nascar instituted HANS like 13 years ago and they feel they have statistics that demonstrate that it is effective. HANS I get Nascar is not the same as a bicycle but once you protect the head the next thing you need to protect is the neck. 

A mountain bike or beach cruiser both for upright position and tire size. A touring bike with flat bars that comes in XS. Touring is built for extra weight. Something like a Surly Troll. Shorter cranks will reduce knee bend. Higher seat will also reduce knee bend. You are on the low end of bike sizing for adults. Most children (and adult) bikes are not built for that weight. Consider a steel frame. Consider upgrading the wheels and seat post based on weight. Start with a bike that fits you before putting more money into it. 

If you want a rigid fork for a 29er with shocks just buy a fork for a suspension corrected frame. If the fork is listed for a mountain bike then it is (probably) suspension corrected. I suspect that about any rigid fork that will take a 2" tire will be suspension corrected. Measuring is not going to do you much good as you can't buy custom lengths (that I am aware of). Below is a suspension corrected rigid - see the space at the top: For a workout bike I don't get why you need 2" tires? You are going to have trouble finding road 2" tires. There are some rigid mountain bikes (Niner Ross 9 Plus) and also the Salsa Fargo. Another option would be to buy a used mountain bike priced right because of a worn out shock. 

A secure bike rack is my first choice. Many business offer them. I avoid cheap racks that are not as strong as my lock. If there is a parking garage there will often be a bike rack in the garage. Not all places want you to lock out front. One of the sports arenas in my town will have the police impound the bicycle if you lock in front of the building but they do offer a rack in the garage. Careful with street poles as some pull out easily. You don't want to just put it somewhere you want it to be there when you return. Get a good lock. A larger lock will give you more options. Some businesses will let you bring a bike in. I forgot my lock one day and the grocery store let me shop with my bike. One store I go to has nothing so I have to lock to a trash can. I know this should not need to be said but don't block walkways or exits. Don't lock to operating equipment. I saw a guy lock his bike to a fire water valve. 

I like downhill larger platform pedals with what is commonly referred to as street shoes. I don' like advertising a brand but an example is the best answer. All Mountain Flats You have people advising clipless (spd) and I don't agree. Ironically clipless means the ski boot type clip in. But I don't agree with spd. I would do a 500 mile multi day ride on some big platform downhill pedals with the little spike and some and some nice street shoes. There is enough traction to hold your foot in position. You can move your foot around a little bit to change how you hit muscles. I will ride an uphill is a little different foot position. When you get off you can walk around and loosen up you legs. You don't have to carry another pair of shoes or sandals. Now a one day 100 mile ride - then I would ride spd.
