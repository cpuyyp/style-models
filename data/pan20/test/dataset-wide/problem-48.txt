Answer is simple - desire of individuals to better themselves and their families. If you take a look back at any period where humans achieved a massive breakthrough in production and productivity that improved the entire human civilization, it was usually a side effect of them wanting to better them selves somehow. I mean individuals, not entire groups necessarily. For example when colonies in Americas were set up people wanted to exploit the resources there for their own benefit in order to generate wealth. They went to the colonies themselves as incomes were better then what they could earn at home. Pioneers borrowed coin and promised great returns on investments. Remember that it is usually not the case that 1 mega-investor gave most of the capital and expected a return - most probable case is that many, many people would put some of their savings in the hands of the few to try and gain some return on that small investment. With that money, the pioneers could start to colonize, build, invest and produce while the initial borrowers could buy something nice once their return on investment came back. Beneficial for everyone. Infrastructure is being built for exploitation of natural resources in order to profit from them. However, creating that infrastructure needs more workers. Which required more resources like food, clothing, tools, housing, which required more infrastructure... it is a snowball effect where wealth attracts wealth. Countless people see that they could sell their services in this new sector better so they move and try to make a better living. With more wealth and territory human populations explode in size, which in some years ends up requiring even more resources to be acquired etc. While some people notice the growth and wealth being generated are naturally attracted as it is a whole new market with very little competition and a relatively easy entry, others simply want a new adventure, a life away from their old family (they can marry someone the family does not approve of perhaps?). They like risk, they follow their friend how got them an amazing position in some excavation company etc. This snowballing effect would go on until humans reach some sort of equilibrium - extraction of additional resources is no longer straightforward and entry in to the industry becomes difficult. Human populations grow rapidly but are eventually forced to slow down their growth once easy wealth-generation spots are filled in. Governments slowly start putting in regulations to prevent injury or dangerous activity. Additional bureaucracy, that attempts to achieve good, slows down human activity as it puts a heavy cost of entry (licences, training, taxes etc). But guess what - a new colony is just being made and life is a bit easier there and money can be made so much easier. You work the same hours but you get like 3 times more money because they are short on manpower... and the cycle repeats it self. Only limit is technology and government. 

Humanoids living and walking along the bottom of an earth-like planet would have to put up with extreme pressure, wouldn't they? So, first of all they'd probably be shaped differently - shorter, squatter, beefy-er, etc. Their bone structure would likely be more dense. Given that they could breathe air, they might find walking on the surface of the earth a little like flying - definitely liberating. 

When dealing with a collective consciousness of any type the best weapon is logic. Think of those ancient Star Trek episodes where Spock presents a paradoxical conundrum to a computer about its behavior and it bricks (after a lot of rattling and smoking). You could do the same to the ants, we're assuming they can communicate and that they're either following the edicts of their queen or some sort of ruling council or quorum. So what argument can you present to the collective consciousness that would show that it needs to stop attacking the terraformers because they are providing something that would help the ant-hill thrive - even while they have some sort of imperative to attack the terraformers. "Must attack humans, but humans give us "x" with the terraforming, must have "X", but must attack humans...." Eventually the ant-hills break down and become just a bunch of regular ants which are good for the terraforming process. 

In general, totalitarian (and other despotic) regimes are great at huge unreasonably expensive projects, just look at the pyramids, or the terracotta army and the whole mountain sized complex that houses it. The only real costs to the regime leaders are time and natural resources. Are they willing to concentrate on a project that may not yield any interesting results before they are dead? Does using resources (including people) to make it happen divert those resources from something else they want have accomplished? Currency would probably not mean anything to the regime (they already own everything that can be bought with it) 

I've read some conflicting theories regarding ancient atmosphere (some say it had more oxygen, but others dispute it) being relevant to survival of large dinosaurs. So my question is: is it realistic, from the point of view of known science to have Cretaceous Period dinosaur alive today? (Assuming it was successfully brought over somehow, maybe in a large time-truck) 

First, consider the psychology of the dictator - that personality trusts no one, has to be first in everything, is extremely egotistical, paranoid and intolerant - especially of disloyalty. So impressing him would mean you're a totally loyal sycophant, but you'd have to be a useful one. Would a dictator encourage cooperation? Not really, that personality is too paranoid. Autocratic tyrant is a synonym for dictator so same applies. A democratically elected leader, however would be another story. Since a hierarchical culture style is set from the top down, the leader would himself have to demonstrate the merits of cooperation, and then develop a reward system for those minions following his example. 

On intake, implant inmates with a tracking chip which is multifunctional. The chip also "receives" a paralysis field that is broadcast across the prison and its grounds at 2200hrs. This field can also be attributed to the zero jailbreak record of the prison, because it can be turned on manually as well as being set for automatic-on state at 2200hrs. Something to think about is - if this practice becomes widely known will it have an adverse effect on the political ambitions of Ytra? 

There are so many ways to incite rebellion, but in general find out what people are most fearful or angry about and who they are suspicious of, then blame the latter for the former, while insinuating that the government is protecting them. If you want them to be less evil and go after the government directly it could be harder depending on what sort of the reputation the leaders have, sometimes oppressive people are popular (ex. Vladimir Putin). There probably needs to be more information to really provide a detailed answer, but other common tactics include provocations, sabotage, pretending to be the rightful king or queen, accusing the ruling class of having a different religion or not believing in the dominant one, accusing then of not being real members of the nation (if they have some foreign parentage) 

What is the purpose / significance of the symbols in the eye? Identification, differentiation? Where would they get the idea in the first place? Maybe someone born with a genetic mutation? 1. maybe that mutation indicates they're from the ruling family - in this case the poser (person with fake lenses) has the potential of gain. 

Consider a smallish cube, self powered and capable of projecting interactive holograms. If your far-future race communicates verbally, the cube would be equipped with a language-learning routine, so it would learn the language of the future rather than the inverse. Holographic projection would first allow picto-graph type communication until the cube learned the language and then it could begin to communicate verbally. Preserve it inside one of those molybdenum aluminum boride mononiths (thanks to Pommerbot for the science!) and make it a "quest" to get inside the monolith with all the associated rewards of solving the quest. 

Races of similar origin that have made a divergence in their evolution adapt to their environment. Looking at our world, the differences usually show up as: 

Easiest way to do this is to treat it like martial arts, which is the most relatable thing to magic in our own world. If you read Miamoto Musashis 'The Book of Five rings' where he explains his mastery of swordsmanship and how to perfect it yourself you will often find that he cannot explain a concept with certainty. Closest he can come to is a feeling, an instinct that becomes part of you after endless repetition. He tries to compare it to other subjects but often fails because he just cannot describe an internal, intuitive knowledge so he says "it is easy to show this but difficult to describe". In my opinion magic should be treated the same way. Something elusive, difficult to master and explain. Something that relies on repetition and intuition. Internal understanding. 

There are a couple of approaches. First you don't want the trees growing too close to the city/castle, so making the land difficult to root in key. Put rocks and salt in a nice wide ring around an area. Second, if certain forests are suspected of being especially dangerous use a parasite to weaken them, something like a pine beetle should do. Although that could make high quality wood harder to acquire so probably keep that as last resort. In a pinch though, burning tar or oil would be the way go as it's nice and sticky so can burn the three for a while, if nothing else it'll force them to disperse or risk forest fire 

To answer how an altruistic society might evolve, look at what caused it to evolve to be the way it is now. Most of human history there was scarcity of food and a lot of danger from predators or other human tribes competing for food, so physical strength and ability to amass resources were very important for survival or the group, so such people were viewed positively by society. In the modern world fighting off bears is less of a concern, and a much bigger problem might be environmental collapse. If you extrapolate that further, you could say that in few short thousands of years (or hundreds if you want to be optimistic), humans will evolve to dislike greed, due to it's wastefulness and environmental concerns, while emphasising non-violent cooperation, since efficient use of resources is more important then fighting off things. Eventually creativity, ability to get along and not-hoarding things might become more socially desired then strength and wealth. Also robots will do all the heavy lifting so who needs strength, am I right? 

maybe that mutation is just the most outward indicator of a suite of mutations that includes a superpower - in this case the poser puts himself in potential danger 

In one possible scenario you'll need three elements. 1) A launcher of some type on a orbital platform 2) the Clarke elevator/skyhook to get to the orbital platform and 3) a wormhole network Take the Clarke elevator to the orbital platform, board a launch pod, launch pod is loaded into a launcher and sent through a wormhole to its destination. Of course if the launcher can get the pod up to FTL speed, you might not need the wormholes. 

Lot's of great possibilities. Locomotion: Smaller animals could have small wings, or winglike structures (think flying squirrel). Floating animals (filled with gas) could use that gas for propulsion, like attitude jets on a space craft (and they would not have to be located only at front and rear, you could have a gill-vent for turning, etc.) Considering your planet's 60% water you could reasonably have amphibians who could fly in the air and use the same wing/fin / propulsion combination to move about underwater. Predators: would have to be fast and accurate - think moray eel, both in and out of water. So their prey would have to be faster and smarter and trained from birth (or have genetic memory) for evasion.
