So, when a person runs marathons, lifts low amounts of weight with high repetitions, or uses an exercise bike on a light setting for a long time, they are toning. Yes, cardio is the primary workout for running the marathon and exercise bike, but they are still toning the muscles that are being worked. That was a practical example. I left my physiological definition of what happens to slow twitch and fast twitch fibers in my other pants pocket. Exercising is a hobby of patience, so if you want to stay 'toned' for longer than a week your going to have to keep up a lifestyle of exercising for quite some time. 

If you're running that far/long, I wouldn't be concerned with the calories from gatorade as much I would be the quantity and quality of calories from the rest of my diet. Looking at the nutrition of a bulk gatorade powder, a 20oz has about 134 calories in it, and @ 34g of sugar those calories are pretty much all from sugar. However, from experience, all electrolyte replenishers I've seen on the market have a high sugar content, probably to hide the saltiness of electrolytes. I'd be interested to know of any on the market that don't. Marathon running will burn calories, not necessarily fat, at least not fat alone. It will burn calories whether you drink water or gatorade or anything else, to lose weight you require a calorie deficit. There are other questions on the site that breakdown steady state cardio and what it does for weight loss, so I'll point you here! 

You'll notice I didn't speak much about endurance speed and strength training. There's info on the site about training in this fashion, but to summarize: Endurance training involves mostly low intensity and long duration. For your particular application, start the stairs slow and make completion your goal. Strength -- To put it simply -- is the polar opposite of endurance. This high intensity short duration. There are some merge areas between strength and endurance where you'd work both, but that's out of scope here. For your application, this is where you'd pick the amount of stairs you want to climb at once. On one extreme, you could jump 6-10 stairs at a time (or however many your stride length allows), but the duration would be extremely short. On the other extreme, you could stick to one stair at a time. You'd have to find your own sweet spot, but as you found out, endurance is key so strength should be an afterthought. Speed -- 'nuff said. Hopefully this helps future visitors also, as well as your training for next time. 

I'm no MD, but when I first started cardio I my chest would get tight also. However, for me the reason was simple: The diaphragm is a muscle! Wiki. And, it should be trained like any other muscle. Slow and steady at first, trying to run too fast too soon (soon as in inexperience or too soon into any particle jog/run) will fatigue the diaphragm and wear the runner out prematurely. Once I slowed down, and took my time, the tightness would come back after so long, but I could tell my lungs were getting stronger. (hint, that's why products like this are on the market). As far as the mental goes, It's one of those things (for me at least) when the body starts to fatigue, mental narration sets in and says it's time to quit. How hard you fight that voice is up to you, and it's that fight that separates a mediocre day in the gym from an awesome one. I would try running on a regular basis if I were you, to see if it goes away. Remember to only change one variable at a time: So, for example, if you're increasing running frequency, don't increase duration or intensity. To build on that example: If you start running 3 times a week instead of one (frequency), don't try to run farther or longer than usual (duration), or increase your distance in any given time (intensity). Stick to one or the other, either a set amount of time, or a set distance. If the tightness continues after a few weeks, and your cardio endurance isn't increasing, there may be something else going on. Final thoughts: Make sure you eat halfway decent also, since this isn't a diet q&a site I have to refer you to other corners of the 'net, until the nutrition site is up. Consult a physician before participating in any exercise regimen. 

As for the type of warm ups you could do, one comment to your question suggested jumping jacks and that's a great warm up that will accomplish the goals above. Another one is burpees, which is kind of encroaching on the push up kinetics a bit, but still worth a mention. Mountain Climbers as well, just to name a few. Note: I didn't used to be a warm up person (1/4-1/2 mile jog before weightlifting was about it), but I've since re-thought the whole warm up idea. 

I'm currently 5'9", 262.8 at last weight in (about 10 days ago). I'm still cutting, by no means am I 'obese', although that's what my BMI says. I have plenty muscle mass, but to be honest I could stand to lose a few pounds (got married, stop lifting, etc). At my best physique I was between 175-195, and BF% floated between 7-10%. The downside of that is, according to the blanket bmi chart I'm dangerously obese, and even at my top physique I not even close to the target range (160 is definitely out of the question). My health insurance provider (among other companies) regard BMI as the end all be all of healthiness, which is certainly not the case. So, my question is: Has anyone been able to talk with these companies regarding this? I know I'm taking a chance with this being off topic, and that's fine (we need off topic examples anyway) but I know I'm not the only person in this dilemma. 

Resistance training for toning (aka endurance lifting) is used for toning muscles. There may exist a formal definition somewhere, but I like to think of it as 

One book that I would have loved to purchase when I began lifting is Starting Strength, no affiliation. In this book the authors recommend starting with the bar (a standard olympic bar is ~45 lbs). This sounds counterintuitive, especially for a heavier person, but there are reasons for this. When learning the exercise, form corrections are best made before weight is added to the bar. After the exercise is learned, one should always start the exercise warm up sets with the bar to get the blood flowing, warm up tendons/ligaments, and other things. I'm summarizing b/c I don't fully remember, but I read enough to know it's important, and I have done it enough to know that it helps when your legs are still sore from two days ago, but every day is squat day, that easing into your warm up sets with the bar isn't so bad. :-) Update I'll add that in that book there are logical progressions for adding weight to the exercises, if that's your next question. If you feel like you're not progressing "fast enough", take your ego out of the picture and just follow the routine, they've done all the heavy lifting for you. Odds are if you stick to it you'll naturally elevate to where you should be. Update 2 Note that this isn't just for gaining weight. Heavier people will lose weight while gaining muscle (such as myself), while those with less mass will gain weight. The diet is then difference. So in the OP's case, this is a viable option although it goes against the mantra of 'low weight more reps'. Partly because while that advice works, once your body adapts to that low weight at a certain # of reps, you will no longer tone and have to increase the weight to get the same effect. Not to mention the effects on the body's metabolism are different. 

@Edgar has a point about the BCAAs, but taking Glutamine may not do much for you if you don't take it properly, and still may not help if you take enough. The thing about glutamine is that a vast majority of what you take is absorbed by the gut. So, if you want some to make it to the 'muscles of the day', You're going to have to take a lot, and by a lot I mean 20+ grams in a setting, to get past the GI Tract since it has been observed to absorb up to %40 of the ingested glutamine. In short, glutamine can be produced by the body, and during intense physical stress (such as a high resistance workout or surgery) glutamine levels in the blood stream can be depleted. The debate is whether or not it helps as much as its following claims it does. Check out the active ingredient in that one. Sources: Years of bodybuilding (partly taking glutamine along the way, 20+ grams daily), and extensive reading on the subject. Case in point here, and part 2 of that same article 

Generally, if you want to perform an exercise set then a warm up is preferred. We all know this, but I found some great documentation on what a warm up actually does, and why one should do it. Most notably: What does a warm up do? 

It's not mandatory to use the same weight for every exercise in the circuit, especially since some exercises may not require weight at all, and some may require more weight than can be performed with other exercises. The main thing to keep in mind with circuits is to keep moving. Try to pick weight that will allow you to complete your circuit the first time around, and then try to increase the resistance or circuit repetitions, depending on your goal. 

The best way to prepare for a real life situation is to train the same way, at least mostly. So, in your specific case, You should start by climbing stairs. You don't have to climb the same amount as will be in the competition, but start gradually and work your way up. Since this competition is about 1) Endurance 2) Strength 3) Speed So you should train those aspects in that order. I say that order because you can't finish if you don't have enough endurance or strength, no matter how long it takes, and strength means nothing if you've 'maxed out' by the second flight. Train the primary muscles This includes climbing actual stairs, as well as the stair stepper at the gym. Given the choice actual stairs are your best option, as they directly relate to what will be required for the competition. One or two stairs isn't really relevant at this point, because you will be focusing on cardio, legs, and glutes, and it will tax you :-). The point of this section of training is to get the primary muscles ready for the competition, to make sure they are physically prepared to go the distance, and they will know what to expect. Train the secondary muscles Secondary muscles are sometimes overlooked unfortunately, but this would give you a slight advantage against other competitors who don't train them. Often called support muscles, these are the muscles that help the primary muscles function. Think of how a bench works (primarily)chest and triceps, but secondarily works the shoulders and traps. The secondary muscles in your case could be abs, calves, and even shoulders -- if you swing your arms back and forth when you step. Bottom line is, you should see slight to decent improvements when training if you work these muscles outside of primary training. This doesn't have to be super-intense or heavy training, light-weight high-rep training is fine, this is endurance training which is exactly what you want. 

If you want to get the most out of your workouts, then training in your target heart rate zone is one step toward doing that. Hence the word zone, its actually a range of bpm that you want to stay in during your workout. From what I've seen, %50-80 of your max is sufficient, I don't think anyone can train very close to their max for very long. They also don't say much about if a certain exercise will put you there. If you've been biking long, then biking the same route every day may not put you in your t.h.z. like, say, sprinting for example. It's all about adaptation there. The calculators are also an estimate, don't be afraid to dial it up or down as needed. If the monitor says your operating at 160 but you're barely breaking a sweat, try wearing a weight vest for added resistance, for example. After listening to your body in addition to where the formula puts you, you'll know your true target heart rate zone. This is one THR calculator. 

Remember, in terms of physical fitness, 'bigger' and 'stronger' are not synonymous. You can get stronger without getting much bigger, and vice versa. To answer your title question though, high intensity exercises altogether stop you from getting bigger and/or stronger (for the rest of this answer, I'll focus on 'bigger' rather than stronger). However, they do cause an increase in metabolism, and if you're not keeping up with the demand by taking in more calories than you burn on any given day, then your body will make up the difference by taking from your reserves. The thing to watch out for in the case of doing regular HIIT is that HIIT typically spikes your metabolism for a long time after the training, so just adding a handful of legumes or nuts to your regular diet may not cut it to gain weight, depending on your circumstance. The good news, however, is you can eat as much as you like if you want to gain weight, just stay away from the sweets! From the thin people I've run across, they're always surprised at how much they have to eat to gain weight! I've never had that problem so I can't relate... Before you start your training, I'd advise you to keep a diet log of everything you eat for a period of time (1-2 weeks should do), and get a good caloric estimate per day of what you take in. There are Base Metabolic Rate calculators out there that will give you a decent estimate of what you burn per day, without doing any work. The # they spit out isn't set in stone, but the actual rate should be pretty close. From there, add a minimum 500-1k calories to your diet per day, every day, if you want to get bigger. If it's easier, you can start with an extra 250-500, and work your way up every day. Now you have a baseline for your hiit also. Once you start jumping rope, you might find yourself more hungry even after eating your extra calories. This is your metabolism speeding up. At this point, you can choose to keep your calorie intake the same, or take in more to keep your mass the same (or even increase your mass further), it's up to you. Finally, none of this will happen overnight. Do not expect to demolish a large pizza one day and be your dream size the next day, it doesn't work like that lol.
