So, it appears that the situation of Melania living separately from President Trump is a temporary one that is currently projected to end some time around May of 2017. So, even if it still did cost nearly $500,000 per day to protect Melania and Barron, this situation is currently planned to only last several months. As a result, even if it did cost that much per day, it wouldn't cost more than the National Endowment for the Arts on an annual basis due to the situation's limited duration. 

Cost for National Endowment for the Arts According to its own website, the FY2016 budget for the National Endowment for the Arts was just under $148 million. Comparison CNN's original figure of "more than $1 million per day" is indeed more than double $148 million per year. However, at the rate used in the more recent estimate in New York's request for compensation from the federal government, the annual cost of security would be about $173 million per year, which is obviously not double the NEA budget of $148 million. Additionally, New York has not yet indicated what it expects the cost of protecting only Melania and Barron to be vs. the cost of protecting Trump himself in addition to Melania and Barron during the transition period. 

This claim is currently unproven. According to a Snopes article written today, which rates this claim as unproven, Chapman cited the CNN article linked below as his source for the security cost and he cited the apparently-correct figure of $148 million as the budget of NEA. 

Brain Effects by animal studies — "It’s simply not known how alcohol will affect the long-term memory and learning skills of people who began drinking heavily as adolescents. Scientists currently are examining just how alcohol affects the developing brain, and research has shown that animals fed alcohol during this critical developmental stage continue to show long-lasting impairment from alcohol as they age". Alcohol use during DSM-IV alcohol dependent adolescence is associated with prefrontal volume abnormalities, including white matter differences. Additional research is necessary to know the exact effects of alcohol on the adolescent hippocampus and other brain structures and to better understand the long-term implications of adolescent alcohol exposure. Liver Effects — "Elevated liver enzymes, indicating some degree of liver damage, have been found in some adolescents who drink alcohol. Young drinkers who are overweight or obese showed elevated liver enzymes even with only moderate levels of drinking". Growth and Endocrine Effects by animal studies— "In both males and females, puberty is a period associated with marked hormonal changes, including increases in the sex hormones, estrogen and testosterone. These hormones, in turn, increase production of other hormones and growth factors which are vital for normal organ development. Drinking alcohol during this period of rapid growth and development (i.e., prior to or during puberty) may upset the critical hormonal balance necessary for normal development of organs, muscles, and bones. Studies in animals also show that consuming alcohol during puberty adversely affects the maturation of the reproductive system". 

The cited CNN article is from November 21, 2016, while Trump was the President-Elect and was still himself living in Trump Tower prior to taking office and moving to D.C. It says: 

The statements in the meme are generally correct, but there is no evidence to support the implication that those countries were excluded because of Trump's business interests. The answer to the title question is, no, Trump didn't exclude those countries (nor did he or his administration explicitly include or exclude any other countries.) The relevant section of the executive order signed by Trump (Section 3(c),) did not actually list any countries at all for the entry ban. Instead, it applied to a list of countries that has already existed under U.S. law for several years and was most recently updated a bit under a year ago by the Obama administration. 

8 USC 1187(a)(12) defines countries whose nationals are explicitly excluded from the U.S. Visa Waiver Program due to terrorism-related concerns. Iraq and Syria are explicitly included in this list by law. The other countries on the list are designated by the Secretary of State or the Secretary of Homeland Security due to terrorism-related concerns in those countries. The most recent update to this list of countries prior to Trump's executive order was issued by President Obama's Secretary of Homeland Security on February 18, 2016, just under a year prior to Trump's executive order. 8 USC 1187(a)(12)(A) provides that the Secretary of State may designate to this list any country "the government of which has repeatedly provided support of acts of international terrorism." 8 USC 1187(a)(12)(D) provides the authority for the Secretary of Homeland Security to add countries (or areas) to this list: 

Also stolen or retrieved nuclear material from lost warhead incidents is also of a major concern. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has reported more than four hundred nuclear smuggling incidents since 1993, sixteen of which involved highly enriched uranium, the key ingredient in an atomic bomb and the most dangerous product on the nuclear black market. 

However, caution is advised for elderly and immune-compromised individuals when drinking untreated rainwater collected from roofs due to presence of pathogens. 

Drinking alcohol in cold weather might reduce the body’s ability and tendency to shiver resulting from alcohol-induced hypoglycemia which again contributes to hypothermia. 

One key almost certainly can open someone else's lock in 'n' number of possibilities because even with the best locks, there are a finite number of combinations to which the lock maker sets the levers or pins. Therefore, eventually there will be duplicates of the pattern of locks. Padlocks typically having fewer than 1,000 effective combinations and cylinders having fewer than 20,000 combinations for lockers do not rank in value as very high security locks which is demonstrated by unlocking here and here. Per Kwikset rekeying 2004 manual, for a Kwikset lock, there are 5 pins with 6 possible depths. That's 6 to the power of 5 or 7736 possibilities. One can also add two common key profiles (KW1 or Axxess #66) to this combination. Thus, most keys for the Kwikset lock will have about a 1 in 15,552 chance of matching a given lock. However, there are also some other less common profiles, and a small minority also uses 4 pins. If someone happens to have one of those locks with less common profiles and number of less pins, the key will be much less likely to match a random lock. Kwikset smartkey locks have been claimed to be vulnerable to hacking demonstrated by researchers here. Per BSI, in terms of key security, EN 1303 grade 6, a UK standard for the grading of the security of cylinders in locks requires a minimum of six pins and at least 100,000 effective different combinations (that is combinations that are actually inside the range of combinations that are being produced) for their highest security rating of Grade 6. EN 1303 Grade 4 is achieved with five moveable pins and, at minimum, 15,000 effective combinations, but fewer than 30,000 combinations. 

Additionally, this cost is not just for Trump, Melania, and Barron, but also for Trump's adult children and their families: 

On December 7, 2016, Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York City was interviewed by a local TV station. During the interview, de Blasio was asked about these costs: 

However, the CNN article which he references is citing a figure for protecting all of Trump's family (including his adult children and their families) along with Trump himself while he was the President-Elect and living at Trump Tower, not for the cost of protecting Melania alone (or Melania and Barron alone.) Additionally, later statements from the Mayor of New York City indicate that the cost was actually closer to $500,000 per day, not $1 million per day. Furthermore, Melania and Barron living in NYC appears to also be a temporary arrangement until the end of Barron's current school year, not a permanent one. 

November 8 to January 20th is 74 days. $35 million / 74 days is about $473,000 per day. Mr. de Blasio also noted that assuming this would apply to the period after Trump takes office is premature. Snopes is still waiting on getting more up-to-date information: 

Regarding the meme's statement that "conspicuous in their absence are the 3 Muslim countries with which Trump does business": While the meme doesn't explicitly define what it considers to be a "Muslim country," if we define "Muslim countries" to mean "majority-Muslim countries," according to Wikipedia's list of Islam by Country, there are approximately 52 such countries or territories, 45 of which are absent from Department of Homeland Security's list. The three excluded countries listed in the meme are hardly alone among Muslim-majority in being absent from the list, nor is their absence particularly 'conspicuous.' There are a number of other Muslim-majority countries in which terrorism concerns are more widespread than in any of those three countries which are also absent from the list, such as Afghanistan and Pakistan, for example.
