Basically yes. The point that tools like and are not there to provide you with 100% detection rate and malware protection. Even enterprise-class antivirus solutions is likely to fail that - but, from my experience (some of them) are much better than those two. and are here to get you rid of whole bunch of malware - and, believe me, that is a lot of them. The second part of your question is regarding missing of some very well-known malware. Unfortunately, it happens. This is subject of discussion. To me it is shocking that these two fails to detect b374k Shell. But again, it happens and proves that, even if detection rate were 99.9% one should not plan security strategy by relying on quality of antimalware scanner. 

Try with no, of course. (Also, check password scheme. Right now it may be plain text. Try to use any kind of password hashing instead.) 

Usually ESP giants (like Google, Microsoft, Yahoo) are placing here additional info about reasons for rejecting - and even if they don't you know (or you might find out easily) where to go from there. It is important to stress that new IP address is not blacklisted and that before IP change there were regular email traffic between two servers. This has very few resources that might be find just with googling. Does anyone know is this any kind of blacklist on which administrators may request removal and how to do it? Or any other useful resource on subject how to fix this problem. 

Since replaying to received email and sending a new one are the same things in tech terms (only difference are some SMTP headers in sent email) there is only one option left, as far as I see it: low reputation at Microsoft email infrastructure. Microsoft is probably not trusting your emails and makes difference between "new" and response email (which contains important header with ID of mail sent from their side) This lack of trust would be nothing new or unusual - in order to send email to them you have to establish positive reputation, which is long-term job. I suggest you to register your server's IP address to Smart Network Data Services and observe data. 

First, it is a YARA rule, which means that ClamAV has found something it categorizes as malware. "UNOFFICIAL" part means just that ClamAV finding here is "unofficial" and that is the case when detection of malware is result of any non-built-in/default signature. Most probably you are using clamav-unofficial-sigs. What your log entry about is "The Joomla Unserialize Vulnerability" (CVE-2015-8562), a method of utilizing a malicious content in HTTP request. Basically, someone is trying to perform a well-known type of attack to your site. Be sure if you are using Joomla that it is up to date to stay protected. Last but not least, it seems like you have scanned apache's log file and it has found (as you can see attempt yo execute whatever is content of POST http request). Log file itself does not pose security treat in any way. 

Generally speaking, 100gb of logs in indicates that was either not implemented or misconfigured or broken for some reason. Logs in are subject to policies defined in configuration of . I would first look whether it is installed (it should be by default on many distros) and how exactly configured in configuration file - most commonly . Second problem is generation of so many log data. If firewall / iptables-netfilter is suspected search for in output of . Take action accordingly. Your problem may be long time present but never escalated, speaking from my personal experience. 

First, I'm not looking for software for detection of rootkits planted into server, as this may and may not work, especially on live system. I'm curious to find out what would be the signs of rootkit takeover of one server. At least what damage and externally - detectable behavior one could expect and witness while it is happening? My idea - maybe wrong - is that if you cannot detect compromise of system via tools like , , (which would, by definition, be tampered) you could, perhaps be assured that system is rooted by: 

not to check outbound email traffic at all - that highly depend on your Postfix configuration, to be more specific the way email is passed to binary use spamassassin whitelist options 

emails sent with PHP, in particular case PHPMailer (non-smtp submitted, ordinary PHP ) are signed incorrectly. I have heard about phpMailDomainSigner, which is kind of hack approach, and I would like to solve this at the top - MTA / milter level if possible. Here are: /etc/opendkim.conf 

My () over some (variable) period of time comes to unusual system resources utilization. I'm positive that I don't have that amount of traffic and dos/ddos are pretty much out of list because no web server restart can do anything to dos/ddos. What are the symptoms? System load ( command) shows - - . On 8 core machine, usual load never goes above unless something other happens, often it is - . command proves is the one to blame. Why I'm making big deal about tolerable system load? It seems like disk I/O is also increased (temperature 2-3 celsius up), I would rather to avoid this bacause both hdd's are several years old. And I don't know where is this going. Configuration file (large comments stripped): 

Generally speaking, headers are first to forge by spammers. You might have more than one headers in the received messages. At least one of them should contain correct . What you probably want is rejecting forged messages. Aside from setting up to mark such messages as spam, quickest and easiest way to get rid of most of the spam messages (or, at least large number of them) is to reject hosts that are known to forge addresses and that do it repeatedly by using public DNSBL's. When speaking of Postfix, you do that by editing and modifying in such manner: 

Let's say I want to set limit of 200 messages per hour. Desired behavior is that 201 message holds until one hour period is over in order to be delivered. I would be really amazed if solution to this could respect my previously set per-domain rate limits: 

As you see, there is a lot to check and eliminate as possible cause. By the way "System mail name" should not be but - check the facts about fully qualified domain name. 

How do you set up automatic email forwarding based on conditions like: forward if from emailaccount@domain.tld forward if from domain is domain.tld forward if subject contains word 'Urgent' and so. I'm only able to forward (redirect) all emails from one mailbox to certain email address. 

From link you provided, it looks like you're being hacked by WSO malware. You may attempt to remove malware with tools like Linux Malware Detect or ClamAV or ClamAV with extended, unofficial signatures, and you will have more or less success, but only way to be certain the malware is gone is to wipe everything and restore from backup. I hope you have backup. You may want to read this very informative Q&a about your problem - how to deal with compromised server. Good luck. 

Answer is no. I state this mostly because I'm aware that there are hard to imagine number of people with more experience in all aspects of being ESP admin than me and yet I run dozen of production email systems that qualifies as "small" without presented problems. From what you have posted it looks like you have taught of everything and, presumed you have properly implemented what is listed, there is only one option left - that your IP address has done bad things in it's past life. I mean (really) bad. Your IP address may be pulled from public blacklists at the ISP's initiative (which is vastly more efficient) but before that served virus and phishing traffic repeatedly for a prolonged period of time. If that is the case, unfortunately there is little that can be done, to my best knowledge. One option is to remain in attempt to maintain legitimate email server for a long time, paying the price of many emails being rejected before sender reputation - completely different thing to being present or not on public blacklists - is slowly established. Please keep us informed about your case.
