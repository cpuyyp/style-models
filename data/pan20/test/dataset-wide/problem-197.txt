Since you say this art will be applied with magic, that opens up a lot of options that aren't available in real-life examples of cultural tattoos. You could make ones that move, sparkle, emit an aura, make a smell or sound, change with the weather or mood, or dozens of other things. This could make counterfeiting harder and allow for the markings to be a genuine status symbol. For the children example, a woman could get a magical tattoo symbolizing the number of children she has and as she has more it could automatically update. And for ones that automatically update, it would make keeping certain secrets impossible. Also I have read many stories with "soulmate tattoos". It is kind of an overdone trope, but in the right context you could use something like that. And as in other answers the more complex the tattoo the more expensive it is, the wealthier the person wearing it. Or it could be the opposite. What if everyone was born with them, and the only people who could afford to erase them were the rich and powerful. None of the other answers focused on the magical aspect, so it seemed good to point out your options in that regard. Edit: Another thought it utility tattoos. Since they are magical you could make ones that tell time, or can be used to cast a certain spell. For instance in Fullmetal Alchemist, many characters had tattoos that they used to activate a certain power (I know that was meant to be pseudo-scientific). 

What if the god you talk about needs sacrifices to summon them? They only appear to create more beings when x amount of blood has been spilt. So to avoid extinction by the occasional accident or starvation, they have to fight to bring their god back. If they are good at it, they will grow the population every time they bring the god back, if they are bad they will head towards extinction faster. There could also be other incentives for bringing the god back. Like maybe everyone who dies only goes to the after life if the god comes back to take them there. So Tom trips and falls off a cliff, now his entire people go to war to to bring the god back so Tom can go to heaven. It's a silly example, but hopefully you get the idea. 

Although there are physical relationships between frequencies, that isn't music. Scales aren't music either.. western music is very advanced, tonally and harmonically, but that's just one aspect of it. Perhaps aliens would listen to complicated patterns of clicking sounds and appreciate 35/36 polyrhymic patterns. Or just random clicking, attempting to not have patterns. Or perhaps just the same beeping noise over and over, only at subtly different volume levels, which convey meaning to them... Maybe their music is made by dragging their claws along a blackboard, with the emotional content determined by how long the music goes on for, with masterpieces resulting in the musician wearing their claws down to stubs and replacement blackboards. I think its foolish to try to even define our earthly music, nevermind opening the field to aliens, and if we do, my bet is that if we can even recognize it, it'll not have any qualities which we can appreciate as music. But if they do make music, I hope it sounds like this: $URL$ 

Colonies will require tremendous amounts of resources and money and support from earth, until they become self sustaining. They will likely need to produce/mine some resource thats rare on earth to trade with. Trade will be very limited due to cost, meaning the colonies will be utterly impoverished and lacking in basically everything, and may never get out of 3rd world abject poverty situation. 

Chemical warfare... Swim over the enemy location and drop containers on them which burst and pollute their water with poisonous chemicals. If you could locate yourself in a current upstream of your enemy you could just release poison chemicals. Might be useful as defence. 

If the planet is tidally locked to the star (I'm not sure that's possible, but let's assume it is), then not only is it day all the time, but the position of the sun will be fixed in the sky. This results in 

For your story: Because the largest has no peer competitor. While no government has a profit motive to keep things lean (well, relatively lean), all of the others exist within a spectrum of large to small, and they feel competitive pressures. Also, the smaller countries can focus, specialize, whereas the single largest will try to be the best at everything -- in some ways, it has to. A smaller country who makes the best X may not be able to scale solutions to the largest, and the largest is unwilling to accept not being the best. So hopefully, that presents a structural rationale, along the lines of your question. The abilities, skills, and drive that allowed that nation to rise to prominence are not the same required to operate at the top. It seems that they must either seek open hegemony or accept decline. 

Yes, and the answer is nearby glaciation. I checked the links you provided to refresh myself on the difficulties. Therefore, pardon me for doing more answering than explaining -- tell me if you think this works. Non-arid means it has water and presumably plants to hold topsoil etc. Lower and presumably hotter than its environs means evaporation plays a key role. Salt does not evaporate with water and means that plants won't grow and soil won't stay. The only way to avoid salt without plants, water, and soil is going to be ridiculous (and skilled) winds, leaving only rocks, which is not what you are looking for. Water must be replenished and there must be a source which does not increase salinity. Surrounding, or bordering on one side, and at higher altitude, a glacier can provide a fairly consistent source of fresh water -- consistent in decades or hundreds of years. That's long enough to build a civilization. You could even have the glacier irrigate most of your basin, and let the runoff with its accumulated continental salts collect in a deeper and hotter segment of the basin. Let "Death Valley" have its own salinity crisis -- now we have a locally complete water cycle. Interestingly and poignantly (if unfairly) for SF terms, the salinity crisis could be a growing problem which must be confronted by the locals, only for them to be wiped out by a saltwater flood as the dam is breached. When it rains, it pours. When it doesn't rain, it's worse. 

It looks structurally unsound to me. Too much stress on the cross members, difficult to see where the center of gravity is, annoying to go from one tower to the other. Consider that the different ends of the station are in (slightly) different orbits. This causes them to want to move closer or move apart, imposing structural stresses. This occurs even on the ISS, causing it to creak and flex. A space station of Sevastopols size would probably be approximately spherical, to get the maximum volume and structural strength from the minimum of materials. Plus curves hold in the pressure better than sharp angles. If the station will spin, to provide artifical gravity, then a cylinder shape is better, putting living areas on the outside, with the central, micro-g environment given over to docking ports and logistics. 

The only time anything unpowered leaving the surface with a single impulse can get to an orbit above an atmosphere, is if it is hit by something else when near its apoapsis, providing the second impulse and accelerating it in the prograde direction (so it gets rear ended, speeding it up in the direction it is travelling). It is theorized that a load of melted rocks were blasted out from earth in a gigantic collision, and they bumped each other, forming orbits, which coalesced into the moon, eventually, and anything that didn't get bumped just right rained back down. TL;DR: You can't get something into orbit by throwing it. Orbital mechanics says no. This is unfortunate, because if you can get to a stable orbit, you have all the time in the universe to deploy a solar sail and eventually float away somewhere else. You CAN however, break free entirely, with nothing more than brute force. You just need to somehow survive getting through the atmosphere at speeds higher than escape velocity. This will mean burning up, like a shooting star in reverse, but given sufficient ablative protection, it may be possible. Escape velocity, at ground level, is Mach 33 (12km per second), but that speed will decrease rapidly due to friction and drag forces, so the actual launch would need to be much, much faster indeed. It would require much greater sums of energy than rocket launches, since its very inefficient. But as long as the projectile gets through the atmosphere above 12km/s it will fly off into an orbit around the sun. And that's in theory enough to make it to any point in the solar system and beyond, given aeons of time and the right gravity assists. 

I'd like to consider the logistics of the Arks and some of the special circumstances not covered in other answers. -What about people who can't move themselves? From the description it seems that when you reappear in the Ark you are compelled to leave, but what if you are paralyzed and that wasn't cured by the Ark, or if you are a baby too young to crawl? Are you magically transported out or do others who have been reborn need to help you? -There would need to be a system in place to manage those coming out of the Ark who can't get themselves back to where they came from or who have nowhere to go. (i.e. children, people with dementia or amnesia, the elderly, etc.) This could be a government refugee camp type of thing. -I imagine there would be many who take the Arks as proof of God. This could have many implications including an uptick in religiousness, and fighting over the Arks. On the other hand if everyone regardless of faith could come from any Ark, it could cause people to realize we are all the same and no one faith should control them. -It would probably be common for families to travel to the Ark you are expected to appear at to wait for you to come out. That could lead to a whole industry around housing those families while they wait. Trying to encourage tourism that way: "Oh you are already in this area, why not make it a vacation?" It would boost the economy in places where Arks appeared. There would also probably be rebirth celebrations and second birthday cards in drug stores. -People may want to keep rebirth confidential because if everyone knows you only have one life left, someone might decide to murder you. If they do there could be privacy laws about the area around the Ark and the intake centers, no cameras and records fall under HIPPA. -I know someone else said death cults wouldn't become a thing, but why not? There are certain religions that refer to baptism as a rebirth, maybe they take that literally and when someone converts they are killed and reborn into the new religion. This could become illegal. -Because Arks appeared suddenly and without cause there could also be those who consider it unnatural. Maybe another religion forces their members to loose their first life when they are indoctrinated because "God only intended you to have one life." -I could see celebrities using up a life as a publicity stunt. -What about people who arrive at the Ark with nothing? Say a family gets in a car accident and only the children get reborn? Someone at the Ark is going to have to handle that. -Also how old do you need to be to allow rebirth. I'm thinking along the lines of infants and premies. Do you have to have been fully born to allow a second chance? What if a child dies during birth or a C-section, will it come back? If this line is fuzzy that could lead to parents waiting at Arks not knowing if the baby will emerge. If a premie dies will it come out of the Ark healthy and bigger? If so you might find parents letting a premature baby die so that it will come back healthier. -In video games everyone would start with at least two lives. -You know how there are always people who says stuff like "You'll understand when you are older"? Well expect to start have your opinions invalidated with: "You don't understand because you're not on your second life." This is getting long so I'll stop now. But the point is that there are dozens of cultural changes that don't have to do with murder and capital punishment. 

The moat could be part of a river system, and have a strong current. Imagine a castle built on a small rocky outcrop in the middle of a fast flowing river. With appropriate stonework the river could be channeled around each side of the castle and have a strong and deep current, enough to sweep attackers bodies away. 

Religious beliefs can explain just about anything. Perhaps the idea of using oil (the product of decomposed plants and animals) is abhorrent. 

It could take thousands of generations, it might never happen. It doesn't matter much what happens to your body during your lifetime... those changes are not written into your DNA; which is the only thing passed on to your offspring. So even if you work out all day every day and become a bodybuilder, just like your father did, and just like our grandfather, there's absolutely no chance that your son will have an easier time of it. My favorite example of this is that jews have been cutting off their foreskin for hundreds and hundreds of generations, yet each new generation just stubbornly gets born with foreskin again. And again. And again. To make a genetic change requires a mutation, which is a random event. And in your case, probably very many mutations to make a stocky, muscled human with an advanced heart and circulatory system which can thrive in the increased gravity. Even if you breed any mutations that do occur, like the pedigree of a prized stallion, it could take forever as you wait for all the mutations you want/need to occur by chance. Unfortunately, such a breeding program is the best case scenario, too. Modern humans have so much exogenetic factors that genetic mutations contribute almost nothing to our survival chances. We're born helpless and useless and underdeveloped, just to support our big brain. Because the brain learns culture and society, and culture and society improve your chances of survival more than muscles. (at least it did for many generations. The last few seem to have gotten more stupid). Survival of the fittest is also survival of the most attractive, so even in the very unlikely event that all the right mutations take place, maybe your first squat, muscled, no-necked barrel chested dwarves are technically better suited for 1.5g, but they just aren't hot enough to pull some chicks.
