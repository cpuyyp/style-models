Fig 3: source Now, the Cobb-Douglas utility function doesn't solve everything, as it imposes certain constraints by construction. For example, the line that goes from the origin through all the curves (the expansion path) is 45° and straight by construction: it cannot be changed. This means that as you get richer (even infintely rich), your preferences over this goods remains constant. The formal name is homotheticity or homothetic preferences. This is empirically false, as it has been shown that the richer you are, you use a smaller share of your income for food. With Cobb-Douglas preferences, this cannot happen. Translog preferences relaxes this assumption. In the next figure, you have a utility map relaxing the homotheticity assumption: 

You are correct in pointing out the flaws of GDP. But honestly, it's the best we have came up with; measuring the stock of wealth is just impossible. You say you can estimate the value of your own assets, and of course it seems that way. We all feel that way, until we actually try. How much is your cellphone worth? Easy to know, go to ebay and look for similar phones in similar conditions and you get a price for that phone, right? Why don't we do that for all the country's cellphones? Well, because if we put all the cellphones in the market prices would drop down dramatically. Now, we're not obviously sending all the cellphones to the market, we just want to know how much its value is, but the point is that in order to have an estimation, we have to make assumptions regarding the market. The value of one cellphone is easy to calculate because it doesn't really affect the market. Additionally, who says that you have to sell it in your local market? Why don't you offer it in Australia or Japan or Algeria or wherever the price is higher? And why not sell it another day when the price is up? The same goes for your car, house, computer, clothes, books, etc. Think now of your financial assets. You can know that, right? All one needs to do is see what the bank says, and it says that my investment portfolio is worth \$100.... at least today... and exactly at the time I checked. But remember: the value of any financial portfolio is going up and down with high volatility even in the same day. Now try to figure out the value of the financial assets of all the country. Well, you can do that. But again: just today, and just at the time you checked. Even though it doesn't seem like it, the same goes for goods. Take oil. Say that there is an oil reserve with x millions of barrels just waiting to be extracted and sent out to the market. How much is the value of that reserve? It depends on when you ask, whom you ask to, and who else is asking the same question (other sellers). What about gold? silver? copper? coal? wood? You can estimate a value in a given time, but that can be very different in another time. What about land? Well, if I sow corn it will give me a given amount, but if I sow rice it will yield a different amount. Besides, would it be the same if my neighbor sows corn and I sow rice than if we both sow the same (competition)? What if I want to use it to generate electricity instead of growing food? Or what if I use it for livestock? What if I sell it? What if we all decide to do the same thing at the same time? Or what if we decide to do completely different things? Indeed to value farm land, you have to assume what use will it have. Infrastructure is even more complicated. How much is a railroad valued? And what does value even mean in this context? There is no secondary market for railroads is there? There are opportunity costs, though. And we have the construction value too. But the we would have to make assumptions on its depreciation, and say how much of the revenue of the country is due to this specific segment of the railroad. To estimate this, one has to say how much the country would loss was the railroad not there (which is a fictitious value). What about parks? Don't even get me started on natural resources (rivers, lakes, coast, jungles, biodiversity, etc). But even then, those are the easy ones. We still have left education, experience, skills and the like. But this post is long already, the point has been made and now I have a headache for thinking all this. Indeed, there are many serious and very clever attempts to make estimations of these. But they are used to answer very specific questions. GDP, on the other hand is easy: just sum all the sells of goods and services. We (economists) don't like it very much either, but that's all we have. Just try to accept it, and don't take it to seriously. 

The translog function can be used not only in preferences but also in production and cost functions. I am not very familiar with its implications in consumer theory, but from the production point of view, i've seen it widely used. The Translog Function doesn't impose additivity and homogeneity, and hence Constant Elasticity of Substitution. This is interesting because it doesn't require a "smooth" substitution among the inputs (in production analysis). I guess that in consumer theory the interpretation would be similar. So basically, the translog function is less restrictive than a cobb-douglas. If you impose some restrictions while calculating the translog function parameters, you get a cobb-douglas function. That is why it is a "generalization". In other words, the cobb-douglas is a specific case of the Translog function imposing additivity and homogeneity (i.e. imposing constant elasticity of substitution). 

Fig 4: source Think of this graph as good y being food and good x being entertainment. As you get richer (or farther from the origin), you will destin more of your income to entertainment. Finally, i will talk about the Elasticity of Substitution which is known as $\sigma$ (sigma) which can be imagined as being the curvature of the indifference curve. In the Fig 1, the perfect complements $\sigma = 0$: No curvature. In the perfect substitutes, $\sigma = infinity$: straigt line. In Cobb-Douglas, $\sigma = 1$: a slight curvature. Nonetheless, as you get richer (distant to the origin), this Elasticity of substitution remain constant in the three settings. Even in the non homothetic preferences seen in Fig 4, the elasticity of substitution remains constant. These are the **Constant Elasticity of Substitution (CES)**preferences. But what if you allow the curve to have different shapes as you get richer? Look at Fig 5: 

Fig 1: source This setting is known as "complements". Because as you can see, adding one thousand units of good x (that is moving to the right), without adding good y (that is not move upwards) does not make you happier: you move along the indifference curve. Think of this as the left shoe and the right shoe. It is useless to have a thousand additional left shoes without adding a right shoe because they are perfect complements. Now, look at this one: 

Edit: i added more info to reply your comment. I think that the other reply is more complete than mine. But i'm just going to add something i consider useful for you to have a broader understanding. I assume that you're familiar with indifference curves. I refer you to this site (from where i took the graphs), in case you're not. An indifference curve is just a mapping of all the combinations of two (or more) goods that give you the same utility, or "make you happy at the same level". First, see this indifference curve: 

Depreciation is the loss in value of something. Take the car example. When you buy the car, it is worth 5000 dollars. Your net worth equals the value of the car: 5000 dollars. If you needed to use the money, you could just re-sell the car and you'd get \$5,000 (in theory). But what about the second year? You are technically still worth \$5,000. But if you try to sell the car, nobody would buy it after you used it for one full year at the same price: the car lost part of its value. In a perfect world, the car would lose \$500 because since you can use it for ten years max, and you used a tenth of that. Thus, the car would sell at \$4,500. From then on, the same keeps happening: the car losses 10% of its value each year, until the tenth year when it becomes valueless (at least in this perfect world). This periodic fall in value is called depreciation. When calculating the GDP, the government sums all the goods and services consumed in a given year regardless of its depreciation. If you purchased the car on January 1st, then the GDP increses by \$5,000. The government will most certainly publish the country's gdp by the end of the year. Although the car lost some of its value during that period, this is not taken into account in the GDP. If you took away the depreciation, then it would be the NDP (Net Domestic Product). The depreciation is also known as "capital consumption" for a simple reason. Imagine that you want to have the same value (in cars) all your life. To achieve this, you would have to save \$500 each year to replace your car every 10 years. So, you could say that each year, you consume \$500 worth in cars. This is obviously not true, but it is a way of simplifying it. 

Autocorrelated is the opposite of independent, which is a term easier to understand (and explain). If you throw one die, the probability of getting the number any number is 1/6. If you throw it again, the probability of guessing the result number is 1/6. If you do it again and again and again the probability of getting it right is always 1/6 (provided that the die is «fair»). This means that the next outcome is independent to the previous one. Whether you get a 3 or a 5, the outcome of the next «experiment» is not affected. The opposite would be, for instance, if you have a set of 20 cards, and then you draw one, the probability that the card drawn is the one you predicted is 1/20th. But this time, things have changed: you are left with only 19 cards on your hand. So the next time, you have a probability of 1/19th of guessing the card. If you do it again and again the probability of guessing the next card is greater. Since the outcome of the previous event helps to predict the next one, we say that this process is autocorrelated. One doesn't need to be an expert on statistics to see that these two examples are different. This is why it is important. Now, when it comes to prices, it simply means that the price of a good today helps predicting its price for tomorrow. Take currencies: If 1€ = USD \$1.1193 today, it would be very unlikely (but never impossible) that 1€ = USD \$10 tomorrow. It is more likely that the price will be around USD \$1.1193.
