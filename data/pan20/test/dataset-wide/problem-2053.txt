Looking forward to hear from you soon. Thanks. Note: Best of the best is hired and client makes sure itself. 

In countries like Pakistan, there are companies which do project-based hiring and as soon as projects are finished, so are the jobs. Process of hiring: 

I was recently approached via linked-in from a company manager. He asked one of my contacts to introduce him to me on LinkedIn. I am currently working as Technical Java Architect. Then He told me that he has a senior Java/JavaEE developer position. If you are interested, we can have a Skype interview. Shouldn't I ask for more details about the role and salary and benefits too to decide should I apply there or not. So for that purpose, what would be most appropriate text/question formation to ask more about my role, salary and other benefits. Thanks. 

I would say that piece of wisdom applies more to typical IT shops than to software companies. The typical situation is an IT shop at a company that makes widgets, and has some software that is a "cost center." They want to have a base of employees who can support their systems, and aren't terribly likely to move any time soon. Occasionally, they will have projects where they will need to ramp up their staff or acquire a specific skill set. Or they may like to have a "buffer" if they need to cut expenses fast without risking the hassle of laying off employees. In this case, the typical contractor will be making more than the typical employee. The trade-off is for stability. If there are budget cuts, the contractor will likely go before the employee. On the other side, the employees' skills are likely more localized and domain-specific than the contractors', so they may not have as much leverage to negotiate raises, etc. Again, there are exceptions, but I think this is a rough picture at your typical IT shop. -- For companies, that make software as their main business, the model is a little different. They want talent, and are probably willing to pay for it, and may not be as concerned as an IT shop about costs, so they're working off a different model. 

I wanted to know how to deal and negotiate with new employer regarding joining date and required leaves few days after joining. I tried all i can with my current employer to not get notice period extended but now it seems to get the relieving letter and F&F, etc i have to serve extended days and also for easy transition of work handover. Current notice period is 2months. Extension is of 10 days. Problem 1: If i get relieved under extended notice days then i would get no break between job change and have to join from next working days. I had given tentative dates keeping buffer days for getting break but seems my notice period has gone even ahead of the kept buffer period. Problem 2: I will need two leaves after joining new company within next 2 weeks for exams of distance learning program i am pursuing ( they already they know about my pursuance but not about upcoming exam of the course and i came to know the schedule of exam today itself) Update regarding extension of notice period The key person who had to conclude exit date was busy in his personal matters and then in other projects under company. Now after almost 20 days of putting letter he has concluded after my repeated attempts to get Exit date. Background story 10 months before company did some technology certification for three employees due to cost incurred company got certified employee sign bonds of 12 months but i was exempted from signing bond somehow (Due to reason HR or gods knows). Note that I was promoted for going for certification at last minute because one person was not well and was hospitalised. As i am leaving and having not signed bond but implied bond period to other two employees, my manager is asking for extension to compensate a bit and ignoring the reality. Might be manager is thinking that my future employer withdraw the offer due extension in notice period and so that he can retain me for few more months. Also note that my current employer asked for 3months +2 months notice due to bond things explained above but now settled for 10 days extension but with no fixed assurance on exit date even after sharing KT plans and past experience of new team member's KT. Update New job location is in different city so there is some relocation stuff also involved. 

Assuming these are all legitimate mistakes that are the fault of the employees and not the process, a system of peer accountability seems be in order. If you have a regular meeting with the employees to review tickets (e.g. projecting them on the whiteboard), and point out if they have not been updated in a regular enough time. If you have regular stand-up meetings, where the root cause of a problem repeatedly comes down to a certain developer forgetting a semicolon, that should be embarrassing to the programmer and provide the incentive him to change. I don't like meetings anymore than anyone else, but making the team members accountable to each other for results and their performance in following through with certain things will in most cases make them more likely to do it. 

Let's make it even less malevolent. Let's say that at hour 39.5 of your week you discover a bug that you have released into a production system that, if unaddresed, would result in some big cost to your company. Nobody is around to approve your overtime. Of course, you would work to at least stop the bleeding from the bug,even if it took you over your allotted hours. But I would then approach the PM at the client and explain that I had worked an extra several hours, and ask how we should approach it, even though it's "my fault." And if he expected me to eat the hours, it would lead me to reconsider if this is a place I want to work much longer. 

I am going through same thing, if I tell you for which company I am being contacted, you won't believe, It's from US. They have also development office here, but they never contacted my because of politics and social class differences. I have applied a few times, but never heard from them, but getting hired from their head-office is kind a sad. Anyways what do you think, should I be part of this lie? Don't you think that fortune 500 company is responsible for all this? why don't they hire from their Pakistani software office? I wonder if they know how candidate is selected and that lie, which i told you about. I am just proceeding how it all happens and not much interested. I would be if they would have giving me a chance in their own company and I would be really proud. Questions: 

Disclaimer: I am the type of person who will take public transportation even when told explicitly that taking a cab is acceptable because I tend to be frugal and sort of enjoy the sense of adventure. This is probably not the norm. From my perspective, this is what I would conclude from each of the items, if I got word a candidate had submitted those expenses: 

I would say that once you have established yourself in your career (with a few notable exceptions) where you went to college will not count against you. On the other side, I was lucky to have attended a college with a good reputation, that have had several alumni in decision-making positions in the town in which it was situated. It would not be completely honest of me to claim that having the name of the university on my resume didn't mean it got a more generous look than it would have otherwise, and that this never meant the difference between me getting past a certain level of screening and not. I have even been told before an interview that a manager likes graduates of my school. It really shouldn't matter, and I really would like to be able to say that it doesn't matter. But that's not entirely how the world works with human beings. A hiring manager is more likely to trust someone from his alma mater or a similar school than one that he doesn't know. 

I had got good salary offer and position from this MNC company from different city than I'm in currently. However I got Counteroffer + Retention Bonus from my current employer and I have taken the decision to stay here. Reason of holding back with current employer is because I have lot of job hops in my resume (No of years = No of job hops) also I'm comfortable staying with the current employer. But I'm confused that how should I approach new employer to inform this decision without burning bridge with this new employer and Should I inform thru email and wait for them to notice OR call the HR inform him and then formally tell the same on email? Just for information if this matters, we have 2 months of notice period in my region and it's been 20 days since I have accepted the offer. 

My best advice is to accept that you will have some days that are better than others, and not beat yourself over it. In various sports, even the best players go into "slumps" -- times when their performance is far below their usual standards. For the few that don't, I suspect it is more an inherent quality than execution of a strategy for avoiding it. That being said, if you notice you're in a slump, it's probably a cue to break up your routine. If the last time you've hit "compile" you have a page-full of compile errors from typos, it's probably time to take a walk or maybe pick up a non-coding task for a while. Trying to grind through it is likely only going to produce similar results. More important that avoiding bad days is not letting bad days dominate your vision of yourself (or those around you). You (I suspect) are a good developer who occasionally has bad days, not a bad developer. You have this in common with almost everyone else in the world.
