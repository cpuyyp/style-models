Hi Dick, I don't know if there is one or another way to give a formal meaning to this formula, but I understand it this way: We have the identity $\det[X\ Y\ Z] = \langle X, Y \times Z\rangle$, where the brackets denotes the scalar product. So, $Y \times Z = \sum_{i=1}^3 \langle e_i, Y \times Z \rangle e_i = \sum_{i=1}^3 \det[e_i \ Y\ Z]e_i$, where $e_i$ are the vectors of the canonical basis, which is your formula, I think. -- Note: It seems to be the same remark as Deane Yang's 

Form any closed 1-form $\alpha$ on a diffeological space $X$, if the group of periods $$ P_\alpha = \left\{\int_\ell \alpha \ \left\vert\right. \ \ell \in {\rm Loops}(X)\right\} $$ is diffeologically discrete, that is in this case, a strict subgroup of $\bf R$ (what always happen for second-countable manifolds) then there exists a smooth map $f : X \to T_\alpha = {\bf R}/P_\alpha$ such that $f^*(\theta) = \alpha$, where $\theta$ is the canonical 1-form on $T_\alpha$. For a closed 2-form $\omega$ on X, what we can do is the following. Assume first that $X$ is simply connected. Let $\alpha = K\omega$, where $K$ is the chain-homotopy operator(${}^1$), $K\omega$ is a 1-form on ${\rm Paths}(X)$. Restricted to ${\rm Loops}(X)$, $K\omega$ is closed. The group of periods of $\omega$ is defined as the group of periods of $\alpha \restriction {\rm Loops}(X)$, that is, $$ P_\omega = \left\{\int_\ell K\omega \ \left\vert\right. \ \ell \in {\rm Loops}({\rm Paths}(X))\right\}. $$ Now, if $P_\omega$ is diffeologically discrete then there exists a principal $T_\omega$ fiber bundle over $X$ with a connexion $\lambda$ of curvature $\omega$. You can say that this is the smooth geometric representation of $\omega$ you look for. As above, the condition of discretion is satisfied by any second-countable manifold. This construction is unique up to equivalence. If $X$ is not simply connected, these geometric representations (fiber bundles + connexion) are classified by $H^1(X,T_\omega)$. The principal bundles only are classified, up to equivalence, by ${\rm Ext}(\pi_1(X),P_\omega)$(${}^2$). 

After reflexion, I think I will reduce my contribution to this: Don't think too much about the book you want to write, just write it down. Don't wait that everything is perfect, just begin. Anyway, it will take years. 

In Cartan calculus, integrating a $k$-differential form $\alpha$ on a $k$-cubic chain $\sigma$ doesn't need more than the Riemann integral: $$ \int_\sigma \alpha := \sum_{i=1}^N c_i \int_{I^k}\sigma_i^*(\alpha) = \sum_{i=1}^N c_i \int_0^1dx_1 \cdots \int_0^1dx_k f(x_1,\ldots,x_k) $$ where the $\sigma_i$ are standard smooth cubes and $$ \sigma = \sum_{i=1}^N c_i \sigma_i \mbox{ and } f(x_1,\ldots,x_k) = \sigma_i^*(\alpha)_x(e_1,\ldots,e_k) $$ And with that you can do a lot already if not almost everything: Stokes' theorem, Cartan formulae, variation of integral of forms on chains (variation calculus) etc. (It is BTW what I used to extend Cartan calculus to diffeology, where there is no Lebesgue measure). Of course, differential calculus is not integration theory. But I would not over-teach and use tools where they are far beyond the needs. So the choice depends, as usual, on our goal :) P.S. By the way Dieudonné is not the example I would take for a course, if his books can be regarded as references, his pedagogy can be used for the definition of infinitesimal ;-) 

There is a ambiguity about orbifold homotopy, depending of the category you consider. Regarded as a diffeological space — see Orbifold as Diffeology — and considering the general homotopy theory of diffeological spaces. This will give you, for the classical example ${\cal O}_m = {\bf R}^2/{\bf Z}_m$, the trivial homotopy, since ${\cal O}_m$ is smoothly contractible. But you can get a refinement by looking at the principal orbit of ${\rm Diff}({\cal O}_m)$ acting on ${\cal O}_m$ itself, which is ${\cal O}_m - \{0\}$. Contrarily to manifolds where the group of diffeomorphisms is transitive, the lack of transitivity of the group of diffeomorphisms for orbifolds (the structure groups of an orbifold are diffeological invariants) gives you a family of homotopy groups in each degree, one for each orbit, and especially for the principal orbit. I don't really looked how the homotopy for diffeological orbifolds, or the homotopy of the orbits of the group of diffeomorphisms, and the structure groups of the orbifolds (here ${\bf Z}_m$ at the origin) are related, but it has its own logic and it is a diffeological invariant (I consider only what is called "effective orbifolds"). I'm not sure I answer the question, but it may give some directions to dig in. Note that, the singularities of a diffeological space are defined by the orbits of the group of diffeomorphisms, so this homotopy described above for orbifolds is a specialization of the general case. 

I think there are some theorems which are easier to prove in the diffeological framework, or as you say: for which the proof reveals more conceptual reasons. For example this one ? Proposition Let $X$ be a connected diffeological space, let $\omega$ be a closed 2-form on $X$. Let $P_\omega \subset {\bf R}$ be its group of periods. If the group of periods $P_\omega$ is (diffeologically) discrete (that is, is a strict subgroup of $\bf R$) then there exists a family of non-equivalent principal fiber bundles $\pi : Y \to X$, with structure group the torus of periods $T_\omega = {\rm R} / P_\omega$, equipped with a connexion form $\lambda$ of curvature $\omega$. This family is indexed by the extension group ${\rm Ext}({\rm Ab}(\pi_1(X)), P_\omega)$. This theorem is a generalization of the classical construction of the prequantization bundle of an integral symplectic (or pre-symplectic) manifold, that is the ones for which $P_\omega = a {\bf Z}$. Why such a generalization is interesting? Well, here are some comments: 1) The only condition for the existence of such "integration structures" is that the group of periods is diffeologically discrete, which is hidden in the classical construction by some technical hypothesis (countable at infinity or analog statements). 2) The space $Y$ is a quotient of the space ${\rm Paths}(X)$ on which the form $\omega$ is lifted modulo the action of a "Chain-Homotopy" operator (actually what is built by quotient is a groupoid and the bundle $Y$ is just the "half-groupoid"). So, the diffeological space ${\rm Paths}(X)$ is a master piece of this construction (but almost everywhere in diffeology), and the fact that diffeological spaces support differential forms (in particular ${\rm Paths}(X)$) with the whole tools of Cartan calculus is fundamental. 3) The generality of this theorem involve essentially "irrational tori", since in general the quotient $T_\omega$ is of course not a Lie group. The last point illustrates why irrational tori are important in diffeology: or you accept these objects or you give up this (kind of) theorems. You may note that such a theorem doesn't exists in the restricted category of Frölicher spaces since irrational tori are trivial there. You may be happy with just the integral case, but in my opinion you miss a lot by not taking the whole generality of the construction, and putting fences where they do not exist. I may give some other examples where diffeology give a shortcut for known classical theorems, and by the way extend them to objects which do not belong to the category of manifolds. 

For a Minkowski space $M^n$ the dimension of the null geodesics is $2n-3$. It is naturally a contact manifold (for general Lorentzian space in general relativity you need a condition for the space of geodesics to be a manifold, but that's another story). This is how you can see it: consider the space of all parametrized geodesics in $M^n$, that is the space of curves $t \mapsto x + tv$, this space is equivalent to $TM$ ($x$ and $v$), dimension $2n$. Now identify two lines $c : t \mapsto x + tv$ and $c' : t \mapsto x' + tv'$ having the same trajectory, that is the same image $\{x+tv \mid t \in {\bf R}\}$, that gives you the space of un-parametrized geodesics. But two such lines have the same image iff $c'(t) = c(at+b)$ where $a \in {\bf R}$ and $a \neq 0$ and $b \in {\bf R}$. Thus these un-parametrized geodesics are the orbits of the affine group ${\rm Aff}({\bf R})$. That gives you $x'=x+bv$ and $v' = av$. The quotient $TM/{\rm Aff}({\bf R})$ is equivalent to $TS^{n-1}$. Now in $TM$ the space of null geodesics is the $2n-1$ subspace defined by $v \cdot v = 0$ (hypersurface), the affine group acts on this subspace, and its action is still free, then the dimension of your quotient, the space of null un-parametrized geodesics, is $2n-3$. And indeed for $n=4$ you get 5, what you were looking for. P.S. Long time ago, I wrote a small text on this construction that I never published. But I recently put it on line. It was a letter to a colleague of mine. You can find the manuscript here 

I work on paper notebook with a pencil (I put date here and there as markers). When something is ok I write a small paper (in TeX) with most of the details. Sometimes I publish it. I put everything valuable on my website (published or not). When a notebook is finished I add it to the pile and buy another notebook, pencils are not a problem, I buy them by ten. And, yes, I have also one or two pencil sharpeners. Works well for me :-) 

This is a partial answer to what I understand from the question: "...for n=1 we have the "Albanese" map from M into a circle, given by the integration of this form. Can we do something similar for n>1?". The problem with the classical approaches is that, when you can represent a closed differential form it's only when the form is integral (in particular above, in the case you mentioned). The reason is that, for a closed form $\alpha$, the torus of periods $T_\alpha$, that is, quotient of $\bf R$ by the group of periods $P_\alpha$, is a manifold only when $P_\alpha = a {\bf Z}$, $a \in {\bf R}$. In other words, the manifold framework authorize you to represent only integral cohomology. That difficulty can be resolved by working in the category of diffeological spaces, because $T_\alpha$ is legit in this category. You can show that: 

Here is an example of a more conventional theorem: the homotopic invariance of De Rham cohomology. Differential forms and De Rham cohomology are well defined concept in diffeology, they apply in particular on space of paths of diffeological spaces, spaces of smooth maps, quotients etc. We use here the Chain-Homotopy operator $$ K : \Omega^p(X) \to \Omega^{p-1}({\rm Paths}(X)) \quad \mbox{which satisfies} \quad K \circ d + d \circ K = \hat 1^* - \hat 0^*, $$ where $\hat 1$ and $\hat 0$ are the maps defined from ${\rm Paths}(X)$ to $X$ by $\hat 1(\gamma) = \gamma(1)$ and $\hat 0(\gamma) = \gamma(0)$. Proposition Let $X$ and $X'$ be two diffeological spaces, let $f_0$ and $f_1$ be two homotopic smooth maps from $X$ to $X'$, let $\alpha$ be a closed $p$-form on $X'$. The pullbacks $f_0^*(\alpha)$ and $f_1^*(\alpha)$ are cohomologous. Proof Let $\varphi : X \to {\rm Paths}(X')$ be the map defined by $\varphi(x) = [t \mapsto f_t(x)]$. The pullback by $\varphi$ of the identity $K(d\alpha) + d(K\alpha) = {\hat 1^*}(\alpha) - {\hat 0^*}(\alpha)$ gives $d(\varphi^*(K\alpha)) = f_1^*(\alpha) - f_0^*(\alpha)$. $\square$ This is an example of simplification/generalization of a classical theorem by short-cuting the proof through diffeology. Here also the space of paths of a diffeological space, and the Chain-Homotopy operator, are crucial. May be something more fundamental is hidden behind that. Enxin Wu a Dan Christensen student is working on a possible Quillen model based on diffeology, it will give maybe some lighting on this question?
