The legal side heavily depends on the situation. In France, it's both illegal(unless you're a top-level manager)...and common. The advice side is more complicated. If you want to be legal up to the end of your fingers, and your colleagues accept not to be, plenty of unpleasant little things may happen to you. Visibility is important for career-building, and you're not building it, or maybe negatively. There will be usually no short-term negative side-effect if you skip those unpaid events. But your political position within the firm may be damaged. And pay raises can be lower, promotions can be missed, and lay-off lists may begin by your name. So, the real answer is : it depends. If you have no plan to stay long in the firm, then by all means skip without thinking about it. If, OTOH, you have career plans there, then bite the bullet, and be a nice, concerned employee. I once made the mistake of not going(even though I was just a consultant there), and I'm blacklisted in this firm. Not all will be that tough, but you know your place better than I do. So weigh the pros & the cons. 

No Not even for a normally paid internship. For an unpaid internship, well, basically, you're just here to learn. Now that you are a productive member of the team, get a true salary, or see elsewhere where your talents will be properly paid. Not now. Yesterday. 

Raise your reputation. Visit professional events in your domain. Visit universities training the kind of people you need. Roam into discussion forums for professionals of your trade. Be aware of your market - and your image. Poach other companies, and listen to candidates, wether they accept your offer or not. And also look inside your company. Try to have people working for you speak about their working conditions. If they don't like them, be sure to improve them. If they do like them, use them as ambassadors. If they feel mistreated, or they feel the management is absurd, or whatever is wrong, they for sure won't push any of their friends to join your company. Anyways, the root cause seems to be a lack skilled people on the market. Either you need to be better than others(image, working conditions, package); or you need to train massively new people, knowing you'll lose a number of them in the process. I'm pretty sure you're gonna need both, in fact. if you are a company where it's nice to work, AND if you train more people, then you should reduce the problem to acceptable levels. 

Plenty of things may happen that explain that lateness. If you are interested, you can try to phone or mail(better phone), to get more information. The most likely explanation is that they were so busy they didn't find the time to call you back. Though there are plenty of other possibilities. As you did already call back once, don't push too much, it would be felt as harrassing. But you can ask. Most people have schedules far too full, and can't do everything they'd like to do. 

When it's done. Or, more accurately, when it's good enough. You shall not be too picky, and some details will be forgiven to an intern, but hard-coded values? debugs? Argh, those are a no-go. OTOH, if you're late, ask for help. I know it's one of the toughest things to do, but it's part of your job. If you did your "homework" before and can show people the progress you've mede, usually, they'll be likely to help you for the final part(a little bit like on stack overflow). 

Work endless hours, be paid with worthless shares instead of real money, and be thankful for your early whitening hair. And don't expect any kind of organization whatsoever, you'd better bring it with you. And as you mention France, it's not even a strong point on your CV, unless you want to work for another startup. Boring banks are far more shining for most France's recruiters. Wether it's a good thing or not, I'm not going to debate. 

Well, he obviously trusts you. Plus, as it's a small shop, IT-wise, there is not as much time for reviews than in some bigger shops. Though be warned, in some bigger shops, you're left on you own too. A team of 4 is not much, and I guess responsabilities for this small team are broad. Enjoy : you're gonna learn a lot. Computer programming is a job where you need to be autonomous to be efficient. That's time for you to learn. Be sure, though, to take the time for making extra checks to your code, both in terms of norms(does it look like something my boss would have approved?), and in terms of testing(did I test all cases? Standard? Limit? Did I test error handling? Did I make regression testing?) (EDIT : reprahsed 1st paragraph to take the comment in account). 

Usually, if there is just one occurence like that in your resume, recruiters will understand. With 2 years-long employments before, it's something that can be easily sold in interview. It's a one-shot gun, though. Accumulate several of those, and your resume will become to smell "instability". But the first one should be sellable as an accident to most recruiters. Some commenters have provided excellent ways to sell this one-time-incident-that-won't-happen-again. 

Usually, especially in big firms, HR is trying to see the candidate beyond the current post. If they feel you are a good follower, but will never be a leader, they may estimate that you have no future in their firm, and prefer a candidate that is less suited for the job to come, but who has potential to be a great leader in the years to come. I don't agree with that way of thinking, but it's the rationale. I've seen overperformers, acknowledged as such, being pushed to the exit because they were "too shy", and therefore could not, never ever, be a proper manager. So, if you're asked about being a leader, there is not much to do. If you are too shy as my unfortunate colleague, you can't fake being a leader all of a sudden. 

It shall be part of an overall strategy. You have to prove that your performance today is beyond you current pay level. The thing to negociate there(unless pay scale is carved in stone depending on your certification), is to say "my current pay level was defined against my old level of performance. my new level of performance is better, for the following reasons - blabla based on certification & a few real life examples, like your extended responsabilities". a certification alone, in itself, is nothing in my book. Some even think it's negative. But this is alone. If it's a part of a global strategy to get better, you can sell it as a part of a package that means you took a bigger dimension recently.
