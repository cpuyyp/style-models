Since the starting blocks of knowledge are distinct, separate ideas that in no way persist beyond their material existence , Hume's criticism of causality is the natural skeptical conclusion that Hume must eventually arrive at. Hume's first founding blocks of knowledge are purged of all their ability to ground the relations that persist between them. Any relations between sensations, including cause and effect, are entirely human concoctions. Arguments Against the Humean Project Piercean Argument You don't need to be a realist to take trouble with Hume's epistemological system. However, an argument might be given against Hume's epistemological program that borrows from a phenomenological argument used against nominalism by the late, great Charles Pierce. He writes: 

Hume's criticism of causality is a direct consequence of his epistemological system. You can't really understand Hume's thoughts on necessity and the causal relations between objects (or events) unless you understand how Hume thinks we experience said objects. Hume divides all knowledge into 'relations of ideas' and 'matters of fact' (this is, as you point out, 'Hume's fork'). The former Hume believes to be entirely the construct of humans, and to a probably lesser extent, so too does Hume believe the latter to be of human construct. For Hume, matters of fact are really private sense images, or 'impressions,' only secondarily experienced via memory in what he calls 'ideas.' Relations that persist between any two ideas are based entirely in Hume's threefold list of associations: resemblance, contiguity, and cause and effect. What is interesting is that Hume always talks about these associations in the context of human action. This is in keeping with his general commitment to viewing these associations as being entirely human constructions that in no way are founded in the basic impressions themselves. Given this outline, it should come as no surprise that Hume sees the notion of cause and effect as falling into the category of 'relations of ideas,' and as being, in consequence, entirely of human construction: 

We know that a long time ago life emerged from a bunch of amino acids. When I look at the world around me, I notice that it is made up mostly of inanimate matter. Yet this same inanimate matter must have come together in various permutation and combinations to provide a subjective experience - me. How is it possible? What are the various theories for the same? My own thoughts: Matter might not be entirely inanimate. The world is an illusion and everything is made on patterns involving the consciousness which was ever present. 

One could argue that "nothing", which would be the absence of all things, would be permanent in this world. 

I know that the naturals are assumed by the axiom of infinity, but the relationship between them (eg 1+0=1), must be rule based or defined at the very least. Basically I want to know what makes 0 or 1 abstract. For me to figure that out, I must also have their precise definitions? I know that 0 is an abstract concept, but I want to know what or what not in its definition makes it so. Is abstraction another name for commonality? 

Everything in thought is a comparison. So, when you say "lying to yourself". There are two possibilities. 1) There is an objective truth of the matter. You tell yourself anything but the objective truth. In that case yes, you would be lying to yourself. Within this possibility again, you might or might not be aware of the objective truth. If you are aware of the objective truth, then there is no way you can lie to yourself and not know that you are lying. If you are not aware of the objective truth, and tell yourself otherwise, then you are lying to yourself without knowing that you are lying to yourself. (Like the example of the woman you gave above). 2) There is no objective truth of the matter. In this scenario, it is really hard to deduce if you are indeed lying to yourself. In fact, it might be impossible to do so. If the only truth is subjective, then from your point of view, the best subject is you, yourself. So whatever you tell yourself will happen to be true. 

Using this general logical argument that Charles Pierce employed against nominalists, we can twist it slightly to point out the oddity in Hume's position of trying to make out any sense of 'impression' that doesn't welcome as well the sense of relation between 'impressions'. Pierce's argument, in short, amounts to this: how can we hope to logically preserve our ability to recognize impressions when we attack our ability to recognize the relations that persist between them? Change would be viewed on this model not in the presupposed, reductionist epistemological language as one distinct impression following upon another, a language that threatens the continuity of identity shared between impressions themselves which (according to Pierce) in turn threatens any identity of any sensory image, but as one subsistent object losing or gaining something. Sellarsian Argument Another recent insight that we might use to reject the radically skeptical Humean conclusions is to accept the new findings by Wilfrid Sellars (among others) regarding the 'myth oft the given.' The short of this argument is that nothing can serve as a justification in our field of knowledge besides something that is itself conceptually significant. Put in other words, knowledge isn't an entirely passive experience. The human subject participates in knowledge. This in itself tells us that action, which is in turn a subcategory of change, is a real feature. But putting that point aside, we can apply this insight to Humean epistemology and, in doing so, see the justification of the insight itself. For Hume to even talk about this impression compared to that impression is an activity that is loaded down with conceptuality, which is composed, in turn, of relations. The Sellarsian would say to the Humean something like this: you are already caught in commitments to relations, such as cause and effect, before you try to bring us back down to the epistemically barren wasteland of 'impressions.' This is self-evidenced in that it is not your impressions that are justifying any of your positions: it is your comparative, relational logic. This argument, while not flatly disproving Hume's specific epistemological opinions about causality, does get after something that is probably more important: motivation. This argument asks Hume why he's trying to pull off his whole program in the face of the fact that it is relations themselves that are epistemologically more basic than sensations (at least as far as explicit knowledge goes). In Sellarsian fashion we would say to Hume that it is not sensory impressions that should compel all talk of justification: it is, on the contrary, the conceptually significant relations that are actually affirmed or negated. Psychological Argument Another argument against the Humean criticism of causality is pretty basic. In short, it wants to get after the normativity of causality as experienced. Why is it that we connect certain successive events in a causal way while we don't connect other successive events in a causal way? Hume never seems to get after the full explanation of the causal phenomenon itself. When he poses this question to himself, he busies himself with tackling the problem of inference, but even this consideration implicitly assumes the phenomenon of past causal connections rather than effectively reducing them away. In other words, he is always caught taking advantage of causal connections rather than truly reducing them to distinct impressions. This is why Kant, in response to Hume, held to the irreducibility of the principle of causality, if not as a principle of reality, then as a principle of mind. 

Sadly there are issues with some aspects of contemporary physics. I'm an outsider, an IT guy who got involved about ten years back when I came to realise that physics was going to hell in a handcart. I'm trying to do something about it, but it's not easy. 

If you ask a typical physicist what is light, you won't get a satisfactory answer. But there are physicists out there who do know, and I know them. So, what do you want to know? 

Have a look at Is The Speed of Light Everywhere the Same? It's by Don Koks the PhysicsFAQ editor, and the answer is no. If the speed of light was the same throughout the room you're in, your pencil wouldn't fall down. Sadly a lot of physicists will tell you the speed of light is absolutely constant. Even though this flatly contradicts Einstein, see this from 1920: 

The latter. GÃ¶del's incompleteness theorems are to do with mathematical logic. Knowledge involves evidence and experiment too. As for noumena, that's an issue in its own right. Can you show me some? The synthetic apriori truths are an issue too. They're rather like "the laws of physics". They don't have any ontological reality. It's like the Terry Pratchett quote: "Take the universe and grind it down to the finest powder and seive it through the finest seive, and then show me one atom of justice, one molecule of mercy". What exists is space and waves and things. They do what they do because of the way they are, not because of truth or law. Let's take a look at the theorems. I think the Wiki articles are pretty good: "The first incompleteness theorem states that no consistent system of axioms whose theorems can be listed by an "effective procedure" (i.e., any sort of algorithm) is capable of proving all truths about the relations of the natural numbers (arithmetic)". That's just to do with the natural numbers, which are merely a concept. You cannot point up to the clear night sky and say "look, there's a seven". It doesn't have a huge amount to do with the real world of science and observation and experiment. The other one is more to do with science, but it still deals with theories and arithmetic truths, which are abstract things: "For any formal effectively generated theory T including basic arithmetical truths and also certain truths about formal provability, if T includes a statement of its own consistency then T is inconsistent." You cannot point up to the clear night sky and say "look, there's a theory" either. A theory is just a concept too. It describes how things are and it makes predictions, which we test with experiment. All GÃ¶del is really saying is that a theory can't be introspective, it can't prove itself. So whilst this stuff is relevant to maths and logic and theory, you shouldn't read to much into it. But don't think GÃ¶del is a waste of time. See A World Without Time: The Forgotten Legacy of Godel and Einstein. It's by philosopher Palle Yourgrau, and IMHO it's of crucial importance to understanding space and waves and things. To understanding the world and the reality that's out there. I can hold my hands up and show you a space, I can waggle my hands and show you motion. But can you show me time? 

I understand the value of falsifiable beliefs. Often they make predictions, and are classified as scientific ideas, useful in churning out predictions. But do unfalsifiable beliefs have any value? Philosophically or mathematically or otherwise? I know value is a little vague, but consider for example the concept of eternal return. If true it would have a large impact. But, then it's unfalsifiable. Can't be verified at all. So a sentence A, if true would have a large impact, but it's unfalsifiable at the same moment, would you assume any importance to such sentences? 

The reasoning breaks the definition. I made the blunder of assuming that doubt could be meaningfully defined in such a situation. 

Let's define logic as: A statement and it's opposite, obtained by applying the "not" operator, both cannot be true. The not operator is applied to the part of the sentence describing action or attribute. Example: a) The apple is red. The apple is not red. b) Swamy crossed over the fence. Swamy did not cross over the fence. If in a set of statements, there exist two statements which are both true, and are opposites, then the set is inconsistent. Do all paradoxes fall under the set of inconsistent statements or set of statements? (Assuming of course that I have reasonably and objectively defined "logic", and other terms). 

$URL$ Both these arguments look sound to me. You only have to argue that "nothingness", can exist. From there it's a short step to saying that it always exists. In the second case particularly, linking nothingness to the empty set, say that the empty set exists, then it is always a member of all sets that exist, due to it's simplicity. Of course, one would never be able to detect nothing, since one can only detect physical objects which exists, so actually proving the argument is impossible.
