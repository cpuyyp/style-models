The point of science is not just the generation and selection of theories, it is giving explanations of observations. Kuhn calls this work of applications 'normal science' and contends that it really is most of science, and the most important part of the whole body of science. It is, after all, upon 'normal science' that we base engineering disciplines like bridge building, automotive design and pharmacology. From a Kuhnian point of view, existing accepted theories are not independent, they are woven together into a paradigm. So when you propose replacing one with a new theory, you are challenging not just the theory being replaced, but its contributions to all of the other applications in which it has been combined with other theories to produce explanations. All of those explanations seem to work, or they would not have been accepted. Unlike the Popperian model you allude to that chooses to focus primarily upon falsification, a more realistic model (such as Kuhn's) considers the overall faith in an existing theory and its track record of success, as well. So in order to choose a different basic explanation, you need some excuse for why those existing explanations worked, or you need for the new theory to be clearly enough better to require re-deriving all of the explanations that involved the old one, despite the widespread faith in and dependence upon the existing work. This means that there is a good reason for science in general to be conservative, and to maintain older theories not just until there is adequate evidence against them, but until that evidence overwhelms the success they have had, and they are truly no longer tenable. Kuhn's historical work itself focusses on what happens at the point where old theories do finally break down, and considers the results disruptive enough that he characterizes these as 'revolutions', with all the metaphorical blood shedding that implies. 

I accept Jung's position that even without a deity or supernatural governor, everyone ultimately holds a faith. If you are trading in your old faith for a new one, it is always better not to define yourself by contrast. Dawkins philosophy of opposing religious thinking completely is ultimately an impossible task. Even structures like science and government involve things that are ultimately faith-based reasoning. (Why do we trust in the existence of universal principles? To what extent do we believe that logic matters? Upon what do we wish to found our notions of value? -- These are issues of choosing a faith.) So the answer here depends upon what part of your old faith is not working for you, and by what contradictions or weaknesses you are motivated to leave religion. Without more data, moving away from any one thing does not give you a destination. And any complete worldview requires a destination, not just an enemy. But, choosing rather randomly (between three folks upon whom I rely for a lot of context that I consider faith-based) to my mind, one of the saner explicitly atheist philosophers, who addresses his divergence from traditional beliefs in a way that is not just an escape, but a productive refinement, is Daniel Dennett. He is one of the most prominent spokesmen of the 'Brights Movement', after Dawkins, and he is also genuinely a philosopher, and not just a critic -- so he is less dismissive, attacking and rash than Dawkins. One of his basic philosophical motivations is to replace the remnants of the 'Cartesian Theater': the idea that the mind and the body are completely separate in any way. This seems like a strange foundation on which to build any sort of global understanding of the world, but it results in a thoroughgoing reorganization of a lot of basic philosophical notions that we all fail to question, and that fit together nicely to explain ourselves without being too dominating. It takes us closer to nature by emphasizing the continuity of evolution and diminishing the 'miracle' of the 'origin' of the mind. Humanistic traditions often still worship the mind as miraculous after they have decided there are no miracles, which is a counterproductive hypocrisy. Dropping it makes us think about why we adopt the moral standards that we do, and what we might all learn by being less special. The notion of the parallel nature of all biological processes challenges us to look at our minds in a more realistic way that is not tied directly to our stream of consciousness, more like the way we look at our bodies. Meditation and prayer, setting aside the stream of consciousness and our individuality is then not some kind of sacrifice, mystical goal, escape from reality or feat of casting ourselves upon the mercy of some higher being. It is a natural part of self-exploration that constitutes another, more deeply aesthetic, dimension of natural thought that we neglect when we dwell in the conscious mind. Theories of meaning that do not descend from human language but upon deeper considerations of how the parallel and serial processes of our minds can construct one another, point out how much life is story-driven and how we impose sequential processes because of our attachment to social cues. This doesn't dissolve our attachment to mythology, but leans back toward Jung, and puts it in context as a necessary part of the way humans think. 

But it is much more a part of corruption to hold and manipulate debts than to release them. Debts are more often paid off by the wealthy and held over the poor as threats. So it decreases the power of the corrupt if history is not allowed to accumulate over time. To limit the accumulation of debt, there was once a tradition in Jewish law to allow debts to only be held for so long, often 7 years, and for entire communities to release everyone's debts every 49 years and start over with a clean slate. Jesus is suggesting amplifying this, and not holding debts at all. It is true that this lets abusers off the hook. But in the end, the momentary abuse is generally nothing compared to the leverage of accumulated manipulation that is the norm in our culture. Also, you releasing your debtors is not a requirement for you to be forgiven. The word is 'as', in the same way, not 'as' in the sense of 'because'. It cannot be true that, as Jesus told the Apostles 'those you hold accountable, are held accountable' if those folks then get forgiven by forgiving others. In a Catholic interpretation you get forgiven by the Law, or by the Church (who inherits that power granted by Jesus from the Apostles), and not by your own doing at all. In a more Calvinist interpretation it is not your place to judge, it is God's, and you have to forgive others just because you have no power or incentive not to do so. Your attempt at power is chasing an illusion, and it is your arrogance in presuming his right, not your vindictiveness itself, that God will punish if you judge others. There are intermediate positions that feel like you are forgiven because you are forgiving, but they are not very stable logically. (I am not really a Christian any more. So I am judging this by criteria an insider might not apply.) Edit -- context: That last fact makes it look silly that I answered the question. So I feel I need to defend myself against those who closed the first version... I do have a context for interpreting Christianity in a way that is philosophical and not religious. I accept George Pixley's interpretation of Judaism as our oldest recorded attempt to build a large-scale fully-binding social contract not negotiated with a monarch or ruling family. (God eventually gave the Jews a king, but only several generations after the contract that limited his prerogatives was clear. That he then broke it twenty different ways does not matter, because it survived his dynasty anyway. No one else seems to have done that, in that order.) Then Christianity is a more sophisticated philosophical revival of that basic proposition that allows for greater freedom and continuing revision on the basis of presumed, and not compelled cooperation with the process. Jesus's words matter because his motives are uniquely in tune with the original enterprise. And stable Christian sub-traditions are compelling to the degree they build interpretations of his words. 

AFAICT, you are just talking about misinterpretation, and I know of no schedule or inventory of common types of misinterpretation. It might be an interesting question to ask for contributions to such a list. Do others here think that would be on-topic? Or would it be too inviting of opinion? (He asks is what is obviously the wrong place. Is there a better one? (While I am asking things in an answer, I might as well pile-on) ) I could start with some seeds: 

That depends on what you think math is. From an intuitionist point of view, math is the study of human idealizations. And there is no good reason to be surprised that we would, given millions of years of trial and error, evolve a really strong intuition that would allow us to understand a lot of the natural world. Nor that once we had language and adequate time to dwell inwards that we should not be able to unwind those intuitions into precise language forms over thousands of years. The economy of mathematics is sometimes striking, to me: that so many parts of it are really just other parts in variant forms. But I would blame that on the fact we are in a very orderly corner of the universe, compared to what might be. If you think math is somehow independent of human psychology, and not the collective set of modelling tools at its disposal, then the consistent meeting up of fact and form becomes much more mystical. But then that big mystery becomes a good reason to question that independence. From that angle the conventions you find so bizarre, are largely just that, conventions, if ones we worked out over generations, and are pretty much born into making. The idea that we can think of multiplication on the complex numbers as scaling and rotation has a lot to do with the relative paucity of our own simple models of motion, and not so much to do with independent reality. After all, we really wanted circular planetary orbits. When we want to model waves, we try hard to make sure they get expressed in terms of the components of a rotation. And when we decided to model particles, we 'found' they have rotational inertia, despite that their rotation has to be 720 degrees, and acts relatively little like actual rotation. Once you let the real awkwardness of that notion sink it, it seems to me like polar coordinates are a solution in search of a problem, not something that just happens to crawl out of so many niches. 

This is another question I have never seen considered by a philosopher, but it is important in psychoanalysis. Death may not meaningfully deprive the dead person of anything, but it clearly deprives those most closely involved with that person of whatever they are getting out of those relationships. So considering death is averse to the person being killed because that person holds obligation personally, including the ambiguous obligation that simply being in relationship entails. Existential forms of psychoanalysis that focus on identity and motivation therefore always impute loss to death, because one affect how the requirements of your identity play out or pursue your motivations after that point. To the point that your social identity is you, it is threatened by death, and, therefore, you are. Your bodily instincts know that, even if your conscious mind has decided otherwise. From that point of view, killing is an assault not so much on the dying person in his current state, but upon his past ability to plan his life (the ways in which that has been rendered flawed, incomplete or damaging when it could have been more rational) and upon those who might have been affected by those plans. This includes (if you believe in them) the transpersonal and transferential motives that might have been advanced by his existence. (For Kleinians, e.g. the loss of a parent removes a symbolic real-object link, and any attachments to the images of that parent then must be resolved by less efficient means.) Only a person free from the conflation of self and identity, outside the constraints of real obligation, and neutral toward all transpersonal goals, can, then choose death without loss. Those are relatively few. And even toward them, forcing the issue, by threatening death, or otherwise causing it to be considered as an option, is always destructive, even when the actual killing might not be. The very detachment and equanimity that would make them able to accept death is threatened by instinctive reactions over which no human truly has control. Besides that, the transpersonal and transferential goals are still not those of the person making the decision, so they cannot be ruled out by his choice. Thus, from a broad enough psychodynamic perspective, death is a comparative harm both to the individual and to others, in imaginal and symbolic terms, even though there is not necessarily anything in the real world that is being taken away from the deceased. 

This is a false dichotomy which falls apart under a little introspection. In attempts to contrast reason with emotion, we are confusing the message with its medium. We are biological entities, and we refer almost every aspect of our state of mind through our senses and emotions. Even when you are acting logically, that logic is mediated through an emotion. We have a feeling of 'rightness' or 'clarity' when we accept our own deductions, which is, in itself, a physiological sensation that accompanies or predicts the mind's ease with the decision. If we cannot reach that point in some way, we do not find the action reasonable, whatever its source. We rely upon our emotional machinery to accommodate our experience and to come to give this signal of 'rightness' in the presence of appropriately logical deductions. But we expect the same of our other emotions when we learn to fear the sound of an oncoming car but not to be afraid of the dark. Effective fear that has served us appropriately seems equally 'right'. In the end, just as we may avoid accidents by trusting our fear, other successful use of logic rests upon developing a trustworthy relationship with other emotions, often this emotional sensation of harmony. In more modern terms, rationality depends upon finding ways to resolve "cognitive dissonance". Cognitive dissonance experiments themselves seem to indicate that whatever behavior we exhibit that cannot be explained rationally to ourselves becomes part of our future reason, usually in the form of perceptual bias. If we work harder than expected and are not paid more we retroactively find the work more pleasant or more meaningful than if we were paid more (see Festinger). Boot camp and hazing create a sense of duty. Seemingly perversely, removing the threat of punishment makes people feel unsafe (see studies of early Naval discipline, of the aftermath of Stockholm syndrome, and of the domestically abused), because we internalize compliance as a value when we answer to authority in defiance of our own logic. Habit becomes logic the same way logic becomes habit. This can be used as a basis for a general theory of learning via emotional adaptation, where we are evolved to incorporate reason from outside sources to exactly the degree we do not already have it. So when apparently effective external causes escape our ability to explain them, they become part of our understanding, instead. It is tempting to point out the experience of using language to capture logic. We can try to identify reason with verbally-processed motivation. But we see at the same time how verbal processing can be used to whip someone up into a frenzy or impart dread. So this is not a useful contrast, either, just a trend. Tradition has often tried to make a distinction between the chaotic emotions and the calmer reason. But really there are only a range of emotions from the more chaotic to the most calm, and the latter are more trainable by experience. So we have no choice but to act from emotion, which has been trained by experience, and therefore incorporates reason. They are layers in a mediated system, with reason relying upon emotion for its acquisition and enforcement.
