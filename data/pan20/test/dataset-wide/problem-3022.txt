It was already an RN boat. It was "requisitioned" or "commandeered". You volunteered your craft. Who knows? It's only known that the boat was a Dunkirk. 

Abraham Lincoln's birth mother, Nancy Lincoln, died when Abraham was 9 of either milk sickness or possibly consumption. Milk sickness is from drinking milk contaminated with the poison tremetol by the cows eating snakeroot. Two other people on the Lincoln's property also died of milk sickness. I can find no suggestion of foul play. After Nancy died his father Thomas Lincoln married Sarah Bush Lincoln. She lived until 1869 outliving both Thomas and Abraham. I also cannot find mention of Abraham shooting anyone, in the eye or otherwise. It is possible he shot someone during his stint as a Captain during the Black Hawk War, but that would be 20 years before his father died. 

I imagine that these chickens were plucked in order for one to tell that they had "curly yellow fat" or were "bony". 

For example, on October 1st 1949, the People's Republic of China (PRC) was proclaimed. Would hundreds of millions of people then suddenly have switched from being citizens of the Republic of China (ROC) to the PRC? I was inspired to ask this question because Tu Youyou has been heralded as the first science Nobel Prize winner from China (presumably meaning the PRC). But Yang Chen-Ning and Lee Tsung-Dao also won the Physics Nobel Prize in 1957. According to Wikipedia, both moved to the USA in 1946, but became US citizens only in 1962 and 1964. So what was the citizenship of these two men when they won the Nobel Prize in 1957? The PRC or the ROC or something else? 

The Battle Of France says "Non!" Simply defining an objective measure of "war preparation" which can work between two countries using different equipment and tactics is quite difficult and would be its own question. Using quantitative means, like supply levels, or numbers of aircraft and tanks, ignores the qualitative differences between the equipment. It also ignores the radical change in tactics and pace of warfare which the Allies were about to be smacked in the face with. And that's the ultimate analysis of a military, how did it do on the battlefield? How did Britain and France do on the ground against the Germans in 1940? Pretty damn poorly. Looking at why the Allies did so poorly highlights the problems of determining military readiness for armies which haven't been in a major battle for a generation. Sometimes a battlefield loss can be up to tactical circumstances, but the Battle Of France is an entire campaign for the existence of a country. And it was a pretty clear German victory strategically and tactically. You have to make radical changes to the Allied concept of war to let the Allies win. On paper, the Allies should have done all right. They were fighting a defensive battle from entrenched positions meaning they could expect to win with less. They had parity in troops, twice the number of artillery pieces, and over 1000 more tanks (and arguably better). The only quantitative material advantage the Germans had was in aircraft, nearly double the number. Aircraft provide flexibility of recon and firepower, more important to an attacker than a defender. Prepared For The Last War The Allies were well prepared for World War I, slow moving, grinding trench warfare. Their equipment, tactics, logistics, and generalship were all geared around establishing and holding a solid line and keeping it supplied with men and material. So in that sense they were very prepared for war... the last one. Meanwhile, the Germans were busy changing the pace of warfare and making the Allied preparations moot. Many potential breakthroughs of WWI fizzled not because of enemy response, but because the troops breaking through didn't know what to do next; they sort of milled around waiting for orders. The Germans busied themselves reorganizing their entire chain of command to be flexible to changing circumstances expanding on the Stormtrooper tactics introduced in WWI. They installed radios and other mobile communication equipment in their vehicles. They used light machine guns at the small unit level for offense, not just defense. Their air force coordinated with the ground force to provide close tactical air support and act as flying artillery to support offensive operations. They trained their commanders to bypass strong points rather than slowly bludgeon them. In short, the German army was focused on probing the enemy for weaknesses, making a breakthrough, and then rapidly exploiting it before the enemy can respond to plug the gap. The Allies were not prepared for this war, and found themselves always outflanked. Their communications and intelligence could not deliver a clear picture of the battlefield to their commanders fast enough, so orders were based on outdated or fragmentary information. Orders could not be issued to units fast enough, so units acted on old information. When they could stand and fight the Allies did quite well as at Arras and holding the line at Dunkirk, but those were the exception. That is not to say the Germans were prepared. They took a huge gamble on new tactics and equipment, and hoped the Allies would not realize their gaping deficiencies. But they had a dress rehearsal, the Battle of Poland. Here they got to test out their new tactics and equipment, and as Military History Visualized shows in Panzers In Poland: Success, Failures & Losses, they found many problems. Fortunately for Germany, the Allies gave them half a year to rectify them and recover their losses. The Allied hesitancy to take advantage of the bulk of the German army fighting in Poland speaks volumes to their lack of being prepared to fight this war. Had the Allies been more aggressive, they'd have found a very lightly defended German border, and history might have been very different. Instead, they stayed in their defenses and waited. Had the Battle of France turned into a drawn out slugging match, German logistical and equipment inferiorities would have become a problem. This is illustrated starkly by the war on the East against the Soviets; it began as a wildly successful lightning war, but their failure to achieve decisive victory meant it turned into a slugging match the Germans could not win. Who was better prepared for that war? Hard to say. 

Other than race, one key difference between the two institutions was that serfs were obliged to do military service: 

For 1900 onwards, the US Census Bureau has population estimates for each US state, for each year. There are also decennial censal counts for 1860, 1870, 1880, etc. But where can I find population estimates for each US state, for each year from 1865-1899? It seems that there are no official US Census Bureau estimates. Using the decennial counts, I can certainly make crude interpolations, but I am hoping that someone somewhere has constructed more precise estimates (as the US Census Bureau has done for 1900 onwards). 

Pole arms vary greatly in length and purpose. Everything from a Zulu iklwa, a short 1 to 2 meter personal thrusting weapon... 

This is untrue of (or at least unnecessary for) both communism and centrally planned economies. A centrally planned economy is one where production, prices, and distribution are set by the government, not by market forces. No monopoly is necessary. Communism does not require a centrally planned economy, but rather is about the ownership of the means of production which covers a wide spectrum of social, political, and economic structures. What you're asking about is the Soviet model. It's important to not use the Soviet model as a stand in for communism. Communism is a very broad set of social, political, and economic philosophies. The Soviet model is a specific, and rather broken, flavor featuring a centrally planned economy, single party control, and powerful committees. The Soviet model is more like an oligarchy masquerading as communism. Two examples of centrally planned economies within the United States are large scale manufacturing for the military and, until very recently, space. The US government is the major buyer of things like aircraft carriers, tanks, nuclear submarines, and heavy launch vehicles. They effectively control what is produced, who it gets distributed to and, somewhat, the price. The US government deliberately doles out contracts to multiple suppliers, even to the point of paying more money, in order to keep multiple suppliers around (also to get the votes of powerful senators by funneling money to their districts). This is to foster competition, prevent a single company from controlling the market, and also as a hedge in case one goes out of business. For example, there were two builders of US Navy submarines, Newport News Shipbuilding and General Dyanamics Electric Boat, but reductions in the US navy's submarine fleet means now there is only one, Electric Boat. Should something happen to General Dynamics this would be put the US's ability to build submarines, a highly specialized skill, in danger. 

What were the effective dates of each of these two laws? I am asking for purposes of my academic research, which relates to the history of the American family. 

I know little about North Korean history, but their official narrative and what I had also believed is that - long story short - Kim Jong-Il basically just inherited his dictatorial powers from his father, as per his father's wishes. There does not seem to be anything on the Wikipedia page of either Kim Jong-Il or Kim Il-Sung that contradicts this "long story short" version of North Korean history. Yet, I was surprised to read in Jang Jin-Sung's Dear Leader (2014) that there was in fact a vicious power struggle. So my questions are: (1) Is Jang correct? (2) If he is correct, was this already common knowledge amongst students of North Korean history, and just unfamiliar to the broader public? Or are these new and surprising revelations? Some excerpts: 

Source This gave the British not only a 2:1 quantitative advantage, but also a qualitative one. This is the only time the M3 Grant shined. Rushed into service as a stopgap, it's generally considered a very flawed tank. It has a very high silhouette. It's riveted armor means those rivets will fly everywhere inside the tank when it takes a hit. It's then enormous 75mm gun was powerful, but the bulk of the tank had to be exposed to use it. The 37mm "anti-tank" gun was underpowered. But in North Africa in 1942 its heavy armor and heavy firepower outclassed most of what the Italians and Germans had to offer. The M4 Sherman did even better. With that same 75mm gun now in the turret and thicker cast and wielded armor on the same reliable M3 drive train, it had all the strengths of the M3 without the flaws. It was superior to even Germany's Panzer III and IV at the time. (The Panzer III did anti-tank work with a 50mm gun, the Panzer IV was for infantry with a howitzer. These roles would later be reversed.) 

In Switzerland, it had to pass a popular referendum. (Switzerland also joined the UN and legalized abortion only in 2002 — both decisions that were passed through referendum.) Similarly in Liechtenstein, 1984, where the 4th referendum in 16 years only narrowly passed despite support from newspapers and both major political parties. Passing a popular referendum is a much higher bar than say passing a law (e.g. UK, 1918) or a constitutional amendment (e.g. US, 1920). (Edit: I don't mean in general. I mean just for the issue of women's suffrage. Just my opinion.) And in France for example, the Committee for National Liberation simply gave women the right to vote in 1944. Were it by referendum, it would probably have taken years more before French women had the right to vote (though perhaps not as late as 1971). 

No. Like many inventions before and during WWII, it was too early. Too expensive and too impractical with the immature technology. And once the country went on war footing, they needed the money to blow things up. Things would advance quickly and ten years after the network was shut down we'd have ubiquitous TV sets. Ironically, AT&T was predicting ubiquitous video phones in 1993 and they were still decades early. 

By 1944, US submarines were very experienced and had ironed out their problems with their equipment. They had been conducting an extremely successful offensive campaign against Japanese shipping since the beginning of 1942, and unlike German U-boats, had not taken heavy losses and so gained in experience. They had fixed the flaws in the Mark 14 torpedo finally giving them a reliable weapon. In contrast, by 1944 the operations of Japanese submarines were severely limited by both fuel and Allied air superiority. The Allied experience in fighting the Battle Of The Atlantic; convoys, radar, sonar, air support, plus a huge production of US destroyers to protect convoys; was put to use in the Pacific. This meant little easy pickings for the Japanese submarines. Japanese submarines were often pressed into service to resupply Japanese garrisons behind enemy lines. All this meant they did not have the operational experience that the US had. Strategically, the US knew the Japanese were coming and from what general direction. The night before the battle they'd intercepted a radio transmission. Radio direction finding gave the position, and the content let them know it was the Japanese carriers. The US could position their line of submarines so the Japanese fleet ran right over them. In contrast, the Japanese were surprised by the US attack on the Marianas. They were looking to engage the main US fleet and so attacked. In doing so they could not put out a picket line of submarines for the US fleet to run over. Tactically, that US submarines were attacking during a pitched air battle gave them a great advantage. With ships maneuvering at high speed and watching for aircraft they'd be less likely to be spotted in the chaos. 

I don't know much about ancient Egypt but presumably we now know more than Adam Smith. So I was wondering to what degree is the above quote true? This page for example says its wasn't a "rigid inheritance".

Chinese Wikipedia writes that different authors gave different orderings. (Examples: scholar-merchant-farmer-artisan in 春秋穀梁傳·成公元年 and farmer-scholar-artisan-merchant in 荀子·王制篇.) It then claims without citation that
