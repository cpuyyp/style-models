In cycling races all riders wear race numbers for easier identification. Are there som rules or traditions which decide which team gets which set of numbers? By looking on some races, it looks that number 1 is assigned to the past winner, if they start again this year. But I am not sure how it works with higher numbers. I am also not sure what happens if the last year's winners does not start. Also, does it depend on the cyclist who won last year or on the team who won the previous edition of the race? If there are rules about this, are they different for stage races and one-day race? 

The Wikipedia article on 2017 WTA Finals1 has some brief explanation of how qualification for this tournament works. Based on the description given there it seems that simply the top players in the race rankings are taken. (The only thing which is slightly more complicated is which tournaments have to be counted, it seems that they are Grand Slams and some Premier level tournaments, with some possible exceptions.2 Apart from rankings, are there some other conditions player has to fulfill to qualify? 

I wonder how the rules and format of the year-end championship in the ATP tour and WTA tour evolved. For example I notice that in 1985 men played knock-out tournament, whereas in 1986 the semifinalist were decided in round-robin. I see a similar change between 2002 and 2003 women tournament. The first men's masters tournament in 1970 involved only 6 players playing round-robin. In 1984-1998 women played best-of-five, while in other editions they played best-of-three. What were the changes of the format of this competition in the past? (How did the number of contestant change? Which tournaments included round robin? In which editions only round-robin/only knock-out tournament?) 

I've read that at Giro there is a Fair play prize. It is one of the minor classifications. It is mentioned, for example, in the Wikipedia article on this year's Giro. However, not much details are given there and information about minor classification is marked as "citation needed". (Here is link to the current revision if that article. It says that: Teams also take part in the Fair Play classification where teams are given penalty points for minor technical infringements.) I would like to find out more about this award. Based on which criteria are points in this classification given? Are there similar awards in other Grand Tours (or other stage races)? 

I have noticed that Benoit Paire plays this week challenger tournament in Sophia Antipolis and he is listed among players who received wildcard. Paire is currently No. 40 in ATP rankings. Does a player from top 50 need a wildcard in order to play in a challenger tournament? Are there some other restrictions which could prevent players which are high in ATP rankings from playing ATP Challenger Tour? 

All (or at least almost all) tournaments at ATP level have a qualifying competition, from which players can get into the main draw. Do players get some points if they win a match in the qualifying rounds? If not, do at least winners of the qualifying get points? (IIRC the players who enter main draw get points even if they are defeated in the first round already.) 

Here ROW stands for regulation time wins plus overtime wins. So even if Capitals tie Red Wings in the number of points at the end of this season, they will have less ROW. 

represents how much is the winning larger than our stake. We can also calculate from the above equations b1,b2,b3; i.e., the percentage of our stake to put on various outcomes. We can have a look on a particular example. Suppose we find the following odds at various bookmakers 

We try to optimize the wagers in a such way that the winning in all cases is maximal possible. This yields the winning

For questions like this, one possible approach is to make a community-wiki answer, where several users can contribute if they find some relevant records. Grand Slams - Men 

It happens quite often that a tennis tournament is not finished on Sunday. Due to weather or other reason. A few examples (I wanted to include various leves - Grand Slam, ATP Tour, ATP Challenger Tour; I have no doubt that many other examples can be found): 

What are the main differences betwwen Challengers and Futures tournaments. Do conditions under which players may enter them differ? Are there differences in the way points are calculated in the rankings? 

I will add quote from UCI cycling regulation - Part II: Road Races (version on 05.02.2015), which seems to confirm what was written in the other answers: 

Since 1/6+1/5+1/1.746=0.9394<1 this is an arbitrage, and the profit is 1/0.9394=1.0645; which means the potential profit is 6.45%. Arbitrage of type pk/X/2 Let us have a look at one more type of arbitrage. Many bookmakers offer bet called pk (standing for pick-em) or handicap 0 which works as follows: If the team wins, the bettors obtains the winning; in the case of draw the bettor gets his stake back. If the team loses the match, the bettor loses his stake. Let us have a look again what happens if the bettor bets on all three possible outcomes. (They are, so to say, partially complementary.) 

Michael Chang, 15 years 7 months, 1987 Las Vegas Richard Gasquet, 16 years, 2002 Montauban Bernard Tomic, 16 years 4 months, 2009 Melbourne Kent Carlsson, 16 years 7 months, 1984 Neu-Ulm Marcos Ondruska, 16 years 7 months, 1989 Durban Rafael Nadal, 16 years 9 months, 2003 Barletta Félix Auger-Aliassime, 16 years 10 months, 2017 Lyon Novak Djokovic, 17 years, 2004 Budapest Paul Dogger, 17 years, 1988 Porto Juan Martín del Potro, 17 years 1 months, 2005 Montevideo 

We would like to maximize the winning in the case of any outcome, hence W=o1b1=o2b2=o3b3 which yields b1=W/o1 b2=W/o2 b3=W/o3 If we bet the amount of B altogether, then . To obtain an arbitrage, we need W>B, i.e., 

Both Wikipedia article and 2014 ATP Rulebook mention additional qualifying points. (For example, 25 points in Grand Slams.) The exact quote from rulebook is this: 

It is worth mentioning that only the last 6 penalties in this series were in Premier League, previously he played in lower competitions. This only adds up to 33 penalties. I am not sure where the discrepancy from the sources saying that he scored 34 penalties comes from. 

Here is an answer listing times of first goals in FIFA World Cups. It is community wiki, feel free to edit it - correct mistakes, add more sources, etc. 2014: Marcelo (own goal) 11' 2010: Siphiwe Tshabalala 55' 2006: Philipp Lahm 6' 2002: Diop 30', 1998: César Sampaio 5' (or 4' according to some sources) 1994: Klinsmann 61' 1990: Omam-Biyik 67' 1986: Altobelli 43' 1982: Vandenbergh 62' 1978: Rossi 29'1 1974: Breitner 18'1 1970: Dermendzhiev 13' 1 1966: Pelé 15', Held 15' 1 1962: Facundo 4'3 1958: Simonsson 17' 1954: Milutinovic 15'3 1950: Ademir 30' 1938: Gauchel 29' 1934: Belis 4'3 1930: Laurent 19'3 1The first match of the tournament was a goalless draw, this goal is not from the opening match. 2The first two matches of the tournament were goalless draws. 3 Several matches started at the same time (so there was really no opening match of the tournament). 

Do players, who represent their countries in Davis Cup/Fed Cup, receive also some points in ATP rankings/WTA rankings? If yes, is it for matches on any level? Or only matches in World Group? Are the points from team competitions counted in both rankings - race ranking and ATP/WTA ranking? 

However, you can find several sources mentioning Gump Worsley - basically you can simply search for the names of these two goaltenders. Several of them cite this tweet (Wayback Machine) from ESPNStatsInfo: 

If this source is correct, then the only players who won both U-20 World Cup and senior World Cup (as of 2013) were:
