Yes. Every proper, birational morphism between smooth algebraic surfaces can be obtained by the iterated blowup at reduced points. I don't have a reference at hand, but it's contained somewhere in Beauville's book. It's probably also in Hartshorne Chapter V. The basic idea is that given such a morphism $Y \rightarrow X$, there are finitely many points of $X$ where it is not an isomorphism. You can blow up at these and $Y$ will factor through the blow-up. You repeat this process finitely many times and you'll get an isomorphism. 

Can any of you guys help me to find out if there is a retrodigitized copy of M. Ram Murty's 1976 thesis available on the online database of Carleton University Library? I really hope this question is appropriate for MO. Thanks in advance for your replies. Sources 

Later on, I would come to the conclusion that they'd decided to disregard the first condition in the definition à la Herstein because in their examples, etc., they were to analize "euclidianness" with respect to the norm in the extension which determines an application that is even completely multiplicative. 

Even with the additional assumption in your edit, the answer is still no. Take $X=Y=\mathbb A^1$ and let $f\colon X \rightarrow \mathbb P^2$ be given by sending $x$ to $(1:x:x^2)$. Let $(a:b:c)$ denote the coordinates on $\mathbb P^2$ and take $H$ to be the hyperplane defined by $b=0$. Then $Z = f^{-1}(H)$ is the single point $x=0$ and $f(Z)$ is the single closed point $(1:0:0)$. On the other hand, $\overline {f(Y)}$ is the variety defined by $b^2=ac$, so $H \cap \overline{f(Y)}$ consists of two points $(1:0:0)$ and $(0:0:1)$. 

It is well-known that not only does the arithmetic progression $\{ak+b\}_{k \in \mathbb{Z}^{+}}$ contain infinitely many prime numbers, but also that the series of the reciprocals of those primes diverges. The answer to the OP's question can be obtained now from the following general result: If $\{a_{i}\}_{i \in \mathbb{N}}$ is a strictly increasing sequence of natural numbers such that the series $\sum_{i=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{a_{i}}$ diverges, then the unending decimal fraction $\alpha$ formed by juxtaposing the successive terms of the sequence $\{a_{i}\}_{i \in \mathbb{N}}$ represents an irrational number. For a proof of this theorem, see D. J. Newman, R. Breusch, and F. Herzog. Solution to problem 4494. Amer. Math. Monthly 9 (60), Nov. 1953, pp. 632-633. or N. Hegyvári. On some irrational decimal fractions. Amer. Math. Monthly 8 (100), Oct. 1993, pp. 779-780. 

2) The Riemannian approach to the meromorphic continuation of the zeta function is based on looking at the Mellin transformation of Jacobi's $\theta$-function. It is well known, by the work of Hecke, that this approach generalizes to arbitrary Hecke L-functions. On the other hand, with this approach the information about the special values at non-positive integers of the corresponding Hecke L-function are more difficult to reveal (at least as far as I know). (EDIT: I'm aware of the fact, that calculating special values is extremely hard and one of the big challenges in number theory, I just try to understand certain structures underlying this more than beautiful area of mathematics...) This makes we wondering whether there is a relation between the approaches of Euler and Riemann to the meromorphic continuation of the zeta function. 

One algebraic version of this statement is that if $A$ is a local ring with embedding dimension $m$ and $A$ is the quotient of a regular local ring, then $A$ is the quotient of a regular local ring of dimension $m$. Write $A = R/I$ where $R$ is a regular local ring and suppose that $R$ has dimension $n$. Then we have a surjection of the Zariski cotangent spaces of the two rings $m_R/m_R^2 \rightarrow m_A/m_A^2$. We can find a basis for the kernel of this map consisting of $n-m$ vectors. Lift these to elements $f_1, \ldots, f_{n-m}$ in the kernel of $A \rightarrow R$ and let $S = R / \langle f_1, \ldots, f_{n-m}\rangle$ so that $A = S/J$ for some ideal $J$. Then I just have to show that $S$ is a regular local ring of dimension $e$. By construction, its Zariski cotangent space has dimension exactly $m$, and by the Krull principal ideal theorem, it has dimension at least $m$, so it must be a regular local ring of dimension $m$. In the setting that you asked, every local ring of a scheme of finite type over a field is the quotient of a regular local ring since it is the quotient of a localization of affine space. If you apply the argument above then you get equations $f_1, \ldots, f_{n-m}$ which define a regular scheme at $p$ and thus in a neighborhood of $p$. This is your scheme $M$. As for your question about whether $M$ can always be chosen to be $\mathbb A^m$, the answer is certainly not. Just take $p$ to be a smooth point on any non-rational variety. Then pretty much by definition, there is no neighborhood of $p$ which is isomorphic to an open subset of affine space. It would take some more work to think of an example where $p$ is singular, but it seems like a sufficiently singular point of a variety in a non-rational variety would work. (Although, I believe any zero-dimensional scheme of embedding dimension $m$ and finite type over a field has a closed immersion into affine space of dimension $m$.) 

I consider that the following lines of Hardy might help the OP to form a definite idea as to the accuracy of such an asseveration: "... I must deal with a misconception. It is sometimes suggested that pure mathematicians glory in the uselessness of their work*, and make it a boast that it has no practical applications. The imputation is usually based on an incautious saying attributed to Gauss, to the effect that, if mathematics is the queen of the sciences, then the theory of numbers is, because of its supreme uselessness, the queen of mathematics—I have never been able to find an exact quotation. I am sure that Gauss’s saying (if indeed it be his) has been rather crudely misinterpreted. If the theory of numbers could be employed for any practical and obviously honourable purpose, if it could be turned directly to the furtherance of human happiness or the relief of human suffering, as physiology and even chemistry can, then surely neither Gauss nor any other mathematician would have been so foolish as to decry or regret such applications. But science works for evil as well as for good (and particularly, of course, in time of war); and both Gauss and less mathematicians may be justified in rejoicing that there is one science at any rate, and that their own, whose very remoteness from ordinary human activities should keep it gentle and clean. *I have been accused of taking this view myself. I once said that ‘a science is said to be useful if its development tends to accentuate the existing inequalities in the distribution of wealth, or more directly promotes the destruction of human life’, and this sentence, written in 1915, has been quoted (for or against me) several times. It was of course a conscious rhetorical flourish, though one perhaps excusable at the time when it was written. " P.S. a) The emphasis is mine. b) The excerpt comes from the last paragraph of section 21 of Hardy's Apology. 

I believe that the answer to the first question is no for the reason that a local complete intersection is pretty far from a complete intersection. Take $Z$ to be $3$ points in $\mathbb P^3$ which aren't on a line. Then the Hilbert scheme of local complete intersections is a dense open subset of the Hilbert scheme of $3$ points in $\mathbb P^3$. However, the complete intersections will have to be the intersection of a cubic hypersurface with two hyperplanes, for degree reasons. Thus, the complete intersections will all lie on a single line in $\mathbb P^3$, which is not true for 3 generic points. If you assumed that $Z$ is a complete intersection, not just a local complete intersection, then what you want is probably true. 

Let $K$ be a number field. I am wondering if the following exact sequence $$1 \longrightarrow[\widehat{\mathcal O}_K^\times] \longrightarrow Gal(K^{ab}/K) \overset{\pi}{\longrightarrow} Cl_K \longrightarrow 1$$ splits, i.e. if there is a homomorphism $s:Cl_K \to Gal(K^{ab}/K)$ such that $s \circ \pi = id$. Here $[\widehat{\mathcal O}_K^\times]$ stands for the image of $\widehat{\mathcal O}_K^\times$ in $Gal(K^{ab}/K)$ under Artin's reciprocity morphism and $Cl_K$ denotes the ideal class group of $K$. Equivalently we can rewrite the above sequence idelically as $$1 \to \widehat{\mathcal O}_K^\times / \overline{\mathcal O _{K,+} ^\times} \to \widehat{\mathcal O}_K^\natural / \overline{\mathcal O _{K,+}^\natural} \to \widehat{\mathcal O}_K^\natural / (\widehat{\mathcal O}_K^\times \cdot \mathcal O _{K,+}^\natural) \to 1,$$ where $\mathcal O _K ^\natural = \mathcal O _K - \{ 0 \} $, $\widehat{\mathcal O}_K^\natural = \mathbb A _{K,f}^\times \cap \widehat{\mathcal O}_K$. Further, subscript $+$ denotes totally positive elements and over lined objects are meant to be closures in the idele topology. (I don't know if this is helpful.) 

The automorphism group of the symmetric group $S_n$ is (isomorphic to) $S_n$ when $n$ is different from $2$ or $6$. In fact, if $G$ is a complete group you can ascertain that $G \simeq \mathrm{Aut}(G)$. The reverse implication needn't hold, though. 

Let us suppose that $x^{n}+y^{n}= z^{n}$ with $x, y,$ and $z$ relatively prime. By the abc-conjecture, $|x^{n}|\ll |xyz|^{1+\epsilon}$, $|y^{n}|\ll |xyz|^{1+\epsilon}$ and $|z^{n}|\ll |xyz|^{1+\epsilon}$. Therefore, $|xyz|^{n}\ll |xyz|^{3+\epsilon}$ which implies that, for $|xyz|>1$, $n$ is bounded. Unfortunately, this establishes only an asymptotic version of FLT. Nevertheless, if we had explicit information regarding the implied constant in the abc-conjecture, we could in principle determine explicit upper bounds for those $n$'s for which the abc-conjecture doesn't settle FLT. 

This is a vague question from an interested outsider: It is well known that abelian varieties which arise as Jacobian of a curve (or a bit more general as Prym variety) are distinguished by the fact that their associated theta function satisfy the KP equation (Shiota, Mulase, Krichever and others. See also a recent strengthening of this due to Krichever). In other words those special abelian varieties appear in the Sato Grassmannian as finite dimensional orbits of the KP-flow, i.e. they admit a spectral realization in terms of the KP-flow. Now, I'm somewhat naively wondering if it's possible to realize general (pp) abelian varieties in a similar manner. Obviously, the KP-flow is not the right thing to consider, but due to recent work of Krichever and Shiota one might wonder if the Toda flow, for example, is the right thing to consider? In order to enlarge the audience for this question, one can (very naively) reformulate my above question in the following more geometric (but very imprecise, and possibly wrong) way: 1) Is it possible to express an arbitrary (pp) abelian variety in a natural way using the - tower - of moduli spaces of curves $M_g$? (In my mind I imagine rather the tower of Torelli loci $T_g$, where $T_g$ sits inside $A_g$, the moduli space of (pp) abelian varieties). Of course, one can consider moduli spaces with extra structures if needed... 2) Is it possible to express $A_g$, for a fixed $g$, in a natural way using the tower of $M_g$'s resp. $T_g$'s? (In case that makes any sense). For $g \leq 5$ this is possible, in a sense, using only the KP flow and classification results of ppav's in small dimension (they are Prym's in that case). Comment: The Torelli embedding $M_g \to A_g$ is well known. Roughly speaking, I'm asking for a map in the other direction, but with the whole tower of $M_g$'s as a target (this corresponds roughly speaking to the Toda-flow). I'm aware of the (technical) imprecisions of my question, but I hope that it's more or less clear what I want. In any case, thank you very much in advance!
