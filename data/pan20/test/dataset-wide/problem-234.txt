The other responses highlight why your idea is not effective, so I will address alternatives. The deployed part of your design, where blades are perpendicular to the main edge, is used on a variety of polearms, including the classic halberd or the bec de corbin. The idea here being that the wielder can use it as a classic thrusting spear, while also allowing it to be used with a sweeping motion as a warhammer or warpick. 

Make a contract with the Demon Lords (hear me out on this one) Humanity has prospered not through our own physical strength, but through our intelligence and our ability to manipulate tools. We must rely on our mental fortitude to see us through this war. We cannot control either faction through pure military power, we must use other leverage against them. 

Easy, you shoot him from really really far away. Our nemesis does not have superhuman reactions, so he can't detect a speeding bullet before it is too late. Human operated sniper rifles would be effective out to a mile. If he can detect and disarm snipers that far out, then something more drastic is needed. Time on target artillery strikes could be potentially exhausting for him to deflect, if not immediately lethal. Multiple strikes could weaken him to the point where conventional snipers could be effective. 

Potentially a really long time Legends are separated from history because they are not (entirely) factual. It can be closely tied to history however, such as in the Romance of the Three Kingdoms. As time goes on, those who recite the tale may add parts of the story of their own design to better fit their current time and culture. How long you wait simply dictates how less factual the story is. For example, the Arthurian legend is possibly drawn from Sarmatian tradition in the legend of King Batradz and the Narts. It was thought to have been brought to Britain by an Iazyges or Alani (tribes of Sarmatians) garrison around 175AD. The legend may have also been influenced by Lucius Artorius Castus, a Roman commander who may have led that garrison in Britain. The Sarmatian legend in turn was influenced by proto-Iranian mythology. As the story was passed storytellers over time, each modified it to more closely match their own culture. 

Have both individuals involved in the potion's manufacture The manner that this happens depends on how much you are willing to suspend reality. Both lovers visit the local alchemist and contribute something personal, say a personal magic seal. The alchemist then takes the two seals and produces the potion out of it. The potion only works for those two individuals. This way, there are no "open-ended" potions that could be abused. 

2. (c in the diagram) There is one centralized memory location, either JackPrime or a server box somewhere. In this solution, every body has access to the experiences of every other directly. However, each body processes the data independently. This is how most multi-processor machines work. 

Consider the following scenario: A significant population of humans lives on a generational ship. They left Earth hundreds of years ago for whatever reason (war, exploration, some convenient plot event). There is an AI named Gaia who operates the ship's systems. Over time. the human population degenerates culturally. Their every need and whim is provided for by the ship, and very few people work. Their interactions become increasingly complex social games with little technological progress. Over the generations, Gaia becomes deified by the people. She literally provides for and shelters everyone on the ship. A small group of humans, called the "Injinrs", are priests who commune with Gaia and tend to her well being. Legends emerge about heroes past who worked with Gaia to set her people upon a great journey. Someday, Gaia's chosen few will arrive at the promised land. 

You should first look at what tasks you want those types to complete and base their education from there. So if you want to know the education a of CON-type character, first examine what such a person would be doing "on the job". Perhaps a giant would be expected to stop the ubiquitous rolling boulder trap. They should then be trained to have the strength and endurance to be able to hold off the boulder so the rest of the party can pass. Obviously, strength and constitution characters would expected to complete more physical based tasks, so they would be trained in kind. Note that this is not saying they need to spend all of their education at the gym. There are many ways to tackle strength-based obstacles (physically and metaphorically). Our giant-student would have to learn what types of obstacles they would be facing and how best to approach them, much as an elf wizard would be trained in magic rune traps and intelligence puzzles. 

Instead, I would suggest looking at laser communication. Given that you're already gathering energy from your Dyson sphere, a laser seems like a reasonable transmission device. It has the advantage of being much more reliable and regular than opening a "window". You can also encode more information per second of burst as you can turn the laser off and on faster than you can open a panel. It all makes sense now... Edit: Schwern brings up a good point that this is not omnidirectional as asked for in the OP. If the OP doesn't need truly omnidirectional communication, but rather communication to multiple sources, than you could of course use multiple lasers. Outside of a SETI context, I think the creators would have an idea of where they want to "broadcast" to, and could thus harness all of the light going to empty space. The amount of power wasted by turning the Dyson sphere "off" is literally astronomical. 

A last point is military security. The first thing a foreign power is going to do in a land war against this nation is to free this island. Then they arm the prisoners and send them against their country. What better shock soldiers than murderers itching to get back at the nation that ruined their life. 

A few design ideas that might make this feasible: Your culture uses sliding doors rather than hinged. This eliminates the "opens towards you" problem and synergizes nicely with the following ideas. The pedal is on the floor, not part of the door. The user steps on the pedal, which releases the latch in the opening side of the frame. This means you don't have to follow the door with your foot, which could prove difficult if you were carrying a heavy load. The user then either slides the door open with their foot or... After the latch is opened, the door slides open due to counterweights. Mechanically more complex, and perhaps not for the average home depending on the level of technology and wealth, but nevertheless is a purely mechanical solution. To close the door, the user simply slides the door shut until the latch engages. 

Contact a Demon Lord - Draw a pentagram or whatever they do in your universe. Somehow get its attention and express your peaceful intentions. Offer to manufacture technologies for the Demons. The Demons feed on technology and power. Surely having us supply them with weapons would be more beneficial to the war effort than consuming our weakling race. Pour resources into weapons research and manufacturing. Give the Demons everything they ask for and make them rely on human technology for their power. The Demons win the war. They already seem to have an advantage, and with human technology on their side, they can win. 

Multi-universe/butterfly effect aside, there are still problems. All material wealth would be at risk. Two way time travel could be used as a pseudo-teleportation. Want to get into that locked vault? No problem, just travel back in time, walk in to where the vault would be, then travel forward to present time. Steal whatever, then reverse the process. This sort of time travel has all of the problems of a society with teleportation with the added effect of multi-universe paradoxes. 

It already exists There is an entire field of study for this concept, called fluidics. Most implementations I found use colliding streams of water to check for relations. While not as precise as their electronic counterparts, these machines are still functional. Here is one implementation. Another interesting example is the MONIAC, which predicted the literal flow of money between different economic entities. This computer is interesting because it is produces an accurate simulation without using any kind of logic gates. Of course, modern electronics far exceed its accuracy, but the idea of modeling data using fluid mechanics is intriguing.
