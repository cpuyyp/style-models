A basic ecological fact: for the next several hundred million years, the oceans will be uninhabitable to almost all animals. That includes jellyfish, and whatever pisciculture you had in mind. With no oxygen in the atmosphere, there is no oxygen dissolved in the oceans, either. Until the algae and other plant life have conquered the ocean (and this requires an enormous variety of both plants and bacteria), oxygen levels will remain extremely low. Once the oceans are busy cranking out oxygen, only then can the rocks begin to oxidize, and with a world full of rock waiting to be assimilated, this is going to take some time. This actually happened with the Earth - see The Great Oxygenation Event Only once the Banded Iron formations (or this world's equivalent) have been laid down will the atmospheric oxygen levels start supporting higher life. There are a few animals which are close to anaerobic, and can live at very low dissolved oxygen levels, but not many. If you want to finesse this time requirement, feel free. Yours is a magic kingdom, after all. So, let's say you've got these stations, "Stations ... primary functions are to grow algae, jellyfish and other stuff, then inject those in the oceans". You should realize that, if the oceans are colonizable, once you seed them with even a small amount of (let's say) algae, adding more simply won't help. It's the wheat/checkerboard problem - if the algae are at all successful, they will expand exponentially, and after a few years adding more from the stations will be just a drop in the bucket. What the stations might do is to provide more and more species (imported from Earth, obviously), with the goal being to increase biodiversity. Ocean currents will disperse the algae in (relatively speaking) a very short time. Once oxygen levels are up, it will only take a few loads of animals to begin explosive growth rates on that front, too, although the initial effects will probably be wild population swings until the ecosystems reach some sort of (possibly dynamic) equilibrium. As shown, your canals are not canals in the usual sense. The Venetian canals, for instance, are part of a lagoon, not a river. The difference is that canals are part of an essentially stagnant body of water, while your "canals" will have appreciable flow rates. This means that you can't grow algae and such, since they will be swept out to sea. Rooted water plants may be a possibility, but be aware that these usually require soil to root in (not wet rocks) and this will require considerable preparatory work to produce. EDIT - I suspect you're grossly underestimating the amount of plants and algae you need to support your city. Here, for instance is a paper talking about an improved algal system, and note that it suggests that such a system would provide the oxygen for one person with a power input of 30 kW. That's continuous. Figure that sunlight is about 1 kW/$m^2$ for 6 hours per day, and you need about 40 square meters of pond/lagoon per person. Note that going to vertical gardens won't help - the limiting factor is solar energy. For 2 million people, you'll need about 80 million square meters of horizontal surface, or 80 square kilometers. 

but she's surely familiar with the idea. Ask her how pulling a trigger is different from throwing a lightning bolt. The answer, of course, is that she's used to doing everyday things, and doesn't think about them, but the things she can't do are magic. It's like with artificial intelligence: "If we know how to make a computer do it, it's not AI." As Paul Simon put it, "These are the days of miracle and wonder". Magic, in general, has effects without physical causes. Depending on what stories you read, it is either accomplished by calling on supernatural beings or simply by the exercise of will, just as we move our fingers simply by wanting to. Wishing makes it so. Trying to tell a seven-year-old that this just doesn't seem to work outside of stories is a pretty hard sell - children fundamentally believe in magic. As for your literal question, the answer is that no set of changes in physics will allow magic to work. Conservation laws simply don't count, since you can simply assert that any unaccounted-for energy required is provided by magical transmutation, including fusion. (Because it's magical, there are no radiation side effects.) The big problem with making magic scientifically usable is that it destroys science. That is, no experiment can be trusted: its outcome may be altered by magical means. With no experiments which can be trusted, the cornerstone of scientific endeavor, Poppert's falsifiability, becomes impossible. 

As a general rule for a satellite tidally locked to the planet, in the short run the orbital period can by anything you want. The Earth's Moon is an example. In the long run, the orbital period of the small planet must equal the length of the larger planet's day, since tidal-locking mechanisms work both ways, although for an Earth/Jupiter type system the long run may be very long indeed. In the case of the Earth/Moon system the difference is driving the Moon outwards at a slow rate. In our case, the Sun is expected to go red giant before the Earth's day gets locked to the Moon, so you don't really need to worry about this for your larger system. At any rate, if the small planet (technically, a satellite) shows no rotation with respect to the sun, this establishes its orbital period as being the same as the primary. It would probably make sense to use the L1 point (as Hohmannfan pointed out) simply because this would keep the dark side from being too dark and cold. Planets with a face fixed toward its sun will either have ferocious winds carrying hot air (at high altitude) to the dark face and low altitude cold winds carrying the air back to the day side, or the atmosphere will freeze out on the dark side, leaving the rest of the planet airless. You might eventually want to incorporate some magic to keep the satellite from wandering away from the L1 point, since it's not dynamically stable. If the primary has not yet been locked to the satellite, timekeeping will be easy as long as the primary has fixed observable features. The appearance of the primary will change as it rotates, and this will provide a basis for primitive timekeeping. If the primary is locked with respect to the satellite, the appearance of the primary will not change with time, and timekeeping will not be obvious. However, in this case the primary will actually rotate once per year, and will have a day equal to one year. If the primary actually has no rotation, it will appear to the satellite to rotate once per year, and this rotation is probably too slow to be useful for telling time on a short (hours or less) scale. If the primary is a gas giant (which seems probable) it won't have any fixed features, so timekeeping won't be simple even if the primary appears to rotate. You might conceivably claim the primary as a very large rocky body with a thin or no atmosphere, but this also seems like you'd need magic. Natural formation of the satellite would cause the primary to hog the gasses, leaving none for the satellite. 

OK, by handwave he becomes king of France. Now what? He doesn't speak the language, he has no ties of blood to provide a base for alliances, he's an atheist in a time when public piety was essential, and he can't even fight for himself. He has no time to spare for widespread social reform - survival will take up all his energy. And in some respects all he has to do is wait. In less than 40 years the Hundred Years' War kicks off (in our time), and in less than 50 years time the Black Death comes a'knocking. As for Bob's priorities, 

What is the minimum land (island) required to support 6 person and enough animals for them. A lot. Let's assume a temperate climate, not tropical. The equivalent of, let's say, Boston, Mass. 40 to 50 inches of rain per year, and 5 months of winter (you can pretty reliably expect snow to fall, with subfreezing temperatures). During the 70's the consensus was that, for homesteading, about 5 acres was the minimum for sustainable self-sufficiency for a family of 4. So 6 people, all adults, would need about 10 to 20 acres, more or less. A good part of this requirement is for a woodlot, since you'll need to burn wood for cooking and heating. And if you want to raise something bigger than chickens, you'll need more land for grazing. And if you want draft animals so you can plow with them rather than have your people doing it, that's even more land to support them. For this sort of climate, you should figure on 4-5 acres per animal (horse or cow). The Irish, for instance, got by on less, but Ireland doesn't have freezing winters. Now, that is in part a conservative estimate. If you want to go the Irish Peasant route, living almost exclusively on potatoes and buttermilk, you'll need on the order of 1 acre. Food ration is about 8 to 10 pounds per day - and nothing else. And, of course, the woodlot needs to be considered. Although the numbers are not well-established, I've run across figures of ~ 1 cord/acre (+/-) for coppiced land. So 5 to 10 acres seems a reasonable estimate. A more serious problem is water. 10 acres is simply not enough to support decent surface water. After all, you can't dig wells in an oceanic island for water. You need enough land and vegetation to act as buffer and support both the area and relief needed to provide a water source. Frankly, I'm not competent to provide an answer to this aspect, but I'd be very surprised if anything less than 100 acres would work, and I'd be inclined to go for more. On the other hand, since this is an oceanic island, fishing will presumably provide a fair amount of food, and this will reduce the agricultural requirements. Enough to have agriculture need and solar panel or other necessary things for the rest of life. solar energy what ever.... And now we start running into trouble. Just exactly what standard of living are suggesting? Solar panels indicate either that the inhabitants won't be there for all that long (it's really hard to make solar panels after all, so they will wear out), or that they will expect to trade with an outside source for goodies like solar panels. In that case, they will need to provide excess produce in order to get their goodies, and the better their standard of living, the more they'll need to produce and the farther away from self-sufficient living they will be. 

Oh sure, he's the master of the elements, but is he the master of molecules? You arrange to have FedEx deliver a package to him. The package contains a powerful bomb, which will go off when opened. Primary explosive is TNT. Detonator is sodium azide. All parts for the initiator are plastic. The elements are carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen and sodium. In other words, nothing exotic, nothing out of the ordinary. If he is alerted by the presence of these elements he will spend all his time worrying about every animal that comes within 10 miles of him. If he won't let these elements near him he will starve to death. Alternatively, how about nerve gas? VX, for instance only takes about 10 mg to cause death, and its elements are hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, phosphorous and sulphur. Again, these are all characteristic of living organisms. Or, to keep things simple, a milligram of botulinum toxin in his food will do the trick, and that's just a standard protein, with no exotic elements. Actually, there are any number of organic toxins which will do the trick. Diphtheria toxin, for instance, will kill in concentrations of 0.1 ug/kg of body weight, so 10 ug is lethal in the bloodstream, but I'm not sure if ingestion will do the trick. 

A harpoon is any projectile with a barbed head and a line tied to it. This allows the projectile to remain embedded in the prey while the line is used to remain connected to the prey (fish it out of water for smaller fish, wear out and retrieve for whales). How the harpoon is launched is irrelevant. Crossbows aren't usually used for harpoons, but there's no intrinsic reason why it's impossible. 

I'm not sure exactly what you mean, and the uncertainty is important. By "currency", do you mean physical representations of money, such as Federal Reserve Notes or 5-pound notes? (This would seem to rule out bitcoins, which you have specifically mentioned.) Or are you talking about money in general? In the first case, the results would be traumatic, and in some cases disastrous, but possibly not catastrophic on the larger scales. The bulk of the US economy, for instance, runs on credit rather than cash. Credit cards and debit cards, direct deposit and direct debit would still work. However, any cash transactions would obviously come to a screeching halt until such time as the US Mint could print up replacement currency, and distribute it. Which is the problem. With no way to tell who had how much cash just before the Disappearance, that distribution would be a political nightmare. In the meantime, barter would hardly take up the slack, and IOUs would only find limited use, particularly in low-income areas. There are various reasons, ranging from low values of social trust to the problems that normally cash-dependent businesses would not be able to function in the absence of cash, so local workers (who need the cash to spend on food and such) would lose their jobs as the businesses folded. In other parts of the world, where cash is king, the results would be disaster. At the bottom of the economic ladder, subsistence farmers would be largely untouched. In the short term, they grow their own food and, if the seasons are right, won't starve immediately. The large concentrations of urban poor, though, will starve unless the local governments step up and organize distribution, and on the basis of disaster response history it does not seem likely that all of them will do so effectively. And I doubt that they'll go quietly. This is all very bad, but it gets much worse if money (in the general sense) disappears. All credit and debit cards lose function, and all bank accounts evaporate. Not only does money include credit, it includes debt. If it all disappears, among other things this eliminates the status of all mortgages and loans. For an enormous fraction of the economy, title to real assets becomes impossible determine. All economies above the level of barter work, to some degree, on trust. That is, if you give me money in exchange for a good or service, I'll only take it if I trust that I can find someone else who shares my opinion of what the money is worth. This includes a certain level of expectation that, if you've cheated me (by giving me counterfeit bills, for instance) that you'll end up in trouble with the Law, or that I'll be able to find you and take it out of your hide. If all the money has disappeared, replacing it would be a ticklish prospect - for instance, the temptation to start printing counterfeit bills would be enormous, and developing trust in total strangers is not an easy process.
