Cables have special ends on the brake lever / shifter lever side which you need in order to hook the cable into the lever. A brake cable end for mountain bikes looks like: 

I think its largely a style and personal preference thing, as well as carrying capacity these days. I find it a lot easier to find a reasonable sized messenger bag which can fit some books as well as my computer and a change of clothes than a decent sized backpack these days due to the monstrosity of those laptop compartments among other things. The riding style and conditions also come into play. Since a backpack has 2 (or possibly 3 straps if you have a chest strap), it doesn't move much when riding around (and I would be inclined to think that it balances the pressure on the straps better than a messenger bag - certainly, when I switched from backpack to messenger bag, I found it uncomfortable at first). A messenger bag can move to some degree (which is useful, if you're say a bike courier), but if you're riding on snow/ice (say, you're a winter commuter), a messenger bag can be a bit of a liability due to the mobility. There are "cross straps" that Timbuk2 sells for their bags which cinch the bag down to your body, which are useful for reducing this movement, but it is a bit more than a backpack even so. [The extreme version of this would be a messenger bag Camelbak, which probably wouldn't work for mountain biking well. ] 

The only way is to try it and find out. The great thing about disc wheels is that the brakes are in the same position regardless of rim size, so if you put the wheel in and it physically fits (i.e. it goes in the frame with enough clearance) and for the rear it has the right cassette, you're good to go (possibly with some minor adjustment to the brakes). If the outside diameter of the wheel with the tire on shrinks versus your 650b wheels with the 2.25" tires, it should work fine. If it grows, you may have to worry about clearance. You can check this by putting the wheels on top of each other. That being said, reducing tire size may not work so well for actual mountain biking, so if you are going to take it mountain biking rather than electric biking on the road, you may want to stick with the bigger 650b tires. 

Depends on the ride culture and how familiar people are. When I go riding with a group, its generally with a decent variation in riding ability and familiarity in riding in a group. Also, not everyone is familiar with routes always. So, we often split into two groups: one fast, another slow. Slowing down the fast group is boring. The slow group motivate each other to keep going at a reasonable pace. And if someone needs to stop (medical, puncture, etc.), the slow group often does. 

Aside from getting a TT specific bike, 1) Get a new seatpost which allows for more saddle adjustment 2) Get a new saddle are probably your options best options. I don't think the padding will help. When you added aero bars, you changed the riding geometry, and pretty much aside from swapping out stems/bars and tweaking heights there, your only other option is a new saddle and/or seatpost. I don't think the padding is a good idea, given that you shouldn't be sitting on that part of the saddle anyway. 

The correct tire pressure for you is typically not whats written on the tire sidewall. That's an arbitrary number determined by the marketing and legal departments at the tire manufacturer, not the engineers (usually it leads to an overinflated tire, which can damage the wheel and reduce control of the bike). You'll have to play with the pressure to get a properly inflated tire. Various manufacturers have rough guidelines for what pressures are good based on weight and tire size, but they're just guidelines -- you have to play with it on your own, since tire pressure is a personal preference (given that it is not under or over inflated -- a properly inflated tire absorbs hazards, doesn't pinch flat and has low rolling resistance, whereas an under inflated tire can pinch flat and also damage the wheel). A rule of thumb is that the rear tire should be 10% higher pressure than the front due to the load difference. You may also use different pressures depending on season or other conditions. As for how often you need to check your tire pressure, note that unless the tire is severely underinflated, you won't notice it by visual inspection or by just pushing on the tire (depending on what pressures you're running). I'd suggest using a floor pump with a pressure gauge and associating proper inflation with particular pressures for a given tire. You lose pressure from road hazards (e.g. if you hit a bump, some air might come out) as well as leaks (inner tubes and tires are porous to some extent, and valves leak a bit). The rate at which you lose air depends on your components and your rides. Ideally, you'd check before every ride, but for most people, weekly is a good enough option. 

It is likely that your cassette is worn. A new chain on a worn cassette will skip, because of the mismatch of the shape of the teeth on the cassette with the chain's spacing (which is shorter than what the cassette expects due to wear). You can visually inspect your cassette for wear by either looking for gaps in how the chain meshes with the cassette, or looking at the teeth to see that they aren't well shaped. 

You should read Zinn's articles (a, b, c, probably others) on 11 speed drivetrain compatibility. The surprising upshot is this: You can swap a Campagnolo 11 speed, Shimano 11 speed and SRAM 11 speed wheel in for each other and they will work (*). You can put SRAM and Shimano cassettes on each other's freehub bodies. The Shimano Ultegra CS-6800 comes in a 12-13-14-15-16-17-18-19-21-23-25, so this is a cassette you can buy and use. (*) Zinn notes there might be a tiny amount of indexing adjustment necessary. The SRAM/Shimano swap for wheels isn't really surprising, but the Campagnolo one is. 

I can see why this works to some extent [ the tube prevents air escaping through the edges of the rim as well as towards the spokes ], but I am curious about a few aspects of this: 

You could get locking skewers (e.g. pitlock) or skewers which have hex bolts (e.g. this) [obviously, having a hex key or a 15 mm wrench isn't really secure, but pitlock is more secure], if you want it for the security. But all you need to do is run down to your bike shop with your wheel+skewer and get them to match it to an appropriate solid axle in most cases if you really want a solid axle (since you didn't specify exactly which hub you have, we can't really give more details). 

Old Man Mountain sells a kit (PH-SH-F-THRU-BLUTO) for mounting their Phat Wide Sherpa Rack on the front with a RockShox Bluto fork (which your bike has). To quote the page: 

This is highly dependent on where you are. Generally, in the US, if you're on the road, you're subject to the standard vehicle regulations in the area (e.g. what applies to cars) you are in (with some possible modifications for bicycles at the city/town/county level or state level). In the town I live in, there are laws for running lights or stop signs on a bicycle or riding on the sidewalk in certain areas or whatever. You can also get fined/arrested for drunk cycling. Sometimes the police ignore these infarctions, in other times they catch you and write you a ticket (with fine) or a warning (moreso when it starts getting nice out, since people start to ride more) -- YMMV. [And running from the cops in the US is not a great idea.] On the other hand, if I went a few towns over, I'd be very surprised if a policeman stopped me for any of those issues (except for possibly drunk cycling; don't ride your bicycle drunk, folks). 

Cutting cables and housing is a bit of a pain in the ass (especially regular spiral housing for brakes). A Dremel with cutting disc or something like the Park Tool CN-10 is useful to cut the housing, along with a small file / punch to make sure that the hole is clear and smooth. The rules for running cables are here and here, along with some directions for cutting. Even if you do get a kit (e.g. this), you will still need to do some cutting, since bikes are of different sizes. Assuming your housings were sized appropriately before though, you just need to use them to size the new ones. Note that bad cable installation can drastically degrade performance / be dangerous if its on your brake systems. The cable cutting tools may not be a worthy investment if you don't use them often enough, so you may want to borrow them from a bike co-op or just get a shop to do it for you. 

For the rear, any Shimano shifter (for the right number of speeds) will work - the cable for the rear is the same between mountain and road. On the other hand, the front derailleurs have different cable pulls, and you need the flat bar road shifter (one of these). You can get the Sora set for 8 speed assuming your bike has an 8 speed cluster in the back (Shimano ST-R221 for the front , Shimano SL-R440-8 for the back). They are pricey though compared to their mountain brethren, and you only need the front one from that pair - the rear can be an 8 speed Alivio or something, but it wont look as nice (but function fine). Some alternatives for the front: depending on if you swap in a closer spaced crankset, you may be able to get a mountain FD to shift it and get a mountain set [depending on how the FD is mounted]. Or more simply, buy a friction shifter for the front and an index shifter for the back. A friction shifter is like 5 bucks for a thumb mounted one. Also, note that the riding position does change when you switch from drops to flats, so I'm assuming you've worked out those details already. 

When a crankset comes loose, stop riding immediately and tighten it. Even going a little distance can ruin the crankset and possibly the bottom bracket spindle. It sounds like in your case, the crankset is toast. We don't have enough information to say if you need a new bottom bracket or not (the Shimano BB-UN55/56 are standard square taper (ISO) bottom brackets and cost about 10-15 dollars), but you need to combine that with a square taper crankset. Alternatively, you can replace the bottom bracket to another standard rather than square taper (e.g. Hollowtech II) and get other cranksets with that standard. 

If you adjust a bike to the max and its still significantly too small, you should sell the bike and get a new bike. There are extra long seatposts, and extra long quill stems and what not, but in all likelihood its not really worth it if the bike doesn't fit with the normal seatpost + stem; the other parts of geometry like top tube length are probably too small anyway. 

That's because Triace is a BSO (Walmart bike). I'm surprised one would have a replacable derailleur hanger. If it does have a removable derailleur hanger, you're likely going to have try a generic derailleur hanger (disclaimer: no affiliation, never bought from them) or if it had quick release (unlikely), something like Problem Solvers' Universal Derailleur Hanger. If you post a picture of the broken derailleur hanger, someone may be able to match it to a good generic (or you can do that yourself). If the hanger is built into the frame and is just bent, you can use a crescent wrench to adjust it. If its built into the frame and broken off, time for a new frame (or if you're ambitious, you might be able to weld a new one on. 

Basically all the <=9 speed Shimano rear derailleurs are compatible with the <=9 speed Shimano shifters (excluding some old Dura-ace and a few other weird exceptions). So, you need to match: 1) Being within the capacities of the derailleur (max tooth, min tooth, chain capacity -- based on the chainring and cog sizes) 2) # of speeds on the shifter = # of cogs on the cassette As for needing a bigger hub, check that your hub is indeed a 7 speed hub; if so, you need a new hub (which a new wheel would likely be the upgrade route), but a lot of people have 7 speed cassettes on 8/9 speed hubs. Note that the cost of the new wheel may make the upgrade route not worth it economically (you're looking at the cost of a new shifter, new cassette, new chain and a new wheel). Based on the derailleur, the bike is probably close to 24 years old at this point, which makes it questionable to do these upgrades at all (and likely that you have an actual 7 speed cassette wheel, or maybe even a freewheel based bike, which would require an 8 speed freewheel or a new cassette wheel). I'd advise getting a newer bike from the get go instead and leaving this the way it is, if you want to do a 1x8 conversion. Also, there are other smokey grey derailleurs on the market from Shimano (e.g. in the Acera line). 

One thing about security is that bad security looks very close to good security a lot of the times (and assessing good security is often based on trust; if Bruce Schneier says a computer security system is good, you might feel okay about it; if Joe Schmoe on twitter says so, you probably wouldn't put any stake into it). So, do your research on any products that you may consider buying from quality sources. Also, be aware of your threat model. If you live in certain areas, things like these aren't going to be worth it cause the threat of people stealing wheels is negligible. In other areas, it may be redundant with the locking strategy you always have to employ. Anyway, things like security skewers and bolts are for relatively casual thieves; remember that you need to avoid them walking away with the whole bike first. 

If the tension is too high, the drivetrain will bind. If it is too low, the chain will drop (which is dangerous on a fixie, since it can catch and lock up the rear wheel relatively easily). You basically want the highest tension such that the drivetrain doesn't bind. See Sheldon Brown on how to set chain tension properly. 

If you're moving between Shimano and SRAM, the shifters and derailleurs all need to be purchased at the same time. The cassette and chain can stay provided they're the right number of speeds, but I do have a strong preference for SRAM chains whenever possible. That being said, if your bike is equipped with Tiagra, a better option would likely be sell it and buy something which shipped with Red anyway (or possibly buy a cheap donor bike from Nashbar/BikesDirect or similar with the Red components and strip it out, since the parts are individually quite expensive). 

You can drop in a compact crankset which has Hollowtech II compatibility. Otherwise, you can remove the existing bottom bracket and install a new one compatible with the crankset you buy. This site gives you a guide to all the bottom bracket types you can install in your frame (look under conventional threaded), in case you find you want to switch to another make of crankset. There are some other options though (which may be cheaper): 1) If you can live with a 50-39, you can find a 50t outer ring with the 130 BCD. This may be a bit cheaper, but you still need to adjust the FD. 2) You can put on a bigger rear cassette. If you have a short cage or medium cage rear derailleur, this may require a long cage rear derailleur (e.g. a 9 speed deore). 

No, you can't. The lowest Shimano level crankset with replacable chainrings is in the Acera group. In any case, most replacement chainrings cost about as much as a Tourney (or even Acera) crankset, so it doesn't make much sense to replace the chainrings on those anyway. As mentioned in the answer to your other question, theres a very good chance your bike won't be able to clear a 48t ring if it was originally spec'd with a 42t ring. 

They're not entirely the same bike (despite the model names). You have to engineer a disc brake fork to be reasonably stronger in some ways than a rim brake fork. You probably won't notice a difference in shifting or ergonomics once you get past a certain point (for a lot of people, I'd say this is Tiagra/105; however the psychology of having an ultegra shifter or whatever will make things feel smoother even if they aren't noticably smoother, for some people). The braking will be stronger with the disc brakes, and easier to stop if you ride in wet weather. On the other hand, repairing rim brakes just requires a few hex keys and a few minutes and anyone can do it (vs a hydraulic system). Really though, you have to try both bikes in the context you'll use them. You may like one better than the other. You also have to think about how teh disc brake and rim brake bikes cost the same -- disc brifters+brakes are more expensive than their rim counterparts, along with the cost of the wheels and stuff. So, where is the rest of the stuff being cut down in price?
