The nerve functor does not preserve homotopy colimits. Indeed, take any simplicial set $X$ with non-trivial $\pi_n$ ($n > 1$) and consider $X$ as a simplicial diagram of sets. In $\mathbf{sSet}$, its homotopy colimit will be $X$ (up to weak equivalence, by the Bousfield–Kan theorem), but the nerve of any 1-groupoid has trivial $\pi_n$ ($n > 1$). The fundamental groupoid functor does not preserve homotopy limits. As Matthias Wendt explained, the loop space can be computed by a homotopy limit, so if we choose a simplicial set $X$ with trivial $\pi_0$ and $\pi_1$ but non-trivial $\pi_2$, then the homotopy pullback diagram $$\begin{array}{ccc} \Omega X & \rightarrow & \Delta^0 \\ \downarrow & & \downarrow \\ \Delta^0 & \rightarrow & X \end{array}$$ cannot be preserved by the fundamental groupoid functor. 

About learning about logarithmic integral and polylogarithm identities, there are large compendium of formulae on everything (Gradstein Ryzhik Jeffreys for instance), a few classic monographies such as Nielsen, Lewin, some new books (some of them with a physicist point of view since polylogarithm appear when dealing with Feynman path integrals among others) and also this online resource. You can print the pdf version of this list of dilogarithm identities for instance. 

Just to stress a few points already addressed in comments and answers: Euler in his time discovered many important facts and solutions to classical questions, advanced rigor and gave examples of the power of the recently created methods (infinitesimal calculus), popularized the science of his day (notably books dedicated to a German Princess), wrote some of the first textbooks in analysis (still pleasant reading today), gave strength to the prussian and russian academy of science, courtized by two of the most powerful powers of the day (the King of Prussia and the Czar of Russia), filled international academic journals, some of them he edited himself, with quality articles (in fact up to several decades after his death because of the sheer size of his output), fostered international cooperation, wrote in the most important languages of his day (latin, french, german, I think he also learned russian), published in applied science, was part of state scientific advisory commission, etc. In fact Euler's work has been instrumental in progressively establishing the "rigor" some of us are so proud of. So a better equivalent of his investigation of what we call now Zeta(2 n) and the Gamma function would be the solution of outstanding problems by one of the most recognized mathematician of his day building on recent work by one of his even more famous and established mathematician, Bernoulli, who was his PhD advisor and whose several family members have established positions in the scientific community. I think he would have no difficulty publishing it. And his work would be quickly read and commented upon by many other mathematicians. Even if we imagine a Leonard Euler finding himself straight-jacketed by the mathematical discourse and style of the XXIst century, he would pair up with another good mathematician to write scholarly articles, as Ramanujan and Hardy used to do at the beginning of the XXth in a mutually benefical couple. 

It might not be the context you want (although if you think about this, it might be very close to what you want) but for some people a non-commutative bundle is a Banach bundle with non-commutative fibres. unlike a fibre bundle, the fibres are not necessarily isomorphic. Also bundles related to categories of Morita equivalence bimodules might be related at to the context I'm referring to because Connes' differential calculus is built into Morita equiv bimodules. The latter is a way to generalise the "tangent bundle" over the space described by A. I'm not an expert. Anyway, this approach seems to be working. 

There is a french talk by Alexander Zvonkin which can be a good introduction to this subject as well. If readers are interested I can translate parts of it in english. 

Since all the known non-trivial zeroes of Riemann Zeta function are on the Re(z)=1/2 line we only give their imaginary parts, but in fact their are complex, $$1/2+ i*14.1347251417346937904572519835624702707842571156992431756855674601499...$$ being the first above the real line. If Riemann Hypothesis is true we will never have to mention a different real part. 

Still another formulation: I recall hearing the whole idea being referred by a metaphor of skeleton and flesh. The "mass" of your example would be the "skeleton weight" or "bone mass" of the collection, the amount of "flesh" around each "bone" (the radius of the muscle ?) being the size of the automorphism group. I find the groupoid cardinality sensible too and perfectly compatible with the basic results of Polya theory, and will certainly use it in the future. I note that this is the converse operation of counting things with multiplicities such as roots. 

This is an open question and it's to find out who is interested in this kind of thing, who can benefit from thinking about this. It is very brief but hopefully will only be unclear to people who are not into this anyway. Briefly, we can think of a Morita category (with object C*-algebras and morphisms bimodules) as a "weak" groupoid. It seems to me one can put a topology on the object space by thinking of it as a Banach bundle or continuous field of C*-algebras, which comes with a topological structure. This should satisfy axioms of a Grothendieck site (a topology on a category). So I think one can use this to define a weak topological groupoid. What about a weak differentiable groupoid or Lie groupoid? We can consider comparing this structure (with a certain sheaf over the site of objects) to a spectral triple with the geometrical data in the Dirac operator. I will stop to keep this short. This should lead to something closely related to Quillen's point of view on cyclic cohomology where the spectral triple algebra is also related to a Grothendieck site. The motivation is coming from Crane's "quantum geometries" for quantum gravity and I think there are unexplored conceptual intersections between category theory and non-commutative geometry. Thanks for reading! Sorry if this is not a math overflow type question but there is an indication that we may ask open questions. 

Since each $\textbf{Set}_\lambda$ is a priori a different category, there is no reason to believe that limits and colimits in $\textbf{Set}_\lambda$ will agree with limits and colimits in $\textbf{Set}_\kappa$, if $\lambda \lt \kappa$. Fortunately, it is a fact that if $\mathcal{D}$ is a full subcategory of $\mathcal{C}$, and the limit (resp. colimit) $X$ of a diagram in $\mathcal{D}$ exists in $\mathcal{C}$, then as long as $X$ is in $\mathcal{D}$, $X$ will be the limit (resp. colimit) of that diagram in $\mathcal{D}$. In more sophisticated words, the inclusion of a full subcategory always reflects limits and colimits. The trouble is that it may not preserve limits and colimits. None of the categories $\textbf{Set}_\lambda$ have all small limits or colimits. This is due to an observation of Freyd: a small category with all small limits (or colimits) is a preorder category. However, it has all internally-indexed limits and colimits, in the following sense: if $\mathbb{C}$ is an internal category in $\textbf{Set}_\lambda$, meaning $\operatorname{ob} \mathbb{C}$ and $\operatorname{mor} \mathbb{C}$ are sets in $\textbf{Set}_\lambda$, and $A : \mathbb{C} \to \textbf{Set}_\lambda$ is an internal diagram (see [CWM, Ch. XII, § 1]), then $\varprojlim A$ and $\varinjlim A$ both exist in $\textbf{Set}_\lambda$ via the usual construction. In particular, every $\textbf{Set}_\lambda$ is closed under finite limits and colimits. Though $\textbf{Set}_\lambda$ is a small category, it is not an internal category in $\textbf{Set}_\lambda$ itself! Instead, we must go up the hierarchy in order to realise $\textbf{Set}_\lambda$ as an internal category. This a priori seems to mean that we cannot talk about a genuine functor $\mathbb{C} \to \textbf{Set}_\lambda$, where $\mathbb{C}$ is an internal category in $\textbf{Set}_\lambda$, without leaving $\textbf{Set}_\lambda$, and once we leave $\textbf{Set}_\lambda$ we have to worry about whether the results obtained in a bigger category $\textbf{Set}_\kappa$ are still valid in our original category $\textbf{Set}_\lambda$, cf discussions about "change of universe" in SGA. To be clear, this is a non-trivial problem. It is not so easy to replace a genuine functor $\mathbb{C} \to \textbf{Set}_\lambda$ with an internal diagram in $\textbf{Set}_\lambda$. For example, let $\omega \to \textbf{Set}_{\omega + \omega}$ be the functor $n \mapsto \omega + n$. The obvious way of turning this into an internal diagram uses the axiom of replacement and results in a set of rank at least $\omega + \omega$ – in other words, it is not internal to $\textbf{Set}_{\omega + \omega}$! Nonetheless, for cardinality reasons, it is true that every genuine functor $\mathbb{C} \to \textbf{Set}_\lambda$ is isomorphic to an internal diagram in $\textbf{Set}_\lambda$. 

Pedro Resende understands this well. The interchange law in a double algebra (defined by Resende) is not satisfied by a double groupoid convolution algebra but I think that doesn't necessarily mean that a category fibred over the double groupoid is not a double category. So you can drop the interchange law, well at least that is what we considered doing. In the end it seemed that the idea of a weak Hopf algebra by Natale and Andruskiewitsch was the best approach! (So there is already a counterpart of a Hopf algebra for a group coming from coproduct if not a counterpart of a group convolution algebra coming from product.) 

Write $G_0$ (resp. $G_1$) for the set of objects (resp. morphisms) in $\mathbb{G}$. There is a Galois topology on these making $\mathbb{G}$ a topological groupoid: 

I work in a general pointed model category. The homotopy fibre of a morphism $f : Y \to X$ can be defined as follows: first, choose a fibrant replacement $w_X : X \to \hat{X}$ and then factor $w_X \circ f : Y \to \hat{X}$ as a weak equivalence $w_Y : Y \to \hat{Y}$ followed by a fibration $\hat{f} : \hat{Y} \to \hat{X}$; then the homotopy fibre (with respect to these choices) is the ordinary fibre of $\hat{f} : \hat{Y} \to \hat{X}$. Thus, we have the following commutative diagram, $$\require{AMScd} \begin{CD} \operatorname{fib} f @>>> Y @>{w_Y}>> \hat{Y} @<<< \operatorname{hfib} f\\ @VVV \mathrm{pb} @VV{f}V @V{\hat{f}}VV \mathrm{pb} @VVV \\ 0 @>>> X @>>{w_X}> \hat{X} @<<< 0 \end{CD}$$ and in particular, we get a comparison $\operatorname{fib} f \to \operatorname{hfib} f$ making the following diagram commute: $$\begin{CD} \operatorname{fib} f @>>> \operatorname{hfib} f \\ @VVV @VVV \\ Y @>>{w_Y}> \hat{Y} \end{CD}$$ If you can choose $(\hat{X}, w_X, \hat{Y}, w_Y, p)$ functorially, then you get a homotopy fibre functor, and it can be shown to be a right homotopical approximation of the fibre functor. This is the "global" universal property. The "local" universal property is more or less built into the definition I give above. One way of getting a feel for it is to think about what happens at the level of the homotopy category: in this case, it says that, for any morphism $g : Z \to Y$ such that $f \circ g = 0$ in the homotopy category, there is a (not necessarily unique) morphism $Z \to \operatorname{hfib} f$ making the evident diagram commute (in the homotopy category). But, of course, this is not a complete characterisation of $\operatorname{hfib} f$. 

I would also advise (especially if they were published in french journals, such as the articles by Elie Cartan, Frechet, Henri Cartan) GALLICA and NUMDAM You can often download whole articles, depending on date and copyright. Here you have an obituary for Sophus Lie in the Weekly Accounts of the French Science Academy in 1899 (CRAS 1899, p525). 3 important original articles from Sophus Lie, probably on GDZ for the first 2. Sophus Lie, Über Complexe, insbesondere Linien- und Kugel-Complexe, mit Anwendung auf die Theorie partieller Differentialgleichungen; Mathematische Annalen Vol 5, pp145- 256 (1872) Sophus Lie, Untersuchungen über Transformationsgruppen. II; Archiv for Mathematik og Naturvidenskab vol 10, pp353-413 (Kristiania 1886) Sophus Lie, unter Mitwirkung von Friedrich Engel, Theorie der Transformationsgruppen III, 1895. Printed as a book I think. I have it as chapters in the Chelsea reprint. 

Hi Mirco, I'm putting my comment as an answer in case otherwise you don't find it. I wonder if you need the "n-arrows-only" approach.... where language of partial monoids replace categories. For example where objects and 1-arrows are treated on the same footing as 2-arrows in a double or 2-category in which the identities are provided by the source and target maps. Proposition: A small double category is precisely a set with two commuting partial monoid structures. (And a 2-category similarly but with an extra condition.) Would it be at all useful to you to try to do this for the n-fold or for the n case? 

The Bloch constant B (based on a theorem introduced by André Bloch in 1925 on the maximum radius of a one-to-one disk in the image of a normalized analytic function of the unit disk, see for instance Remmert Funktionentheorie II or Steven Finch marvelous "Mathematical Constants") was conjectured by Ahlfors to be $$ \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+\sqrt{3}}}\frac{\Gamma(\frac{1}{3})\Gamma(\frac{11}{12})}{\Gamma(\frac{1}{4})}$$ (This value, if I remember well Ahlfors' article corresponds to a particular function that he constructed for this purpose). The Bloch Constant $B$ is currently known to be at least slightly greater than $\frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}$ (several articles improving upon each other by Mario Bonk, Chen and Gauthier, Xiong). Has there been some progress since 1998 on the lower bound ? Same question for the closely related (univalent) Landau constant (quite often called Bloch-Landau constant, sometimes seen as $B_\infty$) ? The conjectured upper bound is $$\frac{\Gamma(\frac{1}{3})\Gamma(\frac{5}{6})}{\Gamma(\frac{1}{6})}$$
