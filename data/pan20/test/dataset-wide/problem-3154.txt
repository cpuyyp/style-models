They didn't try because it wasn't politically relevant to them (i.e. The Emperor wasn't interested). Chinese dynasties preferred a tributary network instead of European or Pan-Arabic style colonisation. This reasoning worked well enough considering the key motivation for Europeans traders to sail beyond Europe was to bypass Arabic tariffs on the Silk Road and connect with Sinae (China) directly. From the Emperor's standpoint, foreign traders came to them. The Chinese tributary system didn't collapse until the 19th century Opium Wars pushed European foreign policies on China. Tianxia ("All is equal under heaven") is an intriguing political concept and explains much of China's diplomatic philosophy to this day; and at the risk of drifting into History's twin, Futurology, is proving appealing to certain emerging nations that are more comfortable with Chinese soft power instead of American hard power. 

Historiographically, viewing history through a progressive lens is as over-generalised as viewing history through a conservative, Marxist or Ayn Rand lens. However the term "Whig History" is used as a slur. An Ye Olde Tory criticism of history blending into the future, in the manner of Cosmopolitanism, Technological Progressivism or Post-Humanism. The prevalence and negativity of the term may also reflect scholarly frustration with the common popularity of the "We are the best and getting better" view of history; and the idea that pure "unpolluted" historians are not supposed to use or know about Cultural Relativity (a/k/a History is Now). The core concern should be whether history is being viewed through a particular lens to tease out certain novel insights (good) or to bury certain contradictions of the supporting ideology (bad). A good author will usually state which lens they are using and why. If they have done so, then people tagging them as 'Whig Historians' meant it as a slur or as a thought-terminating cliche instead of a neutral descriptive term; if the term can retain any neutrality. The historical qualities of a work* should of course be assessed in the usual way. * Blaming fiction authors of 'Whig History' beggars belief. As if the reader or critic forgot what part of the library they were in. Or that most authors and readers don't strive to suck all the joy and hope out of past, present and future events. 

The era of the Grand Tour was rife with banditry; and yet the rite of passage remained popular amongst the aristocracy. What reported methods did nobles use to either evade banditry or mitigate the outcome? Popular route for 18th century English nobles: 

Matters of language are probably best handled elsewhere, so I'll try to answer the question that I think is answer-able here: 

Has a person elected to the US Presidency ever held a government position in a nation besides the United States? I think any government-related role would be an interesting answer. I think the focus here is the role acts as a representative of the country, or to officially influence sovereign matters. I do not think the role must have been voted by the people of that nation. 

Because of the complex inter-linking of planetary calendar phases (sun, moon, venus, mars, saturn, mercury), certain calendrical intersections were times for sacrifices. Places where the count reset itself (such as the 2012 long-count incrementation) were also times for awareness. Since many of these intersections are dictated by solar cycles, the seasons sacrifices would have had special meaning at these epagomenal times. 

The ritual calendar(s) are quite detailed, with minor differences between cultures. The Maya were no special case in the following list, because the ritual calendar was more-or-less driven by the imperialism of the Aztec empire. Simply, the 'corners of the year' (solstices and equinoxes) were the major ritual times because the sacrifices governed the prosperous / abundant transition of the seasons. Omens were another large governor of sacrifices: 

There are other examples of inter-nation games in the Native American nations, though not as ancient as the Grecian games. Also, I have heard pro and con arguments on the idea that these sporting events were used to solve disputes and other 'inter-national' planning without deadly warfare. One example of such an inter-nation game is Pasuckuakohowog. It was like football, and involved thousands of players (e.g. many nations). Other games, like Chunkey, were played as far back as the 600's CE. 

Carbohydrates were the basis for nutrition stores (silos), which were not possible with meats and fruits/vegetables due to availability. Such storage allows longer forays (time spent doing an activity rather than gathering/preparing food); which probably enabled more scouting/exploration, conquest, design / 'science'. People today do not need to eat so much grain / carbs. Our nutrition only expanded since agriculture. So we cannot say that we had better nutrition back then. I suppose you could try to argue that, per capita, nutrition was better. This argument would require proving that fewer meats, fruits and vegetables exist per-capita today than in pre-agricultural times. If you cannot show that, then the situation is purely that we have more options for nutrition today (and possibly worse choices) 

These geographical fabrications are not new; the slabs of ice, rock and tundra that make up Greenland was named "Greenland" by Erik the Red to encourage settlement. 

Christopher Columbus thought the world was spherical (like most educated people of his era) but he also thought the size of the Earth was small enough that a westward boat trip from Europe to Asia was achievable with existing ship building technology. In this regard he differed from the more accurate size estimates of scholars in Isabella and Ferdinand's court. Sustained lobbying won out through - and so off he went. Since he still believed the size of the Earth was small - when he bumped into land in the Americas obviously he would assert that the landfall was in Asia (India, Japan, China or somewhere) as: 

Probably no. Introduction of Yoga in earnest to the West only occurred from the late 1920s onwards. The likelihood of any of the few early adopters being on the Titanic is low; especially as no Indian nationals were on the passenger manifest. 

For the purpose of this question, let us assume that is meant in the Hobbesian self-preservation and standard-of-living sense of the word; instead of a more pure free-will or pacifist sense. As in a pure pacifist sense Rome of course wasn't obliged to do anything; including survive, retain autonomy or feed its citizens. 

Yes. Especially if international means movements across what would later become national or colonial boundaries. A lot of modern Arabic and eventually resurgent Islamic consciousness arose from the collapse of the Ottoman Empire. The success of revolutionaries, like Hussein bin Ali* to frame pan-Arabic nationalism as an Islamic revitalisation versus the mostly secular bureaucracy of the late-stage Ottoman Empire, allowed for aspiration towards new Islamic Golden Age. The contraction of the British and French Empires a few decades later had a similar effect on regional sentiment. The Cold War simply brought home that neither the USA nor USSR were honest brokers for Muslim interests. Islam was always an international movement; the USA managed to selectively breed militancy into the international milieu by funding and training specifically those Muslims willing to kill for their religion. Because fundamentalist Islam is a repellent doctrine (like all religious fundamentalism); the mainstream Western narrative tends to forget that the modern Islamist movement is also quintessentially an anti-imperialist movement. The "international Islamist movements" have existed as long as European interests in the Middle East have. * Of Lawerence of Arabia fame. 

If I were in your shoes, I would pay for this even if your relatives cannot. I would travel to be with them for the start of this process, and when the conservationist arrives - so that my relatives understood that I share their values regarding this documentation of birthright. Advice I glean that you do not have much affection for the noble system nor the meaning of your family's title. I encourage you not to push on your relatives regarding matters that I have outlined are against their values, as this will only distance you from them and limit the positive impact that you can have on the preservation of this relic. Apologize to them for any insult, and affirm that you will help them with proper preservation, within their household, under them control. Convey to them how lack of a consultant conservationist could risk the condition of this document. It has survived 500 years â€” ensure that it can survive no less than 500 more. 

It is right to understand that this book is a book of title. Internal Affairs First, your assertions that this belongs in a museum are very-evidently part of your friction with those relatives regarding documentation or movement of the book. Many families treat these relics with intense protection, and would consider any outside personnel purely as consultants in the preservation of their family's relics. To such a mindset, transferring such document to another person, even as a service, is maybe what we can call a 'secular form of sacrilege'. If you are uncomfortable with that or cannot grok it, you will not be able to ally with you relatives in any significant way on this matter. In some societies, noble title grants a birthright to land, political interaction, or other affairs. I do know know Spain's noble system well enough to say more. For people that value their family's history with this kind of 'hallowed' conscience, the suggestion that such a relic be appraised for monetary value is just plain insulting. One could ask the question "You would peddle your birthright for a meal?" Preservation I cannot say yes/no if relinquishing this documentation of title to a museum would forfeit your family's title within the royal system of Spain. Preservation of this relic is absolutely critical. If you family has no money to preserve the document, and they have no care for their noble rights, then turning the document over to a museum is a [small] gift to the nation of Spain, as it preserves the history. Preserving History is, itself, an 'act of noble stature'. But preserving the document within the family is the more respectable thing to do. You are correct that a preservationist should come in to inspect the relic and evaluate:
