There is some overlap here with ChrisW's answer. The point I would like to emphasize is that for both monks and lay persons, there are benefits of admirable friendship. Admirable friendship is important for both monks and lay persons, so that they may be positively influenced by the wholesome and skillful qualities of their admirable companions. With admirable friendship, a lay person could progress on the right path according to AN 8.54: 

Please see this answer about a video talk by Yuttadhammo Bhikkhu on addiction to pornography and addiction in general. That answer also states: 

Firstly, Buddhist monks are subject to rules. The Theravada monk has to follow the 227 Patimokkha rules. Of course, for other traditions, it may be different. Some of these rules can be quite detailed like the following: 

Let me add on to rob_mtl's good answer. Firstly, diabetes type 2 is a disease that seems to be reversible and curable by changing one's diet to have less carbohydrates and to be replaced with more fats and proteins. Please see this YouTube TED talk. Interestingly, the Buddha gave similar advice to King Pasenadi of Kosala 2500 years ago, in the Donapaka Sutta, at least with regard to reducing carbohydrate intake. Sometimes, Buddhist teachings can be very down-to-earth and practical. A similar question to your's, was asked by householder Nakulapita to the Buddha in the Nakulapita Sutta: 

So, it is not that negative situations stop happening when you practice or even become enlightened, but rather, you face them differently. This applies to both health and other types of situations. Also see this answer. In the Nakulapita Sutta: 

My analogy: If you play a video game, you would be fully engrossed in the role of the character that you are playing. But when you decide to stop playing, you can immediately and instantaneously disassociate yourself from the character. You don't carry with you the identity of that video game character, or crave to become it. To say that the video game character has a self or has no self, are both wrong views, because it depends on what frame of reference you would use to make that determination. Instead, I would say that in all parts of the game, it is empty of a self. While the Buddha figured this out and stopped playing when the current "game round" is over, we are still stuck, and having the mistaken self-identity as the video game character, and craving its existence, thus coming back in future "game rounds" endlessly. Just as in the Suñña Sutta: 

The Noble Eightfold Path is balanced in the development of virtue (sila), concentration (samadhi) and panna (wisdom). Sila is composed of Right Speech, Right Action and Right Livelihood. Samadhi is composed of Right Effort, Right Mindfulness and Right Concentration. Panna is composed of Right View and Right Resolve / Intention. The forerunner of the path is Right View. The path includes the cultivation of wisdom and insight, in order to uproot the ten fetters. In order to pursue both insight and concentration, first virtues (sila) must be well-established according to the Kimattha Sutta. Lay people are not discouraged from meditation - please see this answer. There are also more tips regarding meditation involving the use of the middle way, including getting moderate sleep, food and sensual experiences, according to the tips by Yuttadhammo Bhikkhu in Chapter Six of his book "How to Meditate", which is entitled "Daily Life". Perhaps, you want to review your progress so far, and ask yourself if you are truly progressing in a balanced way, taking into account all eight parts of the Noble Eightfold Path. The path to the end of suffering should not be reduced to meditation only. Experiencing fear of losing your self, is a sign that you may not be ready yet to go deeper, or your path is not balanced. I can't tell you what is not right - you may need to find a proper teacher to instruct you further. A proper teacher should ensure that you continue on the Middle Way with the Right View, rather than falling into either extremes of practice (over-asceticism) or extremes of view (eternalism or annihilationhism). It is also possible that when you are ready to go deeper, it makes more sense to leave the lay life (which is incompatible with losing interest in material concerns) and move to becoming a anagarika or novice monk, adhering to the Eight Precepts or Ten Precepts. 

And vice versa. On being compelled further, the Buddha stated that the one who lived his life behaving like a dog, thinking like a dog and having the mind of a dog, fully and without break, will either be born in the company of dogs in future, or in hell. And similarly for one who lived his life behaving like a cow. As ChrisW has said, the reason why he says "enough" seems to be that he doesn't want to have to tell them that they'll be reborn in hell or the animal realm. 

So, DN15 says that name-and-form is the condition for consciousness, which is the condition for name-and-form, which is the condition for contact. This is in the looped version of Dependent Origination. Based on Piya Tan's explanation, the first name-and-form is from the previous life, which is the condition for consciousness. This consciousness, at death, is what the Abhidhamma calls cuti-citta or the "death consciousness" of the previous life, and is the same patisandhi citta or "rebirth consciousness" of the new life. This consciousness, is the requisite condition for the name-and-form of the next life. The second name-and-form is therefore the name-and-form of the next life. This is very clearly proven by the DN15 quote: 

Over-excessive indulgence in social media could be akin to habitual partying, with potential exposure to bad companionship and potentially increasing laziness. According to the Sigalovada Sutta: 

Hence, it is not the size of the modern Sangha or congregation of Buddhists that is the problem, but rather it is whether they really follow the teachings or not. The book "The Broken Buddha" by Ven. Shravasti Dhammika provides good information on how parts of the Sangha and the Buddhist World today may not be reflecting the original ideals put forward by the Buddha. 

Sure, you can make money and enjoy from it and make yourself happy. There's more financial advice from the Dighajanu Sutta: 

Sex, murder, theft and false representation of one's spiritual progress constitutes the worst transgression (parajika offenses) that results in the monk's ipso facto expulsion. The rules regarding attire: 

There is a good discussion of the Middle Way in this answer. The Middle Way is not a moderation between the goal of ending suffering and the goal of enjoying material pleasures. There is only one goal in Buddhism, which is attaining permanent happiness through ending suffering. There is no other goal. To achieve this goal, the Middle Way of practice is prescribed by the Buddha, in between extreme ascetism and extreme indulgence, and is shown in the Noble Eightfold Path. The monastic order (which requires renouncing worldly possessions) is just a more intensive training program to achieve the goal of ending suffering. It is designed for faster progress in achieving the goal. However, it is not mandatory. Both lay people and monks can progress in their path, following the Noble Eightfold Path. The Buddha did not shun the worldly or lay life. For example, you can see how Buddha provided advice on financial management and economics in this answer, this answer and this answer. In the Sigalovada Sutta, the Buddha taught: 

Firstly, does your profession fulfill the requirements of Right Livelihood? If your work or business is not in weapons, human trading, meat, intoxicants, poison or anything in the spirit thereof, then it is fulfilling Right Livelihood. For now, I assume yes. Secondly, although your profession fulfills Right Livelihood, the State requires and compels you to pay tax. So here, you do not have the intention to willingly contribute money to the government, but you do so because you are forced to and because you are a law-abiding citizen. Thirdly, you have the opportunity to influence how your tax money is spent through the elections. So, here I assume that you have voted in the past at the ballot box (assuming that you are eligible to do so). It doesn't matter who got elected, as long as you have done your part. Fourthly, you still have the opportunity to vote using your feet and move or migrate to another place. However, the main point in my opinion is that, what the government does with the tax money, is not caused by your intentions and you did not pay tax with the intention of contributing towards warfare etc. Rather, you paid tax because you were compelled to do so. The commentary on the story of the hunter's wife from Dhammapada 124 is relevant here. 

Life is not suffering. There is suffering. Perhaps you can say that existence is suffering and that would be more accurate, but a detailed study would show that the Buddha taught that "there is suffering" but did not say that it is life that is the suffering or that it is existence that is the suffering. If it were, then you can simply end that suffering by suicide. This also relates to the question of who is suffering and because of whose actions. Life is sometimes happy and sometimes sad. Both the happy and sad times do not last forever. It's not always sad. Craving is not the direct cause of suffering. How craving is the cause of suffering, can be understood through dependent origination. Please see here for details. 

So, the Buddha did not tell his followers to pray to him for salvation. Rather he told them to depend on the Dhamma and their own effort for enlightenment. The Buddha told Vakkali (in the Vakkali Sutta): 

The goal in Buddhism is the end of suffering. But why do you want to reach the end of suffering? The reason is to attain the only permanent happiness, which is Nibbana. So, the mission in Buddhism is really the pursuit of happiness. The Buddha discovered that both over-indulgence and over-asceticism are not conducive to the path to the end of suffering. So, he prescribed the middle way through the Noble Eightfold Path. If you follow the middle way, you can have long term, medium term and short term goals of happiness. The long term goal associated with this mission is attaining Nibbana (permanent happiness). It might take multiple births, maybe even aeons to achieve this. The medium term goal would be to try to achieve: at least stream entry for Theravada and strong cultivation of Bodhicitta for Mahayana. You can also get more info on stream entry in this YouTube video talk. The short term goal would be to try to achieve and maintain happiness in this life and future lives (which includes avoiding unfortunate rebirths). At the very minimum, you need to keep the five precepts with heedfulness (appamada). Going a little further, you need to practise more of virtue (sila) with heedfulness (appamada). This short term goal is described in the Ittha Sutta:
