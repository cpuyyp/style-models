Write up a report on all the issues, with recommendations for fixing them. Present it to senior management. When people question your ability, or you are being evaluated in future, you can cite this report as evidence of your attempts to improve the situation and how you are doing the best you can with what you have. 

Search engines can help you. Google has tools to help you do this. I don't think Google is blocked in Hong Kong, but if it is you can always use a Chinese search engine like Baidu to similar effect. Google offers an option to display only results from Hong Kong (enter search terms, hit enter, tools menu, country selection). If you have a Google account you can also specify which languages you want results in, so limit it to English. Then search for English terms like "jobs" and "english speaking". When I tried this I saw several sites such as www.indeed.hk and jobsinhongkong.com that are dedicated to English speaking users, and have options to filter by jobs that accept English-only applicants. Similarly, you can search for phrases like "location hong kong". Combined with "careers" or "recruitment" that seems to turn up a few employers with offices there. 

Send them another message giving a date for the end of your employment. State clearly that you will cease to work for them after that date. Make sure you have evidence that it was received, e.g. registered mail or email reading receipt. That's all you need to do. If they fail to act it's their problem. Concentrate on your next job. 

Your health is the most important thing by far. Stress can result in permanent health problems if not treated, so don't try to soldier on if your doctor advises you not to. I have a permanent, incurable disability caused by stress, so learn from my mistake. From an employment point of view mental health issues are no different to physical ones, e.g. if you broke your leg or got the flu. You have a date when you expect to be recovered that you can give to your new employer. In a way it's actually a good test of the new employer, to see how they handle this issue. If they handle it badly, maybe they are not the best place for you. Hopefully they will be understanding, I think the Netherlands is a pretty progressive place when it comes to mental health issues. 

In large part, this is going to depend upon the rules in your office and the laws in your area. In the United States, the Family Medical Leave Act, or FMLA, could potentially be in play here. In the State of Washington, the Washington Family Care Act imposes additional rules when it comes to sick leave. Unless you are say going to be out for an extended period of time, because of either a planned or unplanned major medical issue, it's generally accepted most places to call in each and every day you are out sick. If it were me, I would have called in sick each and every day that I was out sick. The means of notification will also vary from one organization and supervisor to the next. Some will insist upon a live human being speaking to another live human being over the phone. Others are fine with voice mail or Email notifications. Increasingly, I see Email notifications as superior as I routinely see instances of people calling in sick, getting voice mail, and the person who gets the voice mail is themselves out of the office--either for sick or other purposes. I personally send an Email to the Team Email Distribution List, which includes both my supervisor and my coworkers. In my view, this provides for the greatest possibility of someone who needs to get hold of me getting the message that I won't be in the office that day. As for what to say, as a Union Shop Steward I tell people to be brief and not go into details. This is especially true with FMLA, but it is serves everyone best if the information is brief. "I am out sick today." "My child is sick today." "My elderly parent is sick today." 

Most organizations have policies that may, I stress may, apply here. First, when you say "offensive comments", do you mean profanity or threats? If they are using profanity in the workplace, Management and HR might be interested and want to put a stop to that. Now, with that said, every office is different, and if a person let's a few profane words slip out now and again, it might not be enough to warrant any sort of intervention. You should really consider what are the normative behaviors. In other words, is what these people say within the norms of your workplace? If yes, then move along on this point. Threats can be analogous to profanity in that they are something no one wants to hear, but in the course of day to day language they are much more acceptable than even profanity. "I could kill my dry cleaner. He ruined another suit." "This idiot driving in the slow lane today should be shot, and I'm willing to do it." "For all the money my wife spends on clothes, I should divorce her. No kill her first, then divorce her." People have these sorts of outbursts that can be very commonplace. Once again, if what the people in question are saying fits within workplace norms, move along. A second line of thought is whether the offensive comments are creating an undue workplace interruption for you. If so, then both Management and HR are more likely to take an interest because that impacts the bottomline if the work isn't getting done. As with profanity and threats, you must consider whether the behavior fits within workplace norms. Do they talk about their rotten kids for a few minutes at a time a few days out of the month at their workspace? Do they talk about their rotten kids for two to four hours at a time each and every day at their workspace? In between these two extremes lies the reality. If it's closer to the former, move along. If it's closer to the latter, then you definitely need to raise it up to Management and HR under the context of workplace interruption. 

It is unlikely that you will be able to get the salary you want from your current employer, and even if you could get it do you think your boss will be looking to give you a decent pay rise next year? Sadly, leaving is probably your best option. Low pay jobs often are quite good in terms of work environment, because higher pay usually implies more responsibility and thus a more "serious" attitude. 

You should avoid sharing your current salary details. It can only ever work against you. All that information will be used for is to calibrate the offer they make you to be as low as possible while still tempting you away from your current job. This punishes people who are loyal (switching jobs often usually increases salary faster than yearly raises) and who are underpaid. Remember that stating your current salary is the start of your salary negotiation. They will likely offer you around 10% more as a starting point. Its in your best interest not to start with a low number like that and try to work up, justifying a larger increase. You should give them your desired salary for the company in question, which will depend on location (cost of living/rent), type of work and what non-monetary benefits they offer. 

When applying for jobs far from where you live, it can be time consuming and expensive to travel to interviews. What is the best way to prepare for this and determine if it is worthwhile? The usual advice is to avoid mentioning disabilities or discussing salary until the employer is somewhat committed to employing you. Is it a good idea to mention that due to the distance you would like to discuss these things on the phone? 

The question is vague, as you have realised. Instead of worrying about the exact meaning, consider what the purpose of asking it is. They want to filter out candidates with little experience or understanding, so ask yourself: 

The company has a legal responsibility to accommodate your physical needs, under EU employment rules that will have been transposed into your country's own laws. If the chairs they provide are causing you physical pain and there is an easy solution that doesn't greatly impact your work or cost much, they are required to offer it to you. Have you made it clear to the health and safety officer that you are extremely uncomfortable? If so, and if you believe you can reasonably do your job with a different type of chair, your next step would be HR. 

It is said there are lies, damned lies, and statistics. Most of us have probably heard this clich√©, but I cite it because I think it's important to the conversation. If one got extremely meta, then probably everyone has lied during an interview. If one were asked during an interview, "Why do you want to leave your current position?", the full and completely honest answer might cover five points and take six to eight minutes to answer. Three of the points are considered positive, one is considered neutral, and one is considered negative. You start talking about positive point number one, segue into positive point two, then stop talking. If they press for more info, you raise positive point three. You stop talking, and the interviewer is happy. Because you failed to raise the neutral and the negative point, did you lie? In my view, no. You answered the question to the interviewer's satisfaction, which is what most people want. Most people, sitting on either side of an interview, do not hold Fifth Level Black Belts in Grammarian Jiu Jitsu. Also, most people don't want to hear someone drone on for six to eight minutes answering a question. Now, let's say the interviewer pressed you with a follow up question of, "Thank you for your answer. It's been my experience that no one leaves a job, of their own accord, unless there are some negative aspects to that job. Please talk about the negative reasons why you want to leave your current position." I have at times been asked more probing questions such as, "I feel like there may be other reasons why you're wanting to leave your current position." Coworkers over the years have also had these experiences. At that point, they are asking to hear the neutral and negative reasons, so if you don't share those then you are lying. You said something that caught my attention. You said, "I think he is a level below the required knowledge". There are many adjectives in the English language for levels of expertise. In purely alphabetic order, some of these include: Advanced, Beginner, Experienced, Expert, Intermediate, Newbie, Novice, Proficient, Rookie, Seasoned, Senior, Skilled, Skillful, Talented If a person called herself an Expert, but your definition of Expert is different from hers, then the two of you have a different definition of Expert. However, I would not say that the person lied. If a person said they had five years of experience in a particular technology, but in adding up the months and years they worked with the particular technology, it was really only four years and ten months, did they lie? Technically yes, but how far from the truth were they when they were estimating in their head and concluded they had five years of experience? Conversely, if it was really one year and ten months, then their estimation skills might not be to blame and they were in fact lying. You have to analyze and assess each individual situation and determine what was the real harm or foul. I do not believe it's as simple as you caught them in a lie so terminate them. 

What you really want to know is if family friendly policies will result in undue burden on yourself. Assuming you don't have some strange notion of "fairness" in not wanting parents to look after their children properly, your real concern is the effect on you. You can ask companies directly about this. Simply state that in the past you have been overloaded or distracted by these policies, and would like to know how this company deals with them. Seeking out companies that don't have a family friendly policy could easily backfire - if they don't give parents basic support, what other kinds of poor working conditions do they have? Do they account for every minute of your day, are the inflexible when you need unexpected extra time off for some reason (e.g. sick relatives, funerals etc)? 

Can I honestly claim 5 years? Sounds like you can since you have been using it since 2012. Do you have the skills to do this job? You will need to convince the interviewer. 

Unfortunately it can be difficult to determine before hand what the company's reaction will be, and especially in larger companies it can depend which department you are in. One useful technique is to look for or ask for copies of their policy on disabilities and medical conditions. If they don't have a policy that's probably a bad sign. Beyond that it's best to wait until they have shown interest in you. Depending on the severity of your condition you might be able to do interviews and progress quite far before it becomes an issue. Once they are seriously considering you as a potential employee it is easier to simply tell them about your condition, explain what support or adaptations you will need, and ask if they feel that is okay. It does potentially waste some of your time, but telling them up front before they actually know you and understand that it's not something scary or debilitating might get you nowhere. And of course, you have to be willing to walk away if it doesn't seem right. 

In short, no, you should not remove an account number or refuse pay. You must be doing something right, because if you were really doing a bad job, you would be fired. It is understandable to feel like you aren't doing any good work or you are burned out, but the ultimate decision on how you are performing comes down to the company. If you really need some form of validation, go ask your boss/colleagues/ceo of the startup for a quick status meeting and ask if your work lately is up to snuff and satisfying all requirements. If they say yes, then you should feel good. If you still feel bad, maybe that is indicative of something deeper and aligned with you not feeling challenged or engaged at work. 

Do not say anything negative or overtly damaging. That kind of sensitive feedback should come directly from Joe's manager. You can get into a real murky area if you say things that damage his reputation and cause loss of job and he finds out. Don't rehash previous bad projects, failed deployments, or anything like that. One thing that I have found works is to say lukewarm things about the person that are mostly irrelevant to what the primary work they will be doing. What you don't say about a person in a referral is equally as impactful. If I was asked to give a reference for a dev who I thought had poor skills, I would say something along the lines of: 

I wouldn't bring up any specific reason of why you want more money unless it relates to your ability to do the job in question. It is irrelevant. As Joe points out, you are not going to tie your salary to the cost of the rent/housing in the area. If it goes down, you are not going to voluntarily give up your salary increase. And I'm sure there are cheaper places in the area that you could get that would not warrant you needing a higher salary. It does not matter why you want a higher salary during initial negotiations and the company is not going to see a specific reason to want more as better than another reason (unless it is related to your capacity to do the job better). It could be for a nicer apartment, you are planning on having a kid in a year, you have an expensive drug habit, it really doesn't matter. Just ask for it and say it is not feasible for you to take the job if it is lower than that amount.
