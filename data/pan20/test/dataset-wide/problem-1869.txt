and then some prescribed link to our website, social media, etc. This way you never have to think about your closing, which makes emailing a lot easier I think. 

It's a very culturally dependent thing, I guess. I'm from the Netherlands and we are not the most formal people in the world. Our neighbours in Germany are very attached to the proper use of Du/Sie and also their titles (like Dr.). In Holland, not so much. You start out usually with the 'polite' form, but a lot of times, people actually say: please, use the 'you'-form. I actually agree with you, I think how you address someone doesn't necessarily relate to how professionally you treat them or how they will treat you. It's perfectly possible to drop the T-V distinction and still maintain a professional working relationship/distance. But, I do believe that this only works if people think about this the same way as you do. There are some more old-fashioned people who do not like to be you-ed and they might feel uncomfortable. If I know this is the case, I won't force it :) 

It's no problem to make your own business card. There are plenty of companies that don't even issue business cards for their full-time permanent employees. You need a way to give your contact information to people you meet at these seminars and events, and the business card is the easiest way to do so. I think it'd be a good idea to put your employer's name and your title on the business card, that way people know you're employed and that information could help them to remember who you were when they look at your card. You can also include your company's phone number and your work email address, but since you say you're a temporary employee, it'd be a better idea to include your personal phone number and email address. That way people can still contact you after you leave your current employer. EDIT: Your manager doesn't have a problem with you attending those events that he forwards to you (otherwise he wouldn't forward them to you), and it wouldn't hurt to ask him if the company can make some business cards for you since you would like to attend those events. Also you can have two sets of cards if you prefer (one business and one personal), but only give one of those cards to anyone you meet, otherwise they might be confused about how they should contact you. 

I can imagine it is frustrating you. I had the same thing, but in my case this co-worker was much more senior than me. "It's okay, but if you just... " - and then he changed almost everything, and not even making it better, just different. While I really respected his authority and knowledge, I sometimes wondered why I was actually working on his project, when in the end almost everything was his work. It took me a while, but then I actually felt confident enough to ask him about the changes. Why my way wasn't the right way. I figured maybe I could learn from his ideas. Most of the time, he just wanted it to look more like his style (I'm in software development). I made it clear to him that I don't want everything changed just because we have a different style of coding. Sometimes he had a good point about the way I solved issues and I actually learned a lot from him. And we're still friendly, although we both have a different job now. So, my answer, I would evaluate which of these problems are better off with his approach and which ones are just as good, but different when he re-does your work. You can be a little protective of your work. You don't have to fight over this at all, it's not even a discussion. Just get your points across. Some changes you are okay with, some you aren't. Explain to him why you don't think his solution is really adding anything. If he is the sole person responsible for the project, take extra care to make sure he 'understands' that your solution is just as good. It might be a hassle in the beginning but hopefully he will get that his way isn't the only way of getting things done. 

As a full time employee, I've met people. I meet people I work with, vendors, clients, and I run into people through colleagues at work who are in need of people with my skills. Some employees have left companies I've worked with to begin new adventures, and because they've worked with me, they've sometimes approached me for consulting/contracting gigs, and as long as I know the work is serious, will get paid for it, and that my employer wouldn't have a problem with it, I'll likely take on the work. I've no plans to move into consulting full time, as I enjoy the perks of a stable career, but if you want to move into consulting, you should already have a potential client base or referral network. If you don't, then you'll first need to build one up. Here are some ways you can do this: 

If I make a mistake, I don't deny it and if it is very severe, I would apologise, but try and keep it professional. Everyone makes a mistake sometimes, it's only human, but you're right you shouldn't blame it on someone else if it is your mistake. Something along the lines of: 

I find it usually best to own up to your mistakes, both to your team in the daily standup meeting and to your manager. The performance review has a little bit of a bad timing now, but if this is the first time you made a mistake like this, I don't think it will be a huge problem. I would do my best though (and communicate) to make up for lost work asap since it is your fault and make a habit of saving to SVN regularly 

You made a correct statement. As an interviewee, you have no idea who the other candidates are and therefore you couldn't possibly know if you are the best person for the job. I think the interviewer was taken aback because he had probably never heard a candidate start off their answer to that particular question like that. There is probably a lot of people out there who try to inflate their skills and abilities during interviews. The honesty and modesty that you exhibited is not the norm, especially for a question like that where you have to sell yourself. Since you got the job, your preface obviously didn't hurt. I think it could have been a positive - the interviewer may have appreciated your honesty. It's not always easy for interviewers to tell if a candidate is being honest. 

On your last day, your boss and colleagues should have everything they need from you so that there won't be any loose ends. 

As someone who is developing a product targeting businesses who want to succeed with a remote workforce, I can tell you that once some of your staff are working remotely, it's not a huge leap to transition other employees to the work at home model as well. If you were the first employee at the company to ever transition to a remote position, then this would create some problems and challenges that your employer would need to solve, such as how to communicate with you, how to measure your productivity, and how to create a culture that's inclusive of remote workers. The latter would involve a transitionary period where in-house employees must get used to going out of their way to include the remote worker, you, in their meetings, communications, and decision-making. This could be costly, both in time and in terms of productivity. In this case, I'd not suggest misleading your employer, unless you're not prepared to go months without an income. But in your case, moving to a remote position is as simple as having an Internet connection, a job that you can do remotely, and access to all of the tools you would need to communicate with remote workers. Since you already work with remote employees, you already have many of these tools, as well as some knowledge you've obtained via osmosis simply by working with and being exposed to other remote workers. Your managers and co-workers also know what to expect in terms of how to communicate effectively with you. So in your case, just plan as if you're going to stay with the company. If things go well with the new prospective employment and you have to put in your two weeks notice, then do so. Treat this just as you would any other termination of employment notice by being respectful and thankful, helping your employer transition your current role to a replacement, returning any company equipment that doesn't belong to you, and leaving on good terms. 

Depends very much on the company, I would say. And by that I mean if it is bad you stumbled upon pornographic material when using google to find a solution. I would just mention it casually to my colleague / supervisor but would not make a big deal out of it. But this is very depending on the company culture and probably also the country / culture. I'm in Europe (Netherlands) As for googling to find help on problems encountered while programming, I don't know a single developer that doesn't do this. I think we all do. I used to program in Python, and now I'm programming in ABL (Progress) and it is much harder to find anything about that on the net. I don't like it :D 

If you've been with the company for 5 years, there's a very good chance that they've completely forgotten what your educational background was. They know you're loyal, a good worker, and get things done. They know you provide value to the company. Therefore, once you get your degree and find another job, just say you're looking at other opportunities to expand and grow your career, and that you've found a job with X company. Give them the notice period, but don't mention the degree unless they ask. If I apply for a new job at another company, I don't have to tell my soon-to-be former employer that the time I spent working on an open source project during my off time improved my skills enough to land the new job. The fact is that people move on all the time, and depending on how valuable you are to the company, they may counter-offer and they may not. Saying you've been working for 4 years to get a degree without telling them might be kind of offensive, especially if you were friends with anyone there. As a side note, if they counter-offer or express interest in keeping you on, it then might be advantageous to mention the new degree. It will put things in perspective for your employer and help them understand that you're no longer a little fish, so to speak. Other than that, telling them you have a degree shouldn't matter in their decision to keep you on or not. You're already working for them, and a piece of paper doesn't change how valuable you are to them, only how marketable you are to other employers. 

Next time you walk by his desk and he's not there, look at the phone on his desk. If it has an LCD display on it, it might show his name. If not, it will probably show his phone number. Memorize the last 4 or however many digits you need to make an intraoffice call. When you know he's not at his desk, call his number and wait for his voicemail. (You'll probably want to make the call from a conference room phone so that his phone doesn't tell him he has a missed call from you.) Hopefully he will have customized his voicemail greeting to say his name. 

I don't know for how many staff you present your ideas, but is it possible to talk to (a few of) them individually (like casually when on coffee break or something) and find out what they would find interesting or useful? Maybe if you involve them, they get a little more enthusiastic before you present your ideas and you won't be met with only blank stares
