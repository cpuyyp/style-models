I am seeing this behavior and I find it interesting. After I close a Virtual Machine on VMWare-Workstation, even closing the VMWware-Workstation console I see lots of hard disk activiy on of the virtual machine. I have seen this in the VMDK and in the VMEM files as you can see here. 

You may create a batch file who save the time of the PC uptime when in it is run. The content of the *.bat file could be something like this: 

We are planning to sign with DKIM emails for multiple domains. Each domain will have a CNAME to a DNS entry in a common domain where the keys are stored. If every domain sign with the same key, but off course using different domain and selector, all of them will created independent reputation? If one domain is marked as spammer will affect the deliverability of the other domains? They are completely different and uses a differnt selector. Just shared the key. 

You have another issue in your code that maybe you haven't seen. Due the way you define the variable it wont be change when the DNS name isn't correct. Check it an define it using another technique. 

Your PC always consumed that RAM, but older versions of Windows didn't show. Now if you think that the hardware reserverd memory is a lot we need to which device is consuming that and how much each device. For do that open the Device Manager (), go to the view menu, Select Resources By Connection and expand the Memory subtree. There you have the ranges of RAM used by each device. Convert the two values of each device from hexadeximal to decimal, and substrac them. The difference is how much memory is a device using. This way we will know what are taking you RAM. 

This is the issue: All programs works fine in the network. A Command line console, elevated with UAC, can make a ping and everything works fine. A command line, runnning as standar user, says General Failure when you make ping. We try: 

But if the RDP is a valid file when windows asks the credentials it fails and continue with next process. For demo purposes I changed the logoff for a calc. 

If you check that the DNS and Netbios are working well, another option that happend to me sometime was a wrong entry in the Credential Manager. If there is a bad credential save you will can access using the FQDNS but not if you write only the name, not matter if your dns suffix is ok. Try deleting all entries of your credential manager, this very probably will fix your issue. 

I don't know the answer about Deep Freeze but this is the kind of problems that this type of software generates. The software freeze the machine in a point of the time, and everything you do is lost when the machine is restart. That is bad thing because machines stops to taking changes of important things like updates. These type of software let you make execptions to dont have this issues, but in lots of cases still fails. Some time ago Microsoft had a software like this called Steady State for Windows Xp but for Windows 7 it was disccontinuated. Â¿Why? Because this kind of software is not necessary. With Windows natively you can have mandatory profiles, a type of user profile that lost all the changes when the user close his session. So my recommendation here is dont use Deep Freeze, Windows natively can do to a similar behavior with lots of advantages for free. Microsoft has a guide to do this using GPos and mandatory profiles: Creating a Steady State by Using Microsoft Technologies 

Remote Desktop Connection (RDP). You can connect to a machine using the TCP 3389, view the desktop and do whatever you like. Microsoft Management Console (MMC). Almost everything in a Windows system can be manage through the MMC. You can open it using the command and in the menu File select Add or remove Snapin. The snap-in are DLLS created by the sofware manufacturers to manage their products. Windows comes with lots of them, for manage Disks, Users, Services, in a domain controller the Users and Groups, in a CA the certificates. When you add a snap-in you select if you want to manage the local system or a remote system. This requieres the 135 TCP port. You can save a console and the file extension is . Windows comes with lots of presaved consoles like , , , all of them save on . Remote command prompt. You can run a remote command prompt like you do with SSH using Telnet. This is not installed by default on Windows but you can install the client and the server using the server manager. This requieres the por 23. As you know Telnet is insecure and not reccomend because everythin is in plaintext. You have a really good alternative from Microsoft called PSExec that let you runs commands or open a remote command prompt without prior installation of anything and in a safe manner. Powershell Powershell is the new command line of Microsoft. It has a lot of advantages over the traditional command line. It was dessinged to work with Objects insted of plain text and you can do really powerfull things, this is the approach of Microsoft to compete with the famous terminal on the unix systems. You really should learn about it. Well, a lot of Powershell commands (Cmdlets) let you work in remote Systems. 

But the logoff happens instantaly, it doesnt wait for exit. I also try this using C# and Process.WaitforExit(). What should you do? I think is a issue with mstsc.exe when the parameter is a RDP file. Update: I was testing and this works well in Windows 7, but in Windows 8 and in Windows 7 Thin PC it doesnt work. Update Using powershell I advance a little. I my bat looks like this, launchin the process in Powershell it works. 

If you will use this machines only to virtualization you should use a core edition, this is because it has a smaller footpring and cosumes less hardware resources in the parent partition. You can manage them from a client PC using Hyper-V remote magamente console. If you have only Windows Server 2008 R2 Standard maybe is not a good idea to use them in ths scenario. There is a Windows Server 2008 Core Edition enable only to run Hyper-V, is Call Hyper-V Server and is completly free, included support. If you have Windows Server 2008 R2 enterprise edition is better because you can make a cluster between both host machines.
