In your case it is wrong. Why? Because you would not escape from suffering. You would be reborn again as a human on Earth, but this Earth would not be the same as this one. There would be many wars, diseases, famine, anger, violence. You would be without shelter, thirsty and hungry. You would be in immense fear. You would cry and be in physical pain. Then a disease would strike you and you would die. This would happen over and over again. You would hear not even a word about the Dhamma. Meditation would be unknown to you for a very very long time. After many rebirths in a world permeated with suffering, you would once again be reborn in this same world, same body, same problems, same everyhing ... once again you would need to face the same problems you're facing now. This time, you would not kill yourself. Instead, you would suffer until a disease would kill you. Then you would be reborn and die again and again and again, faced with the same problems you're facing right now, until you would finally solve the same problems you're facing RIGHT NOW. So what will you do? Will you take a shorter route or a longer route? It's your decision. 

I haven't read about Nagarjuna's claims nor I have read or heard anywhere about such claims, but I know Nagarjuna is speaking the truth. What is the truth? An effect always arises independently of the cause. A cause always arises independently of the effect which produced the cause. All causes and effects arise completely independently. There are no causes, nor effects. Everything arises and ceases independently. Thus, everything being independent: 

No, not in this realm. You have such and such kamma which does not allow you to change your understanding, or coarse intention, of stealing into not stealing. Knowing you're a human, and based on the questions you're asking and the discussion I'm having with you, I know that you, including all other humans, due to their kamma, cannot change their understanding, or coarse intention, of stealing into not stealing. Any human being who claims "I changed my understanding, or coarse intention, of stealing into not stealing" is lying. If this same human being then really starts to steal from others, it just enforces his lie. Thus I understand, thus I know ... Such a human being, who is lying in the way described, is deluded and ignorant. His ignorance is stemming out of greed and/or selfishness. And where does this selfishness and greed come from in such a person? They come from the idea "I am" or the idea "I exist". Both are not truths, illusions, not the real nature of things, coming from ignorance. Knowing this and knowing that this human being is lying, I know that this being clings on the idea "I am" or the idea "I exist". Knowing then, that this human being is stealing, I know that this being clings on the idea "I am" or "I exist" very much. The clinging on this very same idea and the actions of stealing, feeding the clinging on that very same idea, is what will propel this human into the lower realms of existence. Thus, out of compassion for all beings, I tell them not to steal as it does not lead to the cessation of suffering. There is a way to the cessation of suffering and that is not to steal. To summarize: Every being draws his own line with stealing. Where will a being draw his line will be defined by his kamma at the time he draws the line. This is the truth. 2nd EDIT: 

These are the medicines. Other than that, there are no others. If there are others, they all stem out of one of these three. If anatta cannot be realized, self will use either medicine 1. or 2. The bigger the suffering of the self, the more it will use these two medicines. Now, some selfs have unpleasant feelings of inadequacy or lack of importance or similar. To get rid of such unpleasant feelings, they can take medicine 1. Thus, they start desiring to have feelings of adequacy or similar. Since they can't get these pleasant feelings by mere wishing or fantasizing, they decide to become experts in some field, for example, in the Dhamma and they start teaching the Dhamma and guiding others in the Dhamma. By teaching the Dhamma, gaining followers and guiding them, they get the pleasant feelings of adequacy and the unpleasant feelings of inadequacy cease. These pleasant feelings of adequacy can be any feelings, like feelings of being proud of oneself, or having pride, or being important, or feelings of entitlement, or feelings of being superior, or smart, or wise, etc. But since all feelings are impermanent, the pleasant feelings of adequacy sooner or later cease. Once they cease, the inadequate self is revealed, and unpleasant feelings of inadequacy arise again. Again, the desire for feelings of adequacy arise, and the cycle repeats. When one truly realizes anatta, there is no way a person will use medicine 1 or medicine 2 to alleviate unpleasant feelings. Instead, wisdom will be used, which comes from own personal experience and insight, which goes like this: From craving as a condition, comes becoming. From becoming, come unpleasant feelings. With the removal of craving unpleasant feelings cease. That's why a wise has no unpleasant feelings or, to be more precise, a wise has unpleasant feelings when he allows them to arise. For example, he could see pain, but he would not be in pain until pain is allowed to arise. Or he could see fear, but he would not be in fear until fear is allowed to arise. He has mastered feelings to perfection. He knows what is feeling, what is its cause and what is the way to its cessation. Knowing thus, the wise helps, when he is capable of helping and the person needs help and the person wants to be helped. Knowing thus, the wise also doesn't forget to help himself, as only by helping himself, he would be able to help others. 

The subtle line is defined by kamma/ignorance. (An equivalent to the previous statement for not yet liberated beings is: The subtle line is defined by knowledge.) Knowing that the subtle line of stealing (or any other action) is defined by kamma/ignorance/knowledge, how can you know when an action is virtuous and when it is not? By knowing the kamma/ignorance of beings. (An equivalent to the previous statement for not yet liberated beings is: By knowing the knowledge of beings.) Thus, The One, who knows the kamma/ignorance/knowledge of beings, proclaims thus the following: Taking what is not yours is not virtuous. It does not lead to the end of suffering. It creates suffering. It is not the right path towards the end of suffering. Thus, do not take what is not yours nor aspire others to take what is not theirs. The aspirant who is following the dhamma, searching for an end to suffering, should refrain from such wrong doings. EDIT: 

There is no soul. There are only fabrications due to ignorance. When life ends, fabrications continue to arise due to ignorance. What is fabricated has no connection with previous life. It is entirely new. As long as fabrications are present, the "body" (5 skandhas) is present. The "body" which is present is destined to suffering and death. Suffering and death continue until ignorance is ended. Thus, there is no soul nor any incorporeal entities nor body. There is just this cycle of arising and ceasing of "body" (5 skandhas) which is subject to suffering. 

Because there isn't anyone to be born. Since there isn't anyone to be born, nobody can become involved with this "ever-changing processes of concocting, of compounding". If there really would be someone involved with this "ever-changing processes of concocting, of compounding", when that person would be created, the "ever-changing processes of concocting, of compounding" would start after that person's creation. Since that person would become involved in the "ever-changing processes of concocting, of compounding", with the creation of that person, the "ever-changing processes of concocting, of compounding" would start. But since there isn't anyone to be created nor there is anyone involved in these "ever-changing processes of concocting, of compounding", this process can't just magically restart after the complete annihilation of the physical body. Just think about it: if there isn't anyone involved in this process, then how can this process restart?? Nobody is involved in it, so why did it start?? Who/what started it? If there isn't anyone involved in it, then neither the physical body is involved in it nor anything in the entire universe at all is involved in it! If neither the physicall body is involved in it nor anything in the entire universe at all, that would mean, that if the physicall body and everything in the universe is annihilated and then recreated, this process wouldn't restart!! This "total annihilation and recreation" would not affect this process a single bit!
