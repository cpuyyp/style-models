The goal of gathering information is to gain knowledge. The aim of statistics is to measure the level of certainty in the knowledge we gain from information. That level of certainty is proportional to the number of observed events. Fewer events, less certainty. One event, very little certainty. You also have to consider how closely each anecdote agrees with the others. In general, the variation in anecdotes is large due to the differences in the setup and also in the results. One of the biggest problems with anecdotes is that they are uncontrolled and you really don't know all the inputs and the number of inputs that could affect the result is often huge. Without more information it is usually difficult to turn this information into useful knowledge. Take for example that someone eats a certain plant and is cured of a certain disease. Then another person also eats that plant and gets cured of that same disease. If that is all you know then that is close to useless because those people also ate many other things and did may other things which could all cause an effect, individually or in concert. I'll also reiterate the point about Bayesian statistics. It is essential that you consider prior knowledge in any statistics. If something is thought to be likely you need less proof to "prove" it. Likewise, "extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence". The failure to do this well is endemic in the social and medical sciences largely because there are so many input factors and it is so hard to control studies (think about controlling a study about murder - you can't ethically create this study, so you have to observe the uncontrolled world). But this applies to all anecdotal evidence as well. 

The reason I ask is because of the ambiguity of some statements when the conditionals of a condition are not referenced by tense i.e time. For example, in the Cognito Ergo Sum 'I think therefore I am', it could be read as saying that thinking causing existence, which is obviously not the case. Let my elucidate the problem, as you'll be well aware, this is an instance of Modus Ponens, which can broken down as such: 

The reason why I find this question to be worthy here is because a Google search simply does not return any valid resources. Most results are from, shall we say, less scientific sources, yet simultaneously The Law of Cause and Effect is a central principle in the world of the sciences. I Imagine there are various sub-laws expatiating upon the relationship between Cause and Effect, various axioms for and/or derived by the law, and entailments of the law. What I want is something imitating Aristotle's 3 Laws Of Existence. Existence is an 'obvious' principle central to science, as we, afterall, don't go about studying the non-existent, so we may sometimes take this for grated. However, even this 'obvious' principle has certain properties that have been delineated by Aristotle. I was wondering if anything has been similarly documented for the Law Of Cause And Effect. 

I would like to get a better understanding of the juxtaposition of wealth and poverty. By wealth I mean the situation where one has resources as opposed to one that does not. Consider the following situations: A1. A man sits at a table filled with food A2. A man sits at a table filled with food while next to him is a human starving next to him. The human next to him is weak and on crutches (to signify how poverty can be limiting in range and mobility) B1. A man sitting in the park has a bucket of water B2. A man sitting in the park has a bucket of water while there is a human next to him who is on fire C1. There is a group with access to large amounts of water and food C2. There is a group with access to large amounts of water and food while there is a human on fire and a human starving next to them I would gather that if you asked people if the situation listed in the first list item was in any way right or wrong then they would say there is nothing wrong with a person eating or drinking. But if you asked people about the second list item they would say that is something wrong. 

This is usually thought of as p being a sufficient cause, which necessitates an effect, in the case of the Cogito Ergo Sum, this would mean thinking causes existence. However, it could also mean that p is sufficient evidence of a necessary cause, in the case of the Cogito Ergo Sum, this would mean that thinking is sufficient evidence for the necessity of one's existence, which of course is Descartes intent in his assertion. So it's not that a given cause (thinking) is sufficient for the necessary outcome for one's existence (the effect), but that thinking (the outcome) is a sufficient effect which can be adduced to a necessary cause â€“ existence. It's not just grand assertions like the Cogito Ergo Sum, however, that is prone to such ambiguity. Afterall, one may consider that given such a fundamental assertion, it may not be the best example. Consider then the assertion: 'if there is rain, then there are clouds'. Certainly one has never seen the pour of rain from a cloudless sky, so we can say this is true with great confidence. However, if a blind man was told that 'if it is raining, then there are clouds' (and was never taught the cause-effect relationship of clouds and rain) he would be as justified to presume (though wrong) in saying that rain causes clouds. 

If you watch Dr Who you will know somewhat what I'm talking about but I've seen same question in other stories, Naruto, for example etc. My real question is based in politics. Let's say the process, as it is, of becoming a politician or it could be any position, results in someone being corrupted or turning evil, but a strange thing happens in one person where in the end that person makes the right choices, how do you describe that person's character? I'm not talking about anything recent, but something recent reminded me of this question that I've had for a while I'm sure everyone has had this question. If I become "this" [insert position] will it corrupt me? If I do [insert thing] will it change me? Etc Note: I say "evil" but maybe it's corruption. 

I finished an interesting book today about some characters and a discussion ensued. I won't name the book but the scenario has been seen before. There is a character, supposed evil villain, let's say his name is Bobo. We don't know his past. The group of protagonists have an argument. One called Bobo evil and says it's the inside that counts. Another person said it's not our words or thoughts in the end but our actions that determine our character. Not sure how to word this so question is: 

The reason why I ask is because the law of cause and effect is central to scienctific investigation, yet I've only heard that causes necessitate effects and all effects have a cause. But it seems to me that this could go deeper, much deeper. Like what if you have two effects of the same cause or two causes of the same effect, how would you know? How do you know that you have a cause-effect relationship, and how do you know if something merely seems to be a cause-effect relationship, but is not? I've tried searching for this on Google, but the results returned are sketchy at best, as they subscribe to what one may call pseudo-science (for e.g, every 'good cause' brings about a 'good effect', or something else to do with karma, which I personally commit to the flames). Thank you in advance. 

Before I begin, what I mean by 'systems' is what I've dubbed 'axiomatic systems', those which act as the starting point for all knowledge, for which I know of three: Maths, Logic, and Set Theory. I'll just call them systems from now on, though. I'll first begin with my intuitions behind this question. Most of you here will be familiar with logic, being that it's the 'tools of Philosophy'. Whenever you do logic, you're working within a system. One can't just 'do' logic, for logic is the activity within the structure of a system. So the reason you can't just do logic is for the same reason you can't drive without a car. So, such systems have to be literally designed; its axioms must be discovered, it's properties must be studied, its values and operations must be declared before use, etc. I've been looking for this answer for quite a while, and in searching the depths of the internet the best I can find are papers that partially (and very briefly) study some of the aspects of the analysis and creation of systems. What I really want, however, is an academic, and rigorous field of study that gives an exhaustive account of how such systems are created. I think the reason why am having trouble is because am using 'systems' in a very technical way, and I have no other way to really express what I mean other than "systems". Quick note: There are fields out there looking at the use of systems (maths, logic, set theory), how they can be combined, how there used in computer programming, but none which seems to study the actual systems themselves. Oh, by the way, am not sure what to tag this as, so sorry if I've missused the tags I have provided. 

There are three reasons for the capital punishment: punishment, deterrence, and removal from society. Punishment is questionable. Is it worse to be in prison for 60 years or to die quickly? Is this a martyr case where the offender will actually see death as a reward? For most people, it is a punishment, but it's case-by-case and definitely not certain. Deterrence is commonly cited throughout history and even today. The argument is that loss of life is highly motivating. Without experiencing it, many would think that loss of life is worse than life in prison (maybe those that have experience prison would not agree). If you are in prison, there is always a chance you might be let out, so there is hope in that. Even in a life term case, most societies have pathways for release (executive pardon, for example). Removal from society is really unique for capital punishment. Life in prison requires that the victimized society pay to sustain the murderer, certain people still have to interact with that person, and there is a possibility for release or escape. If he gets out, he may re-offend. If you look at modern society, the cost of keeping someone in prison for 60 years is small relative to all the other things we spend money on, so it doesn't seem like a big negative. However, this question is not relative to a particular culture, so you could imagine a small village that would be greatly burdened by providing room and board to a non-working person. From the perspective of the other people, they want him permanently removed from them and their options are kill him or keep him around, pay for him, and interact with him. So, there's the ethical complication of the survivor's mental and emotional health (which could go either way). Note that there are practical issues to consider outside of the question such as wrongful convictions (OP assumed guilt) and lengthy appeals process that may actually cost more than indefinite incarceration (in some times and places). 

Is there a name for this situation? Is it negligence, indifference? What if, deity forbid, in the second list item the human was an infant? And is there laws around this? Would anything change if the individuals that have resources have access to a vast abundance of resources? 

FYI I've list four interrelated questions but answers to any of them would prove helpful. EDIT: I wrote "what is the ethic response" but I meant to write "what is the ethical / unethical" response. Once I know this I want to know basically, if there is a discussion around if it is wrong to let someone die who you have the power to help. I know there are some legally obligations to help or not help (good samaritan law) but I still don't know the names or concepts that already exist around this scenario. Or the argument I was only doing my job the Nazis used during WWII. So far the argument is legal right and wrong but specieial (species related) right or wrong. 

For example, "You are rich because you are blessed (God blessed you with riches). If you are not rich then you must not be blessed (God chose not to bless you oh ye of little faith)." Second example, "By the super secret law of attraction you can manifest riches in your life. If you don't have riches it is because you did not attract it into your life you stupid idiot. It's so easy. Do you hate money?" Does this make sense? 

Holes (as the word is commonly understood) are almost always filled with something else, so a filled hole can, in at least some cases, still be considered a hole. The most obvious example is a hole dug in the ground. It is filled to the brim with air (which are particles with mass just the same as filling it with sand would be). In many cases, it is also filled with electromagnetic waves of all sorts (light, magnetic field of the earth, UV light, infrared, microwaves, radio waves, etc.) Common knowledge and understanding that not all matter and energy that fills volume can be seen should suffice for documentation. 

The CPT Symmetry theory in quantum mechanics might answer your question. It states that if you flip the charge of every particle (C), invert the parity (P) of the universe (reflect the physical coordinates of space (x,y,z) becomes (-x,-y,-z)), and reverse time (T), then the new universe would be indistinguishable from the current universe. 

I'll take an out-of-the-box view of this question to hopefully provide an interesting perspective to the question. There is actually a great example of this in modern life here on Earth in the theory of a multiverse (as opposed to a single universe). The question, "How did the universe begin?" has been one justification of a divine being for all of recorded history. It didn't start itself, and everything has a beginning, so there must be someone outside of the universe (God) who started it in motion. Modern physics cannot disprove this theory. Even the Big Bang has the question "what caused it?" "God did it" is an untestable explanation that is enough to confirm belief for many people. However, this is a problem for people who do not believe in a divine being. People have thought up a wide range of ideas to this solution, but few hold up under investigation. Enter the multiverse. The multiverse is a relatively recent astrophysics theory that states that there are an infinite number of universes in every possible state (only some are capable of sustaining life and each can have different laws of physics). Each spontaneously pops into existence by creating equal amounts of matter and anti-matter and energy and anti-energy. Each universe is totally separate from the others, so no one in one can observe the others. The multiverse theory (and the existence of universes that cannot support life and are not observed - only believed in) allows some people to see meaning in existence by providing an alternate hypothesis to the existence of a divine being. So in this case, a universe as described above does have "meaning." 

About the question So, by 'type of questions', I really mean this from an ontological perspective. I imagine there is a complete set of (type of) questions, and thus any question that ever was or will be asked will be of one type or the other belonging to such a set. A problem In trying to form such a set containing all question types, is there a way we could know for sure that we have covered all possibilities? Say we never had a concept of time, we could thus never ask 'when' something happened. Furthermore, if this was the case, it's not like we could just conclude 'oh, we must be missing the concept of time!', because obviously we would have started with such a concept to make that conclusion to begin with. My attempt at an answer In trying to derive an answer myself, I have come up with 6 types. These are: when and where (relating to spacetime), what and who (identification and personhood i.e human identification), why (motive) and how (causality). A problem with the answer It seems as if though however, that many questions can be rephrased to give the same meaning, but using different question types. For e.g, 'how does a ball drop to the earth' vs 'why does a ball drop to the earth'. The answer to both seems to be gravity. So there seems to be a problem of interchangeability. Now I know that why and how aren't always interchangeable, such as 'how did he murder' vs 'why did he murder', but when they are, that seems to be problematic. Summary So, how can we go about forming the set of all question types, and can we know when we have done so? Furthermore, why is it that some question types seem interchangeable when such types are of a different nature to each other? Maybe it's just a matter linguistic confusion?
