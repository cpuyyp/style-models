Comfort isn't really an issue for a 30-minute ride, as long as the bike fits. Also, for any given price point, an aluminium bike will have better components than a carbon bike, so will probably be more enjoyable to ride. For a commuter bike, I'd be much more worried about theft and damage, unless you have somewhere secure to park the bike at work. If you are worried that aluminium will be too harsh, you're probably wrong but I'd consider steel instead, rather than carbon. Or just put wider tyres on it. I've ridden rigid aluminium hybrids with 28mm tyres and had no comfort issues at all. Any good bike shop should be happy to let you take a test ride of at least half an hour on any bike you're thinking of buying. 

A gear ratio is a gear ratio. It doesn’t matter if the gears are connected by a chain, a belt, meshing with one another or anything else. All that matters is the ratio of the number of teeth. 

If they did really appear over night you may want to consult your doctor as it may be a symptom of something more serious.But if you mean it occurred over a week or two you might try changing gloves.If you got lubricant on your hands and in the gloves it may be an allergic reaction that happens every time you put them on.There is also the possibility that you have developed an allergy to the glove itself. 

Many upgrade components will perform better than their lower cost counterpart, many are just lighter. Sometimes the weight savings comes at the cost of reliability. I would try to test ride some more bikes with higher end components even if you have to beg borrow or plead. While on the ride try to notice if the shifts seem smoother, the saddle fit better, the brakes seem steadier, the handling crisper less twitchy. If you don't feel the difference between your 105 and Ultegra don't spend the money on that upgrade. If your butt feels like you went to heaven then upgrade the saddle. The best way to get the most for your money is to upgrade as items need replacement. If it is broken or worn out the extra cost of better components 25 to 50 percent more than the original. 

This depends very much on the situation, and on local law. For example, suppose the road isn't wide enough that a car can safely pass a bike. In this case, it may be better to ride two-abreast because that makes it impossible for cars to pass, whereas riding in single file might result in some cars trying to make unsafe passing manoeuvres. Conversely, if the road is wide enough to allow cars to safely overtake a single bicycle but not two bikes side by side, it's likely to be safer – and more polite! – to ride in single file. 

The gear ratio is simply the ratio of the number of teeth on the two cogs. If you can see the gears, you can compute it by counting the teeth and dividing. If you can't see the gears (e.g., an IGH), just measure how many times the rear wheel turns for one turn of the pedals (or, for more accuracy, do ten turns of the pedals and divide the answer by ten). Time trials would be a terrible way to compute the gear ratio since there are so many uncontrolled variables and confounding factors. For example, a higher gear ratio would potentially give you a higher top speed but it would take you longer to get there. It's not clear to me why you think that computing the gear ratio is important. 

To ignore what may be a bad idea in terms of bicycle posture and address what seems to be central to your question, which is the reduction of flab, you need to know this about flab: You cannot spot-reduce. With the exception of liposuction. Your DNA determines where your fat ends up. You know how some ladies have normal upper bodies but have very large behinds? Yeah, you do. It's not because they're only active with their upper-half. If you have flab and then develop very strong abdomen muscles, you will have an awesome six-pack covered by flab. If you want the six-pack to show through, you have to lose the fat. Muscle tissue does not transform itself into fat tissue nor vice-versa. The only way to reduce flab in one area of the body is to lose fat period. @Carey Gregory already answered this as a comment but here it is as an answer. I'd recommend the excellent Why We Get Fat by Gary Taubes. Adiposity explained. 

My vote is for replacement. It does after all hold on the brake a very important component. Bending the bolt may cause microscopic cracks that could cause the bolt to fail with no warning. 

If the bike is three or four weeks old it is most likely due for an initial readjustment. It takes a few weeks for the cables to stretch a bit and the derailleurs and springs to seat. This is why most shops want you to return the bike after a month or so to retorque the hardware and readjust the shifters usually for free. 

I am posting this as an answer but it is more of a long comment. The information I have is from the place I trust to do carbon repairs. According to Hot Tubes aluminum and the carbon resin react. The aluminum must be sealed to get a good bond. The materials are not your hardware grade epoxy. If we were talking about a fishing rod or something that would not cause serious injury in the event of failure I would say go for and try to fix it yourself. My thought is there is enough information and the resulting horror stories of catastrophic frame/component failure to warrant at least getting a professional opinion. 

SRAM's current lowest-level groupset is Apex, which is a ten-speed setup and Rider_X says that SRAM have never made a nine-speed road groupset. Campagnolo also only seem to offer ten- and eleven-speed, so Shimano Sora is the only nine-speed in the current line-ups of the big three. 

Alternatively, take the wheel off your bike and use your friend's scooter to carry just the wheel to a place where you can repair it. 

No, the behaviour you're observing doesn't mean there's anything wrong with your bike. You're just travelling faster than you can pedal in a particular gear. For a moment, let's forget about descending and suppose that you're travelling on a level road, so the only thing that's pushing you forward is your pedalling. In principle, you can travel at any speed in any gear, as long as you can pedal fast enough. In reality, of course, there's a limit to how fast you can spin the pedals: your legs can only move so fast. Now, think about what happens if you stop pedalling while you're moving forwards: the bike starts to freewheel. In fact, this will happen whenever you're pedalling slower than the bike is moving. You can try this out. As you're cycling along, pedal slower for a moment, and you'll notice two things: first, you'll hear the clicks of the freewheel as the bike coasts; second, pedalling is very easy because all you're doing is turning the cranks, chainrings, chain and rear cassette. None of your effort is going into moving the bike forwards. This is exactly what's happening while you're descending: you're not pedalling fast enough to match the actual speed of your bike, so you're still coasting and the pedals are very easy to turn. This is a perfectly normal situation: there's nothing wrong with the bike and you don't have to do anything about it. However, even if you're freewheeling down a descent, I would recommend that you change into a gear that's appropriate for the speed you're travelling at, or your highest gear if you don't have a gear high enough. At some point, you will want to pedal again, either because you slowed down (corner, traffic, lesser gradient, bottom of the hill, etc.) or just because you want to go faster. If you're in an appropriate gear, you can just pedal and drive the bike forward. If you're in too low a gear, the pedals will spin with no resistance, which can be a huge surprise that throws you off-balance and causes a crash. Correspondingly, when you do start to pedal again, always start somewhat tentatively to make sure your gear is appropriate. It's when you push hard against no resistance that you're thrown off balance. 

Just to illustrate that there are better and worse ways to apply brakes, here's an example of a less-than-ideal way: I was biking on a borrowed bike and getting used to the brakes. The front brake lever was squishier than the rear. After skidding out and landing my hip on a stump, which lowered morale significantly for the next half-hour or so, I learned to give the front brake a harder squeeze to compensate for the squish. This was on a mountain trail and at the urging of my biking companion on that day. So my question is this: How does one brake under certain circumstances? Are there times when all-front or all-rear braking makes sense, or is it always best to apply pressure somewhat evenly to both brakes, and are there different braking techniques on roads vs trails and such? 

At the risk of sounding like a bumpkin, why do I see some bikes sold without pedals or at least pictured without pedals? Is there some kind of benefit to buying pedals separately? Do some people take their pedals off the bike when not in use, like they might take off their wheels or seat post? 

Assuming a completely smooth road and neglecting the weight of the wheels, it makes no difference: you still need to do the same amount of work. Essentially, larger wheels give you a higher gear ratio, so doubling the diameter of the wheels would mean you'd only need to turn them half as many times, so you'd only need to turn the pedals half as many times, but you need to press twice as hard on them. But, in reality, there are limits to what you can do. If you need to lift 100kg of wood, it's easier to lift 10kg at a time, even though the total work done is the same as when you lift the whole lot at once. Similarly, you'll be more physiologically efficent (and comfortable!) pedalling with certain ranges of cadence and force. Bigger wheels roll over bumps better. As an easy thought experiment, consider a pit whose width is equal to the diameter of your wheel. Obviously, the wheel will fall right into the pit. But if you consider a wheel with twice that diameter, it will only drop a little way into the pit as it bridges over it. In practice, though, there aren't a whole lot of wheel sizes to choose from. Either you get a folding bike with small wheels, or you get a non-folding bike with wheels about 62cm/29in in diameter (or about 56cm/26in for mountain bikes). 

You may have to do some searching to find the right sizes but you could go with stainless steel hardware. Buying them in small quantities can be expensive. I have had issues with some hardware that is countersunk. Conventional allenheads won't fit in the hole. Maybe that is why they call the brand "Specialized". 

The inexpensive bottle cages can be bent to make them a little smaller for a tighter fit. If the type you have is a closed loop type you can add rubber bands to the bottle for a more secure fit if it is loose. There seems to be a lot more size variation with generic "sport bottles" than the bottles marketed to cyclists. 

I have no experience with this drum set up but with similar industrial applications centering the brake band is critical.I would measure from the inner brake surface to the inside of the housing.Do this at several points.If it is off center one side makes contact and the otherside vibrates causeing the noise.Cleaning of the drum surface is important,try alcohol.If the brake material is leather Idont know what to clean it with.If it an organic material sand lightly with medium sand paper. 

Also, you should definitely consider repairing your inner tubes. It's easy, saves a lot of money and the repaired tube is just as strong as the original. Also, it helps you diagnose the problem, as discussed above. 

Yet another problem with this scheme is that, actually, riders with drop handlebars tend to spend most of their time riding "on the hoods", like this: 

You usually spend much more time cycling along the road than stationary on your bike with your feet on the ground. Given that, it makes sense to sit in a position that makes cycling work better, as long as it doesn't make it too difficult to stop. The standard recommendation for saddle height is that your leg should be almost straight with your heel on the pedal in its lowest position. That way, when you pedal with the balls of your feet, your leg is slightly bent at the bottom of each stroke. This is the most efficient way to pedal; pedaling with a bigger bend to your knee means you need to exert more force with your butt muscles, and transmit more force through your knees. That requires more effort and can cause injuries. It makes going up hills much harder. With your saddle at the right height, you should still be able to reach the ground with the toes of either foot, but probably not both at the same time. You might need to lean the bike over slightly, but probably not much. That's all you need to be stable when you stop. If you're going to be stopped for a longer time you can always get off the saddle and stand in front of it, straddling the crossbar, with one foot flat on the ground and the other on the pedal. If you find that you can't comfortably reach the ground with the saddle at the optimum height for pedaling, you can always lower it a little. Note that you don't need to be super-aero just because your saddle's at the correct height. You can always raise your handlebars so you can cycle more comfortably.
