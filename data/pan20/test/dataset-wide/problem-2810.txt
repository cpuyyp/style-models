No, it's not an argumentum ad ignorantiam. It only says that one should never claim that God doesn't exist [with absolute certainty] because there is indeed no way to prove this nonexistence. One can make claims about the likelihood of the existence or nonexistence of God, but there is no way to disprove with absolute certainty that he doesn't exist. If someone said that he is absolutely, 100% certain that God does not exist, he would make a mistake, and that is all your quote says. 

This is basically the rebuttal to the first-cause argument. If the universe had a first-cause (God), then what caused God to exist? Since the creator of the universe must be more complex than its creation (that's what's usually assumed), this is not the best explanation. In other words, it's easier to explain how the universe came into being (without God), then how a God with such capacity came into being. Another well-established concept in science is that you favor the least complex hypothesis, unless there is a good reason to favor a more complex hypothesis. This is called "Ockham's Razor". 

Here, the implication in step 1, as absurd as it may sound, is true. This may illustrate the point I made in the previous example: the implication can be quite troublesome at times. In real-life, this will often occur in a more subtle manner. For instance: Argument by proponent: 

I'm looking for an encyclopaedic overview, which can be used as a study resource. By this, I mean a book in which all important philosophers are explained very concisely (2-3 pages per philosopher on average; someone like Kant more, of course). The closest thing I can think of (in style) is a university syllabus or a powerpoint presentation, in which subjects are explained very briefly, usually in lists with bullet points. What I am not looking for: 

Kant was the one who introduced the distinction between noumena and phenomena, but if we make abstraction of this terminology and its very specific meaning, I think we can trace this back to the very beginning of Western philosophy. In fact, the distinction between fundamental reality and our perception is very common in ontology. Please note that my "overview" is far from complete. It is only meant to give some insight into thinkers before Kant who worked on similar ideas. The Milesians The Milesians were the first who were looking for the true nature of reality; the fundamental building block of everything. For Thales, this was water, for Anaximander the Apeiron and for Anaximenes air. Please note that this is still very different from Kant's Critical Idealism. The Milesians didn't say that reality is constructed by the mind (even though Kant's Critical Idealism recognises the existence of a real, objective world, which is necessary for us to see those representations); they only said that there is a fundamental, underlying principle of reality. Parmenides Parmenides said that fundamental reality is unchanging and that the change we perceive is nothing but our senses deceiving us. There is the unchanging world of pure, real, reasonable knowledge, the kind of knowledge only the philosopher, which stands in contrast to the changing world of the imaginary and the deceiving, the kind of knowledge the layman has access to. Again, this is still quite different from Kant's Critical Idealism, but it's getting closer in the sense that the real, objective, unchanging world (which can be compared to Kant's noumena) stands in contrast with the deceptive world of the senses (which can be compared to Kant's phenomena) Parmenides will have a huge influence on Plato, which will show up in his Ideas and the Allegory of the Cave. Plato Plato's Allegory of the Cave distinguishes fundamental reality very clearly from representations. 

Reading original texts Once you know enough about political philosophy in general, you can start reading original texts. The very first you should read, is Plato's Republic. Whether you like it or not, other philosophers will refer to it over and over again and it is important to understand it well. A companion is recommended too to make sure you get the most out of it. I've included a TTC-course and a book. 

While this seems very clear at first, it seems rather absurd to say that one can not speak about ethics altogether. This would be very problematic; how can we teach people about morality? Through our actions only? Also, some of the implications would include that we wouldn't be able to condone any wrongdoings: slavery, human rights violations, terrorism,... these can be talked about as propositions (i.e. as facts), but are all of equal value. This would obviously be problematic. So my actual question is: should we, according to Wittgenstein, really remain totally silent about ethics altogether (i.e. not talk about it in any way)? And if this is the case, then how would he deal with the issues I raised? Would he resolve them all by showing value through actions? And how exactly would he do so? 

The above possibilities are the only operators used in modal logic in the narrow sense. However, the term modal logic is often used to include other extensions, for instance temporal logic, that allows for the expression of past or future truths. Why is modal logic useful? Classic logic is great for mathematics, but for the analysis of daily language and arguments, it lacks certain operators. There are many sentences that you can't express in classic logic that can be expressed in modal logic. Example: "I may get burned if I lie in the sun for too long". In classic logic, you can say: "I get burned if I lie in the sun for too long", but you can't express the possibility of getting burned. In classic logic, it's either true or false. In modal logic, you can also express the possibility or impossibility of a proposition being true or false. Further reading: 

A dogma refers to (usually a religious) teaching that is considered undoubtedly and absolutely true. It is something you accept without any direct observation; dogmas are accepted by faith only. I should add that some people would say that there is no difference between axioms and dogmas, because 'self-evident truths' are in some sense based on faith; that is that you accept on faith that anything that seems obvious and self-evident is true. An interesting read on this subject is Wittgenstein's On Certainty. I also want to stress that I don't mean to say that an axiom is "better" than a religious dogma (or vice versa for that matter). 

So, what this effectively shows is that, if you derive moral goodness from the argument of design (or any other argument from which you shouldn't/can't derive moral goodness), then you can also derive moral evil from that same argument, i.e. you cannot draw any conclusions about whether god is omnibenevolent or not based on this argument alone. Therefore, deriving whether god is (supremely) good or not requires other arguments. 

... and most notably Charles Sanders Pierce, who wrote about his consensus theory of truth, sometimes referred to as the convergence theory of truth: 

Introductions First of all, make you sure you have a good knowledge of general philosophy before you start reading political philosophy. This is not mandatory, but I think you may encounter some problems if you don't know the very basic terms, philosophers and ideas. To get started with political philosophy, I would recommend the following: 

You have only given step 1 and step 2; you didn't accept step 3, rejecting the consequent (Q). Since the implication (P->Q) holds (step 1) and P is indeed a fallacious argument (step 2), there is no fallacy. If you had concluded that 2+3+1=7 was wrong based on the antecedent - and not on your own 'mathematical intuition', then it would have been a fallacy. The implication "If 2+3=6, then 2+3+1=7" is true, since both the antecedent and the consequent are false. You can look at the truth table for this: 

I found it very hard to find any context for the quote you mentioned, but I believe that he means that common sense should only be applied to common, everyday situations (on which it is based), rather than also applying it to deep and unintuitive physics or other fields to which common sense shouldn't be applied for the same reason. Common sense is about common, simple, everyday situations ("its own field" in Einstein's quote); it shouldn't be applied to uncommon, complex decisions or complex theories. People aren't sufficiently aware of these limitations of common sense. Duncan Watts, author of "Everything is obvious", gives the following example from policy-making: 

Is there such thing as "African philosophy"? By this, I mean: (a) is there "real philosophy" in Africa (non-mythical and non-religious attempts to explain reality, find an ethical framework,...) and (b) can we speak of an African tradition like we do in Western philosophy (responses to and criticism of earlier philosophers,...)? Who are some of the notable thinkers and what were their philosophies? How did "African philosophy" develop over time? Which texts are must-reads and/or good introductions? 

Logical positivism is often taught as one of the three new schools of philosophy, together with pragmatism and phenomenology, that went against traditional philosophy in a radical manner. While I am certainly not disputing that rejecting metaphysics and reducing all sensible statements to either logical tautologies or verifiable claims is no small feat, some parts of Ayer's Language, Truth, Logic have led me to reconsider this a little bit. 

There is nothing wrong with step 1 and 2. The implication (step 1) holds and "2+3=6" is false (step 2). It does not logically follow, however, that "4+4=8" is false (step 3). Note that the implication in step 1 also holds, but that there is a difference with the previous example I gave. Here the antecedent is false, but the consequent is true (which can lead to the fallacy fallacy). Truth table: 

That is true, but the quote specifically says "if he is only interested in money", it does not say "if he is corrupt". It is thus not a fallacy for that reason. However, it could be interpreted as: "(A) He leaves a position that pays more, thus (B) he is not only interested in money." While A is true, we are not sure whether B is true. It does not follow from A that B is true, since leaving a high-paying job is not a sufficient condition for not being interested in money, as you correctly pointed out. This is an example of a non sequitur. 

I think the analogy made by Joseph Weissman ("This sort of feels like asking "why are higher mathematics any better/more interesting than elementary mathematics?"") is quite accurate. Almost everyone uses arithmetic every day, when grocery shopping, DIY, etc. The vast majority of 'mathematical problems' (in the widest sense of the word, obviously) that the general public encounters can be solved with arithmetic alone. Does that mean there is no point in studying more advanced mathematics? Of course there is, but the further you advance, the less explicit the applications become. In other words, the more advanced, the less direct, practical applications it seems to have for the general public. Also, keep in mind that discovering the usefulness of a skill (and its beauty) often comes after having learned that skill, not before learning it. One thing formal logic can do is take ambiguous statements and make them less ambiguous, but this comes at a cost: simplification. This is a criticism I've heard before made by students who take a first course in logic: "it's much too restricted to grasp the full extent of real-life problems." I wouldn't completely disagree with that, if you keep in mind they've only studied propositional and the beginnings of predicate logic. While classic propositional logic can grasp a wide range of problems, there are also many problems that cannot be analysed by propositional logic alone. We move on to predicate logic; the addition of only two quantifiers makes predicate logic much more capable. Every new kind of logic basically does the same thing: you add new tools (operators, quantifiers, truth values) to make the analysis of more complex problems possible whilst keeping the unambiguity of formal logical analysis. In other words, studying more advanced logic - logics 'beyond' propositional and predicate logic - allows you to analyse more problems and do so more accurately (i.e. with less simplification).
