Apart from the first option which you can do easily at home the other two would have some cost attached and in order to get the right fit it is best to try some different options. You should be able to go to your LBS and get their advice on fitting and what changes you should make. They will probably let you try out different combinations of stem and seat before purchasing. 

Mount a roof rack and use a carrier. This is a medium cost, semi permanent (roof rack can be removed) and medium effort to get bike up and down. 

I'm interested in using BSA crank parts with a certain BB30 frame and I'm a little unclear about cable routing, I'm hoping somebody here can help clarify the confusion. I'm considering purchasing a Dengfu FM286: $URL$ The concern is that I'm going to use a BSA crank parts and they only have a BB30 frame available in my size (3 month wait for BSA version in the proper size). I'm under the impression that frames with internal cable routing can allow the cables to pass the BB area in one of two ways, either through the BB opening, or underneath on the bottom of the frame in tubes, is this correct? For the typical BB30 to BSA adapters, for example: $URL$ $URL$ I'm under the impression that these could be used on a frame where the cables route in tubes underneath the frame, but could not be used in a frame where cables route through the BB opening, correct? If so, here is the further confusion on my part. I emailed Dengfu pertaining to the frame linked above, and received this response: "I show you pictures of BSA adapter and BB30 frame bottom. You can install cables internally." Here are the pics they sent: 

Research websites like Bikepedia and Norco.com and check the original spec. You've possibly done this already and found it's of little help. Pull the cranks off and remove the BB length and diameter will be printed on it. You're looking to take it off anyway. Remove everything and measure, this will be most complicated and a last resort. 

I'm currently putting a bike together with recycled parts and want to get away with not having to purchase a new gear wire. On my first attempt to thread the RD wire I ended up fraying it, cutting off too big a length and having to purchase a replacement. The old FD wire is too short so I want to switch the wire from the right to the left shifter. New cables are cut and 'sealed' in a way that they're easy to thread. For a used wire what is the best way to: 

I'm under the impression that "O.L.D." = Over-Lock-nut Distance, i.e. the width of the axle between the threads, which should correspond to the distance between the inside of the drop-outs on the frame. I'm trying to figure out what the drop-down options mean and which is the correct choice in my case. Here's my best guess as to an expanded explanation of the options in the drop-down (also using the information from the description section): "QR / QR for Shimano/Sram 10,11s" means: front axle is a traditional quick release (100 mm wide), rear axle is a traditional quick release (135 mm wide), compatible with Shimano or Sram 10 or 11 speed cassettes "15mm / 135mm QR for Shimano/Sram 10,11s" means: front axle is a thru-axle (15 mm diameter, 100 mm wide), rear axle is a traditional quick release (135 mm wide), compatible with Shimano or Sram 10 or 11 speed cassettes "15mm / 142x12mm for Shimano/Sram 10,11s" means: front axle is a thru-axle (15 mm diameter, 100 mm wide), rear axle is a thru-axle (12 mm diameter, 142 mm wide), compatible with Shimano or Sram 10 or 11 speed cassettes "12mm / 142x12mm for Shimano/Sram 10,11s" means: front axle is a thru-axle (12 mm diameter, 100 mm wide), rear axle is a thru-axle (12 mm diameter, 142 mm wide), compatible with Shimano or Sram 10 or 11 speed cassettes "12mm / 135x12mm for Shimano/Sram 10,11s +$10" means: front axle is a thru-axle (12 mm diameter, 100 mm wide), rear axle is a thru-axle (12 mm diameter, 135 mm wide), compatible with Shimano or Sram 10 or 11 speed cassettes, at $10 additional cost Is my understanding correct? Returning to my specific situation, I'd like to stick with traditional quick-release skewers at both the front and rear, and I used an 11 speed Shimano Ultegra rear derailleur with the FM286 build. So, considering all of the above, I'm under the impression that the correct choice in my case would be the first axle option in the drop-down, "QR / QR for Shimano/Sram 10,11s", correct? Can anybody confirm my understanding of the above? If I'm incorrect in my interpretation anywhere, please clarify, thanks! 

to maintain a symmetrical bottom bracket you need a bottom bracket with the spindle offset to compensate for the width of the e-type plate. These are identified with a -E mark, such as BB-UN25-E and are still available but hard to find and more a specialised product. Here is the 117mm version: 

If you are using any other tyre/ rim combination it's really just luck if you're going to get a tyre to seat with floor pump, compressed air or ever at all. 

So I'm left with some questions: -For the adapter (1st pic), is this a BB30 to BSA adapter with pre-machined holes? It appears to be but I'm not sure -For the frame (2nd pic), does that appear to be a BB30 frame? I would suspect so since there don't appear to be BB threads but I'm not sure. -Also for the frame, are those two tubes on the bottom of the frame (they appear to be gold colored in the pic, but that's probably just the lighting, I would suspect they are actually white) where the cables route through? If so, does that mean any BB30 to BSA adapter could be pressed in and still allow the cable routing, or is it still necessary to utilize the BB hole in some way? I will contact the company further about this, but I'm also interested in the expertise of anybody in this forum that can offer information about BB30 to BSA conversion for an internally routed cable frame, and also your impressions of the images above. Please advise, thanks! 

Although 29ers have been around since the early 80's they have only been in production from a major producer for the last decade. Trek was the first big brand to offer a 29er in early 2000's. Reasons why you may not of seen many are: 

I've done a bit of research but can't seem to find much information on how neck braces actually work to protect the neck. There are many views on whether they are actually effective in reducing serious injuries (in the same way it took a long time for ski snow board helmets to be proven). Neck Braces are a recommended safety item by the UCI for downhill events, unlike full face helmets which are mandatory, but all racers wear them. What do they protect and how do they do that? 

I'm encountering some confusion on frame size and any clarification would be greatly appreciated. I've always been under the impression that a stated frame size was the distance, usually in cm, from the top of the seat tube to the center of the BB opening. For example looking at any of the road bikes on the Trek site: $URL$ For all the bikes the "Frame Size Number" and the "Actual Frame Size" (see the chart at the bottom of the page for any of the bikes) are the same, even for the aero Madone. I'd like to purchase a Dengfu FM098 frame for a bike I'm planning on building: $URL$ The available sizes are listed as "49/52/54/56/58/61cm", but upon going to the Geometry tab this chart is shown: 

I don't tend to carry additional food, just enough for my planned ride and maybe an hours delay. If I had a catastrophic gear failure I'd (and have done) single speed the bike and take the shortest route home (this sucks btw). My biggest concern is punctures. I always carry at least one extra layer of warmth, no matter how warm it is outside you start to cool very quickly when you get off the bike and stop moving. If I get off the bike for any length of time I put a shell jacket on until I'm at a good temp. 

Scrolling down further under the "Description" section the following additional information is found: 

My head is spinning with confusion on BB terminology, I'm hoping somebody can clarify things. I'm interested in building a road bike with the Dengfu FM098 frame and an Ultegra groupset that I would like to purchase from Chain Reaction Cycles. The frame is here: $URL$ And from Chain Reaction the Ultegra groupset can be purchased here with some options: $URL$ or here with pretty much every conceivable option: $URL$ So here is where the confusion begins. The Dengfu link above lists the FM098 Bottom Bracket as "BB: English BB/BB30", I'm under the impression that this means a choice of an "English BB" or a "BB30" bottom bracket, is this correct? Now considering the Chain Reaction Ultegra Groupset links, the one with fewer options does not list an option for BB, rather it states "Incl. Hollowtech II Bottom Bracket SM-BBR60 BSA". The Ultegra Groupset builder with the many options has 2 choices for BB after choosing the Shimano Ultegra 6800 Bottom Bracket option, "English 68mm" or "Italian 70mm" So I checked the Wikipedia page for BBs: $URL$ The table towards the bottom (see the column heading "Bottom Bracket Thread Name") seems to imply that ISO/English & BSC (British Standard Cycle) and BSA all effectively mean the same thing, and that the shell with for these is 68mm. At this point I'm under the impression that the Denfgu "BB: English BB/BB30" means a choice of an English Bottom Bracket or a BB30 Bottom Bracket. I'm also under the impression that the Chain Reaction Cycles Ultegra Groupset with "Incl. Hollowtech II Bottom Bracket SM-BBR60 BSA" would match the Dengfu frame with the English BB option, since BSA seems to mean the same thing as English, and English seems to be 68mm, is this correct? If not, would the Chain Reaction Ultegra Groupset Builder with the "English 68mm" option fit the Dengfu FM098 frame with the "English BB" option (supposing this is actually a separate option from the "BB30" on the Dengfu FM098)? Sorry if this is a beginner question but BB terminology can be quite confusing!
