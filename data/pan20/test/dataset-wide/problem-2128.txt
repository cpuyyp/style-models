It's not unthinkable that you will never get to fully see the effects of your work. A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away, I was involved in building an industrial ERP. The project was far from a typical heavyweight ERP, it was a fully customized solution that dealt with everything, from accounting to precisely monitoring oil levels in a wide range of heavy machinery. We only called it ERP because we couldn't come up with a better description for it. Although it was a fairly boring project, since the solution covered almost every aspect of the client's operations, we had access to every data you can imagine, and then some. Whenever they introduced something new, be it new machinery, a new training program or even a couple of new faces, our little behemoth monitored everything and spat out performance reports by the kilo. Every little tweak in the system was immediately quantifiable, and each one of us had a pretty clear idea of whether our work was beneficial to the client or not. Fast forward a few years, and I'm working as a web developer for a small startup, that invests absolutely no time or resources in collecting such data, or trying to get feedback from clients. Sure, we had the typical automated analytics for all our web sites, but you can only make so much sense out of them. The company was more focused in getting new clients than keeping old ones, and management never saw any value in providing such feedback to us. Our only hope of getting even a vague idea of how beneficial our work had been, was the client calling us directly. Well, it happened. Once. At the end of the day the feedback you are looking for is information that should be passed from the client to your company, and then to you. Somewhere along the way the signal may get lost in the noise, especially if it was noisy to begin with. You should always feel free to ask your boss for feedback, especially since you are starting out, it's only natural to look for self fulfilment. But you should be prepared that you may never get it, ours is a creative craft that's extremely hard to quantify, even when the conditions are ideal. Every now and then someone mentions that they used a website I've build during casual conversation, and that's the closer I get to seeing the “real” accomplishments of my work. Unless of course something particularly nasty happens, then suddenly everyone seems to remember I was involved in the project, even if it's been almost a decade since I worked at the company that build the damn thing. 

You say that asking him to stop talking to himself worked, even if you had to ask multiple times, why not just do that again? Politely explain that his behaviour is distracting you and try to find a solution to the problem with him. You mention that moving to a different office / space is not an option for you, but perhaps it's an option for him? If talking to him fails and since you've already tried headphones and earplugs, your last option would be to talk to your manager. Again politely explain that your co-worker is unnecessarily distracting and his behaviour is affecting your work, and let them deal with the issue. Do not: 

You don't try to figure out when the deadline is, you just ask. Any speculation on your part will probably be false, and even if you get it right once in awhile, deadlines aren't really something you should be speculating on. Just ask. If the answer is "do it as soon as possible", then do it as soon as possible. 

All the tools allow you to create and store the documents online, and of course store locally, in popular formats, PDF, OpenOffice formats, Microsoft Word, and XML, and offer quite a few examples and ready made templates. Although not an official format, it's widely used, to the point that it could be considered a de facto standard. If you are looking for work within the European Union, you should consider creating a Europass, regardless of whether you are a European citizen or not. 

What you are looking for is a tailored employee reward / incentive program, rewards could be anything really, from cash, either through target bonuses or raises, to schedule flexibility, cool new toys and promotional items. Personally I enjoy getting first choice on projects, and a bit more flexibility when it comes to working hours and vacation time but you will have to tailor the program to your team and company culture. It's a bit trial and error, there isn't a one fits all solution and it will fail horribly if you don't have solid performance metrics. If after a while you see that you only reward the same couple of people, just promote them already, and continue the program for the rest of the team. If you are looking for non monetary awards, you should take a look at this excellent article, from which I think the more feasible rewards for a small company are: 

I'm favoring quiet work environments, and when I had similar conflicts in the past, using chat for short conversations worked beautifully, and (almost) everyone was happy. In combination with headphones for the music lovers and taking longer conversations out of the room, everyone was happy ;) 

Now, one could argue that for the first couple of reasons it would make sense to post a listing in both a job board and the company web site. Well, that's really a question of cost, effort and value, in some instances it makes sense and in some it doesn't. If the job board provides an API or any other easy technical way of accessing your own data, the cost and effort are significantly smaller, as most of the process is automated. In conclusion, it's not unreasonable for companies to only post listings in job board sites and you shouldn't really worry about it. 

I do get that you are approaching this from an ethical and not a contractual standpoint, however I feel that clauses 3 to 5 give a very good idea of what's generally accepted and what not when it comes to employees blogging about their work related activities. At the end of the day it's up to you to apply good judgement and decide whether what you write on your blog may , but if in doubt you can always ask: Show a draft of your post to your manager or to your co-workers, after all they are going to read it anyways after you post it. 

You've already answered your question there. From a job responsibility standpoint this is a clear cut decision, you should go for it, and it's the developers' job to fix any issues you identify. 

Antagonizing him will be extremely counter-productive, even offensive, and if you are annoyed by his sounds it's possible others are too, do you really want to contribute to the problem by making more sounds? 

One of my colleagues received a very critical (and unsolicited) email for our company, from a past associate1, through a social network. My colleague informed me, his immediate superior, and my first reaction was to completely dismiss the matter. On second thought, however, I'm not sure if I'm under any obligation to inform the higher ups. The email paints quite a dark picture of the company in 2011, and for all I know everything in it may very well be true (albeit exaggerated). I wasn't with the company at the time, but I do know it was a very difficult time for all professionals in Greece (the debt crisis was in full swing). The email ends with encouraging my colleague to seek other employment. Is there any value in further pursuing this? 1 I don't think it matters, but I'm not 100% certain on what his status was at the time. Could have been a full time employee or an outside contractor. 

The company web site doesn't support an easy way of posting and maintaining listings This may sound unrealistic but if you think about it, job listings websites are designed exactly for that purpose, and offer a far friendlier interface to post and more importantly keep track of and organize listings, and collect and archive resumes. Some countries may have specific regulations when it comes to collecting resumes, and it makes much more sense to make use of a job board that already follows them. In most company websites I've developed such facilities were not asked for, and when I proposed them, the common response was "well, we are using careers site and we are happy with it". The company web site doesn't really have that much traffic For companies that don't have much use of their web site other than simply having some sort of on-line presence, it makes much more sense to post their listings at a site where they'll be way more visible, especially from the job seeker's perspective. The company doesn't want to directly advertise they are hiring Several companies opt to post listings on job boards anonymously, and only reveal themselves at a later stage of the hiring process. Even if they do post under the company name, it's far less likely that their listings will be found by people who usually check their company web site, employees, clients and competitors.
