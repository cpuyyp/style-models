Wow tuff call Don't know where you live but a longer notice is probably not the best route. In many locations they can terminate you immediately once they have your resignation. If you want to give them a heads up talk to the person that is scheduling the training and let them know that you are considering other employment. Especially if you are on good terms with that person. They would have to outright fire you and depending on local law that may not even be a valid cause for dismissal. In the overall scheme of things two weeks of training is not that big of a deal. The bigger impact to the company is they are losing a person they want to be lead in a technology. Having the replacement put in 2 weeks of training is just not that big of a deal. 

For limited jobs yes the university is deal breaker. For a majority of jobs the university is just a factor. Top grades and mid university is probably better then mid grades at a top university. Top grades at a top university is going to be the most attractive. I don't think moving the order of education versus work history is going to matter. But why not give it a try. If you have an impressive work history then put it first. 

Your job is more important than your position. You have been told taking calls is a priority. If you don't follow that priority that is not going to save the position. As long as your boss knows the tasks are not being completed because of time on phone then there is nothing else you should do. I agree with the comment log how much time you spend on calls and the backlog size at the time you were asked to take calls. 

Many recruiters would not know. For a sure a word search would not know. Yes list it if you think there is a market. 

If she is otherwise productive and pleasant there has to be fix here. Get her to admit she does not like touching keyboards. Tell her she can have her own keyboard and mouse. Offer everyone a personal key and mouse. The team may think it is a little strange but it is easy enough to accommodate. 

Where do you live? In the US you can go to the state labor commission. They are also not paying taxes on that money. I worked at a job where they only paid us when the customer paid. Someone turned them in and boom we all got paid and it was not disclosed who turned them in. If you have to be named on the suit then I agree that is a different situation. If you have a labor union you can report to them. 

IANAL (I Am Not A Lawyer) A non-compete contract with the employee would not work as you don't compete with the service provider. I think you could specify a clause in the contract with the service provide that they pay you $X if they hire any of your employees. This is common with consulting agencies. 

When you are assigned a task and a deadline you need to stand up and tell them the deadline is not realistic. Tell them you will analyze the task and come back with a deadline. Give them x man-weeks and when they say well work more than 40 tell them that is based on my current man-week and it is more than 40. If they slide an emergency task them tell them which task(s) will be delayed. 

It can vary but if you have an architect and that is how they chose to handle the role there is not much you can do about it. And you will get the shit projects. One argument is everything the same way even if it is not the best for each individual program has maintenance value. If you argue they just seem to clamp down more. Take challenge in making their way work. Where I get fairly frustrated is when I know I would personally test a 2 or more approaches to see what works best. If I know performance is going to tank I will bring it up quietly once and then just let their design tank. What is really fun is when the data base architect does not have to conform to the software architect and your business objects don't align with the database design. I have been there and you just need to let them duke it out. When software architect (that does not know database) tells a database architect how to do database design things really get fun. 

If it is a competitve salary doing work you enjoy then why not. How can you assume will be overworked? What is wrong with promotions? If a small company grows there are more opportunities for promotions. And some investors make nothing. If the start up fails you get to keep your salary. By that logic should you take corporate job without shares? In another question you complain about lots of politics and manager taking credit for your ideas. A small start up is not likely to have those problems. The stated question is take a job without equity. And the answer is simple. If the job, salary, and benefits is competitive then why not? You are not getting equity at a large company. Evaluate the offer for what it is. A start up is not necessarily a sweat shop. It may be well funded and they already have the core competency and you are just a valued well paid employee. If they need your skills to develop the core competency then yes they are going to offer shares. If they offer a lower salary and shares then you have to compare that to another a higher offer with no shares. 

In a comment you said he is picking up extra tasks that are priority Yes by working 14 hours a day he is putting out more work than you. Yes he should be rewarded for putting out more work if it is quality work. Most likely he cannot sustain that pace. By the hour you are probably making more. If you want to work more to keep up is really life balance decision you are going to need to make. As other have said working 14 hours a days is typically not more productive over the long haul. 

If you back out on employer B then consider that bridge burned. Decide soon and just tell them. You need to decide if employer A is sincere. 50% and a promotion is sweet if it is real - they intend to keep you long term. Was HR, your boss, and your bosses boss involved? A promotion and no overtime is a little inconsistent. But a promotion kind of legitimizes it. If they were just giving you money to keep you around long enough to replace you then there is no purpose to giving you a promotion. Is your boss someone you trust? Do you know of anyone else that was given a counter offer and retained long term? Even if they do dump you in 6 months you have higher position and 50% more pay but it is also harder to find a job without a job and if they are that spiteful then you are not likely to get a positive referral. 

Legal questions are out of scope. Would NOT be good ethics to share or use the information. How valuable would that information be anyway? So a meeting request from competitor. Now if you came across a price quote from a competitor that would be valuable. But it would also be even less ethical to use. 

If this is an aggressive VP that just wants his guy then argue is not going to get you very far. Your non-compete is very critical to how hard you can push. If you cannot move to a competing company for X months you have very little strength. If you can move and are willing to leave and customers may come with you then you can take a hard line but be careful. I know a girl that built up her district 3 times only to have it taken from her to be put in the worst district. On the 3rd time she found another job. 

Finders fees are common. It kind of depends on what basically of "basically I have brought them as customers" is. For a qualified lead ready to buy and you have a high conversion rate then yes. If it is just I am interested where can a I get a quote then no. I disagree with another answer on must it be a decision maker. If a tech team puts your company on the short list because of your input that is valuable. You have the option to blog about the open source and never refer them. You should not blog about the services of you company if this is a personal blog. If your boss says no then just drop it. 

I get this is a little out there but this is my idea. They have a maximum they are willing to pay. But they want to get you for your minimum. You want their maximum and it must be more than your minimum. You don't know their maximum and they don't know you minimum. They write down their maximum and you write down your minimum. Your both turn over your numbers. If their maximum is greater than you minimum then you split the difference. If their maximum is less than your minimum then no deal.
