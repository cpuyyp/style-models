If $n \notin A$, then $B_n$ is arithmetically generic, and if $n \in A$, then $B_n$ is $(n+1)$-generic and computable from $0^{(n+1)}$. Hence $\{n \in \mathbb{N} : \text{$B_n$ is arithmetic}\}$ is equal to $A$. For each $k \in \N$, let $m_i$ be the $i$th element of the set $\{m \in \N : m \notin A \lor m \geq k\}$. Then $C_k = \bigoplus_{i \in \omega} B_{m_i}$ is $(k+1)$-generic. 

A $B$ with the above two properties gives a positive answer to your question by the following reasoning. We can prove by induction that for any $n$, $B^{(n)} \equiv_T 0^{(n)} \oplus C_{n}$. This is trivial when $n = 0$. Now for the inductive case, assume $B^{(n)} \equiv_T 0^{(n)} \oplus C_{n}$. Then we see that $B^{(n+1)} \equiv_T (0^{(n)} \oplus C_n)' \equiv_T 0^{(n+1)} \oplus C_n$ since $C_n$ is $(n+1)$-generic and hence $1$-generic relative to $0^{(n)}$. Finally, $0^{(n+1)} \oplus C_n \equiv_T 0^{(n+1)} \oplus C_{n+1}$ because either $n \notin A$ and so $C_n = C_{n+1}$ or $n \in A$ so $C_{n+1} \equiv_T B_n \oplus C_n$, but then $B_n \leq_T 0^{(n+1)}$. Hence, $B^{(n)}$ cannot compute $A$ for any $n \in \omega$, since $C_{n}$ is $(n+1)$-generic, and so $0^{(n)} \oplus C_{n} \ngeq_T 0^{(n+1)}$. (Indeed, it's easy to see that $B$ is $GL_n$ for every $n \in \N$). Thus, $A$ is not arithmetically definable relative to $B$. 

Let P be a simple polytope defined as an intersection of n halfspaces. A facet F of P, supported by halfspace H, is removable if the intersection of the remaining (n-1) halfspaces is bounded. F is projectively removable if there exists a projective transformation π such that π(F) is removable from π(P). It is easy to show that every facet of a simple d-polytope with at least (d+2) facets is projectively removable, since there is a projective transformation mapping (d+1) of the remaining halfspaces into a (d)-simplex. Consider a vertex v defined by the intersection of d halfspaces and lying on a removable facet F supported by halfspace H. Suppose we translate H along its normal axis away from the center of the polytope out towards infinity. As we do so, some vertices will disappear from F as the corresponding halfspaces no longer intersect H within the polytope. At the time just before H leaves the polytope entirely there will be exactly d vertices left on F. Define v to be a final vertex if, when H is translated out of P in this way, v is one of the d vertices remaining on F. 

There are $B$ with this property. Lets first recall some definitions and notation. Suppose $X \in 2^\omega$ (which we identify with subsets of $\N$ via characteristic functions). Then $X'$ is the Turing jump of $X$, and $X^{(n)}$ is the nth iterate of the Turing jump of $X$. $X$ is said to be $n$-generic (i.e. $\Sigma^0_n$-generic for Cohen forcing) if for every $\Sigma^0_n$ subset $S$ of $2^{< \omega}$ there is a finite initial segment $\sigma$ of $X$ so that either $\sigma \in S$, or there are no extensions of $\sigma$ contained in $S$. $X$ is said to be arithmetically generic if $X$ is $n$-generic for every $n$. It is a standard fact that if $X$ is $1$-generic, then $X' \equiv_T 0' \oplus X$, where $\oplus$ is recursive join. We also have that if $X$ is $n$-generic and $Y$ is $1$-generic relative to $X \oplus 0^{(n-1)}$, then $X \oplus Y$ is $n$-generic. Finally, if $X_0, X_1, \ldots \in 2^\omega$, then $\bigoplus_n X_n = \{\langle n, m \rangle: m \in X_n\}$ notes their recursive join. Let $A = 0^{(\omega)} = \bigoplus_{n} 0^{(n)}$; the set of true sentences in first order arithmetic. Below, we will construct a $B$ so that: 

Based on what I believe I understand about projective transformations, I can imagine that there is a projective transformation that shrinks F to an arbitrarily small point, and another transformation that perturbs F so that a given vertex "sticks out" enough to be a final vertex. However, I am not clear how to show from a formal definition of projective transformations that such transformations always exist or that there exists a given transformation that imposes both properties. As a continuation of this question, let me ask: how can I gain more intuition about what properties of a polytope can be modified by projective transformation? Can facets be scaled arbitrarily and edges shifted around as I have suggested? I have taken a look at some texts suggested in Ziegler about projective geometry, but I'm interested in knowing more precisely what kind of things projective transformations can and cannot do to polytopes. 

Let P be a simple n-facet d-polytope with facet F, and let F have k vertices. Let H be a halfspace and Q be a simple (n-1)-facet polytope such that H ∩ Q = P. In terms of k, what is an upper bound on the number of vertices of Q contained in (ℝd \ H)? Informally: what is the largest number of vertices of Q that can be chopped off to produce a k-vertex facet F? I've derived an algorithm to compute this value exactly in terms of the f-vector of F, but I'd like to determine a tight upper bound when the f-vector is unavailable. Some observations: The removed set of vertices cannot contain a facet of Q, thus there would seem to be an upper limit on its size. k ≥ d, naturally, since cutting off a single vertex produces d vertices. If this question is particularly difficult or contains any open problems of which I'm not aware, I'd be interested in knowing that, too! 

So lets turn now to the construction of a $B$ with the required properties (1) and (2) above. We construct $B$ in countably many steps where after step $n$ we will have completely defined $B_0, B_1, \ldots, B_n$ and finitely many other bits of $B$ (i.e. finitely many bits of finitely many $B_i$ where $i > n$). For step $0$, let $B_0$ be an arbitrary real satisfying condition (1). Given $k \leq n$, let $m_0, \ldots, m_j$ be the elements of $\{m \in \mathbb{N}: m \notin A \lor m \geq k\} \cap \{0, \ldots, n\}$, and define $C_{k,n} = B_{m_0} \oplus \ldots \oplus B_{m_j}$. After each stage $n$, we will have ensured that $C_{n,k}$ is $(k+1)$-generic for every $k \leq n$. Now at step $n > 0$, for each pair $(i,k)$ where $i,k < n$, do the following. Let $S_{i,k}$ be the $i$th $\Sigma^0_{k+1}$ subset of $2^{< \omega}$. If we can find a finite extension of our approximation of $B$ so that the resulting approximation of $C_k$ extends an element of $S_{i,k}$, then extend our approximation of $B$ in this way. If this is not possible, then since $C_{k,n-1}$ is $(k+1)$-generic, there must be some finite subset of our current approximation to $B$ which cannot be extended to extend an element of $S_{i,k}$. Next, we finish step $n$ by defining $B_n$. If $n \notin A$ pick $B_n$ to be an element of $2^{\omega}$ extending the finite approximation of $B_n$ that we currently have, which is arithmetically generic relative to $B_0 \oplus \ldots \oplus B_{n-1}$. This clearly ensures that $C_{k,n}$ will be $(k+1)$-generic for each $k < n$, since $C_{k,n-1}$ is $(k+1)$-generic, and $B_n$ is $(k+1)$-generic relative to it. Similarly, $C_{n,n}$ is clearly $(n+1)$-generic. Otherwise, if $n \in A$, let $B_n$ be an arbitrary $(n+1)$-generic computable from $0^{(n+1)}$ and extending the finitely many bits of $B_n$ we have already determined. Now for any $k < n$, let $j_0, \ldots, j_t$ be the elements of $A$ that are $\geq k$ and $< n$. Then since $B_n$ is $1$-generic relative to $0^{(n)}$ which can compute $B_{j_0} \oplus \ldots \oplus B_{j_t}$ we have that $B_{j_0} \oplus \ldots \oplus B_{j_t} \oplus B_n$ is $(k+1)$-generic. Hence $C_{k,n}$ is $(k+1)$-generic, since the remaining elements in the finite join defining $C_{k,n}$ are mutually arithmetically generic (and are hence $(k+1)$-generic relative to $B_{j_0} \oplus \ldots \oplus B_{j_t} \oplus B_n$). Similarly, $C_{n,n}$ is again clearly $n+1$-generic. To verify that our construction works, note that condition (1) is satisfied by how we pick $B_n$ in the last paragraph. Condition (2) is satisfied by the paragraph before that. 

You could get a little more involved with (2), and check for positive $h$-triangles of every link in the complex, since a link in a shellable complex is shellable. In practice, when I've had complexes that I've wanted to computationally check shellability on, I've generally found the combination of the two approaches to give me an answer. You can either first check for obvious non-shellability with (2), and if everything is positive apply (1); or else first check shellability with (1), and if the computation appears to hang, then look for a negative entry in the $h$-triangle. (But this works for me partly because the complexes I look at usually arise from some kind of "nice" combinatorial object or process.) 

Are you running computer experiments to verify conjectures? If so, the GAP SmallGroups library will give you exactly what you want up to $n = 1023$. For example, the GAP commands 

I'm very slow to respond, but have finally found some time to put your complex into GAP and examine it. Questions on $k$-decomposability on flag complexes There were two questions about $k$-decomposability and flag complexes that seemed natural, and that I didn't know the answer to. 

Any countable Borel equivalence relation can arise from a Borel action of the free group on $\omega$ generators, which is a natural enough group. You should probably ask instead whether the action can be natural. Can the action be free, for example, as Joel discusses. The field of countable Borel equivalence relations has gained a tremendous amount from studying equivalence relations arising from natural group actions. However, for the case of Turing equivalence, viewing this relation as arising from the Borel action of a countable group does not appear to be a helpful way of thinking. You might be interesting in the following open question (from my thesis). The question essentially asks whether the Turing reductions are the unique way to generate Turing equivalence: Suppose that $\{\psi_i\}_{i \in \omega}$ is any countable collection of partial Borel functions closed under composition such that $x$ and $y$ are Turing equivalent if and only if there exists an $i$ and a $j$ such that $\psi_i(x) = y$ and $\psi_j(y) = x$. Suppose also that $\{\varphi_i\}_{i \in \omega}$ is an enumeration of the Turing reductions. Then must there be a pointed perfect set $P$ and a function $u: \omega^2 \rightarrow \omega^2$ such that for every pair of Turing reductions $\varphi_i$ and $\varphi_j$, if $x,y \in P$ and $\varphi_i(x) = y$ and $\varphi_j(y) = x$, then $\psi_k(x) = y$ and $\psi_l(y) = x$, where $u(i,j) = (k,l)$? It is probably optimistic to hope that the answer to the above question is "yes", when we have no idea how to approach this problem. However, beyond the question being nice in and of itself, a positive answer would have a large number of consequences. It would imply Martin's conjecture on Turing invariant functions is true, for example, which in turn would have a lot of consequences for the theory of countable Borel equivalence relations. A positive answer would also imply any universal countable Borel equivalence relation must be able to witness its universality uniformly, regardless of the way it is generated. A nice implication of this would be that any increasing union of non-universal countable Borel equivalence relations must be non-universal. 

I have a heavily symmetric regular graph whose automorphisms I know. I remove one subgraph and insert another one in a consistent manner; for example, this could be a Delta-Y transformation (replacing a node with a complete subgraph). I'd like to compute the automorphisms of the new graph using the automorphisms of the old graph. I have the sense that this problem isn't too difficult, but am not sure how best to approach it and am new to algebraic graph theory. What are some good references or suggested starting points? 

Let P and Q be simple polytopes such that P = Q ∩ H and let H be a halfspace with normal vector n. Let projn(e) denote the length of the projection of edge e onto vector n. Consider the set E of edges of Q that cross through H, ie, edges with one endpoint in H and one outside H. For any e ∈ E, does there always exist a projective transformation φ of P such that for every f ∈ E, projφ(n)(φ(e)) ≥ projφ(n)(φ(f))? In other words, is there always a projective transformation making an arbitrary edge crossing H maximal with respect to H? My first approach would be to choose φ to extend the endpoint of e as far as possible, but this does not appear to be sufficient to guarantee that projφ(n)(φ(e)) is maximized without adjusting other edges of Q. 

Graph combinatorics is very different under AD to what we are used to under AC. For example, under AD there is an acyclic graph on $\mathbb{R}$ with no 2-coloring (indeed, no coloring with countably many colors). Hall's marriage theorem is also false, even in a very trivial case: there is a 2-regular bipartite graph on $\mathbb{R}$ with no perfect matching. These theorems both follow from the assertion that every set of reals has the Baire property, and the arguments can be found in Kechris-Solecki-Todorcevic's 1999 paper: Borel Chromatic Numbers. I also have a recent paper on descriptive combinatorics that directly uses the axiom of determinacy, and not just measure or category arguments. For example, I show that under AD, for every n, there is an acyclic n-regular graph on $\mathbb{R}$ with chromatic number n+1, and an acyclic bipartite n-regular graph with no perfect matching. The games I use are based on partitions of free products of countable groups into two pieces. 

There are a couple well known proofs of incompleteness based on properties of PA degrees. PA degrees have been studied extensively in recursion theory. A PA degree is a Turing degree that can compute a complete extension of PA. Obviously, to prove the incompleteness theorem, it's enough to show that no PA degree can be recursive. (If we had a consistent r.e. theory T extending PA that was not incomplete, then its completion would be recursive -- to decide whether $T \models \varphi$ or $T \models \neg \varphi$, simply look for a proof of $\varphi$ or $\neg \varphi$ from $T$, and because $T$ is assumed to be complete, this process always terminates and is hence recursive). One way to see that there are no recursive PA degrees is to observe that any PA degree can compute a nonstandard model of PA via compactness and a Henkin construction. Now apply Tennenbaum's theorem that there are no recursive nonstandard models of PA. Another way to see that there are no recursive PA degrees is with $\Pi^0_1$ classes. Every PA degree can compute a path through each $\Pi^0_1$ class (this is one direction of the Scott basis theorem). To finish, note that one can construct $\Pi^0_1$ classes that do not contain any recursive elements. For instance, there are $\Pi^0_1$ classes that contain only diagonally nonrecursive elements.
