Also, it was raining. Water, reduces grip. When you tried to brake with your rear brake, you had no weight on your back wheel, AND you had very little grip. THEREFORE, there was no friction (slippage). When you tried to brake with you front brake, you had ALL your weight on your front wheel, and very little grip. THEREFORE, MUCH MUCH MORE friction. Your BIKE (not you) slowed down. However, since your weight was already far forward on your bike. Your bike slowing down, causes you to be FURTHER forward on your bike. At some point, your bike stops, and you ... don't... By shifting your weight further back, you give yourself more time to react to your bike slowing down. You weight down your rear brake (giving it more friction/braking power). Put yourself in a better position to brace against your bike. 

In the end, each person must decide what they need and are willing to pay and whether a product provides benefits that they will appreciate. Don't jump to the assumption that other non-competitive riders are wasting their money on expensive crap, but also don't feel guilty if you don't notice or appreciate the difference in weight between two bikes. And if you end up doing longer or steeper rides, you can always change your mind later. 

This process might not be exactly the same for all tire models, but I've noticed it in several of them. Of course, even a new tire should be replaced if it develops any signs of trauma as discussed in other answers (bulges, cracks, or gashes), or if the frequency of punctures increases. 

You should shift your weight further back on your bike and brace against your handlebars when braking (especially when downhill). Now here is the science bit. Friction is limited by 

Just got back from a ride. On my way back, my rear tire suffered from a side wall blow out. The area that went looks like it has been completely shredded. The area feels like it's been melted, with sticky melty rubber covering it. The tire itself hasn't done 500km, I got it last summer, but haven't been able to ride much. There really shouldn't be any reason I know that the tire failed. The tires are Michelin Pro4. 

It sounds like you have your weight far too far forwards when braking. My reasoning comes from 3 things: 

On a ride yesterday, I noticed a spot on my shorts where the fabric felt rough. After washing, the problem became much worse, and there are major areas of damage on both the front and back of the shorts. The following picture shows a close-up of a section of the shorts on the front near the chamois. If I look at the shorts closely, it almost seems like there are short little threads of elastic sticking out. 

Bicycle chains with higher model numbers (and slightly higher prices) are often nickel-plated or half-nickel-plated. What are the benefits of nickel-plated chains over non-nickel-plated chains? How durable is the plating--does it wear off, or do its benefits last for the life of the chain? 

You can obviously avoid department store bikes by buying from reputable local bike shops, but how can you tell whether a used bike is a department store bike? Are there any telltale signs? I have a friend who is looking to buy a used bike, and I would like to tell him what to look out for. 

Your rear wheel skidded as soon as you applied a small amount of rear braking You flipped over the front as soon as you applied a small amount of front braking You were going downhill. 

You want to buy a Grid Tied Wind Inverter. These are pure sine-wave inverters that are designed to synchronize with a power grid and feed directly into you home's power distribution system. However, you should note, that these devices typically require permits to run; as a poorly maintained/designed system has a very high potential to electrocute power company engineers (they expect that the power line will be safe after they isolate it from the grid, not expecting you to own a small generator at home). Once you receive all your permits required, you can just hook up your bike to a small DC motor/generator and the inverter. Everything should work very simply. You should be able to get one of these inverters for about USD150 these days. $URL$ 

As far as I understand, the cycling term "domestique" (referring to a supporting member of a professional cycling team) comes from the French word for "servant". According to Wikipedia, it was first used in cycling as an insult: "He is unworthy. He is no more than a domestique." Is the cycling term "domestique" still pejorative? What are its connotations in modern cycling? Do racers refer to themselves as domestiques, or would they prefer to be called something else? 

Different hues of lenses have been well covered in existing answers, but light transmission hasn't been directly addressed. Lenses are characterized by how much visible light is transmitted through them. A dark lens has low light transmission, and a clear lens has high light transmission. Clear Lenses Most clear safety lenses have light transmission in the 75% to 95% range. Lenses in the 75% range appear to be clear, but if you put them on, they reduce brightness by a small but noticeable amount. As Benzo mentioned, clear lenses provide physical protection and filter ultraviolet light, even though they don't filter much visible light. Sunglasses Most sunglasses have lenses with light transmission in the 10% to 15% range, with some wavelengths filtered more aggressively than others. Other answers cover the usefulness of different colors. Photochromic Sunglasses Photochromic (a.k.a. photochromatic or transitions) lenses vary light transmission in response to ultraviolet light: $URL$ Most have light transmission of about 10% or 20% in bright conditions and about 50% in dark conditions. Note that photochromic lenses darken in response to cold temperatures. Also, they don't darken in cars since windshields filter ultraviolet light. Low-Light Photochromic Sunglasses Some photochromic lenses are designed for low light and have 75% light transmission (almost clear) in dark conditions. However, low light photochromic lenses have 20% or 25% light transmission in bright conditions and don't get as dark as ordinary sunglasses. 

Use should use anything EXCEPT the bell. Here is another case where legislation has not caught up with scientific reasoning. In many countries the bell is a mandatory piece of equipment, which leads many to believe in its efficacy in increasing safety. The bell actually lowers safety. A typical bell rings with a very pure tone. The result of which is that a bell typically has a long coherence length. This means that sound changes very little with respect to time and space. When the tone does not change very much with respect to space, both ears will hear exactly the same thing. This makes it very difficult for the brain to pin point the direction and range of a bell. This should be evident with any cyclist who has seen pedestrians who actually DO hear the bell, but fail to locate the source in the time it takes to close in to the pedestrian. Another example of the phenomenon is when you try to locate the source of electronic buzzing. No matter how annoyingly loud it is, it is extremely hard to locate. This is because electronics buzz at a very precise 50/60Hz of your local electricity company. In UK, emergency services now employ brief spurts of white noise as part of their sirens, specifically because white noise has a very short coherence length. The result is that many people do not hear the bell because their subconscious filters it out because it does not immediately recognize that the information is directed at them. Use anything with a shorter coherence length than a bell My advise is to employ any sort of sound generation equipment that has a shorter coherence length than a bell. Typically anything mechanical will have short coherence length (changes sound often). Systems that work effectively
