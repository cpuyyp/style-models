It seems that your indications regarding changing conditions following sea level rise are valid. Rising base level will move the current depositional processes inland some distance as you have indicated. The process will apply basically in the same way to all rivers that terminate in a body of water that will be affected by sea level rise, for example rivers that terminate in a lake that will not rise due to the changing climate will not be affected. There are some circumstances where lakes in steep terrain could be affected by increased meltwater from surrounding glaciers, and that increase could be significant, but the models predicting sea level rise are not referring to particular local conditions, which are on a case by case basis, but possibly very important to the local populations. Where the process becomes interesting is what happens to a particular river, because they will all be different. In order to determine what will likely happen, one must consider the physical aspects of the river, what is the change in elevation near the terminus, what is the topography of the floodplain, how much does the river meander as it approaches the terminus? These and other similar factors will determine what happens as the base level rises. If you consider a river that has very little change in elevation, and meanders across a wide floodplain, the amount of inundation caused by a one meter rise in base level will cover a large area of what is now floodplain and likely intermittently wet or dry based on seasonal fluctuations. Compare this with a river that occupies a canyon, or is deeply incised and has a steep gradient to the base level, the base level will rise within those constraining features and little will likely happen to the narrow floodplain that has been present. First step for your inquiry about the Rhine River is to look at the topography surrounding the river, and mark out a one meter change in the area surrounding the river beginning from the terminus, as the terrain becomes steeper toward the head water the change from current condition will diminish. Direct answer to your question is that the inland affect of one meter of base level rise could reach much farther than one meter upstream depending on the topographical features near the river terminus, and each river will be different. 

Short answer is that no this is not normal, which is why there are experts descending on the area to study the situation. Your first theory is not likely to be an issue, as oil is produced from a well, the fluids from the surrounding area move into the now available space which leaves the subsurface in a situation that isn't terribly dissimilar to what had been. The oil is produced from tiny spaces in a rock supported matrix and fluid remains present after production, this has some effect but not typically significant, either water will intrude to fill the space, or the reduced pressure will allow gas to expand and fill the space, but the rock matrix provides the support. Injection of fluids can have a significant effect though, the point of pressure from the injection changes the dynamics of the rocks that are taking on the fluid, which must be injected with enough force to overcome the fluid pressure present in the rocks and induce flow through the pore spaces. The injection could be managed so that the pressures used are just slightly above what is necessary to induce flow, but those flow rates would be very low compared to what is desirable for waste disposal, so higher pressure is used, which can trigger seismic events. Hydraulic fracturing takes this even further, using very high pressure and large volumes of fluids to induce new open flow paths in the rocks, and this certainly has some effect, and can trigger seismic events. Imagine that you have two large blocks of rock that want to slide past each other but are holding the tension without moving, and then someone injects a lubricant that reduces the friction between the two, the friction is reduced to the point that motion will occur. 

I own the Second edition, 2005 reissue of this textbook, purchased through Amazon in August 2009. After p308, my copy has only one more page of content (p309), which is the last page of the Index. You indeed have a faulty copy. I recommend you send it back for replacement again and request them to inspect the copy before shipping. If you are still unlucky with the second replacement, I would try e-mailing the publisher with your purchase invoice and request a pdf of the book which would complement your hardcopy with the missing page. 

Operationally, cloud cover is determined subjectively by visual contact with the sky from the human observer (meteorologist on duty). No instruments or objective measures are used, so the two measures cannot be related in an obvious way. The unit used to describe cloud cover is called Okta, and ranges from 0 (sky completely clear) to 8 (full cover). Each value has a graphical representation which can be included on synoptic weather maps for each station. Another important reason why cloud cover cannot be unambiguously related to illuminance is explained in detail in Casey's answer - different types of clouds and cloud depths may lead to different illuminance values for same values of cloud cover.

The short answer is no. Tropical cyclones (TC) develop and persist in conditions favorable to them: 1) Low Coriolis parameter $f = 2\Omega \sin{\theta}$, where $\Omega$ is the angular velocity of Earth and $\theta$ is latitude. If $f$ is small, the centripetal force balances the pressure gradient force in the gradient wind balance, and the radius of curvature becomes small. While this is one of the reasons why TCs form in the tropics, that still does not prevent the storm to move North and re-curve into Western Europe or Northern California. This limits the latitude extent of the region of TC genesis to approximately 5-30 N (or S). This factor is most certain and not subject to climate change. 2) TCs get the energy from sensible and latent heat fluxes at the surface. Thus, they form over the ocean and it needs to be warm. Historically popular threshold of sea surface temperature (SST) necessary for a TC to develop was 26$^{\circ}$C. Nowadays, we know that this is not enough - TCs need a significant thickness of the upper ocean to be warm in order to get enough heat to be sustainable. Another reason why the ocean is more favorable for TCs than land is surface friction - the air flow over the ocean surface is typically much more aerodynamically smooth compared to over land. Low wind stress and high heat fluxes are key. Though the wind stress is not going to change, heat fluxes may increase if the ocean heat content in the tropics increases (for example, by weakening of the Meridional Overturning Circulation). 3) TCs also need favorable atmospheric conditions in their environment - namely, high humidity (water vapor content) in the environmental air, and low wind shear (difference between wind in the upper and lower troposphere) facilitate TC genesis and longer life. These factors are, in my opinion, least understood of the three, especially in terms of their contribution to the vortex dynamics and vortex-mean flow interaction. This aspect is more likely to be subject to climate change compared to the others. All this being said, we may see a change in the occurrence frequency of TCs in the future, and/or a change in the distribution of the extreme weather events. However, the mechanisms in the climate that would lead to this change are still not well understood. It is unlikely though that the TCs will start forming in new regions around the world.
