There is a useful notion of a proper map $f: X \to Y$. The definition is that $f$ is proper if for all spaces $Z$ the map $f \times 1_Z: X \times Z \to Y \times Z$ is a closed map. This notion comes I think from Bourbaki. You can find it on p. 90 of my book "Topology and groupoids" (2006). The first result on this is that if $f$ is a closed map such that $f^{-1}(y)$ is compact for all $y \in Y$, then $f$ is proper. The Exercises to that Section contain quite a few further results on proper maps. You should quickly be able to prove in your question that if the $f_i$ are all proper, then so is $f$, and hence $f$ is closed. 

I feel it would be difficult to deal with non locally path connected spaces and covering spaces, though I may be wrong. However the existence of a covering map $f: X \to Y$ implies certain local conditions on $Y$; these are usually stated in the case $f$ is a universal cover, but the more general case is in Chapter 10 of Topology and Groupoids, Section 5, as that $Y$ is "semilocally $\chi_f$-connected", which means that each point $y \in Y$ has a neighbourhood $U$ such that for all $x \in X$ with $f(x)=y$ the image of $\pi_1(U,y)$ in $\pi_1(Y,y)$ is contained in the image under $f$ of $\pi_1(X,x)$. So to get a lift of $p: Z \to Y$ to all possible base points you seem to need a similar condition on $Z$ and $p$. The proofs in above the book go by modelling covering maps of spaces by covering morphisms of groupoids. This modelling seems to me particularly convenient, as against the usual modelling in terms of actions of groups, when considering lifting of maps. 

Edit October 2013: I have given more information on the Blakers-Massey triad theorem on the ncatlab here, referring specifically to the algebraic determination of the critical, i.e. first non vanishing, group. This is described as a tensor product of relative homotopy groups, and of course a tensor product is trivial if one of the factors is trivial. So we get an intuitive view of the connectivity result and so for the Freudenthal Suspension Theorem. Indeed, they are both seen as a consequence of a higher order homotopy Seifert-van Kampen Theorem. Original answer: John Klein's answer refers to the Blakers-Massey triad theorem; this was generalised to an $n$-ad connectivity theorem by Barratt and Whitehead, and of which Goodwillie has given a geometric proof, using general position arguments. In these results there is interest in describing the critical group, an $n$-ad homotopy group, which may be nonabelian in general. Some abelian cases have been described by Barratt and Whitehead, following Blakers-Massey, with simple connectivity assumptions. This problem was solved in Theorem 3.7 of Ellis, G.J. and Steiner, R. "Higher-dimensional crossed modules and the homotopy groups of $(n+1)$-ads." J. Pure Appl. Algebra 46 (2-3) (1987) 117--136. which uses crucially the van Kampen Theorem for $n$-cubes of spaces in Brown, R. and Loday, J.-L. "Van Kampen theorems for diagrams of spaces", Topology 26~(3) (1987) 311--335. With an appendix by M. Zisman. Of course connectivity results follow from the algebraic results, but the proof in this last paper is by induction with connectivity in one dimension implying surjectivity in the next. One intuitive point is that the description of the critical group of an $n$-ad will involve generalised Whitehead products coming from sub $r$- and $s$-ads of the given $n$-ad, and an elaborate algebra (crossed $n$-cubes of groups, as defined by Ellis-Steiner) is needed to handle all this. The proofs do not involve general position at all. For a fairly recent application of these ideas, see Ellis, G.~J. and Mikhailov, R. "A colimit of classifying spaces". Advances in Math. (2010) arXiv: [math.GR] 0804.3581v1. 

Another answer to your interest in analogues between groups and Lie algebras is in Ellis, Graham J. Nonabelian exterior products of Lie algebras and an exact sequence in the homology of Lie algebras. J. Pure Appl. Algebra 46 (1987), no. 2-3, 111–115. which gives $H_2(L)$ for a Lie algebra as the kernel of a morphism $L \wedge L \to L$ where $L \wedge L$ is a nonabelian exterior product. This is the Lie algebra analogue of a result for groups proved in Miller, Clair, `The second homology of a group', Proc. American Math. Soc. 3 (1952) 588-595. This is part of the development of nonabelian tensor products of groups (and Lie algebras). More references to this are in the bibliography $URL$ @Jim Stasheff Sept 21, 2016 In a belated answer to Jim's question, there is a "nonabelian tensor product" $G \otimes H$ of groups which act on each other "compatibly", of which an example is when $G,H$ are normal subgroups of a group $Q$: in that case there is a commutator map $[\;,\;]: H \times H \to Q$ with properties for $[gg',h], [g,hh']$ which make it what is called a biderivation. The universal object for biderivations is written $G \otimes H$, and the commutator map then determines a morphism $\kappa: G \otimes H \to Q$ with image $[G,H]$. The kernel of $G \otimes G \to G$ is actually isomorphic to $\pi_3(SK(G,1))$. There are analogues for Lie Algebras. 

Another possible direction on the fundamental group(oid) is given a kind of survey in my paper `Three themes in the work of Charles Ehresmann: Local-to-global; Groupoids; Higher dimensions', Proceedings of the 7th Conference on the Geometry and Topology of Manifolds: The Mathematical Legacy of Charles Ehresmann, Bedlewo (Poland) 8.05.2005-15.05.2005, Banach Centre Publications 76, Institute of Mathematics Polish Academy of Sciences, Warsaw, (2007) 51-63. (math.DG/0602499). relating to the themes of monodromy and holonomy, and work of Jean Pradines. Here one is interested in the notion of an "iteration of local procedures" in the context of manifold theory. The question put in that paper is: Can one use these ideas in other situations to obtain monodromy (i.e. analogues of "universal covers") in situations where paths do not exist but "iterations of local procedures" do? This seems related to Valerio's question. 

You could look at the paper Mackey, George W. Ergodic theory and virtual groups. Math. Ann. 166 1966 187–207. which ends up by discussing the notion of ergodic groupoid, andfollow this up with the citations of this paper. The intuitive idea is that while a transitive action of a group corresponds to a subgroup, then what does an ergodic action, correspond to? His theory went through various stages, and ended up with the notion of ergodic groupoid. This introduction of groupoids into analysis is part of the historical background to Noncommutative geometry! Mackey told me of this work in 1967, and made me realise that there was more in groupoids than I had then thought; the idea did not come just from algebraic topology. Of course groupoid theory is not the same as category theory, but is in that direction. At least, people who liked category theory found it easy to be happy with groupoids. 

I think you should look at MR2342857 (2008i:58016) Pradines, Jean In Ehresmann's footsteps: from group geometries to groupoid geometries. (English summary) Geometry and topology of manifolds, 87–157, Banach Center Publ., 76, Polish Acad. Sci., Warsaw, 2007. (arXiv:0711.1608 ) which discusses these issues.

It is useful to consider this construction in more generality, as is well written up in the case of groupoids (see Higgins' book "Categories and groupoids"). Let $C$ be a small category, and $f: Ob(C) \to Y$ a function. Then there is a category $f_*(C)$ with object set $Y$ and satisfying a universal property with regard to functors on $C$ whose object function factors through $f$. If $C,D$ are two categories with base points, then you get the free product by taking the disjoint union of $C$ and $D$ and then identifying the base points. To put this in a more general light, the objects of a (small) category can be regarded as a functor Ob from the category $\mathsf{Cat}$ of small categories and functors to the category $\mathsf{Set}$ of sets and functions, and then this functor Ob is both a fibration (this is about pullbacks) and cofibration (this is about pushouts). There is a basic account of these ideas, which originated with Grothendieck, in R. Brown and R. Sivera, `Algebraic colimit calculations in homotopy theory using fibred and cofibred categories',  Theory and Applications of Categories, 22 (2009) 222-251. 

This answer relates mainly to the term "Higher refinement of Seifert-van Kampen Theorem", rather than homotopy colimit. Last week I gave a talk to the 2015 Category Theory Meeting in Aveiro, entitled "A philosophy of modelling and computing homotopy types". The Abstract and full and handout versions (slightly refined) are available on my preprint page. Homotopy colimits enter from the side in order to get a "nice" pushout of spaces, but the aim is explicit nonabelian pushout computations of certain **homotopy types. It is often hard work to compute from this homotopy groups and $k$-invariants! (There was also no time for indications in the talk.) I do not know of an account of a homotopy theory, and so of "homotopy colimits", for the crossed squares used in this presentation for modelling, and some computations of, homotopy $3$-types. Later: I'll add that in 1965 I found the nice statement and proof for the fundamental groupoid $\pi_1(X)$ of a space which was a union of open sets. I thought: great! One can get rid of base points! Then I found this was not enough for my first aim, getting as a Corollary the fundamental group of the circle. So then I discovered the applications of the fundamental groupoid $\pi_1(X,A)$ on a set $A$ of base points, chosen according to the geometry of the given situation. In particular, the determination of the fundamental group of the circle required at least $2$ base points. These results were published in 1967. This simple extension of the theorem and proof of the usual van Kampen theorem is, to my knowledge, given in topology texts in English only in the 1968, 1988, 2006 editions of what is now titled "Topology and Groupoids". As for higher versions of the nonabelian fundamental group, these were sought by the topologists of the early 20th century topologists (Dehn, Cech, Hopf, ...) but I think did require for the proof a shift from groups to groupoids, and a 2-dim Seifert-van Kampen Theorem was published by Philip Higgins and I in 1978. That was a theorem on second relative homotopy groups. June 24: The updated Abstract of the Aveiro presentation is as follows, and I hope shows some special features of this approach to Higher Seifert-van Kampen Theorems: ABSTRACT This philosophy involves functors $\mathbb H$ from (Topological Data) to (Algebraic Data), and conversely "classifying space" functors $ \mathbb B$ from (Algebraic Data) to (Topological Data). These should satisfy:
