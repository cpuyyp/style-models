One thing which I do believe would be good for you is to try to understand your friend's position. You don't have to agree, but just understand. His stance is along the lines of a very classic one: he has found that there are no mappings life "life X is better than life Y" which benefit him besides "I want my life more than I want anyone else's life." He rejects those other mappings and simply acts without them. The reason I recommend understanding your friend's position is because it has been found to be a very useful position through history. Forces like jealousy drive you forward because they all drive together into a powerful force: "I want something." If you want something, you can aspire towards it. "Want" is powerful, with immense positives and negatives. It drives much of society. You will craft your "wants" throughout your life. Your friend's position is one of "no want." He isn't looking to change, he isn't aspiring to something (at least his words say so... leave it to him to decide if he is actually aspiring or not). "No want" is also powerful, with immense positives and negatives. If you understand both of them, you can use both at your leisure. While your jealousy does you good, you keep it. When it stops working for you (and many religious philosophers would say it surly will), you can discard it because you understand the other side of the coin. When "no want" fails you (and much of Western society would say it surly will), you can pick up wants, because you are now aware of both options. 

Your argument begs the conclusion. You cannot state that the hypothesis can never be false because the model proves it can never be false until you accept the model. Given that model is the thing under test, you have no reason to assume its proofs are true. The more interesting issue is the challenge of developing meaningful empirical experiments. At some point, as with all science, you're going to have to declare that the evidence you gathered is empirically sufficient to "prove" the model is correct. Designing an experiment to test something which does a good job of predicting what experiments you are going to want to run is a bit disconcerting. The issues with Godel are also fascinating, but they only apply if you have a system which can mathematically prove its own correctness. If you are not relying on mathematical correctness, and instead are only relying on empirical validation, you can sidestep his issues. 

What is intuitive for one person is not always intuitive for another, so permit me to make a guess at what you consider to be "intuition," and we'll see how close I am. Much of philosophy, and indeed all of learning, is tied up in symbols words and phrases, and the manipulation thereof. Linguistically we call these the "syntax" of our language. Syntax describes what the symbols are and how they are allowed to be manipulated. This is contrasted with semantics, which is the study of the meaning of these symbols. Sometimes we just understand the manipulation of these symbols at an intuitive level. For instance, most of us on this site can manipulate English nouns to make them plural at an intuitive level. We rarely think "The plural of 'cat' is 'cats' because most plural nouns are a concatenation of the singular noun plus the letter 's'." That statement is true, but most of us would simply say "The plural of 'cat' is 'cats'" because one cat is a "cat" and two or more cats is "cats." We have some intuitive sense of what it means to have many of something, and we intuitively understand what the correct word for it is. This works great until you come across a word like "octopus," whose plural is not obvious (some say "octopi," others say "octopuses," others say "octopodes"). That's when we break out the "rules of grammar" and point out that "octopus" actually borrows from the Greek "oktopous," not Latin, so it should not be given the 2nd declension nominative plural ending. But what just happened there? I suddenly shifted gears and started talking about syntax -- the construction of 2nd declension nouns in Latin. In Latin, singular nouns ending in -us are 2nd declension nouns, and the nominative plural of those end in -i. What I just described was syntactical. You don't have to know what it means for something to be in the 2nd declension. You don't have to know that the 2nd declension is most commonly used for masculine things. You can simply apply the rule. This is where I think my linguistic argument starts to tie into your concept of "intuition." You aren't looking for the syntax of logic, you're looking for the semantics of it. You're looking for the meaning of the symbol, not the syntactic manipulations that are allowed around it. And therein lies the rub which virmaior wrote to. The meaning of is . Its a definition of the language. It has no deeper meaning, any more than the made up word "blartlfilthygong" has a deeper meaning. But there's a bit more to it. Individual people do apply meaning to . And it has generally been found that philosophers who are aware of the definition of it as generally come to agree on the meaning of enough for that symbol to facilitate communication. Accordingly, what I believe you are after is two things: 

The single most important thing I have found to improving that skill is to realize that you should not be deciding whether something is relevant or irrelevant. You should be trying to improve your skill at determining the relevancy of a thing. The former wording implies a binary classification, when the reality is that relevancy is much more continuous than that. The next best skill is finding ways to do something such that its value is not dependent on its relevancy to a given topic. Find ways to make sure that, after you're done with a book or a topic that it will be applicable, even in ways you might not have thought of when you started. That is where I find philosophy valuable. The idea of knowing whether something will have value before you know what it is can be an alien concept under many worldviews. Philosophy is an excellent tool for unsettling worldviews and allowing them to change. It's also an excellent tool for helping one find value in the subtle things that many people ignore. The more subtle things you can find value in, the easier it is to make sure you get value out of whatever act or book you are exploring, relevant or irrelevant. 

You would have to prove that B is prime before the inconsistency appears (It happens to be prime!) I give that example as a finite case, because finite cases are easier to follow. There are systems where the inconsistency appears as you start dealing with infinity. They are even nastier, but much harder to follow. 

No. Biological data is merely data. It requires an interpretation. To show A's superiority over B, we must define a metric upon which we can declare A=B, or A>B. It is trivial to define metrics which show humans to be superior to animals, and it is trivial to define metrics which show humans to not be superior to animals. The choice of metric is not founded in biology, it's founded in what we believe being superior means. It should not be surprising to find that humans find "superior" means doing human like things! As an example of where such metrics get complicated, a human is typically viewed as superior to an ant. However, it is less clear if humankind is superior to antkind, because suddenly the ants get to leverage their massive numbers to make the metrics look bigger. If we're not careful, "inanimate" things can score higher than us. For possibilities of actions, the great ball of fusion in the sky above us is capable of more possible actions than all of us (measured using potential quantum states as a metric for possibilities), thanks to its enormous mass! It just goes to show how tricky defining such metrics can be. 

The phrasing "we call" invokes linguistic concepts akin to the work of Tarski. "'P' is true if and only if P is true" is the phrasing of his famous definition of Tarskian Truth, and the single quotes call attention to the idea that, while P may be a real thing, 'P' is a linguistic phrasing or concept. The argument here may be that there is a deep thing that is not quantitative, which is related to the thing we call "consciousness," but that "consciousness" is just a word, to which we can attempt to apply a definition. It is entirely possible that the thing we call consciousness is something which necessarily entails a particular level of nervous complexity. However, it is also possible that there is something deeper than that which is not intimately entwined with neurophysiology. If that something was given a name, it might be remarkably hard to distinguish from "consciousness," and thus there would be little value in trying to give it any name besides "consciousness." If one does make the argument that what we call consciousness necessitates some neural arrangement, this may lead us to distinguish between the neural arrangements and that something deeper that was previously hard to see. Linguistically, one of two results can easily happen: 

The concept of "an observer" does not appear within QM, but on its borders. In fact, it is better thought of not as the edge of QM, but rather the edge of classical mechanics. It is the concept of how classical mechanics can observe behaviors which are too coherent to otherwise explain with classical means. The Observer Effect is not well defined, because it hasn't been worth anyone's time to define the exact behavior, but it is generally accepted as a pattern where the interaction with non-coherent particles from outside the system cause the waveform to "collapse" to a stable value which is classically measurable. By this definition, one could define entanglement as being remarkably close to the observer effect. You take two particles which are decoherent, and act on them to cause them to cohere. You could argue that one particle ends up "observing" the state of the other. However, I find most interpretations of the observer effect rely on the Central Limit Theorem. Since the distributions are finitary both in mean and variance, repeated bombardment of a system with "observer" particles will eventually generate a normal distribution curve which can be measured. However, the rules of statistics break down around N=1, so whether you consider a single particle to be an observer is really a matter of personal judgement. 

It seems that the second law of thermodynamics holds. We haven't seen any evidence against it, but we've never come across a system which is perfectly in equilibrium. It seems like a water droplet flies through the air, it will have a minimal surface area. However, in practice this is not true. The droplet will always be oscillating with a little energy. That energy approaches 0 as damping effects reduce it, but the perfect water droplet shape is a limit, not something actually achieved. It seems like things fall to the ground in a straight line, but we know that's just a statistical gimick. The object is being battered left and right by air molecules and actually takes a wobbly path that's really close to straight, at least when viewed by our eyes. It seems you have taken your observations about what seems to be true and come to the conclusion that these things are true. Thus it seems the universe is a hypocrite only because you seem to believe it to be true. We may simply not yet have written down the perfect laws to describe the universe. Or perhaps they cannot be written. It seems to me the universe may just be spiting you ;-) 

I think one cannot talk about this topic without at least arguing that one major reason monotheism is considered to be a cultural milestone is because many of those who are declaring cultural milestones are part of cultures that support monotheism. There is a well documented pattern in human thought that lends us to believe that what we are doing is superior to all others. To that point, I would venture a guess that the individual who suggested one reason monotheism was a cultural milestone was because "it was one step closer to atheism" was in all likelihood an atheist. One major advantage 0 or 1 gods has over more is the lack of unlimited conflict. Typically the powers of gods are seen as substantially greater than that of mankind. While we can often reconcile the will of a single god with the physical world we perceive, or reconcile it with the will of many gods who are "playing nice" with each other, conflict between gods is something typically above and beyond that of the mortals. Consider that, in a conflict between people, we typically assume that neither individual really has full control over the situation. We accept that there are some consequences of that conflict which will arise that were not truly willed by either individual. Conceptually, a conflict between gods would have similar effects, but with sweeping implications. Polytheism offers the opportunity for people to blame things they don't want to change on something completely out of anyone's control, simply by blaming it on a conflict between the gods. This would be different than blaming a single god (one of the pantheon or a monotheistic god) in that in the former case the event may not have been willed by either god, but in the latter its presumed that the god indeed willed things to happen. Without defending any one religion or style of religion, I cannot say whether monotheism is a "milestone" or not. However, there is certainly something to be said for a religion which holds its deity responsible for its actions. Ensuring a religion does so is easier if they are monotheistic. If they are polytheistic, one would need to take action to make sure they don't blame conflict for things which should instead reflect on their religion. If these traits are desirable, then it would be reasonable to call it a "milestone." 

So, in all, the answer is "it depends," as always. However, in most environments there is some room for a gradient. 

I think you might be able to make an argument "we create because we are conscious, and creation makes it easier to think." 

Because you can always intersect something with True without changing its value. I can then substitute one true expression(2) for another true expression (T) because they both have the same truth value 

I'm one of those people who makes arguments like that, so I can at least give you some of the points of view I am sometimes using (when they suit me). One easy thing to point out is that "the belief everything is relative" is only self-refuting if you believe as such. Consider that someone who could say such a thing must surely suggest that language itself is relative. Maybe the word "everything" doesn't mean the same thing to you as it does to me. Or maybe "is" means something slightly different. It's trivial to make such claims consistent if you do not presume too many things about the language you are speaking in, although you typically pay for such consistency in other ways (such as being unable to prove anything). Is it worth it? It depends. Sometimes its nice to remind the other person of some fundamentals of linguistics which most students of linguistics know, but we often forget in day to day life. Another reason is that not everybody presumes "truth" is the highest calling. Some value "good" independent of truth, and permit them to mix in ways that they find beneficial, but you may find distasteful. Even if we start from the assumption that your interpretation of "the belief everything is relative" is correct, they still might suggest it because they see an opportunity for good which comes at the cost of saying something which, from their perspective, is ever so slightly not true. It's far more kind than the average white lie that we accept in much of our life -- it's so kind that it even stares you straight in the face and says "you can reject this idea, simply by believing it is paradoxical." Many white lies can take a lifetime to root out. If they believe they can help you by issuing such an utterance in an argument, is it not reasonable that they may try? I'll save the reasons you'll probably feel most comfortable with last: defenses. We live in a culture where if you admit something is true, you are automatically obligated by everyone around you to hold to that truth. They are even allowed to call you out, saying, "You believe A, but you are doing B which is not consistent with a belief in A." For someone who "believes everything is relative," the last few absolutes in their life are particularly fragile. They've intentionally jettisoned all of the easy ones. Accordingly, if you try to pin them in a corner with challenges like the one you describe in your question, many will defend it (or, sadly, they may have jettisoned one that they wish they'd kept, and they are reliant on your interaction to resolve the loss). I find the "best" do not find the need to defend in such way, because they have found something else that lets them deflect such challenges, but I will not claim to be such a person at this time. It's also rather kind for offense. Consider for a moment, Godel's Incompleteness Theorems and Tarski's Nondefinability theorem. Within the careful confines of math, they demonstrate limitations that must exist. These are wonderfully powerful tools to win arguments, but they only work in the world of pure math. Unless I can convince you to build an argument in a formal language, Tarski's theorem isn't going to help, and Godel wont come to my rescue until your argument encompasses all of arithmetic. However, if I have a hunch that what you are describing will clarify into one of these mathematical holes, I may choose to use an odd phrasing like "everything is relative" as an act of kindness. Sure, I could sit with you, going back and forth, nailing down the exact beliefs in question into carefully structured wordings. But if I do so, and then crush it with one of those mathematical arguments, you are left with nothing. If I instead go with "everything is relative," and smile, you can take whatever part of the discussion you want, and associate the rest with me being "one of those annoying relativists." You can adapt your beliefs (relative or absolute, as you please), and maybe we will find no debate necessary when we meet again. Of course, the belief that everything is relative has similar behaviors to other beliefs, such as those of religions and those of hard atheists. These beliefs can be used in ways which help our fellow man or woman, or they may be used in a way which puts others down. The big difference I see between those claiming "everything is relative" and beliefs such as major religions is that the major religions have more to lose, so they are quicker to encourage their members towards powerful ideals such as the golden rule. Extreme skeptics are not in the same position, so they have had less incentive to adopt such policies.
