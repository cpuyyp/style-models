As steed says, goal setting is one of the keys. One of the other things that I've found to develop that inner confidence is competition. Doesn't matter what kind, and in fact, the more varied the better. Doesn't necessarily have to be physical competition, mental and business lend themselves to the same structure in different ways. When you are just working out, even if you push yourself, you may not always face the same adversities as you would during a competition. Plus, there is a certain immediacy to competition that promotes the ability to think on your feet, adapt to changing situations, fluid thinking, etc. Team sports will generate one dynamic and way of thinking, individual sports another. You can develop leadership skills while in a team situation, as well as being able to excel within a role for the good of the team. Individual sports give you a chance to test your self reliance and adaptability. Even if you don't win, do horribly, do average, you should always be able to learn something about yourself every time you do a workout or enter a competition. It's the accumulation of all of this over many many repetitions that gives someone that confidence in themselves, and points out places that you may need to work on for greater confidence. 

Your bones are primarily responsible for storing calcium and phosphorous. Almost 100% of the stored calcium in your body is in your bones, and somewhere around 85% of the phosphorous is stored there. When you have deficiencies in your diet in these minerals, then the body releases hormones that cause the bones to give up their calcium for use elsewhere in the body. Over time, if the deficiency persists, then you start getting problems, such as rickets (soft bones caused by a deficiency in Vitamin D, calcium and/or phosphorous. As an aside, sailors away from fresh fruit used to get this quite often, so the British started using limes to combat this. Hence the term "Limeys" for British people). Fruits, vegetables and fortified milk are good sources to replenish this. And, as has been pointed out already, you are probably also deficient in protein intake to some extent, as you appear not to eat even a normal RDA, as opposed to an athletes need, but without a detailed diet list that would be hard to assess. 

Lactic Acid: The burning soreness that people refer to is caused by lactic acid buildup as a byproduct of ATP energy breakdown in the muscle cells. The circulatory system cleans the acid out as quickly as it can but just because lactic acid is no longer present, it doesn't necessarily mean that the muscle has recovered. Strength or Anaerobic: Soreness can also be caused by micro tears in the muscle fiber, affectionately referred to as ripping by body builders. These micro tears are also called Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness (DOMS). For people accustomed to lifting, they might not notice this as much as others by the time the lactic acid has been cleared out. For people who are new to exercise, on the other hand, they may find it hard to tell the difference between lactic acid, muscle tears, or even crams and spasms. Age is also a factor to consider with DOMS and muscle recovery. Quote From this article: 

In short, for the question of preventing injury, it's entirely relative to one's current fitness, nutrition, age, and current physical status. There is never a guarantee that stretching and warming up will prevent injury. The point of warming up is to limit the likelihood. For example: if one in relatively good shape and is relatively young and have no physical limitation such as a leg cramp, then in the cases you mentioned the risk of injury, in exercising with out warm-up, is relatively low. Conversely, in the other extreme, if one is relatively old, over weight, never works out, eats unhealthy, and currently has a leg cramp, then injury would be highly likely to occur. In both cases, however, injury is neither guaranteed to occur or not occur. Sorry the answer is not definite but in this case one cannot speak in absolutes. That said, Yes, it would be helpful in preventing injury to increase your fitness in a given activity in spontaneous things like running short distances before engaging in them to better condition your body. Spontaneous efforts will, at first, engage the fast twitch muscles so you'll also want to add a strength training regiment. Strength training will benefit you most for explosive efforts. If your ultimate goal is simply to do it with less hard breathing and sweating then cardio/pulmonary workouts [i.e. exercises that strengthen the lungs and heart] can increase lung and heart efficiency. Strength training is great for your heart but does little for lung endurance. This is where HIIT may become useful. As for sweating though, arguably, if you have to exert less efforts to receive same benefit then your body will need to sweat less but, at the same time, the more fit you are, the more easily you will sweat. See this article.. Other factors come into play as well such as ambient temperature, hydration, etc. For the issue of sweating, you can wear clothes that well breathe well and dissipate the sweat. HIIT is great for the lungs and heart but it is not a replacement for strength training and will not produce the same results in the short term or even long term. HIIT is the perfect method for losing fat while retaining muscle mass. It is also a good way to train for spontaneous activities especially if you also desire to burn calories. Some people define HIIT differently, so I'll add this qualifier Weight training being -i.e. weighted squats, leg press, calf extensions, lunges, etc. and HIT being non-weighted High Intensity Workouts. Some HIIT techniques involve weighted exercise but they're applied with a different methodology. The focus with HIIT is to burn calories not to build muscle strength. One of the drawbacks of HIIT is that many of it's activities may put you at risk of injury. If you're concerned about injury or have had a recent injury, I wouldn't recommend HIIT. More on why HIIT is not a replacement for strength training: 

Cardio is cardio. There are benefits and detriments to all of them, and what it basically boils down to is your own personal choice. Can running be a good replacement for swimming? Sure. There is different equipment costs (Good running shoes in the US run $125-200 US per pair, with a life of 3-400 miles usually), and there are different body strains (More impact, different muscles utilized), but your cardio system gets worked out. What it boils down to, is finding something that you enjoy and can do every day. If running is a chore, you will soon stop doing it. Enjoy it, and you will do it more often and get more out of it. Try a bunch of different stuff, find one or two (or even three) things you like to do and do them. You could run on day one, bike on day three, go rowing day four, etc. 

It is a training tool, it's just not the ultimate tool that the website claims it to be. I've used it mostly for work on grip strength and forearm stabilization. Use it at a high speed, with a wide fingered grip to promote the grip strength, and rotate the forearm around the "axis". Also you can flex/extend the wrist to work on the forearm. I've used it to increase grip strength for sword form competitions, and it's a minor tool but it can be useful. 

Conclusion: Bone minerilaztion/density increases with any stress placed on the bone including working out. Human Growth Hormone (HGH) and other hormones will help to facilitate this as long as there is simulation by mechanotransduction. Osteocytes are the cells responsible for this and have an average lifespan of 30 years so bone minerilaztion will decrease with age. Bone size can and will increase as well. This is heavily dependent on Human Growth Hormone levels that increase with high intensity and anaerobic workouts. Overall, HGH decreases with age without HGH treatment. In women post menopause, bone density nor size will not increase due to reduction of various hormone levels, however, this too can be mitigated by HGH treatment and hormone therapy but with possible side effects. 

Dehydration has a negative effect on metabolic rate in skeletal muscular metabolism in that it hinders metabolic efficiency with strain and heat. See this link for the full article. And this one for a research publication. 

Bone: Any exercise that places regular stress on a given bone will increase bone density overtime. For the wrist specifically, strengthening the forearm and hand muscles (in the forearm) will have the greatest effect. When you do these other exercises these muscles are still indirectly strengthened as supporting muscles and, in the case of the bench press for example, there is a lot of stress placed on the bones when in the starting and ending positions. The process of bone density and growth is a relatively slow process and depends on many factors. Some factors are genetic in nature but the most notable are related to gender, age, hormones and nutrition. If you're a female beyond menopause then your bone density cannot increase and you should limit these high impact activities especially if you're at risk of osteoporosis. This is one reason why women should participate in strength training and high impact activities while they're young as they're bones will become more dense and therefore stronger to prevent osteoporosis later in life. For males bone growth may slow with age but it does not normally stop altogether unless there are other genetic, nutritional, and/or hormonal factors. (See below for more detailed explanation on bone growth.) Muscle: The term wrist is literally where the carpus or carpal bones are but many people actually mean the lower forearm when they refer to the wrist. There are also muscles in the forearm, such as the Flexor Carpi Ulnaris and pronator quadratus. The pronator quadratus is in the wrist where you would wear a wrist watch, but not in the wrist proper, (where the arm meets the hand or where handcuffs go). These can be strengthened as well. These muscles can increases in size as well with weighted movements. 

Fat percentage by measurements is towards the lower end of the scale dor reliable and accurate. The order generally goes (with the caveat that the tester must be trained/experienced) 

There are a couple of different types of pants that aid recovery, but neither of them are really "pants" in the traditional sense. Most of them are compression tights, or you can also get compression socks or compression sleeves that cover from just below the knee to the top of the foot. There are several brands of compression hose available on the market, a couple of brands are 2XU, Zoot and Beaker Concepts. You can also get the medical version CEP or TED hose, and it's basically the same effect. You can get these anywhere from $20 - $200 depending on brand and size. There are also large inflatable boots/pants made by a couple of manufacturers (NormaTec and Recovery Pump) that encapsulate the entire leg or just a boot, and they work by inflating and deflating chambers in the pants to massage, improve circulation and reduce swelling and fatigue. There are quite a few elite endurance athletes that use these, Chrissie Wellington (3x IM world champ), Meb Keflizighi (Oly silver in the marathon), and others of that level that can justify the cost. They run $1000-2000 for a set. The compression in them runs from 10-30mm Hg (For comparison, a blood pressure cuff will generally be pumped up to 140-180 mm Hg at its highest), depending on the style, manufacturer and where on the leg it is. My n=1 is that I am wearing Zoot compression sleeves on my right calf to control swelling while I am rehabbing a ruptured Achilles, and they work amazing for that. Since this is my first experience with them, I can't speak to how well they recover for long endurance events, although some of my sponsored triathlon friends swear by them. 

As shown in the chart, you'll need lower the overall reps to sets ratio with increased weight. Injury Prevention/Rest: Not allowing your body time to conduct these repairs by adequate rest can lead to injury by damaging connective tissue, bones, or the muscles themselves by straining or tearing the muscle. There is a biological speed limit on growth and repair. Although it is not unheard of to injure a major muscle, it is more common to injure the smaller muscles supporting the joints involved in the lifts. For example, it is more likely that you'll injure your rotator cuff or shoulder when bench pressing as opposed to the pectoralis major/minor. The soreness that you experience is one of the ways your muscles communicate to your body that they need rest. In this way, they "speak" for themselves. Although they can communicate with soreness, it is NOT an adequate indicator of muscle fatigue or to prevent injury. Heavy lifts above 75% of 1RM should be worked into gradually and should not be done by novices who have not properly preconditioned their body for stress and strain that ensue in heavy lifting. Proper from is very important so you do not put undue stress on your joints/back and connective tissues. If your unsure, stop, ask and/or research. Maximizing Gains      Testosterone: It is widely known that anaerobic resistance training stimulates Testosterone production in males and plays an important part in skeletal muscle growth and repair. (9,10) Testosterone accomplishes this by increasing the muscles' protein synthesis. As a result, muscle fibres become larger and repair faster with higher testosterone levels.
