It was challenging to get the lower nut onto the end of the bolt, inside the horizontal hole. To do this I wrapped some tape around the end of the screwdriver, sticky side out. I used this to position the nut at the end of the bolt, while I tightened with the socket wrench. When I discovered that the horizontal hole was too small to get a wrench on the end, I jammed the screwdriver between the nut and the edge of the hole and managed to keep the nut from turning while I tightened the bolt. Step 1 was by far the most time-consuming for me. An experienced wood worker with better tools might find this easy, but it took half of my construction time (1 of 2 days) to figure out how to do this and bolt the fenceposts together. Step 2: Nail the two pieces together using 36-inch 2x4s. To hold them in place during assembly, I leaned one of them against the wall, and tied the other one to a ladder using some old inner-tubes. The result resembles a long, narrow table 6 feet tall. I put one 2x4 at floor level, another 2x4 in the middle, and a third 2x4 on top of each end of the horizontal beam. The lower 2x4s go on the inside; if the long diagonal went on the inside it would create more interference with the bike that hangs next to it. Step 3: Nail a diagonal 6-foot 2x4 cross brace across each of the narrow ends. This increases the stiffness of the frame by a surprisingly (to me, anyway) large amount. Step 4: Nail a horizontal 2x2 at floor level to connect each of the legs for stiffness in the long dimension. Originally I used 2x4s here, but they interfered with a couple of my very long wheelbase bikes. The 2x2s provide just enough clearance for these bikes. 

This photo is even better. 2 clutches. Moving forward pushes right against hub housing, conjugating sprocket with hub housing. Moving backwards pushes left against coaster brake pad. Pads does not rotate because of being engaged with brake arm attached to frame. Because of friction hub housing start to conjugate with brake pad. No force applied - everything disengaged. 

edit after comment: This photo should explain why wheel is not conjugated with chain, while no force is applied on the pedal. At the right side we can see rollers in its housing. It slides back and forth. 

But note - they use components available at the market, priced about or below the average. From my observation, the most severe problem to this systems are: thefts, vandalism, flat tire, not mechanical failure. Popular IGH's are quite durable, it does not suffer from weather condition. Have a look at countries (DK, NL), where lots of bikes park outside for most of the time. Bikes equipped with roller brakes, full chainguard and IGHs remain serviceable for years, without frequent maintenace. It would be also very (too) expensive to order dedicated component for bike sharing system. Let's say that popular systems grow at most by few thousands bicycles every year. Compare it to to SRAM company that quit making IGHs because of low demand, reaching 200k units. Instead of making bikes super-ultra durable and theft-proof companies balance cost and bicycle "life expectancy". The less bicycle costs, the better for the company, when it gets stolen. 

I tried making a bike rack like the original poster's sketch, but wasn't satisfied with the result. The bikes aren't very stable because the rack only holds the bottom part of the wheel. It works much better to make the slots vertical instead of horizontal, so almost the full height of the wheel is supported. I happened to have some six-foot long 2x4s and some 30-inch 2x4s. I butted them together and nailed them into a box, with the two long pieces forming the top and bottom of the rack, and the short pieces vertical. The bottom piece rests on the floor. I spaced the vertical pieces at varying distances to accommodate different widths of tires. 

Now drill a vertical 1/4" hole through the top beam and the end of the vertical beam. The hole needs to end up intersecting the horizontal 3/4" hole in the vertical beam. Having the horizontal hole already in place gives you a target to aim for when you make this vertical hole. Using a long drill bit makes it easier to aim. Counterbore the hole in the top beam. Insert the bolt with a washer. On the other end add another washer and nut. 

Set the shifter to 7th gear. Push the cord toward the shifter. The cord ending should appear in the hole. Pull it. 

Old, plain, one-gear Velosteel-like hubs had this feature thanks to using rollers instead of cogs, but I suppose it does not meet your expectations. If you REALLY need this feature you can modify Shimano Nexus 3 to obtain what you want by removing four cogs from part no 4 shownhere. You will lose 1st gear, rest will work as before. 

I'd like to regrease my roller brakes, because it started to squeak. There is dedicated Shimano Roller Brake grease available, but I'm curious what kind of grease it is really like, what it is made from and if there is any good equivalend, substitute or something with similar composition for general usage. I know that this grease is supposed to be high-temperature-resistant and that's the main requirement, but has it another characteristics, that has to be taken into account? 

Begin by using the spade drill bit to drill a horizontal 3/4" hole a little more than half way through each vertical 6-foot beam, centered 2 3/4 inches from the end of the post. Use the chisel to square off the side of the hole that will receive the lower washer. 

Step 1: Make two large frame members, out of the fence posts. The 8-foot long post sits horizontally on top of two vertical 6-foot posts. Join them using draw bolt joints, as pictured here: 

This rack (barely) stands up by itself, but becomes stable when you have at least one bike inserted into each side of the rack. 

Besides the above concerns, this design was driven by the available materials. I happened to have some old fence posts, approximately 3.5" square. Four of them were 6 feet long after I cut off (most of) the rotten, termite-infested parts that were underground. The other two were pressure-treated lumber, approximately 8 feet long. I also had a number of 2x4s of varying lengths. Conveniently, I determined that I could hang each of my bikes from a hook screwed into a beam 6 feet off the ground without the bottom tire touching the floor. If you ride larger than 56-cm or have a long wheelbase bike, you may need to make your bike rack a few inches taller than mine. The bikes hang on hooks screwed into the bottom of each of two parallel horizontal beams. They hang at an angle, with some overlap. 36-inches of separation between the horizontal beams allowed the bikes to hang without bumping, but since your mileage may vary I encourage you to make your own measurements.

From my experience, this sound comes from crankset/crankarm, that is not tightened properly on the bottom bracket axle. 

But for your actual helmet you should have not any doubts - throw it away. As for motorcycle helmet it is very old. Even when new, your helmet presented worse performance than contemporary mid-end products. Note for off-topic voters: It is off-topic. but It is very important safety issue. 

In my opinion, the most reasonable option is to comply to what "bus traffic lights". BUT, I think this junction lacks bike traffic lights. 

In my native language for "bicycle" we use word "rower", that is not self-descriptive. It comes from UK company name "Rover". Are there some examples in other languages when the etymology for local word for "bicycle" is different than etymology of word "bicycle"? Edit: more detail about "rower" etymology. Saying, that "rower" comes from "Rover" is small simplification. Both words have common ancestor in the name of the company product, "Rover Safety Bicycle". Rover was treated as proper name, otherwise it would be translated to polish equivalent of german "Wanderer". Citation from wikipedia: "In 1885 John Starley made history when he produced the Rover Safety Bicycle". Citation from comment in national dictionary by respectable linguist and lexicographer: "Word 'rowerzysta' (pl. cyclist) (...), comes of course from word "rower", and indirectly from the name of british company „Rover”." Citation from local bicycle advocatory group's page from Toruń: "Because bicycles produced by Starley and Satton company become popular in Poland, its name become polonified and that's why we had rower "
