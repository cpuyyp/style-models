You could point out your increased value to the company, but of course you realize that finishing a master's degree doesn't imply increased value, nor does it mean you should get a raise. Concentrate on the things that benefit the company, rather than things that may benefit you personally. And you can always ask "What should I do to get a [promotion/raise] here?" 

Assuming you are in the US... Yes, it's legal. If you have an HR department, consider putting him on a formal Performance Improvement Plan (some HR departments require a PIP before someone can be dismissed). That will lay out the steps toward either improvement or (more likely) dismissal. If you are too small to have an HR department, consider having a one-on-one talk about his performance and career within the company. No need to be cruel, but you owe it to your team to tell them when it simply isn't working out. Just be direct and emphasize that you can tell by his actions that it isn't working out for him either. You could offer to help him find his next job by allowing him more flexible hours, use of a conference room for phone interviews, etc. I've done this in the past. It was appreciated and ended up working out best for everyone. I was able to open up a slot on my team for a better-suited future hire. And the individual found a different role in a different company that was better suited. 

Often these are budgeted differently, so that is one difference from a company point of view. Some companies standard practices grant one of these costs and not another. For example, my company sometimes pays relocation expenses. As far as I can tell, they never pay sign-on bonuses. From your point of view, I think one-time money is just money. As @Ida correctly points out, some companies (particularly large companies) offer relocation assistance on a regular basis - sometimes to the point of having a contracted rate for those services. In that case, it's not money - just the service - that you receive. If you don't know the company's standard practices in this area, you could always ask for both. (It seldom hurts to ask.) How far you want to press the issues is very context-dependent. You may be in a very high-demand industry, or may individually be a very desirable candidate - someone at whom companies will throw money. 

Just ask. Something like "Can you tell us a bit about the tools and practices you used at your previous company?" should work just fine. Whenever I've joined a company and taken over an existing QA Department, I've usually held just that sort of introductory meeting and volunteered just that sort of information. That said, I disagree with the premise in "The answer to this will indicate/suggest if there could be any major technical & process improvements here or not.". A QA Manager can only work within the context of the company/department/budget given to them. While I have general philosophies of how QA should work, it never comes out exactly the same twice. Often, the needs of the new company don't match the needs of the prior company. I've worked for some companies that desperately needed everything, but had little budget. I had to focus on the near-term while trying to set the stage for the longer term. I've worked for other companies where the near-term was already under control, and that had enough budget to work on higher-level achievements. And I've worked for other companies where I was told what my priorities were by upper management - and where they weren't at all like the prior company, nor what I would have chosen myself. Instead of asking just about the previous company, consider asking "And what are your priorities coming into our shop? Where do you want to see us go?" I think you'll get more meaningful answers. 

So now you know to always bring your laptop to status meetings, so that you can answer these questions. Or bring a printout or whatever it takes for you to keep tasks straight. You are new. And presumably still adjusting to a new set of expectations. Don't sweat it, just learn from it. 

No, in the US at least, that's not something you can force. As you have indicated, the company doesn't need you anymore. Thus you have no leverage to force anything. Even in Germany I don't see you having enough leverage to force a golden parachute situation if your contract and local laws don't already have that in place. You could attempt to negotiate something, if you think your boss and company are appreciate of your work and willing to be "nice". You could try something like "Look, boss. I know that the project got cut and it seems that I'm the odd person out here. I'd like to help transition everyone to the new projects while I find my next job. Can we talk about a severance package where I get paid while I spend some weekday time job hunting?" (Or just a discussion about any kind of severance concession you would prefer.) The risk is that they just say No and let you go. (Or perhaps in Germany continue to give you trivial tasks indefinitely). Or you could just accept that these sorts of things happen, find your next job, give the appropriate notice, and leave. 

You are worried about nothing. I know of no company where someone in the mailroom would take it upon themselves to throw out someone else's mail. Simply make sure you have the correct person's name and address on your mail and it will almost certainly get to that person. No need for special labels like "Personal" or "Confidential". 

Not only would it look bad to apply for a different job in the same company, in many companies it wouldn't be permitted. Many companies won't let you consider a transfer until you have been in your current position for at least 6 month or so. I think you are being a bit impatient. It sounds as if the situation changed unexpectedly with your manager having left. When things are in flux like this, it often takes some time for it to settle down, and for tasks to start getting assigned smoothly. As you indicated "it's only been 3 weeks". Meanwhile, this is your chance to be proactive, and pursue work in your current role that would have value to you, and wold help your team. Approach whoever is supervising your work now. Explain that you have free time and are looking for important work that needs to be done. Offer to help others. Ask if there are books or documents you can read, or online learning materials that you can exercise to help you be better prepared for your role. Ask your peers if they need help and how you can pitch in. 

is probably best. Be aware that while the award may be very meaningful for you, and within the context of your current company, it will probably mean a lot less to people outside of your company. The exception would be if the award is something that is publicly recognized (like a Pulitzer Peace Prize, for example). 

That's true. But don't forget, there's no such thing as a perfect candidate. You can easily be the "best" with a "thin" resume. 

If you are asked to take a test, it's always good to know what the rules are. You want to understand how long you have to complete the assignment, if they are looking for real code or pseudo-code, if the result is expected to be bug-free, etc. And of course you want to know what you are allowed and not allowed to do during the test - access the internet, phone a friend, ask clarifying questions, etc. Before the test starts, just ask if you are allowed to access the internet or not. Then follow whatever rules are stated. 

No. The most junior member who has only a couple of years experience should not be complaining to team leads about the code quality of the most senior member. Let the team lead deal with it - there is absolutely no way that you would be telling them something they don't already know. The reasons that they tolerate it (or perhaps even encourage it as a trade-off for faster time to market) might become more evident over time. If the culture (as evidenced by the behavior of the senior dev and team lead) doesn't suit your quality preferences, you may need to look elsewhere. That said, even a junior member can lead by example. Make sure your work is top-notch and the quality is beyond reproach. Make sure you hit all your deadlines. Make sure you help others where needed. Maybe others will notice and want to do the same. 

If you really want to minimize the potential negative impact in your current employment, do not tell your boss you are looking for another job. Even if asked, don't reveal the truth. 

Saying "I'll do it right away" is far less snarky/whiny. But often it's the way you say it as much as the words you use that matter. Saying "I was just about to start" can be interpreted as "Stop asking me to do things. I know what's important better than you and if you had given me the chance, I would have done what you wanted." Even if that's what you really mean, you have to say it carefully. I usually say something like "Sure. I'll get right on it." with as much enthusiasm as I can, if I actually have the ability to switch tasks right away. If not I usually say something like "No problem. I can get to it in X." (where X is a number of hours or days, depending on the circumstances. 

It's just a polite thing. They are hoping you'll reapply next year. Take the time to boost your knowledge in the areas which need improvement and reapply in a year or so if that works for you. Meanwhile, send a note to the folks you interviewed with, thanking them for their time. That never hurts. 

You aren't your project. And the project is done, so your value will pay off in the future. Obviously they had confidence in you to make you the lead, they will likely have confidence in you going forward. Talk about the great job you did as tech lead. Talk about the quality of work you did on the project and all the hours you put in to meet deadlines. Talk about what you learned, and what you will apply going forward. I suspect you are worrying over nothing. Good managers are able to separate project outcomes from the work done by the individuals on these projects. Everyone has worked on a failed project or two - I know I have worked on many. It seldom costs you anything individually if you didn't have sole responsibility for the project's success. 

Clearly your boss has expectations that you don't understand (or perhaps you just don't agree with them). Talk to you boss. Ask for understanding. Try something like "I'd like to make sure I do my job well. I'm trying to understand your expectations in regard to these other people." That will likely go over well with your boss. But don't go in with the attitude that "I won't mind doing it, but only if you give me a raise." That's a good way to lose your job. Unless you have some sort of very detailed contract (or unless you live in a part of the world where job details are handled very differently than in my part of the world), your boss determines the specifics of your role. The fact that it isn't exactly what you thought you understood during the interview, doesn't mean that you have a right to refuse and/or demand a raise. 

You should come clean right now! Worst case you will feel a lot better about yourself. Best case you will feel a lot better about yourself and you will have a new job that you need. 

I assume that you aren't happy with the initial rate, but you took it anyway because you needed the job. And now that you completed the contract, you figure you can get more. It's possible, and probably worth asking for a bit more in a professional way. Be prepared with what you'll do if the reply is "No". Many companies (like the one I work for) assume they can extend a contract pretty much indefinitely without renegotiating the rate. And in my company, if the rate needed to be changed, I'd have to write a new requisition, have it approved up several levels of management, and send it out to the recruiters to fill - even if the original contractor was ready to re-apply. I know this sounds foolish, but it is the way some big companies work. I can extend the period easily, but changing the rate is a big deal. If the answer is "No" you want to be ready to either walk, or accept the current rate. 

No. Resumes are not the right place to provide explanations for things you feel are negative. Resumes should be filled with facts, and positive information - nothing more. In the education section you should include the college, major, and years you attended. Just don't indicate a degree, as that would be a lie. If you are applying for positions that don't require a degree, and the issue comes up during interviews, that's the time to explain why you haven't yet completed your degree requirements and what you are going to do about that (if anything) going forward. 

No. It is neither good nor bad to have LinkedIn endorsements from your family. It's basically just a waste of time for two reasons: 

Perhaps. Or perhaps he just wants to test the bounds and understand the flexibility of the rules now, so that he won't have to do it later. Or perhaps it's even a cultural issue (if the new employee is from a different locale).
