I've had my ins and outs with riding and I've found that buying a new bike only sometimes works. What I'd recommend is maybe trying a new style of cycling or finding something to train toward. I recently started training again and didn't buy a new bike, but did get some new GPS gear to geek out over which is definitely contributed to riding/training being more fun. Buying a new bike can work, but I think most often if it is mixed with learning or practicing a new riding style. Buying a new commuter won't necessarily help you get over being burnt out on commuting, but maybe a new road bike or mountain bike will. 

I take a single multitool when I travel to disassemble/reassemble my bike. I have an older model crank brothers tool that they don't make anymore, but something similar is available here. I run pedals that can be taken on and off with a 8mm hex, so I don't need a pedal wrench. Without a complete breakdown of your bike and all it's parts, one would be hard pressed to tell you definitively what you need. However, a good multitool and possibly a pedal wrench (depending on your pedals) may be all you need. 

That is poorly built and unacceptable (in my book) as a paid for product. If all of the spokes are protruding some, and several more than others, it means that the wrong length spokes were used. The reasons for this may or may not be the wheelbuilders fault, it's possible that some component of the wheel build had incorrectly listed sizing and the spoke length calculation was off because of it (component manufacturer fault). However, it's also possible that the wheel builder didn't have the proper size spokes. The right way to do it in that case would be to take longer spokes and run them through a spoke cutter to get the proper length. In the first case, rather than rebuild the wheel the extra spoke should have been filed down to the level of the nipple. This is acceptable as long as there is enough thread left to properly true the wheel. If too much is sticking out the wheel will need to be rebuilt or it will likely fail at a future truing when the nipple no long has enough threading to secure purchase on the spoke. If the second case is true, and the builder doesn't have a spoke cutter and didn't want to order the proper size, I'm calling foul and would not send future business to them. Unrelated to all that, it may be possible to get a rim strip thick enough to sufficiently protect your tube, but you really shouldn't have to go to that trouble. 

I postulate that poagies are the answer for actual cold weather conditions (below freezing). I wear the same full finger gloves year round from 75F to -40F. I have two sets of poagies from Dogwood Designs, one of the lighter sets and a plus set that allow this. My personal experience is that the gloves required to keep hands warm at temperatures lower than 20F also tend to hamper manual dexterity and make shifting and braking a pain. Poagies have the added bonus of keeping your shifters and brake levers clean in nasty conditions. 

TL;DR I feel trailers are a safer option for small children, but the circumstances of your commute may mean that a trailer is not an option or is a huge inconvenience. In that case, I believe that a mechanic installed child seat is/can be just as safe as a "factory" installed child seat and likely far less expensive than a new bike. I (personally) don't ever recommend that type of child seat. Even expert cyclists can crash and since children are often not good at crashing (they don't have instincts to roll, etc) those seats worry me. Accidents happen and those style of seats have never felt safe enough for a small child (let alone an infant). Both of my children (now three and four) have been towed hundreds of miles in a trailer, which essentially encloses them in a roll cage. I've had times I've slid off trails into snow banks, and a rear seat would forced a child's head under snow. With a trailer, it simply tipped into the bank and had no ill effects. All that being said, I don't think their is really a difference between the factory installed model and a well built child seat installed by a good mechanic on a bike properly setup for a rear rack. In your case, if you were looking at the money to purchase and entire new bike, I may consider simply purchasing a trailer which would work with many different bikes and possibly be of other use to you as well (some are convertible and can be used for non-cycling activities as well). If money was an issue, I personally wouldn't differentiate between a factory installed model and a mechanic installed model. 

The vast majority of cycling shoes (road and mountain) are well ventilated and not suitable for cold weather riding. Lake makes an excellent winter boot (I have several pairs). 45NRTH makes the Wolvhammer, which I haven't tried, but have heard good things about. There isn't a market for cold weather "road" shoes since generally road bikes become unsafe/unuseable after there is ice/snow on the road. As far as getting the most out of the footwear you are using, I recommend NOT putting thick socks in your summer shoes. Most people's summer riding shoes are close fitting, and adding extra thicker socks make keeping your feet warm harder since it compresses your blood vessels and restricts circulation. If you can't stay warm with normal socks and booties / chem packs, you may need to look at purchasing a set of winter shoes with extra room for thicker socks. My summer shoes are all 44s. For winter, my shoes/boots are all 46s and 48s. The 48s allow me room for two thick pairs of socks comfortably. If you are going to using chemical heater packs, I suggest sticking them to the top toe of your shoe under the bootie. The won't compress your toes that way and will get better air circulation / stay warmer. 

Different wheel sizes have different advantages/disadvantages. Larger wheels tend to roll over obstacles better (more comfort), and be more efficient once up to speed. Smaller wheels (generally lighter) are easier to spin up to speed, more maneuverable for highly technical terrain and often thought of as stronger (owing to shorter spoke lengths). While it's true that many (almost all) cross country and trail bikes have gone to the 29" format, many other categories have not or have only moved slightly away (650b|27.5"). Downhill rigs are now largely 650b or still 26". Dirt jump frames are still largely 26" format as well. Due to the nature of these disciplines, the smaller wheel format is more appropriate. Like anything else in cycling, equipment should be properly matched to use. 

Yes. Most sorts of reusable link generally have a "snap in" position that the link pops into when you pull on the chain. Between normal chain tension and design, the link should stay in that position. However, with repeated use, you can wear the portion of the link that is tight enough to keep the link in the running/together position. This means the link may become easier to get off, but will also be susceptible to coming uncoupled when the chain has less tension on it. Your individual mileage on a quick link may vary, but generally they are much less expensive than a whole new chain and the reduced cost (to you) by keeping your drivetrain clean will likely be worth it. 

I'd perhaps look at your saddle again. Padding isn't everything and there is a lot to be said for fit/sit bone width. Consider getting measured/fitted. I know what width fits me in the brand I buy. Personally, I think every serious cyclist should know their saddle size as well as their frame sizing. Keep in mind that all your riding up to this point (before saddle change) developed extra padding/tissue/internal callus (whichever) on the contact points of your old saddle. Moving those contact points just a slight bit by getting a new saddle can make quite a bit of difference. Not to be rude, but what is your hygiene like? I would recommend making sure to always wash after a ride (commutes included). Always ride in clean shorts. Toward that goal, if you haven't cleaned/showered/bathed recently and go for a ride, you really aren't riding in clean shorts (your skin isn't clean, even though the shorts are). Consider washing before and after a ride. Are you using a chamois cream of some sort? Part of the problem can be caused just by friction. A good chamois cream can help. Some have various antibacterial/anti-infective "stuff" rolled in and can help on multiple fronts. If you are going to look for less padding in your seat, you may look for more in your shorts. Seven hours for most folks goes past stage type training and into endurance riding/training. Ultra light sometimes gets sacrificed for comfort. You may look for touring or thicker winter padded shorts/bibs and opt away from ultra light race padded shorts/bibs. I have done a fair amount of winter endurance riding (100 miles on snow) and sometimes you just forget your prep and end up with a sore. I've lanced my own in the past to speed healing, but that's not for everyone. Once you have one (I have my own set and recurring spots), it's kind of always a preventative fight while you are trying to train. In the end, if all your equipment is properly fitted, proper hygiene and prep (wash before/after, clean shorts and chamois cream) just become a regular part of your training like bike maintenance and proper nutrition. 

One of the few things I can think of is that if the fork fails, or is improperly adjusted, having the brace in the back means there is some possibility that the brace will slam into the downtube or back of the headtube rather than the just the upper and lower of the fork meeting violently. That possibility depends on brace design, height of the upper, frame geometry, etc. But, putting it in front eliminates it as a possibility. From a purely aesthetic standpoint, the brace replaces the area that rim brakes used to occupy on a fork. To some people (me included) placing the brace in the back just looks wrong, making the front of the fork look naked. 

Any shoes bought for winter (below freezing) cycling should be several sizes larger than a rider's normal shoe size. Stuffing more layers inside a shoe/boot that is a close fit actually makes keeping your feet warm harder since it will tend to restrict circulation. This is a very common mistake. I normally wear a size 44, but my winter sets of shoes/boots are 45 and 50. The extra room translates to extra space for insulation (socks). If possible, you should buy winter shoes/boots in a wide size as well, so you are not just getting more room in the toe box, but throughout the shoe. I recommend a vapor barrier sock or other method (plastic bag) to keep your insulation dry and effective. If you have all that going on and still need more warmth, some sort or overshoe is a next step. I have found that the over booties designed for cross country skis usually work fairly well with cycling shoes and and generally relatively cheap. 

It sounds as through you loosened the compression nut inside your carbon steer tube, which you should not have done. That bolt (the 5mm inside) should be tightened once during installation and is not touched for a headset adjustment (or than to perhaps check it is still tight). When you loosened that bolt, you made it so that the top cap will simply pull the compression nut up, rather than pull the fork and compress the headset bearings. Tighten the interior (the 5 mm inside) compression nut in place, then restart your headset adjustment process and hope that you haven't damaged the headset by riding it improperly adjusted. 

I can't see how this would ever work (on it's own) for loosening. It appears to be a poor design. When tightening, the compression from the rubber rings might/should provide enough tension to hold the nut in place while the bolt turns. When loosening, I don't see anything to hold the nut in place. IE, when you turn the bolt, there is nothing to stop the nut from turning as well and not actually loosening. You may try pulling on the end cap with one hand while loosening the bolt with the other. It may provide enough tension to hold the nut in place while you turn the bolt. If not, I'd look into finding a method for attaching the nut to the washer and/or the rings so that something is holding the nut in place while you loosen the bolt. I would not recommend ANY lubricant to the rubber parts (would likely just make the attachment less effective). However, a very small amount of lubricant for the nut/bolt interface may help some. 

I have a trailer with suspension, but I don't believe it has provided much benefit while cycling. Mine is multi-use (jogger, stroller, ski) and I have found it has provided some benefit while hiking. On the cycling side of things, most of the time I am pulling the trailer with a rigid bike (no suspension). I am riding with 5 weight bearing contact points while my kiddos are riding with a full body contact area and no need to maintain control (which is what suspension is designed for). When they were younger, my trailer had an infant sling that kept them fully suspended (similar to a hammock). Now that they are old enough and large enough, they sit in the trailer proper and receive what I perceive to be very little benefit from the suspension while I receive the extra benefit of pulling it's weight. I have been very grateful for the suspension on a few hiking trips when taking them down a rock garden. However, the vast majority of the time, cycling, I'd prefer to not be towing the extra weight. 

Perhaps someone was playing a prank on you. It would be very easy (less than a minute) to deflate the tube, cut it, then pull it out. You actually wouldn't need to touch anything else on the bike and depending on the tire size, might not even need to remove the tire. I have used cut tubes as a "tie-on" bungie cord in several instances, so it's also possible MacGyver was stuck in your bike room and needed it to thwart some dastardly plot. 

It will depend largely on your handling skills and the conditions of the snowy, icy city you live in. Narrower tires, like what you have will cut through small amounts of snow quite easily, but will quickly bog in deeper snow and can be difficult to control when you can't see irregularities underneath the snow. Since they also need to be run at higher pressures, they tend to be a bit twitchy, which is fine on slick even surfaces, but can easily cause slips and crashes where surfaces are uneven (transitions between roads, bike paths, sidewalks, etc). I often commute in the spring on narrower studded tires, but am very careful around transitions, or uneven slick surfaces (jumble ice). They are great for icy patches left by melt/thaw cycles, but definitely less forgiving than a wider tire. By contrast, I can maintain more speed or jumble ice and the like with the studded tires on my fat bike. TL;DR I skip using them on days where you have deep snow, or in areas likely to have slick and uneven surfacing. 

A wheel could theoretically be trued by tension alone if you started with a perfectly manufactured rim, hub, spokes and nipples and you were building a perfectly symmetric wheel. The reality is that there are minute differences and that tolerances are not all that tight. Not to mention that ultimately the wheel has to go into a frame that also may not be perfect (dishing). The short answer is no. I've had many sets of hand built wheels that were beautifully crafted and never saw a tension meter because the tension was hand checked. But, they were built in a truing stand and were incredibly close to perfect. Your initial presumption is incorrect.
