[end edit] As an aside: it seems you think that somehow scientific concepts are ill-defined; they are not: everything is defined rigorously, science does not attempt to find the 'why' of things, just the 'what'. Force is mass times acceleration; acceleration is increase in velocity. Velocity is distance moved per time; and so forth, eventually coming to rest at defined measures that anyone can use (generally with easier to use alternatives, such as a ruler or stopwatch, but at heart defined upon some physical property measured as accurately as possible) thus making anyone that uses the terms able to run tests on any scientific hypothesis without any disagreement as to what force, etc. are. However, this does not hold for 'X was created'. Created is not a well-defined concept, nor is it measurable. Axiomatic definitions are fine, but they must be well-defined to be science. In a purely philosophical discussion, yes, definition of terms may sometimes lead to an infinite regress, and at some point you have to find common ground in your definitions without arguing them. And, although your second question definitely has long been a matter of philosophical discussion, turning it into a scientific discussion most certainly does require definition. (And, really, once you have done that, it's hardly even the same question.) 

Descartes teached that because he thinks therefor he is. But did he tell something about the question whether there are gaps between thoughts? So probably we could not exist between those gaps? Or wasn't it possible not to think or was thinking just a quality a human posesses? 

In the early days, atoms existed according to Democritos. I think Democrites just hypothesized this to build up his world view. Probably there would have been also philosophers who claimed that everything was divisible to infinity (was perhaps Aristotle such a person?) But when asking in nowadays physics it is said that elementary particles can't be divided anymore, because the just decay in certain given other particles. But is this view of nowadays physics the truth? There are muons electrons quarks and neutrino's which can't be divided anymore. But why should this be true? Why can't a particle be split into infinity? Ok, it is probably hard to do so, but is there a more profound 'law' which does state this view? 

I do appreciate the attempts to detail the differences in the other questions; and I do think that a lot of good points are covered. But I believe the answer to your question is fairly straightforward: The simple fact of the matter is that Q1 and Q2 are addressing different types of subject matter (this is assuming that by 'created' you mean 'created' in the same sense that is usually intended when asking 'was the Universe created'). Q1 is an empirical question. You mention that—being a statement about all bodies—there is no way to fully test whether the law holds. This is true, but it is also a non-sequitur. Physical Science is concerned with finding a model of the Universe that most closely aligns with experimental, empirical, data; no general law will be fully testable. The point is that over time, a massive number of observations are taken, and over time the model is changed as theories are found that more accurately allow for both modeling of past events, and prediction of future ones. Q2 is a metaphysical question. Is there something outside the Universe that created it? (If the question is a physical one, e.g. is there something inside the Universe that created everything within, then the answer is: current experimental data gives no reason to suggest such a thing.) As a metaphysical question, it is inherently non-scientific, as physical science is concerned with things that are within the Universe, rather than things outside and/or prior to it. If you have particular hypothesis about some physical condition that would hold as a result of "everything was created" being true, then you would have two things to deal with: the reasoning leading you from the statement to the hypothesis, which would be non-scientific; and the hypothesis itself, which could be tested against existing physical models to evaluate it. Note that the question of whether any particular hypothesis proves that the overall statement is still outside of science, as science is not geared towards making such determinations. [edited: 2014-07-07] As the question is more-or-less a summary of (or parellel to, depending on the scope one allows) the belief that 'creation science' is a scientific endeavor, a discussion in the comments led me to the following quote from the Wikipedia article on Creation Science , which I think summarizes things quite incisively: 

You are not obligated to cast a vote if don't believe in supporting any of the candidates. You commonly here people refer to choosing the lesser of two evils. In the democracy I know everyone has the right to government, so if you don't agree with any of the decision makers that are running for government you don't have to vote for them. You have every right to complain about the lot of them, and even establish your own political party that promotes your views, write your own policy, and run for government. You should look at how many political parties there are in Canada, some of them are hilarious. Last year some of the parties that were recognized in the provincial elections in my home province included; the Communist, Excalibur, Marijuana, Platinum, Unparty, Vision, & Work Less parties. Next time your friends tell you that you don't have the right to complain, tell them that they don't have the right to silence or censor your opinions. 

According to his theory there is only one substance and that is God/Nature. But if God is only good can there be any evil or bad behavior etc.? 

Perhaps more a physics question, but there is also a philosophical question why physics validate all measurements as the same. Of course one could ask why should one particular measurement be the only 'real' one. Of course this is all about special relativity. But a bit in line of Ockhams'razor one could also suggest that the measurement with the less variable parameters should be the most right one. But if one measure the length of something with a ruler just laying it besides it, it should be a more accurate measurement of the length of something than of the measurement of a observer in motion relative to that length. But in physics both measurement are equal in validity according to SR. Only light is absolute. So the question is, isn't a measurement with less variable parameters not more accurate than one that is depending on the observers'conditions?
