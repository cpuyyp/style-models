The graph is not edge-transitive because the three "cross edges" are not equivalent to the 12 other edges. Each one-factor of this graph must use exactly one of the three cross-edges, e.g. 2-5, and a pair of opposite edges from each of the two four-cycles induced by the vertices on each side other than 2, and 5, making a total of four one-factors using 2-5. Similarly there are four using 3-6 and four using 4-7. So we have twelve one-factors, giving a total of 60 edge-occurrences in a one-factor. Twelve of those occurrences were cross edges, leaving 48 occurrences shared between the remaining 12 edges, meaning that each non-cross-edge also appears in four one-factors. 

First it constructs the graph, checks that it is 4-chromatic, runs through each edge and checks that the edge-deleted graph is 3-chromatic. Finally it confirms that there are no hamilton paths - Sage apparently only has an "all paths" command for directed graphs, so I just turn the graph into a digraph where each edge becomes two opposite-directed arcs. 

There are several rich theories of analysis on non-archimedian theories. Neal Koblitz' book on $p$-adic analysis is a good introduction. Non-archimedian analysis by Bosch, GÃ¼ntzer and Remmert is more encyclopedic. Berkovich's Spectral Theory and Analysis over Non-archimedian Fields introduces his beautiful theory of analytic spaces allowing for a reasonable algebraic topological theory. In Goss's book Basic Structures of Function Field Arithmetic there is a good introduction to analysis in positive characteristic. Your suggestion that this subject might have something to do with model theory is apt. As the above references show, the theory may be developed without model theory, but it has been studied intensively via model theory giving interesting results about quantifier elimination, uniformity across the $p$-adics, and establishing a basis for motivic integration. You might want to look at the paper by van den Dries and Denef, $p$-adic and real subanalytic sets. Ann. of Math. (2) 128 (1988), no. 1, 79--183. 

In a short 1946 paper "On Hamiltonian Circuits", Tutte proved the famous result that an edge in a cubic graph lies in an even number of Hamilton circuits. He attributed the result to his friend CAB Smith, but explicitly mentioned that the proof was not Smith's proof. What was Smith's proof? 

When working with large numbers of graphs, a canonical labelling routine is essential as, after the initial cost of canonically labelling each graph, it permits isomorphism checks to be replaced with identity checks. Currently I am working with large numbers of transitive permutation groups; the degree is small (40ish) but the size of group can be large, and my programs are gumming up due to having to perform large numbers of - not exactly isomorphism - but conjugacy checks. (I need to check each pair of groups to see if they are conjugate in the symmetric group.) This process would be considerably easier if there was a known way of finding a canonical conjugate of the incoming permutation groups... 

As far as I understand, no, Vaught's Conjecture has not been resolved. We held a reading seminar on Robin Knight's proposed counter-example closely following each of his drafts and simplified presentations here at Berkeley some years ago and were ultimately convinced that the draft of January 2003 does not contain a correct disproof of Vaught's Conjecture and requires more than minor emendations to produce a complete proof. We did not discover any essential error, though there were important points in the argument where it seemed to us that even the author had not worked out the technical details. That said, it is possible that revisions he has posted since then are sufficient, though in view of how much time it would require to enter into the details of the argument, I am not willing to work through the later papers until the basic architecture of the proof is certified by some other expert. To be fair to Robin Knight, his work in set theoretic topology is well-respected and his construction takes into account the relevant features required for a counter-example to Vaught's Conjecture. If you would like to know whether or not he believes that his proof works, you should ask him directly. If he says that he does believe the proof to be valid, then you can attempt to check the proof yourself. The difficulty in reading his manuscript is not the amount of background material one must know in order to follow it, but exactly the opposite: almost everything is developed from scratch so that one must hold the entire construction in one's mind without having the usual anchors of established theorems. 

There is no smaller example. Various places, including Andries Brouwer's list of parameters and existence for small SRGS ($URL$ show that there are only a handful of parameter sets to check. Those with fewer than 25 vertices can almost be checked by hand as they fall into a few families (Paley graphs) or are well-known individual graphs (e.g Clebsch graph). For the parameter set $(25, 12, 5, 6)$ there are exactly $15$ graphs and they have automorphism groups of orders $1$ (twice), $2$ (four times), $3$ (twice), $6$ (four times), $72$ (twice) and $600$. 

If you replace a vertex of the Petersen graph with a $K_{2,3}$ in the obvious fashion, then this gives a graph on 14 vertices with 12 two-factors all of type $(5,9)$. Also there's one on 16 vertices obtained from Petersen by a different vertex-replacement.
