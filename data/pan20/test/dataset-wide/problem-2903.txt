In either case the evidence might be valid or invalid, but its worth (or lack of worth) doesn't stem from its origins. Note: There is a very big difference between committing these fallacies versus treating the evidence provided by two different groups differently based on actual differences in standards, processes, repeatability and so forth. 

This is basically an analogy of the form Gun control IS TO reducing deaths from gun violence AS making it harder for sober people to own cars IS TO reducing deaths from drunk driving. So whether or not the analogy is good depends on how closely the parts match. As it stands, the biggest mismatch is the "sober" on the right side, which has no natural counterpart on the left. Thus this version of the analogy implies that everyone who would be affected by gun control would be an analog of a "sober" person --i.e. someone with no inclinations towards gun violence. This is probably not supportable, and it also has the issue that it also has questionable implications on the right: i.e. that "soberness" is a stable permanent category, instead of a transitory state of being. If you clear out the word sober, the analogy is immediately much better. It now reads Gun control: reducing gun deaths :: making it harder to own cars : drunk driving deaths This still has the issue however of the "drunk" stipulation on the right. Again, there's no obvious analog on the left, and again there's an illegitimate implication (that all gun deaths are results of the same type of flagrant misuse of guns as drunk driving is a flagrant misuse of a car). So we can clean the analogy again and yield Gun control: reducing gun deaths :: making it harder to own cars : reducing car deaths This is arguably a decent analogy, but it cuts both ways. On the one hand, we don't eliminate car ownership because people get in accidents. On the other hand, car ownership actually is controlled fairly extensively. There are other potential disagreements with this analogy over whether or not cars and guns are actually comparable, given their contrasting usage and purposes, but this takes care of all the intrinsic structural weaknesses. 

Aware of something. It's function to perceive differences. Further it leads us to thinking on something. Feeling on something. It's function to put us on focusing on something. It has relation with emotions. 

There is no equality at all in between "something" and "nothingness", and it asserts absolute differentiation (there is no the sameness at all) in between "something" and "nothingness". Absolute differentiation in between "something" and "nothingness, it asserts essential differentiation (it’s not “i am different than you but we have the sameness a little bit”, but it’s strictly “there is nothing on me that exist within you”), therefore there is consequence: 

If we compare between our expectations with the size of the steps to achieve what we expected based on the general view or a particular view. Then we will feel that "we are waiting for something so long", or at reasonable (speed of) time. But if anything follow "the one time" (as described above), then our perception of speed of time maybe agreed generally (at least on majority level). Speed of time depends on where to put our perceptions on changing based on "one time" or relatively. 

There's a similar problem with rationality in general (reasoning with abstract concepts), but this is more complex. And, of course, qualia (which is also very threatening for materialism, but even a denial of qualia – that is qualitative, subjective experience – isn't that extremely costly as a denial of intentionality, which dissolves the meaning of truth itself). 

The final conclusion is certainly in the last paragraph, the first and second paragraph are intermediate conclusions. This is because there is some tacit (weakly supported) inference made to get to the the assertions in the last paragraph. Let's assume the authors of “After Tobacco: What Would Happen If Americans Stopped Smoking?” really did a careful analysis1, we still have non-healthcare costs, that is increased burden for social security by longer life expectancy. Those costs may very well outweigh increased productivity and saved healthcare costs. It's a ghoulish argument, but that doesn't make it wrong. 

I don't really think that anyone has entered a contract just by living in society. Using the state's services can't be realistically considered consent – because it can't be totally avoided: the anarcho-capitalist may not want to use the state-built road in front of his house, but it's just there! So from a moral standpoint, it truly is forced upon people to pay taxes. No need to sugarcoat this. But even the most libertarian (stable) societies retain an element of coercion to cooperation by force. The overwhelming majority of people want to live at least in a minarchist state, whose services have to be paid for. And it is simply a consequence of the free-rider problem that there cannot be a way of opting out of that. Most people accept that, so most people are not anarcho-capitalists. 

It is often criticized, but Descartes' argument for God in the Meditations is at least intended as what you seek, a purely rational argument for the existence of God, independent of all empirical observations. As such, it probably traces back to the abstract neo-Platonic conceptions of God as the unity of all perfections, which are likewise not founded primarily on sensory data. 

I'm not sure the first question --whether there can be moral motivations "independent of human feeling" is answerable --but the second question, about the psychopath, is the entire subject of Plato's Republic. His answer, if you don't mind spoilers, is that it's always in your best interests, properly understood, to act morally, even in the case where the opposite seems true. It's well worth reading --the arguments are actually very good, even if you're not a Platonist. Ultimately, however, it all comes back to his central contention that morality is deeply fundamental to the structure of the universe. 

This is a problem only in the case that we equate truth with the consensus of the majority. I'm sure some thinkers have argued for this view of truth, but my sense is the vast majority of people would reject it. In terms of establishing a norm for a given community, however, it's quite possible that the appearance of consensus can change opinions. It also has been shown that the views of any given subgroup tend to become more and more radicalized when they interact mainly with each other. Again this is an epistemological danger chiefly in the case that you consider opinion as foundational to truth. 

As far as I understand the Aristotelian arguments (including those made by Aquinas), they conclude from the determinacy of thoughts that intellectual thinking cannot be wholly material and so we have a soul, which is partially immaterial and incorruptible. “Material” is just a word – it has to be filled with content. It does not seem so clear what Aristotle means with “material”, though it is obvious that it is much richer than the modern scientific conception of “material” (or rather “physical”). For example consciousness is clearly material for Aristotle. If we look around us in the realms of physics and biology we presumably don't see anything as determinate (general, normative – thoughts are about the truth – and inherently meaningful) as our human thoughts (though, maybe, there are other intelligent species we don't know about). Some philosophers like Dennett (see his two-bitser example) would disagree, but we'll put those objections aside for now. But imho from this we can at best conclude that humans are somehow special contrary to other animals (when – homo erectus? homo ergaster? – humans became special is another puzzling question, which probably can be turned into a counterargument, but let's leave that aside, too). Of course we can use definitions for “material” and “immaterial” which are so, that humans have an immaterial component while other animals are wholly material. But what have we gained by this? The conclusion the Aristotelian or Scholastic wants to prove is some kind of incorruptibility of the soul. Why should the immaterial not be corruptible, too? It's a very defensible position to believe that our thinking can produce conclusions which are timeless: What Euclid proved is true forever and at all times. And his conclusions were about “objects” which are timeless and incorruptible, like geometrical figures, numbers or other mathematical structures (if they exist – what Plato would have accepted but Aristotle would afaik have denied). But this does not help, either. A bit similar as Robert Pasnau argues in “Aquinas and the Content Fallacy” (thanks to the user Conifold, who mentioned it), I say: Like a teapot can contain tea, but it is not itself remotely tea-like, whatever makes it possible for us to have thoughts about what is incorruptible, it does not mean that it must be incorruptible itself. Does all of what I wrote rest on a misunderstanding of the argument? Did some Aristotelian or Scholastic make the step from the determinacy of thoughts to incorruptibility more convincingly? Or can you give a good restatement of the argument which tackles those issues? 

The main issue here is that you're glossing over your central concept that we can have "proof" of the "flawlessly correct" nature of most of our beliefs. The plain truth is that we have strong support for many of our beliefs about the world, and we have systematic ways, such as science, of building support for many beliefs, but it's unclear that any of this rises to the "flawless" standard you're proposing for religious belief. The resonance and simplicity of terms like "psychological reasoning" and "simple mathematic problem solving" yield a comforting sense of stability, but they are far from unproblematic once you start to unpack their implications. Why should psychology be considered definitive? And whose psychology are we considering --yours, mine, a believer's, an atheist's, a Hindu's, a Christian's? And in what sense are the important beliefs about the nature of life capable of being reduced to simple mathematics? 

The most dangerous statement in your question is "I think one is biased towards the last sentence because it says something that is more or less true." The meaning of a sentence is never based on its truth value in logic, rather whether it is true or false is based on its meaning. If you allow sentences to have their most favorable meaning, you'll quickly run into trouble. It's always tricky and often ambiguous to translate natural language into formal logical sentences, but in this case, I think the only appropriate translation for "Only those who ignore the facts are likely to be mistaken" is "All [Likely to be Mistaken People] are [Those Who Ignore the Facts]." "All [Those Who Ignore the Facts] are [Likely to be Mistaken]" seems plausible from our real world knowledge, but it doesn't actually capture the stated meaning of the original. 

Anything we do based on our thinking and our emotions. Whether we did something because of someone else, but eventually we did: 

Please, don't judge easily, "this is real", "that is not real" related to reality as it is. Rather than distinguishing this or that is real, we better assert, there is different level of reality. Why? Because if our consciousness can be trapped within something, then something maybe considered as real. Unless we are saying "this not real" that has relation with lying. 

Freedom within Dependence upon Something Escape But since mostly we are dependence to something else, then in general, we are within boundaries. Free is an escape. Escape from what? Free is an escape from dependence to something. But if we can escape from dependence to something then we have to stay within another boundary. If that so, then where is our freedom? Is freedom an escape from all boundaries? Surely no! 

Simply put, the position of philosopher as an observer has already different. Pulling it down from top to downside, from social, down to particle, where those are having different position relevant to different viewpoint, therefore those must produce different sightseeing however it is. You might say that there were two with the same quality of understanding but actually not identical at all. Because when you try to understand things from different people, you may consider any possible different aspect from the speaker. 

You can't be sure about our observations of the world. Sometimes our senses are deceiving us, too. Now, as there are ways to corroborate our observations, there are ways to corroborate the results of our thinking. 

Finally, he argues, the emotional reaction we observe, when people accept the subjectivity of values, is evidence that they were pretty convinced of the objectivity of values: 

The observer knows the time t, or to be more precise, it was stipulated and the observer knows it because the definition of grue is well-known. Otherwise the paradox wouldn't even work. The whole point of the paradox is that by using induction, the observer arrives at nonsensical propositions like "Grass is grue."; if he didn't knew the meaning of grue, including the exact time t, this would not be possible. The formulation "arbitrary but fixed time t" is just to emphasize that nothing interesting needs to happen at time t, it can be any time in the future. 

1 though what Dawkins describes as "grandeur" and "beauty", to me just seems the unimaginably hugeness, complexity and scariness of the universe. 2 Alex Rosenberg: "The Atheist's Guide to Reality: Enjoying Life without Illusions" 3 for example, see Richard Dawkins & Steven Pinker: "Is science killing the soul?", Edge 1999 

If we make a comparison to human. Human having abilities to do as animals and plants did but with wider ranges. It puts human as being with higher consciousness. Compared to zombies, since zombies have abilities as already described, then zombie must be considered having new consciousness differently to previous consciousness (whether it might be considered from subconscious or being possessed). Final (Advanced & Limited) Justification 

It can be provided by switching our awareness to get possibilities to know (make comparison) whether there are wrong continuations. And this degree of comparison to make comparison can be created through: 

Practically: Stating a bi-conditional in plain English can be provided by: Emotionally To avoid ambiguous, "I'll buy you a new wallet if you need one" must be replaced with: 

Different degree of comparison "How do we know that this current life is the real continuation from the past life as it should be?" "How do we know that this current life is the fake continuation? 

How can we decide that one statement is more objective than the other? The more a knowledge can be accepted by as many as our possible senses, the more a knowledge can be considered more objective, the more it becomes closer to us (more real). 

No, because “property rights” is a broad term. It doesn't mean that you have to be an anarcho-capitalist to believe in property rights (though anarcho-capitalists would disagree, of course). There can be a constitutional right that the state is only allowed to interfere with your property by levying taxes on your income and has to accept payment in the legal tender – which would prohibit the state from confiscating your “precious” (in the words of Gollum). This would be considered “property rights” (though in practice, property rights are narrower; e.g. “eminent domain” etc.). Now, should anarcho-capitalists move out into the woods? That doesn't really help, they are still subject to the state's laws, which conflict with the anarcho-capitalist conception of property rights (any restriction of hunting on unowned land is illegitimate for the anarcho-capitalist), and, theoretically, taxes. They probably have to move to a true no-mans-land, like Antarctica. 

Why is the third man argument in Plato's Parmenides seen as a more or less decisive refutation of Platonic realism (Plato's theory of forms)? The argument rests on the assumption that self-predication of a form must not be allowed. But why is self-partaking (a form partakes of itself) seen as so unacceptable? 

There is no absurd understanding here, because "the wall has a right to defend itself, but not, as envisioned in humans". It's not about conflicting one understanding to different situation irrelevantly. It's not about giving the rights to animals or giving the rights to the wall or similar things the same as giving the rights to human. It's not about giving the rights to anything equally. But this is only way to ensure: on our understanding How far for an understanding can be widen to let us see an understanding from any different angles. Further this can be used to determine where to put ourselves or any other things fairly, correctly. 

An understanding that we couldn't stay away from selfish, this doesn't mean there is something bad on our behavior (attitude, personality or similar to these). But seeing selfishness as a good behavior must be viewed from different direction. 

Understanding something (whether it's a question or not) with no relation whatsoever to appropriate possibilities of reality, is the same as understanding something outside reality. It's out of question! What is wrong with this question? What is wrong with this condition? What is wrong with this request? Does this condition lead to something? Can you help (response) appropriately to this condition?
