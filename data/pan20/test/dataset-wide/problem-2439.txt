No because it is the letting go of something that never existed in the first place... It is like unknotting a knot. 

If we stop chanting a Mahayana mantra/dharani for a few days how does this effect the gathering of merits? Is it a cumulative effect or multiplicative effect of chanting? Or worse, does missing a chanting session reset the good merit? 

It doesn't force things to happen because karma by definition has no self which can force anything. Karma doesn't really exist as some punishing entity (like a Western God), which is what the word "force" implies in your question. In Buddhism and Hinduism, the chain of causation that binds beings to the Wheel of Birth and the natural conditions that stem from it, creates a torrent of karma all of which must be satisfied in life after life until samadhi/bodhi can be achieved. "Conditions" can be anything by the way. A condition can be being in a certain situation, seeing a certain characteristic of a person (e.g. maleness, femaleness), or even "having a body". Oftentimes I believe that karma has an effect that is beyond time, simultaneously immediate, near, and far.. 

I recommend studying the Six Yogas of Naropa and The Tibetan Book of the Dead, specificlaly the pre-Bardo stages which is the Buddhist equivalent of NDE. One thing in particular that is mentioned is that people's wishful thinking will be actualized. If a person believed in the Buddha, they will see the Buddha, if a person believed they were a bad person, they will see hell. This is a precursor to the actual stage of Bardo and is also why it is important to die happy. I have read some good books about this topic, some of which explains tricks and tactics to succeed in gaining Enlightenment after death (mainly it involves maintaining composure and not being alarmed by anything that may arise) from the Tibetan school. 

Nah, because knowledge is not enough anyway. Even if someone is totally open to learning from you they must be even more eager to put things into practice in order to reach a particular field's skillful attainments. Buddhism teaches the Middle ground: do enough learning but also do enough practice to achieve one's goal. Don't have too much pride in either knowledge nor practice because knowledge without practice is useless and practice without knowledge is blind. That being said, if there is something you can share with someone that you think for sure would help them, then it is the poison of greed to hold it back! Anyway, it is most likely that you are wrong because people can find all sorts of ways to ignroe excellent wisdom and intelligence, nothing is perfectly persuasive.. 

Genetically speaking producing your own children perpetuates your own genes. Buddha spoke at length about the 31 Planes of Existence. What is Buddhism's (not just Theravada) position on having children? Namely the benefits of producing and caring for children? Or does Buddhism mostly see them as a constraint (i.e. Rahula "chain") and there is no connection between between your own progeny and the afterlife? 

Yes, throughout the suttas and many of the Mahayana sutras, like the Lotus Sutra, it is mentioned the various respledent powers that Gautama Buddha shows but also noteworthy is Buddha's personal attendant Ananda who is able to memorize everything the Buddha says but isn't able to get into the assembly of monks meeting after Buddha's death because he does not have samadhi. Only when Ananda is able to attain samadhi (an actual achievement rather than just memorization) is he able to use super powers and join the assembly in discussion of Buddhism's fate. 

Is the attainment of natural wisdom exclusive to Buddhism? No. Do you know other traditions, or religions or ways to attain wisdom? Yes. Buddhist wisdom is not an enterprise owned by any cultural stream. All spiritual attainments are beyond name and form. Watching your mind (which includes the Four Foundations of Mindfulness) is recommended in almost every religious school and any self-developmental seminar worth a penny. I could go into a long tirade as to why spiritual self-development is similar across all religions but there are a limitless explanation on the phenomena of shared experiences (kundalini, chi, visions, emptiness, heat, sweating, etc.). I cannot do this topic justice though because there is a huge burden of proof that is already there. So where do I recommend you look to get a detailed answer to both of your questions? 

The question is, as practiced, an in doctrine, do the various Buddhist institutions expect their monks and laity to understand what they chant? Interesting question: in the time that the mantra was introduced to the people, yes. To gain a benefit from a mantra though it is not technically necessary because the effect is the vibrations themselves which resonate your body and mind with a certain frequency and allow the bodhisattva/Buddha to help you. 

If it helps you center your mind then it is a good start. Eventually though after you have become familiar with this state of peace, it can help you to to reach actual states of jhana (not just a general calming of mind) but you must have a meditation object that you can choose to enter and leave at your own decision--not at the will of the guide. I do binaural beats and I find it very helpful prior to meditation, although some of the beats influence my brainwaves too much. Which is another topic entirely but goes with the principle that I mentioned in the previous paragraph: concentration states are traditionally advised to be achieved with kasinas and breathing. Also, Right Meditation leading to Right Concentration (the last stage) is cultivated in a quiet isolated environment not one with some guided meditation. 

Great tips by the Buddha. To supplemement this I offer a esoteric Buddhist technique taught by Master Huai-Chin Nan: focus at your navel point and imagine a fine bright red point as bright as you can. Imagine this growing brighter and brighter, finer and finer. If this doesn't wake you up, gradually move this point up! Move this point down, if you have TOO much energy. This technique works best after having done the Buddhist contemplations in an above answer. Sleep is a subject I have studied for over 15 years very deeply. There is much to be said about it including: affirmations, lucid dreaming as cultivation, self-hypnosis to sleep BETTER or sleep faster, dream interpretation, circadian rhythm timings, REM timings... so many deep deep topics for you to learn more about! Nonetheless, basic guidelines about rest are important. We should get ample rest before meditating. Master Nan said he would sleep for DAYS at a time and then when he's had enough, he would do a non-stop retreat without sleep for the next week. Strange I think, but I'm just reporting it for reporting sake. Another thing you should know is that the more we stress about the world and the more worldly things we do (things that involve lust, greed, ignorance) I notice the more sleep-need is generated. Also, I have experimented with many different polyphasic sleep styles, I think it is better to learn how to rest every hour through five minute closed eyes and stretching breaks. As much as possible you should design your life to feel good always especially your diet. This is a lifelong journey and for nutritional self-analysis read Mark Hyman's book "The Ultramind Solution." It definitely added to my nutritional understandings. Also learn about fasting, read "Rational Fasting." If there's anything you take away from this: the best way to overcome torpor is to figure a lifestyle out where you don't have it in the first place (and are still getting your life objectives accomplished). 

I went to a famous temple in Rosemead and some ancient sacred items (sariras supposedly) were brought out and I blessed my amulet on them. I left the temple literally half an hour after that and on my drive back home had an accient and my car burned down, totalled. :-( To answer your question, karma and merit is a complicated topic to understand and I don't think anyone will be able to give you a precise answer. One would have to go into the origins of said karma that created this object and those are either infinite as some sutras suggest, incomprehensible (as Buddha avoided the questions about origins of karma), or nil (see Zen master's response to king). You will have to feel the object yourself. Try feeling with your non-dominant hand which is usually better at perceiving these energies. This whole enchanting thing and sariras is something that comes from Vajrayana and the newer traditions which the original branches of Buddhism did not advocate, espouse, or uphold. As much as I believe in crystal energetics and various holistic technologies, I am now wary of "sariras" and know that the highest way to make merit is through appreciation of the Buddha, his teachings, and practice whether it is in the form of another object, ourselves, or others. Try practicing different mantras--THAT is definitely IMO way more powerful than any sarira. 

I agree with the above that there is a small difference: My linguistic analysis is that "garbha" basically means womb, a word that emphasizes the physical, whereas the "tathagata" is referring more to the formless component "Buddha-nature." The term Trikaya, which is what the dhammakaya and rupakaya are collectively called, is more equatable to the term Tathagatagarbha. Dhammakaya refers more to just the mental component of the achievements while the Tathagatagarbha refers vaguely to the Buddha-nature, the dharmakaya.. especially as described in the respective Tathagatagarbha sutras. Thus... yes I would say they are essentially synonyms but one is more specific. 

In Mind-Only school of Buddhism, there is something called the 8 consciousnesses. The 8th consciousnes, aka the alaya storehouse consciousness, similar to an "Akashic record." It is an easily misunderstood concept according to the Surangama Sutra and the late Zen Master Huai-Chin Nan's lectures because apparently one can easily become confused about it. Shakyamuni Buddha (Gautama) said: 

or was it just mind hallucinating because of hunger, thirst? No. You are mixing up chronology of events. The Buddha gave up extreme asceticism before gaining Enlightenment. Did Budhdha really got to know his previous births Yes. By entering the 1st jhana, one can even recall one's past lives. The below passage from MN 36 indicates Buddha went to 4th jhana before doing so, recalling many more. I would refer to the book Mind Experiment by Bavo Lievens for references on Buddhist texts, as well as beautiful Buddhist cosmology and how to go about doing this. Go to page 80.
