Since it seems you don't know the equations, I will try to keep it simple. However, just keep in mind that, in principle, there is no difference between Galactic and extragalactic Cepheids, in this context. Now, we know that a Period-Luminosity relation holds for the Cepheids: $P\sim L$ Where $P$ is the pulsation period observed from the Cepheid, and $L$ is the observed luminosity. We also know that: $L\sim d$ where $d$ is the distance of the source. Then it is like to write $P\sim d$. This means that, if we observe the pulsation period of a Cepheid, we know its distance, and this allows to know the distance of the host galaxy as well. Some basic sources: Cepheid variable Classical Cepheid variable with some numbers And some diagrams too 

Not all models of dark energy assume it constant. However, when this is assumed true, dark energy is usually compared to the energy density of the vacuum. In other words, while the Universe expands, the dark energy increases proportionally, so its ratio with the Universe volume (the density) stays constant. Or, better, we generally believe those models where the dark energy is a constant because they fit better our observations of the Universe, in particular the Big Bang model, which describes how our Universe evolves. If you like some math, you can have it here. 

This is a very well posed question, thanks! The problem is, we still don't know. What we suppose, is that dark matter came first. Primordial fluctuations of dark matter made the right conditions to accrete enough mass to build SMBHs, and then the surrounding galaxy. But still we don't know if, the SMBH comes from merging, of other SMBHs or galaxies, or from high massive BH that are called seed (of the order of $100\,M_{Sun}$). Perhaps, there are very recent developments, which could be known by the experts, but until few years ago, this was the scenario. About the mass issue, we could have a better reasoning if we think to the influence spheres. We discovered a relation between the SMBH mass and many bulge properties (i.e., the luminosity, the velocity dispersion, and others). This means that an object of the order of $\sim1$ pc, influences an object of the order of $\sim1$ kpc (maybe $\sim3$). Plus, the bulge structure is essential to the formation and characterization and classification of the host galaxy. 

It is clear that the star undergoes a change in position. Then usually, the radial measurements go along with astrometrical measurements, to identify the position of the star along the planet's orbit. Of course, you need some conditions are verified to allow this measurement. First of all, you planet must be massive enough to bring a sensible change in the position of the star. Then your instrument must be sensible enough to resolve the tiny effect originated by this change. Possibly, also other conditions play a role, but I am not an expert (you can take a look at here). For a general comprehension, also a wiki for Methods of detecting exoplanets. 

This is a tricky question, not immediate. If we talk about Main Sequence stars, yes, you can constrain your fictional star by two parameters. The crucial parameters in the diagram, as you said, are the mass and the radius. This is why the HR diagram well represents the stellar population with two axis. Of course, for your scope, we need to do some assumptions. For example, the metallicity, that for your purposes can be fixed as the Solar one. Or, that the initial mass is already in a condition to contract. You can see it this way: the luminosity is connected with the radius (because it depends on the irradiating surface), while the temperature is connected with the mass (the more is the mass, the more is the pressure at the center of the star). If you have $L \sim RT$ and $L \sim M$, then you also have $RT \sim M$. The degeneracy from one parameter can be overcame if you have your reference star (the Sun), which allows you to trace isoradii lines on the HR diagram. See here for example: 

The electron in the atom transits from a level with parallel spin (with respect to the nuclear proton), to the lower state, where the electron spin is antiparallel. When this happens, the atom emits a photon, known as the 21 cm radiation, or hydrogen line. This line falls into the radio domain, which can be observed by radio telescopes. Since this radiation comes from rotating arms, doppler shift of the line can trace the distance of the emitter region. And voil√†, you have your map. EDIT: ops, I missed the previous links where the answer was already given. 

Attempt to do an intuitive explanation: The Sun was formed from a cloud of matter. A small amount of that matter remained around the Sun, and had a similar composition. This was the solar nebulae. But the composition of the planets are now not the same as the Sun. This is explained by that some of the matter was collected by the Sun, and some of it was blown out of the system. That was only the light stuff! like hydrogen and helium. Most iron and other metals are conjectured to have remained in orbit, forming the planets. As the Sun is representative for the original composition (partly at least, stellar fusion has skewed the hydrogen/helium ratio). So if iron is 0.14% of the Sun, that is also the original abundance in the nebulae. So all the iron in the planetary bodies is 0.14% of the original nebulae mass. From that you can calculate the original mass. It is a 'minimum' because some of the iron may have escaped as well. 

Yes If a brown dwarf count as a star in this case, the solution is as easy as a smaller brown dwarf orbiting a larger one. If not, it is still possible if you have two brown dwarfs orbiting close to each other, both just too small to be red dwarfs, together out-massing an orbiting red dwarf, just large enough to be counted as a star. While I have no example of such a system, the Alpha Centauri system has to closely orbiting stars, with a more distant star orbiting, and Luhman 16 is a system with two brown dwarfs orbiting each other. 

Use a constellation map! That will provide much of the information you need. Here are however some things you can try to spot: 

Is the Earth spinning? That depends, you can always choose a frame of reference that suits you. However, only one of them are non-rotating, the Inertial frame. In all the others we have fictitious forces acting, like centrifugal or Coriolis forces. We can test if the Earth rotates by watching a pendulum throughout a day. The pendulum would then seem to slowly rotate during this period of time, meaning some fictitious "force" is acting on it. That means that we are located in a rotating frame of reference, and thus the Earth rotates. 

Yes, but no. The basic idea behind the zodiac is as you stated what constellation the Sun is located in during the year. But the time assigned to each constellation (1/12 of the year) is not accurate, for several reasons. Firstly, because of modern constellation borders, some constellations are larger than others. This has also caused the ecliptic to pass through Ophiuchus, not in the zodiac. Secondly, axial precession has rotated the zodiac by almost an entire constellation over the last 2000 years. That is not accounted for in astrological dates. 

The most probable banana-shaped region stretches from Crux to the Large Magellanic cloud. Comparing the image with a constellation map, there are several small constellations that may have hosted the event. Those are Mensa, Chamaeleon, Musca and Crux. 

The apparent motion is observed when the projection of a planet is compared to the star background. There are no real change in the planetary orbits, but when for example the Earth catches up with Mars, it seems to move retrograde relative to the background because of our own change of view. (Like how it appears that you are scrolling further down on this page when the background moves upwards.) 

The "Vernal Equinox" is simply the direction of the line where they cross. You can not obtain the Earth latitude from the ecliptic latitude alone, as the planes are not parallel. You must know the ecliptic longitude as well. From equatorial to Earth latitude it is much simpler, the latitude is equal to the declination. 

Yes, GW has Doppler shift too, as they are travelling at a finite speed, but no, there are no emission or absorption lines we can detect it from. In EM radiation those are caused by the fact that light is quantized, such that certain wavelengths can be absorbed or emitted by atoms. As far as we know, gravity is not quantized, or the effect is too small to be measured. Any irregularity in the signal is then going to be continuous, and not wavelength specific. Detecting a spectra in gravitational waves is unlikely, but would strengthen the theories of quantum gravity and the graviton.
