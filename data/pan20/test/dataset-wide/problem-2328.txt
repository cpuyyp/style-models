You can't ignore the difficulties. Those difficulties are precisely what dictated when you could attempt the trip. For the most part, those limitations still exist. However for the actual calculation and finding of the North Pole, that would be night time, when you could calculate how far away from the pole you actually were, and also whether you are standing right on it. During approach, at night take a compass bearing on the North Star. Using an Equatorial Finder Scope you can calculate how much farther you have to go. Use that compass bearing while traveling during the day, and renew your compass bearing each night since it's likely to shift a lot while proximate to the north poles. One reading per day is likely to be enough since you aren't going to travel very far in a single day. Use your Finder Scope to find the declination to the North Star to update how close you are. Eventually the North Star will be at azimuth (have zero declination), it is then that you are standing on the North Pole. 

I never heard of the pencil trick and I'd be wary. But using a cup with a lid is probably the most obvious choice. 

Go to the local supermarket butcher, ask if he has any shipping styrofoam coolers from incoming meat suppliers. Same as the cheapo ones, but Much more sturdy. 

Roddy's answer is great for study details, but in the nautical realms of boating safety and courses that include boat safety (safe boater, boatUS, USCG, ASA, USSailing,etc) We are taught in New England that if you fall in the water in winter, you have to get yourself out as fast as you can. Any longer than 10 minutes in the water and you will no longer have the strength nor ability to hoist yourself out of the water, and may begin to loose awareness of the fact that your in trouble at all. After 45 minutes floating in winter seawater and the chances of survival are near to zero. Of course there is always the freak incident of someone's body shutting down allowing survival past all comprehension, but that's a very rare exception to the general rule. 

The forces are really trying to pull the ends of the bow forward. The bow string is not elastic and so does not store energy. The end of the bow may snap back and hit you uncomfortably, but it's not going to whip back at amazing speeds. The arm will basically just let go, and the stem and other arm will get flung by the stores energy. However. You should have a good grip on the stem of the bow, so although it may be surprising, it shouldn't go too far as the bow isn't very heavy and thus you don't have a lot of inertia to overcome. I think a bowstring snapping would be more dangerous because it would be like a whip, and may hit you in a very inconvenient place such as your face and eye, and may try to rip skin of your fingers as it's ripped through them. 

The answer is yes, potentially some contaminants could become more toxic compounds when subjected to heat. However the chances of you camping in such a location is rather remote, because places that get contaminated thusly are usually off limits. 

The creases that develop can theoretically compromise rain proofing treatment, especially if those creases cycle (bend and straighten repeatedly) however you can always retreat your gear to get more life out of them. Everything in camping is a compromise between what you can carry and what you need. If you need the stuff you've chosen, and in order to bring it you need to add extra wear and tear to it, then that's one of your compromises. 

It's a combination, Scouting, Orienteering and Reconoiter. Scouting, because you have to find evidence of previous recent passage to find stamp stations. Orienteering, so you know which direction you are going and where on the map you are and have been and where you haven't yet been. Reconoiter, in general because you are exploring with a mission in mind looking for likely places a stamp station might be and ways in and out of various hiding spots and paths of ingress and egress into those spots. 

That's hornwort. It grows around here too. Wonder to fish around as well as lily pads are great to fish around. Anyway, those plants grow at a depth where strong sunlight can get to it. In all natural settings where I have seen this grow it has been less than 6 ft of depth. So I guess it's possible to get tangled and drown, but a few things come to mind. Most people are averse to swimming where things are touching them. You don't suddenly find your self in the middle of a patch of this, you'll start getting touched by the weeds within a few moments of reaching the "border" and would likely start trying to swim in the air while turning around. This plant is also relatively weak and also slippery while under water, so unless somehow you get bound by a bunch at once, I personally don't see this plant as a danger, but that doesn't mean that it couldn't cause harm. I wade out into this stuff and lily pads all the time when fishing for bass, pike and pickerel. 

If you are bottom fishing with a bait that needs to stay on the bottom you want to anchor. If you drift while dragging the bait. You are likely to hook up to something on the bottom like rocks or weeds and your hook is going to get fouled from lighter weeds anyway. In this circumstance you want to anchor and let the bait be. Drifting is good for jigging the bottom or anywhere in the water column really so you can cover more real estate. If you are casting and retrieve fishing, then either is fine really. 

Bow fishing is a sportsmanship hobby like any other. If you like the idea of bow fishing, then try it. If you like the idea of rod and reel fishing, then try it. Which is better? Well, you can only shoot a fish you can see with the bow, and rod fishing lets you hunt for fish in places you couldn't possibly think to use a bow, such as deep water, thick weeds, water so brown you can't see this fish unless it's jumped into the air. The biggest fish get big because they know how to hide. 

If the swans are forced to stay next to shore (as opposed to casually being there), they flock together to avoid predation. In addition to flock safety by numbers, Swans are very tough, and very aggressive. Several swans are a lot more dangerous. If you've ever been attacked by a swan, you will know exactly what I mean. 

Two different kinds of wood, fiber from bark (to make the string and to hold the wood together while gluing), a knife or hatchet, pitch from a pine tree, fire to temper the wood. The stiff wood needs to be on the front of the bow, the less stiff on the back. Edit: if making a recurve, you need to soak the wood, and bend it opposite the direction you will string it (and hold it there. Perhaps with more bark rope and THEN temper it with the fire. Then when you string it the right way, it will be recurred. I should also point out, this isn't going to last very long. You want to update your techniques and materials as you build your toolset up. I.e. Kill your first deer and make tools from the bones and antlers...you need tools to make tools and they lead one to the other until you can start smelting or re-smelting and making tools from metal. Once you have your immediate survival sorted out, you want to build a forge and find a source of metal. You can make a crude hammer head by pouring molten metal into a hole carved out of wood. The wood may catch fire, but the metal should set before the wood is gone. Edit 2: to be honest, you are better off making a long bow at first. It's less complicated, and has less chance of breaking right away (suffers less amount of stresses during use) 

I'd go with the 3 Mepps style lures, and the two spoons at the bottom left of the pic. They'll make more noise and vibrations than the others. The others looks to me to be fast retrieve lures which may certainly attract fish, but if the water is murky may be too fast for the fish to reliably catch up to. 

The suds are caused by protein. Protein is usually consumed by the nitrogen cycle and finally plant life, but if there is enough water churning by wind and white caps and breaking waves it can froth up and dry out and get blown away and get trapped a gyre where is eventually melts back down into the water. Sometimes it gets blown into a beach as you've seen. Oh and by the way, it's completely natural, not something to be concerned about. 

If you are referring to Crataegus, then yes Hawthorne is edible, the pomes are like tiny apples with two flower spots on the bottom. It is commonly made into jelly, syrups and country wine. Regarding the seed, you want to pull this out after cooking the pome just like you would the heavy solids of any other fruit. I know you mention raspberry and black berry as examples of some where you don't have to, but it my opinion the seeds ruin the jelly, and I buy and make seedless jellies. Regarding the toxicity of the seeds, they are roughly as toxic due to cyanide and arsenic as Apple seeds are. You should avoid swallowing too many seeds, but the occasionally missed and swallowed seed is as likely to be as harmful as swallowing the accidental apple seed. 

Oil the knife, then leave it alone until you are prepping your outing. Oil doesn't evaporate, it dries. When it's dried, it has the same and perhaps even better protective properties than fresh oil. It just makes you feel better to see the shiny fresh oil, but unless you wiped it away, it's still there and has dried. When you are prepping for your outing, you want to hone your knife with a honing steel. Knife sharpening is for knives that are too dull to be honed (which means the edge is damaged), a knife that can be honed sharp should not be sharpened because sharpening reduces the life of the knife. 

Disregarding floating devices altogether (because they can easily be abandoned if needed), where and when you decide to swim in tidal waters should entirely depend on expertise of those waters. Currents are local phenomenon which do not necessarily replicate themselves from one place to another because the number of variables that lead to a predictable current are manifold. However there are some precautions that one can take while learning the local waters. If you find yourself in a current that is pulling you out to sea, you should not try to fight the current. You want to get out of the current by swimming perpendicular to the current until you find yourself in water that is no longer pulling you away from shore. Some tidal currents are created by a supply of inland water such as a river or bay, and you will not have the strength nor stamina to fight this current as it is likely to last for up to 6 hours without any hint of letting up. Don't worry whether it's the shore you started with, your goal in this case is to get to ANY shore. You are much safer walking a few miles than you are trying to swim a few miles. Swim along the shoreline until you are no longer moving away from the shore, then turn shoreward and get yourself to dry land. 

You could make your own with a smaller piece of hardwood 1x4. With a jig or bandsaw, cut a notch out for the hook, then remove material along the outside to make it narrow. Guaranteed to be comfortable and sit flat in your pocket. Just draw the hook shape first so you know what it will look like and where to cut. You can even smooth it out with a rasp or file to make it more round rather than squarish. You could even carve or burn or stain/paint designs on it. 

Listen. When it comes to lightening, pretty much all bets are off. There is very little you can do that will have any appreciate or measurable affect on the path that lightening chooses to take except one and that one thing is insurmountable from a camping/outdoorsman point of view. That thing is called a faraday cage. People who think a 1/4 inch of rubber will help insulate you or anything from a bolt of lightening that has traveled a 1/4 mile through air (that's a lot of insulator) are only helping their state of mind and are doing absolutely nothing in the true and practical sense. 

The implications of trespassing and or damaging another's property not withstanding. One can spread the wires by placing a long enough stick between the top two wires and twist, this will pull the top and bottom wire toward one another increasing the gap to the wires below this pair. If there are four wires, you can repeat with the bottom pair. The stick needs to be long enough to get "stuck" behind the other wires when you push it to perpendicular to the wires. 

Methane is a biogas, so you get it from biological processes that otherwise would escape into the atmosphere. When you burn methane, you are converting the methane into water and carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas, but methane is a more destructive greenhouse gas, so it makes sense to capture and use. Propane, butane and others also convert to carbon dioxide and water, but these gases are mined. So where as methane is already in the biosphere, using petrol based gases is adding carbon to the biosphere from naturally sequestered sources. Only real thing you need to know is that you need a different regulator for your gas burning equipment. Methane is a lighter density gas. I should add that methanol is a perfectly good and sustainable fuel, it is the liquid alcohol form of methane. Methanol although coming from other processes rather than gas capture at least still comes from the biosphere in the form of wood as the usual source. 

Two suggestions. Buy canvas sneakers or tennis shoes, or even those flat soled kungfu shoe style slippers. Leather boat shoes. 

Hats are great for many reasons. They keep sun off your head, they retain heat when it's cold. They help keep small stuff from hitting your head and sometimes your face. A branch may knock your hat askance rather than scratch your face up or even poke you in the eye. It can keep that same branch from getting tangled in your hair. A hat is just another layer of protection from the elements on a spot that is often left unprotected except by your hair if you are lucky enough have your hair. 

Riffle vs rapid: a riffle is slow moving over a generally shallow wide flat spot, but has significant turbulence (water moving in all sorts of directions) because of rocks and such. A rapid is fast moving, often deeper section of the river moving faster because it's flowing down a slope. A pool is a place where the water is deeper than the rest of the river, it's generally very slow in the middle but has movement at the head and the water starts pulling faster at the tail ( which is where the water starts to run, hence the name) Regarding how to recognize these. That is really tough to explain which is why there are so many books and videos about it. It takes time and experience to learn how to read these features. Spend some time fishing without your fly rod, walking along the river you want to fish, and study it. A little foam can help, but if there isn't any foam, sometimes you can grab a handful of dry leaves and toss them in the river to see what happens. After the leaves point out to you where a feature is, learn to see it without the help of the leaves. Polarized sunglasses can help you see into the water (if it is clear) after you have studied the top, and may help you learn what below is causing what happens on top. That's probably the best way for you to learn. Don't bring your fishing rod with you though, or you will stop paying attention to the finer details because you will be focused on your line. After a time or two without the rod, you could try bringing your rod but no flies with you so you can reach out and see what the water does farther off. 

Shelter is by far the most important initial consideration. Since you are stranded there anyway, you will have the opportunity to move your camp. Since you specify a tropical island, you want shelter from the sun more than anything else. You won't freeze to death in the tropics if you aren't on a mountain top. So in order of importance based on time before it becomes critical: 1) find shelter from the sun (that's going to be your strongest and most consistent element you need to get out of. 2) find a place to shelter you from wind and rain. 3) figure out clothing (remember the sun?) 4) find a source of fresh water (rain ketching is good but inconsistent out of the rainy seasons) 5) food 6) nutrients - you won't starve from lack of proper nutrition, but you will weaken over longer periods of time (measured in months and years) This is not an emergency survival need, this is a long term health need. 7) medicine - I am placing this dead last because you either have your meds or you do not and there is nothing you can do about this.
