See David Marker's "Model theory. An introduction." Although argument is model theoretic, you can easily transform it into syntactic one. 

[Edition. In this answer I wrote about "philosophical logic" and "mathematical logic" in usual sense of these terms. But I also think that the difference between them is very conventional. For example, people studying knowledge formally by means of modal epistemic logics (as formal models) and those who studying provability logics to a large extent (if one forgets about actual motivations) are doing the same things -- they are investigating various modal logics.] "My question is about relations between logic as part of philosophy and mathematical logic from the second half of the 20th century when its seems that connections between these two areas have weakened." "I am quite curious also about the reasons for the much weaker connections between mathematical logic and formal models developed by philosophers at the later part of the 20th century." The main reason is that mathematical logic concerns with models of mathematical thought, but philosophical logic builds models for various parts of philosophy which are very different from mathematics (i. e. they may use modalities, analogy, induction and so on). To give one example of "formal models developed in philosophy that had become important in mathematical logic", Provability logic is such an example. To quote from Stanford Encyclopedia of philosophy: "Provability logic is a modal logic that is used to investigate what arithmetical theories can express in a restricted language about their provability predicates." So, provability logics are modal logics which capture provability in formal systems of mathematical logic. Provability logic is regarded as an area of mathematical logic (which represented by Robert M. Solovay, George Boolos, Sergei Artemov, Lev Beklemishev, Giorgi Japaridze, Dick de Jongh and so on) and it uses models, ideas and techniques from modal logic which is (in any case, was) part of philosophical logic. "Another thing I am curious about is to what extent for the applications to computer science formal models described by philosophers turned out to be useful." Again, the original papers by Kripke was by no means concerned with computer science. Kripke discovered another way of interpreting the modalities and the context was philosophical one. But today the whole field of program verification in CS is based on modal logic. A lot of specific modal logics are developed in CS which model specific aspects (temporal logics, dynamic logics and so on). Crucial results about them such as expresiveness, decidability and completeness are proved using essentialy the same ideas as those from original papers in philosophical context. Finally, to speak "about works in philosophical logic that were motivated or influenced by developments in mathematical logic", I quote from what I said in the meta thread: "A new interesting field in philosophy is growing in this century often called Formal Philosophy (this term I believe has its origin from the title of Richard Montague's collected papers book). People of this field (among them R. Montague, H. Putnam, E. Zalta, D. Bonnay...) are trying to solve philosophical problems using formal logic. Particularly, and this is important, many of them try to formalize such kinds of reasoning as modality, induction, analogy, simplicity, naturality, generalization and so on as well as concrete philosophical theories (which are of course in the domain of philosophical logic) using formalisms and methods of mathematical logic. 

Let $X$, $Y$, $Z$ be integral schemes of finite type over a field $K$ (i.e., locally affine opens are finitely-generated algebras over $K$). Suppose we have the following condition$\colon$ $f \colon Y \to X$ is finite. We consider a dominant morphism $g \colon Z \to X$. Q. Suppose that ${\cal O}_Y \cap {\cal O}_Z = {\cal O}_X$. Then is it possble that $Y \times_X Z$ is not integral while $Y \times_X \eta_Z$ being integral ? As in the answer below in the case $Y = Z$, there is an example as $Y$ being a normalisation of $X$. 

We shall suppose that for any couple $m, n$ with $m > n$, ${\frak a}_m \mapsto {\frak a}_n, f_m \mapsto f_n$, respectively by the natural quotient surjection $A_m \twoheadrightarrow A_n$, i.e., eliminating variables $X_{n+1},...,X_m$ in $A_m$. Now, I should like to pose the following conjecture: Conjecture: Suppose that $m \gg n$ and $k(m) \gg k(n)$. Then the following inequality holds$\colon$ $l(m) > l(n)$. 

Let us define $A_n, f_n, {\frak a}_n, k(n), \iota_n, {\frak b}_n$ and $l(n)$ by the followings$\colon$ $A_n \colon= K[[X_1,...,X_n]]$, i.e. a $n$-variable formal power series ring over a field $K$. $f_n \colon= f_n(X_1) = c_n + c_{n-1}X_1 + ... + c_1X_1^{e-1} + X_1^e \in K[[X_2,...,X_{n}]][[X_1]]$. ${\frak a}_n \colon= (f_n, g_1, ... , g_{k(n)-1})$, an ideal of $A_n$. $k(n) \colon= {\mathrm{the ~number~ of~ generators~ of}}\,{\frak a}_n$. $\iota_n \colon K[[X_2,...,X_n]] \to K[[X_2,...,X_n]][[X_1]]/(f_n) = A_n/(f_n)$, a finite ring extension. ${\frak b}_n \colon= \iota_n(K[[X_2,...,X_n]]) \cap \overline{{\frak a}_n} \quad \!\! {\mathrm{in}}\,A_n/(f_n)$. $l(n)\colon= {\mathrm{the~ number~ of~ generators~of}}\,{\frak b}_n$. 

Let $A \colon= {\Bbb C}[S_1,\ldots,S_n]$ with $1 \leq n < \infty$ $B \colon= A[X_1,\ldots,X_d]$ with $2 \leq d < \infty$. $O \colon= (0,\ldots,0)$ be the origin of ${\mathrm{Spec}}\,B$. Suppose ${\frak P}$ be a prime ideal of $B$ such that ${\frak P} \cap A = 0$. Scheme-theoretically, this is equivalent to the following condition$\colon$ ${\mathrm{Spec}}\,B/{\frak P} \to {\mathrm{Spec}}\,A$ is dominant, i.e. surjective after taking the closure of the image. Let $H$ be a hyperplane of ${\mathrm{Spec}}\,B$ whose defining equation $h$ satisfies the following condition$\colon$ $h = \Sigma_{i=1}^{i=d}a_iX_i\, ;\, a_i \in B, \phantom{i}^{\exists}a_i \not= 0 \,\,{\mathrm{s.t.}}\,\, a_i \in {\Bbb C}$. and define the intersection $D \colon= ({\mathrm{Spec}}\,B/{\frak P}) \cap H$. There is a natural morphism $\phi \colon D \to {\mathrm{Spec}}\,A$. Q. Is it possible to choose $H$ such that the following three conditions are satisfied? (i) $D$ passes through $O$. (ii) $D$ is irreducible. (iii) $\phi$ is dominant. 

Hi! Let G(N) be the number of graphs with vertices {1, 2, ..., N} and GN(F) be the number of those of them which satisfy graph property F. There is a beautiful result by Glebskii and Fagin that limit of GN(F)/G(N) can be only 0 or 1 for any first order graph property F. The proof essentialy uses compactness and Vaught's test. So, any first order property is either infinitely likely or infinitely unlikely for large graphs. Moreover, there is an algorithm which, given any first order graph property F as input, decides which of this possibilities holds for F (infinitely likely properties can be axiomatized by complete recursive first order theory). Questions. What about second order properties? More specificaly, what possibilities can be for probability of second order graph properties? Can we construct for any x from [0, 1] SO property with limit probability exactly x? What is the limit probability for connectedness of graph? Thanks for any answers and comments. 

Works by Montague show that natural language is not SO MUCH different from formal languages, its syntax and semantics has strong structure. You may say that they are semiformal. That is why we may apply all the techniques and results from mathematical logic, in which specificaly mathematical languages are formalized and deeply studied. As a result we have a field of formal theory of natural language and its aspects (grammar, semantics, development and so on). You may see the broad range of topics presented on this conference: $URL$ This opens the way for doing philosophy of language by formalizing the problems and answer them by mathematical proof. The work of Hilary Putnam presents attempts to tackle the problems of philosophy of mind and philosophy of language by comparing with formal models. To quote from his "Models and reality" paper: "In this paper I want to take up Skolem's arguments, not with the aim of refuting them, but with the aim of extending them in somewhat the direction he seemed to be indicating. It is not my claim that the "Lowenheim-Skolem paradox" is an antinomy in formal logic; but I shall argue that it is an antinomy, or something close to it, in philosophy of language. Moreover, I shall argue that the resolution of the antinomy - the only resolution that I myself can see as making sense - has profound implications for the greate metaphysical dispute about realism which has always been the central dispute in the philosophy of language." See his collected papers. Edward Zalta in his Principia Metaphysica has formalization of general notions of abstract and concrete objects. In mathematics (today) the most basic objects are sets. In Leibniz' Monadology (which is pure philosophical theory) they are monads. Zalta formalizes the monads and does Monadology formally. As well as Plato's theory of forms, theory of meinongian objects, theory of situations, the theory of worlds, theory of times. Moreover, Zalta claims that his formalization enables to obtain new useful abstract notions (objects) automaticaly by mechanized theorem proving. See his home page." 

This is an answer, but my insight is hardly a mathematical one. Nonetheless, here we go: The 1955 paper of Turán is, in fact, published in both English and Chinese in the same journal. The Chinese version is pages 411-417 in the journal; the English language version is pages 417 - 423. Turán writes: "I am pretty sure that on the way one can evaluate $M_n(6)$ or $S_n(6)$ after a little longer calculations and also further." But he doesn't give a formula. 

You could symmetrize an arbitrary function by averaging it over the symmetric group. Explicitly: take your favourite function $h$ in $n$ variables, and set $f(r_1, ..., r_n) = \frac{1}{n!}\sum_{\sigma} h(r_{\sigma(1)}, ..., r_{\sigma(n)})$ where the sum is taken over all permutations $\sigma$ of the numbers $1,...,n$. I'd love to hear of an example which isn't obtained by symmetrization! edit: heh. Any such example would be its own symmetrization. So I guess in some sense this is a complete, if overly glib, answer. 

I think it's a typo. It's probably rather more common than other typos, because the letters "t,h,g" are very close to each other on a standard keyboard. As a result, it actually does appear in the literature rather more often than you'd expect, and always without definition. (As such, I believe this post qualifies as a legitimate research question and shouldn't be closed, despite the fact that it's about a trivial typographical error. Hilarious!) For instance, here it is in a google books search result. It appears in the second page of an article in a collection of proceedings of a conference, without any definition. Elsewhere in the article it seems to be talking about orthogonality. Of course I'd be happy to be proven wrong - probably the best thing to do is to contact someone who's used the word in print. Maybe they know what it means. Edit: More evidence: compare the title to that of the pdf link, Also this: where the previous sentence uses the word "orthogonal") 

We shall define the infinitely-many-variable formal power series ring $A = {\Bbb F}_q[[X_1,\ldots,X_{\infty}]]$ over a finite field ${\Bbb F}_q$ as the following$\colon$ $A \colon= \underset{n \geq 1}{\varprojlim}\, {\Bbb F}_q[[X_1,\ldots,X_n]]$. For example, $\Sigma_{n = 1}^{n = \infty} X_n = X_1 + X_2 + \ldots \in A$. The ring $A$ is a non-noetherian local ring with the unique closed maximal ideal. I would like to pose the following theorem on which please let me know the correctness$\colon$ Theorem. $A$ is coherent. Proof. Let us fix a positive integer $l \geq 1$ and for an arbitrarily chosen elements $a_1,\ldots,a_l$ consider the linear equation $(*) \quad a_1Y_1 + \ldots + a_lY_l = 0 \quad (a_1,\ldots,a_l \in A).$ We shall define ${\mathrm M}_{\infty}$ as the set of the whole solutions of $(*)$ in the ring $A$. We shall show the finiteness of the number of generators of ${\mathrm M}_{\infty}$ as an $A$-module. We define ${\mathrm M}_{n,m}$ as the image of ${\mathrm M}_{\infty}$ in the quotient ring $A_{n,m} \colon= A/((X_1,\ldots,X_n)^m,X_{n+1},X_{n+2},\ldots)$. We have simply $A_{n,m} = {\Bbb F}_q[[X_1,\ldots,X_n]]/(X_1,\ldots,X_n)^m$. Lemma. For sufficiently large $n, m$, the $A_{n,m}$-module ${\mathrm M}_{n,m}$ has generators whose number is less than or equal to $l$. Proof. Obviously, ${\mathrm M}_{n,m}$ can be viewed as the subset of the whole solutions of the linear equation $(*)$ in the quotient ring $A_{n,m}$. But the whole solutions of the linear equation $(*)$ in the quotient ring $A_{n,m}$ has its cardinality less than or equal to $|A_{n,m}|^l$. Consequently we have $|{\mathrm M}_{n,m}| \leq |A_{n,m}|^l. $ When we view ${\mathrm M}_{n,m}$ as a $A_{n,m}$-module and set the number of the generators of ${\mathrm M}_{n,m}$ to be $\delta_{n,m}$, the following inequality holds$\colon$ $|(A_{n,m})^{*}|^{\delta_{n,m}} \leq |{\mathrm M}_{n,m}|. $ In short we have $|(A_{n,m})^{*}|^{\delta_{n,m}} \leq |A_{n,m}|^l.$ We can see the equality $|(A_{n,m})^{*}| = \frac{(q-1)}{q}|A_{n,m}|$ because $A_{n,m}$ can be divided into $q$ disjoint cosets as $c + {\frak m}$ with $c \in {\Bbb F}_q$ and ${\frak m}$ being the maximal ideal of $A_{n,m}$. Thus we obtain ${\delta_{n,m}} {\mathrm log}_e(\frac{(q-1)}{q}|A_{n,m}|) \leq l\,{\mathrm log}_e(|A_{n,m}|)$. So, we have ${\delta_{n,m}} \leq l \,{\mathrm log}_e(|A_{n,m}|)/{\mathrm log}_e(\frac{(q-1)}{q}|A_{n,m}|)$. When $n,m \to \infty$, we have $|A_{n,m}| \to \infty$, which ensures that the positive integer ${\delta_{n,m}}$ must be less than or equal to $l$ for sufficiently large $n, m$. Q.E.D. Now, by Lemma we can conclude that ${\mathrm M}_{\infty}$ has the set of generators with its cardinality less than or equal to $l$ as $A$-module because we have the equality ${\mathrm M}_{\infty} = \underset{n,m \geq 1}{\varprojlim} {\mathrm M}_{n,m}$, where all natural transition maps ${\mathrm M}_{n',m'} \to {\mathrm M}_{n,m}$ with $n' > n, m' > m$ are surjective. Q.E.D.
