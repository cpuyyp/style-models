Seek first to understand, then to be understood. You corrected the interviewer, without giving them a chance to fix the problem themselves. Given their reaction, I would indeed say that you probably blew the interview. Hopefully you've learned from this experience though. When faced with a question I cannot to answer exactly as posed, perhaps because it's an inappropriate personal question, I choose one of two routes. First I consider whether I can understand the underlying need, and fulfill that need with a slightly different response. In this case it's likely that they want to see if you accept that you'll make mistakes, that you own up to them, and that you fix them. Some people deny they ever made a mistake, or try to shuffle blame elsewhere, and this is often unacceptable. Many will simply limit the question to their professional life. It's still their life, and it's the only life the interviewer and business should concern itself about. "When I was in charge of serial numbers, I became aware of an overlap in numbers that would have caused some products to go out with duplicate serial numbers. I first identified which products were affected, and whether they were still in the factory. They were shown as not, but I checked shipping, and they were still in their boxes ready to be shipped. I relabeled them, then I went back and analyzed the reason it happened. If I had been more attentive I would have not allocated a series of numbers badly, and I changed the procedures so this error couldn't happen again regardless of my, or anyone else's, attentiveness." A second choice would be to examine the question in a non-confrontational way. While some may say it's impolite to answer a question with a question, it is actually a reasonable choice when you don't feel that you can answer the initial question. It is probably better than outright declaring that their question was terrible. Ask them a question that will give them an opportunity to reframe their question, and try to do it in a way that suggests you are asking for clarification, rather than accusing them, or refusing them. 

Again, ignore the personal attack and look at the root issue. "That's a good observation Joe, it seems at first glance that taking the path you suggest, X, Y, and Z, is better than the path I chose. I don't want to extend the length of the meeting for an in depth discussion but I have considered the other options and, in short, here are the two primary reasons I chose this direction... ... but if that's insufficient explanation I'd be happy to write an email about the decision and CC everyone to make sure I'm not going off the rails." 

You don't need to provide an explanation, but if they ask simply say, "I discovered that the position doesn't align with my current goals." Don't attempt an explanation in the letter. The paper is important as it sets the date in a way that they can't forget or deceptively claim you didn't give them notice. Since it's only been a week you can be nice and give them a few days notice, but honestly I'd use today's date, hand it in at the end of your shift, and leave. Please do not resign at the start of your shift - give them at least enough notice so they can get someone else in to replace you if you can't work your last shift. Don't hand it in before your shift and try to work that shift - I'd do that for a company I cared about, but this isn't a situation where you should be nice. Professional, yes, but nice, no. Don't worry about adding them to your resume, or using them as a reference. A week gap can be ignored easily - and if you worry about it, just use month/year in the resume, and don't put exact dates for work periods. If you feel the need to explain the job and why you left, a simple, "While I'm reluctant to badmouth former employers, let's just say that management had difficulty paying employees for all hours worked." Don't feel bad about leaving them. The manager has created a caustic environment, you should not be treated this way and you deserve a lot better. They will likely curse at you when you resign, and treat you worse than they already have. Ignore it, don't be tempted to give in to their verbal assault. If anything, being calm, collected, professional, and refusing to react to their idiocy will anger them more - which is always fun to watch. Even better, they may fire you on the spot. 

"Thanks for the suggestion, I'll consider it." These responses include and combine several techniques: 

You are experiencing a family emergency. While you are in the midst of it, it may seem like you might offend your boss or work by spending time with family during this important event. Don't worry about it so much. Not only do you have legal protections in most jurisdictions that allow you space and time to deal with such emergencies, you'll find most bosses and employers are very supportive during this sensitive time. They've not only worked with other employees through similar crisis, but often they've dealt with similar situations in their own life, and they'll have sympathy if not full empathy for your emergency. Keep your boss in the loop, but don't worry about providing detail or explicit timeframes. Indicate that you'll be back when the situation makes it suitable to return, and that you may be away from work for longer than you originally anticipated due to an unexpected response to being removed from the ventilator. If they give you any grief over your time off, when you return start looking for a new job, or discuss the situation with HR. It's not worth working for a company that doesn't understand that life is messy and supports employees through the bereavement process. In most cases, though, I expect you'll find they are very, very supportive and you have a lot of latitude, so don't worry too much about work right now - spend time with your family and let the grieving process happen. 

Now here's the hard thing I think you don't want to hear: His reactions don't come out of thin air. While this may be partially a personality conflict, I've found that a lot of these conflicts come when someone feels that another colleague is disrespecting or devaluing them. By showing them that you are listening, that you understand the issue they are bringing up, and that you value their feedback even if you've already chosen a different path, you validate them and their voice. This will often diffuse a remarkable number of tensions that exist between employees - just validating their thoughts and experience, and respecting their intelligence and wisdom. Yes, this is a two way street, and they should be giving you the same great treatment, but even if they don't the above should give you a lot of breathing room and comfort in your relationship with them even if they choose to continue to disparage you. Further, this has the exceptional benefit of making sure the rest of the team sees you as the reasonable, level headed person in all these conversations, and throws a bright light on who is responsible for the open conflicts if the other person doesn't ratchet down their emotional outbursts. Right now it's possible they view you both as difficult, but if you always act reasonably and treat the other person with a great deal of respect then when things come to a head you will simply be viewed more positively. Practise this and chances are things will be resolved over time. It takes a lot longer to cool tensions than it does to create them, so even if you could change your reactions over night, it will take weeks or even months for the general tenor of your relationship to change, but it will change and this general plan of action will benefit you throughout your career. 

First, learn from it. This is a great opportunity to learn how to work with liars and those with unethical business standards. The reality is that he may not even see this as a lie, but a simple negotiation tactic. The ethical foundation you two operate on may be so different that a confrontation will be about semantics rather than the issue at hand - your salary. So figure out how to deal with him, and figure out what he knows and does that you might be able to use in your business practices that doesn't violate your principles. Second, renegotiate. A few weeks after the move restart negotiations, and re-position yourself mentally to do so. Recognize that you have little to lose - all he can do is say no, and it's very unlikely that he'll fire you. While you don't need the money, you need to learn a few things about business - you now have more knowledge than you did last time you negotiated, and you may now be in a better position to obtain the raise, even without calling him out on his lies. 

Never provide the information over email. Use the wiki exclusively, link to it, refer to it, but never quote it or skip it. You will always have a few people who will never refer to the wiki. They won't be very productive, and if they are bothering you daily, then you should have a discussion with your boss to suggest they have a discussion with that worker's boss, to have a discussion with the worker about abusing internal resources when the wiki is available. Don't make it about being annoyed - suggest that every interruption is a distraction and you'd like to focus your attention on other aspects of your work, that they are wasting their own time in addition to yours for something that already exists. Others will eventually get so used to seeing the wiki with your links that they will eventually check it first. The biggest change from what you're doing now is 1) never give the answer in the email, always link to the wiki, and 2) always provide a link to the wiki and a reminder to bookmark it and check it first before emailing you. They know they're going to have to go to the wiki eventually, once you stop doling out answers in email, so they will get used to using it, and for some that will be enough. 

This should be seen as a big red flag, and at this point I'd strongly suggest looking elsewhere. You don't need to justify your salary expectation based on anything other than your skills and experience. The fact that they openly tell you that their offer depends on what you've made previously suggests either 1) they don't know your worth and are looking for outside confirmation or 2) they are not interested in paying your worth, only the minimum they can get away with. In either case the working environment is not likely to be a good one, as you'll probably be repeatedly asked to justify your value to the company. That said, I agree with others here who suggest that 1) you don't lie, and 2) you don't share your salary information in the first place. If you don't have the courage to say, "I'm not going to share my salary history with you, however I'm looking for a position with a salary of X." then you can usually pacify such requests with the following statement: 

There's no need to volunteer more information. If she really, really wants you to work on this project she will press for more explanation, and after a discussion it's possible you may come to an agreement you can both live with (that involves less contact with the other person, perhaps). If she's doing you a favor she will drop it immediately, unless she's a close friend and is really interested in helping you out financially - then she'll probably press for more info, but directed towards your financial state and what you plans are to rectify it.
