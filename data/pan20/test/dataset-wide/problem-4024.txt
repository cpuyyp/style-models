I get that the answer is "no" for an abelian variety over the algebraic closure of Fp with complex multiplication by a ring with a unit of infinite order. Since you say you have already thought through the abelian variety case, I wonder whether I am missing something. More generally, let X be any variety over the algebraic closure of Fp with an automorphism f of infinite order. A concrete example is to take X an abelian variety with CM by a number ring that contains units other than roots of unity. Any finite collection of closed points of X will lie in X(Fq) for some q=p^n. Since X(Fq) is finite, some power of f will act trivially on X(Fq). Thus, any finite set of closed points is fixed by some power of f. As I understand the applications to descent theory, this is still uninteresting. For that purpose, we really only need to kill all automorphisms of finite order, right? 

If there are infinitely many twin primes, then we can't do much better than $n/2$. If $q=2k-1$ and $p = 2k+1$ are primes, then the solutions to $x^2\equiv x \bmod pq$ are $0$, $1$, $k(2k-1) \approx (pq)/2 - \sqrt{pq}$ and $k(2k+1) \approx (pq)/2 + \sqrt{pq}$. 

Sorry, I gave a moronic answer before. Let me try to give a better one. There should be no expression for $f(\lambda) := \sum_{k \geq 1} \lambda^k/(k^2 k!)$ in elementary functions. If there were, then $g(\lambda) = \lambda f'(\lambda) = \sum_{k \geq 1} \lambda^{k}/(k \cdot k!)$ would also be elementary. But $g(\lambda)=\int_0^{\lambda} \frac{e^t-1}{t} dt$ and $e^t/t$ is a standard example of a function without an elementary antiderivative. 

I can achieve $t=2$, $n=21$, $|\mathcal{F}|=7$. Every pair from $\mathcal{F}$ is defeated by some other element on $11$ of the $21$ coordinates. For future answer's sake, I propose that we report these parameters as $(t,n,c,p) = (2,21,7,11/21)$. If I am not mistaken, this is the first $(2,n,c,p)$ anyone has reported with $p>1/2$. Take $G$ to be the $21$ element sub group of $S_7$ given by maps $\mathbb{Z}/7 \to \mathbb{Z}/7$ of the form $x \mapsto ax+b$, with $a \in \{ 1,2,4 \}$. Let $G$ act on $\mathbb{R}^7$ by permuting coordinates. Let $\vec{v} \in \mathbb{R}^7$ have strictly increasing coordinates and let $A$ be the $7 \times 21$ matrix whose columns are the $G$ orbit of $\vec{v}$. $G$ acts transitively on unordered pairs of distinct elements in $\mathbb{Z}/7$. So it is enough to check the claim for one unordered pair of coordiantes: Say $\{ 1,2 \}$. I find that, in $11$ of the $21$ columns of $A$, the $3$rd entry is greater than the first or second. I tried this idea with some other permutation groups that are weakly $2$-transitive but not strictly $2$ transitive, but it didn't work for any of the others. (The trouble with strictly $2$-transitive is that for any pair $f$, $g$ in $\mathcal{F}$, we wind up with $f$ and $g$ tied, and $\max(g,h)$ can only be better than $g$, so $f$ never beats $\max(f,g)$.) For the sake of more amusing conversations, I'll share the story I have in my head: This problem is about Arrow's voting paradox for $t$-faced candidates. Consider $n$ voters and $c$ candidates; the $i$-th coordinate of the $j$-th element of $\mathcal{F}$ is how well voter $i$ likes candidate $j$. If $t=1$, we are just pointing out that there may be no Condorcet winner. To imagine $t=2$, consider a $2$-faced candidate: when talking to voters who prefer $f$'s positions, she says what $f$ would say and, when talking to voters who prefer $g$'s positions, she repeats $g$'s slogans. The question is whether we can find a situation where every $2$-faced candidate loses to some sincere candidate (and by an overwhelming margin.) 

I can't give you a reference, but I can give you a quick proof. There is nothing special about $Gn(n,2n)$, so I'll prove it for $Gr(k,m)$. Consider the $\binom{m}{k}$ Plucker coordinates. One of them must be the largest; permute basis coordiantes such that $|p_{12\cdots k}| \geq |p_I|$ for every $I$. Work in the coordinate chart that looks like $\left( \mathrm{Id} \ X \right)$, for an $k \times (m-k)$ matrix $X$, we'll number the columns of $X$ from $k+1$ to $m$. Then $X_{ij} = (-1)^{k-i} p_{12 \cdots \hat{i} \cdots k j}/p_{12 \cdots k}$. So all the $|X_{ij}|$ are at most $1$. By the way, the other ratios $p_I/p_{123\cdots k}$ can be written as some minor of $X$, and vice versa, so you get in addition that every minor of $X$ has magnitude at most $1$. 

The search term here is "Invariant Theory", plus something like "algorithm" or "computational". The two standard books are Algorithms in Invariant Theory, by Bernd Sturmfels Computational Invariant Theory, by Harm Derksen and Gregor Kemper. I must admit that I haven't read either, although I can generally say that Bernd and Harm are both good writers. 

UPDATE This version is substantially improved from the one posted at 8 AM. I now think I can achieve $\mathbb{Z}/p$ using $O( \log p)$ vertices. I'm not trying to optimize constants at this time. Let $B$ be a simplicial complex on the vertices $a$, $b$, $c$, $a'$, $b'$, $c'$ and $z_1$, $z_2$, ..., $z_{k-3}$, containing the edges $(a,b)$, $(b,c)$, $(c,a)$, $(a',b')$, $(b',c')$ and $(c',a')$ and such that $H^1(B) \cong \mathbb{Z}$ with generator $(a,b)+(b,c)+(c,a)$ and relation $$2 {\large (} (a,b)+(b,c)+(c,a) {\large )} \equiv (a',b') + (b',c') + (c',a').$$ I think I can do this with $k=6$ by taking damiano's construction with $p=2$ and adding three simplices to make the hexagon $(h_1, h_2, \ldots, h_6)$ homologous to the triangle $(h_1, h_3, h_5)$. Let $B^n$ be a simplicial complex with $3+nk$ vertices $a^i$, $b^i$, $c^i$, with $0 \leq i \leq n$, and $z^i_j$ with $0 \leq i \leq n-1$ and $1 \leq j \leq k-3$. Namely, we build $n$ copies of $B$, the $r$-th copy on the vertices $a^r$, $b^r$, $c^r$, $a^{r+1}$, $b^{r+1}$, $c^{r+1}$ and $z^r_1$, $z^r_2$, ..., $z^r_{k-3}$. Let $\gamma_i$ be the cycle $(a^i,b^i) + (b^i, c^i) + (c^i, a^i)$. Then $H^1(B^n) = \mathbb{Z}$ with generator $\gamma_0$ and relations $$\gamma_n \equiv 2 \gamma_{n-1} \equiv \cdots \equiv 2^n \gamma_0$$ Let $p = 2^{n_1} + 2^{n_2} + \cdots + 2^{n_s}$. Glue in an oriented surface $\Sigma$ with boundary $\gamma_{n_1} \sqcup \gamma_{n_2} \sqcup \cdots \sqcup \gamma_{n_s}$, genus $0$, and no internal vertices. In the resulting space, $\sum \gamma_{n_i} \equiv 0$ so $p \gamma_0 \equiv 0$, and no smaller multiple of $\gamma_0$ is zero. We have use $3 + k \log_2 p$ vertices. This is the same order of magnitude as Gabber's bound. 

Alternate proof As above, reduce to $X$ smooth; let $\overline{X}$ be a normal crossing compactification; let $D = \overline{X} \setminus X$. Let $\eta$ be a $k$-form. The condition that $\eta$ is generated by $d \log$ forms implies that $\eta$ is an element of $H^0(\overline{X}, \Omega^k(\log D))$. The condition that $\eta$ is exact says that the image of $\eta$ in $H^k(X, \mathbb{C})$ is $0$. Conveniently, there is a spectral sequence $H^q(\overline{X}, \Omega^p(\log D)) \Rightarrow H^{p+q}(X, \mathbb{C})$ which degenerates at $E_1$. (I'm looking at Voisin's book, volume 1, Theorem 8.35, she cites Deligne Theorie de Hodge II.) So $H^0(\overline{X}, \Omega^k(\log D))$ injects into $H^k(X, \mathbb{C})$, which was the desired claim. Thomas Lam and I have finally started writing the paper where we needed this lemma; this is probably the proof we will use. 

Here is an algorithm, it may not be a good one. I will only explain how to find a basis $e_i$, $f_i$ such that $\langle e_i, e_j \rangle = \langle f_i, f_j \rangle =0$ and $\langle e_i, f_j \rangle = c_i \delta_{ij}$ for some constants $c_i$. I will punt on explaining how to make sure that $c_1$ divides $c_2$ which divides $c_3$ and so forth. This presentation is closely based on the algorithm in Wikipedia for computing Smith normal form. Find $e$ and $f$ so that $\langle e,f \rangle \neq 0$ (EDIT) and such that the lattice spanned by $e$ and $f$ is the intersection of the whole lattice with the vector space spanned by $e$ and $f$. Set $d := \langle e,f \rangle$. Complete $(e,f)$ to a basis $(e,f,g_1, g_2, \ldots, g_{2n})$ of our lattice. Case 1: We have $\langle e,g_i \rangle = \langle f, g_i \rangle =0$ for all $i$. Take $e_1=e$, $f_1=f$ and apply our algorithm recursively to the sublattice spanned by the $g_i$. Case 2: For all $i$, the integer $d$ divides $\langle e,g_i \rangle$ and $\langle f, g_i \rangle =0$. Replace $g_i$ by $$g_i - \frac{1}{d}\langle g_i, f \rangle e- \frac{1}{d}\langle e, g_i \rangle f.$$ We have now reduced to Case 1. Case 3: There is some $g_i$ so that $k:=\langle e, g_i \rangle$ is not divisible by $d$. Then, for some $q$, we have $0 < k-qd < d$. Set $f'=g_i-kf$ and $g'_i=f$. Then $(e,f',g_1,g_2,\ldots, g'_i, \ldots, g_n)$ is a basis, and $\langle e, f' \rangle$ is less than $d$. Return to the beginning with this new basis. Case 4: There is some $g_i$ so that $k:=\langle f, g_i \rangle$ is not divisible by $d$. Just like Case 3, with the roles of $e$ and $f$ switched. Since $d$ decreases at every step, eventually we will hit Case 1 and be able to reduce the dimension. 

I thought I'd write out the bounds we can get from the pigeonhole principle. Let's say that I am working with the primes $\leq P$, with polynomials of degree $D$ and I want the largest coefficient to be at most $K$. If $(K+1)^{D+1} > \prod_{p \leq P} p^p$, then this is possible by the pigeonhole principle: Just look at all polynomials of degree $D$ with coefficients in $[-K/2, K/2]$. Two of them must agree mod $p$ for all $p \leq P$; subtract them and win. We have $\prod_{p \leq P} p^p = \exp(P^2/2 + O(P^2/\log P))$, so this gives us roughly $K \approx \exp(P^2/(2D))$. If $D<P$, then we get a better bound by just using the pigeonhole for primes $\leq D$, and multiplying by $\prod_{D<p\leq P} p = \exp(P-D + O(P/\log P))$; the resulting bound is $K \approx \exp(D^2/(2D) + P-D) \approx \exp(P-D/2)$. I'll point out that $\prod_{p \leq P} (t^{p-1} - 1)$ is probably worse than we would get by using pigeonhole with $D = \sum_{p \leq P} p-1 \approx P^2/(2 \log P)$. Pigeonhole gives $K \approx \exp(\log P) \approx P$. Multiplying out those binomials produces $2^{P/\log P}$ terms, of $P^2/(2 \log P)$ different different degrees, so some degree has at least $2^{P/(\log P)}/P^2$ terms contirbuting to it. There is no reason to expect better then square root cancellation, so we probably get about $\sqrt{2^{P/(\log P)}}/P$, much worse than $P$. Editing note: I've removed some other computations which, after conversation with Andreas below, are clearly a dead end. That means the comments may not make much sense. 

You probably know this, but: Set $s(n) = \mu(1) + \cdots + \mu(n)$. Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that $s(n) = O(n^{1/2 - \epsilon})$. Then $$\sum s(n) \left( n^{-s} - (n+1)^{-s} \right)$$ would converge for $Re(s) > 1/2-\epsilon$. This would give an analytic extension of $1/\zeta(s)$ to this half plane, contradicting that $\zeta$ has zeroes on the critical line. So we know that the partial sums of $\mu$ are NOT $O(n^{1/2 - \epsilon})$. I don't know if this can be pushed to show that they are not $o(n^{1/2})$. 

As an example, let $X_t$ be three points in $\mathbb{P}^2$, at positions $(1:0:0)$, $(0:1:0)$ and $(1:1:t)$. This is certainly a flat family. Notice that the points are colinear when $t=0$ and not for $t \neq 0$. For $t \neq 0$, the homogenous ideal of $X_t$ is $$\langle xz-txy, yz-txy, z^2-t^2 xy \rangle$$ Let $Y$ be the closure of $\langle xz-txy, yz-txy, z^2-t^2 xy \rangle$ in $\mathbb{A}^3 \times \mathbb{A}^1$. If I haven't made any errors, the ideal of $Y$ is $$\langle xz-txy, yz-txy, z^2-t^2 xy, xy(x-y) \rangle.$$ Since I defined $Y$ as the closure of a flat family over a smooth one dimensional base, it is flat. For $t \neq 0$, the fiber $Y_t$ is the cone on $X_t$. However, at $t=0$, the fiber $Y_0$ is not the cone on $X_0$. They are the same away from the origin, but $Y_0$ has an extra nonreduced bit. Specifically, since $X_0$ lies on the line $z=0$, the cone on $X_0$ has $z$ in its defining ideal, while $Y_0$ has nothing in degree $1$. You can picture $Y_0$ as three coplanar lines, plus a nonreduced tangent vector pointing out the the $z=0$ plane; the cone on $X_0$ doesn't have that extra nonreduced piece. What may be confusing you is that there isn't some non-flat family here for me to point to. The family $Y_t$, which exists, is flat, but its fibers are not the cones on the $X_t$. There is no closed subfamily of $\mathbb{A}^3 \times \mathbb{A}^1$ whose fibers are the cones on the $X_t$. This is the general picture whenever you have a flat family in $\mathbb{P}^N$ which does not lift to a flat family of projective cones. 

A much shorter proof, though one that doesn't explain as much to me. From $P^T F P = r^2 G$, we deduce $P^{-1} = r^{-2} G^{-1} P^T F$ and thus $P^{-1} \in \frac{1}{r^2 \det G} \mathrm{Mat}(\mathbb{Z})$. But also $P^{-1} = \frac{1}{\det P} \mathrm{Adj}(P)$ so $P^{-1} \in \frac{1}{r^n} \mathrm{Mat}(\mathbb{Z})$. Since $GCD(r^2 \det G, r^n) = r^2$, we have $P^{-1} \in \frac{1}{r^2} \mathrm{Mat}(\mathbb{Z})$, as desired. 

It seems like, if solvable groups dominate everything else, then groups with a single $A_5$ factor and all other factors cyclic should likewise dominate every other type of nonsolvable group. 

In a comment above, marco asks whether this is true for larger $n$: That is to say, $M$ a complex $n$-fold, $R$ a totally real sub-real-$n$-fold and $\alpha$ a $(1,1)$-form on $R$. The answer is no for $n=2$. Basic reason: Suppose that $\alpha = \partial \bar{\partial} f$. Then $\alpha = d ( \bar{\partial} f)$, so $\alpha$ is exact. In particular, when $n=2$, we should have $\int_R \alpha=0$. Counter-example: Let $M = (\mathbb{C}^{\ast})^2$; write $w$ and $z$ for the coordinates on $M$. Our $R$ will be $|w|=|z|=1$. Our $\alpha$ will be $\frac{dw \wedge d \bar{z}}{w \bar{z}}$. So $$\int_R \alpha = \int_{|w|=1} \frac{dw}{w} \cdot \int_{|z|=1} \frac{d\bar{z}}{\bar{z}} = (2 \pi i) (- 2 \pi i) = - 4 \pi^2 \neq 0.$$ 

Minor observations: If $x$ is rational with non-prime power denominator, you certainly can't do much better. If $x = 1/6$, then $|x-p/q| \geq 1/(6q)$ for any prime power $q$. If $x$ is irrational, then Vinogradov showed that $\{ x q \}$ is equidistributed as $q$ runs over the primes. So, for any $\epsilon>0$, we can find a prime $q$ and an integer $p$ such that $|xq-p| < \epsilon$ or, in other words, $|x-p/q|<\epsilon/q$. I can't decide whether or not I think, for all irrational $x$, that there should be a prime $q$ such that $|x-p/q|<c q^{-2}$. (For some constant $c$ independent of $x$.) I definitely think it should be true except for $x$ of measure zero -- heuristically, the odds that a particular $q$ works are $2c/q$, and the sum $\sum 1/q$ diverges. 

The first is what you are using when you turn $x^2+y^2=1$ into $x^2+y^2=z^2$ and then $(z+y)(z-y)=1$; the corresponding change of coordinates is a symmetry of projective space which doesn't pass to affine space. The second is why homogenous polynomials work better for intersection theory: intersections can't run off to infinity. It is also why point counting over finite fields gives nicer answers in projective space: point counting is related to cohomology, and cohomology for smooth compact spaces obeys Poincare duality. 

Here is the best argument I can find. Let $A$ and $B$ be the coordinate rings of $X$ and $Y$. So our hypotheses are that $A \subseteq B$, with $A$ a normal domain and $B$ a domain which is finitely generated as an $A$-module. Let $K= \mathrm{Frac}(A)$ and $L = \mathrm{Frac}(B)$, so $L/K$ is finite. Let $x \in X$ and let $n = \# \pi^{-1}(x)$. We need to show that there is an open neighborhood $\Omega$ of $x$ so that $\# \pi^{-1}(x') \geq n$ for $x' \in \Omega$. We will be making frequent use of 

Here is my attempt: Set $g(\theta) = f(e^{i \theta})$. Lemma The Fourier coefficients of $g$ are $(\ldots, 0,0,0,a_0,a_1,a_2,\ldots)$. Proof: For $r<1$, we have $\frac{1}{2 \pi} \int_{\theta=0}^{2 \pi} f(r e^{i \theta} )e^{- n i \theta} d \theta = a_n$. Since $f$ is differentiable on $\bar{\Delta}$, it is continuous; since $\bar{\Delta}$ is compact, $f$ is uniformly continuous on $\bar{\Delta}$. So it is valid to interchange integration and limit in $$\lim_{r \to 1^{-}} \int_{\theta=0}^{2 \pi} f(r e^{i \theta} e^{- n i \theta} ) d \theta $$ and conclude that $$\int_{\theta=0}^{2 \pi} f(e^{i \theta} e^{- n i \theta} ) d \theta = a_n.$$ $\square$ Now, the missing part. I want to claim that $g$ is not just differentiable. but $C^1$. If so, then a theorem of Dirichlet states that $g$ is the sum of its Fourier series, as desired. But now that I think about it, $g$ doesn't need to be $C^1$. Unless I have missed something, $f(z) = (z-1)^2 e^{1/(z-1)}$, as a function on $\bar{\Delta}$, is differentiable at $z=1$ (with derivative $0$) but not continuously so. You might think about whether "differentiable" or "$C^1$" is the condition you really want. If you really want just differentiable, I'd start by looking up the counterexample of a function which is differentiable but whose Fourier series doesn't converge. My guess is that it won't be too hard to extend that example to the interior of $\Delta$. 

$\def\ZZ\mathbb{Z}$Question 1: No. Let $C>1$. I will show that there are only finitely many $f(x)$ in $\ZZ[x]$ so that $|f(n)| \leq C^n$ for all $n \in \ZZ_{\geq 0}$. Choose $d$ large enough that, for all $k>d$, we have $k! > 2 C^k$. I claim that a polynomial with $|f(n)|<C^n$ is determined by its values on $0$, $1$, ..., $d$. Suppose, to the contrary, that $f(n) \neq g(n)$ but that they agree for $0 \leq n \leq d$. Let $k$ be the first integer where $f$ and $g$ disagree. So $f(x)-g(x)$ is divisible by $x(x-1)(x-2) \cdots (x-k+1)$, so $f(x) - g(x) = x(x-1) \cdots (x-k+1) h(x)$ for some $h$ with integer coefficients. So $f(k) - g(k) = k! h(k) \equiv 0 \bmod k!$. But, by assumption, $|f(k)|$ and $|g(k)| < C^k < k!/2$. So it is impossible that $f(k) \neq g(k)$ and $f(k) \equiv g(k) \bmod k!$. This contradiction concludes the proof. Question 2 is still stumping me.
