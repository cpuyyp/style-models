I actually organised my own exit interview, writing a mail to say that since I knew I would leave the company, I started thinking more critical about the company and was convinced this lead me to some insights that could help the company. This lead to a meeting in which I explained they had hired me for â‚¬500 more than I expected, but never offered me the opportunities I was looking for because I was too expensive to do this in a junior roll for some time. If they had paid me less and given me these opportunities, I would have had a great career with them. Finally I advised them to ask for the motivation of a senior candidate, even if they already know they want to hire him. 

I had a similar issue once. I wanted an important document from my manager. I planned ahead, I needed it after two month, but within one month I had no answer. So I friendly asked for the state of the matter via mail. Turned out that sth. got mixed up, he politely apologized and after some days I got my documents. You should try the same. It sure will work out. Provided that the the delay is not intended from your manager, if it is, you will notice it in the way he answers. Maybe you should put a second person in CC to have some kind of proof that the mail didn't get 'lost'. 

If you are located near the new employees you can have them pickup a hard copy of the login information. You will just need to let the manager know that it is ready. If there is a great distance between you and the employees, you will have to email the manger the credentials. This is to let them give the credentials to the new employee. I worked for a place that tried to tell you to pickup the passwords by leaving a voice mail. They also sent you an email to tell you your voice mail was now enabled. Needless to say that method didn't work very well for new employees. I also sent credentials to a manger once because the employee wouldn't try to login. They told their manager they never got them. After 4 or 5 cycles of creating a new temporary password and sending it out, they miraculously arrived after I also sent them to the manager. 

If the ethics of your company are more related to the former point. You should probably get out. Preferably in peace since your boss could be reference for future applications. You shouldn't mention that your boss is an addict, unless maybe he's is getting help and had some kind of 'outing', since it could be considered as deceitful. If the second point is the case, you should document the behaviour of your boss to be safe against future threats and then confront him with your concerns. E. g. you don't want to drive in the same car. Depending on his actions, you should maybe take lawyer. 

I often do investigate these opportunities. I start by asking why he links me to the company. Even if I am still convinced the person missed the point on my ambitions or the job content, I might try to get an interview, for instance to identify other opportunities in the company. The enthusiasm of the intermediary is a good excuse to go for an interview in spite of an incomplete match. Whether you went for an interview or not, always give feedback to the intermediary. Name what matched and what did not. It helps him or her to be more selective and motivates to stay alert. And last but not least, these leads might inspire to broaden your own search or even consider a career switch. But keep your own objectives in mind. Dare to say no after an interview and dare to explain a relative or friend he got it wrong, but do this politely and constructively. You can say "No", but say add the "thanks". 

So ask him for advice via mail, ask for some basic approaches that enable you to fix the problem yourself. That should be sufficient for now. Maybe he will open up in future! 

Address this issue. If you don't clarify it, your boss will bit by bit develop a picture of you being lazy, not caring about the company, etc... Have a talk with him and tell him you have the feeling that there is a misunderstanding. Explain the reasons why you want to be home earlier - preferably kids and wife, and not to watch the new episode of xyz - and show him that you care about the company. Have some facts to back it up, quality of work, you always do your time despite going home earlier. But be cautious not to degrade your colleagues, when you talk about the working hours! 

Until you get the offer in writing, there is no offer. The advice is to never quit the current job until you have returned the signed written offer back to the new company. Even if you don't have an old job, you have to know that there is no agreement until that offer is signed. 

Offer relocation: They will pay some or all of your moving expenses. They can offer a fixed amount, they can offer actual expense, or they can offer actual expenses up to a limit. In some cases they can actually help make arrangements including offering a period of time in corporate housing. Some will even pay for a trip to the new city to house hunt. Depending on the extra benefits they offer, there can be tax implications. Also the more they pay the more likely there will be requirement for you to stay with the company for a minimum amount of time, or you will have to pay them back. Watch the tax rules regarding minimum distance of the move and the number of months you have to stay and work in the new location, or what you though was free help could be taxable. Offer Visa Sponsorship They will help you get a Visa to work in this country. They may also help a family with the paperwork to move to this country. They may be tolerant of the starting date because they know that a Visa takes time. There will be requirements regarding how long you are expected to work for them, in addition to any legal requirements regarding work rules. Difference They are mutually exclusive. 

Always get as much "buy in" from the employer as possible before telling something that could scare him/her off. Never mention it in a first contact. Never tell it before the person at the other side of the table has really spent time on you. Once the interviewer discovered your added value, such as relevant skills not mentioned in the job requirements, once she/he is considering how to use these strong points, dropping you because of a disadvantage means invalidating all the effort done so far. That is the time to come forward with an issue like yours. Unless you decide to wait even longer, until your contract is signed. If you can hide the problem and be productive for some weeks, you might even wait until you proved your value once or twice, but then you must be quite sure you can mitigate the problem with not too much special measures. 

If those sites have means to leave personal notes. You could write something along with the update like 'Had a greate time @ X, Now starting a new stage @ Y'. I see similarities to updating your relationship status on social networks. There are people who update the status on the same day, others who wait some month and the third type that never updates these information. If you want to keep the world informed, I would always tend to option 2. Wait till you are certain of the job/relationship and then share it with the world. Because not everybody needs to know, e g. if you quit a week after. If you are comfortable with people knowing everything, and do not think about loosing your face, then you could even post it on the same day. But make sure to write along some conciliating personal notes like mentioned above. 

If there is something with your profile that needs to be taken into account before taking a position, that would scare off employers, I advice going through a trusted recruiter. Recruiters are engaged to by employers seeking for hard-to-find profiles. Their added value is to look further and deeper into candidates. It is a competitive advantage fort them to be unprejudiced and find candidates others would neglect. Due to my autism, I have problems discussing IT related issues with non technical people and I am reluctant to take the lead of a team. As a software engineer, after updating my linked-in profile, I was regularly contacted by the same recruiters. I consistently asked questions to know what communication would be required. Soon I selected two recruiters that used to give clear answers to these question and posed relevant questions in return. I acknowledged them for identifying interesting opportunities for me and proposed having a face to face discussion about my profile, in which I told them about my condition, the problems it had caused in the past and the way I use to mitigate them. They kept sending me interesting offers. 

In most companies with a defined salary structure the position will have a range of salaries that the company is willing to pay somebody for each position. We have to assume that the work location, the team, and the position description are acceptable to the employee. We also have to assume that the benefit package for the new position is essentially unchanged. If these assumptions aren't true then negotiating the pay and benefits is a compactly different issue. Assuming the current position isn't going away and the new position was advertised, then the employee should have already determined if the minimum salary advertised is acceptable. If there is overlap between the current salary and the band the new position pays, the employee has to decide what is minimum percentage increase they are willing to accept. Because this is an internal switch the salary for the new position would have been a question I would have asked during the interview. But since that wasn't already discussed that would be a question I would ask now. If it isn't acceptable, and you are willing to lose the new job, then don't sign and try to negotiate. If the current position is going away, then you don't have a lot of leverage you will probably have to settle for the minimum of the band, or some small increase in salary if the bands overlap.
