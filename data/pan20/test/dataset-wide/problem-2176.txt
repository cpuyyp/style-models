Part of your approach depends on if this actually a requirement for the job, from the hiring company's perspective. If this isn't a hard requirement, you could say "I haven't yet worked with that particular technology, but I have read and learned about it. I am interested to work on this technology." Then, you could go on to tell them what you have learned in your reading, and how it relates to the position you are trying to fill. If you have used this technology on your own, talk about that too. If this is a real requirement for the company, you may simply not fit their needs. Not every company is in a position to allow their new hire to learn important technology on the job. But sometimes what is expressed as a requirement, is really just a nice-to-have. Your other skills and attributes may make up for your lack of knowledge in this area. Good luck! 

Quote possibly. As a hiring manager, I always want to hire folks who will be around for a while. This is important, since I invest a lot of time and money in people on my team - in salary, in benefits, and (particularly for new folks) in training. I'd like to think that these people will be around long enough that they come up to speed and thus pay back the investment. If these were professional jobs (rather than just part-time or summer jobs while you were in college full-time) your background unfortunately shows a pattern that would make such an investment a waste of my time and money. Given that, I might well throw out your resume, unless your positives far outweighed this negative. That said, there are always exceptional circumstances. And certainly the specific needs of the hiring manager may outweigh the job-hooping your resume shows. Often, you can address just this point in a really good cover letter. Show the hiring manager how great a fit you are, and indicate how you want your next job to be one that is a keeper. Be prepared to address this issue during the interview process and explain how this time it will be different. And make sure you find a great fit before you accept a job, so that it will truly be different this time. It only takes one manager who gives you a great job, to get you off the the many-jobs-in-a-few-years path. 

You simply should never be asking for things to do "every half-hour to an hour". That is far too frequently and makes no sense. Three things: 

Hopefully, you already have a good relationship with your boss. Go to her/him and say something like "Hey, boss. This is a really difficult decision for me, and I want to make sure I get this right, career-wise. I've really enjoyed working with you, and I really appreciate the offer. I think you can understand that I'd like to wait a bit before giving you my answer. Can I get back to you in X weeks?" Often, that will work. Employers of interns know how this end game plays out. They clearly like you, and would like your commitment to join them. Sometimes your current employer will just be trying to add you into the mix after a successful internship. They will expand their headcount to include you, should you accept. But other times, they have you earmarked to fill a position that must be filled at a particular point in time (in order to complete a project, or start a new one, etc). If that is the case, they may need an answer sooner than later, so that they can pursue other candidates in the event that you decline their offer. You might have to make a difficult decision with incomplete information - so it goes in the working world. With interns I've hired, I have encountered both situations. Some interns have accepted my offers, others have declined. If they were good workers, they always got great recommendations anyway. A quick discussion with your boss should get things moving in the right direction one way or another, and will likely get you your desired positive recommendation in either case. 

Most people don't have the same upbringing you had. And (perhaps consequently?) most people don't have the same outlook on work and life that you do. Most people I know aren't so stressed out after work that they don't do anything but play mindless games. For me, that never happened. Most people I know find at least some parts of their work rewarding. For most of my career, I have found my work very rewarding. Most people I know have a social life that they enjoy, at least part of which is at work. That has always been the case for me. Most people I know are capable of living full, enjoyable lives despite the normal demands of work. Perhaps it's just maturity (sometimes new graduates feel this way until they have adjusted to the working world). Perhaps it's upbringing. Perhaps it's just personality. Perhaps you just haven't found the right job or career that would be sufficiently rewarding. Perhaps you need to consider alternate job styles where you have more time off (such as contracting). Perhaps you need some counselling to deal with personal/emotional/physical issues. "how do people live full, enjoyable lives?" Most do. Some do so immediately, others take a while and have to experiment with different careers/jobs/job styles to get there. It's hard for some young folks who haven't ever had any real-world work experience to get it right the first time. Some never do. 

In my part of the world, this is very typical and completely ethical. If you are using a company card, then the company gets the rewards (if any). But if you are obligated to (or encouraged to) use your own card, then you are entitled to any subsequent rewards. Some folks (often Sales people) end up with significant rewards points as a result of using their personal cards for travel, accommodations, and expenses. To me this seems quite fair as the company is getting the benefit of not having to administer company cards. Most companies have written guidelines for these situations. See if your company does as well. If not, ask HR or Accounting about their reimbursement policies. 

I'm not sure I agree with the premise behind that statement. It sounds more like what a college buddy might say, than what someone who had your career progression in mind might say. You don't need your manager's permission to quit. So if you feel strongly that you need to take a summer break after 5 months of full-time work, then you always have the option of leaving. If I were your manager (and I cared about your career), I'd advise against it. It's what some call a "career-limiting move". 

You've already responded to HR and explained the discrepancy, so there's nothing to do here except perhaps check in with HR again and see if they need something more. But you should immediately update your resume with the 2010 graduation date to avoid this issue going forward. 

I'm guessing that it's rather unlikely that you end up getting an offer now, so I doubt that you really need to worry about that. But would you really feel "diminished" by getting an offer? Why? Isn't an offer for a job you apparently wanted good enough? Everyone is different, and we each own our personal feelings. Some would feel challenged by this scenario. Some would think "I know I wasn't your first choice, but I'm going to work hard and show you that you got lucky by eventually landing me." But if instead you feel that you must be "loved the most" by a company that hires you, then simply pass if you ever get an offer. Look for a different company that will love you best (or at least won't be honest about your not being the first choice). 

You know they looked at it. So sending an email asking if they "properly" looked at it would be rather foolish. Don't be a nag. Try to be more patient. It was only 3 days ago and one of the days wasn't even a work day. 

At the beginning of the interview, ask your interviewer "Do you mind if I take notes while we chat?" Then proceed based on the answer you get. Even if you do take notes, pay careful attention to what is being said and asked rather than attention to your notes. You don't want to be distracted by trying to record everything. And if you aren't able to jot quick notes while listening attentively, then don't. 

Sometimes you need to do what you believe is right, even if you suspect you might have to bear the consequences. We all face times when we know that stark honesty might be somewhat costly. We need to weigh in our own minds if that cost is worth being dishonest or not. You were honest. Hopefully, that honesty worked out for you. Perhaps not in that particular job (which you may not have wanted anyway), but perhaps in another job that met your requirements. 

It's a waste of time. Those that tend to clean up after themselves will do so. Those that don't tend to clean up after themselves will see the sign, perhaps clean up once, then resume their habits. Eventually, the sign will get dirty and people won't even notice that it's there. Consider having people in the office take turns on "cleanup duty" where once per week they clean the kitchen. Eventually, the people who don't clean up after themselves will have their turn cleaning up the mess of others. It still won't likely change many habits, but at least the kitchen gets cleaned weekly. 

Put it on your resume - I don't see how it could hurt. It could even be a point of discussion during your interview. If an interviewer asks about this certification, you could talk about it's value, indicate that it must be sponsored and find out if the new employer would be willing to do so. At best, you'll be sponsored. At worst, you'll learn something about your new employer and have a discussion about what is important there, and what is not. That's always a good thing. Overall, listing a certification that you currently hold isn't misleading. Many certifications need to be renewed or they lapse. 

Write a better script for the folks taking these calls to use to help customers through resetting their passwords. If you actually have to see what they are doing, then your process is too difficult (for you and likely for your customers). You may need to spend some time simplifying it. Perhaps a written How To document with pictures that you could send to customers would speed things up. Alternatively, outsource these calls to a facility with more capacity or bring on some temp workers until the requests die down. You call this "an automated password reset feature that works". While it might work functionally, your customers seem to be hinting that it doesn't work for them. Somewhere along the line you seem to have an ease-of-use issue. You might be well served to find out why it doesn't meet their needs, so you can improve the feature next time. I'm also guessing that you didn't perform any Beta testing of this new feature to see how your customers actually handle it in the wild. That might be something you want to consider for the next time around. A few dollars invested in professional testing might have prevented this situation. 

No. That's a waste of your time, and a waste of their time. Employers aren't interested in why you left. The time to discuss this was while you were there, before you decided to leave. Once you have decided to leave, just do so with a minimum of chit-chat about why. Leave on professional terms, and there won't be any repercussions. 

Perhaps. If you strongly feel that you need to be an expert in something in order to be happy/successful, then you might have made a mistake. Not everyone feels this way. 

You can start by avoiding words like "scummy", "fudge", "hoard", "goalpost-moving" and "my unwilling participation". Instead, focus on what your superiors hope to achieve and how you think they can best get there. Or you could request a meeting with the board and say that you feel it is unfair to "change the criteria going forward so that bonus attainment will be less". Perhaps you can propose an alternative process that will still let the company have it's desired 33% bonus attainment rate. It's often good to have an alternative when you express a complaint. The company I recently worked at has a performance appraisal system tied to annual salary increases. The department I managed was given a budget for the increases prior to the appraisals and could not be adjusted. Thus, the dispersal of increases was a zero-sum game. If I had all terrific workers on my team, I couldn't given them all terrific increases. I had to give less to one in order to be able to give more to another. Or I had to give everyone an "average" raise. I argued unsuccessfully for several years that is was unfair and that the budget should be spread across more than one (small) department. I didn't have to be personally happy about it, but I still had to follow orders and stay within my budget. In your case it doesn't sound like you are being asked to judge people individually. Instead, it sounds like you are being tasked with coming up with a "passing grade" such that 33% of people attain their bonus. And it sounds like someone (with an analytics role) would have to do that anyway. If you really have a moral objection, you can argue your point. But in the end you need to decide if this is sufficiently morally objectionable that you would quit or not.
