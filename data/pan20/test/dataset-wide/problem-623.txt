Front with a lockout for better friction on the road. rear's good for fast downhill, otherwise get a soft seat or one with a shock right underneath it. diff? front is in the fork; back is built t 45 into the frame. 

All the high-end MTB, and road racers seem to have somewhere between ... 6 and 12 gears. NO derailleur up-front, only a few to scroll through in back. I get the KISS principle behind it; I like having first gear made extra-extra large to make up for missing lower gear elsewhere. Seriously why is this so popular? All the $5000+ bikes have ONE deralleur and limited gears. Is it really better to design gearsets this way? Why? Is it faster? More durable? 

it is necessary to to slow down the rate at which you pedal (I suppose we must create a differential, in terms of pedaling) in order to get the derailleur to shift. The differential must increase (in velocity--> accelerate) in order to downshift; it must slow-down to shift up. if you've ever been cruising on a flat and up-shift; you may notice a delay between your shift and the ACTUAL shift...because you're pedaling, so what is the hold-up, right? most gears not shift gears until there is at least some change in velocity; nee the relative power we deliver to the pedals. same with hitting a steep driveway unexpectedly -- it's hard to downshift fast enough to deliver enough power (angular accel) to the pedals and thus downshift. usually I run out of velocity and have to jump off the bike if im blindsided by an unexpected steep-spot. sadly, I need to be going at least 1km/hr in order to maintain balance without a 3rd point of contact. it may seem to you like it is stalling, when really the system is waiting on the differential described. as reference - my system is an 18-speed - 2 up front, 6 in the back hybrid. the rear derailuer is brand new (and had to be custom made by shimano) -- I ate it hard and snapped the original. 

shiny & waterproof external material is reflective Frequently; it is worn in conjunction with fluorescent yellow While walking; the reflective orange is visible 

This is ideal both for flight decks, tarmacs, airfields and anywhere where its (a) dark and (b) moving vehicles use flashlights or headlights. In my case; I was walking through a crosswalk; on a flat; it was a clear night (infinite visibility) and due to my stride+jacket; the orange material AND reflective blue were visible to any class C (the lowest driver clearance). THIS driver was in his late 80s; clearly the California DMV was in dereliction of duty; as well as his ins. company; whom I've settled with so I won't libel. The elderly 'gentleman' hit me with his white Infinity Q45v doing 40mph. ****injuries follow**:** 

Hope this ins't a repeat ...but FIXIE. Simple, fast, cheap and fun -- you cant go wrong; unless you fail to get a U-lock. FIXIE is the "KISS Simple" answer for my SE brothers out there who took took software req'm't's in college (!!!!) xD 

I'm trying to get my front derailleur to stop rubbing in the high gears, smallest sprockets. To do this I am attempting to follow this guide by shimano: $URL$ It says that when in the largest chainring it should be possible to adjust the derailleur so that it is 0-0.5mm aways from the largest chainring on the side furthest away from the bike. This however is not possible and seems to have been set by the lbs simply by putting the cable at very high tension to push it over so it doesn't rub. I believe this may be slipping or stretching and causing the rub to return. What's the correct way to do this? Is this normal or is the derailleur being dysfunctional? 

I am doing a cycle tour of Japan starting from Fukuoka and ending in Tokyo. I will be flying with the bike and as my start and end points differ I will not have the opportunity to use a box (unless anyone has any ideas?). I will most likely use one of these bags and I have been told by the airline that nothing is necessary by way of packing the bike but I would naturally like to see my bike in one piece at the other end. The bike is a Specialized Tricross with disc brakes. Does anyone have any pointers as to the safest way to package something like this. I think I will definitely take the rear dÃ©railleur off and wrap bubble wrap along the length of the bike to protect the wheels, pedals etc but other than that I'm not sure what lengths to go to. Does anybody have any experience or ideas? 

After a loose bottom bracket and some prevailing knee pain I have made a few adjustments to the bike. I have managed to greatly reduce the pain in my left knee but the right still has some pain. I have noticed that since the bottom bracket came loose that my right foot if positioned the same as my left will knock against the crank arm. I have to perch my foot on the edge of the pedal. I'm not sure whether this is something that could be attributed to a bending of the crank arm or something else? 

It's supposed to be on the outer casing (according to the shimano manual) but the Tricross has internal cable routing. Anyone know where it is? I really don't see it but I might be being a bit simple. 

Every time the right pedal goes over the top I get a single clack noise with a little more 'travel', a point where the bottom bracket moves without any resistance, from that point in the rotation. I have only just noticed it recently and it seems to be more noticeable on the lower gears where the cogs are smaller. Any thoughts on what to do or what might be causing the problem? 

First off given that I will be sightseeing as well is it worth the extra weight to take a dedicated cycle shoe and a walking shoe or is the extra hassle of having something else that can go wrong not worth it? I'm wondering what are some good combinations of pedal and shoe for touring. Should I go for a dedicated touring pedal like the A520/A530? I don't know anything about shoes so some recommendation would be good there as well. I will be touring japan in the summer so it will be warm but still possibly quite wet. Finally, how hard is a pedal/shoe combo to set up correctly for comfort? Is it something that's worth getting done in a shop? I have a good LBS and they will most likely do a basic set up for free. 

Other than having been a serious rider, having owned/fixed-up/sold/bought about 30 or 40 bikes in the past few years...I'd be useless buying or selling even 1 bike. how would the average consumer know if they have "a valuable bike" due to quality/brand/options... and-or bikes that are out-of-production and go up due to supply & demand? Car consumers have the kelley blue book. bikes don't tell you mileage -not nearly as definitively as an odometer in a vehicle. As example, the most valueble bike I ever owned/sold was an E-Moto, the company is defunct. This lightweight mtn bike had a 12v battery, power front & rear disc brakes, it even delivered electricity to the derailleur. The bike was to be marketed to Japanese commuters. It folds up like a brief-case! the company being defunct, the high-tech features and usefulness make it a fav. amoung collectors. I first got acquainted w/ a townie because my associate was using one for his daily-rider. it was an electra, with 24-speeds (no longer made, design or gearset)...to the untrained eye it is an avg. hybrid, but I know it's worth well >$1000 and the E-Moto, though we sold for $3000-- couldve fetched higher. It was also 2012 - that bike could be worth $8 to $10k. how do the people that don't eat, sleep and breathe bikes [the way we do] know when they are getting a good deal ... or the shaft? 

From personal exp. (yes I understand this is anecdotal...) I like to wear "flight jackets" this is the same jacket a pilot would wear or a cover-all worn on a flight deck. it is functional for the following three reasons: 

Looks like a Backward Circle Fixie. It seems the previous owner swapped out the tires/wheels, possibly painted it and/or added a decal, which to me, made it seem like a GT, but I'm not sure if GT even manufactures fixies. I didn't dig too deeply to find and snap this off the Web. The crook in the frame is unmistakable. update to research the logo on the front in your pic is a dead-wringer for the logo on their site. if it's not a BC, then it is a damn-good knock-off (though I don't see the point in that crook other than aesthetic-value). plz note--detractors to my answer fail to explain the "Backwards" logo, seen on op's photograph -- if I am wrong, then someone went WAY overboard to make it LOOK like a BC (the logo is visible, as it is on most bikes in the front of the "handle" portion of the front-fork; just below the handlebar). update to research pt. 2 "re-research" see comment (2) by ojd -- this crooked shanker design was apparently ripped off by other fixie manufacturers. Still I'm confident I've id'd this ride correctly., so I'm not changing/removing any portion of the answer, but I AM adding this notation; giving the writer credit and acknowledging that I might be wrong (sadly, it does happen sometimes). OP - plz do inform us once you hammer this one down! 

A theory: There is some damage or debris on the inside of your tire. A second theory is slightly out of position rim tape. A third theory is your technique may be leading to a pinch flat. Questions to help diagnose: When you switch between tire sets, does the flat happen only going to one set of tires? Or does it happen no matter which tire? If it's just one tire set, then inspect the inside carefully for debris or other issues. Next time the tire is off, look at the rim tape carefully and run a finger along it. It should be smooth and sturdy. You may also want to check that it's secure all the way around. If it is moving around during tire changes it could be exposing a spoke nipple. The third theory would be that if the tire it tight or tough to get on then perhaps you are pinch flatting during the tire change. Advise here is to go carefully... 

Some of the physics are simple. To move an object of mass m up an incline requires an amount of work proportional to the weight. This is the mass times the gravitational acceleration times the displacement W = m g d. So for the heavier bike it requires more work. It also requires more average power to lift it over the same rise in a fixed set of time. But if in your experiment with the same weights are then this physical effect is not there, it is just perception, or another physical phenomenon. Also this is limited to climbing. The angular acceleration of your wheels is a factor as you are accelerating. As you apply torque to increase the angular velocity of the wheel, the moment of inertia is a factor. This is basically an accounting of how much mass and how far away it is from the axis. Think of a figure skater spinning with their arms out and then pulling them in to spin faster. Gravity on the wheels is a separate consideration, described above. Another physical phenomenon at play could be aerodynamic drag. In the simplest models, this is proportional to the cross sectional area, velocity squared, and drag coefficient. Some say a heavier bike with better aerodynamic performance performs more efficiently overall. Given the combined weight with the rider this could be true at sufficient speeds. Finally there could be a variety of fit factors on the lighter bike that make it feel easier and more efficient to you. It may even be that the fit puts you in a more aerodynamically advantageous position. But you will feel better on a properly fitted bike. Try the new bike with the old wheels and a loaded bag. If it still feels faster, it must be because it fits you better. 

Avoid taking the seatpost with you if you expect rain. Rain will get into the inside of the frame, and pool down in the bottom bracket. This will soon lead to a very squeaky bottom bracket. I would refine the comment above: the drivetrain should be both well lubed and dry (no water and no oil). An oily or greasy chain is a magnet for dirt and wears much faster. It's also probably worth trying to see if you can find a way to store your bike indoors at the office. One day in the rain won't hurt your bike too bad, but continuous storage outdoors will add up. Be sure to clean that drivetrain often as you ride in the wet. -Jb
