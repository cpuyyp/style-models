Unfortunately this is common in finance startups. I know it well because I was in finance. The finance startups can do that because: 

PhD hurts your job seeking. It's a shame to add it to a non-academic resume, so don't do that. You're not legally required to tell anybody about your PhD degree. Everybody does that. In the industry, nobody cares if you have a PhD title (they care if you have criminal records). It won't show up in background check because nobody cares. 

As an employee, your works are property of the company. It's nice if you could add your name onto the paper, but the company doesn't have any obligation. Unless the company defaulted on paying you, you have no control over your company's assets. It's not your paper, you were paid to work on it. It's like a programmer being hired for writing code. Good job for your works on the publication, but that doesn't mean you deserve any credits other than what already stated in your employment contract (e.g. salary). Please don't do anything silly. Your behaviour is close to stealing company's assets. Don't go into that. No, you shouldn't ask for your name because it’s not your paper. 

I have no idea of your background, because it all depends on your skill sets and your bargaining power. In academics (e.g. computer scientist at PhD level), visa sponsorship is awfully common. That make sense because the job is really not something that everybody can do. In IT, you will need have very strong background history to convince visa sponsorship. UK, France, Germany and Australia have enough candidates for entry to middle level positions. You will need to prove yourself (more likely a senior position). If you did have the skills set, consider headhunters. Headhunters work with top clients (e.g. investment banking), those companies will more than happy to sponsor you if they believe you are unique. Answer You are free to ask for visa sponorship for any job position that you are qualfiied. However, expect rejection unless you have strong unique skills not available in the local market. 

I don't see anything wrong. That's not your coworker's properties, everything belongs to the company. You're free to do whatever you want and exploit the company's assets to your advantage. Yes, don't need to ask, just do it. The management will be appreciated. You're not being rude, you're just doing your job. 

Sorry, working overtime in highly competitive places like Singapore is very common. You are not alone as many Asian cities like Hong Kong, South Korea and Japan are like that. There is nothing suspicious in your question. Working until the next day is not unusual, something that the Europeans here don’t understand. It’s part of the Asian working culture. You are expected to work as long as your body can physical capable of. It will get better once you move into more senior position. Unfortunately, if you don’t obey you are not considered as employable. For your records, my Asian friends would frequently work until 3 or 4 am just before the deadline. Your situation is not as bad as you might think. The Singapore law allows you to say NO. You don’t have to work overtime if you really insist. But ... prepare for pressure, revenge and anger from your team as you're breaking the working culture and trust. It’s bad if you are the only one leaving home early when the whole team stay late. Again, working late is absolutely expected in Asia. Choose: 

There's nothing to worry here. It might be your friend's only chance to get into the field. You might want to congratulate your friend for the job offer. It's a deal. Your friends buys a job. That's no free lunch, remember your friend has no relevant experience. Your friend is expected to pay to learn. It's just like buying a car, buying a house ... It's a business deal. Nothing suspicious here. Why the bankers receive so much money, and your friends can't (your friend has to pay!)? Want to blame? Blame for the incompetence. Your friend is not good enough, Simple. Read on. 

There's no conflict. You sign the upcoming contract. If you have a new offer from another company, you will sign it as well, and then terminate the first contract. If they don't let you do this, you make troubles on your first day for your first job, they will have no choice but to terminate you on the day. You might also get one week termination payment for your probation. Check your contract. Either you terminate your first job or you make them terminate you. Now, you can start your second job. 

The most common strategy for career switching is to go back to university, gain a degree say in finance, and then start fresh as a graduate programmer. Full-time master degrees should take you just about a year to complete. 

Then why should you give a notice to the company? It will never work well, and you gain absolutely nothing by speaking about your intention. 

When I interview candidates, I always ask for Github projects. Why? That's because I'd have better insight of what the candidate can do without asking them for a stressful stupid coding test. If your job requires bash script, that doesn't mean you must have an open source project for bash. You just need to build a portfolio of open-source projects you have done. Build something you love, do it good. Try to start a community for your project. 

Since you'll be making substantial edits to numerous parts of the manual, I'd make sure at least one other party reviews your review. It's easy to make your own mistakes in the middle of correcting his. For any technical corrections, I'd ask other, qualified co-workers to review them to make sure you did it correctly. Even if you're the expert, it's best to have multiple eyes on the subject so your end users aren't following the wrong directions. 

I'm not seeing a problem here that would require you to apologize to your co-worker. Your co-worker left on a 30-minute errand, then had an emergency come up. It happens. But then your co-worker apparently didn't bother calling work to inform you there was an emergency and kept you in the dark for several hours, during which time you were apparently at a total work stoppage. You didn't put him on the spot; he put himself on the spot. If he called work, but your bosses failed to inform your team, it's on them. But it certainly isn't your fault. Nor were you acting "impatiently" by asking what the hold-up was several hours after he was expected to be back. If anything, I'm wondering why you waited so long. Where I work, if you're 20 minutes late, we're calling you (that's about enough time to miss your bus, catch the next one, and be at work). Some places I've worked you'd get a call within 5 minutes. Is a question with lots of question marks rather informal and a bit on the juvenile side? Sure. Is it unprofessional? A little, but not really. Could you have asked via private message? Sure. Should you have? Maybe. Is it really a big deal? No. The bigger problem here is that you had a work stoppage and apparently didn't escalate it to your supervisors, who may have been able to help you work around the issue. Your next step should be asking your supervisors how they would prefer you handle situations like this in the future. Personally, if a co-worker is late, I go to my supervisor and ask, "Hey, did you hear from John Doe? His shift started 20 minutes ago, but I haven't seen him." This lets my supervisor know there's a problem, that they may need to assign personnel to help me, and that they should find out from John Doe what the hold up is and if/when he's going to be in today. It also gives them the chance to inform me, "Oh yeah, he's running late. He'll be here in about 30 minutes," so I can react properly or ask for help if needed. There no reason you can't tell your co-worker, "The other day, you didn't show up for hours, and didn't let anyone know what was going on. You should have handled the situation better, but I could have handled the situation a bit better too, so, sorry about that." But the fault really seems to be your co-worker's. So I wouldn't worry about it too much. 

For any non-trivial corrections, I'd write a paragraph or two on why you think your correction is better. For large projects, you can include this directly as a comment on something like Microsoft Word's "track changes" feature so future reviewers don't have to find you to ask about all of them. For small projects, you might just print them separately, with each blurb having a page number or something to identify it, then you can just reference it while you explain it over the phone or in person. If it's a long manual, I'd make sure to get a proper digital copy. Then you can make the edits directly and send back a ready-to-print copy. If it's just a short manual, you can make the edits directly to a printed copy and let him manually input the edits himself. That said, if his writing is as bad as you say, it might be better not to trust him; in this case, get a digital copy regardless of length. Besides, he'll appreciate you taking the workload off of him even if he's capable. If you're editing the digital copy directly, I'd make two versions: one version with all the pretty colors so he can easily review the changes (instead of making him play spot-the-difference on the entire manual), then a second version with the normal font colors so if he likes it, he can just publish it directly. The exception is if you're using software to track, reject, and accept changes; generally, such software allows you to just directly print everything without the markup. For digital edits, don't use obnoxious font colors. This isn't specific to fixing errors, but it's a common, annoying mistake people make. You can make a high-visibility color while still being pleasant to look at. Bad colors are anything with full saturation like bright red, yellow, or magenta. Instead, use somewhat desaturated, greyer colors. Additionally, bright colors on white paper or a white monitor have poor contrast. Yellow, cyan, and magenta are the worst pure colors since they're combinations of two primary colors each, but red, green, and blue are still annoying. Instead, use colors that are a bit darker so they contrast better with white, while still being bright enough to contrast with standard black text. 

I wouldn't bother with flattery. It's disrespectful. You don't have to say "like, OMG, your grammar is soooo awful!", but I wouldn't deliberately understate the problem either. Just say "All the grammar and spelling errors are marked with green unless I wasn't sure what you meant. In those cases, I marked them red along with any technical errors that need additional review." As my sample statement mentions, I would mark simple errors notably differently than complex errors.
