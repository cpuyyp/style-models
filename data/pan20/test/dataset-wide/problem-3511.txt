One example of monetary policy is the Bank of Japan buying the Nikkei as part of its asset purchasing program. Typically, a substantial share of citizens' wealth is connected to returns of their national stock market. Hence, it is generally not a wise move for a fiscal authority to invest public funds (not tied to pension schemes) in broad baskets of stocks. You might try looking into sovereign wealth funds, these are typically gargantuan profit-maximizing investment vehicles wealthy nations use to acquire risky securities. 

Suppose we're talking about some bundle of consumables, $x$. If preferences are monotone, either weakly or strongly, the general idea is that more is better. With local non-satiation the idea is that, no matter what $x$ you have, there is always some small change in $x$ that would make you better off. Is your question, does there exist rational preferences where: 

This is a paper using a competitive monopolistic framework (in GE). It is an old paper by Stratz (1989). Recent work with Stone-Geary preferences relates to the issue of structural transformation following the work of Herrendorf, Rogerson and Valentinyi (2013), although there is considerable debate on whether these preferences appropriately capture the data. All these papers have a representative consumer, with expenditure shares changing over time due to growth. 

I don't think there is right or wrong. Here is an example of what could be behind some of these arguments. Let us assume that there are two buyers in the economy: Singer and Foreman. Foreman enjoys meat but he prefers humane meat (other things equal). Let $V$ be the value that Foreman derives from a unit of humane meat and $v$ the value from normal meat. Singer is a consequentialist and has as a goal to reduce the meat consumption. Singer is willing to pay $1\$$ to reduce the total consumption of meat in unit and $\beta\$<1$$ to reduce the total consumption of humane meat. If Singer was alone, he would simply refrain from eating. Because Singer is a consequentialist he does not care who eats the meat (this simplifies the analysis). Now, suppose that there are scale economies in the production of humane meat so that the first unit costs $C$ and the second costs $C'$, while the production of normal meat has constant returns and the marginal cost is $c$. Both markets are competitive. If $V-C<v-c$, then in isolation Foreman would buy normal meat. Singer would have a disutility of $1$. If Singer buys humane meat then Foreman would do so too if $V-C'>v-c$ (which may be possible since $C'<C$). Singer would then have a disutility of $2\beta+C'$ (the price of the meat plus the total disutility of two units). If $2\beta+C'<1$, then Singer judges the world to be better if he buys humane meat and he proceeds to do so. Thus, if activists consider 'humane meat' to be much better than normal meat and there are substantial scale economies in its production, they may prefer to buy it as a way of inducing others to do the same. If they have agent-specific morality (e.g. they prefer a world in which others buy meat than a world in which they buy meat but they have the same world consumption), then participating in the humane meat market may be a less desirable option. Finally, notice that there are other ways in which Singer could improve the world. For instance, he can buy stock in humane meat consumption and swallow the losses that come from selling at a price $p=c+V-v<C$. This gives Singer a disutility of $\beta+(C-c)-(V-v)$ which is lower if $\beta$ is sufficiently high. (For simplicity I assume that Singer does not consider Foreman's consumption of utility as deserving moral praise so he does not include Foreman's extra utility in his computation. If he did, then buying humane meat would be even more desirable.) 

Consider the following example with a Cobb-Douglas production function having total factor productivity $A_t$, labor $L_t$, capital $K_t$, and effort $e_t$: $$ Y_t = A_t K_t^{\alpha} (e_tL_t)^{(1-\alpha)}$$ The intensive margin regards the level of effort $e_t$ (think intensity), and the extensive margin the quantity of labor supplied $L_t$. In a less abstract sense, think about output and hours worked. You can work for 2 hours at a normal pace and create one widget. Or, if you try very hard, you could make one widget in one hour. How do you get the same output from the same worker with different values of $L$? The intensive margin is the answer. 

Your question touches on seigniorage, which is the revenues a government receives from printing money. The issue is that, while the government may benefit (in the short run) from the additional revenues, the holders of money are penalized because their money becomes less valuable. While a low level of seigniorage is typically acceptable, if it becomes clear a government is going to finance the majority of its expenditures this way, then the government risks hyperinflation and a loss of confidence in the currency. Further, selling bonds can be beneficial for a few reasons. One, when a country participates in international capital markets, the act of paying off debt creates positive relationships with lenders and can lower borrowing costs. Two, it allows a government to smooth its expenditures over time. When the economy returns to healthy growth and is able to generate a surplus, the government will again be able to pay off debt it accumulated during leaner times. 

I am not a CS guy so this answe may be flawed in many ways. Take it more as a long comment and please give some feedback. Economists view Ethereum as a pure Arrow-Debreu market economy. In an AD economy you can write fully contingent contracts specifying commodity trades conditional on any future event at any particular date. Therefore, an AD economy is, by definition Turing complete. In that sense, for economists Ethereum is a cool implementation of an ideal but nothing new. The problem is that, as Arrow himself recognized (but not Debreu!), this model of the economy is not realistic in any way because there are frictions to contracting, undescribable events, unawareness, asymmetric information, uninsurable risks, etc. At a more fundamental level, economics has another problem that seems to me to relate to the halting problem. if an economic system was decidable, then the agents in the economic model would have to either know the answer or not know the answer. In the former case, there would often be an eternal loop, since the answer to the problem would be part of the problem itself (this is the essence of the Lucas critique). If you assume they do not know the answer then you are imposing a certain rule on their actions that will not be universal and therefore would not allow for Turing completeness on the whole economy. 

Dynamic Programming & Optimal Control by Bertsekas Introduction to Modern Economic Growth by Acemoglu The Acemoglu book, even though it specializes in growth theory, does a very good job presenting continuous time dynamic programming. 

Imagine a consumption set on the surface of an infinite dimensional unit sphere, where the dimensions are indexed by the counting numbers and represent different varieties of goods. The consumer prefers goods found in higher dimensions. So the 1 unit of good on the second dimension is preferred to the 1 unit of good on the first dimension. Thus, the consumer is never satiated because they would always prefer one unit of a good found in a higher dimension, and there are infinitely many dimensions. But these preferences do not satisfy monotonicity, because you must always give up a little bit of at least one good to acquire more of another. Hence, these preferences are rational, because you can rank all pairs on the surface of the sphere, and transitivity holds trivially. 

The easiest way to prove it is using the 'old' definition of continuity. $\succ$ is continuous iff whenever $x\succ y$, there exists neighborhoods of $x$ and $y$, $B_x, B_y$, such that all $z\in B(x)$ and $z'\in B(y)$, $z\succ z'$. Suppose $x\succ y$. Because $u$ represents $\succ$, $u(x)>u(y)$. Let $2\epsilon=u(x)-u(y)$. Because $u$ is continuous, there exists some $\delta>0$ such that for all $z\in B_{\delta}(x)$, $u(z)>u(x)-\epsilon$. Similarly, for all $z'\in B_{\delta}(y)$, $u(z')>u(y)+\epsilon$. But then for all $z\in B_{\delta}(x)$ and $z'\in B_{\delta}(y)$, $z\succ z'$ as required. 

Indifference is different from incompleteness. A good example is indecisiveness. Eliaz and Ok have a nice discussion. Suppose you want to buy holidays for your family. You know your wife prefers Bahamas to Florida to Paris. Since you do not care particularly about the destination, you choose trying to represent their preferences. If Bahamas and Florida are available, you will choose Bahamas. If Bahamas and Paris are available, you may choose either of the two. But if Paris and Florida are available, you may also choose either of the two (absent any intensity of preferences)!. Notice that you are not indifferent since if you strictly prefer Bahamas to Florida and you do not prefer Bahamas to Paris, you should strictly prefer Paris to Florida. 

In short, not really. Prof. John Cochrane offers an astute example of Granger causality by stating that a weatherman Granger-causes the weather. We know that a weatherman has no measurable role in causing the weather, but there is indeed an intertemporal correlation between what the weatherman says today and what happens tomorrow. 

It is generally not possible to make a sharp statement about the types of non-convex costs that Dynare can handle. Many different factors come into play about whether a model can be "solved" by Dynare or not. Is the steady-state correctly defined? Is the model stationary? Is the model differentiable everywhere in the ergodic set? Are the number of endogenous and exogenous variables equal to the number of equations? Is the model Blanchard-Kahn stable? But, to answer your question, can Dynare solve a model with a state-contingent fixed cost? Yes. This is not difficult, you should try to create one yourself. Try modifying a simple RBC model with capital and bonds. The trouble is not inducing the cost, but rather finding the steady state, which can be quite onerous if not done cleverly. Dynare, however, cannot solve Iacoviello and Pavan 2013 because of the min function found in a borrowing constraint. This min function induces a point in the ergodic set which is not differentiable. Dynare numerically approximates optimal policy functions about a steady state using perturbation methods. This requires employing the implicit function theorem to build out Taylor expansions of the optimal policies, hence you must be able to take derivatives everywhere within the ergodic set. 

The monopolist solves, $\max \pi=R(Q)-C(Q)=P(Q)Q-C(Q)$ The general solution is (if the problem is globally concave) $MR(Q^*)=P'(Q^*)Q^*+P(Q^*)=C'(Q^*)$. Since $P'(Q)<0$, notice that $MR(Q)<P(Q)$ and, therefore, $Q^*<Q^{C}$. In this example, we have $P(Q)=3-\frac{Q}{16000}$ and $C(Q)=Q$. Hence, $MR(Q)=-\frac{1}{160000}Q+(3-\frac{Q}{16000})=1=MC(Q)$. Rewritting, we get $3-\frac{Q}{8000}=1$ or $Q=16000$. To compute the price simply substitute in the demand function and get $P(16000)=3-1=2>1$. 

I do not understand your attempt very well. Assuming that the monopolist cannot directly price discriminate (i.e. charge different prices to old and new consumers in the same period), then in the second period it is optimal to offer a price of 50 and sell to everyone, regardless of whether the old guy bought or not. Knowing this, the old guy would buy in the first period iff the price gives him a total surplus of 50 (which he can get by waiting). Hence, the initial price should be 150. If, on the other hand, the old guy has a value of only 20, then in the second period the monopoly price would still be 50. Hence, the old guy has no surplus from waiting and the monopolist should charge 40 to him in the first period. 

The division comes from the entities guiding these sets of policies. The austerity program falls under fiscal policy, which is controlled by Parliament. Quantitative easing falls under monetary policy, which is controlled by the Bank of England. The policies enacted by these two entities are not necessarily coordinated, and can sometimes work opposite each other's objective. 

The first equation can be written as: $$ r_E(Levered) = \frac{E+D}{E}r_E(Unlevered) - \frac{D}{E}r_D $$ Then, isolating the unlevered return gives: $$ r_E(Unlevered) = \frac{E}{E+D}r_E(Levered) + \frac{D}{E+D}r_D$$ And this is the WACC. 

Check out the following: Jordi Gali; Monetary Policy, Inflation, and the Business Cycle: An Introduction to the New Keynesian Framework David Romer; Advanced Macroeconomics Michael Woodford; Interest and Prices: Foundations of a Theory of Monetary Policy The first two will ground you in the theory of nominal rigidities and the business cycle. Woodford's book is a good advanced text on the theory of monetary policy. I would not start with Woodford to understand the basic New Keynesian model. Practice problems with the first two books first, then move on to Woodford. 

Prescription drug prices, like those of most other retail products, fail to satisfy the law of one price routinely. The most obvious observation is that prices differ across pharmacies at a given point in time ($URL$ but just like supermarkets give discounts, so do pharmacies. If you always buy from the same shop, you are bound to end up paying different amounts. The reasons for this are manifold. Different consumers have different abilities or willingness to store and buy large chunks when it is cheap and stochastic prices allows for price discrimination (see Sobel 84 for an early reference). The idea is simple. Myopic consumers arrive in each period and buy if $p<V$, then leave the market. Otherwise, they die. Strategic consumers have a valuation of $v<V$ but can wait if the price is above $v$. Firms compete in prices. In equilibrium, firms charge often $p=V$ to extract rents from myopic consumers but every now and then they offer $p<v$ to attract all strategic consumers looking for prices. Competition between stores may also result in random prices in a standard consumer search framework. Finally, retail prices may change because manufacturers prices are also random as a way to discipline pharmacies by encouraging consumers to shop.
