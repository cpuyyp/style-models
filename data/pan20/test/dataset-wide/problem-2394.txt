As far as i know , there is no mention of god ( the word God in local parlance) in buddhist texts ,the term used is Devas (beings in the higher realm). In ancient hindu texts there is mention of devas and asuras .Devas representing good and asuras evil .The term asura is thought to be a corruption of the word Ahura of the ancient iranian Ahura mazda (possibly be a tribal conflict between hindus and zorastrian followers during ancient times). Since the versions of buddhism practiced today are not the exact replicas of what was buddhism during buddha's times. could this element be a corruption of the original meaning through influence of hinduism...? I have read somewhere about the heavy persecution of buddhists (to bring buddhists back to the hindu fold) by brahmins and hindu kings after the death of king Asoka. Rebirth,reincarnation etc becomes more believable as metaphorical terms. So could the term may have had the meaning like good individuals or similiar in the past.? 

Attachment to something can cause of dukka ,so if you feel something is not good for you ,better avoid it, avoid the extremes ,practice moderation. Meditation is not recommended for people with certain conditions, I read it somewhere long ago (not on the Internet) . Meditation relaxes your mind and body ,if somebody is having nervous or emotional problems,after meditation their nerves may get further dilated(Not good). Since you have asked for advice ,I suggest you regularly exercise(skipping rope ,running, walking and possibly some mild weight lifting at the gym also). Take care to balance your breath and try to bring a rhythm, It can also have the same effect of meditation,bringing mind and body together by controlling the breath. also some info here $URL$ 

In a relative sense, it is obvious that the father is the cause of the child's immediate suffering. That is plain to see. If the father was not abusing the child, then at least this one suffering would not exist. On a deeper level, however, all suffering is caused by karma. That is one of the four noble truths. For the father, his karma has ripened in a negative way such that it bears the fruit of abuse. His karma also has likely placed him in an environment to lead to such a situation. The father's suffering in this situation is thus caused by his own karma. For the child, his/her karma has ripened in such a way that he/she is in a relationship that has fostered abuse against him/her even if it is not the child's direct immediate responsibility. It is the law of cause and effect - the child's suffering was the result of ripened karma. The child was born into a specific circumstance and so on, and so forth. This does not mean that the child bears guilt for the situation at all. We, especially Westerners, develop attachment to the victim in a situation and produce a dualistic mindset of perpetrator vs. victim. On a relative level this is important - the father should be punished under the law. However, according to Buddhism, we develop equanimity for all. We feel equal compassion for both the child and father as we see with deeper wisdom that the karmic fruits of both parties led (and will lead) to their suffering. But each person bears their own karma - each person bears their own suffering as a result of their karma and the ignorance in their mind. To contrast, I recently read an account of two Tibetan nuns who were imprisoned, tortured, and raped for many years by their Chinese oppressors after the 1959 occupation of Tibet by China. Instead of choosing suffering, however, these women viewed what was happening as the result of karma and thus were able to find peace in the situation in that the karma was being resolved - it would not linger any longer after the events were over. Horrific and horrible as a situation may be, a mind directed towards enlightenment can view any situation and opt to avoid suffering and thus end the negative karma. We can also choose not to act on negative karma (i.e. in the case of the father in the abuse) and avoid it as well. It is not fatalism to hold such a view of karma - each decision is indeed our own responsibility moment to moment. That said, if we are not brought out of ignorance, we may never see it as such and thus cycles of abuse can persist across generations of families. Perhaps the father was abused when a child - you can see how things get complicated quickly. Of course, it would be wrong to simply say, "Well, too bad, that was the karma." That is fatalistic and incorrect and lacking compassion and love. However, once one has received wisdom and had some level of realization, you can see how any one being's suffering, be it human, animal, or otherwise, is the result of their own karma and the subsequent results from karmic causes. It is the cause and effect that has persisted indefinitely backward in time and stopping one's own negative karma is indeed a big part of enlightenment. 

"The Pali term Karma literally means action or doing. Any kind of intentional action whether mental, verbal, or physical, is regarded as Karma" You have to look at the action (good or bad) and the consequence( Kamma & vipaka). whether one has a sound mind or unsound mind doesn't matter, without intention there is no action. Even a person suffering from psychosis uses his mind to do things, so without thoughts nothing good or bad happens( the thoughts may be abnormal,incomplete,unclear or confusing) ,but a person with psychosis may not feel the consequences like a normal person ,so the magnitude of suffering may differ for the same actions committed by different people. 

Don't follow blindly ,you have to think and find what is better for common good and do it. As per kalama sutta " don’t go by reports, by legends, by traditions, by scripture, by logical conjecture, by inference, by analogies, by agreement through pondering views, by probability, or by the thought, ‘This contemplative is our teacher.’ When you know for yourselves that, ‘These qualities are skillful; these qualities are blameless; these qualities are praised by the wise; these qualities, when adopted & carried out, lead to welfare & to happiness’ then you should enter & remain in them.” 

It doesn't square well against the notion of Right Action (or Right Conduct) on the Noble Eightfold Path. 

(Also, in your two sample lists, you could also mention that an action could go with or against the Noble Eightfold Path.) 

It's normal to have doubts, especially about your own feelings. And it's especially normal to feel doubts when you're feeling unexpected (and good!) things such as you are. You might think to yourself that it "seems too good to be true". But focus deeply on the feelings: really consider them, and allow yourself to try to see their source. With the right insight, you can truly understand these feelings and determine whether they are true. 

sabhāva by itself means "own-being" or "own-becoming". It describes the intrinsic nature or essence of living beings. 

If going to work while ill could cause others to become ill, that would be bringing harm to others. So it's probably not a good idea. 

If you are ignorant of the cycle of day and night, or the phases of the moon, or even of gravity, your ignorance does not prevent them from happening. Universal laws are just that -- universal -- and they don't change for those who don't know of, understand, or follow them. There is an element of intention behind all karma/action, and this intention factors into the quality of the actions. A wrong action done with pure intention is certainly less bad than a wrong action done with evil intention, but it's still a wrong action. The "brain disorder" example is interesting, but again, ignorance of universal laws does not halt or change the manifestation of the laws. One can never escape the effects of one's actions, regardless of the circumstances. Even Angulimala could not escape the accumulation of karma from his time of killing: 

The base (most subtle in Buddhist terms) awareness we experience seems to be the exact same awareness that animals and even insects experience. I am not talking about intellect or cognitive abilities but the simplest base sense of "experiencing the world around us". Personally, meditation on this concept has helped. "Hells", "Heavens", and the like could simply be states of mind. In some ways, we are born, live, and die moment to moment as each moment causes the next, and a bad mindstate in any given moment could indeed be considered "hellish". Modern neuroscience has not been able to pin down if human experience is indeed purely physical or if it is perceived by the brain. I have corresponded with numerous neuroscientists on Quora and have found a consensus that this is still the elephant in the room. Sure, we can see how the brain uses nerves to send a signal to my fingers to tap the keys on my keyboard. But the actual experience that decides to initiate the tapping? That is still elusive. Modern quantum physics involves reality coming into being when there is an observer. Perhaps our experience is the observer when a quantum wave collapses? If so, it is independent of the physical universe it observes. (On yet another side note, the overlap between Buddhism theory of mind and quantum physics is a fascinating study) 

In the general view of "attachment" in Buddhism, is the quality of attachment considered to be the same across all possible types of attachments? Or are there different qualities or degrees of attachment? Put another way, can one kind of attachment be considered "less bad" or "more bad" than another kind? Or is it all just "attachment" in a general sense, without distinction? For example: Is clinging to the nostalgia of an old childhood friendship any different than clinging to money or cars? 

I would propose three steps. I think there is great power in having a simple awareness of the present moment. Recognizing the significance of the present—that it is truly the only time that matters, the only time in which we can really do anything— is the first step. Wikipedia: Mindfulness The second step begins with a simple realization: the past is over. But the very next part of this step is even more important: the realization that dwelling in the past is a form of clinging, and that this clinging to the past only causes more suffering. Wikipedia: Dukkha The third and final step is to become familiar with mettā meditation and to get really good at the first stage (loving-kindness for oneself). Benevolence toward oneself can go a long way to chip away at regret. Wikipedia: Mettā So, to summarize: 

Although I was not present, it sounds like the monks were not referring to "punishment" in the sense of being "punished for sins" by some divine arbitrator. Instead, the fruits of karma (cause and effect) ripen and cause what we name a "rebirth" in a higher, lower, or equal realm. In the Buddhist tradition, anything that is not a human rebirth is perceived as not desirable as the human experience is the one most able to approach enlightenment. Since the fruits of karma come about from one's own actions, it would be self-inflicted "punishment" - perhaps not the best choice of words but not wholly inaccurate. Is it punishment if you fall to your death after jumping off a cliff? We might say it is gravity "punishing" an individual in such a situation - such is the verbiage here. In Buddhism, it is up to you to experience your own karma. Nobody judges you for it or can change it for you, but karma will allow you suffer the consequences of your decisions. Interestingly enough, the Buddha contradicted himself on a number occasions depending on the crowd he was speaking to. This was due to the skillful use of words to explain something to his listeners in a way that they could understand. Have you thought that perhaps the monks in this case were employing skillfulness in a similar manner to describe these things in such a way that it would cause you to wrestle with these concepts? As an aside, it sounds like the real problem may be with the question of rebirth and a desire to object to any language centered around it. If indeed rebirth existed, then would you still have an issue? There are a number of highly realized individuals throughout history that have claimed either experience or insight into other planes of experience. That said, I have wrestled with the concept of rebirth in the past and can't say that I have solved it but I would put forth a few thoughts:
