Of course it's okay to ask. Working in an office, I see at least 3 emails a week from somebody who has emailed our sales address asking if there are any jobs available. Even worse than this, we sometimes get a website enquiry asking the same thing. Speaking personally, it puts me off. If someone cannot be bothered to phone up and ask for the name / email address of the person in charge of hiring, then it immediately gives the impression that they are a lazy person. Probably a broad generalisation but that's how it feels. Pick up the phone, explain that you have applied for a job and would like to know the name of the person in charge of hiring. Simple as that. If you can get an email address (you may have pre-interview questions after all) then all the better. 

The company I work for has three locations. My contract says that my place of work is location A but this may change due to the needs of the business or, if I was to take this literally, I could be in for a 240 mile daily round trip to work if they decide to relocate me. It’s unlikely to happen but it’s in my contract and I signed it, same as you did. So what can you do? Find another job would be the quickest answer but you would have to ask yourself why you’re so keen to leave so quickly. If it’s just this one task you‘ve been asked to do then get over it, and quickly because every job you’re going to have throughout your life has tasks you won’t want to do and you’ll find yourself changing jobs every few months. If it’s the company culture or something else then that’s different but first you need to identify why you’re so keen to ditch this company so quickly. You could try talking to your supervisor, explaining that you’re doing the manual testing but it’s not what you’ve been hired for and as soon as an appropriate task comes up, you’d like to do it. It almost certainly won’t make a bit of difference. Your supervisor wants to get this task done and he’s chosen you for it but if you really feel you need to, then talk. 

There's no harm in making contact with them now, even to ask a generic question. If I was out of state, it would be something to do with food arrangements. Since you're not local, you don't know if you need to take something in with you or if there are places you can purchase food. Equally, it could be asking who you need to report to on your first day if you don't already know. Make it polite and say that you're really looking forward to getting started and leave it in their hands. 

Your contract will state what your working hours are although, if it's anything like mine (and the 6 or 7 before that) it will say something along the lines of "may be changed as per the needs of the business" which is a standard get out clause for this kind of thing. Should your employer expect you to suddenly work full time when you're on a part time contract? No. There's usually a reason (child care, elderly relative, secretly an international spy) why you've taken a part time job and it is unfair of them to do so. So, what can you do about it? If they're paying you for the extra hours, you could just say thank you very much and pocket the extra cash. Equally, you could say that your contracted hours are such and such and only work those hours. I've been in a similar situation with someone leaving the company unexpectedly so I told them what extra hours I could work around my other responsibilities and that is all I could do. They appreciated that I did extra while a more permanent solution was found and everything returned to normal when staffing levels did. 

Google gives you the option to log out of all your devices at once by accessing your account from a desktop pc. Instructions on how to do this here: $URL$ As for the Microsoft issue, I'm not sure I fully understand. You should have gotten a log in to access the work domain and have a separate username and password than your personal one. If this is not the case and you're using your personal account to access a works computer then there's not a lot you can do. If you're just using the laptop to access OneDrive / Hotmail etc. then changing your password will deny them access to your personal information. In future, make sure you log out / delete any files you don't want your former employer to see before handing back the laptop. 

Along with jferr's answer: If you have shares then you should understand that every single dollar taken out of the company is money that is no longer available to be used for something else. In a startup, every single dollar needs to be able to directly return at least it's value, and usually far more, rather quickly. The question you need to ask yourself, as an owner, is "Should that $100 go into my pocket or should it be used to help generate a sale or otherwise attract investors?" For example, do you need brochures? If so, $100 buys a decent amount of those. Do you need a website with email? Whoever is in charge of the purse strings needs to ask themselves "Is this absolutely necessary?" and "What value will this add to the company?" If it's either not absolutely necessary and/or it isn't adding value then it shouldn't be spent. 

Yes. The employee, presumably you, should sit down with the boss and calmly come up with a plan for how best to go forward. Keeping everything in until you blow your lid isn't professional. Ultimately, no one can help you until you let them know there's a problem. 

Wow. That sounds like a lot of drama for a company with only 6 people. In such a small company there are a LOT of considerations with moving people around. Number one of which is cost. The network plug thing might not just be whether there is an actual plug in the wall but also if the router etc has space. Those cost real money to replace. But there's more to it. I have a small office in which I (as CEO) was considering moving a couple employees around in order to facilitate communication. However one of the guys I was going to move smokes and the person I was going to put him with told me he'd quit if I moved a smoker in with him. I don't want to lose people right now so that plan was scuttled. The benefits of retaining both people outweighed (by far) the benefits of making it easier for a couple employees to talk about business. It might very well be that the CEO initially thought they could move you but a personality conflict with another employee has stopped this and the CEO has no idea how to resolve it right now. It might simply be whether they have the money to make whatever changes they need to in order to make it happen. It might also be that someone is going to be fired (or quit) soon so they don't want to do anything until it's all shaken out and certainly don't want to alert anyone else. However, there seems like there's yet another more serious issue here. You say 

Management is considering selling the product to a third party and that group is starting to perform their own analysis of it. If this is a core product that solves an industry wide problem then it means the company is just looking for an additional revenue stream. Management is considering selling the company or seeking investors. Again, if it's a core product then the company valuation might be based in part on how good a job you're team has done. Management has lost faith in your team and their own ability to continue development. Unfortunately, the only way you'll know for sure this happened is the day they fire your team. Although you can get a clue depending on what prompted the previous manager to change positions. If it was a sideways move and wasn't at the manager's request then this becomes more likely. 

The above sounds to me like you've been talking salary etc with people at the client company. This is generally considered a huge no no. The primary reason of which is that at least one of the people involved in the conversation (usually all of them) will come away from it unhappy no matter what everyone is being paid. Never mind the fact that a lot of people won't exactly be truthful with what they are making anyway. As you are starting out, one thing you need to learn is that your salary has nothing at all to do with what others are paid. Even if you have the exact same qualifications and exact same tasks to perform. The only time this isn't necessarily true is if you are unionized, but that's a completely different set of issues. Your pay, benefits, etc is between you and the company that actually signs the check. Generally speaking the time to negotiate salary is prior to accepting an offer or at your review. Being unhappy about salary when you are only a month in implies that you've simply changed your mind. Regarding overtime, the amount of unpaid overtime you get is a function of how well you stand up for yourself. If you just "yes sir, I'll work all night sir." then it will not get any better. Honestly I'd call my parent company and tell them that overtime ends unless I'm properly paid for it. It's up to them to work out the issues here. Of course, I"m at a radically different point in my life where I can make such demands and find another job in a day if it doesn't work out. So you might have that conversation in a less confrontational way... ;) Again, not with your on site supervisor rather have it with the company writing your check.
