It has been written that the British invasion of Washington, and the burning of the Capitol, White House, and other public buildings, was in retaliation for American raids in Canada which caused the destruction and looting of public and private buildings there. A point favoring this view is that the British left the city while it was still burning and did not attempt to hold it. My question is whether the British, in its wars with other countries, prior to or contemporary to the War of 1812, had ever burned down government building in the capital cities of its enemies as a means to break their enemy's will to fight? 

My father-in-law was a master sergeant of a Quartermaster Corps Depot Company during the Battle of the Bulge. I would like to find out where his depot was located (and I'm assuming it moved from time to time), and to find out which armies, divisions and battalions it was assigned to equip. How can I find that information? 

As I understand it, Confederate militia companies were formed of 100 men recruited at the beginning of the war often from within the same county. Disease, battle losses and desertions obviously took their toll. One of my great grandfather's served in the 12th Georgia and his company was decimated at Spotsylvania Courthouse; he and three of his brothers were taken prisoner. Was it possible then to bring up new conscripts and recruits to fill out the thinner companies? If so, where were they trained and how were they integrated to the existing units? If not, what happened to the troops in below-strength companies? Were they merged with other units? On the brigade level, if say Baker Company was cannibalized to bring Able Company up to strength, could the brigade commander call on his state to create and train a replacement company? 

The symptoms of PTSD were first described by Herodotus when referring to Epizelus, a survivor of the 490BC Battle of Marathon, in his Histories 6.117.1-3: 

According to Henry Pfanz's book, The Second Day, there is a historical dispute as to how far General Ambrose Wright took his brigade of Georgians up Cemetery Ridge during the second day of the Battle of Gettysburg. According to Wright's after-action report, Pfanz writes, his units reached the crest of Cemetery Ridge and he was able to accurately describe union troops on the Baltimore Pike -- something that he would not have been able to see from below the crest. This would put the high-water mark of Wright's brigade as far up as the widow Leister's house before Stannard's Vermont troops counter-attacked and caused heavy losses on Wright's left flank unit, the Georgia 48th, and well-beyond the high-water mark of Pickett's charge on Day 3. Pfanz further elaborates that Wright's account is bolstered by his personal report to Lee where he said it had been relatively easy to charge up that hill, perhaps causing Lee to commit Picket's units to reattempt the assault the next day. I find these facts persuasive, but I note that other historians dispute Wright's claim nevertheless and believe Pickett went further. What facts do critics muster to counter Wright's claim? How did Pickett's high-water mark come to be the definitive furtherest line of advance on so many maps and descriptions? 

I'm going to take a stab at this because I also have Parkinson's Disease. Parkinsonism is an umbrella term that describes many conditions which share some of the symptoms of Parkinson's. The main symptoms of Parkinson's – tremor, rigidity and slowness of movement – are also the main symptoms of a number of conditions that are grouped together under the term parkinsonism. Generally, Parkinson's symptoms are caused by a lack of dopamine in the brain. See more. Yesterday (September 30, 2014), I attended a fascinating lecture by Dr. Abraham Lieberman, M.D., a neurologist who specializes in Parkinson's and has written and lectured extensively on his analysis of Hitler's handwriting, films of his speeches, still photographs, and reports of his behavior. I am rewriting this answer to include his analysis. The most common form of Parkinson's is Idiopathic Parkinson's disease. Its typical symptoms are tremor, rigidity and slowness of movement, among others, but symptoms and the rate the condition progresses can vary in each patient. The underlying cause of idiopathic Parkinson's is unknown and a diagnosis is usually determined after testing the patient with anti-Parkinson's medicines, such as carbidopa/levodopa. Ibid. This medicine was not developoed until the 1960s and would not have been available to Hitler. Parkinson's can also include a slow gait (which is how I was first diagnosed five years ago), stooped posture, a voice reduced to a whisper, and a dull stare that does not seem to focus on its surroundings. Those suffering from Parkinson's can also suffer from cognitive disorders that include a lack of imagination and spontaneity, difficulty making decisions and general apathy. Lieberman believes that all evidence points to Hitler having Parkinson's, although some of his behavior may be explained by other factors. However, Lieberman believes that after being gassed in World War I, Hitler contracted encephalitis which was being transmitted at about the same time as the Spanish Flu, and that Hitler had the post-encephalitic brand of Parkinson's, rather than the more common idiopathetic type. One clue for this is that in Mein Kampf, Hitler tells that he had a "relapse" of symptoms he suffered during his gassing. This is extremely unlikely, Lieberman says, and was more likely a cover story to describe his hospitalization for von Economo's encephalitis -- something a rising politician would not want to admit. Hitler's asocial behavior; his obsessions and compulsions, his cruelty and rages can be explained by a diagnosis of von Economo's encephalitis. A. Lieberman, "Hitler Had Post-encephalitic Parkinsonism," Pubmed.com, National Institute of Health, Apr. 1996. Lieberman says that Hitler may have shown transient Parkinson's symptoms as early 1923 when he was 34, possibly in his handwriting which is beginning to become smaller. Film of his speaking during the 1920s, however, show that he enthusiastically waved both arms during speeches. In contrast, by the mid 1930s, Hitler speaks with his left hand at his side or in a pocket. Where the left hand is shown in film, tremors can be seen. Looking at Hitler's handwriting from the 1920s, 1930s, 1943 and 1945, Lieberman demonstrated that there was a clear trend to micrography -- i.e. the signature becomes smaller and smaller. Photographs in 1945 show Hitler stooped over, his face lacks expression, and according to Albert Speer and others, Hitler dragged his left foot and spoke more softly.See this article. A common symptom of Parkinson's is that patients show a lack of impulse control, often turning to gambling and other high-risk endeavors. Lieberman notes that even before he showed Parkinsonian symptoms, Hitler was a gambler -- his takeover of the German government, and his earlier attempt at a putsch, being prime examples. He said that while some scholars believe that Parkinson's affected Hitler's judgment, and his failure to take the advice of his generals, that is a difficult conclusion. Parkinson's may have enhanced his risk-taking nature, but one cannot conclude this based on available evidence. He writes of this in this paper. Lieberman also questioned the conclusion of Prof. Nassir Ghaemeni who believed that Hitler abused amphetamines and was bipolar. Lieberman said in the lecture and in his papers that Ghaemeni could not conclude that based only on hearsay and without actually meeting Hitler in person. 

Brig. Gen. Evans Fordyce Carlson is known in history as a three-time awardee of the Navy Cross, a Marine who had served in several wars as an enlisted man and officer, the co-founder of the Marine commando organizations in World War II, the man who populized the phrase "gung ho," and a close friend of Jimmy Roosevelt, son of President Franklin D. Roosevelt. See Wikipedia and this recent article in Naval History Magazine, Tesluk, Michael, "The Marines Commando Experiment" (Aug. 2014). The Naval History Magazine article compares then Maj. Carlson, who commanded the Marines 2nd Raider Battalion, to Lt. Col. Merrit Edson, who commanded the 1st Raider Battalion: Whereas Edson was "orthodox" and "conservative" and a "tried and true professional Marine officer, Carlson, in the words of an officer who served in both units, "Carlson was extremely liberal. . . . [He] picked up a lot of ideas in China that weren’t too popular with the establishment. He arranged daily meetings with his men to preach his version of Oriental philosophy, the gospel of “gung ho” [Chinese for “work together”]. Any enlisted man had the right to see Carlson without going through the chain of command. Rank had no privileges." Have any historians, writing about Carlson or the Raiders, discussed just how unpopular was Carlson with the establishment, or whether senior commanders may have suspected him of being a communist? Have any historians discussed why Edson received a Medal of Honor for his unit's heroics at Guadalcanal whereas Carlson's award for that battle was a step lower? Note, Carlson died in 1947 three years before McCarthyism took root.
