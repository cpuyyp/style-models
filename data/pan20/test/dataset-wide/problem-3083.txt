The logo on the helmet and lapel does look an awful lot like a rather blurry Somerset Light Infantry badge known at various times as the 13th Regiment of Foot, 1st Somersetshire, and Prince Albert's Regiment Of Light Infantry. You might be interested in The British Empire's history of the Regiment and could perhaps get your hands on The History of the Somerset Light Infantry (Prince Albert's) 1685-1914. The crossed rifles indicates he's a qualified marksman. The trefoils on his sleeves are, I believe, purely decorative. The medals are too blurry to make out. Two stripes on the left sleeve are Good Conduct stripes. Two indicates he's been in the service without being subject to formal discipline for at least 6 years and not more than 12. That they're on the left sleeve indicates this photo is after 1881. 

This might seem bad, but putting fuel and water tanks on the outer hull is a form of anti-torpedo defense. The liquid fuel will dissipate the shock and slow fragments. Taihō was able to quickly repair the worst of the damage. Putting fuel tanks in the path of a torpedo might seem like madness, but liquid fuel will only burn as a vapor mixed with oxygen. A full tank (or one filled with an inert gas) will not burn (sorry, Hollywood). But that vapor became a problem... 

According to the IANA nee Olson Time Zone Database, the only non-hour time zone in the US after the Standard Time Act of 1918 was Hawaii who used -10:30 from 1896 to 1947. 

Yes, so many that I'm only going to give one example of each or I'll be here all day. Reasons to not use a ranged weapon include: stealth, conserving ammunition, not wanting to be lethal, close quarter combat, and (in the era of muzzle loaders) to have a repeating weapon. Stealth Forgoing loud, ranged weapons, specifically firearms, in favor of melee has a history about as long as firearms. You avoid shooting in order to cross a killing ground, and to surprise (or avoid) the enemy. The musical Hamilton describes a scene from the Battle of Yorktown. 

Unfortunately instead of the five years recommended to make the change over, Atatürk ordered it done in three months which is barely time to make and distribute new materials let alone retrain a whole nation. To emphasize the point, "Law on the Adoption and Implementation of the Turkish Alphabet" (Türk Harflerİnİn Kabul Ve Tatbİkİ Hakkinda Kanun ) meant that all public communications would be done in the new language whether the public knew it or not. 

source The Germans wanted Lebensraum. The Soviets wanted a buffer zone against the inevitable German invasion. The Baltic states wanted to retain their independence. The Soviets didn't believe the Baltic states would be able to resist a German invasion, or thought they'd ally with the Germans. The Baltic states didn't believe their independence would survive a military pact with the Soviets. Unfortunately, that was all true. Shortly after the invasion of Poland, the Soviets accused the Baltics of not actually being neutral and demanded they sign "Mutual Assistance Treaties" (Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania) which theoretically protected the Baltic states, but just allowed the Soviets to establish military bases on Baltic soil which they would then use in June 1940 to take over those countries. They tried the same thing with Finland fearing the Finns would either ally with Germany or the Germans would simply bowl them over as they did other neutral countries. Not being boxed in, and assuming the Swedes and Western Allies would come to their aid, the Finns politely rejected the offer recognizing it would lead to the loss of their sovereignty. The Soviets, suspecting Finland had already allied with Germany, trumped up a bunch of charges and invaded in winter of 1939 starting the disastrous Russo-Finnish Winter War. The humiliating defeat for the Finns led to them becoming co-belligerents (not really allies, just fighting against the same enemy) with the Germans to recapture territory lost in the Winter War, exactly what the Soviets feared. This was known as the Continuation War. In the end, only Finland kept their sovereignty. 

I can think of two instances that fit your description well enough, both during WWI. Bulgaria and Italy. Both countries declared themselves neutral. Both countries were courted by both sides to join in. Both eventually did, though they did so with a declaration of war just before attacking. Italy Italy did it twice. First by denying to enter the war on the side of the Central Powers, and then by entering the war a year later on the side of the Allies. Despite being a member of the Triple Alliance with Germany and Austria-Hungary, Italy declared themselves neutral saying the alliance only applied to defensive wars. Both sides campaigned hard to get Italy to join and open another front against France or Austria-Hungary. Italy wanted chunks of Austrian territory that Austria was not willing to give, so the Allies offered it to them in victory in a secret agreement, the 1915 Treaty of London. Italy declared war on May 23, 1915 and attacked the next day. The Great War has a nice video on Italy in WWI. Bulgaria After fighting the First and Second Balkan Wars, Bulgaria had a bone to pick with its neighbors. Yet it declared itself neutral when war broke out as it was thought this would be a quick regional war. Like Italy, Bulgaria had a secret mutual defense treaty with the Ottoman Empire. And, like Italy, when the Ottomans entered the war Bulgaria refused to join. After Austria experienced a series of humiliating defeats against Serbia, the Central Powers became interested in bringing Bulgaria into the fight both for their army, but also to open a land route to supply the Ottomans. The Allies also tried to bring Bulgaria in the war to help defend the Serbians and attack the Ottomans. But only the Central Powers were willing and able to give the Bulgarians the territory they wanted, which was in Allied countries. The Bulgarians waited. On Sept 6th, 1915, Bulgaria and the Central Powers signed an alliance. A secret portion outlined all the portions of Bulgaria's neighbors Bulgaria would get were they attacked, plus guarantees for loans. Finally, a portion of the Bulgarian army was placed directly under German control of Generalfeldmarschall August von Mackensen. On Sept 22nd the Bulgarians mobilized, but covered it up by stating this was "armed neutrality" to defend its borders. On October 6th a German and Austrian army once again attacked Serbia from the north. Once it was clear this offensive was going well, a now well-prepared Bulgaria declared war on the 14th and invaded Serbia from the east. The Great War has a nice video on Bulgaria in WWI. 

The Anglo-Zanzibar War fits your criterion, in part because it was so short, but it was also conducted with civil restraint. The new Sultan was suspected of assassination and violated a British treaty by occupying the palace. The British attempted negotiations and finally issued an ultimatum to vacate the palace at 0900. Half an hour before a final attempt at negotiation was attempted and the British made it clear they would open fire. The palace grounds were fired upon. A single Zanzibar naval vessel was sunk when it fired at the British fleet. Surrender was accepted 38 minutes later. The British landed troops to help put out the fire and patrol the streets. The sultan fled to the German consulate who escorted him out of the country. About 500 people were killed in the bombardment and subsequent fire. It's difficult to know who was civilian and who was not; the palace was defended, in part, by a hastily raised militia. The British gave ample warning of their intent to fire for them to have been evacuated. 

All civilian casualties of the entire war which are estimated to be 5,000 to 50,000, depending on who you ask. So the idea that NATO bombing alone took tens of thousands of civilian lives is already a stretch. The UN's Human Rights Council reported 60 civilians killed and 55 wounded due to NATO bombing. Human Rights Watch's investigation found "NATO air strikes killed at least 72 civilians, one-third of them children under age 18." 

Once the battle was joined, the major advantage the US submarines had was poor Japanese damage control. Time and again, relatively minor damage to Japanese carriers is magnified by out of control fire and failing damage control systems. Albacore only hit Taihō with a single torpedo... 

One of the clearest outcomes of the Winter War was to increase production of the then brand new T-34 tank at the expense of light tank production. This allowed the Soviets to rapidly replace their early losses of obsolete light tanks in 1941 with the far superior T-34. Without the Winter War, they would have been replacing their light tank losses with more light tanks. Prior to the Winter War the Soviets put their faith in light tanks, such as the BT and T-26, or overly complicated tanks such as the T-28. Their light armor made them very vulnerable to even the small number of relatively light Finnish anti-tank weapons. Soviet tank crews were poorly trained and poorly organized. They had a tendency to charge ahead of their supporting infantry, break through the lines, and then sort of mill around waiting for orders which weren't to come because they often lacked radios. Without supporting infantry (often busy being mowed down by Finnish small arms fire) they were easy pickings for Finnish anti-tank teams armed with explosives, Molotov cocktails, and anti-tank rifles. The Soviets learned from this. They needed tanks with heavier armor. The tanks needed to coordinate with the infantry. They needed radios. And they needed more tactical flexibility. All the basic reforms the Germans had been training and practicing for years. These reforms were in progress when the Germans invaded. They gave the Soviets a year head start on the learning game. The T-34, without which, it can be argued, the Soviets could not have won WWII, saw its combat debut in the Winter War. The then brand new, relatively expensive, and controversial tank showed its stuff. With the poor performance of light Soviet armor this ended the debate over whether the Soviets should use many cheap, fast, light tanks, or fewer more expensive medium tanks. Production of the T-34 would be given priority in September 1940. 

Good military operation names are picked for these reasons: to deliberately deceive the enemy, to have no association with the operation whatsoever, to raise the morale of the troops, or for political/marketing reasons. The US is big on giving high level operations that will be announced to the public impressive names like "Desert Shield", "Desert Storm", "Desert Sabre" and "Just Cause". These are operations that are already intended to be discussed in public. The names are picked so the press isn't talking about "Operation Blue Spoon" (the original name for Just Cause). They usually contain many, many lower level operations with more secure names. Operation Vittles was the name for the US airlift of supplies to West Berlin during the blockade. Operation REFORGER is an acronym for "REturn of Forces to GERmany" and it's also symbolic of the intention to reforge the German army in the event of a Soviet attack. Operation Magic Carpet returned US troops to the US after WWII. Operation Eagle Claw would have had US special forces snatch US hostages out of Iran using helicopters (it was a disaster). And so on. The British military, more secretive and devious than most, called their operations in the Gulf War Operation Granby which is the name of a British commander in the Seven Years War and has nothing to do with Iraq. Again in 2003, what the US called Operation Iraqi Freedom the British called Operation Telic, and the Australians called Operation Falconer. During WWII Prime Minster Churchill would regularly tinker with operation names (and everything else) he thought might give something away. If you look at the list of Japanese operations, they give a lot away in their operations. Operation AL is an attack on Alaska and Aleutian Islands, Operation MO is on Port Moresby, Operation MI is on Midway, etc. These names were likely picked for expediency during early planning and never changed. The invasion of Normandy was originally Operation Slegehammer. The lesser known invasion of southern France was Operation Anvil to match. They were changed to Overlord and Dragoon to avoid any information leaking out. (D-Day was Operation Neptune). Going the deception route, the German invasion of Denmark and Norway, very much intended as a surprise, was called Unternehmen Weserübung or Operation Weser Exercise implying an exercise on the Weser river nowhere near Norway. As this was during the Phoney War or Sitzkreig period, the "exercise" part fed into the Allied perception that the Germans weren't going to attack. Later, Germany would do the same thing with Unternehmen Wacht am Rhein or Operation Watch on the Rhine implying a plan to defend the Rhine River which is exactly what the Allies expected; this was the code name for The Battle Of The Bulge. If you want to know more, this article from Parameters goes into some detail about military naming choices. You can also pick through this list of military operations and find plenty of examples, though keep in mind that list is likely to contain more high level and popular operations which are more likely to be political branding. 

The gun-type uranium design was more conservative, but imploding a plutonium core was more efficient. Future bombs would all have plutonium cores. Each bomb has a core of fissile material. If you're keeping track, that's two plutonium cores and one uranium core used in WWII. There were no more bombs completed during WWII, but the parts were including more plutonium cores. The most famous of these is the Demon Core. Since this was the third plutonium core produced, and its fate was uncertain until very recently, I believe this might be the nugget of the claim of a "missing third bomb". 

The way they casually talk about the gun suggests it's not a prototype, but an exported, easy to get commercial item. No, nobody had a gun then that could kill things with a two meter cone of green light, we would have heard of it. We still don't have practical handheld energy weapons. The "rigid" effect sounds like electrocution. You could get that effect with a lethal taser, but that requires firing darts with wires into the target with a maximum range of 10m. Tasers were invented in the 70s and the 100 pace range of the electric revolver is about 75m. 

The Soviets and Germans had no illusions that the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact would hold. Hitler was very clear about his contempt for the Slavs and plans to expand eastward. The Soviets were eager to delay the coming war with Germany as long as possible to give themselves more time to prepare, something made very acute after their humiliation in the Winter War with Finland. The Germans wanted to secure their Eastern flank while they were stomping around Western Europe and Scandinavia, as well as secure valuable resources that would be cut off in the inevitable Allied blockade. The Soviets were riding a knife edge with Germany. On the one hand, there were talks of the Soviet Union joining the Axis in late 1940, but these went nowhere. On the other hand, German and Soviet paranoia meant any move could be seen as hostile. A Soviet treaty with Japan could been seen as strengthening ties with the Axis, or it would be seen as securing their flank in preparation for war with Germany. Once Japan joined the Axis in late 1940 it became more clear that a treaty with Japan would be seen, publicly anyway, as a gesture of goodwill and peace towards the Axis. The Soviets ultimately decided to negotiate a treaty. Meanwhile Germany had already decided to invade.
