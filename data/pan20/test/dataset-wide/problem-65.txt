There are so many different political histories out there that it's tough to use any one of them as a canonical example. As an interesting one, take the entity that is now the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland: 

The problem is, the two continents have come together somewhere around my world's equator, and thus the fjords that formerly populated the northern continent in the northern polar region find themselves regularly enduring temperatures of 100 degrees Fahrenheit. Actually, the above explanation - a continental merger - is not what I want. I'd rather have the two continents form together, where they are now, rather than have continental drift send one down from the north. This is because the east-west mountain range is inconvenient for the purposes of a story I've set in this world. However, I couldn't come up with a better explanation for equatorial fjords, although I did consider having a version of the Snowball Earth, which should cover the tropics. Therefore, I turn to Worldbuilding Stack Exchange. Is it possible for fjords to form on the equator? If so, how? It's worth noting, as I just found out, that Slartibartfast designed Africa with fjords for the Earth, Mark II, but he's not around for consultations. 

Compressibility. Your idea of his body forming an indentation rests on the assumption that the Earth's core is incompressible. This is not true. While it is thought to be solid, this does not mean that it can't be compressed. I find it highly unlikely that any sizable indentation would be formed, especially given the size difference: The inner core is about 1,220,000 meters in radius. Your average boy probably doesn't top two meters in height. Temperature and pressure. Again, working from Wikipedia's numbers, I find that the temperature at the edge of the inner core is about 5,700 K, about as hot as the surface of the Sun. The boy will be burned to a crisp . . . unless he is crushed by 3,300,000- to 3,600,000-atm pressure all around him.

The dashed lines are important because they are hypothetical migrations - in other words, while there's evidence in the form of fossils for the others, there is not yet a lot of evidence for the dotted line migrations. If, say, homo neanderthalensis had gills, Neanderthals could have braved the trek from Scandinavia over the North Pole (not incredibly plausible, I'll admit) and to the Americas, thousands of years before homo sapiens got there via the Bering land bridge. That's quite important. 

Choose the properties of your star at a given time - essentially, luminosity. Choose the physical properties of the sort of planet you want, early in its life. These include atmospheric composition, mass and radius (maybe), albedo, etc. Create models of the evolution of the planet depending on the incident stellar flux. Determine the range of fluxes in which such worlds can be habitable. Calculate the radii at which the stellar flux will take these values. 

My completely-non-expert assessment is that it's a planet. But you can disregard that, if you want. Some experts are saying it's a brown dwarf, so you may want to just agree with them. However, some are on the fence: 

First, let’s look at the different types of trajectories a solar sail can take. They differ mainly based on something called the lightness number, $\beta$, which depends on the composition and structure of the sail. $\beta$ can be used to determine the type of trajectory the solar sail will follow: $$\begin{array}{|c|c|} \hline \text{Value of }\beta & \text{Type of trajectory} \\ \hline \beta=0 & \text{circular Keplerian} \\ \hline 0<\beta<\frac{1}{2} & \text{elliptical} \\ \hline \beta=\frac{1}{2} & \text{parabolic} \\ \hline \frac{1}{2}<\beta<1 & \text{hyperbolic} \\ \hline \beta=1 & \text{rectilinear} \\ \hline 1<\beta & \text{flipped hyperbolic} \\ \hline \end{array}$$ This is also evident in Figure 4.8 (page 123) of Colin McInnes’ Solar Sailing: Technology, Dynamics and Mission Applications, which is my primary reference in this answer: 

Part 1: Initial assumptions If we were to assume that the elevator cable is visible from any distance (assuming no obstacles), then this is actually a simple exercise in geometry. Here's a quick diagram I drew (note: elevator length not to scale): 

I think it would be the other way around. The high-tech side is much more likely to have developed ways of crossing the ocean (boats, aircraft, etc.) than the Renaissance-era side, and they likely developed them much earlier. So I'd bet that the high-tech side would invade first, before any of this happened. But you mentioned a global war, so I'll go back to what could happen on the high-tech continent. Things the high-tech folks wouldn't have to worry about: 

There are many good studies on oxygen toxicity. One NASA page reviews many studies on the limits. Tobias (1967) came up with the following graph of the limits of the percent of oxygen vs. the total pressure of the environment: 

How do you have to adjust the habitable zone? Well, the answer is that you don’t. The classical Nemesis hypothesis puts some unseen object at around 100,000 astronomical units from the Sun (and yes, for those curious, it’s generally regarded as being nonexistent). It’s generally thought to be a brown dwarf or red dwarf, either or which would account for its apparently extremely low luminosity. Your choice of a black hole makes the observations even more difficult, because the Hawking radiation put out by this black hole will be negligible. An accretion disk could light things up a bit (literally, though the generation of a magnetic field near the center of the disk), but that would still likely be nowhere near Earth, or any of the other plants, for that matter. 100,000 AU is far. For those wanting exact numbers, Wikipedia puts the power output from a 1 M$_\odot$ black hole at about 9$\times$10^-29 watts, roughly 55 orders of magnitude lower than the luminosity of the Sun, and at 100,000 times the distance. Actually, given that the power is inversely proportional to the mass of the black hole squared, this figure will be even lower. There will be virtually no contribution to the radiation received by the Earth. But because I’m a bit nerdier, I ran some quick simulations using My Solar System. I started with a body of 0.0006 units of mass orbiting another body of 200 units of mass at a distance of 38 units of distance with an orbital eccentricity of ~0 (I have no idea what their units are, for the record). This ratio is approximately that of the masses of the Earth and Sun; I chose these figures so the simulation would run reasonably well. The period of the planet is 1 unit of time, which I’m equating to 1 year. 

I recommend GPlates. Its originally purpose was constructing tectonic plates and showing how they move over time (it was developed by geoscience departments at several universities across the world), so I think that it's ideal for creating continents. It also has excellent documentation, good compatibility with a variety of operating systems (Windows, Linux, and MacOS X). Here's a quick gif I made showing what the environment looks like (on Windows, at least): 

You'd have pretty much no warning. There are two possible ways you could figure out when a star will collapse via a supernova: direct observation and theoretical modeling. Direct observation A supernova isn't just the "explosion" of a star. It's so much more than that, because it depends on a complicated chain of processes. In turn, each of these processes can differ depending on the star. Several different chains can lead to a core collapse supernova. 

Yes. I think the question of the most important factor, though, boils down to nature versus nurture: Will these individuals be smarter because of genetics, or because they're in an environment encouraging learning? Points in favor of intelligence through nature: 

I would think that's it. The water is going to absorb a lot of the energy of the asteroid. Also, it could break up upon re-entry, creating a lot of smaller rocks (yikes!). This would further dissipate the energy, although a much bigger are could be effected, and the resulting damage could be substantial. 

Note: This answer assumes that those going to Mars have a high IQ (which I believe the OP intended), and that IQ is indeed a fairly good measure of intelligence. 

Oh, yes. It violates this reasoning, as well as conservation laws aplenty, including energy, linear momentum, and angular momentum. Any energy associated with motion instantaneously disappears, with no possible mechanism for its loss. 

Yes! And even without the tidal heating. O'Brien et al. (2005) modeled impact craters on Titan using finite-difference methods for various impact scenarios, including a wide range of sizes and temperature profiles. Here are some of their findings: 

Build bunkers and protected areas out of it. In a comment, I cited an answer I wrote on Skeptics about Starlite and how it is, for all intents and purposes, a hoax. However, in that answer, I cited an article from The Telegraph that was pointed out by Bobson. According to the article, Starlite - well, some form of it, because little-to-no reputable information is available about any of the tests - survive a simulated nuclear explosion: 

All of this, for the best models, is extraordinarily complicated. I don't know how to do most of it. However, we can look at one type of case which is really simple: the idealized greenhouse model. A simple derivation can be found here. Let $T_s$ be the surface temperature and $T_a$ be the atmospheric temperature (assuming that both are roughly uniform across the planet). The planet itself has albedo $A$, and its atmosphere has an absorption constant $f$, which depends on its composition. The incident flux is $F_s$. The energy balance equation for the planet is $$\frac{F_s(1-A)}{4}=(1-f)\sigma T_s^4+f\sigma T_a^4\tag{Planet}$$ The equation for the atmosphere is $$f\sigma T_s^4=2f\sigma T_a^4\tag{Atmosphere}$$ Putting these two together yields $$\frac{F_s(1-A)}{4}=(1-f)\sigma T_s^4+\frac{f}{2}\sigma T_s^4=\left(1-\frac{f}{2}\right)\sigma T_s^4$$ Rearranging, we get $$T_s=\left[\frac{F_s(1-A)}{4\sigma\left(1-\frac{f}{2}\right)}\right]^{\frac{1}{4}}\quad\text{or}\quad F_s=\frac{4\sigma T_s^4\left(1-\frac{f}{2}\right)}{1-A}$$ The latter is probably more helpful to us if we want to find the boundaries of the habitable zone, although because it is so idealized, it still doesn't take into account more complicated effects like radiative forcing. I should also note that setting $f=0$ makes $T_s$ simple the planet's effective temperature. However, it is almost never true that $f=0$; on Earth, $f\simeq0.77$. I suspect I may have gone into a little more detail than you needed. As I said at the beginning, you really only need those two equations to figure out the rough boundaries of the habitable zone. Still, I hope that the rest of this answer was a little - dare I make this pun - illuminating. 

To find the average separation between two stars, we calculate the mean interparticle distance, scaled correctly (i.e. the Wigner–Seitz radius): $$r_s(R)=\left(\frac{3}{4\pi\mathcal{N}(R)}\right)^{1/3}\tag{3}$$ We add another section of code: 

According to Shoene et al. (2013), the uncertainty in the decay constant of uranium-238 is $\pm0.11\%$ - or about 5 million years, over the age of Earth. This has the most precisely determined $\lambda$. Now, you don't have to use slow-decaying isotopes in all of your system. All you have to do is a trick: Have a reference time $t^*$ at which $N_A(t^*)$ is known, where $A$ is an isotope with a long half-life. Then, pick an isotope $B$ with a shorter half-life that can be observed over shorter timescales - that is, you can observe a significant amount of decay over the course of a year in a relatively small sample. 

The major problem with building a space station like a city is that you can't really make it anything like Earth: 

The strain, $h$, of a gravitational wave is $$h\sim\frac{1}{R}\frac{GM}{c^2}\left(\frac{v}{c}\right)^2$$ to a relatively decent degree of accuracy. Here, $R$ is the distance to the source, $M$ is the combined mass of the black holes, and $v$ is the orbital speed of the binary. If we gratuitously assume that $v\sim0.1c$ and $M\sim50M_{\odot}$, then $$h(R)\sim7.41\times10^7\frac{1}{R}$$ At one astronomical unit (AU) away, the same distance Earth is from the Sun, we find that $h\sim5\times10^{-4}$. In order to detect the waves, the species' "eyes" would need to detect a change in a meter-long object of half a millimeter - and that's with them living dangerously close to the black hole binary! Maybe extremely small lifeforms - bacteria, perhaps - would notice such a change, but macroscopic, human-sized lifeforms would not. Now, this $h$ is greater than the strain measured by LIGO, which was on the order of $10^{-21}$, so in general, it should be easier to measure. However, it seems highly improbable that the species would involve mini laser interferometers as eyes. It's true that the orbital speed of the black holes would increase as they begin to coalesce. Abbott et al. (2016) - the discovery paper announcing LIGO's observations that was published earlier this year - showed a maximum speed of about $0.45c$ (see Fig. 2): 

This method has the advantage that the person will do what it needs to do most at the moment. The downside is accidental procrastination. You could put off washing laundry for our equivalent of a month if other things are deemed "most important". But eventually the deadline would come closer, and soon laundry would become the most important task. This is the Principle of Selfish Convenience, and most of the time, it will turn out well. The one thing the Principle fails at is interactions with other people. If Person A and Person B keep doing things in a selfish order, and they each have to meet each other, then they may end up never meeting each other, if a window of opportunity passes. This will create a problem. Therefore, some aspect of synchronicity must be present in a society. 

Other notes It seems that all of the answerers to date agree that the object in question should be small. There are a few good reasons for this: 

How does this relate to you question? I went off on quite a tangent there, and I did it to try to show how important waterways and open land are to civilizations. I emphasized them because the rest of my answer depends upon those two factors, and those two factors alone. Calculating population Here's the bit you have to wake up for. I'll start out by counting rural farmers and ranchers. In medieval Europe, many peasants worked as serfs, working on a lord's land. In fact, a large portion of the population lived in rural communities: 

After writing this question about the ecology of a terraformed planet, I realized that I hadn't quite tied up all the loose ends of the terraforming process itself. I intended for a group of aliens scientists to turn a desolate hunk of rock into a somewhat Earth-like planet, but this isn't so simple. In particular, I faced a problem with water, among other things. Let's say that the scientists have already introduced an atmosphere (sans water vapor) that may help keep temperatures at the right level, good enough for liquid water to exist. One of their next steps will be to add oceans (roughly half the size of Earth's), to establish a water cycle and get things ready for plants to be added. The scientists don't know if there's any water belowground, though measurements have established that there may be some. Crust analyses show the potential for hydrogen and oxygen, but these haven't been definitive. The poles and other regions have been fully explored, but no liquid ice has been found. Taking all of that into account, what's the quickest (not necessarily cheapest) way to add the oceans? Other bodies of water will come later. 

McInnes goes through several substitutions, leading to $$r^3\left(\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta}{\mathrm{d}t}\right)^2=\mu\left[1-\beta\cos^2\alpha(\cos\alpha-\tan\gamma\sin\alpha)\right]\cos^2\gamma\tag{4.41}$$ From this and earlier substitutions, we can derive expressions for the radial velocity $v_r(r)$ and angular velocity $v_{\theta}(r)$. The equation for the former is $$v(r)=\sqrt{\frac{\mu}{r}}\left[1-\beta\cos^2\alpha(\cos\alpha-\sin\alpha\tan\gamma)\right]^{1/2}\tag{4.44}$$ There’s a fairly complicated relationship between $\gamma$ and $\alpha$, but it can be simplified for small $\gamma$: $$\frac{\beta\cos^2\alpha\sin\alpha}{1-\beta\cos^3\alpha}=\frac{\sin\gamma\cos\gamma}{2-\sin^2\gamma}\approx\frac{1}{2}\tan\gamma\tag{4.45,4.48}$$ This integration is important when we try to find a relationship between $r$ and $t$. We integrate $(\text{4.44})$: $$\int_{r_0}^r\sqrt{r}\mathrm{d}r=\int_{t_0}^t\left(2\beta\mu\sin\alpha\cos^2\alpha\tan\gamma\right)^{1/2}\mathrm{d}t\tag{4.46}$$ Integrating this and substituting in $(\text{4.48})$ yields $$t-t_0=\frac{1}{3}\left(r^{3/2}-r_0^{3/2}\right)\left(\frac{1-\beta\cos^3\alpha}{\beta^2\mu\cos^4\alpha\sin^2\alpha}\right)^{1/2}\tag{4.49}$$ However, we can simplify this by letting $t_0=0$ and focusing on cases where $r_0\ll r$ for most $r$, which is the case here when $r=r_f$. We can then find when the function of $\alpha$ in $(\text{4.49})$ is maximized; it turns out that for small $\beta$ (i.e. $\beta<0.5$), $\alpha_{\text{max}}\approx35.26^{\circ}$. However, I chose $\beta=0.75$, and so it turns out that $\alpha$ is maximized at about $35.26^{\circ}$. Plugging this back into our approximation for $\tan\gamma$, we find that $\tan\gamma\approx1.362$, which gives us $\gamma\approx53.7^{\circ}$. This likely makes our small angle approximation for $\tan\gamma$ less accurate, but it will do for now. Plugging this in, and assuming once again that $t_0=0$ and $r_0\ll r$, $(\text{4.49})$ gives us $$t=r^{3/2}\times1.23\times10^{-10}$$ and for a final radius of three light-years ($2.838\times10^{16}$ meters), we find that $t\approx5.88\times10^{14}$ seconds, or about 19 million years. That might seem like it can’t be correct, but Centauri Dreams cites Matloff et al. that it could take a really good solar sail 30 years just to reach the Oort Cloud, 500 AU away - and one light-year is about 60,000 AU. Clearly, a simple logarithmic spiral quite like this won’t work. In fact, this means that you absolutely need to give the solar sail a very fast initial boost to make interstellar travel on these scales even remotely feasible. This makes the equations a little harder, and it means that yyou might not see an easy analytical solution pop up. Let’s go back to our original coupled equations $(\text{4.37a})$ and $\text{4.37b})$, where we’ve set $\beta=2$ and $\alpha=0$. This becomes a simple central force problem, which has one equation of the form $$\frac{\mathrm{d}^2r}{\mathrm{d}t^2}-\frac{h^2}{r^3}=\frac{F(r)}{m}$$ where I’ve defined $h\equiv r^2\dot{\theta}$, which is conserved. $F(r)$ is the central force as a function of $r$; normally, in orbital mechanics, it’s simply $$F(r)=-\frac{GMm}{r^2}$$ as is the case in $(\text{346})$; here, as I noted before, we also have to account for the force from radiation pressure. With $\beta=2$, it just so happens that the two forces add up to $$F(r)=\frac{-GMm}{r^2}+\frac{(2)GMm}{r^2}=\frac{GMm}{r^2}$$ which is repulsive, unlike $(\text{346})$. That pdf shows a good derivation of the orbital equation from the central force law, which I’m not going to go through again, as it’s pretty standard. For a generic central force of the form $$F(r)=-\frac{k}{r^2}$$ we arrive at an orbit of the form $$r(\theta)=\frac{l}{1+\varepsilon\cos\theta}\tag{355}$$ where $k=-GM$ (in general, $k=(\beta-1)GM$), and $$l\equiv\frac{mh^2}{k},\quad\varepsilon\equiv\frac{l}{a}-1\tag{356}$$ I’m no expert when it comes to solar sail construction, so I read through McInnes et al. (2001) and came up with a conservative estimate of 2,000 kg. The authors estimated that you could send a 900 kg solar sail to solar orbit, with much of that mass being payload. My guess could be way off, so I’d appreciate it if an expert has better figures. I assumed that the solar sail starts out on a circular orbit around a sun-like star at roughly Earth’s semi-major axis. From this, I calculated $$v_0=\sqrt{\frac{\mu}{r}}=2.97\times10^4\text{ m/s}$$ $$h=\frac{|L|}{m}=\frac{rmv}{m}=rv=4.46\times10^{15}\text{ m}^2\text{/s}$$ $$k=(\beta-1)GM=1.327\times10^{20}\text{ m}^3\text{/s}^2$$ $$l\equiv\frac{mh^2}{k}=3\times10^{14}$$ $$\varepsilon\equiv\frac{l}{a}-1=2000$$ From this, I get $$r=\frac{3\times10^{14}}{1+2000\cos\theta}$$ $\varepsilon>1$ (as was expected, given that $\beta>1$), and in fact $\varepsilon\gg1$. I used modified code from this page to solve $(\text{4.37a})$ in Mathematica and plot the motion of the solar sail over the course of one year:
