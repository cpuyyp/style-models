The answer is yes. Let me explain why. Let $v \in E$ be any nonzero vector. Then define $E_0$ to be the closure of the set of vectors of the form $p(A_1,A_1^*, A_2, A_2^*)v$ where $p$ is a complex polynomial. By restricting $p$ to have rational coefficients you can see that $E_0$ is separable. Now the point is that $A_1E_0 \subseteq E_0$ and $A_1E_0^\perp \subseteq E_0^\perp$, and similarly for $A_1^*$, $A_2$, and $A_2^*$. I.e., $E_0$ is a "reducing" subspace. Now you can Zornicate and get a family of mutually orthogonal separable subspaces $E_\alpha$, each of which is reducing for $A_1$ and $A_2$, and which span all of $E$. Apply the spectral theorem separately on each $E_\alpha$. This shows you something even stronger than semifiniteness --- it shows you that $\mu$ is localizable: the measure space can be decomposed into a disjoint family of finite measure subsets, such that the measure of any set is the sum of the measures of its intersections with the members of this family. 

I'm puzzled as to why you would expect this ... no, let $(c_{ij})$ be the identity matrix ($c_{ii} = 1$, $c_{ij} = 0$ for $i \neq j$). That is positive semidefinite but it has infinite rank. There's a well-developed theory of positive semidefiniteness for operators on $l^2$. If the operator is bounded, then $\langle Av,v\rangle \geq 0$ for all $v \in l^2$ does imply that $A = B^*B$ for some bounded operator $B$. Edit: I just noticed that you asked for "rank $n \leq \omega$". If you weren't conjecturing finite rank, the question makes more sense. But if $n$ could equal $\omega$, then without boundedness assumptions expressions like $B^*B$ don't make sense. So I think the answer I wrote above that ignores the red herring of "rank" may be what you want. If you're really interested in unbounded operators we can talk about them too. 

Yes, you can conclude this. Let ${\rm Bor}(X)$ be the set of bounded Borel measurable scalar functions on $X$, equipped with sup norm. Then ${\rm Bor}(X)$ embeds isometrically as a subspace of $C_0(X)^{**}$. Now let $x$ be any non-isolated point of $X$ and find a net $(x_\lambda)$ in $X$ which converges to $x$, such that $x_\lambda \neq x$ for all $\lambda$. Now each $\delta_{x_\lambda}$ belongs to $M(X)$, so by the natural embedding of $M(X)$ in $M(X)^{**}$ it gives rise to an element $\tilde{x}_\lambda$ of $\tilde{X}$. Finally, since $\tilde{X}$ is compact we can find a cluster point $y$ of the net $(\tilde{x}_\lambda)$ in $\tilde{X}$. Then $\pi(y) = \pi(\tilde{x}) = x$, but $y \neq \tilde{x}$; we know this because the function $\chi_{\{x\}} \in {\rm Bor}(X)$ which is $1$ at $x$ and $0$ elsewhere, when realized as an element of $C_0(X)^{**} \cong C(\tilde{X})$, evaluates to $1$ at $\tilde{x}$ and to $0$ at $y$. 

Yes, this is a mistake in Vaughn Climenhaga's answer to that other question. Surely he is thinking of the fact that the every measurable subset of $[0,1]$ is approximated from without by an open subset. To see that (S1) fails for $[0,1]$, let $\Gamma = \{A_1, A_2, \ldots\}$ be any countable family of measurable subsets of $[0,1]$. For each $n$ such that $A_n$ is not the entire interval $[0,1]$, choose $x_n \in [0,1]\setminus A_n$. Then the set of these $x_n$ is countable, hence it has measure zero, but it is not contained in any $A_n$ except those, if any, which equal $[0,1]$. So it is not approximated from the outside in measure by sets in $\Gamma$. 

Yes, indeed every Lipschitz space is a dual space, a fact which has been rediscovered (in varying levels of generality) several times. The earliest proof is due to Arens and Eells. Holder spaces are special cases of Lipschitz spaces because a function is $\alpha$-Holder continuous for a metric $\rho$ if and only if it is Lipschitz for the metric $\rho^\alpha$. ${\rm Lip}_0(X)$ is the space of Lipschitz functions on $X$ vanishing at a base point. This is the most general class of Lipschitz spaces; other Lipschitz spaces are special cases of these. The predual of ${\rm Lip}_0(X)$ is simply characterized as the universal Banach space containing an isometric copy of $X$ such that the base point of $X$ corresponds to $0$. There's a lot of information about the predual in my book Lipschitz Algebras (and there will be even more in a soon forthcoming second edition). A recent result is that for a large class of metric spaces the predual of ${\rm Lip}_0(X)$ is unique. 

Convolution with a delta function is just a shift operator. Well, if you're working on $L^2([a,b]\times[a,b])$ then I suppose it's a shift, truncated to fit in $[a,b]\times[a,b]$. In any case it's not compact. It may help to view convolution with a function $g(x)$ as an integral operator with kernel function $K(x,u) = g(u-x)$. Any integral operator with $L^2$ kernel will be compact (standard fact; see Conway's Course in Functional Analysis, for example), so if $g$ is square integrable and the total measure of your space is finite then convolution with $g$ will be compact. 

Okay, here's a counterexample. Let $\Omega \subset {\bf R}^3$ be the ball of radius 2 about the origin and observe that $\Omega$ contains the unit cube $[0,1]^3$. Define $f(x,y,z) = x$ and $g(x,y,z) = y$ on the unit cube and extend them to smooth functions on $\Omega$ which agree on $\partial \Omega$. Now let $\tilde{f}$ be any smooth function on $\Omega$ which satisfies $g(x,y,z) \neq g(x',y',z') \Rightarrow \tilde{f}(x,y,z) \neq \tilde{f}(x',y',z')$. Then on the unit cube we have $y \neq y' \Rightarrow \tilde{f}(x,y,z) \neq \tilde{f}(x',y',z')$. This implies that $\tilde{f}$ must be constant, within the unit cube, on every plane of the form $y = c$. If $\tilde{f}$ were not constant on any such plane then for every $c'$ sufficiently close to $c$ there would be points on the $y = c$ and $y = c'$ planes at which $\tilde{f}$ took the same value, contradicting the condition given above. We can put a lower bound on $\|f - \tilde{f}\|_2$ by integrating over the unit cube and recalling that on each constant $y$ plane we have $\tilde{f}(x,c,z)$ constant and $f(x,c,z) = x$. An easy calculation shows that the smallest possible value of $\int_{[0,1]^3} |\tilde{f}(x,y,z) - f(x,y,z)|^2$ is $\frac{1}{12}$. So $\|\tilde{f} - f\|_2 \geq \frac{1}{2\sqrt{3}}$. 

I've written fairly extensively on predicativism and on the paradoxes of set theory and logic. My central claims are (1) it makes better sense, both mathematically and philosophically, to regard all uncountable collections as proper classes, and (2) intuitionistic logic can be used to definitively resolve the classical paradoxes. I've written one book, Truth & Assertibility, and I have a bunch of papers on the arXiv: Predicativity beyond $\Gamma_0$ Analysis in $J_2$ Mathematical conceptualism Axiomatizing mathematical conceptualism in third order arithmetic The concept of a set Is set theory indispensable? Constructive truth and circularity Intuitionism and the liar paradox Kinds of concepts The semantic conception of proof Truth and the liar paradox Reasoning about constructive concepts Paradoxes of rational agency and formal systems that verify their own soundness The liar paradox is a real problem 

Edit: I'm retaining my original answer below, but here is a simpler formula which builds on Goldstern's modification of my answer. Work in the complex plane. Let $$A = \{z \in \mathbb{C}: 1 \leq |z| \leq 2\mbox{ and }0 \leq {\rm arg}(z) \leq \pi\}.$$ This set is homeomorphic to the unit ball, so for topological questions like the existence of fixed points the change is inessential. Define $f: A \to \mathbb{C}$ by $f(z) = iz^2$. Then the image under $f$ of the part of $A$ with argument between $0$ and $\pi/4$ is $\{z: 1 \leq |z| \leq 4$ and $\pi/2 \leq {\rm arg}(z) \leq \pi\}$, and the image of the part of $A$ with argument between $3\pi/4$ and $\pi$ is $\{z: 1 \leq |z| \leq 4$ and $0 \leq {\rm arg}(z) \leq \pi/2\}$. The rest of $A$ maps into the lower half-plane. So the image of $A$ contains $A$, and it is obvious from looking at arguments that there are no fixed points. (The alternative formula $f(z) = iz^2/|z|$ would eliminate the radial stretching, if one prefers this.) Original answer below. 

seems to me to yield an informal description of full second-order arithmetic, $Z_2$. As to whether mathematics can be formalized in such a system, the answer is yes, virtually all mainstream mathematics can even be formalized in weak subsystems of $Z_2$. See the book Subsystems of Second Order Arithmetic by Stephen Simpson. 

Yes, because $(P_n)$ is an approximate unit for the ideal of compact operators. If $C$ is any compact operator then $$\|T(I - P_n)\| \leq \|(T-C)(I-P_n)\| + \|C(I-P_n)\| \leq \|T - C\| + \|C - CP_n\|,$$ and $\|C - CP_n\| \to 0$ as $n \to \infty$, so the norm in the Calkin algebra is achieved by taking the limit $\lim \|T(1 - P_n)\|$. 

For fixed $u \in U$, the map that takes $(z,k)$ to $\langle z,(Bk)u\rangle_Z$ is a bounded sesquilinear form on $Z\times K$. (Bounded because $|\langle z,(Bk)u\rangle| \leq \|z\|\|(Bk)u\| \leq \|B\|\|u\|\|z\|\|k\|$.) Therefore there exists a bounded linear operator $B^*u$ from $Z$ to $K$ satisfying $\langle (B^*u)z,k\rangle_K = \langle z,(Bk)u\rangle_Z$ for all $(z,k) \in Z\times K$. That's a standard consequence of the Riesz representation theorem. I can't really make sense of what is meant by "eigenfunction of $U$" in the second question. 

Looks false to me. Let $X$ be the product of countably many copies of $\{0,1\}$ with the standard Bernoulli measure (each point has measure $1/2$). Index these copies with ${\bf Z}$, and let $T$ be the shift operator. I claim that evaluating along any free ultrafilter won't be measure-preserving. To see this, let $A_0 \subset X$ be the set of sequences $x = (\ldots, x_{-1}, x_0, x_1, \ldots)$ with $x_0 = 0$ and let $A_1$ be its complement, the set of sequences $x$ with $x_0 = 1$. Both of these sets have measure $1/2$. However, it is easy to check that $T^p(A_0) = T^p(A_1) = T^p(X)$, using the fact that the limit of a sequence along a free ultrafilter doesn't change if you modify the sequence in finitely many coordinates. So there's no way $T^p$ can be measure preserving. (Also, it isn't a homeomorphism.) 

I assumed a counterexample to Question 1 would easily yield a counterexample to Question 2, but I don't see this. A counterexample to Question 2 is what I need. 

There is no such space with more than one point. Let $X$ be any metric space and suppose there exist $x,y,z \in X$ such that $$a = d(x,y) > {\rm max}(d(x,z), x(y,z)) = b.$$ That is, there is a triangle in which one side is longer than the other two. Define $\omega: [0,\infty) \to [0,\infty)$ by $$\omega(t) = \begin{cases} t&0 \leq t \leq b\cr m(t-b) + b&b \leq t \end{cases}$$ where $m = \frac{a-b}{2b}$, and let $d'$ be a new metric on $X$ defined by $d' = \omega\circ d$. Let $Y$ be the set $X$ equipped with this new metric. It is clear that the identity map is bi-Lipschitz. However, there are no points $x',y',z' \in Y$ satisfying $d'(x',y') = d(x,y)$, $d'(x',z') = d(x,z)$ and $d'(y',z') = d(y,z)$. For distances $\leq b$ do not change, so the three conditions force $d(x',z') = d(x,z)$ and $d(y',z') = d(y,z)$, and this implies $d(x',y') \leq d(x',z') + d(y',z') \leq 2b$, which means that $$d'(x',y') \leq \omega(2b) = \frac{a-b}{2} + b = \frac{a+b}{2} < a = d(x,y).$$ Thus, there is a space $Y$ which is bi-Lipschitz equivalent to $X$ but does not have a triangle congruent to $\overline{xyz}$.
