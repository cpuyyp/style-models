Press ups, as stated in the question you linked to, are always a good option. You can use progressions and regressions, depending on your strength level. Dumbbell floor presses are also a good alternative if you don't have a bench and you can probably do a dumbbell fly variation. If you've got a couple of sturdy chairs, you can do dips between those (they target the chest if you lean forward slightly). 

You could potentially try recording Rate of Perceived Exertion (RPE) and Rate of Perceived Technique (RPT). Both on a scale of 1 - 10. RPE has been fairly well explained elsewhere, but is essentially how hard you feel you worked (so, a classic 20 rep squat session where you take your 10RM in the squat and squat it 20 times is going to be higher than polishing your guns with some cable curls). RPT is something I've taken from the Gold Medal Bodies (GMB) training programs. The idea being that you can rate your technique on a scale of 1 to 10, based on how it feels (and possibly on video review); so if you're squatting and your knees are caving in, hips are shooting up and you're doing a bastardised good morning / squat combination, your technique rating is going to be a lot lower than if you keep your knees out, chest up and back tight the whole time. You could also look at using some sort of heart rate monitor (yes, I know it sounds weird to use one with weight training, but I've tried it and it does reveal a surprising amount, probably because a heavy set of squats of deadlifts will make your heart try and burst out of your chest). I use one that gives you a breakdown of heart rate over the session, and an "MEP" rating for the whole workout (basically, a value of how hard you've worked. By itself, a single MEP value is relatively meaningless, but if tracked over a period of time, it gives you a measure of how hard you worked during the training session). If you want metrics to compare, volume (so weight * (sets * reps) for total poundage moved) isn't a bad comparison to make, but that doesn't really get you the intensity. Another option would be to get a gadget to measure bar speed, the idea being if the bar is moving slower this week for a given weight than last week, then arguably, you're training less intensely. I would say that your best bet is a combination of techniques. In your training log (you are keeping a training log, right?), record the RPE and RPT and get a heart rate monitor as described above, then, over time, you'll be able to track how intensely your workouts are. 

I'm not entirely sure what you mean by straight back without pictures (do you mean generally, or when they're holding specific poses?), but I know in some gymnastic based programs, they recommend training a position called the Hollow Body position. 

I would try and avoid smith machine squats for the time being. They take away a lot of the supporting strength from traditional barbell squats, and lock you into a very linear movement (i.e. up and down). I'd also avoid the leg press as your main lower body movement, as it doesn't involve the spinal erectors as traditional squats do. Instead, you could consider: 

Looking at what's in there currently, you'd write in your sessions sets and reps or time for the given exercise, i.e. 3 / 12, 3 / 60s, 30s, etc. The issue with this way of recording things is that it doesn't really give you much room. One of the key things when trying to get in shape is to get yourself stronger (everything is easier when you're stronger), and one of the best ways to do this is to constantly increase the weight that you're lifting. What I'd suggest you do instead is buy a cheap notebook and record your workouts in that. The benefits of a notebook are you can record a lot more information about weight, sets, reps and times, but you can also record other things that may be worth noting... Didn't sleep the night before and really struggled with the workout? Write it down! Stretched your chest at the start of the session and found the lat pulldowns a lot easier? Write it down! Did some hip flexor work at the end of each session and found your squat for improved? Write it down! Tried to perform a 50kg snatch without any training and dropped the bar on your neck and shoulders, popping one of them out of joint? Write it down! (To paraphrase Dan John, surgery is God's way of telling us we did something wrong). This may seem like a lot of notes to take, but there's nothing quite as motivating as flicking back through your notebook at the end of a session and seeing that you just benched more than you ever have before. Success leaves clues (another Dan John-ism) and everyone is different. Record things, look back and figure out what works for you. 

Running While running your foot does not strike the ground with your heel. Instead contact first occurs more distally on your foot (around your forefoot). Also your knee is never fully extended. Resulting in a more relaxed calf and shorter, more efficient stance phase. Propulsion Energy 

Abs exercises don’t remove belly fat The idea that you can remove stubborn body fat from one particular body part could be the most prevalent myth in the fitness industry. Certainly abs belts and abs machines try to promote this idea of “spot reduction”, but doing abs exercise will not burn any more fat off your body. In fact, when someone asks me how to get a six pack, I tell them “don’t do any abs exercises!”. Getting a six-pack requires achieving a low level of body fat that has nothing to do with how many crunches, or abs exercises you do. Your time is much better spent preparing your meals, planning your meals, or focusing on core, compound exercises. Overall, traditional abs exercises like crunches are extremely overrated. 

Romanian deadlifts and good mornings are both hinge patterns, however there are some major differences. Such as the lever action in relation to where the load is placed. A true good morning is a posteriorly top loaded hip hinge. The difference being the loading vector and range of motion. 

Exercises to Strengthen Strengthening exercises, when done regularly can make so many daily activities a lot easier. And I don’t mean going to the gym and throwing iron around – There are some great exercises that you can do from home. 

Increased muscle mass on both sides (with slightly greater gains on the heavy load side) In a way it actually makes sense: As muscle tension increases so does recruitment (or the number of active motor units) 

By neutral they mean subtalar neutral. This is the position of the subtalar joint in which the foot is neither pronated nor supinated. When the hindfoot is neutral. Excessive or prolonged motion or lack of motion will cause various deformities and pathologies. Proper biomechanics allow human beings to walk, run, jump, and move freely without pain or dysfunction. A pair of shoes off the shelf cannot be "neutral" as the topography of everyones foot differs. In addition the density (hardness) of your shoe insert will vary based on your unique requirements. To attain this neutral position you must be assessed by a Podiatrist and have a custom orthotic (shoe insert) casted and created. 

Walking Walking mechanics of the lower leg, foot and ankle are inefficient. as most energy from momentum is lost. During heel strike your knee is locked and fully extended causing this energy to be absorbed rather than transferred. 

That doesn’t mean you can’t do any cardio while building muscle. It just means that you need to perform cardio that minimally impacts the resources necessary to build muscle - such as shorter, more intense forms of cardio. 

Write down a simple workout plan - something like M W F you'll walk/jog/run up and down your hills. Have a plan in mind (a set number of times you're gonna run it - if it's too hard take a break just make sure you finish what you plan). Keep it simple. Maybe M and F you run 20 times up and walk 20 times down - Wed do the opposite walk up, run down.

This is partial obstruction of the arteries. If the obstruction dislodges this can cause a heart attack or pulmonary embolism. Your symptoms sound similar to early stages but is very treatable. 

UPDATE #2 Are you sure it's the supraspinatus? If you can see a PT in your area, however this is a simple clinical test that used to test for supraspinatus lesions: $URL$ 

I can say with 100% certainty that you absolutely DON'T. So if your "chest day" involves a flat barbell and dumbbell press, an incline barbell and dumbbell press, a decline barbell and dumbbell press and dumbbell flys to hit the upper, lower, inner, outer, major, minor, bigger, smaller, taller, shorter and whatever other part of your chest you think needs to be hit - you can stop. The truth is, there are plenty of people who have built an great looking chest by doing nothing but flat pressing variations. Their upper and lower chest grew just fine. You'll again find plenty of people with a great looking chest who, because of shoulder injuries, have avoided most typical exercises (flat bench press, incline bench press) in favor of more shoulder friendly exercises like decline presses and floor presses. Again, no portion of their chest ended up lagging. It all grew just fine. There are plenty of people who have built a great looking chest despite doing all of their chest exercises at a slight incline because they just "feel" it better that way. They aren't all walking around with an amazing upper chest and a big empty space underneath it. There are even plenty of people with an great chest who built it by doing nothing but different types of push-ups. Or just dips. In the grand scheme of things, none of it really matters all that much. Everything gets hit, everything grows, the upper and lower chest still get built anyway.
