This article on Wikipedia says that "some deaths did occur" but without details or citation (so perhaps, in its present state, it's best ignored): 

Assuming that "monkeys" includes Chimpanzees, Jane Goodall's documentation shows they really like bananas. For example: $URL$ 

... however saying that "if we discover a problem then we'll fix it" isn't the same as saying "there is not and will not be a problem". 

Is there scientific evidence that torture works? Chapter 10 of Ibid states that there hasn't [yet] been [published] scientific investigation: 

I've no reason to believe that these allegations are false: so I hesitate to call the claim "false" or "sensationalist". However I have various reasons to believe that the claim is not widely/generally applicable as may be implied by the Italian magazine: This FAO document says, 

A different more recent document i.e. Sweden HDI values and rank changes in the 2013 Human Development Report shows that Sweden's HDI is currently rising (and has always been rising, never falling). This document also says, 

That seems to be to be a genuine quote (e.g. IMO the factual reasoning is plausible, and so is the literary style, as is the BOC contact information including a bilingual email address at the bottom of the quote), but I haven't found (using Google) a copy of it from a more official source. For what it's worth, $URL$ contains a copy of a document which includes near-identical wording (except "RBA instead of "BOC") that purports to be from the Reserve Bank of Australia. 

According to the Penn and Teller video he was credited with saving a billion lives when he was awarded his Nobel prize (but I haven't found confirmation of that). However there's a book of which: 

There's a Scientific American article, Cost of Medical Care for Transgender Service Members Would Be Minimal, Studies Show, which cites two studies: 

This page explains why Health Canada (i.e. the relevant department of the government of Canada) does or doesn't warn various categories of people against using using various quantities of soy isoflavone products: it includes this statement for vegetarians. Soy - One of the nine most common food allergens says that you can be allergic to soy: in which case I suppose it is harmful to you, and you'd better avoid it. 

Dr Kerzin (who reportedly made the claim) might have been misunderstood by the reporter and/or the editor of the article. It might be truer to say that he is dead and meditating (for some suitably vague definition of "him", given that the self is difficult to define and that Tibetan Buddhists believe in a continuing existence after death and rebirth). The following are the first three definitions of "tukdam" which I found using Google. Tukdam 

According to the researchers, it 'can' or might work; and that is why they're running a human trial: to determine whether it is even plausible that it does work. The University of East Anglia article on the subject says, 

IMO we should take it for granted that opium (and perhaps cocaine) has been found to be desirable by at least some of the people who have tried it, resulting in addiction or at least repeated use, and that it is fairly safe or well-tolerated (in that, at the least, users tend not to die of it, at least not immediately). I think that the main argument against (and the argument in favour of making them illegal) is the cost to society. Quoting from the Opium article in the Encyclopedia Brittanica of 1911: 

My opinion after doing this research is that there is no conclusive (strong, widely accepted) evidence of harm; and that that implies that the 'normal' or 'occasional' dosages mentioned in the OP are, typically, relatively harmless. It may be worth noting too that there's little or nothing that's absolutely harmless - if you want to worry about soy, it's also possible to worry about the various alternatives (e.g. milk, meat, etc.). 

Clinical pellagra has obvious symptoms. Hoffer et. al. had a theory that psychosis may be caused by "subclinical pellagra" but again Google doesn't find reputable-looking (i.e. academic or government) web sites using that search term. 

Google easily finds the White House release in question: Statement by the President on the Occasion of Eid al-Fitr (August 07, 2013): it includes the sentences which it was alleged to. I quote below the complete text of the statement: 

They might well have been (even "probably were") alive until impact with the ocean, but it's unknowable whether they were conscious. 

One anomaly that is not explained is there is an apparent discontinuity in the graph for Figure 3 on page 30: 

You can see from the above that there are many factors (other than the type of lightbulb) which affect gross domestic electricity consumption. 

Bomb disposal pros train in Ottawa - Published in the Ottawa Citizen (the Ottawa Citizen is Ottawa's ordinary daily newspaper) 

Stevenson spent a lifetime (well, from 1961, starting at about age 43) looking for stories which he couldn't prove to be false, and found some. It says that he provided "evidence, but not compelling evidence". 

The first google hit for 'health canada' and 'processed foods' is this one. My summary: One type of 'processed food' are the baked goods which are sold e.g. on supermarket shelves. These may be made with e.g. trans fats, which extend their shelf life (e.g. prevent them going stale within the first day of their being baked, like normal baked goods do if you live in France). An excess of trans fats is bad for you (for example: it promotes heart disease). The harm you incur from eating a single baked good isn't sufficient to justify outlawing it. Nevertheless, it's not the healthiest thing you could eat, and an excess of it is harmful. For this reason, people are counselled to "avoid processed foods". 

... so "1.5 million Christians in 2003" looks like it could be an over-estimate. This BBC article (also cited by the same Wikipedia article) says, 

Edit: Also your question title says "prevent" as if smoking less than 3 is the cause of non-addiction: but instead there may be a different, pre-existing cause. For example, maybe some people are inherently more resistant (and others less resistant) to addiction, for all sorts of reasons (mental, physical, social, etc.). The people who are able to smoke less than 3 per day are the very people who were resistant to addiction. Whereas the people who are prone to addiction might start, saying, "Oh I'll just smoke 3, I won't get hooked": and then they don't stop; and then they can't stop even when they want to. 

The only video in that Daily Mail article is of Mark McAllister. According to this article the producers called 911, he went to hospital and was diagnosed with epilepsy. That's corroborated by this page of his employer's web site: 

Okay, so now we have two names for it! However, but the original question hasn't been addressed. Is it scientific model with predictive power? – Oddthinking♦ 

There are details, with a list of more than 250 references/citations, at (hyperlink). It talks about the following clinical uses: 

When my doctor asked me to get a flu shot, the reason he gave me was that it was to "increase herd immunity". Even if it's not measurably "effective" (in terms of quality of life) for the individual, I expect that it is effective for the "herd". One reason to have the shot yourself, is to (try to) protect other vulnerable people, like infants and the elderly. Because answers require references, here is one: The vaccination coverage required to establish herd immunity against influenza viruses says, 

IMO their conclusion is that Bt is of net average benefit, but that there have been some problems in some areas, due to inexperience etc. "Bt" is (if I understand the article correctly) not a single type of seed: rather it's a genetic modification applied to many varieties of seeds. So part of the problem (and part of the solution) is choosing the right Bt seed for the diverse environments: 

Following George's research I found the reference in Volume 2 of the Registres de Grégoire Ix Example URL 

It was therefore important that the investigation be independent of the Council, which comissioned the report. The terms of its independence are stated in Appendix A (page 121) of the inquiry, as follows: 

Though they were started in the Ming Dynasty (above), excavation might have continued into the Qing: 

So for a more modern version you might want to try to find that, which is available here (or a larger version with more background information reviewed here and available here). I haven't seen Sellier's version, however this review of it implies that its message is approximately as you remember, i.e. not atheist in its intent: 

Wikipedia's Quantum mysticism article suggests that the answer is "no". Wikipedia is also critical of the author you quoted, Rupert Sheldrake, saying, 

The above says, "potentially life-shortening" and "likely to hasten". Some of the paragraphs after that imply that the expert witnesses disagreed about whether it will in fact shorten life, for example: 

Mary Renault's novel doesn't portray him as having said that, nor anything like it. The fact that she doesn't mention it is significant: I think that she includes every known/accepted fact/story about his life (and, for the sake of the novel, adds details where the details aren't known: so the fact that a detail is in the novel wouldn't be significant necessarily, but the fact that something isn't in the novel is significant). The novel does add that a) succession wasn't assured (e.g. no primogeniture, no automatic transmission of the throne to his child); b) burying the previous king was a ceremony performed by the next/newly-chosen king (which explains why his body was an object of political/military value).
