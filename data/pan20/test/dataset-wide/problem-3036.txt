Alexander apparently received that epithet from the Romans, who admired him. The oldest surviving reference of the title is found in the Mostellaria ("The Haunted House"), a play written by Titus Maccius Plautus (c. 254 – 184 BC). This roughly a century or so after Alexander's death in 323 BC. 

The New Culture Movement was an intellectual revolution in China during the early 20th century. In a large sense it marked the birth of Communism in China. Originally, the movement emerged as a reaction to Chinese diplomatic weakness by the traditional literati. The movement was championed by intellectuals who had grown disillusioned with the early republican government, beginning in 1915 with the Chinese capitulation to Japan's Twenty-One Demands. Leading proponents of the movement include Hu Shih, Chien Hsüantung, Chen Tuhsiu, and Lu Hsün. Of these characters, Chen was a Trotskyist who co-founded the Chinese Communist Party, while Lu Hsün was a leftist who was sympathetic to Communism. Many involved were educators in the great universities. Within a few years discontent at foreign imperialism reached new heights over the Shantung Problem at Versailles. This culminated in the May Fourth Movement of 1919, emerging as a product of student (and professorial) activism in the great universities. A number of its leading members went on to become high ranking members of the Chinese Communist party, including co-founder Teng Chung-hsia and future first premier of the People's Republic, Zhou Enlai. The nature of both movements were to reject Chinese traditionalism, and import new Western ideas. This includes Communism, which were taken up by several leading members as mentioned above. Due to their influence, the May Fourth Movement became an early conduit for Communism to be introduced to the masses. The Chinese Communist Party was founded shortly after in 1921. Anniversaries of the May Fourth Movement continues to be celebrated in Communist China. 

Originally, the Zhou dynasty was largely a network of city states exerting loose control over territory in between. Barbarian tribes dominated much of this space, and at times became serious existential threats to the Chinese states. Most of these, especially near the centre of Zhou civilisation, were gradually subdued, colonised, and assimilated. By the Warring States period, the external borders of Chinese civilisation had made dramatic advances. 

Nonetheless, it is true that Poland did survive the Black Death relatively unscathed. In addition to Poland's relatively sparse population, a key factor is that King Casimir the Great wisely quarantined the Polish borders. By holding the plague off at the borders, the disease's impact on Poland was softened. 

Unfortunately there doesn't seem to be any particularly good map to illustrate this. The best I've found is this map of the extent of Nationalist government influence before the Japanese invasion. The Nationalists controlled regions are in green [2-7] plus Kweichou [9]. Note that that central government did not have control over Kwangsi (Guangxi) [8]. 

More previous delegates were elected to later Congresses, but for obvious reasons I am not going to bother with them. By these results alone, we can confirm that the two memberships overlapped to a very high degree. 

If you examine the following map of Prince-Bishorprics of the Empire, it becomes apparent that this is basically the same territories the video shaded. 

One of the impetus behind the Angles migration is a deterioration of climate conditions during the late classical period. This led to severe floods of the Jutland Peninsula as well as the German North Seas coast - including the lands of the Saxons and the Frisii. Hence, the reason the Angles (and Saxons) headed for England was as simple as that there was a relative abundance of land in England. The Roman withdrawal had also left it undefended, unlike France and Belgium where the Franks had settled. 

Certainly not every fight were to the death - that was considered very luxurious. Most of the deaths in such games would have been provided by condemned convicts. One of the most comprehensive studies were conducted by George Ville. In a survey of first century duels, Ville calculated that 19 out of every 100 fights edned in deaths. This gives a comparatively low death rate of 9.5% per gladiator, per fight. By the third century however, the death rate had climbed to 25%. It seems missio had changed from being the norm, to a reward reserved for a good performance. 

The cache at Mawangdui is the earliest major silk manuscript find in Chinese archaeological history. 

There are no specific rules, it is completely up to the founders. Many dynasties ultimately took their names from one of the ancient states of China. In any case, usually the actual choice were made in one of six ways: 

Equally certainly, not all felt such "growing revulsion" at keeping them - at least, not for many years to come. Those trophy skulls which weren't otherwise lost ended in a wide range of circumstances. Some were kept as prized family heirlooms. Others were donated to academia for study or used as teaching aids. At least a few ended up in museums as exhibitions or became apparently traded as collectibles. Several skulls were retooled into decorations; at least one was known to have been fashioned into a Halloween prop with an light bulb. In one case, a large number of skulls were harvested by a navy doctor. In 1974 he donated them to UC Berkeley for osteological studies, where they eventually became a museum exhibit. For a long time after the war, these trophy skulls were treated like souvenirs and memorabilia, or simply forgotten in a basement. As the decades passed however, custodians of Japanese remains increasingly sought to repatriate them to Japan. Often this came about as veterans began passing away and their surviving family went through their inheritance. Many veterans, too, began seeing their wartime souvenirs differently than their younger selves. 

Realistically speaking a reasonably knowledgeable Japanese person would've been able to spot Japan on a world map, based on the islands' relative position to Korea and China. This is probably true since at least the 400s. They were, after all, able to engage in extensive trade and diplomacy with the mainland. Their grasp of geography couldn't be that far off if they could sail back and forth. This is of course quite different to actually knowing what the islands look like. In terms of recognising the actual shape of the Japanese isles, a vague recognition may date to about the 700s. The borders of Japanese provinces were largely set between the Taika Reforms beginning in 645, and the promulgation of the Taihō Code in 701. From court records, it is known that maps were drawn up for the freshly-minted provinces and collated at the capital. The earliest known map of Japan is the Gyōkizu , supposedly created by the Nara-era monk Gyōki (A.D. 668 - 749). In actuality, the earliest documented version of Gyōki's namesake map was created in 805. Moreover, the original is long lost. The oldest surviving copies were made only as late as the Edo period. For example, the following map is found in a 1656 reprinting of the medieval Compendium of Miscellanea , an encyclopedia created in the late 13th century. 

Of special interest are the August and December entries (Lu's pact with the barbarians, and the death of Lu's duchess), which specified the dates. As far as I know, these are the earliest events in Chinese history that have verifiable exact dates. Note that these records are made in the traditional Chinese calendar, but that can be of course be converted to Gregorian dates.
