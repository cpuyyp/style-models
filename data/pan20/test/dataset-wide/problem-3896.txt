Note 1. that this construction can be applied to any homogeneous lagrangian, and for non-homogeneous lagrangian, first we homogenize them and after we apply this construction. Bibliography Jean-Marie Souriau, "Structure des Systèmes Dynamiques", Dunod ed., Paris 1970 

So, thanks to these two constructions you can represent smoothly any closed 1-forms or 2-forms on second countable manifolds whatever the group of period is, and any closed 1-forms or 2-forms on diffeological space with a diffeologically discrete group of periods. You can find the proofs of that in the paper La trilogie du moment (published in 1995), for the manifold case, and also in the book Diffeology, §8.42, published this year, for the general diffeological case. Now, for higher degree, I must say that I have no satisfactory construction to propose. The fact is that if you look to represent a closed 3-form thanks to a structure bundle, it's a dead end because on $S^3$, every principal bundle with structure group a Lie-like group is trivial(${}^3$) (because $\pi_2(G)=0$). Personally, I'm not satisfied with what I read in the literature on the subject. (1) Book Diffeology, §6.83. (2) For a general diffeological space this is still a work in progress. (3) Not true for a general diffeological group. 

Another example is certain strong forms of Fubini's Theorem. If you have a real value function on the product of two closed intervals which is bounded, and which is measurable in either coordinate when you fix the other, are the two iterated integrals equal? (In the actual Fubini's theorem you care about joint measurability, not just measurability on either coordinate.) If you assume CH, it is easy to construct counterexamples. It turns it is also consistent to have models where it is true. I don't have a good reference on this, if you know of one please add it in to my answer. 

You're missing the distinction between truth and proof. Godel's Theorem says there are statements which are neither provable nor disprovable (from a given set of axioms). Those statements are still either true or false in a given universe. Godel just says your axioms aren't good enough to tell which one. 

Sounds more like a homework/wikipedia problem and not suitable for here but anyways: First one should maybe mention Stones Theorem which says there is a one-to-one correpsondence between strongly continuous unitary one-parameter group $\lbrace U(t)\rbrace_{t \in \mathbb R}$ and self-adjoint operators $A$ given by $U(t)=\exp(\mathrm i tA)$. This follows from the more general Borel function calculus from which also follows that for $A$ self-adjoint and $f$ a complex Borel functions with $|f|=1$ follows that $f(A)$ is a unitary. For a hermitian operator this statement is wrong, but in physics literature there is often not made a difference between hermitian and self-adjoint operators and the technichal problems comming with these, I refer to the books of Reed and Simon. 

I don't have any book in front of me at the moment, so I am a bit improvising here, but you'll find this in eg. Reed Simon 2, Streater Wightman, or Josts book. Let us call the map $$E:{\cal D}(\mathbb{R}^2)\to H=L^2(H_m,d\Omega_m)\qquad f \mapsto \hat{f}|_{H_m}.$$ I claim that already $E(\mathcal D(O))$ with $O$, let's say, compact with non-trivial interior is dense in the Hilbert space, where $\mathcal D(O)$ are the smooth functions with support in $O$. Let us take a vector $v\in H$ orthogonal to $\mathcal D(O)$, i.e. $(v,E(\mathcal D(O)))=0$. We have to show that $v=0$ for which it is actually enough to show that $(v,E(\mathcal S(\mathbb R))=0$, because the Schwartz functions are dense. Now let us define the map $$ T:\mathcal S(\mathbb R^2) \to H: f \mapsto T(f):=(v,E(f)) $$ which turns out to be continous, i.e. a tempered distribution. We have to show that $T=0$. The Fourier transform of this distribution has support on the forward light cone (even on the mass shell), so it turn out that $T$ is the boundary value of an analytic function $\tilde T$ on $\mathcal T=\mathbb R^2+ i V_+$ (this depends a bit on your convention) where $V_+$ is the forward light-cone. It means that $$T(f) = \lim_{\mathcal T \ni z\to 0} \int_{\mathbb R^2} \tilde T(x+z)f(x)\mathrm dx.$$ But because $T \restriction_{\mathcal D(O)}=0$ it follows that $\tilde T \restriction_O=0$. By the edge of the wedge theorem $\tilde T \equiv 0$ on whole $\mathcal D$ and therefore $T=0$, what we wanted to show. 

As a working mathematician, not as a logician what I am not, set theory is the set (!) of rules in order to use the symbol $\in$, meaning "belongs to". That tells me when and how I can use it. EDIT: Someone downvoted my (short) contribution. I would like to tell him that what I said is not as trivial as he may think. This is what my colleague Luck Darnière specialist of theories of models (in France) says himself: 

In the same vein, chating: My advisor used to say "An interesting theorem is a theorem true which looks false". Well, tastes and colors... ;-) 

The subspace $Y \times S^1 \subset Y \times {\bf C}$ is stable under the action of $S^1$, thus it defines a sub-bundle in $L$ which is equivalent to $Y$ by $y \mapsto [y,1]$. This map is surjective since every $[y,z]$ with $z\in S^1$ writes $[y/z,1]$, and obviously injective. This is what, in this approach, replaces your bundle $L^\times$. And you can forget about it for now. Next, consider an equivariant map $\Psi : Y \to {\bf C}$, that is, $\Psi(z_Y(y)) = z\Psi(y)$, that gives a map on the quotient $\psi :y \mapsto [y,\Psi(y)]$ satisfying $$ \psi(z_Y(y)) = [z_Y(y),\Psi(z_Y(y))]=[z_Y(y),z\Psi(y)]=[y,\Psi(y)] = \psi(y). $$ Thus, $\psi$ is invariant by the action of $S^1$, then there exists a function (smooth because the projections involved are submersions) $\varphi : X \to L$ such that $\varphi(x) = [y,\Psi(y)]$ for any $y$ such that $\pi(y)=x$. And by construction, $\varphi$ is a section of $L$. You can show now that conversely, any section $\varphi$ of $\pi : Y \to M$ gives you an equivariant map $\Psi$. Take the pullback by the projection $(y,Z) \mapsto [y,Z]$ of the image of the section $\varphi$. 

Suppose one wants to color the points in the plane so any two points at distance one apart are different colors. How many colors are needed? I heard this problem when I was a kid. Back then the most I knew was that 3 is impossible and 7 is possible (tile hexagons of diameter 1-ε). I haven't heard about this problem since then and I don't know how to search for it. Is more known? Is this problem well known in certain circles? 

A certain rectangle can be covered by 25 coins of diameter 2. Can it always be covered with 100 coins of diameter 1? 

Unlike full choice, you probably use countable choice all over the place without even recognizing it. Every time you do something iteratively and then take some sort of limit to your construction, you're using countable choice. In many cases, if you do very careful bookkeeping, you can eliminate it on a case by case basis. But you have to be very careful. Without countable choice, the countable union of countable sets isn't necessarily countable. 

module categories are in one-to-one correspondence with braided autoequivalences of $\mathrm{Fib}\to\mathrm{Fib}$ for which there exist only the trivial one. 

An euclidean theory which fulfills the Osterwalder-Schrader axioms gives a Wightman theory on Minkowski space via analytical continuation of the correlation function by the $URL$ E.g. a 4 dim theory gives a Wightman theory on 3+1 dim Minkowski space, so there is no additional dimension... 

(1) Let $\mathcal F$ be a spherical fusion tensor category. Then Müger showed that $R=\bigoplus_{H\in\mathrm{Irr}(\mathcal F)} H\boxtimes H^\mathrm{op}$ canonically has the structure of a Frobenius algebra in $\mathcal F \boxtimes \mathcal F^\mathrm{op}$ and that the category of bimodules ${}_R(\mathcal F \boxtimes \mathcal F^\mathrm{op})_R$ has a braiding which makes it a modular tensor category equivalent to $Z(\mathcal F)$. Further, the "dual" Frobenius algebra is $\hat Q=I(1)$, where $I$ is the induction functor, ie the adjoint of the forgetful functor $F\colon Z(\mathcal F)\to \mathcal F$. (2) Conversely, let $\mathcal C$ be a modular tensor category, then it is the center of a fusion category iff there is a Lagrangian algebra $A\in\mathcal C$, i.e. a commutative (Frobenius) algebra, such that $\dim A^2=\dim\mathcal C$. Namely, the right modules $\mathcal C_A$ have a tensor structure and $$Z(\mathcal C_A)=\mathcal C\cong\mathcal C\boxtimes \overline{\mathcal C_A^0}\cong \mathcal C\boxtimes \mathrm{Vect}\cong \mathcal C$$ Further, I conclude ${}_A\mathcal C_A\cong \mathcal C_A \boxtimes \mathcal C_A^\mathrm{op}$, because $\mathcal C_A^0\cong\mathrm{Vect}$. Question: Let $A\in\mathcal C$ be a Lagrangian algebra. I guess it is true that $A$ and $\hat A$ by (2) are in of the form as in (1), ie $A\cong I(1)$ and $\hat A\cong R$. Is there any reference for such a result, which is citable? Note: A special case when $\mathcal C \cong Z(\mathcal C_0)$ for $\mathcal C_0$ a unitary modular tensor category is contained implicitly in the subfactor literature $URL$ I am particular interested and most comfortable with the case of unitary tensor categories, so feel free to add the right adjectives. 

Let $A$ and $B$ be two models of size $\omega_1$. In both A and B, being in the same cycle is an equivalence relation. Each equivalence class has size $\omega$. So there are $\omega_1$ many equivalence classes in both A and B. Fix a bijection between the equivalence classes in A and B. You can use this to make an isomorphism between A and B because every single equivalence class in either A and B is isomorphic to every other. 

The continuum can't be weak compact. The continuum can't be a strong limit (basically by definition of a strong limit) and weak compact cardinals are always strong limits. You could start with a weakly compact cardinal in the ground model and make it the continuum by your favorite way of changing the continuum, but by the above you'll destroy the weak compactness. (Under the assumption that weak compacts are consistent, of course.) If you are just interested in getting the continuum to have the tree property, this is done in Mitchell's Aronszajn trees and the independence of the transfer property by collapsing a weak compact to $\omega_2$. 

I like to use TikZ for LaTex because it looks really clean, you have the same fonts then in the text, you can even use it easily inside formulae etc. But you have to "program" the pictures using coordinates, so it has a bit of a learning curve. Some examples of TikZ can be found here $URL$ 

At the end of Section 14.1 in Pressley, Segal "Loop Groups" there is the remark that the partition function is a modular function in the sense that the Dedekind $\eta$ function is a modular form. I am interested about the following remark: 

Take $C$ to be the category of dualizable $N$-$N$-bimoduls, $N$ a factor. A subfactor $N\subset M$ (or $N_0\subset N$) with finite index and finite depth gives an algebra object $A$ in $C$, namely $A={}_NM_N$ (or ${}_NL^2M_N$ if you prefer) and conversely an algebra object (more precisely a Q-system) gives a subfactor $N\subset M$. Instead of building artificially a category of subfactors, you take the category of (simple) algebra objects (Q-systems) in $C$. Each finite group gives an object $A_G=\bigoplus_{g\in G} {}_NN^{\circ\alpha_g}_N$ with $\alpha_g$ automorphisms on $N$ such that $\alpha_g\alpha_h=\alpha_{gh}$ for $g,h\in G$ and ${}_NN^{\circ\alpha_g}_N$ is ${}_NN_N$ seen as a $N$-$N$ bimodule, where the right action is composed with $\alpha$. A morphism $H\to G$ gives a morphism $A_H\to A_G$ between algebra object. This category contains also finite groups, their duals, Kac-algebras and weak-C${}^\ast$ Hopf algebras. If you want irreducible subfactors, you ask $A$ to be haploid, then you lose weak-C${}^\ast$ Hopf algebras. This also tells you how a "category of subfactors" should work...
