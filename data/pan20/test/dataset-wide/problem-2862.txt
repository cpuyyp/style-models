This analogy happens to have the bonus side-effect that, as most arguments so far have been based on the magnitudes of ontological contents rather than the magnitudes of ontological expanses, it now accommodates this concern by having built into it the altogether irrelevance of the magnitudes of ontological contents. So, to answer the original question, there's nothing to worry about. In comparing modern humans to dogs or to early humans with tight extremophilic analogies, ultimately no great filter to superintelligence or beyond is implied. 

But I believe there are also direct quotes from W. that relate philosophy and therapy, although I can't locate them right now. Going with this -- Wittgenstein's own -- interpretation of what philosophy really is, that is, a way of "curing" askers of philosophical questions of their "delusions", Wittgenstein's job is never finished: philosophical questions will always be asked, and on these occasions new therapy will have to be provided. 

I have listened to Dreyfus's lectures on Being and Time, Division One (see webpage), which was of considerable help in understanding the corresponding parts of Heidegger's work. However, I can't find the audio lectures for the follow-up course (webpage). I do think they have existed -- and therefore very possibly still exist somewhere -- because they are referred to on this page. (It says to look at iTunes, but I couldn't find anything there.) Any help with this would be much appreciated. 

By assuming the negation of the conclusion, you arrive at a proposition that contradicts a true premise. (We assume our premises are true when the validity, and not the soundness, of the argument is in question. If the soundness were in question then we would also want to know if the premises really are true, but the soundness is not in question right now.) If ~B leads to a contradiction, then it must be false. In classical logic, if ~B is false then B is true. What if we have all true premises and don't arrive at a contradiction by the same method? 

As far as I can see, Wittgenstein himself wouldn't have considered himself as having solved the problems of philosophy. So why would anyone else think he has? Let me elaborate. For the later Wittgenstein, philosophy was largely a form of "therapy", that cured the asker of philosophical questions of the delusions brought on by language. From the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy: 

So this is how some of the ancient philosophers solved the problem of altruism, by positing that man's nature is inherently social. It is also what Aristotle wrote in his Nicomachean Ethics: "φύσει πολιτικόν ὅ ἄνθρωπος" ("by nature, man [is] a social being"). Now for your question, this would mean that there is a definite distinction between 'pure' and 'rational altruism': namely we can either act in a manner that is entirely consistent with our self-interest, but without satisfying any sort of social nature (which in some people may exist to a much lesser degree, or otherwise may exist but for some reason be ignored) -- this is what we would colloquially term a 'selfish' or 'egotistical' personality. When someone like this acts altruistically, it will not be out of a desire to satisfy the social instinct, but will rather be 'nakedly self-interested', and we would not be inclined to call it 'pure altruism', but rather 'rational altruism'. On the other hand, when someone possesses the social instinct to the usual extent, he or she can act in accordance with their social nature. If such a person acts altruistically, this is then what is commonly known as 'pure altruism'. 

It can be done in one step. The first man sees two white hats and says that he knows. But, you say, the problem says that the first man says "I don't know"? Exactly. The problem's definition is also specified by the second man saying "I don't know." Therefore, if you can break the definition of the problem for your two steps, I can break the definition of the problem for my one step. ... 

A dog's ontology is presumably quite limited. A human's ontology is apparently maximal. While our average intelligence is quite a bit more than it is for dogs, it's not "godly" by comparison (maybe "demi-godly" but not godly, since for instance we can't create dogs from raw materials right now). But our ontology is maximal. If the analogy should carry over, as it seems it should, as in 

I think this is a great passage. I am also wondering: is this threefold structuring of the act of questioning an original idea by Heidegger, or is he taking his cue from some earlier thinker(s), for example from medieval philosophy? (Somehow, to me, the threefold partition has a medieval ring about it.) Edit: in his book Making Sense of Heidegger, Thomas Sheehan discusses the threefold structure quite extensively (starting on p. 13), calling it "the three moments of any question". He claims that the Befragtes is "what medieval Scholasticism called the obiectum materiale quod or material object". Other than that, though, he does not give any indication that any writers before Heidegger have adopted the same threefold subdivision. 

It doesn't seem difficult to determine the appropriate nature of our mind-to-world intentional states. Their appropriate nature is that they match accurately and precisely to the world, perhaps maximally so (except where perhaps this doesn't infringe excessively on most others' privacy). It feels as if this is an obvious and undeniable logical definition. However, it seems much more difficult to determine the appropriate nature of our world-to-mind intentional states. Their appropriate nature is... what? While one good first answer might be that their appropriate nature is that they reflect end-states that already have well-defined routines for satisfying them, we know this answer comes up short. We regularly see people solve problems that at least in large part had no known well-defined routines for satisfying them. This meant that they posed a problem that hadn't been posed exactly like it before (or finally solved one that had been such an open problem). What exactly is the permissibilic mechanism for people to pose unique (previously unsatisfied) problems, unique world-to-mind intentional states? Sometimes people pose unique problems and other people like them for it, and sometimes people pose unique problems and other people hate them for it. Many people act as though they have a thoroughgoing familiarity of the permissibilic mechanism, that here too there's an obvious and undeniable logical definition in effect. But where's the manual – or what is it like – on the necessary and sufficient constraints on posing previously unsatisfied problems, on formulating previously unsatisfied world-to-mind intentional states? 

In section 2 of Being and Time, Heidegger discusses "what belongs to a question in general". In particular, he writes (transl. by Joan Stambaugh) 

Apologies for the somewhat sordid nature of this question, but I have spent quite some time looking for this already, with no result. 

Personally, I generally feel that defining terms like 'altruism' by casting them in the mould of a mathematical theory (such as game theory) diminishes their essence. It is a sort of reductionism, and an altogether wrong sort if you ask me. For most people learn the term 'altruism' at a relatively young age -- for example as the opposite of 'egoism', as was the case for me. So that then is its true definition, i.e. the definition under which we have acquired the concept, have established its basic properties and relationships with other concepts, have learnt to reason with it, etc. To recast the concept in terms of a mathematical theory denies all this, and moreover denies the non-mathematical and pre-mathematical parts of our faculty of reason. This is what I mean by reductionism: to pretend that all our thinking is either mathematical, or residing in some state of imperfection from which it can only be saved if it is subsequently "mathematized". Having said all that, let me apologize for being so opinionated on this subject (and me, a mathematician). I just wrote this as a defense for quoting a stoic writer on the subject of altruism. There is a 'real' problem here, in the sense that serious philosophers have felt the need to address it at least from Aristotle onwards, namely the question whether 'pure' altruism exists. I think it is extremely enlightening to consider what the ancients said on this subject. So in the Discourses of Epictetus, written down by Arrian, we find: 

I can see the power behind the argument because to get around it a person would either have to stretch the imagination into areas that might seem implausible or have to solve a lot of academic problems, if the person is to be satisfied that Mary has all the facts and that all the facts are physical facts. Foregoing the route of solving a lot of academic problems for now, I think we can continue to think about Mary in a way that derives directly from your formulation, RECURSIVE FARTS. The original Mary is characterized with the standard scientific kind, as having descriptive knowledge. If it's implied that she has procedural knowledge, which standardly tends to be an engineering kind, it's not very much. In domains where descriptive knowledge is enough, interfacing with things around you tends to be enough. You don't need to begin an approach to knowing the inner workings of things to the extent of knowing how to reconstruct them or something like them. That is, you don't need to begin an approach that's pointed to knowing things in themselves. At most, you'd need to know enough to create simulations, which, while a lot of times very sophisticated, is not the same. But descriptive knowledge isn't always enough in all domains where physical knowledge is required. Additional knowledge is required to assemble basic components (which are usually for larger systems). Without getting into whether or not Mary has the "right kind" of knowledge about colors, we can already say she lacks some physical knowledge. That is, she doesn't know how to assemble basic components. Or, at least, she doesn't have the facilities to assemble basic components and gain the knowledge of herself going through the process of assembling the basic components. Indeed, this would be just like you said, this would be a posteriori knowledge, RECURSIVE FARTS(). Now that we may begin to question the sobriety of the original caricature of Mary, we may be able to close in on settling the issue. Even letting alone the question of the life-changing subjective quality of strolling through the wilderness, we know that as it stands Mary neither has enough knowledge ab intra nor has enough knowledge a fortiori. However, provided proper education and further facilities, whether industrial or surgically integrated with her body, she would simply demonstrate her sufficiently complete knowledge of the physical world. First she would make basic nanoconstructors. Then she would make physical replicas of everyday inanimate objects. Then she would make physical replicas of archaea. (...) And finally, for now, she would give you a neural implant to complement hers for bidirectional communication of art works and anything else that could be seen in virtual reality. Of course, the tests she had to perform to get such magic right must've involved having knowledge of the physical world to such a degree that it went much beyond descriptive knowledge, and into its superset of acquaintance knowledge. Having physical descriptive knowledge is simply not the only kind of physical knowledge to have.
