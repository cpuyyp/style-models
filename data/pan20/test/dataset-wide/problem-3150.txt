It's possible I misunderstood what the Wikipedia article said: according to a google book search, the True Whig Party was the political organisation of dark-skinned Americo-Liberians, who were believed to be of 100% African ancestry. It seems the Republican Party was the party of light-skinned, apparently mixed race Americo-Liberians, who were called mullato people at the time. The source is below, any other information would be welcome. $URL$ 

According to my university lecturer* all those years ago, the main problem was not propaganda, it was accounting errors. In advanced economies, they would use value-addedd accounting. For instance, if one factory assembled a car, this would be recorded as them creating (say) £2000. If they sent it to another factory and they painted the car and increased its value to £2500, this would be counted as £2000 + £500 = £2500. In the USSR this would be counted as £2000 + £2500 = £4500. *I don't have a reference but the fellow's name was Gareth Pritchard. 

One of the main cod-justifications for slavery was to convert the slaves to Christianity: they called slavery 'opening the gates of mercy'. It's doubtful that any Muslim slaves were allowed to remain Muslim. There were very few black Muslims in America until the nation of Islam was founded, and its members were sui generis converts. 

Not sure if this is too recent to be a history question, but... All this stuff about Saddam collaborating on the World Trade Centre attack has been shown to be humbug over and over again. The two countries bordered Iran, which was their bitter enemy. Did they try to join forces against it? Or were they enemies themselves, given their different outlooks? It doesn't seem possible for them to just ignore each other. To be clear, we're talking about the period 1996-2001, when the Taliban were in control of Afghanistan. Edit: I would like well sourced answers. Primary sources or academic sources, in other words. 

Political parties exist in every country that has elections. America has elections, and there is nothing special about America. The question that you should ask is why does a representative system always lead to political parties? A few dictatorships don't have them, but there is no election-based country that has no parties, even if the country is not fully democratic. 

There are many accounts of Europeans who travelled to the Far East, as they called it. There were some Chinese people who made the opposite journey, did anyone from Japan do it? If they returned to Japan, what did they report about these faraway countries? 

There's a book named Eastern Approaches by a British commando called Fitzroy Maclean, who was attached to the Yugoslav partisans. I'm quoting from memory, but the gist is: 

Traders, soldiers, officials. If we confine things to Europe, those are the only people who traveled a long distance. Taking them in turn, travelling by sea took you the furthest, and it was traders who did this the most. Wars generally happened between neighbouring countries or within a country, so soldiers usually did not travel much, although they did occasionally have to go long distances. Officials might have to travel within a country to assess taxes and the like, or occasionally (rarely) on diplomatic missions to foreign countries. So, everyone who was not one of these didn't travel much. You would need to find out the proportion of people who were not traders, soldiers, or officials. It will be most people. Wandering day labourers, friars and thieves would have to move about a fair bit. They would generally stay within one area, but their life would involve a lot of walking. 

"History from below" is an example of attempts to write the history of ordinary people. This particular approach was a reaction by leftwing historians against the prevailing interpretation of Marxist history, which viewed people as the passive vessels of economic forces. 

The term people's republic was coined by the loyalist side in the Spanish civil war. It was intended to suggest a republic which would guarantee the welfare of all its citizens; their economic rights as well as political. It was adopted by the east European countries, as a supposed third way between bourgeois democracy and the dictatorship of the proletariat. Of course now we know that all the coalitions were just a stepping stone to communist takeover. Presumably the non-communists who used the term, like Eduard Benes of Czechoslovakia, were sincere when they used it. Edit: a user pointed out that Ukraine and Belarus called themselves people's republics during their brief independence from ~1917 to ~1922. In the same period, several countries, including Azerbaijan, Georgia and Hungary called themselves democratic repulbic. All of these countries were more or less genuine democracies, as much as the war and general chaos would allow, but none of them survived. So to answer your question, before ww2 if a country called itself democratic, it probably was. After ww2, it probably wasn't. 

As far as imperial strength was concerned, people used the term 'splendid isolation' in Britain. In France, the economic and technological advancement there was called 'la belle epoque'. I can't think of a term which specifically means a belief in never ending progress, sorry. 

Kazakhstan used a Latin alphabet until the Soviets forced them to use Cyrillic, the same was probably true in other central Asian countries. So it is quite likely to be true, yes. Source: I used to live in Kazakhstan. 

The Spanish Civil War is an example of loser-dominated historiography. That the Rebels won is beyond doubt, but the Loyalists wrote all the history... it's hard to think of a history of the war which is sympathetic to the winning side. 

In the late 60s to early 70s, the groups had a fairly similar ideology. They were both black nationalist. NOI had religious overtones, whereas the BPP didn't. Did they have strength in the same cities? Were they allies or opponents? 

This is unsourced but lines up with what the book says. However beware the writer's trick of announcing a general rule with 'for example' as if they have hundreds of examples, when really they only have one. Even (especially) professional historians are guilty of this. 

The Protestant Reformation turned society upside down in countries under the aegis of the Vatican, but did anybody pay any attention in Orthodox countries? If so, who did they side with? 

The Bishops war between the Covenanters and the Episcopals, in 17th century Scotland. I stand to be corrected, but I don't think the Covenanters had a candidate to replace Charles. So we can say that they accepted he was head of state. The English were against the Covenanters (although it was more complicated than that). England and Scotland had separate parliaments. I'm not sure that we can speak of separate state and government at this time, though. 

Lee Harvey Oswald moved to the USSR for political reasons. However, he found the USSR no more to his liking, because he was mental and was not going to be satisfied by anything. He soon moved back. There was a book about American victims of Stalin who moved to the USSR for ideological reasons before WW2. Predictably they found it uncongenial, but the American Embassy refused to help them emigrate back home... :/ There is a review of the book here (paywall). 

I know Napoleon's senate was appointed, but what about the lower house? Were there political factions like in the first republic? 

Flags were used as a standard in battle. Red is an arresting colour for mammals and birds, which is why most ripe fruit is red. You can imagine that red is likely to be more visible and less likely to blend in than blue or white (sky) grey or black (smoke) or green or brown (trees, landscape etc.) 

Were all Tories part of the Country 'party'? Were some of them part of the court party? What was the distinction between Country and non-Country Tories, if there were any? 

It's often said the peace was only both sides buying time. There's ample evidence Hitler always intended to break the pact. Did Stalin? Suvorov's thesis that Stalin was preparing for an offensive against Germany has been debunked. Stalin's actions (such as shooting agents who reported threatening German troop movements, as British spies) suggest to me that he did not have plans to attack Germany, nor did he anticipate a German attack. 

I will address race in the west European middle ages, since identity is just too broad to be answered. First of all it is very important to put yourself in the position of a medieval villein, which is what most people were. They usually did not leave the village where they were born. They would know their immediate family, some of the seigneur's officials, and the local priest, whose economic situation was likely to be similar to their own. They would not meet any foreigners, unless their overlords happened to be foreigners (such as the Normans in England, for example.) The educated classes of people were a little different. Their main preocuppation would be alliegance to a dynasty as identity. This overlapped with national identity, but was far from contiguous with it. The other Europeans they compared themselves with were, of course, also light-skinned, light-haired, light-eyed. As far as darker-skinned people were concerned, they did not constantly intrude on European thoughts. Educated Europeans were influenced by the old Roman conception of race, which was that Romans were civilised, mediterranean people were civilised, and people from central Asia, sub-saharan Africa, or northern Europe were barbarians. Note that 'barbarians' weren't defined by skin colour. Medieval scholars and governments viewed themselves as to some extent the heirs to Roman civilisation. The idea of Roman civilisation became fused somewhat with christianity, since the end of the Roman empire was christian, and the papacy in Rome was (and is still) a holdover from the Roman empire. Before they were brutally subjected to Christian rule, light-skinned people in scandinavia, the Baltics and northern Russia were considered barbarians. They became 'civilized' races after that. Note also that 'Christian' meant a Roman Catholic. Eastern Orthodox Christians were often treated just as badly by Catholic conquerers as Muslim or Jewish subjects had been. The ancestor of modern racism is the European global empires of a much later date. Black people were slaves, Indians etc were virtual slaves, Chinese people were under the thumb of colonial powers, etc. These ideas wouldn't make any sense to the medieval European. 

A horse's teeth is one way to determine its age. So you should look at the teeth if you're buying it. If it's a gift, free, then there's no point in looking. You won't lose anything if it's old, and the giver might get offended and retract his offer. 

During Japan's transition from democracy to ultranationalist dictatorship, did they hold up the Nazis as a model, or was that not something they mentioned/thought about? EDIT: The question wanted for clarity. Let me try again. The period from 1912 to 1926 is sometimes known as the Taisho democracy. At any rate it was more democratic than 1930s-1945 Japan. Whether you accept that the Taisho period was real democracy or not, its downfall merits an explanation. Someone objected to my characterisation of wartime Japan as an ultranationalist dictatorship. I think the facts of a genocidal war against the rest of Asia really speak for themselves there, and I have nothing to add to them. Lastly, Hitler was world famous after the Beer Hall Putsch in 1923, and came to power in 1933. The decisive military takeover in Japan happened in 1936 (February 26 Incident). That leaves plenty of time for people to have noticed and reacted to developments in Germany. 

All over Europe, there are monuments of stone such as stonehenge, although many are not so grand as stonehenge is. Contra Asterix, the Celts didn't carve out menhirs and things like that. The stones were already there by the time the Celtic culture came into being. In medieval times people linked them with Bible stories about the giants that used to roam the earth... says Wikipedia, anyhow. What did people think about them in ancient, historical times? Did the Romans have any thoughts on who built structures like stonehenge, and for what purpose? 

This is from the Bill of Rights $URL$ Was this defence just against robbers and the like, or was it political? What conditions were relevant, and what law governed the possession of arms? Was this on an individual basis, in a government-controlled militia, or somewhere in between? 

Maoism and Trotskyism share some similar ideas (by Maoism I am referring specifically to the guiding philosophies of the PRC during Mao's rule, and by Trotskyism I mean the beliefs of Trotsky, not whatever sixth-formers believe right now). Both wanted 'permanent revolution', which Mao attempted to practice with appalling results. Both were very keen on spreading the revolution, as opposed to Stalin's isolationism. However, Stalin was venerated in China as a way of denigrating Khrushchev. Propaganda-wise, I suppose you can't really have both Stalin and Trotsky as icons. Did the PRC use Trotsky as a hate-figure in their propaganda, notwithstanding the parallels between its own ideology and his, or did they just ignore him? 

Because the Allies didn't consider them a threat. Ideology was important, but it was secondary to security. If we define Fascist as right wing dictatorship, this could be applied to some of the countries Hitler annexed, and even some Allies. Austria was a right wing dictatorship, and so was Poland. So was Greece, Yugoslavia... whether these countries were Fascist is a moot point, but it's incoherent to call Franco fascist and not call Metaxas fascist.
