It's possible that your boss took this in the joking way that your dad inferred. Nevertheless, if it's bothering you then that's as good a reason to sit down and talk this out at work. Explain to them the truth about the situation as truthfully as you can (my one admonishment would be to avoid throwing your dad under the bus; just maybe say that he has an "off the wall sense of humor" or something along those lines), including that you in fact think they are a very intelligent person and you are grateful for their tutelage. My experience is that people like to be complimented, and even if there's no lingering bad feelings from that conversation, hashing this out has nothing, I don't think, but good consequences for you. 

Software development, I think, is a very specific situation because unlike a lot of other jobs there are a lot of people out there who can give a good interview and might even have even memorized enough tricks to pass a short competency test, but when it comes down to it can't actually develop software. To an extent you should always feel as an SDEV that you begin a job on a probationary period. The companies that spell it out might have been burned in the past, but I've definitely worked at places where people were given a month or even six months to work out whatever they were going to do before they were let go, even with no probationary period in place. I think that if you can write code then you're probably OK, and if you can't then you probably are not. Otherwise, I would use other criteria than this one to determine if the place is a good fit for you. If it seems overly competitive or there are signs that management is not nice (perhaps there's a high turnover rate, maybe it's just a vibe you get during the interview) then that "probationary period" might in fact be a big red flag, but even there the red flag isn't so much in the probation, it's I will say that if you're familiar with a particular stack and you're moving out of that particular stack, you might want to make clear where your strengths and weaknesses are heading in. If a company has that "let's see how this person does for 3 months before granting them a FT position" outlook at the forefront, you positioned yourself as a front-end ace in the interview, and you struggle off the bat with a website set up in Angular, then that's going to look a lot worse than if you admit that you don't have experience with that particular framework. The flip side of that is that the company may decide not to hire you in favor of someone else who does claim to be an ace (who in turn may not be truthful). Good salesmanship is key here. The final thing that I would be most concerned about in your position is if the company in question is hiring, say, 2 devs to fill one slot with the intention that the poorer performing one will be shown the door. Honestly, I have not really seen this happen in practice - good devs are too hard to find to alienate one by doing that, and besides, companies tend to be too cheap to pay for 2 guys for 3 months knowing that they really only want one of them - but it's probably a thing I'd stay away from personally. 

The definitive answer that I have is... sort of. No, you're not necessarily going to learn, like, OOP techniques in a group situation which you could never have learned on your own, but there are still a number of things you can learn in a team setting: 

To the unanswered question of how you, the prospective employee, handle this, I would attempt to head things off at the pass. If you're concerned that people will see all of your experience and assume you're stuck in your ways, come to the interview prepared to talk about that new technique you've learned. If you keep getting fired from jobs, don't try to blame multiple firings on people other than yourself; ideally you want to try to pinpoint what you were doing wrong, fix it, and outline how it is that you fixed it. If you just need the job, you probably owe it to the other company to tell them this - if they're hiring in the industry they probably know if times are tight. You might not get a job you were planning on quitting in six months anyway but at the same time that company might find opportunities for you come in humble and ready to work. In a sense, "you are overqualified" is one of the worst cliches in the business of business. It almost always means something other than "we think you are too qualified for the job at hand and think you will do too well at it". Your key as a potentially overqualified person is to figure out what they really mean by that phrase and speak to it instead of the stated concern. 

You could, if you wanted, even include details about any minor subjects you're studying, if you feel they might be relevant, and maybe your current GPA or any other relevant academic performance metrics. The important questions to ask yourself, with regard to any extra pieces of information are: 

Whatever else you do, apply for the position anyway. Make it clear in your application that, while your physical disability prevents you from performing offsite tasks, you have already demonstrated competence in the other parts of the job while in your current contract position. What you need to keep in mind is that a job posting is essentially an advertisement, and everything in it can be subject to negotiation. Yes, the employer is saying they're looking for two full-time programmers who also do some offsite support — but they may be perfectly willing to settle for one full-time programmer who cannot do offsite work, and one who will do a little more, especially if the first programmer is already known to them and familiar with the job. Sure, if they really just don't want to re-hire you for some reason, and have worded the new positions deliberately to exclude you, then doing this won't help. (In that case, you might also indeed have cause to sue; but you'd need to talk to a local lawyer about that.) However, if that's not the case — and the fact that they extended your contract suggests it may be so — then they may well be glad to have you apply, even if you don't technically satisfy all the stated requirements. Approaching the person who'll actually be doing the hiring (that is to say, not the HR person who posted the ad, but whoever you'd actually be working for if you got the job), as littlekellilee suggests, may also be a good idea. Make sure not to come across in any way demanding or confrontational, but just mention that you heard about the new positions, and that you'd like to know more about the offsite work aspects so that you can decide if you should apply. At least, this will let them know that you're interested in a permanent position, which could be useful even if you don't end up getting this particular job (e.g. because they really do specifically need more offsite support staff). 

However, if you're looking for work in a field related to your studies, it's quite plausible that your prospective employers might be interesting in knowing a bit more about your studies than just the fact that you'll hopefully have a diploma some day. As such, you could also consider fleshing out the entry to something like, say: 

*) Placeholders for unknown major / institute / town / year / etc. **) Or maybe a B.Sc. or a Ph.D. or some other degree. 

However, you'd like to apply for work while studying, and you're wondering how to describe your ongoing studies in your current rèsumè. If so, the direct answer is: any way you like, as long as it's factually correct to the best of your knowledge. For instance, you'd be perfectly fine listing it simply as: 

I'd say you absolutely need to talk about this with your line manager. It sounds like the fundamental problem is that both you and your line manager are (or are perceived to be) responsible for allocating resources to different projects, but, despite your mutual discussions, you end up disagreeing with each other in front of higher management and failing to present a consistent position. If so, you really need to sit down with your line manager to figure out why this happens and to come up with workable strategies for preventing it in the future. In particular, you really should ask your line manager for their viewpoint on the matter; they may well be equally annoyed with you for, say, failing to be properly accommodating towards upper management requests. For the future, once you've both raised your concerns and agreed that there's a problem, you should try to come up with some way to present a consistent front. There are many possible ways you could do that, from planning in advance your mutual responses to any likely upper management requests, to agreeing on definitive, non-overlapping areas of authority, so that you can simply pass any requests not in your designated area of authority to your line manager (and vice versa). 

I think that this actually ends up being one of the most important parts of being a middle manager. "Ethan" (probably rightly) does not feel that he has the authority to speak up directly to "Mary", and might even feel that you tacitly agree with her if you aren't constantly undercutting what she's saying (which has its own set of issues). Unfortunately I think the only real option here - at least the one which has the most chance of any level of real success - is to confront "Mary" about this situation and see if she has it in herself to change. I realize that this is probably the last thing you want to do - confrontation is never easy - but I actually think that you can use that. Approach this as a tough conversation you're only having with "Mary" because you have to have it and I think you'll begin to be on the right track. In the conversation itself, even though it is literally a confrontation I also think that it's important not to be too confrontational. People have a tendency to get defensive and double down when they feel they are being told they are doing a core aspect of their job duties incorrectly, and I would not expect a person with a record of being condescending to be any less so here. Talk about the situation in terms of how it impacts you and, secondarily, "Ethan" instead of how her behaviors are bad and need to be changed. And try to come at this from a standpoint that you have an issue that you would like her help in brainstorming a resolution to. "Yesterday I noticed that following a conversation that you had with 'Ethan', he was visibly frustrated. Fortunately he is a professional and his production was not negatively affected by this, but I feel that if this continues, 'Ethan' will leave us for a less stressful environment. What do you think I should do about this?" Now, that being said, I think there are a few ways this could work out, not all of which, unfortunately, are going to be satisfying to you: 

Reading between the lines, what this really sounds like is that the second company does stuff that seems more exciting to you but your current job gives you a paycheck you can count on, so you want both. Unfortunately, you can't always have everything that you want and I think this is going to end up being one of those times. At the same time, if you think you're going to like the other job better, why not take the leap? Perhaps try and find a way to make a gracious exit from the first place, because usually the development industry in a given city is small and you don't want to burn bridges (and hey, worst case scenario, maybe you can get the old job back if the new one doesn't work out). I just think that what you seem to be angling for as a "compromise" is going to be a solution that leaves nobody happy, least of all yourself. 

There are basically two ways of looking at this. Your perspective, where on principle you are working that day and therefore ought to be compensated, is not wrong per se. The issue here is that you ostensibly want to be hired at this place, so what you really need to do is look at this from the employer's standpoint. You are probably not the only person being interviewed for this gig and even if you are they aren't actually getting production out of you just yet. They are, in all likelihood, not going to want to pay you, and if the, say, 9 other applicants aren't asking for compensation, that could well be reason enough to tell you not to bother going in at all. Another thing to take into account is that "all day" interviews are often not the entire day. I have, sadly, had interviews in the past (including one where the prospective employer flew me across the country at their expense) that were set up to be all day but wound up lasting only a couple hours before we decided we were not a mutual fit and exited early. From the interviewer's perspective, that's an even greater reason not to want to compensate you for a full day: why do so for a person they've decided not to hire anyway, when they could at least theoretically still go back to their job for half a day or what have you? It is an audition, of course, for both sides, and so if you feel that you cannot work for a company that interviews you for an entire day but won't pay you, then it is certainly within your realm of ability to decline the interview. I would not personally use this as a reason to decline, as a lot of employers do this nowadays and you're just going to be excluding yourself from a lot of jobs, but ultimately that's your decision, not mine.
