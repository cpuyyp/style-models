It is helpful to distinguish two questions here: one logical and the other epistemological. If you ask, what is the logical status of a proffered deductive proof of some proposition, then it is either valid or not. It doesn't matter whether the proof was generated by a human mind, a computer, or an explosion in a print factory. But often, we are interested in the epistemological question: how can we be sure this proof is correct? There are plenty of valid proofs that are very difficult to comprehend: for example, few people know enough math to understand the proof of Fermat's last theorem. Also, there are proofs of theorems that are so long and complex that it is likely that no single person has ever read them from beginning to end: the classification theorem in group theory is one such - it runs to tens of thousands of pages of work across hundreds of published papers by about a hundred different mathematicians. When a proof is as difficult as this, it makes sense to enlist the help of automated provers. But it does not completely solve the problem of how to be sure, because we still need assurance that the prover itself is correct. Since the prover is a physical embodiment of a formal proof system, Godel's second incompleteness theorem applies to it: it cannot prove its own consistency. Also, the prover is implemented in hardware and software and we cannot prove there are no errors in the implementation (although formal systems such as Z notation can help). So to return to your question about Hume, I would say any proof logically conforms to what Hume calls relations of ideas and so is a priori, at least in principle. But there is a hard-headed pragmatic element to Hume's thinking that makes one suspect that he might regard output from a computer as just a kind of empirical evidence. So maybe he would regard a generated proof as a posteriori until it has been internalised and comprehended. 

As you already know, being a user on Buddhism.SE, that (i.e. ending suffering) is the central theme of the Buddhist doctrine, for example as it's described in many of the suttas of the Pali canon. To address the comments, just while I'm here: 

Writing this answer reminds me of Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance ... in which, about two thirds of the way through the book, the protagonist becomes angry to discover that "What is good?" is not considered the central question of philosophy, but was somehow demoted by Aristotle to a sub-sub-category, of "logic" or something like that. 

So my real question is this: is the pro choice movement hijacking this debate by arguing from adverse consequences, and by appealing to women to get enough votes to push the issue through without thinking about the only real issue on the table: life? Well if you're asking, I would say no, that your premise is flawed: 

The converse is true, i.e.: "If assuming that a premise is true leads to a paradox, that shows that the premise isn't true." There are mathematical proofs that work like this: Wikipedia calls it proof by contradiction. For example, "How can we prove that the square root of 2 is irrational? Well, assume that it's rational. Then, (see Pythagorean Theorem Proof which shows that if it is rational then a paradox exists). Therefore (to avoid the paradox) the premise (that it is rational) cannot be true: therefore Q. E. D." 

The "middle way" is the way between two extremes, one extreme being hedonism and another being asceticism. I think there's a phrase in the West, "eat to live, not live to eat". Hinduism includes a word atman which means more than just 'self': I think it means 'eternal self' or soul. Buddhism includes a word anatman i.e. 'not atman'. I like to translate that not as 'no self' but as 'no eternal self'. There are a couple of things you ought to notice about the five skandhas which you listed: 

With proofs, there is always more than one way to skin the cat. Your proof proceeds to derive F and ¬F, but there are other ways it could have worked. For example, from 14 and 10 you can prove H by MP, but you also have ¬H at 11, so you have proved H and ¬H. Or alternatively, from 13 and 12 you can prove ¬B by MT, which combined with 9 gives you B and ¬B. Or again, from ¬B and 1 you can prove ¬R by MT which combined with 8 gives you R and ¬R. So there is no particular unique contradiction that must be found, and it would be misleading to say that F is the cause of the contradiction. With proofs by reductio, as soon as you assume the negation of the conclusion you have created an inconsistent set of sentences, so anything follows by the principle of explosion. You have only to locate a contradiction somewhere and your proof is done. 

Others have already pointed out that this argument begs the question against the possibility of compatibilism, by supposing that freedom must be contra-determinate. Also that it potentially asserts a false dichotomy. Another point is that McGinn moves from "indeterminism" to "merely random event" and thence to "inexplicable lurches". This move pivots on an equivocation in the meaning of the word "random". In scientific use, randomness relates to stochastic processes: in this sense it is OK to infer random from indeterminate. But in ordinary usage, when we say something is random we mean it is unplanned or unintended. It is only in this sense that we can get from random to inexplicable. Stochastic processes needn't be unplanned, unintended or inexplicable. In fact, we use (pseudo) random number generators to solve problems such as in Monte Carlo calculations. The results of these calculations are the product of stochastic processes, but they are not inexplicable. This is an example of a fairly common error in which randomness is reified and treated as a cause. 

There's a well-known expression, "you can't step into the same river twice." (perhaps attributed to Heraclitus). You may be introducing an extra confusion when you say that "a thing has changed", or that "some specific change is a permanent property of some thing": because in reality the changed thing isn't the same thing as the previous thing (see the Ship of Theseus). 

The logic of the paradox in the OP depends on "zero multiplied by infinity equals zero" (i.e. zero-probability-per-point multiplied by infinite-points equals a paradox). You get that equation by doing a division-by-zero, "one divided by zero equals infinity" (i.e. finite-area-of-the-table divided by the size-of-a-zero-area point equals infinitely many points). But "division by zero" is an undefined operation. Using it results in well-known, trivial (grade-school level), easily recogizable algebraic fallacies, for example as shown here: Division by zero -- Fallacies It doesn't prove anything about the universe, it's pushing the numbering system until it stalls. You can divide one by n, where n is any non-zero number. 

Are you making some kind of religion out of science? Why are you taking, as the subject of your argument, what you yourself describe as "metaphysical" topics in science (cosmology and quantum mechanics)? If these don't "lead to welfare & happiness" (I studied them at university, and I'm not sure they do), why not choose other topics (scientific fields) which matter more, which have more practical/tangible/beneficial/knowable consequences? Alternatively do you know the physics or history-of-physics (not "metaphysics") well enough, that you could explain to a clever 12-year-old (who is curious but uneducated) what experimental/experiential observations led people to develop theories like "Big Bang" etc.? 

I don't see how in general proof could entail explanation, because they are rather different things. An explanation is something that answers a "why?" question. A proof is a demonstration that some premises entail a conclusion, usually (but not necessarily) within the context of a formal system of axioms and rules. The two don't have to coincide. A proof can be explanatory. If I want to know why Q is true and someone shows me that Q follows from A, B and C, which I already believe, then this might be highly informative for me. But a proof can be quite trivial and have no explanatory value at all. A proof may, for example, proceed using axioms or premises that are too 'close' to the conclusion and might therefore be considered to be begging the question. In first order predicate logic, one can prove that something exists (because the universe of discourse is stipulated to be non-empty) but this doesn't explain why something exists. If I'm allowed to construct any logic I choose, I could select some axioms from which I could prove the existence of rice pudding and income tax, but it doesn't follow that this would explain anything. At the risk of engaging in psychologism, which is controversial in logic, an explanation seems to involve imparting knowledge. If I possess an explanation of why A, B and C entails Q, I know something useful and informative about the relationship: perhaps that it is an instance of a much broader pattern of logical relationships, or that it fits in with other mathematical knowledge that I have. A proof may be much more limited than this, and fail to extend my knowledge in this way. Your reference to computerised theorem provers is also relevant. I can remember a distinguished mathematician complaining that they are not as useful as people suppose, because what we want to know is not merely that a theorem is true, but why it is true. I think he was making the same point. As to counterexamples, I suspect that like proofs they may be explanatory but not always. A counterexample might generalise in a useful way and be explanatory. But suppose somebody discovered an even number that was a counterexample to Goldbach and published it. Would that explain anything? It might perhaps, to an expert in number theory, but it might lack any explanatory value. 

The lead-in to the Sutta also describes the Dhamma (doctrine) as famous for being "admirable in the beginning, admirable in the middle, admirable in the end": which means that it's admirable when you start to learn it, admirable when you practice it, and still admirable when you have perfected it. 

These take the same adjective but are not the same "things". Your adding the noun "life" in your statements lets you say, "A and B are both human life, C and D are not human life", which lets you equate A and B. But notwithstanding your equation they're still not the same thing. I suspect that "a fetus is a human being" implies some type of reification. Statements like "all human lives are equal valuable and equally protected" is only more-or-less true, and in limited/specific circumstances. For example people are naturally inclined to protect their family and friends more than they protect strangers and enemies. And for example the national law (in many though not all countries) is more inclined to protect post-birth independent human life more than pre-birth non-independent human life. 

That says that a "prime cause" isn't "evident". Conversely Buddhism encourages people to consider what is evident. I think it's a good answer. The doctrine (the "dhamma") implies that some questions don't have good answers: that the question or topic causes confusion and a tangle or thicket of views -- see The unanswered questions -- and this question (i.e. of whether or not the world is infinite) is one of them. 

For that reason a Buddhist might say, "I don't see an atman (i.e. an eternal and independent self or soul) in the skandhas, i.e. in the body or in the consciousness or in the sensations or etc." Buddhism furthermore teaches that views about "self" are a source of dukkha (which means 'suffering' and/or 'unsatisfactoriness'): views like "this is me" and "this is mine" are unastisfactory e.g. because of illness and death etc. The Dalai Lama said that he prefers to think of himself as being a human like any other; that if he thinks of himself as special, as being "the" Dalai Lama, as being "the" Nobel Prize winner, then that thinking "imprisons" him. Buddhism recommends not being 'attached' to things (because the 'Second Noble Truth' is that attachment is the cause of suffering). Becoming detached from a view of self is part of the first stage of enlightenment. 

An assumption - at least in a philosophical context - is typically a presupposition, often unstated. One person makes a statement and another objects that for this to be plausible something else is being presupposed. Philosophers are often good at identifying assumptions made by other people - it comes with the territory :) Generally speaking, it is better to have fewer or weaker assumptions, because there is less for an opponent to object to. An assumption might be weaker because it carries a smaller ontological commitment, or it avoids entailing a disputed proposition or relationship, or because it is just simpler. A major part of philosophy is concerned with the issue of identifying and scrutinising the assumptions behind statements - at least with philosophy in the analytic tradition. If there were an answer to your question, "how do I know how many assumptions are there..." it would imply the existence of a mechanical process for doing philosophical analysis. In practice, the process of analysis is far from mechanical. Often we only realise that there is a problem with a statement when we discover later that it leads to a falsehood, or a conflict or a confusion. Sometimes this discovery comes from new data, sometimes from thought experiments, sometimes from trying to resolve paradoxes, sometimes from trying to reconcile insights and theories from different branches of knowledge. Often, even terms and ideas that we thought were simple and unproblematic turn out to require significant analysis in order to bring clarity to a problem. But we can't tell in advance how much analysis we'll need or what assumptions we will find in future. These are simply part and parcel of the process of expanding our knowledge and understanding of the world.
