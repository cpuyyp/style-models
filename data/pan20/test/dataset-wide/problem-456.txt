You may find better success with narrower tires (or alternatively, wider rims), and as suggested by Daniel R Hicks, "the narrowest tube you can find that claims to fit your tire." 

No. For patching punctured innertubes, you must use vulcanizing rubber cement. Vulcanization which crosslinks the polymers in the tube with those in the patch. Most types of rubber cement, which are used for crafts, are not vulcanizing. Aluminum rim cement is designed to bond aluminum, not to vulcanize rubber. 

Ordinary prescription glasses are sufficient but suboptimal. Although I agree that the best answer is to get bike glasses with prescription lenses or contact lenses, waiting to get optimal eyewear is no reason to avoid using a road bike. I wear prescription glasses and have not yet budgeted for cycling glasses, but I have not had any major problems. Cycling glasses would make the biggest difference when you are riding above 20 mph. If you normally ride slower than this, or if you don't have the budget, then you can wait until later to get cycling glasses or goggles. EDIT: Several months ago, I finally switched to contact lenses, and they have made a huge difference. In particular, the wide field of view afforded by contacts with cycling glasses is much better than what I might hope for in all but the most expensive prescription cycling glasses. I believe that switching to contacts was much easier (and much cheaper) than trying to find prescription cycling goggles with a wide field of view. I still think it's better to ride than to wait for the perfect solution, but getting contacts and a decent pair of cycling glasses was surprisingly easy. I switched to contacts primarily because of cycling, and I'm glad I made the change. 

With this budget, a used bike will get you the best bang for your buck. I was able to find a ten to fifteen year old road bike with good components (Ultegra) and an aluminum frame for around $600. A friend found a twenty to thirty year old road bike with a steel frame and downtube shifters for around $300. Both were in good condition and have high quality components, with the age of the bikes being the main sacrifice. If you're looking for a nice road bike, you can do it with your budget as long as you're willing to go used, but a new bike in this price range will just disappoint you. 

Yes, the Acera 8-speed cassette that you link to should be compatible with an 8-speed Deore deailleur and shifters. The main compatibility issue is the spacing of sprockets, which changes with the number of sprockets and can vary between manufacturers. This cassette spacing cribsheet details the spacing for 8-speed Shimano cassettes, which should be the same for both Deore and Acera. Edit: I should also mention that a cassette with a large maximum sprocket could be incompatible with some derailleurs, but this Acera cassette has a maximum sprocket size that is typical for a mountain bike. 

This may depend on whether you have ST-4400 or ST-4500 brifters (both are Tiagra). According to one ST-4500 manual (SI-0033A), you should be able to trim in both directions with a triple front derailleur. However, according to the ST-4400 manual (SI-6CT0C) and the other ST-4500 manual (SI-6LP0A), trimming with the smaller lever is only available with double front derailleurs. For indexing brifters in general, only being able to trim in one direction is common. With double chainrings, this usually isn't a problem, but with triple chainrings, trimming is more important. Unfortunately, there's not really anything you can do if your shifter wasn't designed to allow trimming in both directions. 

If you've touched each field and remaining route distance is not an option, then I think it's safe to say that including this information on the dashboard is not possible. That said, the compass mode and possibly the navigation mode seem to be able to include this information, though they may leave off other data that you care about. 

However, switching from a triple crankset to a double crankset will be a problem unless you also replace the front shifter with one that is designed to work with a double front derailleur. Edit: It looks like the Tiagra ST-4400 and ST-4500 are actually compatible with both double and triple front derailleurs: 

The purpose of the channel in a bike saddle is to reduce pressure to the perineum, which can cause numbness and other long-term problems. This is a matter of both comfort and health, although not everyone is affected. Individual body type, saddle design, bike fit, and riding style work together to make saddle fit a very personal issue. On a related note, some of the worries about erectile disfunction seem to be overstated, though this is still an open area of research. See: Saddle Seats and Erectile Dysfunction - The myth Exploded. 

It looks like I'll need some sort of special tool for the ring with the three notches. What tool will I need for adjusting this headset? 

In general, parts should be compatible between Tiagra, 105, and Ultegra. As you mentioned, the 10-speed rear derailleur should work with 9-speed shifters: 

It would be nice to be able to estimate the grade of a road while riding, even if the estimate is not completely accurate. With a GPS, in theory it should be possible in theory to ride a short distance and divide the difference in elevation by the distance ridden to get a rough estimate. (Note that the sine and tangent are comparable for small angles.) Is the elevation given by a cell phone or GPS-equipped bike computer accurate enough to give a meaningful grade estimate over short distances? Furthermore, is there any practical way to estimate the grade of a road that does not require a GPS? 

I have not yet built a wheel (or even replaced a broken spoke), so it's not quite clear to me what a nipple driver is. I also didn't find any reference on Sheldon Brown's Wheelbuilding page. What is a nipple driver and how is it used? Is it a necessity or a convenience? Would I use one when replacing a broken spoke? 

There are plenty of bikes available with a single chainring. However, only certain types of bicycles come with single chainrings. People generally buy according to their needs, and products are generally offered in accordance with demand. The two main categories of bikes that often come with a single chainring are comfort/city bikes and track/single-speed bikes. Comfort bikes such as beach cruisers often have coaster brakes, chain guards, and other features to minimize the amount of maintenance required. Track bikes were originally designed for racing at velodromes, but they have developed a broader appeal due to trendiness and low maintenance requirements. On the other hand, road bikes and mountain bikes generally have a wide range of gears to allow a wide range of speeds. If they came with only a single chainring, they would not meet the needs of most cyclists, so they wouldn't be bought. In short, there are plenty of bicycles with single chainrings, and they tend to be bikes that are designed to be low maintenance. Bikes designed for performance usually come with a wide range of gears.
