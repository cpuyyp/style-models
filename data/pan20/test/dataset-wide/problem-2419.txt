Yes there are difficulty levels in that. In one occassion Buddha him self said that if any one can give up greed he is one step behind the Nirvana. Most of the steps in buddhism is about greed your right without the right vision we can't see greed. Pain is a form of greed. We try to satisfy our selves with many thing may be massage or sex what ever thing is a form of greed. If you think that this body we have can we do what ever we like with it. Can we stop growing old or stop growing nails. Yeah we can't so this don't belong to us. So we have to see this is as a pain or a greed. We apply many things eat what ever we like this all is greed. The english term greed doesn't give the whole meaning out here. Falling in love with family, wife this is also going under greed. If there is no greed or a task there is no reason for you to exist. If you wish your beloved wife or mom in next birth there you have a reason to exist. So the exact term for this is A CONNECTION. We have to break all connections. In Hinduism or Yoga there is something called Kundalini in there to complete all levels we have to open a chakra in middle of the head. So the step to do that is to remove all you love from mind. After you do that there is no concern for anything anymore. If you get psychic powers from the Kundalini you don't have a reason to use it. You don;t like showing off and you don't want any connection in the 1st place. So you will stay calm. 

Buddha said that there is a specific way to teach the dhamma. That for example, if I remember correctly, among other things, it's important to mention the cause and effect in one's teaching. I can't find this anywhere, can someone give me a source for this? Also, what if I teach the dhamma in a wrong way? Is this causing demerit/bad merit/bad karma? What if I mean to teach it in a right way, but it comes out wrong or even causes the listener to have a strong aversion to buddhism/listening to the dhamma? 

The more insight one gains by meditation and studying the suttas, does one also gain a higher proficiency in teaching the dhamma? To put up an extreme example, if someone attains nirvana/full enlightenment, is he as proficient/competent in teaching the dhamma as the Buddha himself was? I read that there can be Buddhas, which attain enlightenment by themselves, but neither have the fellowship nor the necessary skill to teach the dhamma, is this true? 

Yes it certainly got some similarities. Yeah buddhism originated in India and there were 27 buddhas before the Gauthama Buddha so there are some techniques remianed from others. But it certainly is the same. In Pranayama there is a rhythm of exhale and inhale. But in Anapansathi. Which is "Ana-(inhale)-pana-(exhale)-sathi(concentration)" This just keep concentrating on the Exhale and inhale in a little while you feel calmness you never felt before and slowing things down. This is the last meditation technique Buddha has done before the Enlightnement. There are 4 other meditation techniques to support like Mithree Meditation where we bless ourselves and all animals and everything we can see and cannots including our enimies. This all comes under Samatha Meditation. So if you want to goto Anapanasathi which is under Vipassana Mediation. You have to follow the Samatha meditation to get a relief for body and mind. I guess you get the answer. 

Does anyone know the significance of The Treatise on the Ten Doubts in Pure Land? I cannot find much online. 

The Nyanaponika Thera translation is a bit more condensed here and uses "fettered" instead of "joined" 

3149 retweets -- so that's probably where I saw it. As for adding environment to body, that's probably my interpolation, since the material circumstances of one's present life are clearly karmic, according to Buddhadharma. It's probably impossible to trace this to a single origin, however, as it seems to be all over the place in various versions, including from sources other than Buddhists. 

So, my question -- can folks point me to similar material in the Pali Canon, Visuddhimagga or other non-Tibetan sources. Likewise in Tibetan lineages other than Gelug. 

In the Vanijja Sutta Buddha talks about the four requisites for trade. I couldn't find the four anywhere, does anybody know what he refers to? 

Somewhere on this site I read in an answer that certain traits you develop or inherit are responsible for your physical appearance. Now of course good deeds in one life will lead to positively perceived things in the next life (wealth, health, noble birth etc.), however my question is this: Can one deduce ones physical appearance from traits in a previous lifetime? Again, of course, there are many factors coming together, but I think there could also be a general trend in this. What I read here for example was that if you are a calm, patient and kind person and/or practiced and developed patience and kindness, you would be reborn as a person that other people perceive as attractive. I'm aware of karma and if you are generous, you lay the ground for other people being generous to you at some point in a certain way, but I'm interested in certain traits manifesting in your physical appearance, or influencing your behaviour/demeanor/impression on other people. 

The Third Truth indeed says that desire/craving/taṇhā/thirst can be eliminated. But it doesn't say how! It's not easy -- desire is tenacious, self-perpetuating, deeply embedded in our psyche. That's because it is inherently a matter of attraction -- satisfying desire feels good, and we want therefore to repeat it. And every time we do repeat it, it gets stronger. So eliminating desire is not easy -- you can't just wish it away. Anybody who has tried to lose weight or quit smoking knows that well. And eliminating all desire is a lot harder. In general, because you can name and describe a goal does not mean you can "just do it". On the stock market, the old saying is that the trick is "buy low, sell high". Sounds simple. But how to do that consistently fills whole bookshelves, heck, whole libraries. So getting back to the Four Truths -- how to eliminate desire is the Fourth Truth. 

a few months ago I looked up one of the questions, and there was a link to a specific letter exchange. However, no matter where I look here or on search engines, I can't find it. If I'm not mistaken, it was between a female student and a Zen teacher/master. The student was terminally ill, but managed to attain higher forms of consciousness/enlightenment. Shortly after she attained enlightenment, she felt that she was dying and informed the Zen teacher of this, who then came in the last few days of her life to pay a visit. The Zen teacher then published this letter exchange, where he also made notes on the letters, explaining how she developed further and further. Does anyone know about this and can post a link?
