I think it's instructive to consider what things can change and what things can't as a bike is sized up or down. Obviously, the tubes can be made longer or shorter. Stems can be made with more or less "reach". But wheels only come in discrete sizes, and there generally are not fine variations in size for cranks, handlebars, brake levers, etc. There are limited possible variations in BB width, eg, so cranks are apt to be too far apart for someone who's 5-2 and too close together for someone who's 6-8. (Not that it matters that much, since the person who's 5-2 can't operate the brake levers anyway.) 

So any idea where to find an appropriate hanger and derailer (or at least a clue as to what is "appropriate")? 

Eyeglasses, particularly those with relatively "low profile" lenses, will cause problems in an extreme aero crouch position. So it depends on the specifics of your glasses, the bike, and your usual riding position. I'm extremely nearsighted and wear glasses that are about midway on the round/low-profile axis. I ride a touring bike (ie, a road frame) with a relatively high drop bar. On the hoods I have little trouble with my glasses. On the drops (which I rarely use) I have to tilt my head up a fair amount to see through the lenses, but can when needed. (I can generally see adequately to steer when peeking over the tops of my glasses.) My bigger problem is seeing through the glasses AND my helmet mirror at the same time. Requires careful positioning of my mirror and some twisting of the head to see behind adequately while on the hoods, and it's a lost cause while on the drops. I find that using a "Croakie" eyeglass strap helps a lot by keeping my glasses from sliding down my nose. 

OK, this is a rhetorical question that deserves to be closed as "opinion based", but gotta ask. Why do we need to have "27.5 inch" bikes? If you dig through the specs (they don't come right out and say), this is a 650B rim, which Sheldon quotes as being for "French utility bikes, tandems, and loaded-touring bikes; some older Raleigh and Schwinn mountain bikes", and which is otherwise known as 26 x 1-1/2". 

Definitely do something to protect the back of the neck, and your ears (even with a helmet). The other area that it seems often "surprises" you is the backs of your lower legs (though this may be peculiar to the higher latitudes I frequent). You of course need a sleeved jersey or sun lotion on your arms, and either knee-length pants or sun lotion on the tops of your thighs. [I'll add that I've several times been on tours with a guy who has "sun allergy", and he does remarkably well in a full-length Tyvek suit. On hot days when you'd expect him to suffocate, he churns merrily along.] 

There are wash additives sold to hunters (and available at "outdoor" shops such as Gander Mountain) that do a good job of removing odors -- they're specially designed to get out the fatty acids that contribute to "sweat smell" (and which hunted animals can supposedly sense). 

The bike doesn't matter that much, except when there's snow or ice on the roads. What you need most is the right clothing. It needs to be well-adapted to cycling (not loose or apt to get caught in the chain), layered so you can take off pieces BEFORE you get too warm, with wind-resistant and rain-resistant layers. Your shoes need to be somehow protected from wet spray, with rubber booties or such. Wet feet can get VERY cold. Lots of opinions on gloves -- you should probably have several pair, from warm "ski gloves" for really cold days to lighter-weight gloves for most days. "Glove liners" are a good idea -- you can use them alone (under regular cycling gloves) on warmer days, and they come in handy when you need to work on the bike in cold weather since you can work reasonably well with them on. For the bike, any bike will work for plain rain or cold (though fenders are nice in the rain). For riding in actual snow (where the roads have not been cleared) you want a substantial tread, and possibly lugged "mountain" tires. For any sort of ice you MUST have studded tires -- riding on ice without studded tires is suicide. I don't feel that commuting is apt to "ruin" a bike, but you probably wouldn't want to subject a $6000 bike to the bad weather, road salt, being parked outside at the other end, etc. And if you do want to ride in the snow and don't already have a bike suited to knobby tires, it does make sense to purchase a modest "mountain" bike. Added: Forgot to mention the head. I always wear a helmet, making a bulky hat impractical. At one time I had a "helmet liner" (probably purchased from Performance or Nashbar) that was a sort of diamond-shaped piece of blue polypro fabric with loops to fit the helmet straps. This worked well -- kept the ears warm in fairly cold weather, which is the main challenge -- but I lost it and never found a replacement. I've tried several balaclavas and face masks but never found one that would fit comfortably, without either obscuring vision or interfering with breathing. 

For cycling across China you want a reliable bike that is unlikely to give you trouble, and which can be repaired with "local" resources if it does. Forget about "lighter" wheels -- you want reliable wheels, and a pound less weight (if that) from a lighter wheel will not make any difference. And I'd stay away from a geared hub, unless you can find one that you know is popular in China. You do need a comfortable bar, but that's a personal thing and quite relative. You should take at least two spare tubes, maybe a spare tire (see Sheldon Brown for how to fold it), patch kit(s), boots, and a good frame pump (don't rely on a "compact" model, and remember that you may have 20 flats, so going with CO2 alone is risky). You should have some extra chain links and a chain tool (and make a crib sheet on how to use it), and maybe 2-4 "master links" of your favorite brand. A few carefully chosen tools -- wrenches to fit seat bolt, crank arms, wheel axles (if not QR), etc. And several spare spokes -- you generally need 3 sizes -- at least 2 of each. Also, it's good to have the minimum tools needed to remove the cluster, in case you need to replace a spoke on that side. (Assume that you can borrow, eg, a pipe wrench or some such to operate a cluster wrench.) And don't forget the spoke wrench -- get a good quality one, not the one-size-fits-all ring thing. Sun lotion, bug lotion, at least some "emergency" food, and a "road rash" first aid kit. (Cortisone cream for bug bites is also often very handy, though toothpaste will work in a pinch.) And whatever camping gear and clothing you need, based on how you will be traveling. And, of course, maps, money (stashed several different places), lock for the bike (with extra cables to secure panniers), etc. You might want to bring along some sort of trinkets to give to the locals as you meet them. Simply some shiny new quarters would likely do, or you may have some other idea. 

Of these possibilities, #2 is the worst, as riding with your crank arms loose very quickly damages the arms to where they will no longer fit tightly. 

Well, not to encourage spammers, but the Totem Pole is an interesting design. It does have the advantage that the weight is carried fairly close to the vehicle, so there's less torsion on the hitch -- maybe this isn't sufficient to really allow the weight of 6 bikes to be carried, but it likely handles 4 better than the standard horizontal beam rack. I would be a bit concerned about carrying the bike's weight solely from the front wheel, as this design does. At the very least you'd want your bikes to have "lawyer lips", and on a long ride I'd be concerned about stressing/distorting the wheel. Plus it's not clear (despite the cavalier statements to the contrary) that bikes wouldn't bump/rub each other while being jostled on a rough road. Also, the rack probably has trouble with kids bikes, since the wheels will not hit the bottom bar. 

Since the original comment is attached to a deleted post I'll repeat it here: There are special odor-killing laundry agents that can be quite effective against certain odors. One I've used is Scent Killer, a laundry additive intended for use by hunters to remove the odor from their clothing (so they don't spook their prey). Hydrogen peroxide can also be used for this (though it has a slight tendency to bleach colors). The same agents can be useful for washing out smelly bike shorts.
