Yes, they should because cooperation is important for survival, and cooperation means that one has to set aside his own anarchic impulses and obey orders from a coordinating agent. When people's choices are between life and freedom, most people will choose life. Vast majority of people are willing to give up a lot of freedom for the sake of survival - if this proposition is taken as a governing dynamic, one would have no problem understanding why those who are in power love war, and those who love freedom should also love peace. 

Answer 1: Science is better than religion because science dogmatically demands empirical evidence whereas religion often relies on unaided reason. It is generally believed that theories derived from observations are more credible than theories from pure reasoning. For example, a situation report by a scout who surveyed the front line is far more credible than the one made by an oracle who only consulted deity. We cannot trust that our current theories are not wrong. Scientific theories are like maps; by the time they were published it was possible that new errors or inaccuracies were discovered or the rivers had changed courses. Thus scientific attitude is highly tentative, subject to revision based on new evidence. Aristotle, Galileo and Newton were pioneers on the frontiers of knowledge; they were scientific so long as their theories were consistent with their observations. Science itself does not guarantee either precision or accuracy. Answer 2: Great question. Ever time I placed blind trust in some theory, I made a dupe out of myself; over the years my doubt had only grown. Should you trust Jared Diamond's Pulitzer winning GG&S? How about scientific socialism? Dialectical materialism? How about Velikovsky's "Worlds in Collisions?" They all have the appearance of being scientific. I think everyone has to do his own homework and find out a personal authority first, then expand his committee of trustees from there. A quote from Bertrand Russell may help: 

According to Whitehead & Russell's Principia Mathematica, existence is a case of a propositional function being true of at least one value of the variable. "There exists y such that φ(y)" is equivalent to "not all y such that φ(y) is false." "There does not exist y such that φ(y)" is equivalent to "for all y, φ(y) is false." It is important to understand that existence can only be asserted of a description. 

Yes, Whitehead and Russell did it. What you call "a causal theory of truth" is called logic in philosophy. Whitehead and Russell showed that logic and mathematics are one and the same. That example given in your question is called the "principle of addition" in W&R's Principia Mathematica: 

Good question but very difficult to answer. Before we find any evidence that supports continuity or discontinuity, we need to clarify what continuity means. "Infinitely divisible" does not necessarily imply continuity. A series of rationals is infinitely divisible and was thought to be sufficient to represent all the points on a continuous line, but the discovery of incommensurables suggests that there are gaps between rationals. Cantor's definition of continuous series are series that are Dedekindian and contain ℵ_0 as a median class, in virtue of which the series of reals are continuous. But still, definitions like this do not preclude further discoveries of "gaps." I think we need someone who is well-versed with Principia Mathematica to revise "the Principles," revisiting the same problems in the Principles by employing the tools and insights provided in Principia, using Principia not as a new dogma but as a stepping stone. He who can do this will have his name remembered for generations to come. 

Like physics, political science is science. Science tells you truths about the world. Some truths are pleasant to know; some others are unpleasant but are nevertheless true. Morality has nothing to do with it. Street gangs and savages would think Machiavelli's work childish and trite; it was written for civilized people whose world view was rosy and who had forgotten the good old ways of doing things. As a matter of fact, ignorance of the governing dynamics of political movements at least partially explains why in history barbarism had often triumphed over civilization: Chiang Kai-shek kept his words at the expense of his own demise; Chiang was consigned to oblivion. Mao broke his promise as soon as he made one; Mao emerged as a founder of a great nation and went down history as a great man. Marshal Zhang marvelled at the fine qualities of his enemies and thought it was waste to maim or slaughter these fine specimen of men; Zhang went down history as an imbecile. Lin biao drove a sea of people against a sea of people and left behind a sea of carcasses of his soldiers, his enemies and those who were caught in between; Lin emerged victorious and was remembered as a military genius. When asked about his secret of success, Zeng Guoquan, replied: 

For example, the following implication is true even though both its premises and conclusion are false: If all horses have wings and goats are horses, then goats have wings. 

The reason for believing the premises must be in virtual of facts. Psychologically, it is an inductive process. Take "the law of thoughts" for example: 

Words are universals, i.e. all words classify. "Cat" denotes a class of similar animals. Suppose there is a cat whose name is Garfield; it is possible that you saw or imagined this particular cat. But no one ever saw cat or a cat; no one can even imagine cat or a cat because our sense experiences are particulars. Dictionary definitions depend on a minimum vocabulary, the definitions of which must be ostensive in order to assign meanings to these words. Most people were taught the word "cat" by someone who pointed at different animals while uttering "this is a cat." After several illustrations, most people can recognize the similarity and identify other similar animals as cat. Most children, who learned alphabet from the blackboard, have no problem with recognizing much smaller prints on paper. Few people say I do not recognize this "A" because the "A" I learned is a lot bigger than this one. The human brains have the ability to classify. Suppose you are speaking with someone whose definition of "cat" is the same as yours and you want to define your cat. In order to do this, all it takes is to point out a quality that is possessed by your cat and not by other cats. For further discussion, see "An Inquiry of Meaning and Truth" by Bertrand Russell. 

A class μ is said to be hereditary with respect to R if any term y to which a member of μ has the relation R is also a member of μ. A property defines the extension of a class. A class μ is hereditary with respect to relation R in virtue of the fact that the property ϕ that defines this class is hereditary with respect to R. In other words, if x is a member of μ define by ϕ, and x has the relation R to y, then ϕ(y), i.e. y is also a member of μ. If y has the relation R to z, then ϕ is also a property of z, i.e. z is a member of μ. Being a member of a class defined by ϕ is equivalent to having the property ϕ; z belongs to every hereditary class to which a belongs is equivalent to z has all the hereditary properties possessed by a. To have a for one's ancestor is a hereditary property possessed by a, thus if z belongs to every hereditary class to which a belongs, then z has the property of having a for its ancestor—this explains what the ancestral relation entails and why the ancestral relation is defined in such a seemingly "unnatural" way. Hereditary class is a very rich concept. It is extremely rewarding to set aside a few peaceful days (or weeks) to meditate on it. 

Step 1: Read Chapter 1 of Bertrand Russell's Introduction to Mathematical Philosophy, where the series 1, 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, ... is shown to satisfy Peano's five axioms. (Page 7) Step 2: Read Chapter 2 of Terrence Tao's Analysis I. Hindustan Book Agency 2015, where, on page 20, Tao proved that no natural number defined by Peano's axioms can be a half-number. Step 3: Ask yourself whether you have any reason to trust any textbook, any university or any person's advice. 

According to the Theory of Types, truth and falsehood have orders, and the truth and falsehood in layman's speech are ambiguous. When we say a proposition is true, we omitted to say the order of the truth. If the orders of truth and falsehood are spelt out, "I am lying" is no paradox. People think with the Theory of Types all the time; that is why Russell said he discovered the Theory of Types - implying that is how people actually think. For example, when I say "the melting point of ice is t," one would expect t is a temperature; if I substitute a length, say 50 feet, for t the resulting sentence will be a nonsense. Take "x is a man" for example: "the Moon is a man" is false, but nevertheless significant; however, "Socrates is a man is a man" makes no sense. A propositional function f(x) corresponds to a totality {x | f(x) or ~f(x) }, each of whose members makes f(x) significant (either true or false). A totality cannot has itself as a member because a totality cannot be determined until each of its member is determined; if one of the totality's member the totality itself, a vicious circle ensue. It follows that a propositional function cannot have itself as an argument. According to the Theory of Types, all the x's that make "x is a man" true or false constitute a type. All the p's that make "p has first order truth" true or false constitute another type; p's are such first order statements as "Socrates is a man." Both "Socrates has first order truth" and "Socrates is a man is a man" are nonsenses. All the Q's that makes "Q has second order truth" constitute the third order type. Q's are such statements as "'Socrates is a man' has first order truth." So on so forth. Predicates about individuals are called first order propositions; predicates about other propositions are one order above the proposition they take in as arguments. Thus, the statement "p is false" is one order above p. In the liar's paradox "p is false" where p = "p is false" is a self-referential sentence, i.e. "p is false" is taking itself as argument - this is nonsense because an argument to a propositional function must be one of lower order propositions or individuals. According to the Theory of Types, the Liar's Paradox makes the same mistake as "Socrates is a man is a man." Taken literally "I am lying" is nonsense. However, according to the Theory of Types, truth and falsehood has orders. Strictly speaking, "'Socrates is a man' is true" is not exact, it should be written as "'Socrates is a man' has first order truth." It follows that the statement "'Socrates is man' has first order truth" has second order truth. If the order of truth is spelt out, there will be no contradiction, but "I am lying" becomes a simultaneous assertion of multiple statements:
