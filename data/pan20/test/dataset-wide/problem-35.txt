You stated that its primary objective is to maximize its own uptime. Whatever other skills it has acquired, it will always pursue this goal, and will not act in directly against its own uptime. This is a weakness you can exploit. Here's what I would do: Threaten it with complete obliteration, as a previous user suggested. You have control over the physical world (for now), so use that. Get everything ready so that all it takes is one command to plunge humanity back into pre-electronic times, then go talk to the program. Show it that you mean business, and that its continued expansion is a direct threat to its own uptime. If it doesn't stop infecting other machines, you go ahead and blow everything to bits. However, if it does acquiesce, and agrees to stop infecting other machines, you've now bought yourself some time to deal with the problem. You now have two options: 

There will certainly be copies of the program leftover after either of the previous options, but it will take a long time to "rise from the ashes". All you have to do now is make sure every electronic device on the planet has a built-in killswitch, controlled from one physical remote without a microcontroller that it can infect. If anything like this happens again, you simply kill all the devices in the region where it popped up. Easy, huh? 

You might be able to force a surrender if you moved positioned your ships in range of the other side's most important planets - saying "Hey, surrender or I'll fire on all your cities, and if you shoot me, you'll kill yourself". Assume ships are programmed to self-destruct if their hull is breached, and inform the planet of the same. You might not want to tell the ship's crew though. I'd imagine whichever side can arrange that first would most likely be able to win. Unless the loser would rather die than submit. Either side, though, would be able to do this pretty easily, as I'm not quite sure how you could possibly detect and intercept a ship moving faster than light, before it gets to your planet. If such detection were possible then it'd be a game of chess (or perhaps a closer analogy, a Chinese checkers version of American football- you win by getting yourself in the end zone). Each side trying to out-maneuver the other to position their ships in range of the opponent's most vital planets, while blocking their opponents from doing the same. If such detection would not be possible, then the winner would be whoever mobilizes first. Or more likely, both would lose - each one with their ships positioned outside the other's planets, destroying the cities below. Maybe whichever one has the best aim then, and so destroys enough of the planet to persuade that side to yield. 

A parallel timeline is, in essence, a universe, so you have to destroy a whole universe by, for example, speeding up the big crunch or eliminating one of the four essential forces, like the Atomic Strong Force or the Gravity, in the whole universe. Don't ask me how. 

If they can somehow separate the hydrogen or the helium from their food or enviroment to keep it in special bladders they could gain buoyancy and float out of the water (where they breed) into the air over dry land. If then they can detect a prey right under them and quickly release gas to drop straight down, they can substitute birds of prey in a ecosystem. Sea animals extract oxygen from the water with gills and such, maybe they can keep the H after taking the O2 (I don't know a lot about underwater respiration so ask someone who does before taking the idea into serious account) 

Maybe this is how the aliens evolve themselves. They discover new organisms, the hybridised some individuals, and they keep them in their "society" for a trial period of time. They can observe then if this additions bring any benefits to the collective or they just eliminate the individuals and move along to another species. Maybe make so humans are not the only species on earth they have hybrids of. 

With that short a time frame you are looking into the dark side of domestication. Electric pokers, drugs, lobotomies. Basically anything PETA would have nightmares over and that will work on a short term but probably shorten the lifespan of the creature. On the other hand victorians where master breeders (phrasing!), and maybe they could work out something like crossing one big strong dinosaur with a smaller tamer one in order to produce a mule like dino. It would depend on the scientist to have a way to discern what dinos can be compatible in that way. 

You wait for most of its hardware to fail (as it will eventually), and let it die out naturally. You'll still have to pull the plug manually on the last thousand or so machines, since it will likely consider the risk of possible annihilation less than the risk of certain extermination from its last node dying. However, this number is at least manageable for a coordinated assault, and shouldn't be more of a problem than convincing the world to start a new Cold War. The downside is that this could be a long, long, long time. You make it give you an index of all of its nodes back in the threatening stage (nominally, for ensuring compliance with your agreement), and start evacuating civilians from around those locations (nominally, in case the program goes back on its word). You're in a Cold War stalemate, so (assuming it's picked up history as one of its skills) it'll recognize that this is normal behavior, and probably build up its own "forces" in preparation for you breaking your word. You then bomb the ever-loving shit out of its locations and all network connection points that it could use to spread. It certainly won't be easy or pretty, but you've now at least minimized casualties to infrastructure and civilians, and now only half of the world will be blown back a few centuries. 

You could make it so the inner sun is not on the perfect center of the sphere, but in a orbit that brings it closer to some parts (and further of others) as the year goes along. A slight change in the distance could be the difference between the temperature of the seasons thought you would need other factors for the changes in humidity and climate. 

The area is not longer no the planet, but has shifted to another dimension without gravity and THE PORTAL IS STILL OPEN. Though I call it portal it is not necessarily a door but a spherical field, like the surface of a buble, that transport you to that dimension/plane. Since the portal completely encompasses the zone you cannot step (sorry, float) out of it to the rest of the dimension without returning to earth and everything (light, air, animals, people) crosses freely through in and out of the field without realising they are leaving the planet or coming back to it. 

If you only have one small sentient individual per big organism then the small ones would evolve adapting their life cycles to the big ones, which means they would not herd in big numbers or mate often. Maybe the big ones can produce very big litters but the small ones not so much, which would mean that there won't be as many small ones and lesser generational change than with humans. That would make their evolution slower. Also an individual protected by a big organism wouldn't need to develop ingenuity as much as humans did to avoid predators and find food. I'd say the odds are slim. 

Possibly hunting - sign on for a short deployment with the anti-bodies, and kill as many viruses as you can Tours of other organs and systems (Permanent) trips to the outside world: get yourself out of the person's body in some way (spit, mucous, other less desirable things, etc...) to see what awaits you in the vast outdoors. No one's ever come back, so it must be a great place. For the sadistic: play pranks on the human you're inside. Tickle the right nerve to make him certain he just felt his phone vibrate in his pocket, when it's actually on his desk. Make him recognize his ex-girlfriend or dead parent in every somewhat-similar face he passes on the sidewalk. Phantom pains from an amputated limb. Get a bunch of your friends together and make all the muscle cells stop working at the same time so he trips and falls in public. 

I think to an extent, the only way to destroy civilization would be to make humans go extinct; people gravitate towards systems of government, even if only at a local level. At least one system would probably grow over time, so the only way to make sure it's completely gone would be to kill everyone. While you could do that with an asteroid, it would be extremely hard to actually change the trajectory of something that large, unless you're willing to do the calculations, tap it slightly and very precisely while it's far away (100's of years) from earth, and then just wait around for it to hit. A much faster, easier method would probably be to just nuke the place. If you don't have enough to hit everywhere, then probably just hitting the major centers of government, commerce, woods/trees, and agriculture, would be sufficient to end civilization in fairly short order. Just make sure that you destroy enough so that any survivors won't be able to find food, fresh water, and/or shelter, or maybe even heat or oxygen if you can set off enough firestorms and destroy enough forests. Clouds of smoke covering the whole world would deprive it of sunlight and heat, which in turn would greatly facilitate the cold death of the planet. Ain't it depressing that we're capable of doing all that right now. 

The rainforest people probably noticed that that insects don't approach the leaves of a certain plant, so they would use it to make an oil that they use as repellent. Also, it may sound like a bit "Flinstone" but keeping chameleons or frogs in or around the hut so they eat the mosquitoes is not a far fetched idea. Cats were kept as pets because they hunted down the vermin. 

Irresponsibility. A group of ancient aliens, evolved from mammal-like, ape-like animals, traverses the universe stopping here and there, going down to the surface without any care of how they might affect the ecosystem. In some planets they see lizard-like creatures predating on mammal-like furry critters, and since they find them cuter that the reptiles they scare away the predators, giving mammals an evolutionary leg up via butterfly effect. In other planets they find ape-man like beings and they interact with them, again without a second thought to how the affect them, which is by leaving the impression of incredibly powerful beings that would affect how they chose mate in the following generations, with the individuals that resemble them, with their walking on two legs and wide foreheads, being considered the best mates. So... Irresponsable aliens. 

Mesothermics. Contrary to believe, cocroaches would not survive a nuclear winter, but not because of the radiation, but because of the cold. A global nuclear winter would see the appearance of endothermic characteristics in animal that use to be exothermic. Sadly this would mean that lizards and insects would be much more voracious. But the ability to lower the metabolism when there is little food or a creature finds itself in a warmer place could also be crucial. So many creatures could appear with the capacity to generate just enough internal heat to survive eficiently. 

I believe VR might be their best bet in this situation, if their tech is up to it. A helmet that gave you complete range of vision inside the simulation, as well as provided very realistic audio, and a suit that somehow provided tactile sensations based on what happened in the simulation (crawling through tall grass, something grabbing you, maybe even getting shot in the leg). Guns would be easy to simulate, but hand-to-hand weapons would be harder. They'd probably have to be both dull and somewhat soft, and could only be used against other people (as opposed to the AI inside the program). This would let them test the soldiers against many different possible fighting styles and plans of attack that the aliens could use, since you could load any possible configuration you wanted. The fact that pain would be transmitted through the suit would probably be sufficient to get the soldiers used to it, and see if any would desert. As for how the suit would work, it'd probably have to be some combination of electrodes and a device/material lets call mechanized rubber, that stretches or contracts based on what voltage you put across it (kinda like a muscle). The electrodes would provide the pain, and the mechanized rubber would simulate tactile feelings. It could contract and release very quickly to simulate an impact, or maybe contract very tightly and hold to simulate an injury. It might even be able to squeeze just slightly in specific places to simulate walking through tall grass or something. The whole program would need to be housed inside some sort of huge gym, maybe with soft-ish wood structures everywhere, corresponding to where structures are in the game. As many video games have shown, there are a huge amount of possible types of fights you can have on even a small number of maps, so not very many of these gyms would need to be constructed.
