The idea that our minds and bodies work according to some physical (as opposed to supernatural) laws is often sourced to de La Mettrie, though of course as with any major idea it's hard to give one source. The Wikipedia page on materialism lists thinkers going back as far as 600 BCE; the Cārvāka thinkers had ideas I think Anderson would find quite suitable, for example: 

I'm interested in sources discussing the obligations we have to be "beneficent", e.g. through charitable donations. Famine, Affluence and Morality is one of the more famous articles of this type. SEP has an overview as well. I am more interested in utilitarian-based reasoning, and things discussing what the "common man" can or should do, as opposed to things like medical ethics. 

Dissenters from this argument generally embrace the view that the question is misguided: ethical value doesn't come from having some set of capabilities, but rather arises through a shared contract etc. Carl Cohen defends this view, for example. Entire books have been written about this, if you are interested to continue researching it. On other fronts, you might be interested in the work that Varner, among others, has done to describe the likelihood that various species feel pain which can be roughly summarized as "vertebrates feel pain; insects possibly not so much". And Dan Dennett expresses some uncertainty as to what extent non-humans are conscious, but of course he is quite skeptical of most accounts of human consciousness as well.

Roundness can be given a definition, so let’s be explicit. If, for any object, there is a (sufficient*) set of points at that object’s edge which all (1) lie equidistant from one point within the object, and (2) lie alongside one another, then with respect to that one point within the object, it exhibits roundness. Now I first have to point out that the usual notion of judgment, while it would apply to the question of what counts as "sufficient*" in the definition of roundness, wouldn’t normally apply to any object which exhibits full sphericality like Sol does. It’s intrinsic to the definition that a perfect sphere exhibits roundness; by extension, it should be obvious that this applies to any elliptoid as well (as it must still be round in at least one plane). So most any object which obviously exhibits roundness in this manner does so via the definition of roundness. Perception alone is sufficient to tell us that the Sun is round with no judgement on our part. We would have to perceive a different object, or have a different definition for roundness, in order to be mistaken. Judgment traditionally allows that we can be mistaken, based on the facts we have available to us, not based upon the facts themselves. So the first issue here is captured by your first premise: we cannot confidently say that "predication is an integral part of making a judgment" insofar as your example goes. Can we find a better example, which supports this premise? Are there any counterexamples? Let’s leave answering these to the side, for a moment, and address this concept of universals you’ve constructed. The language you’ve chosen is a bit confusing, because in symbolic logic, which goes well beyond propositional logic, ’universals’ are an operator, denoted by an upside-down uppercase A. They work by applying some simple predicate (such as ’round’, ’blue’, or ’guilty’) to a variable. A symbolic logic sentence such as ∀x(Px) means Px is true for all x. To say that ’roundness’ is a universal would thus normally indicate that ’all things are round’, despite that this clearly goes against your intentions. Universals, (a.k.a. universal quantifiers) have their opposite number: the Existential operator, ∃. In contrast to the universal quantifier, a logic sentence ∃x(Px) means there is at least one x such that Px is true. Now this we can certainly say is true of ’roundness’ and the like. However, keep in mind that the way this works is because of the status of x as a variable, and the way that predicates are supposed to work. Predicates in logic are not facts, but descriptions; nor are they propositions in their own right. Variables are anything that can be described, but only if they are quantified universally. When quantified existentially, they are something which can be described. If all this seems a little fast, apologies. I’m attempting to summarize two semesters of university logic (which I’d recommend, by the way) into two paragraphs. It hopefully hasn’t yet distracted from the point, which is that the concept of predication as you’ve expressed it in your question, is crippled by these assumptions: (1) that facts can be predicates; (2) that predicates can be propositions; and finally (3) that judgement requires the qualities expressed by a proposition to exist. That is to say with respect to 1, you equate "x is a fact" with a proposition, because it fits the syntactic form of a proposition despite having no quality to express. A fact is simply a propositional statement, or predicate statement which is true. So "x is a fact" is only true if "x" is indeed a fact. There is nothing which makes this true, outside of the statement itself, and so it actually expresses nothing. As a predicate however, this may be slightly informative: let Fx be "x is true". Then it is certainly not the case that F is a universal predicate— some statements are false. So 2 is as well a false assumption. So back to the first point. Are there better examples than "roundness" or counterexamples? Try the proposition "unicorns are imaginary". If you take ’imaginary’ as predicative of unicorns, then it would be easier to apply this to judgment: given any example of a unicorn existing as it does in our imagination, the proposition would be false, making the truth of this statement subject to inductive judgment in the traditional sense. We judge that unicorns are imaginary because we have no facts available to contradict the claim, not because of the definition of the predicate. I certainly can’t think of any counterexamples. But perhaps this is because what you’re asking answers itself. The way you’ve laid out your concept of "universals" in your question, is (apparently) the same as predicates in the way I’ve tried to define them here— as descriptions which beg for quantification over some set of objects. Now, perhaps you mean something different than this. Yet this seems to be the only way to read you. So if I’ve understand you correctly, then the answer to your question is "yes". Predicates are descriptions, and fundamental to judgment is deciding whether some description applies to some object, event, concept, or person. In point of fact, that is all what judgment is. Were we to have no descriptions, then by definition we would be unable to form judgments. Or any thoughts at all, for that matter. 

A harder question to answer would revolve around defining 'truth'. We might suggest that to assert "X is true" means something like "it is useful for one to believe X". We could point to an increased sense of community among believers, for example, as evidence that belief in a divine being is useful and therefore true. This is a (poorly phrased version of a) tack that James took. 

I emphasize "morally relevant" since it is a question for biology to list the anatomical differences, which is of course an important thing to do, but off topic here. Phrased this way, this is the argument from marginal cases. Essentially, the claim is that so-called "marginal humans," such as those with severe cognitive handicaps, have mental capabilities similar (or inferior) to some non-humans. Quoth Singer (from Animal Liberation): 

There seems to be an equivocation between "rational" and "believes only in things which are 'true.'" This is not at all what "rational" means: 

Yes, of course. This idea is most famously discussed in Nick Bostrom's Are You Living in a Computer Simulation? Note that "Roko's Basilisk" is doing no real work for you here – you don't need any esoteric forms of decision theory to accept Bostrom's argument. 

I am going to focus solely on Bostrom's argument for the simulation hypothesis, as opposed to metaphysical skepticism in general. First, note that Bostrom himself doesn't find this overwhelmingly likely: 

At the end of the second section of On Liberty, Mill gives a summary of the four reasons why there should be free speech: 

I can't imagine that Ludwig would've accepted functionalist accounts of the mental well, but can anyone draw a direct line from quotes of his to any particular arguments against functionalism? 

This is a very good question, and not easy to answer. What intelligence purports to mean, seems to depend on what we're using the term for. The best purchase we can get on it without getting into a very long philosophical discussion is that "intelligence" as it's normally used refers to a broad collection of skills, some of which can be replicated by computers, some of which deals with vaguer concepts like common sense. Artificial Intelligence provides a good background for the use of the word. In this case it's taken to mean an ability to solve problems in logic, and much of the challenge in producing artificial forms of intelligence deals with constructing a method for automated handling of problems which aren't necessarily amenable to calculation. It seems clear that the feats of memory which computers can perform with ease, aren't what most people think of when they talk about intelligence. This is arguable, but let's take basic read-from-disk operations as our starting example; few people would argue that following a mechanically-built rule to retrieve the contents of a box at a given address constitutes anything like "intelligence" in the usual sense. What we intuit intelligence to mean gets muddier the more complex this process of recalling information is, but this should make the case that even if you want to reduce intelligence to "a set of many operations of varying complexity that perform memory retrieval at appropriate times", then intelligence will still refer to something like that whole set of rules of retrieval and information available. Yet how we can go on to distinguish "less intelligent" from "more intelligent still isn't altogether clear; efficiency of our rule set may help to set lower bounds, but the ability to solve general problems isn't yet possible by rules alone, and some people would argue, may never be. This reveals, I take it, that General Intelligence will normally be the target most philosophers will mean with the word 'intelligence': a general problem-solving ability that computation currently cannot deal with. Here we can go back to Gilbert Ryle (quoting from the Routledge Encyclopedia here- access is limited): 

Cody and Joe gave good answers, but I'd like to add that a common form of argument that you find in philosophy and not so much other places is a Syllogism. This is an argument of the form "P implies Q, P, therefore Q." As an example, a simple form of the argument from marginal cases goes like: 

There is a view known as "reductionism" which is often attributed to the Vienna Circle. The strictest form of the view (which is the one most attributable to the Vienna Circle) is that non-reductive statements are in some sense meaningless. From the paper you have linked though, I think you may be asking about a weaker form of reductionism: 

I found that Diamond and Koopmans have booth done some interesting work in this area. The blog post Kill the young people has a discussion of Diamond's paper, and Koopmans' "Stationary Ordinal Utility and Impatience" can be found here. Basically, they investigate the idea of "impatience" (valuing things which come earlier more) and show that under some reasonable conditions, population ethics must be impatient, a very counter-intuitive finding. It is often mentioned in the context of environmental ethics. 

Your specific question (about abortion) has been discussed a fair bit. In general, people seem to agree that when the mother's life is threatened it's OK: 

I think Phenomenology might be a good subject heading for "philosophy of the passions." Wikipedia's description: 

So, roughly, if you didn't exist and someone else did, it would be that other person marveling at the unlikelihood of their existence. Wikipedia has more. Nick Bostrom is the philosopher most strongly associated (in my mind) with these investigations. Some interesting consequences are the doomsday argument and the sleeping beauty problem. So roughly, I don't think the question you should ask is "how likely is it for me to exist?" but rather "how likely is it for someone like me to exist?" If you ask the former, I think the answer is, as you say, "miraculous". 

You've an interesting line of thought in that we could have "identity by degree", but it's a little misleading with respect to Parfit. In part III of his book Reasons and Persons he offers a series of thought experiments, mostly aimed at untangling Identity from Survival. He goes so far as to write that in the case of duplication, you survive as two people, but the further question of identity - "which you is you" - is an empty question, and meaningless. I take by your mention of "multiple-identity" you're familiar with all that, but it bears repeating. Part of the problem we have is equating subjectivity with identity, but that's wrong, and disastrously so. One subjective perspective isn't the same from one moment to the next in the same person, leaving us with either 

"Fallacy spotting" seems to be in vogue at the moment, but remember that accusing someone of committing a fallacy is just a way of saying that person has failed to provide a logically valid argument. Applying false premises to a validly formed argument is not fallacious, it simply means the argument is not sound, which is also to say that the argument fails. So to assert that another's argument is ridiculous and hence wrong with no further supporting evidence may be true or false, but as a single premise there is no further argument and cannot, by definition, be fallacious. 

"How objects are named" is something of a mystery to me. I imagine it's been a puzzle since Adam and his garden full of animals for naming. So to speak. For "how a same object can have different names referring to different aspects or features of an object", the most thorough treatment you'll find first is in Frege. If there are earlier mentions of this hydra, you'll find them there. 

With your edit I will venture a guess as to a more specific question, which hopefully is similar to what you want to know: 

Dennett talks about this as "Skyhooks" vs. "Cranes" A Crane is something which can build great complexity, but it rests on simple, fundamental principles. This is like evolution. A Skyhook (a crane hanging from a helicopter) is something which can build great complexity, but it rests on no firm foundations. This is like creationism. Some of the criticisms you bring up have been brought up by others who say that Dawkins doesn't differentiate well enough between these two in his Boeing 747 Gambit. He may not have presented the argument perfectly, but others have made it more rigorous. 

I think you really need to understand what "utilitarianism" means to Mill. The caricature of utilitarianism as "the greatest good for the greatest number" is good as far as pithy sayings go, but it leaves a lot of complexity out. You might consider Mill's famous claim: 

Nanotechnology and problems with super intelligence were the two most likely reasons the experts gave for human extinction in the next century. You might also believe that that humans will go extinct before becoming "post-human" simply because post-humanity isn't possible (e.g. it simply isn't possible to simulate a human mind on a computer chip). The second fork of the trilemma seems harder to argue for: perhaps people will view this as unethical, or perhaps simulations will be extremely expensive, but it seems harder to argue for this. 

That point of conversion from amoral agent to moral agent is not clearly defined, and may be intrinsically vague. You might start by asking, "does moral agency have clear existential borders, or can it exist as a matter of degree?" It's been pointed out before that we should not seek to do philosophy here on Philosophy.SE, so rather than engage in a conversation on the topic I'll just refer you to the sources on the subject. Jean Piaget is probably the best person to start with on the subject of childhood development and morality. If you can dig up any of his papers, many of them begin with this very topic. For a general review of childhood as a philosophical status, try the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy. 

To be perfectly honest, your question's a little offensive. I could equally well ask you: where can I find an exhaustive list of the different sciences that exist? How would such a question be reasonably answered? Not to mention that "schools of thought" are so varied that its unclear what you really mean by it. To be charitable, I'll assume that you're looking for the branches of philosophy, which is answerable. All that said, it's still useful to know what the broad strokes of philosophy are, and for that there's a recent, decent book by Simon Blackburn you could read through in few hours. In it, he teases out eight major branches of philosophy which cover most of the spectrum. I've rewritten his chapter titles to be more specific. Epistemology What do we know, and how can we know it? What is the nature of knowledge? What's the difference between true statements such as "3 + 2 = 5" and "The Statue of Liberty stands on Liberty Island"? Consciousness What is the phenomenon of being awake and aware? How is it different or similar to dreaming? What is pain? Is it possible to be certain that anyone else suffers the same phenomena I do? Freedom If the ability exists for all actions to be predicted, what does it mean to say that I am the agent responsible for my own actions? Is it meaningful at all, or just a hallucination? Identity Are you the same person you were yesterday? Will you be the same person fifty years from now? If I take some other object, and replace its parts one at a time, at what point does it ever cease to be the same object? Ontology Is there a Creator? If not, how did the the world (i.e., the universe) come to exist in the first place? Is causality a real relationship between events or just one we impose on the universe to make it sensible? Where do our beliefs about these things come from? Logic What is the difference between a good and a bad argument? What series of rules will always produce correct results? How can we describe the things we say or write in a way that allows them to be evaluated by these rules? What beliefs can we evaluate in this way? Perception Are the qualities of objects in the world produced by those objects, or are they imposed on those objects by our mind? By what means can we judge the things we see, hear, smell, etc., to be facts about the world and not imaginative hallucinations or clever illusions? Ethics Are beliefs sufficient to motivate certain actions? What are those qualities of an event, object, or person which makes it good?
