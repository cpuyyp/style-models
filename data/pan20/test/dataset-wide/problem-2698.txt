Physicalism is the idea that everything is matter. Idealism is the idea that everything is made up of a mental substance. Dualism claims that there are both matter and mind in the universe. It appears a large portion of philosophy seems to be content with those two substances, and those three views. Are there philosophies that call for a third (or fourth) substance which is not matter nor mind? (phrased differently, any philosophies which define mind and matter such that there is something else that is neither) 

This topic is monumentally too big, but given your comment about why you are asking it, I can at least give you one direction to look in. I have found Western philosophy to be dominated by dualism, the idea that there is a physical realm with natural rules, and consciousness as a separate "special" thing that most agree exists but few agree on what it is. 

I would say this is a case of an anecdotal fallacy. They found, through experience, that often nothing went wrong when they pulled the stick out. Thus they assumed that nothing ever goes wrong when they pull the stick out. Thus the loss of files must be an unrelated effect to be dealt with. This is a particularly interesting one because the solution to this fallacy is another fallacy. One may appeal to authority and say "When they say to need to click 'remove,' you actually need to click remove." This is particularly important because the reality of what the USB spec and OS specifications define is often way more complicated than what an individual wishes to deal with. 

This is an interesting definition. It's one that unravels in funny ways when you try to apply it. I mean, I can assign the word "boggmothafa" to anything I please and claim it's a thing, but what are its properties? What does it mean for reality to be a "universe and everything in it?" For example, one popular concept of "in it" is found in set theory. Nearly everything you've learned in both mathematics and science is founded in set theory -- meaning nearly every mathematical construct you use can be expressed in sets. They're a very natural concept which includes concepts of "including" its elements. However, when you then turn to the universe, you find that the universe is not a set. It's actually a class. So what if I start from the assumption that the universe is a class? Well, it turns out its quite a lot harder to build proofs around classes. You'll find many of the things you really really really want to be true in reality are actually not provable in class theory unless you limit yourself to sets. Also consider the Chinese Dao as an interesting counterexample. They might actually get away with claiming the Dao exists, because their approach doesn't pin the word to anything. Famously, "the dao which can be written is not the eternal dao." So in their sense, they handwave and say "there is a thing which exists and is everything," but they can't specify any properties thereof. They can only point in its direction. And you'll note in my word choice there, they assume the dao exists. It's an assumption akin to "I think therefore I am," but instead of being focused on "I" it's focused on something you're a part of. I think the only reason you can say it is proven that the universe exists if you are comfortable with the assumption thereof. However, always remember that a skeptic can sweep that assumption out from underneath your feet. 

One incredibly fundamental issue that arises with paradoxes is Tarski's undefinability theorem. It is a limit of formal languages. It states that any formal language meeting a particular criteria cannot define its own semantics. That criteria is rather broad: any formal language which can describe arithmetic and has the negation operator cannot define its own semantics! The "famous" paradoxes are typically ones which have received strict mathematical attention, so tend to be in comparatively formal form already. 

A physical compatibility must use very precise definitions of "freewill" and "morality" in their philosophy. The position is unforgiving for sloppy definitions. One challenge faced here is that "freewill" is often blindly assumed to mean "the ability of an agent to do whatever it wants." This has never been an effective model. For a test of why this fails so spectacularly, break into a bank after dark with no equipment or safe cracking training, and use your freewill to will yourself inside the safe. Clearly there are bounds to freewill. If nothing else, there are physical limitations. An example of a definition which can hold up to such complexities is one where you isolate a system. A bounding volume can suffice. There are physical properties on the surface of the bounding volume. One could define the freewill of that system to be the ability to create behaviors along this boundary which are not predictable using only measurements outside of the volume (in human terms: if the movement of my arms is not 100% predictable using measurements outside my body, then I can claim to have freewill). Obviously there are limits to this. You know that the probability of my arms growing 10 feet long is very low, but you should get the gist of it. As it turns out, with chaos theory, there are valid arguments that such a system can be unpredictable so long as the system is not driven into a stable state (a bullet to the brain pretty much ends freewill because we become predictable at that point, as we fall to the ground). As for morality, this is where I find physical compatibility so alluring. If one claims that there is a valid model for an agent with freewill (such as the chaotic box from the example above), then the claim is that it is valid to model the behaviors of the universe either using traditional definitions of freewill or a physically deterministic process. Thus concepts like morality are completely valid to a physical compatibilist because they start from the presumption that a physical construct can be created which meets our needs for defining freewill. Thus, any argument which hinges on freewill is valid to them, simply because they assert that a physical equivalent exists. As for the computer example, if the physical compatibalist declares it to have freewill, by whatever definition they find valid, they find that it is valid to model that computer as though it had a mind with freewill, and is thus bound by morality exactly so far as we are bound by it. 

Deductive reasoning is easy to argue for. Deductive reasoning is meaningless until you have a true statement about a group. Until you can confidently state "all swans are white," you cannot use deduction to make a statement about any one swan's color. I would argue that this can be used to argue for deduction in reverse. One should not accept the phrase "all swans are white" until one is willing to accept the deductive logic that comes from it. Inductive reasoning has been tricky, as mentioned in comments. Many do not actually consider it "obvious" and demand an argument for why we can engage in inductive reasoning. To me, the interesting one is abduction, which can be grossly paraphrased as "assuming the best hypothesis is true." It's what you use to go from "LIGO detectors have produced some really interesting squiggles which conform to that of gravity wave detection within a statistical error bound" to "LIGO has detected gravity waves." What's interesting to me is that that kind of reasoning is taken for granted with such a degree in today's scientific world that many have trouble even realizing that it was a logical reasoning step in the first place.
