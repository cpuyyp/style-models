As HDE pointed out, this isn't so. It's the earth's rotation being ahead of the moon's orbit that's caused the earth to slow down. The moon's tidal effect on the earth plays a role in that, but the Moon being tidally locked to the earth is irrelevant. Also, the earth's spin was much much faster than an 18 hour day when the moon was young. By this article, a day on earth was only a few hours long. $URL$ The earth, 4 billion years ago was spinning unusually fast for an object in our solar system. It might help to consider what makes planets spin. When they form, it's conservation of angular momentum, but according to the giant impact hypothesis, the earth was hit, not dead center but at an angle. The giant impact that formed the moon also set the earth spinning very fast. The moon was also very close when it formed - maybe just twice the Roche limit, so, that close, that the moon slowed the earth's spin and the (at the time) much larger tidal effects pulled on the moon, causing it to move farther away. 

I'm inclined to say no (and footnote, I realize Wikipedia isn't a good source for scientific proof as it's not always right, but I'm using it more to demonstrate a point than than use it as an authoritative definition). Wikipedia: 

In theory, there's no reason why a planet couldn't orbit close to the way you suggest. It's probably extremely rare, but theoretically possible. This gets a little tricky to explain, but an axis of rotation can be divided into perpendicular vectors. There's no real benefit to doing it that way but it can be done, just like direction and velocity can be separated into 3 vectors, rotation can too, and the combination of the perpendicular vectors gives you the rotation of the object and it's axis of rotation. That's discussed in a bit more detail here. If we use the Moon as an example. The Moon is oriented so it's heavier side permanently points towards the Earth. (the side of the Moon facing the Earth has a thinner crust and because crust is lighter than the mantle, the "Earth side" of the Moon has slightly greater density than the Far side. That greater density is more attracted to the Earth than the less dense far side and over time, the dense side of the Moon was oriented to permanently face the earth, similar to how the dense side of a floating objects orients itself downwards when floating in water. All planets, not being perfect spheres with perfectly layered density are unbalanced but the Moon is more lopsided than most. Mars more than the rest of the planets. Earth's uneven gravity has been measured in great detail, but in terms of effects on Earth's orbit and rotation, it's uneven gravity is pretty insignificant. Now some objects experience significant tidal deformation, like Io and Enceladus which are measurably squeezed by their elliptical orbits as they move closer to and further from their planets, but that's something else and you probably wouldn't want that on a planet as the volcanic effects would be too big. But what I'm talking about isn't a tidal bulge but a permanent imbalance of mass where one side of the Moon is denser than the other. So, if we figure the dense side of the Moon must always point to Earth due to tidal locking, that still leaves one way that the Moon can rotate without affecting the locking and that's along it's 90 degree longitude lines, and that, in theory could happen in addition to it's existing synchronous rotation that keeps the heavy side of the Moon pointed towards earth. This wouldn't be two axis of rotation, it would be one axis of rotation where the East-West vector of the rotation would still be tidally locked but the rotation around the 90 degree longitude line wouldn't interfere with the tidal locking, so the effect, the familiar face would spin around in a circle but always face the earth. We could in theory do that artificially if we put a big train on the moon and ran it 24/7 in the same direction around the 90 degree longitude line. Do that long enough and the moon would begin to spin. 

Is it possible? Not really. Not with your criteria. Could some mad scientists make it happen, like if we make the Moon bigger? Er, maybe. Types of eclipses. 

If the stars are all similar distance from us, like the Pleiades, then yes, you could find a place from where the stars would appear in a similar pattern and brightness, but the pattern would be a mirror image. You can't do it when the stars are significantly different distances because they wouldn't look the same. Most constellations are a range of distances, which wouldn't look like a mirror image from any distance. Take Canis Major for example. Sirius is the brightest star in the sky but in large part because it's only 8 light years away. The 2nd brightest star in that constellation, Epsilon Canis Majoris is about 430 light years away. At that distance, Sirius might not even be visible to the human eye. It certainly wouldn't be constellation worthy. 

Water can't exist in a vacuum. Water in space (atmosphere, no gravity) tends to form into a ball, but take away the atmosphere and it would rapidly fly apart. It actually wouldn't look like boiling. You get boiling on Earth because water is held in a pot by gravity. In empty space the water would rapidly and somewhat explosively disburse This article says it would look something like what happens when you throw hot water into very very cold air and it rapidly turns to snow. That's probably a pretty good visual image if you imagine no gravity and everything would just continue to fly apart, not slow by air resistance or fall to the earth. In cold space the water would freeze, but some of the liquid would also effectively also boil away, even in very cold temperature because liquid isn't stable in a vacuum. As I said, some of it would boil, but it wouldn't look like boiling, It would fly apart faster than it would freeze but you'd also see it freeze fairly rapidly. If the water was enclosed, freezing would take some time, but in a vacuum and spreading out, it would freeze into snow and ice crystals rapidly. A percentage of the water would become gas and that would help carry some heat away from the remaining water, speeding up the freezing process. That gas would fly away at high velocity and not be visible. If you collected and weighed the ice-crystals after the water was tossed into space you'd probably find that a percentage of the water escaped as gas. You can get an idea of water turning into ice by heat transfer and escape from forming into gas molecules in a video that show what happens to water in a vacuum chamber. A vacuum chamber can't replicate the rapid spreading out due zero gravity but it demonstrates the water turning to ice, even at room temperature. Here's one video of that. 

Your 3 points are spot on. There is a finite number of galaxies we could theoretically reach for the reasons you say. The further away the distant galaxy the greater the expansion of space between us and that galaxy and beyond a certain distance, galaxies can't be reached, even by the speed of light. We can see galaxies that we couldn't possibly travel to. 

Certainly "empty" space between galaxies has some things in it. Space has properties in and of itself, such as dark energy and virtual particles appearing in pairs and then disappearing, but ignoring the virtual and the not very well understood, empty space is full of photons, more specifically, Cosmic Background Radiation and all kinds of wavelengths of light from galaxies as well as cosmic rays and a boatload of neutrinos. Most of the matter that came out of the big bang was gravitationally drawn into galaxies, but likely not all of it, so there likely is some primordial matter between galaxies too, just not very much of it. (precisely how much is a bit over my pay grade). Also, as Conrad Turner points out, 3 or more body gravitational interactions can from time to time, kick a planet or star out of the galaxy but gaining sufficient velocity to escape the dark matter halo completely is probably quite rare, outside of galaxy on galaxy collisions, but rogue stars/planets outside of galaxies probably happens from time to time. 

You can see that the peak Northern Hemisphere summer solar radiation occurred around 11,000 years ago, but the temperature didn't peak until around 9,000 years ago. As I mentioned above, this is because the Earth is slow to respond to the somewhat small orbital variations and because glaciers take a long time to melt. The current level of peak glacial melt and peak sea level wasn't reached until a bit less than 8,000 years ago. 

Source of picture. That's basically how the Sun's soundwaves are studied. It's often compared to Sonar but I don't like that comparison because sonar works by sending a soundwave out and seeing what gets reflected back. It's more like the visual observation of sound vibrations, or, like studying a drum by looking at it's vibrations instead of listening to it. This is a picture of what those vibrations look like on the sun (again, greatly exaggerated). 

So, there were ten cardinals. Pope Urban was not one of the ten, though he was the driving force behind the trial. Source. 

There's too much to do here as each element could be written up separately, but one thing to consider, while complex elements like acetone or alcohol do appear to exist in giant gas clouds in space, and they likely exist in comets too, when a planet is formed, there's enormous heat in the process. Anything complex like that is likely to be destroyed in the planets formation. Also, photosynthesis, if that's going to be the basis for lush life, that creates Oxygen and Oxygen is very reactive, it would bind with any hydrogen and free Iron and likely free Sulfur and other elements and it would in time, react with and remove any CH4 from the air. If your "lush" planet doesn't operate on photosynthesis, then you can set up a different set of rules, but Oxygen is very reactive and certain other elements aren't possible once Oxygen becomes present in the atmosphere. Oxygen from photosynthesis would react with and remove any fairly large amounts of acetone or alcohol if it was present on a planet. Water is also very common in the universe, so, unless the planet is below freezing, or very high pressure, or very hot, it's hard to imagine oceans of anything other than water. On titan there are oceans of Methane, but that's cause it's really cold. Oceans of alcohol is a fun sounding idea, but I think, unlikely. 

Article here It went undetected until relatively recently because it's large enough that it no longer looks like a crater, but it is, and it affected the Moon's density where one half of the moon has a measurably thicker crust than the other half. (The crater half, I presume, the crust is thinner). This makes orbits around the Moon weird cause the moon is gravitationally quite lumpy. (Proximity to the Earth also makes orbits around the Moon weird, but that's another story. This ancient crater has a diameter of about 2,500 km compared to the radius of the moon of 1,737 km a ratio of about 144%, over twice the relative diameter and 4 times the relative size relative to the crater on Mimas. and Mars might have an even bigger one. See here. It's size isn't listed, but Mars (like the Moon) has a "split personality" where one side has a measurably thinner crust than the other side and one possible, perhaps likely cause of that is a giant impact. This "Crater" if we want to call it a crater covers about 1/2 the planet. This is different than the theorized Earth-Theia impact, which liquefied the surface and left no visible crater, but it may have liquefied half the surface and not left a very visible impact. One problem with measuring craters as they get this large is they look less like craters. 

There's no clearly defined definition of what a stable orbit is. Orbits can last for hundreds or thousands of years, millions, billions or even trillions of years. There's no neat and tidy definition between stable and unstable. Hubble for example, orbits the Earth every 97 minutes, and in a few years, primarily slowed by the very slight air resistance, it is expected to fall to the Earth. Many satellites, because their equipment doesn't last forever, are designed to gradually slow by air resistance and fall to the Earth after a few decades of operation. Satellites can be positioned where they stay in orbit much longer simply by moving them a bit further out, but there's little benefit to that. It's advantageous to have satellites fall to the Earth after they've served their usefulness. Orbits around the Moon are more unstable than orbits around the Earth for 2 reasons. One, because the Moon is gravitationally lumpy so low orbits around the Moon don't stay in place very long. See here. and two, because the Earth is gravitationally dominant, so the Moon doesn't have a very big hill sphere. Celestial mechanics doesn't like satellites to have satellites. See here and here. Our moon could have a satellite, but it likely wouldn't be stable for very long, at least, not long in a celestial time-scale. Trojan points, L4 and L5 are generally stable in a System where the larger body (Earth) is more than 25 times as massive as the smaller body (moon), but our Moon's orbit is too eccentric and too chaotic for lunar Trojan points to be stable for any period of time. Earth's L4 and L5 points around the sun are more stable and there are a few small asteroids in Earth's Trojan points. The Moon's L4 and L5 aren't stable cause the Moon wobbles too much in it's orbit. Eccentricity and perturbations tend to destabilize L4 and L5 points. That said, the Moon's L4 and L5 are more stable than L1, L2 and L3. Mars moon Phobos is in a decaying orbit that may only last 10 million years or so. Our Moon, however, even though it's slowly moving away from Earth, is sufficiently stable that it will outlast our sun. It's stable on the scale of many billions of years. As to your question "prolong an orbit via moon power", The moon tends to destabilize, not stabilize orbits around the Earth. But while L1 and L2 points aren't gravitationally stable, they are still useful places for satellites because they require less adjustment. Satalites with orbits that move around lagrange points are often used as useful locations. Take this bizar orbit around the Moon, where the NASA satellite transfers from L2 to L1 and could, in theory, be transferred back and forth without expending too much energy. This isn't a "stable" orbit by any means but it's an example of an unstable but useful orbit for the life of a satellite. 

A 24 hour day is 86,400 of those, well, more or less. A problem that early time-keepers ran into was that the length of the day varied based on the time of year. Earth does a complete rotation in about 23 hours, 56 minutes, so, the rotation really doesn't factor into it directly, but because Earth orbits the sun about 1 degree of arc every 24 hours, an apparent solar day is has been defined as 24 hours long for centuries. Days are shorter than that when the earth is closer to the sun, at perihelion, (by about 20 seconds) and days are longer than the 24 hour average by about 30 seconds at aphelion. Not enough for anyone to notice unless they were measuring solar time very precisely. So a day has to be averaged out, called a mean solar day, and that's what 24 hours was based on. The problem is, Earth's rotation is slowing down. The Moon is very gradually slowing down the rotation of the Earth by tidal interaction, so an average day is currently about 86,400.002 seconds. Leap seconds are added almost every year and in the future, leap seconds will be added more often. Officially a day is still 86,400 seconds, and when a leap-second is added, the "leap-day" is 86,401 seconds. But you could use either number for number of days in a year, average day (currently 86,400.002) or SI day* (86,400). As I understand it, a year is usually measured in 86,400 second days or SI days, not "average" days, but it's important to be specific about which one you're using. I've seen the occasional article that says that 200 million years ago a year was about 400 days long. That's clearly using average says, not SI days. And if you live in high altitude, your clock will run even faster and a day will run a tiny bit longer thanks to relativity but . . . lets not even go there for the calculations). A solar year, based on the position of the sun and the precise time of the solstice of your choice, which is a precise and momentary alignment. The length of a solar year changes a bit on a year-to-year basis. The position of the moon and gravitational perturbations from other planets, affect Earth's period of rotation a little bit, so like the day, the year should be averaged out also. Modern leap-year calendars adjust days to years quote well, but not to the accuracy you're asking about. Looking at the time of recent summer solstices (I've copied them down below for the June solstice). 6/21/2010 11:28 6/21/2011 17:16 6/20/2012 23:09 6/21/2013 5:04 6/21/2014 10:51 6/21/2015 16:38 6/20/2016 22:34 6/21/2017 4:24 6/21/2018 10:07 6/21/2019 15:54 6/20/2020 21:44 There's as much as 15 minutes variation in the length of a year over this 11 year sample. That's not because Earth's orbit is permanently changing. These are mostly fluctuations due to the Moon and nearby planets. An "average year", or mean tropical year, is currently about 365.2422 86,400 second days and if you want to get more accurate, 365.2421897 days on January 1, 2000. Formula in the link for adjusting to different years. I suspect, but I'm not 100% certain that the Earth's mean tropical year moves back and forth with some of Earth's Milankovich cycles. It's not slowing consistently in the sense that a day is slowing due to the Moon's gravity and inverse tidal force. According to Kepler's laws, the orbital period is based mostly on Earth's semi-major axis. The problem is that Kepler's laws aren't 100% accurate. Relativity is a factor when you try to pinpoint a year precisely to the second and variation in eccentricity, which affects Earth's orbital speed and the precise timing of an average year. What I know about orbital stability, is that Earth's semi-major axis changes very little, even during the Milankovich cycles, and orbital projections say, that it will probably change little even over time-frames of millions of years. The Sun is also losing mass, which should slow the Earth's orbit over time, but that effect is also very tiny. Over millions of years, it's thought that the length of a year doesn't change very much. The length of a day, over time-periods that long, changes quite a bit more rapidly. An unanticipated orbital change is always possible, but not thought to be likely. Orbits don't leave much in the way of track-able footprints, so they're hard to pinpoint over long periods of time and are mostly estimated by mathematical models so, take with a grain of salt, but models do suggest that a year is pretty much constant even over periods of millions of years.
