There's a lot of overlap between the domains of moral philosophy and political philosophy. Consequently, there's not much historical differentiation -- Kant, Mill, and Aristotle both engage in political and moral philosophy. The distinctions are in terms of the main questions that concern contemporary philosophers in each field of philosophy. Moral philosophers are concerned with questions of right and wrong or questions of virtue. This can often be done without respect to the political structures that exist or seeing these only as a backdrop. One common type of scenario in contemporary analytic moral philosophy is the trolley problem which involves whether to divert a trolley from killing more people to killing less people, etc. No one I'm familiar with asks whether you're living in North Korea, China, or France to figure out which would be moral. Some moral philosophers approach problems from the perspective of some moral framework or with reference to a historical philosopher like Kant. Others look directly at moral intuitions by using surveys. Separately, some moral philosophers look at the emotions. For instance, we can see this in the work of Martha Nussbaum or by looking at Mencius' four moral roots (See $URL$ Conversely, political philosophers look at questions about how the state should be organized. This strain historically begins in Plato (Republic, Laws) and Aristotle (Politics and one part of Nicomachean Ethics). It keeps happening in Hobbes (Leviathan), Locke (Letters concerning Toleration, Two Treatises on Government), Rousseau (The Social Contract), Kant (Perpetual Peace, Religion), Hegel (Philosophy of Right, Natural Law, Hegel's System of Ethical Life) - just to name a few works. To highlight the distinctions a bit more clearly, political philosophy is more apt to consider right/wrong action in terms of crime than morality (though not exclusively) whereas moral philosophy does not need to concern itself (in general) with whether something wrong is criminal. A second aspect that has arisen more recently for political philosophy is problems of collective action and collective responsibility. Again, the distinction is not going to be absolute but when you shift to how things work in groups you're generally moving into political philosophy rather than moral philosophy. To return to your specific phrasing, 

There's a big problem here in a place you might not expect -- "so that he is happier." In the Groundwork, Kant distinguishes between hypothetical imperatives and the Categorical Imperative (he's confident there's just one and it's unified and its complete based on pure reason). "happiness" is, according to Kant, an end everyone has but that remains hypothetical. A second thorny issue also occurs in passing. For Kant, the form that an individual's will takes is maxims which it imposes. When these maxims accord with universal reason (either reason itself or reason in the form of laws of nature applied to the world), then they are moral and agree with the categorical imperative. But as indicated, the maxim "I will make someone happy" cannot be perfectly identical with the categorical imperative -- since happiness is not for Kant a moral end per se (things get very complicated when you add Religion within the bounds of reason alone and Metaphysics of Morals into the mix on this question). In terms of slavery, Kant does mention it briefly in some places, namely Metaphysics of Morals 6:330. Elsewhere, there's some work on his view of racial slavery. I must admit I'm not particularly up to speed on those particular references -- but since your question is about the CI we can skip many of them. The way you formulate your question, you're operating from what is called the "universalization formula" of the categorical imperative. This has two specific forms -- logical contradiction and contradiction in a world where this is a law of nature. "world" for Kant is a technical term referring to something we make with our minds. In Critique of Practical Reason, Kant says lying is wrong because we owe the truth to others. This can also be formulated in terms of universal law -- viz., that if we lie, then the purpose of communication disappears since we cannot discern anything from the gibberish that we are hearing. Admittedly, this isn't a pure logical contradiction (and several articles have critiqued him on this front). But it's hard to imagine lying being effective in a world if there was a rule that people never told the truth. The same sort of universalization can apply to slavery in a world, but it might be a stretch for us to believe this works. This points to three things -- one that what we can conceive of as being possible might different from the Prussian Kant. Second, Kant tells us that there are other formulas of the categorical imperative -- some of which are going to get us much clearer accounts of why slavery is wrong. Three, that the equivalency claim in the previous sentence is somewhat dubious (an angle to critique Kant on). The easier place to get the wrongness of slavery is "The Formula of Humanity." Here, Kant again gives two articulations (I don't have the page numbers with me), but they are: treat rational beings as ends-in-themselves and never merely as means and treat humanity in yourself and other as ends-in-themselves and never merely as means. (I argue in an unpublished paper that we shouldn't put so much stock in his use of "humanity" since he clarifies elsewhere this doesn't have much to do with being homo sapiens and just means rational beings again). Slavery is treating someone as a means to your ends. In so doing, it fails to respect the rationality they have.Thus, it is wrong. Lying can also be shown to be wrong on the same logic -- as used Critique of Practical Reason: that when you lie, you are misleading a rational being and using them for your own ends. (N.b., that in Metaphysics of Morals, Kant changes the argument against lying to one where the problem is that you are not respecting rationality in yourself by engaging in this irrational behavior). As I mentioned above, Kant claims that the Formula of Universalizability and the Formula of Humanity are identically the CI -- along with a third formula about the Kingdom of Ends. Regarding manumission, Kant has an ought implies can view. Meaning, if we can identify what is the right thing to do, we should do it -- practical difficulties be damned. 

Well, there's several things that break the analogy. First, noumenal reality is not known at all for Kant. This is because knowledge for Kant has a very different meaning that it does for Aristotle. On Aristotle's model we know things as we perceive at them and reproduce a phantasm of them in our minds from which extract the essence and have knowledge in this way of the substance through its essence and particulars [i.e., accidents]. For Kant, we know things through the categories of understanding and the forms of sensibility which turn a thing into an object and phenomenon proper respectively (see the SEP entry for more details on the latter). Thus, for Kant things-in-themselves are not knoweable de minimis because they are not objects. They are inaccessible to the knowledge operation. In Aristotelian vocabulary, things in themselves are closer to absolute potential or prime matter. But they differ insofar as what comes after them is not exactly formed matter. Second, while substances, for Aristotle, are formed matter and thus when we can know the form and the accidents of a substance, the relationship between thing and phenomenon and object is not one in which the thing has inherent properties that follow from its kind. As far as we can known on Kant's account, it makes no sense to speak of kinds of things for Kant. Because thingness doesn't admit kinds -- since kinds are categories. Third, it's not entirely clear (here just inside of the Kantian picture) that we should identify noumenon with thing-in-itself. The noumenal is the realm of mind or reason -- which is not necessarily identical with the substrate of the phenomenon we perceive or the objects know. Or to put it another way, thing and object are a pair of opposites and phenomenal and noumenal are a pair of opposites as well, but it's not clear that what we do not know as objects is therefore noumenal. (This is a point on which there is some disagreement among Kant scholars). One aside is that I tend to agree with what my advisor wrote many years ago in Kant Studien. God, on the Kantian picture, does have direct knowledge of things-in-themselves just as they. This is because God does not know through the categories of understanding. 

Question 2: Would two people claiming another person told them something where the two are told different things necessarily be a contradiction? The answer to this question is not necessarily. The reason is simple. Let's say Person A tells you that Person C told them they ate a banana for breakfast on July 12. Let's say Person B tells us that Person C told them they did not eat a banana for breakfast on July 12. This is not a contradiction because what they are saying is not the same thing. A is reporting what they C told A. B is reporting what C told B.
