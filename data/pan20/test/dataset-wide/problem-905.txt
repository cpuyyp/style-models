Probably because of his perfectionism in the art he creates. Extensive interview quotes follow. Skip to the end for a summary. 

Ishmael may actually be Ahab. This is more of an extension to Matt Thrower's broader answer, but I found this theory and the evidence for it so interesting that I felt it should be written down, and it does answer the question by providing an alternative possibility for the name of Ishmael. This answer is heavily based on The Whale is a Lie, a blog post written by Verity Reynolds. 

What do these choices of gifts symbolise? What's the deeper significance of each of the twelve types of people, animals, or objects? I seem to remember reading about a Christian significance (the twelve drummers are the twelve apostles, the four calling birds are the four evangelists, and so on). Wikipedia also mentions an interpretation in terms of Catholic catechism, but also cites a source claiming that this is incorrect. I'd be interested in seeing both the evidence for and against this Catholic interpretation, and also any other reasonable interpretation of the song. A good answer would list several different possible symbolic meanings and summarise evidence for/against each one. 

Most clinching of all, the road just on the town side of the East Hill is indeed called Tackleway. This seems to be the only distinctive name which isn't altered in the novel - perhaps as a sort of Easter egg, a nudge and a wink to people familiar with Hastings. Let's check everything on a map (the red indicated point near the right-hand side is Tackleway): 

Maximou, a female warrior, appears as a character in Digenes Akrites, in a rather unlikely passage in which the hero first defeats her in combat and then is seduced by her. From Adrienne Mayor, The Amazons: Lives and Legends of Warrior Women across the Ancient World: 

Where does the idea of a "knife in your throat held after dark" come from? What does it mean and how does it fit with the overall theme? What does bloody murder have to do with working uselessly in an office for money, or is there some indirect or symbolic meaning in this phrase? 

The peasants in your quote have lives which are controlled very strictly or harshly, hence they're ruled by an iron rod. What controls their lives so much? The "soil and season" (this phrase itself is a metonym which denotes their whole environment - weather, seasons, natural rhythms of the day and year). So the metaphorical iron rods which rule them must be the iron rods of soil and season. 

With such a long history, it seems the best conclusion we can draw is that the idea of this poem has been around so long that it's pretty much a folk tradition. It's been handed down from generation to generation, probably mostly orally, and has of course changed and mutated quite a lot over the last seven hundred years. But trying to pin down an 'original author', for any particular version of the poem, is a fruitless venture in this centuries-long game of Chinese Whispers. Even today, there are many slightly different versions of the poem, and no single 'canonical' wording - just look at the number of variations listed here and here, for example. 

Points of view. Although the story is ostensibly narrated solely by Ishmael, the only survivor, some parts seem to relate things that Ishmael couldn't have known - such as Ahab's inner thoughts, or the meeting between Ahab and Starbuck without anyone else present. Admittedly we do also see the inner thoughts of Starbuck, and Ishmael can't be both Ahab and Starbuck. But Reynolds has an explanation for this which fits into the "Ishmael = Ahab" theory: 

... in the book, every single one of the ten people on the island ends up being killed, even the true mastermind behind it all; while the play has a happier ending, in which Vera Claythorne and Philip Lombard are innocent and manage to escape the island together. The Wikipedia page for the play (cited to Christie's autobiography, which I didn't find online) says: 

In the Thomas Hardy poem "The Darkling Thrush", one line seems to scan quite jarringly compared to the even iambic meter of the others: 

Marge Piercy's novel Woman on the Edge of Time presents a chilling view of the modern mental health system, by documenting the thoughts and experiences of a woman committed to a mental institution against her will. Was the author basing her portrayal on real-life experience? Had she been involved with mental asylums or mental health therapy on any level in her own life - e.g. did she know someone who'd been committed? 

As far as I remember, having read all three books several times, neither the "knight of the Empty Helmet" nor "Castle Rhack" is ever mentioned anywhere else in the trilogy. But it seems beyond weird to introduce a character only for the sake of asking a teaser question about him which is never resolved or even mentioned before or since. Is this the most blatant violation of Chekhov's Gun I've ever seen, or is there some other mention of or reference to this person that I've missed? In short: I give up. What of the knight of the Empty Helmet, and how does he comport himself at Castle Rhack? 

It's old. Like, really old. So old that it's impossible to tell where it originated. The book The Lore and Language of Schoolchildren by Iona and Peter Opie, published in 1959, catalogues many different schoolyard poems from throughout the first half of the twentieth century, including the following version of the one you're interested in: 

He also goes into a lot more detail about precisely which languages and dialects of Middle-earth correspond to which in the real (sorry, modern) world. 

One possible case of character development is in "The Adventure of the Three Garridebs" when Holmes, for the first and only time in all the canon, is shown to care for his fellow man. This may be more revealing the character that's always been hidden beneath, rather than a change in character, but from an out-of-universe point of view at least, I think it counts as character development:
