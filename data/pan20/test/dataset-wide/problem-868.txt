With normal matter, the strength of gravity depends on the stress-energy tensor, which, in an isotropic homogeneous universe, has trace of $\rho + 3p$. Note that the pressure from relativistic particles (photons and neutrinos) enhances the mass density in slowing down expansion. In inflation theory, it is assumed that there was a scalar field (perhaps) in a small section of the universe that began in a false vacuum state. That is, the field's energy density remained roughly constant as the universe began to inflate, and therefore the total energy of this field grew as the volume of the universe grew. The field's pressure was negative and greatly overwhelmed the inward force of the density of normal matter and pressure. It is this negative pressure that rapidly expanded this section of the universe by many factors. Energy was conserved because work was done by the gravitational field as it pressed inward against the field's outward pressure; the gravitational potential became very negative, while the energy density in the field became very large. Eventually, the field decayed away, heating the particles, which resulted in the traditional Big Bang conditions of a hot expanding universe. Throughout this theory, standard physics is expected to hold with just the addition of this new scalar field. It is introduced because it helps to explain why the entire visible universe today is so homogeneous even though there are subregions that were previously thought to have not been in causal contact until quite recently. It also explains why the universe is very nearly flat. It converted a small section of the universe to extremely large radii and thus small curvature. You can read about this from one of its inventors here 

There is a 1.6 meter off-axis telescope for solar observation at Big Bear Observatory called the New Solar Telescope (NST). Off-axis is particularly helpful in solar observations because it reduces stray light and eliminates a rotating diffraction pattern which can be severe when the sun is the target. However, for most astronomical work the additional costs are just not worth it, yet. The extra mechanical costs may be greater than the extra costs for the optics. The total weight of optics and supporting structures of professional telescopes can be many tons. There is additional strain required to rotate and support an asymmetric structure like this, i.e. bigger motors are needed. Galaxies are not bright enough to produce diffraction patterns and the issue of stray light from nearby bright objects is far less of a problem than the foreground stars, zodiacal light, and night sky light actually in the line of sight. If a nearby star is producing a bothersome diffraction spike, one can usually rotate the field to avoid this. I am not saying that stray light or diffraction effects are never a problem, just that this is not a top problem and, if we need to trade down in size at all for an off-axis design, most astronomers would not accept it. Perhaps if relative costs for these telescopes come down in the future, they will be more common. 

It is. Tidal disruption occurs when $\rho_{Jup}(R_{Jup}/R)^3$ > $\rho_{comet}$ where R is the separation and $\rho$ is the density. The density of Jupiter is 1.33 g/$cm^3$ and the comet was estimated to have a density of only 0.5 g/$cm^3$ based on the radius at which it disrupted. That is, disruption took place at separation R ~ $(1.33/0.5)^{1/3} R_{Jup}$. 

At the end of the protostar phase a vigorous outflow from the star develops called the T-Tauri Wind and this could cut off accretion. Eventually, it develops into a normal star and the strong wind dies down. Material that was not totally blown away could then continue to fall down and be accreted 

You could say "MJ in bins of x degrees in l" where x is the degrees spanned by a pixel. Or, you could divide the fluxes by the steradians in each column and keep it MJ/sr or "Mean MJ/sr within longitudinal bins". Now the width of the bins is not important as long as they are small. 

The pressures are so great in a neutron star that most of the electrons combine with protons and become neutrons. A statistical equilibrium is set up in which neutrons, because they are unstable, decay into electrons and protons while some electron proton pairs form neutrons. For typical neutron star temperature/pressures, at any one time about 1/7 of the nucleons are protons (with an equal number of electrons) and 6/7 are neutrons. If there were more electrons than protons, then the excess of electrons would persist since they would not have enough partners to combine with. Of course, this net charge would attract protons and other positive ions from nearby space and this would reduce the neutron star's charge. So, if you added electrons, you would change the charge of the neutron star, but the net charge would decay over time as positive particles are pulled in from space. 

Many of the moons of Jupiter and Saturn are tidally locked and probably move ice from their equatorial regions to their polar regions. Ganymede is the best example where you see bright polar ice caps and a dark equatorial zone. A migration process occurs on all of these moons in which light from the sun gets absorbed by water ice molecules and sends them on random jumps. After a long random walk, they eventually end up near the pole where they stay for a long time even if they are not in a perpetual shadow, and they stay there for nearly forever if they are. But, if the moon has a very thick coating of ice everywhere, this process may not have dug down deep enough, so it is still covered with ice everywhere, in which case it is hard to see the effect happening. 

Most, and perhaps all, stars form in stellar clusters. Most likely, the sun formed in a open cluster. In clusters the density of stars is quite high, therefore close encounters are common. So, I think it would be quite likely for such close encounters to disturb Oort clouds enough to send comets out of their host systems. Some small fraction of these comets would be recaptured by other stars within the open cluster. In addition, it is thought that in the early period of planetary disk formation, there were many more planets than today, but they often collided with each other, often sending pieces out of the stellar system. Moreove, many small planets and asteroids were thrown out by gravitational interactions with the large planets (see Tremaine). These 'debris' would be roaming interstellar space. Occasionally, one could fall into any random stellar system. The odds that we have any asteroids or comets from any particular nearby star is low, unless it happened to have been from the Sun's birthplace. We do not have the ability to determine which of the nearby stars are from the Sun's open cluster, but the Gaia Satellite may make that possible soon. And, if we explore the solar system long enough, we may find exo-solar asteroids among the hordes of asteroids. 

NASA mission data is archived at a handful of NASA archives. If you do not know which archive a data set is in, then you can search the Master Catalog at the NASA Space Science Data Coordinated Archive (NSSDC). The main astrophysics archives are: HEASARC (High Energy Astrophysics Science Archive Research Center) IRSA (Infrared Science Archives) LAMBDA (Legacy Archive for Microwave Background Data Analysis) and MAST (Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes) Planetary/Solar System Data are at the various Nodes of the PDS. NSSDC holds data from many of the older missions that predate these archives. New Horizons data is being archived at the Small Bodies Node of PDS. But, it usually takes several months for data to get into these archives. So, if you are looking for very current images, you have to rely on what the mission team has put up on its web site. That is at their discretion. 

Most binary stars are believed to have formed together as they condensed out of a common rotating dense cloud of gas and dust. A few more form when, coincidentally, two are ejected from a cluster at the same time at very low speeds. In high density stellar systems, close flybys tend to disrupt wide binary systems. This happens because energy from the flyby can be exchanged with the binary and sometimes that increases the binary orbital energy from negative to positive values (escape regime). So, if you increase the density of the galaxy (by increasing the gravitational source at the center), it is likely to reduce the number of binary systems via close encounters. However, it would take a tremendous increase in density from the mean galactic density for this to begin to be non-negligible. 

In the paper that this report is based on, 1, they simply see an annual period in the $\beta$ decay rates of radioactive isotope samples in the lab. Basically, the rate is a fraction of a percent higher in winter than in summer. They conclude that absent any simple instrumentation explanation: 

The Kepler Field had been covered in the near IR by the 2MASS catalog since that covered the entire northern sky. There was also a Smithsonian Institute program called the Kepler Input Catalog program that observed the Kepler field with the 48-inch telescope at the Whipple Observatory on Mount Hopkins, Arizona in the SDSS g, r, i, and z bands plus a custom filter centered on the Mg b lines. Also many individual objects studied by Kepler were observed in follow up studies. So, yes this is a well studied region of the sky now. Now, however, the Pan-Starrs survey has imaged most of the whole sky with several optical filters. After the reaction wheel failure on Kepler, it was repurpose as the K2 project. In this project, it observes a different part of the ecliptic plane every 3 months. Catalogs of stars and galaxies in each of these locations are created ahead of time with the EPIC survey. In addition, there is a SN/AGN search ongoing with K2 that includes simultaneous groundbased observations using various wide field imaging telescopes around the world such as the SkyMapper in Australia. A workshop on this will be held in February. 

Total energy of a system is constant. In an open universe with cosmological constant $\Lambda = 0$, the potential grows (becomes less negative) while the kinetic energy decreases at the same rate. After a long time, the velocities tend to be constant (kinetic energy becomes constant) and the potential goes to 0. But, we now think that $\Lambda > 0$. In that case, the potential energy starts off increasing but then starts to fall and consequently the kinetic energy starts out decreasing and then starts to rise. The total energy is conserved, but kinetic energy is driven to positive infinity and potential energy goes to negative infinity. The Hubble constant, $H_0$, drops throughout but, if one assumes $\Lambda$ is indeed constant, it asymptotically reaches a constant value. Therefore, with $H_0$ constant, since $v = H_0D$ [acceleration = $dv/dt = H_0^{lim}v = (H_0^{lim})^2D$], the kinetic energy forever afterwards grows as the square of the scale of the universe, $a^2$ and the potential energy scales as $\ -a^2$. The visible universe, where the recession velocity is the speed of light ($v = c$), reaches a constant physical distance . That distance is $D = c/H_0^{lim}$. 

As a star or neutron star collapses to form a blackhole there will, of course, be a moment when the matter is distributed everywhere within the event horizon. So, there may not be a singularity within a full fledged blackhole, at first. But, the inward forces within the event horizon are irresistible (considering that escape velocity is greater than the speed of light) and so everything within the event horizon must fall into a singularity. How long this takes is complicated by the issue of which reference frame you chose to time it. 

Calendars usually mark the first full day of a season rather than the day of occurrence of a season boundary. Tuesday is the first full day of autumn in the US. As for full moon, when the moon rises full in your area for the first time that lunar month or becomes full while it is above the horizon, then that is the day of the full moon. 

See $URL$ and $URL$ HALCA was a Japanese 8 meter radio telescope satellite used for Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) from 1997 to 2003. Spektr-R is a Russian 10 m dish launched into space in 2011 with apogee nearly as far away as the moon, and still going. So, yes a radio telescope in space is quite useful for long baseline interferometry. You probably do not want to also use it for deep space communications because that would interfere with the scientific use. It is also not very useful for asteroid work because the odds of one going by is not greater than the odds of one going by the Earth and there are more powerful radio dishes on the ground. Typically, one would not bother having a strong source for bouncing off asteroids on a radio telescope meant for extragalactic work. And you sure would not want to risk sending it into the asteroid belt! 

What would an observer see if they were moving at nearly the speed of light? They would see distances along the direction of motion appear shorter, but perpendicular to that direction distances would appear normal (ie. the same as observers in the non-moving frame). "Non-moving", you say angrily. "All motion is relative. How can there be a non-moving frame?" Well, there is a special frame relative to the mean of all of the mass in the visible universe and in this frame the Microwave Background Radiation is uniform over all directions in the sky. This is a natural non-moving (and non-rotating) frame for doing cosmology called the comoving frame. Now back to the moving frame. There, one observes all nearby galaxies in the direction of motion as blueshifted and all nearby galaxies behind as redshifted. Therefore, Hubble's Law would be a function of direction and would be pretty complicated unless one made all the appropriate relativistic corrections. If the observers did not know relativity, and just go ahead and simply correct Hubble's Law according to measured velocities and velocity independent distance measures, they would conclude that the universe is shaped like an oblate ellipsoid (too short in 1 direction and correct in the other 2 directions, from our point of view). But, in fact, to them it actually is that shape and they actually can travel more quickly between stars and galaxies in that 1 direction than we can (at least in their forward direction). Of course, if they land anywhere in a typical galaxy then they will be switching to the comoving frame and see a full sized spherical universe. They will also observe a Microwave Background that is quite a bit warmer in one direction and colder in the opposite direction and 2.7K in the circle between these. If they know relativity they will understand why this is and why the density of galaxies is higher in one dimension and why Hubble's Law is so complicated. But yes, their universe will be, in a real sense, smaller (in one dimension) than ours. Galaxies do all have some motion in the comoving frame and this is called peculiar velocity. The Milky Way is being pulled toward Andromeda galaxy at roughly 50 km/s and the whole Local Group is pulled toward the Virgo Cluster (the center of the Local Supercluster) at 100 - 200 km/s. Galaxies in the Virgo Cluster have velocity dispersion of 700 km/s, so some move at about twice that. And a large region around is moving at ~ 500 km/s due to superclusters at large distances. But, since these peculiar velocities tend to add up to less than 2,000 km/s, no alien race is going to be at relativistic speeds unless they are in a spaceship of their own devise. One more issue. On the time scale of a billion years or several, this moving frame will move to a location in space that is moving at a similar velocity and so they will merge with the non-moving (but expanding) frame. So, slowly their oblate universe is transforming to a spherical one, unless they have a means to continuously accelerate. 

Your intuition is correct. It does not really make any sense for the universe to have a border. Would it be an unbreakable wall? What would be on the other side? Models with a finite universe would not have a border. The universe would be curved into a closed loop like the surface of a sphere. In other words, if you go far enough in any one direction you come back to the starting point.
