Any exercise program is going to require calories to support building strength and muscle. While you make no reference to the exercises, sets, and reps you are performing, let’s assume that you are fueling your body sufficiently for the three training days. You can check that by using one of the many online calorie estimators. While they can approximate your requirements, they’re only as good as the information you provide. Even then, results may vary widely. Having established an estimated base line for the clories needed to support your training, you should then monitor your progress by collecting some metrics. You can do this by keeping a training journal that records your progress. The journal should show if you are on target for your goals by showing any improvement, or, highlighting any potential problems. As for adding running to your program, the fact that you’re asking about increasing your calories to support the running, tells me that you may already know the answer to your question. That is, if you increase your activity level by adding running twice per week, you may need to increase your caloric intake to support it. If your calories are insufficient to support your program, you run the risk of giving back any gains you’ve made since you’ll more than likely be training at a caloric deficit level. Again, you’re the one that has to determine if you’re getting enough calories (possibly from your journal), but, adding running to your program will not affect your ability to gain mass as long as you support it nutritionally. And, since it’s important to train aerobically (running) and anaerobically (strength training), you’ll have all the bases covered for a well rounded fitness program. 

This question brings back memories. I’m a competitive rower and I had a similar situation. Although, my symptoms were more situated in the rhomboid/trap region without shoulder inflammation. I did, however, have some discomfort in the shoulder. Here are some of the exercises/stretches I had to do as part of my rehab. 

I’m going to disagree with the statement that “…pretty much everyone turns their feet out slightly”. I tend to vary my foot placement, and, I know of others that do also. This includes ‘neutral’ (toes forward) placement. There are reasons to squat with different foot placements. A 2013 study, Effects of Foot Position during Squatting on the Quadriceps Femoris: An Electromyographic Study showed that foot placement did affect activation of specific muscle groups. Four foot placements were studied and the effects of each were recorded using Electromyography. The study showed that foot placement activated those muscle groups differently based on foot placement. In addition, in SQUATTING KINEMATICS AND KINETICS AND THEIR APPLICATION TO EXERCISE PERFORMANCE, looked to: 

I don’t think you can use a literal interpretation of that exercise description and superimpose “ladders” on top of it. As described, you won’t risk losing any benefit from the exercise if you modify it to fit your needs. In my opinion, you would be better off rotating each leg after each set. So, for instance, the sequence might be… 

While this may seem like a simple question to answer, in reality, there's more to it than just increasing reps. That's only part of the total equation. You'll also need to take a closer look at your current nutrition plan and other factors (cardio work, rest, recovery, discipline, consistency, etc.). And, to complicate matters, your age may also play a role in how well you accomplish your goal. You've indicated that you don't want to be “hyper ripped”. However, as a former bodybuilder, I can tell you that the process of revealing muscle mass is going to be the same. Bodybuilders (natural – non drug using) just push the process a little further, typically through calorie manipulation. In my experiences, when it came time to reveal (for competition) the muscle that I had worked so hard for, I tightened up my diet and mixed high rep training with normal strength training. First, I would try to eat as “clean” as possible, and, do so on a regular consistent basis. And, rather than “sacrificing the strength I've gained”, I would plan my training to include bouts of high rep work while also attempting to maintain strength and size. I also allowed myself a reasonable time period to accomplish my goal. 

In short, No. Sweating is a physiological reaction to heat. It’s a mechanism for your body to control heat. It’s a means of thermoregulation. In a nutshell, when your muscles “heat” up (from exercise), your body works to cool you down. And, contrary to some opinions, sweating also does not correlate to fat loss even though you may see a slight decrease in weight due to water (sweat) loss. 

I'd personally rather pursue muscle gains on a gradual basis with a sound approach to calorie manipulation. Even it if means it will take longer. 

Given your lack of space, and, the proper environment for training, I would not consider using an ez-bar or any other form of equipment. Your current situation, in my opinion, is not conducive to obtaining an efficient work out and you run the risk of injury and damaging things in the room. Rather than looking to use an ez-curl bar, etc., you should consider body weight movements until such time as you have sufficient space to train effectively. For example, using resistance bands and the bed, you should be able to train most large body parts. It may require you to be creative, but, you should be able to get an effective work out. 

The machine you show is actually another type of elliptical trainer typically meant for light exercise or cardio work. I would suggest you look at performing some active stretching following a specific program for the hamstrings. For example, following a program designed for the target muscle. You may also want to search the ExRx site for stretches. 

There's no “magic” set of exercises to get great abs. That's because great abs are a result of genetics, proper nutrition, and a long commitment to hard work. Each of of has one or more body parts that are stubborn, or, lack the degree of improvement we seek. The only proven technique is committing to a regular exercise program that works the entire body, and, resisting any urge to quit when results don't come as quick as desired. 

I don’t know that there are any “best” exercises for arm wrestling. But, I would assume that any exercise that targets the muscles involved in arm wrestling would be of benefit. To that end, I would tend to train forearms (hammer curls), biceps (curls), triceps (extensions), and, probably shoulders (presses). A strong forearm should help with your grip. Strong biceps and triceps will help stabilize your arm against your opponent. And, lastly, strong shoulders may provide that last little push when your opponent is susceptible to being pinned. If you’ve got a set of dumbbells available, they should allow you to train each of the body parts I’ve listed. 

Making “progress” is a very individual thing. And, contrary to what some on this site will have you believe, there's no “magic” training methodology to making gains/progress. Rather it's the result of synergy among optimum training, nutrition, recovery, and genetics. If one aspect of your training is deficient, it will affect the others. With the above in mind, I would suggest you take a step back and begin with self inspection. Try to determine what, if anything, is holding you back. To that end, you should consider recording your training sessions and nutrition. It's somewhat difficult to correct a problem if you don't know the cause. Lastly, as corny as this may sound, I liken training to the stock market. Most of us want short term gains when, in fact, the real gains come long term. The same holds true for a fitness lifestyle. Expecting quick gains is somewhat realistic unless you are genetically gifted. Making gains/progress requires hard work, dedication, and long term commitment. Find out what works for you and stick with it. 

In particular, in regards to foot placement, the article may provide some insight into the advice you were given: 

First, congrats on deciding to live a healthy lifestyle. Given that decision and your past history, you should consider getting a physical exam to ensure you are able to begin an exercise program designed for improving your cardio health. 

However, the study questioned the significance of the the findings and went on further to say in its conclusion: 

Granted, this is somewhat opinion based, but, I can relate to your situation, although, in a slightly more serious vein. I was a competitive bodybuilder for many years. Initially, I was diagnosed with a herniated disc, but, later diagnosed with a slightly more serious condition that ultimately required surgical intervention by a neurosurgeon. So, for your questions…. I was also told not to do anything. I think MDs tend to error on the side of caution. However, I had a good PT who impressed on me that with any back injury, it’s important to maintain a strong core and perform the stretching and flexibility exercises I learned for the rest of my life. It may sound like a burden, but, actually I benefit from it in many other ways. The most important take-away is to take your time and not rush it. Be conservative. Give it time to heal even if you feel great. I’d also suggest you get a second opinion. I did. Mentally, at least in my case, there was a sense of loss. When you perform a sport or activity that you love for such a long time, and, you’re suddenly not able to any more, it can be frustrating. I learned to train smarter. I realized that I could not compete any longer, but, that didn’t mean I couldn’t still work out. It took a while, but, I learned what exercises/movements were contraindicated and avoided them while still reaping the benefit of a fitness lifestyle. Lastly, faced with the same sort of thinking you’re currently experiencing, I decided I needed something that would both challenge me and provide a fitness benefit. I chose the sport of rowing. It may sound counterintuitive for someone with a back injury, but, contrary to most people’s understanding, rowing is a “pushing” activity (eg. leg drive) and not a “pulling” activity. Rowing can be performed year round both indoors and outdoors, on the water and off, and it provides not only an aerobic benefit, but, an anaerobic one as well. If you’re interested, I would point you to the Concept2 web site. Whatever you decide to do, run it by your Doc. Good luck, and train smart! 

Gaining muscle as a natural (non-drug using) exerciser is difficult at best. Most of us neglect the role that genetics plays in the potential for growth. Too often, we look for quick gains, when in fact, the gains come over the years. Patience is not something a person who is busting their butt in the gym typically has. I, for one, have been training for 20+ years. Looking back, I’d say that gains were few and far between in the beginning. But, fast forward to today, and I’d say I’m very happy with the accumulated effects of my training over the years. 

I'm going to slightly disagree with heropup's answer because I believe that the Pec Deck machine (type 1) and the Machine Fly (type 2) should not be discarded as training equipment since machine training does provide some advantages as well as disadvantages. The two machines you show train different parts of the chest muscles. The Pec Deck provides a greater range of motion at the finish when the elbows come together. Compare that with the Machine Fly where the elbows are wider apart at the finish. This means that the Pec Deck is better for developing the inner chest. However, since the Machine Fly provides a greater overall ROM because of the alignment of the upper arms, the outer chest is targeted more effectively. The design of the Pec Deck does not allow for the shoulders to assist in the exercise. This means better isolation work. While on the Machine Fly, the front deltoids can assist thus helping in building the outer chest. The advantages of using these two machines are: 

Exercise, in general, provides stress relief because it increases brain chemicals (neurotransmitters) called Endorphins. Endorphins are “feel-good” chemicals that boost your sense of well-being. The Anxiety and Depression Association of America suggests that 

I'd also recommend some hamstring work like lying hamstring curls. You should clear any of these exercises with your PT or personal physician before attempting to do them. 

Hypertrophy occurs when you push the muscle past what it is used to. Muscles thrive on regularity. In order for them to grow you need to change things up occasionally. I recommend varying a routine every 6 to 8 weeks of training. That may mean a number of things. For example, varying the sets, reps, or weight. Changing the order of body parts or exercises in a routine. Or, changing the intensity (eg. super sets). Getting 'sore' muscles is not a requirement for increasing mass. Neither is adding extra training days. However, training smart with consistency will lead to gains. 

There’s no right or wrong methodology for determining when to introduce cardio training in your fitness program. It pretty much depends on your personal goal. For example, if you’re a competitive bodybuilder, you’ll want to do more cardio. Typically that means on the same day you train usually at the end of your routine. From the phrasing of your question, it would seem like you’d like to balance the gains you’ve made against losing some fat. If that’s the case, I would add cardio work gradually, keeping in mind there’s no “rule” as to how many times per week you need to perform it. Performing a minimum of 20 minutes per session with the goal of steadily increasing the intensity should get you started. You can do that by adding more cardio sessions, or, increasing the amount of time you do cardio. Either way, you’ll need to pay close attention to your caloric and sleep requirements to insure you are still fueling your training and muscle growth. As for pros and cons, adding cardio will require more time at the gym. Increasing your training volume by doing cardio on the same day you train may require more recovery time than just doing the weights. You could add more training days if you do cardio on the “off” days. But, that would require more of your time. For my goals, I’d prefer to do cardio on the same day as my training. But, that’s not to say that I don’t occasionally switch the cardio to an “off” day. And, as I stated above, you’ll need to pay closer attention to your nutrition to avoid a calorie deficit. On the plus side, balancing cardio with your weight training, will provide you with the opportunity to reveal the muscle tissue you’ve worked hard to attain. And, adding cardio will certainly benefit your overall health as well. 

First, your question is very much rooted in opinion, so, here’s my opinion. You stated that you want an “Aesthetic” physique. Aesthetics implies balance. By your own admission, you’ve indicate that your “upper body is lagging”. Your current routine may not sufficiently address this concern. You should consider rearranging your training to prioritize the “problem areas” you’ve indicated. For example, if your biceps are lacking, make sure to do biceps exercises early on in your routine when you are fresh. Don’t be afraid to change your routine occasionally to address the problem areas. I’d also reconsider dropping your body fat percentage as you’ve indicated. Most bodybuilders drop to the teens and lower, but, only for the months leading up to a competition. Rather than concentrating on immediate calorie reduction, you should consider training for mass since muscle is more metabolically active thus allowing you to burn more calories. In addition, added muscle should improve your aesthetics. Lastly, I’d also consider training 5 days or less. One day of rest may seem sufficient, but, over the long term, given the volume of training you indicated, recovery may end up becoming a problem. Remember, you’re not building muscle while you’re in the gym. That occurs when your body has had a chance to recover. 

While building the lats is certainly a must for creating a “V” shape, there’s one muscle group that’s often overlooked. Working all three heads of the deltoids will add to upper body width thus enhancing the appearance of a “V” taper. Additionally, building broader shoulders will create the illusion that that your waist is smaller. This is important for those that cannot seem to develop narrow ripped abdominals.
