Not really. Total estimate US spending for Y2K $134bn in preparation + $13bn for fixing problems in first few months of 2000. That's $147bn total, which inflation adjusted to 2011 is $200bn. By contrast, total estimated US healthcare IT spending is $40bn, and only fraction of that can be attributed to IDC-10 migration. 

Yes, it can, just as much as reading or any other activity where you're looking at something close to your eyes. "Optometric Clinical Practice Guidline: Care Of The Patient With Myopia": 

This doesn't make much sense, as the only places they stormed were in the capitol. And most people were taken hostage, not killed. Also note that the original story is in the category "Folklore/Humor", which doesn't speak very high of it's credibility. 

I don't have access to detailed Deutsche Telekom financial report, but from the global one you can see that in 2012 their operating expenses were 18.3 billion euros, and they've closed they year with net loss of 5.3 billion euros. 

There are mixed claims in the question, "lack of sunshine" does not mean "above average rainfall" nor "more rainy days". It means more days with significant cloud coverage (some of which may be rainy). As you can see on below map, insolation (average sunshine energy received) of UK is significantly lower than rest of Europe. 

On-line storage If you're going to build something as big as NSA datacenter, instead of buying readily available hardware, you might go for custom builds using big data industry standards. Facebook's Open Compute Storage specifies Open Vault storage, which is designed to house 30 3.5" HDDs in 2U case. Which with currently available HDDs would mean density of 120TB per 2U. You can put 21 of these in one standard 42U high 19" rack, meaning you'd have 2520TB per rack. Each rack having a base of about 0.62m². Adding some very minimum clearance, 1m² per rack would be the very lowball estimate. That's assuming that you'd be willing to have machines custom build for your datacenter. Otherwise it's off the shelf hardware. For example Dell PowerVault MD1200 configured with 12 4TB SATA drives costs $11,254.21; That of course is retail price, which bulk orders you get hefty discounts. Similarly, you could get a cloud server such as PowerEdge C6145, which can also be equipped with 12 4TB SATA drives. They don't provide they pricing on-line, but if I remember correctly, that kind of setup it'd be around $15-20K. Both of above give you density of 48TB per 2U. Which means 1004TB per rack. NSA Utah datacenter is reported to have 10,000m² dedicated to servers (100,000m² including administrative and support buildings). So really, really high ball estimate would be that they could theoretically squeeze 25EB of cloud storage in there. That's only 0.5% of 5ZB. Off-line storage If you're considering offline archiving of data, you might use tape libraries. It's not typically used in Big Data, but then again, NSA isn't typical Big Data company. Problem is, that even with highest density IBM System Storage TS3500 Tape Library, you can store 180PB per library, which has footprint of at least 15m². Which means about 420,000m² would be needed just for the tape libraries. Whole NSA Utah complex is estimated to have "1 million or 1.5 million square feet" (93,000m²-149,000m²), but it's also been said that it's "100,000 square feet (9,300m²) of data center space and greater than 900,000 square feet (83,600m²) of technical support and administrative space" (source). Purpose of the buildings might be kept secret or intentionally misleading, external dimensions cannot. So clearly there is no way to squeeze 5ZB of tape archive there, even if buildings said to be administrative are actually purposed for tape archive. Meta-data So let's assume that even if you'd manage to somehow archive 5ZB of raw data, as I've calculated above even if you'd use all your datacenter space for on-line processing, that would mean you're storing only 5KB of metadata for each 1MB of data. While for media files that seems more than enough, I really doubt you can achieve ratio anywhere near that for emails, chats, text messages, tweets etc. Of course they might filter out information they've not interested in and not store any metadata related to that information. But in that case there is no point in archiving that information off-line, because you don't have path of access — you don't have metadata pointing to it, nor can you mine the data that is archived on tapes. Throughput Assuming that it's 5ZB per year, that's a sustained throughput of 570PB per day, or 160TB per second. Leaving apart computing power needed to process that, question is how that data would be transported there? Current internet infrastructure isn't anywhere nearly ready for that kind of traffic. Three of the biggest internet exchange points are located in Europe having maximum throughput of 2.2TBps, 2.1TBps and 1.6TBps respectively. US is trailing way behind with top US only exchanges having only 0.28TBps and 0.25TBps, another one, Equinix has total of 1.4TBps across 12 countries on 4 continents. In other words it's completely infeasible to push 5ZB per year into a datacenter, especially in such a remote location. Nor, as you can see, necessary, even if you'd want to process all of Internet traffic. Conclusion 

There are several claims about extremely huge data storage capacity in Utah, like "The NSA's Utah Data Center will be able to handle and process five zettabytes of data." (yotta = 1000 zetta = 1M exa = 1 billion peta = 1 trillion tera) Many of them comes from wrong estimations from William Binney (a former NSA technical director), according to NPR: $URL$ 

Wikipedia says that Tiger has its oil in granite, but the original source of this oil is fossil $URL$ 

With biogenic formation there are algae and bit of plants (no animals) were buried and converted into oil in some specific conditions (no oxygen, depth no more than 5 km, specific temperature) in several hundreds millions of years. Usual oil production can lift only up to 20-40 % of oil in the underground (with massive water flooding of reservoir), this is called oil recovery factor. Only very expensive and rare process, Enhanced oil recovery will change this percentage to 30-60. Human extracted around 15-20% of this in 1 hundred years; the rate of extraction is millions time faster than rate of formation. In next 50-100 years it may be possible to extract 15-20% more of oil; more then half can't be extracted. For abiotic oil genesis the paper gives two variants, weak and strong. Weak have no difference for finite oil from biogenic; and strong have no evidence to be true. Also, human will increase production rate while he can, and sometimes out extraction rate will be greater than any replacing rate (same peak of oil, just bit later):

In earliest stages of bone development, there is no calcium here, and bone is invisible in typical X-Ray. Then there are three centers of ossification (osteogenesis), first is primary center in the middle of the bone, and then two epiphyseal centers are formed at both ends of bone.

Note, that this study has been somewhat controversial, as many researches failed to reproduce any results. There are also studies, that give quite the opposite result: 

First of all, Al-Masjid al-Ḥarām (The Grand Mosque) was established in Mecca in 638. That's thousand years before Greenwich observatory was established. Secondly initial meridian is completely arbitrary. Historically there have been dozens of them. Greenwich has been established as initial meridian only in 1851 and internationally accepted in 1884. And that still wasn't universal adoption. It's sounds ridiculous to affirm that location of The Grand Mosque is based on coordinate system that didn't exist until 1250 years later. 

More on this in VentureBeat, which in turn sources The Washington Post, The Guardian, National Journal and more. 

Thus, with constant pressure, warm carbonated drink will go "flat" much sooner than cooled one. In case of sealed bottle, effect is much lesser, because solubility increases with pressure. Leaving your sealed soda bottle warm will build up pressure with CO2 escaping the water, preventing more gas from escaping the solution. This is described by Henry's law. 

The product often mentioned as having "high Apple tax" is iPad. But in fact Samsung has higher margin on Galaxy Note 10.1, than Apple on iPad. On the other hand however, Samsung also makes Nexus 10 for Google, which sells at much, much lower margin. Apple gets hefty margin from iPhone 5, however Samsung gets similarly high margin from Galaxy S3. Again, there is Nexus 4 from Google (this time it's made by LG, not Samsung), which will sell at much, much lower margin. So generally speaking, the margin on Apple products is similar to margin of other brand name premium products. However, there are exceptions, where equally capable premium products are sold with significantly lower margins (eg. Google's Nexus products). BTW. Overall tendency is for Apple's margin to go down due higher production costs and tighter competition. Hence investors' reaction on NASDAQ. 

A congressional act granting an executive "kill switch" for the internet was proposed in June 2010. It was called the Protecting Cyberspace as a National Asset Act, and it never came up for vote in Congress (i.e. died). There is a revised version of the bill in Congress now (introduced in February 2011) called the Cybersecurity and Internet Freedom Act of 2011. According to the bill's sponsor, Joe Lieberman, the revised version contains no kill switch. However, it seems that this may not be true, according to this CNET article: 

The CDC also mentions that separating vaccinations is more likely to cause discomfort to the child, which makes sense-- less stress to get all of them done in one visit, I would think. The CDC does not cite any of these studies on that page, but here's a study that I found. This is the summary (again, emphasis added): 

There seems to be plenty of anecdotal evidence (currently the 4th google result for "multiple vaccines") to confirm this, but according to the CDC, there have been studies which have found no adverse health effects associated with multiple simultaneous vaccinations (emphasis mine): 

It seems that if this is so, they could label all ISPs "critical" and prevent anyone from accessing the internet. It would probably be a lot more paperwork, but I don't think that would discourage them. So yes, this new bill (which is still in the early stages of legislature, as far as I can tell), seems to contain a weakened form of the "kill switch", but not an executive one. It wouldn't be up to the President, or any other single person, but an entire governmental department. You can read the entire bill here, but unless you can speak legalese, you might not be able to make sense of any of it, let alone know where to start. (It's unfortunate that I can't really answer your question directly from reading the bill, but such is American politics-- have to rely on sometimes-dubious third parties like news outlets to interpret legislature by proxy).

So, there will be peak, when humankind will produce some amount of oil per day (around 95-100 millions of barrels), and after this event oil production will decline. There will be a lot of oil underground, but with time it is harder and harder to get it out. Under "harder" I mean several things: high price of oil (100 $ / barrel or 200$ / barrel) is not enough to keep 95 mbbl/day level of production; we need to invest some energy into EOR processes and oil lifting. There is last point - when you need to invest same amount of energy to get the barrel which is equal to the energy of this oil barrel (EROEI = 1) - $URL$ (PS: biodiesel and Ethanol corn have 1.3 EROEI which is very low; shale oil was estimated at EROEI=3, and Canadian bitumen tar sands was estimated as EROEI=3). 

There seems to be some criticism of such studies. This criticism in particular (not all criticism) comes from the National Health Federation, which has a history of promoting claims that vaccines are dangerous, so I'm inclined to disregard it. So, in summary, no, studies have shown that it is not dangerous to have several vaccines at the same time. 

Yes, this can happen with water, and in fact other liquids as well. According to the UNSW School of Physics, this is called superheating, and it occurs when a liquid is heated to a temperature slightly above its boiling point without the liquid starting to boil. The result is an unstable liquid that can boil (steam) violently when a foreign object (i.e. instant coffee, tongue, spoon, etc.) contacts the liquid (I'll explain how/why later in this answer). This violent boiling is the "explosion" referred to in your question, and it can be quite dangerous. (Note that this is not, by definition, an actual explosion, but colloquially, it may be referred to as such. See the comment by dm.skt below.) Superheating occurs when a liquid is heated in a smooth container*, such as a brand-new mug or bowl, for a long time in a microwave. The smooth container prevents steam bubbles from forming on the surface of the container as the liquid is heated. The formation of steam bubbles is a crucial step of boiling; without steam bubbles, the liquid cannot boil, and this is why superheating is possible. Introducing a non-smooth object into superheated water allows the water to form steam bubbles on the irregular surface of the object, leading to a potentially rapid boil of the water. *Note: As a container is used and/or washed, microscopic abrasions and scratches will accumulate on the interior surface of the container, whether from stirring with a spoon or scrubbing. Thus, the likelihood of superheating occurring with any given container decreases each time the container is used and superficially scratched, because steam bubbles will form more easily the more scratches are present.
