The other answers already mention most of the adaptations that would be aimed at facilitating people on the autistic spectrum, but I expect there would be much broader changes to society and education especially. Teaching Neurotypicals to coexist With kindergarten and elementary school classrooms containing up to a third of children on the autistic spectrum, I expect the neurotypical children will receive implicit and explicit training in how to talk, play and generally coexist with their less typical classmates. They will grow up knowing that their intuitive social cues don't work on all people and as an effect start being more explicit about their intentions and expectations, even to other neurotypicals. They will also experience a lot of the varying limitations/issues their autistic classmates have to overcome and learn not to judge them but rather to recognize the limitations, accept those as a given and learn how to work around them. Languages will change Starting at schools again, "confusing" ambiguous and figurative language will be eliminated from the curriculum and discouraged at all times. Figurative speech will all but disappear from mainstream language, but flourish in art and counter-cultures. Slang will be big among the neurotypicals that resent all these changes. Autistic people are not the only ones to have problems dealing with change after all... Socialism will rise At least, societies will move to the left politically. Health care, social security and employment laws will become more comprehensive in order to accommodate the larger group of people not able to compete effectively in the rat race being sold as the freedom to make your own destiny. Politics will change in other ways as people on the autistic spectrum will not "vote with their gut feeling", but more likely sift through detailed election programs to find the correct candidate. They will become a powerful voting bloc immune to the likes of Donald Trump or Ted Cruz. One job for life will return Autistic people will be in a position to demand and receive (see the previous point) a more stable work life, where companies face high payouts and/or transition costs if they want to fire people (any people, not just autistic) as well as extensive orientation and training costs when they hire a new employee. Notice periods may extend to a year and promotions will planned out several months ahead with the employee in question. Additionally, companies will receive tax benefits when they employ people with more severe limitations, allowing them maintain a good productivity to labor costs balance. Companies will compete vigorously for the high-functioning autistic people especially and lure them in with life-long career prospects and plenty of time to work on their fields of interest. Overall, companies that learn how to effectively employ and nurture people on the autism spectrum will reap the benefits, while the neurotypicals that thrive on competition, rivalry, etc. (think psychopathic CEOs and greedy bankers) will end up concentrated in relatively few companies, because they scare away a large part of the talent and so are not welcome everywhere anymore. 

The vast majority of expensive military hardware currently in use is aimed at defeating other armies' expensive military hardware. That kind of hardware would be almost impossible for any independent armed force to obtain or maintain. You can scrap 90% of those from the budget. Think nuclear subs, long range bombers, ICBMs, all except one or two naval carrier groups, artillery divisions and large tank battlegroups, they're not needed anymore. Small rapid reaction forces are pretty much all that is needed, with a handful of planes or or drones giving instant air superiority and boots on the ground being the most vital part of any mission, because bombs don't restore peace, people do. No, it will not help that much to spread global peace. The single global army would probably be spread thin putting out fires all over the world and getting itself into all kinds "quagmires" that takes days to get into and years to get out of. It can't get too heavy-handed for fear of protests against its legitimacy but it can't let people arm themselves either. In addition, it would end up like the UN army now: composed of regiments from many different countries that clash about languages, culture, chains of command, etc. It would get worse when it's the only army, so all countries are jockeying for more influence over it to protect their interests. The army may end up paralyzed whenever it is called on to act against the interests of one of the more powerful factions, very much like the UN now because of veto powers. Over all, not much will change except that the politics are happening inside the single government and inside the army, rather than between governments. 

If the population of the islands is still 100k+, you should have 30-40k adult males, all of them at least familiar with hunting weaponry. They should be able to defend themselves against ~1000 soldiers and sailors, unless they line up on the beach to greet the cannon fire. Still, they can do much better by preparing. The tactical situation is highly asymmetrical: The Europeans have superior weapons and can dominate at sea, but are vastly outnumbered on land and need to get supplies ASAP when they arrive. The islanders on the other hand can afford to retreat and wait out the Europeans, but cannot force a win in battle without losing many men, nor can they touch the ships unless they get really lucky. First of all, the Islanders should prepare by building fast sailing ships with shallow bottoms, as rowing boats will not be able to outrun the European ships. Sailing and shipbuilding experience from the original stranded group will be highly valuable. These ships are mainly for scouting, relaying messages between the islands and if possible, luring the big European ships onto reefs. Second, they should relocate any sizable settlement inland, uphill and out of cannonball range. The original huts/houses can be left as a decoy. All paths leading up to the settlements from the beach should be winding, pass through dense jungle where possible and have ready-to-deploy barricades and traps that prevent large groups from passing. Given the number of hunters, littering the jungle with traps shortly after the new fleet is sighted should be feasible. Then the islanders should prepare to deny the Europeans their most important resource: drinkable water. Every stream reaching the beach should have guards in place upstream that can deploy poison or rotting carcasses etc. into the stream the moment they spot a European landing party. If the Europeans venture further inland, they can be ambushed in the jungle, away from their ships. On the smaller islands, this should not be too hard, but on the main island there will be a lot of places to guard. Some kind of long distance warning signals will help. The rest is standard guerrilla tactics: Harass the landing parties, lead them into traps, never engage directly. Sap their will to continue and chase them away. Oh, and if they leave the ships poorly defended on a dark night, it's party time! Finally, a note: Guns of the time were mostly one-shot affairs, as it took a long time to reload, more than was available in a pitched fight. This limits the technological advantage of the Europeans when they are vastly outnumbered. Even if all 1,000 Europeans were to march on the king's city together, they'd most likely lose to the 10,000+ fighters the king could muster in his defense.
