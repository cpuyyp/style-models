This question has never been answered in a satisfactory manner. Wigner was the first pointing out that here is a deep question. 

This definition is expanded in the book "David Deutsch: The Fabric of Reality, Penguin 1997" in the chapter Criteria for Reality. Deutsch writes: "It [a certain example] also illustrates the criterion for reality that is used in science, namely, if something can kick back, it exists." But on a deeper level, giving a precise definition of existence is a difficult task. Hence sometimes one takes existence as undefined basic term in the sense of being real, in contrast to being only possible. And the question of the existence of general concepts, e.g. of ideas or mathematical objects, is an issue of perennial philosophical discussion. 

1) The first means to overcome errors, which are due to a wrong interpretation of sense data, is to repeat the observation under different conditions, to change the experiment, and to verify the result by several groups of experimentators. The latter serves to eliminate the subjective impact of the observer. By these means certain illusions can be detected, e.g., the illusion of the stick in water, which is observed as broken. 2) But there remain wrong interpretations of sense data which cannot be resolved this way, e.g., the observation that the sun rises in east and sets in west. Here one has to change the ambient theory. History shows that it can be a long way to overcome this kind of illusion and to detect, that it is not the sun which moves but the earth. These errors can only be detected and corrected in the context of a whole theory, not by focussing solely on the observation in question. 

As far as I know Plato's dialogues are fictitious. E.g., Parmenides died at about 460 BCE in the South of Italy, while Socrates was born at 470 BCE in Athens. Hence the meeting of Parmenides with a young Socrates, teaching Plato's theory of forms, cannot be historical. Even when the dialogues are fictitious, some of the interlocutors in Plato's dialogues are historical, e.g., Aristophanes, Alkibiades, Agathon, Socrates in Plato's Symposion. But we do not know, whether such a meeting actually took place and whether the participants hold their speeches as recorded by Plato. Usually Plato lets others express his own philosophical thoughts and claims, most notably Socrates. Plato's work with the highest probability for historical truth is the Apology, with the two speeches of Socrates. 

If you use induction to create conjectures, e.g. the Riemann Hypothesis, that's quite OK. Every method is allowed to create conjectures. Using induction to create conjectures is the method of generalisation. The crucial point is how to confirm the conjecture. Obviously in mathematics the only method is to prove the conjecture - or to disprove it by generating a counter example. But in science one cannot prove general results. A finite number of confirmed cases does not increase the probability that the general result is true. That's the problem of induction. 

Unfortunately I do not know a contempory philosopher of the same rank as philosopher and the same background in science like Bertrand Russell. As a substitue I recommend 

I would like to add some issues, which possibly complement virmaior's answer. Anybody who works in philosophy of mathematics should have his own experience in a broad field of mathematics. He needs an overview over different fields of mathematics. And he should have done own research, e.g., on the level of a PhD in pure mathematics. Why not continuing with mathematics and in addition taking some courses in philosophy, in order to base a later decision on a broader experience with both disciplines, mathematics and philosophy? 

The question “Is the noumena in a sense apeiron?” addresses topics from four different philosopher: Anaximander, Plato, Aristotle and Kant. 

IMO, it is open to discussion whether epistemology, political philosophy or ethics is the most important branch in the present time. Epistemology because it is the basis for all kind of intellectual orientation and explanation. Political philosophy because it addresses topics with consequences about the legitimation of different political constitutions. Ethics because it discusses general rules for human conduct and the different ways of justification. Is there any need to decide the question? 

Those who commit those crimes are not the same as those who subscribed to the dream. Those who subsribed to the dream changed their opinion. Ideas and dreams are not strong enough to suppress actions which offend these dreams. Actions can be induced by more powerful drives and desires. 

In particular, all meaning is in the brain because the world-model is in the brain. Added: What are possible objections? 

You can skip point 3 and the detour via neuroscience. A utilitarian ethics does not work better with the evaluation according to point 3 than by a direct evaluation according to point 2. Hence I do not see any benefit from bringing neuroscience into discussion. The philosophical problem remains how to derive prescriptions, i.e. normative statements, from descriptive statements without bringing in at least one normative axiom. Therefore I do not see how your proposal contributes to link empiricism and ethics. As far as I know your proposal has not been advanced in the literature. 

There are different possibilities to structure the history of philosophy. Besides the chronological order, a different order is according to philosophical problems or subdisciplines. In my opinion, which order to choose depends on one's personal predilections. The important point is to read texts which one finds interesting, perhaps even stimulating. So you may read Thomas Aquinas before Aristoteles if you find Aquinas Summa Theologica a breakthrough. But I recommend, to read in any case some of the landmark texts, e.g., from Parmenides, Plato, Aristotle, Thomas Aquinas, Descartes, Hume, Kant, Nietzsche, Popper. 

For both terms to think and to know philosophical definitions exists: To think means in according to a classical definition 

Kant deals with the statement in Chapter 3 (= 3. Hauptstück) Metaphysical Foundations of Mechanics, Proposition 2 of his Metaphysical Foundations of Natural Science. This passage presupposes the principle of conservation of substance. Kant calls this principle a theorem from General Metaphysics. So what Kant really does in his Metaphysical Foundations of Natural Science, is no more than to specialize a general principle about substance to a special principle about matter. It is interesting that Kant here simply refers to the philosophical tradition and quotes one of the fundamental metaphysical principles. He makes no attempt to argue why conservation of substance is a valid principle. Neither does he give any argument why the abstract, and at best qualitative concept of substance equates with the quantitative concept of matter. Did Kant consider it not necessary? As @Conifold comments, one year later in the first analogy (Critique of Pure Reason B224f) Kant makes up for a proof of the metaphysical principle of conservation of substance. He uses the equation 

Ideas are not actors. Actors in ethics are always persons. Hence moral ideas cannot corrupt themselves. But persons can misinterpret or abandon ideas. Or as you axpressed it "we [are] the ones to corrupt moral ideas." Added after your comments: As I understand from your comments, your question is: 

One English edition is Smith, Trey; Paul, Alex: Around the Tao in 80 Days. 2009. The title alludes to the famous book of Jules Verne and also to the 81(!) Chapters of the Dao De Jing. The book authored by Smith and Paul is a nice translation and introduction. It stays on a middle path between the trivial on one hand and excessive pensiveness on the other. Chapter 11 is entitled by the editors Much Ado About Nothing: 

According to the philosophy of Critical Rationalism, metaphysics stops being speculation exactly at the point when its speculations become testable. Testable means that we can confirm or falsify the metaphysical thesis. Note: To confirm does not mean to prove. 

In general, one starts with propositional logic. It is a 2-valued logic. Every statement can be proved with the help of truth tables. Propositional logic is also the logic we use in our every-day reasoning. The study of propositional logic was initiated by Aristole, e.g. in his books of metaphysics. You can learn propositional logic from any elementary textbook of logic or introduction into logic. The next step could be either predicate calculus or modal logic. 

The original sentence “I observe myself” simply means that I observe some of my properties, characteristics, traits, preferences etc. The sentence is free from any contradictions. In personality psychology the term the Self is used in a legitime way, sometimes meaning the idealized picture a person has of himself. 

Part 1, question 2, article 3 from Aquinas, Thomas: Summa Theologiae enumerates five ways to prove the existence of God: 1) God as the first mover (primum movens) 2) God as first cause (causa efficiens prima) 3) God as necessary by himself (necessarium per se) 4) God as cause of being, and goodness (causa esse, bonitatis, perfectionis) 5) God as the designer of the ends (causa finalis). The first way is taken from Aristotle’s Physics, book VII and VIII. The second way is taken from Aristotle’s Metaphysics, book II. The third way is similar to a reasoning from Aristotle’s Metaphysics, book XII. But Thomas changes the argument supporting the claim that not everything passes away. I agree, inductive reasoning and starting the chain of reasoning with a first cause is common to all five ways, not only to the first three. My conclusion:
