While the prospects are more of an economic question, I can answer that there is at least one study using machine learning methods ($URL$ There are problems such as the attribution of error to physical processes are not feasible, the spatial extent of the model is very limited, the accuracy of the model is dependent on the history and integrity of the data, etc. Perhaps a hybrid, some sort of Model Output Statistics could be formed, but this would be doubly expensive. 

In addition to the rarity, there is also the problem of additional computations. To find out if there is a solar eclipse, you need extra calculations. Since the introduction of additional calculations can slow down the model, especially since radiation is oft quoted as the most expensive physics parameterization, introduction of the astronomy may provide unnecessary calculations. A solar eclipse, while influential, is only influential in the short term, so it is often ignored. Even then, the data assimilation methods can correct for any error after the eclipse (though that would be an interesting project). Plus there is also the complication of clouds, etc. Any forecaster who pays attention to the news knows about the eclipse. Any forecaster who knows the inner workings of models (though many don't) should know that eclipses are ignored in radiation parameterizations. So forecasters should know that it will impact their forecast, but by how much, was uncertain. There are things that are ignored in weather models, but we know we ignore them. We ignore them because the are small, difficult to moddel, poorly understood, etc. Such things include aerosols, tropospheric chemistry, tornadoes, heating from lightning, anthropogenic heat flux, drag from buildings. 

Now there are plenty of limitations, such as the nonlinear version of that equation. If I had my notes on hand, then I could address those problems more. I'll edit this when I can. Also, model physics cannot be computed in spectral space, so there has to be conversion from spectral to physical space and vice-versa. I'll check my notes and correct any errors I can find later. 

Extratropical cyclones are relatively well understood. They often follow the Norwegian Cyclone model, which was developed in the 1910's and 1920's. Because of their spatial extent, extratropical cyclones are often less intense than their tropical counterparts. Since they are so much larger and live longer over land, it is easy to get data about an extratropical cyclone. Tropical cyclones, on the other hand, have faster winds and affect people in a more dramatic fashion. If an extratropical cyclone is announced in winter, a grocery store may run out of bread. If a tropical cyclone is announced, there may not be a clerk available to restock the shelves. Tropical cyclones often don't live very long over land and are smaller, so it is hard to get data about them. Because they are smaller and the wind speed change over distance is so much greater in extratropical cyclones than tropical cyclones, errors in the forecast tend to have more of a dramatic effect on tropical cyclones. To summarize: 

There are a number of factors that went/are going into the population explosion, food is only one vaccination and antibiotics are a big factor as well. within food fertilizer is again only one of many factors. Better crop strains, mechanized and better farming techniques, soil science, pesticides, refrigeration, and a dozen other factors contributed. Keep in mind artificial fertilizers get less important as you go back in time as well so calling it the detonator is incorrect and misleading. Now when considering crop rotation, crop rotation has pros and cons, there are several nutrients plants need and rotation only helps with some of them, and it relies on having compatible crops to rotate which not every crop or environment has. Keep in mind the piece wikipedia is quoting is not a peer reviewed paper but an essay in nature, which explains it is referring to several modern countries that fertilize almost exclusively with artificial fertilizers. It is not claiming they cannot use other fertilizers. 

Your best bet with something like this is find the nearest museum and bring it in, they will be familiar with the local geological artifacts. From just the photos it is hard to check for all the marks we would expect from a natural mold. As Ash said there is a chance it is just a pseudofossil but without being able to see all the internal surfaces I do not feel confident saying for sure. 

Because it is not the strong portion that gets displaced. The mantle just below the crust bends, just like the crust above it, together they make up the lithosphere, It is not the thing being displaced it is the thing doing the displacing. The asthenosphere is being displaced. Your image is missing something important. 

It mostly has to do with three factors, numbers, fecundity, and behavior. Let's start with the last, certain behaviors that increase your chances of surviving are far more likely in smaller animals things like burrowing, and hibernation. They are also more likely to be generalists able to eat almost anything, specialization is a death sentence during a major environmental change. They also require less total amounts of food as individuals, it is far easier for a rat to find enough food to survive in a wasteland than an elephant, This is also true in comparing cold-blooded vs warm-blooded animals. Second you have numbers, there are several billion rats in NYC alone, even with the total destruction of the city it is very easy for a some rats to happen to be lucky enough to survive, small animals will die in larger numbers but there are so many of them they are more likely to have some survive. They literally have the law of large numbers in their favor. Last is reproduction, size is connected to reproduction, an elephant reproduces once every two years under ideal conditions, while a rat can breed every 24 days, so even if a few elephants do survive they repopulate so slowly they may never recover and some other minor event may finish them off. So if you combine these not only are small animals more likely to survive they can recover far faster than most large animals, so all things being equal you should expect small animals to be better at surviving and diversifying after a event. 

'Locally' and 'synoptically' are conflicting adjectives. Synoptic means overall, or large horizontal scale- think thousands of kilometers. You are right on some accounts. Synoptically, pressure doesn't change much, depending on your qualitative definition of 'much.' On a percent scale or day-to-day experience, absolute temperature fluctuates more than pressure. But the gap of those fluctuations result in changes of density, leading to changes in buoyancy. The vertical momentum equation :$$\frac{\partial w}{\partial t}+(\vec{v}\cdot\nabla_H)w+w\frac{\partial w}{\partial z}=-\frac{1}{\rho}\frac{\partial P}{\partial z}- g + \nabla^2w$$ when applied to synoptic scales can be treated as approximately hydrostatic: $$\frac{\partial P}{\partial z}=-\rho g$$. From this equation, as well as the ideal gas law, the hypsometric equation may be derived. Although the vertical gradient of pressure is large, gravity is also large, which explains why the atmosphere is not lost to space and vertical motions aren't usually large in horizontal scale. Using said hypsometric equation, it can be shown that changes in vertically-averaged temperature lead to synoptic scale changes in surface pressure. 

This may/may not actually answer your question "Do warnings verify better" because of the qualitative word "better" and other factors that play a role, such as terrain and forecasting office. Another factor to consider is the nature of the warning and size of the phenomenon. A radar, for example, may not be the best tool to show verification of a hurricane, but it may be better for verification of a tornado. I hope to answer your question by taking arguments to the extreme. If warnings verify more and more accurately as the warnings get closer to the radar, they may end up in the "cone of silence," where the angle of the radar would not be able to capture the phenomenon. The opposite of that statement would be that warnings are more accurate the farther away the phenomenon is from the radar. This is also absurd, not only is resolution of the radar cut, but the curvature of the earth also makes this idea absurd. Conclusion: there is some middle ground. If you get to close, you may not only be endangering your radar (depending on the phenomenon) but you may miss data. It also matters what angle your scan is at. I would hypothesize that anything within the highest elevation angle of the radar would have the highest accuracy, but it would really matter what the phenomenon warned is and what size the phenomenon is. Warning zones are issued by people, and people have flaws. I would hypothesize that your results may not be conclusive, since the habits of each WFO may vary. For example, a winter storm warning in Georgia is an inch of snow and ice, while Boston would need 6 inches of snow to issue a winter weather watch. Some areas see tornadoes more often than others, leading to some inherent biases, etc. 

biologically produced ones like coal and other petrochemicals. Marble, limestone, Diatomaceous earth, and other such minerals are candidates as well. Manganese oxides may be a good candidate the biologically formed ones have several unique industrial applications due to having an unusual microstructure. It is also most easily mined from seafloor sediment. 

Basically oceanic crust is guaranteed to be reworked eventually, check the age of oceanic crust, while continental crust has a more random factor involved meaning some in the more stable regions of some continents has not been reworked. That is why they are only small scattered areas. 

Sonar (passive or active) or ground penetrating radar with both work, it can also be estimated from a published geologic profile of the area which are often built from both in addition to drill data. 

It mostly has to do with the type of convergent boundary the Himalayas are, continental crust to continental crust. Most convergent boundaries are oceanic to continental or oceanic to oceanic. In both cases there is a dense oceanic plate that can get subducted. But in a continental crust to continental crust collision neither can really dive under the other and get reworked*, since both are low density, thick, and roughly equal in density, so they just compress together like pushing two wads of clay together. They build both up and down since they sort of float on the rock below. Think of it kinda like a geologic iceberg, it is too light to sink. All compressive collisions thicken like this to a lesser extent, due to the compressive forces, it is just far more intense with continental to continental collisions because there is no other outlet for the energy but compression because all the material involved is to light to be subducted. . the Eurasian and Indian plates are both large continental plates so as long as they are getting forced together they can only get thicker and thicker. This is the only boundary like this on earth right now, so it seems weird to us, but this type of collision has happened before they are just rarer. *sometimes one does go down more than the other but it does not get reworked, they just get fused together in a lopsided fashion. 

the first one would have been the entire planet soon after it formed (~4.4 billion years), the planet had to cool quite a bit before liquid water could exist. deserts basically predate all the other climes on earth.
