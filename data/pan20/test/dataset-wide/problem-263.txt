I don't know exactly why you want the hoatzin to evolve hands, and the birds already have legs, but the best answer is to make the birds need to climb. At present, only the chicks need to climb, so only the chicks have claws, but the adults are pretty bad fliers, so it wouldn't take too much to push them to stop flying all together. This simplest way for this to happen would be for the climate to change a little. Let's say we have a rain-forest just perfect for the modern hoatzin. It's got lots of trees with lots of branches perfect for hoatzin nests, and lots of leaves for the birds to eat. Now, hoatzins really only glide from branch to branch, they don't really flap much because their muscular structure really isn't set up for flapping. If the hoatzin didn't have a lot of branches fairly close together, it would have a right difficult time getting about. Of course, in a rain-forest there are lots of trees with lots of branches all very close together because there is plenty of sunlight and water for all of them. What would change this could be a climactic shift, I would propose to a wetter but cooler climate. All this would take is some cloud cover. With less sunlight, the trees devote all their energies to being taller and they put all their branches up top, where they can gather sun. The lower levels of the jungle are plunged into almost total darkness, very bad for plants, so the trouble of branches all over the place is cleared up. When the birds fall out of the nests, or out of the trees, or end up in the water for whatever reason, they have to climb to get back up into the trees. There is no longer the option to fly up, especially not out of the water. Then, with clouds comes rain. Lots of rain. The hoatzin already lives where there is a lot of standing water, so it wouldn't take too much to flood the rain-forest floor. This would take care of all that pesky underbrush that the birds might use to hop-fly back up into the trees. Think swamp: tall trees sitting in water, not too much cluttering up the way-up from the ground-level. The hoatzin sits on its eggs more to keep them cool than to keep them warm, so the birds can't be away from the nest for too long. Climbing up and down the trees isn't the fastest thing to do, so a cooler climate would help select for climbers, or at least, not select against climbers. The original needs for climbing (get back to the nest, climb out of the water) are still present and are exaggerated. What's more, this shift in climate can occur with some rapidity. It wouldn't take eons and eons for a jungle to turn into something of a swamp, which means that the birds will be forced to select for a right-now trait (like claws that remain into adult-hood) instead of a slower trait (like a progressively better flight muscular structure), but it will take long enough that the birds would have time to evolve, not just be wiped out by the sudden change in conditions. As the rain-forest becomes more and more swamp-like and the foliage changes, the hoatzin will have even less need or opportunity to fly. In the beginning, the birds will still fly between the tops of the trees, but with the expanding breadth of the tree-tops, they won't have to. As the trees strive to collect as much light as possible, their canopies will become less vertical and more horizontal, so the hoatzin will be able to hop more than fly, and its progressively longer-lasting claws will help it to do so. When these original trees die, the dark ground level will not permit as many saplings to take hold, so in perhaps a hundred years or more, when the first trees have died and the second generation has begun to rise, the forest will be less dense, meaning the trees don't have to compete as much for the light and their canopies will thin out again. At this point, the hoatzin has experienced some 30-40 generations since the environment began to favor adult claws. That's not a lot, but it's enough to give the hoatzin 2.0 a good basis of flightlessness because along side the selection for claws, the hoatzin is experiencing a lack of selection for flight structures. The reason the modern hoatzin does not fly well is because the structures needed for it to eat leaves conflict with the structures it would need to fly, so when the balance is tipped, relieving the need for flight while holding the need for digestion steady, we will see the worsening of flight structures. With the trees becoming farther apart, the hoatzin will have to get from one to the other, but it's flight ability has been reduced to clumsy gliding at best. The birds will have to climb back into the trees when they attempt to glide and miss, but they will also have to start developing better ways to get about in the trees. There will be a die-off as the second generation of trees replaces the first generation, and birds with longer wings will be selected for because they can reach farther to get from branch to branch. The half of the wing that follows the claws will get shorter as the part that precedes the claws gets longer, bringing the wing into a more arm-like appendage. The same pressures will select for longer legs as well, leading to a long-armed, long-legged, clawed bird that spends almost all of its time in the tree-tops. Eventually, it might be necessary for the swamp to begin to return to the rain-forest conditions (as we know, monkeys do not live in swamps {except the Allen swamp monkey, but it dives, so I'm not counting it} for the same reason: nothing to swing from/to) which will provide the hoatzin 2.5 the structures needed for flightless, grabby locomotion. The end result will be the hoatzin 3.0, a feathery, egg-laying creature with long scaly legs,and long arms with claws at the ends that swings through the jungle almost like an ape. If you then wanted the hoatzin to evolve into a human-oid, you need simply follow the ape-to-human evolutionary track. Granted, this all involves a lot of time, a lot of things happening just right, and a lot of assumptions, like that the trees the hoatzin eats would survive this kind of change long enough for the hoatzin to switch foods, but it is, in theory, given ideal circumstances, possible. 

Messenger and Joker should both have to cause a death without killing the person. Both of their skills are very useful to the group, which means there is no reason to kill them unless they have something to gain from betraying the group. The Messenger is a great player, if you can trust him to actually send the message you want him to send. If he doesn't, he'll get you killed, one way or another. The group has to weigh the benefits of keeping the messenger alive, if they find out who he is. That also means that the Messenger has two ways to play the game: he can tell the group who he is and hope they'll think he's worth keeping on, or he can hide himself and try to lure someone astray. Likewise, the Joker has a nifty skill set, if he's on your team. I imagine that the Joker could pull off all kinds of magic tricks for his allies, but he could also trap and trick his enemies. Like the Messenger, he has two ways to play the game: he can tell the group or he can make his own way. Now, seeing as you have a Betrayer already lined up, I don't know what the rules are about other members betraying, but both the Messenger and the Joker are in prime positions to betray. In addition, setting these conditions for the Joker and the Messenger guarantees you two deaths, as either they will both kill one person, or the others will kill them both. If you pick the right person to be the Joker, you might get many more that the required three deaths. 

This is like asking why a book is better than an ebook, or why a letter is better than an email. No matter how convenient or easy or clean something is, there's just something about knowing it's real. People keep pets to pet, yes, but ask anyone with a pet, even people who just have a fish, and each and every one will tell you that their pet is a person too. It has a personality. It has likes and dislikes and quirks that make it unique. Yes, a robot could be programmed to have a little randomness, to develop x number of quirks, to develop tastes. You could take all the good things about pets and make them real in a robot, and you could get rid of all the bad things, but really, what makes pets special is that they're real. A stuffed animal is still soft, it will still snuggle you, you can heat it up and it will be warm, but it will never be truly real. That's the difference. It doesn't matter how good an imitation something is, if you changed anything at all, even things that are clearly for the better, it's not real anymore. There's a reason people don't write books in which nothing bad happens, and why there are no movies where nothing goes wrong: life is about the moments when something sucks, when it breaks, when everything goes wrong, when plans go awry, and just basically the worst moments because those are the ones that make the person, and those are the ones that make the pet. That being said, having a real pet is definitely an endeavor. It's hard, it's dirty, and it's expensive. It takes time and love and forgiveness, things that not everyone has. I could very well see how the general populace might end up with robot pets. Easier, cheaper, safer... it's basically fast-food. You know it's not real, but it's quick and easy and it'll do. People still want to sit down and eat real food, though, and the same would be true with real pets. The wealthy, who had the time and money, would have real animals, and they would probably flaunt the fact whenever they had the chance. Real pets would become a status symbol, like fur coats, and just like fur coats, faux pets would do their best to imitate the real thing, but they would never replace knowing that what you have is really real. 

It's easy. If you want everyone to know that every system of belief is true, yet still have people believe different things, just give people different gods. All the gods are real, but only some people belong to each god. You could have, say, the god of carpenters, or the god of a certain town. You could do by race or location or occupation or food source or basically anything you want. Obviously, carpenters won't pray to the farmer god, and cattle farmers might want more glory for their god than for the pig farmers' god. You can still have religious wars, even if everyone knows everyone is right. You could also have everyone know everyone is right and thus get along, even though different people worship different gods. If you don't want everyone to know everyone is right, set it up so the gods themselves are fighting. God A tells his followers that he is the only god. God B tells his followers that he is the only god. God C says it's actually all just him. The followers, therefore, believe that everyone else is either mistaken or evil. Magic could be an extension of the god. Perhaps magical items are those that have been blessed by one or another god, or that were forged in the gods' realm. Maybe gods curse some people to have some magical trait, or bless people to have some other trait. Maybe magic is it's own religion, just the force of life that some people can understand and use and that some people just can't. 

I'm going to assume that, seeing as we've all agreed that this society is a fiction, not a reality, we can pause time while we set up the society. If we have to do the prep in real-time, this becomes much, much harder. To start with, sort the population. If everyone is going to be happy, everyone should be doing something that they are naturally inclined to do. Don't fight nature. Sort the people into general groups; those that just want to please, those that want to do physical work, those that want to do intellectual work. These groups can be subdivided as needed, taking into account both the needs of society and the inclinations of the people. When each person has a job, and not just any job, a job that fits him, a job that feels natural to him, then he has a purpose. People need a purpose. Once the initial sorting has been done you'll have to sort the following generations. Unlike many real-world models, this cannot be solely based on lineage. When a child is very young she will take a test designed to measure her aptitude for each of the job sections. Based on her scores, she will go to an appropriate school, tailoring education for the field she best fits. After several years, when she is old enough to have a more pronounced personality, she will take another test. The results will be used in the same way and the child will continue her education. When she is ready to enter the workforce, she will take one final test, this one to make sure that she has been properly trained and the only one that she can truly fail. If she fails, she will be sent through the system again. If she passes, she will continue on into the work force. These tests will include both physical and mental aspects to screen for all the possible jobs. In the schools, the prime directive will be ground into every child's head. Parents will teach their children to put others first, schools will enforce it, life will revolve around it. There will simply be no other way. When the children are sorted into their first schools, they will be taught how important their work is. Each piece is vital to the functioning of society. It will be impressed upon them that they are very important, as is everyone else, and that they must do their best because they have a very important purpose in life. Children will also be taught to gauge happiness. If person A wishes to hit person B, they must both be able to figure out which action will make which person happier. Will hitting person B make person A happier than not being hit will make person B? If the two cannot reach a decision, they will take the issue to another person who, in the interest of the greatest happiness, will pass a ruling. When the children are raised to be self-sacrificing, they will have no problem continuing a society built on the happiness of others. Now, some order must, of necessity, exist, so one of the classes will be a ruling class. This doesn't mean a king or queen or anything, just the managers and such. Some people will be happier giving orders, others will be happier following them, and there is a place for both kinds of people. Children with more ambition will be groomed for leadership positions, children with less ambition will be groomed as underlings and everyone will be happy. The bottom of the order will be the rabble (as in 'the common rabble' not because they are less worthy than their higher-ups but because this class will have to be the largest and thus this sort of person will be the most common) who will follow orders and will have to make very few decisions. People who are very amiable and who dislike conflict will be in this class. Above the rabble will be the directors. Directors will oversee the rabble in their work, passing along instructions and ensuring that the work is done properly. The directors will not actually make many management decisions. Their purpose is quality control and communication between management and workers. Detail-oriented people with strong communication skills will make up this class. Above the directors sit the judges and the queens (like in a bee-hive). The queens make most of the decisions about society like how much of what to produce and which classes need more workers and that sort of thing. The judges will watch these proceedings and judge their value. They will act as advisors to the queens, taking data from the directors and interpreting it to get ideas for what should be done. Judges will not actually make decisions, they will simply look at the data and suggest possible courses of action. The queens will look at the courses, weigh the options, and make the final decisions. The judge class will be made up of emotionally challenged people. Those who can crunch numbers but cannot deal with emotion or people will be judges because they don't have to worry about the people; all they have to do is interpret the data and offer courses of action. The queens will be the people with high empathy as well as ambition. They will look at the judges' proposals and the effects that those proposals would have on society and they will choose the best option. They will pass the orders down to the directors, who will relay it to the rabble, making the course come to pass. Alongside the queens and judges will be a secondary group of queens, a group I'll call the kings. The kings will sit in with the queens and judges, hearing all societies needs and problems that need to be solved. The kings will work with judges, deciding what problems require sterner measures. Inevitably, problems will arise in society, probably in the form of wayward and rebellious people who are out for their own happiness, not the prime directive. They are the problem of the queens, just like crops and manufacturing. These people will be brought back into the fold when possible, but if there is no way to correct their troublesome behavior, their cases will be passed on to the kings. The kings will seek the advise of the judges and will dispatch their underlings, the knights, to fix the problem. The class of kings will be made of the same people as the class of queens, but the kings will have less empathy and stronger constitutions. While queens need only deal with materials and keeping people happy, the kings must be able to eliminate problem people from society. The knights will be under the direct and sole authority of the kings. Knights will be the police of sorts, arresting those people who cannot be brought back to society. Like the judges, knights will have little empathy. They will also be physical, not intellectuals, and have a strong drive to please, keeping them loyal to the kings. A small sect beside the knights will be the executioners, also under the direct command of the kings. When a person causes trouble, the queens will pass the case to the kings, to be passed to the knights. The knights arrest the person and he is sent through conditioning in an effort to bring him back into the fold of society. If this fails, his case will be returned to the kings. When a person is unchangeable, destructive, and is deemed a lost cause, the kings sent the knights to get him (if he's not already in custody). The kings then send the person to the executioners, who kill him. The executioners will be the psychopathic, or those people who enjoy death. There will be only a few executioners. Because society is based on happiness and because the children are intelligently sorted by criteria other than parentage, people can marry whomever they wish. Inter-class marriages are not only acceptable, but celebrated. The classes are not meant to place one person above another, but rather to separate the chain of command. A steel plant director can marry a farm rabble, a judge can marry a knight, a cotton rabble can marry a cotton rabble, it's all fine. Birth limits will be set every five years by the queens based on the population size and requirements, and the limit will be enforced by the kings' knights. Homosexual marriage is permitted, no person shall be forced to wed, and divorce is allowed but heavily frowned upon and discouraged. A well-ordered, well-controlled society is your best bet for a happy society. If everyone gives up a little freedom, everyone gets a little more happiness. No strife, no war, no messy revolutions or famines or shortages. I do recommend setting aside one day every month as Outburst Day. This is kind of like the Purge or the Ten Minutes Hate. The purpose is to let everyone let out a little emotion in a fun and healthy way. For one day, everyone goes to Outburst parks, prepared by a sect, and smashes up junk. Old cars, broken computers, discarded windows, non-reusable bottles, everything that's fun to destroy. People go and trash some stuff, they feel better, they go home, they go on with life. Also, everybody gets two free days in a week. The days differ across the sects and across the troupes- the sect is cotton workers, the division is manufacturing, the job is weaving, the troupe is number 43. They get Wednesday and Thursday. Troupes 50 to 100 might get Monday and Tuesday. Troupes 1 to 50 might get Wednesday and Thursday, and so on. Iron workers, miners, troupes 1 to 25 could have Thursday and Friday. The idea is to avoid giving everyone the same two days off. Keep everything running, let the people rest, don't disrupt the flow. Everybody's happy. Well, that's how I'd make a happy society. I'm sure I'm forgetting something, but that's the base of it. Just keep everybody ordered, in line, equal, happy, and purposeful.
