During the pregnancy spell, the mother can manipulate the genes of their offspring by channeling the energy of the aether through people (or maybe even animals?). This channeling will slowly alter the DNA of the offspring with the genes of the subject being channeled through. This channeling can only be done in close proximity and with deliberate effort. This allows the mother to create amalgams of genes from people she identifies as having valuable genes. This of course can go wrong by combining genes in bad ways. And it can also go well by careful selection to get just the right set of genes. It also allows the possibility of making genetic clones. Channeling through a single individual for the duration of the spell would cause all the genes to be the same as the target individual. 

The effort required to complete a task using magic, is considerably more effort than completing the task without magic. This would make it known, but not useful. It would simply be one more way to complete a task, but not close to the optimal way. People would be sure to try it at some point in their lives, but it simply wouldn't be worth using it in their day-to-day lives. 

Actually the more warlike American Indian tribes were often in a state of low level permanent war with every other tribe except for a few allies. There are many examples of tribe A and Tribe B raiding each other for decades at a time. Research may find examples of permanent war conditions lasting for over a century. And other warrior societies may also have examples of war conditions lasting for decades or centuries. 

If the Caretakers have fusion power, they don't need a specific intensity of sunlight for power production for photosynthesis since they can use electrical powered artificial lighting for plants. But no doubt they will also use a lot of natural sunlight for power production. Waste not, want not. So build space habitats out of materials found in the solar system. Use fusion power for artificial sunlight for the plants. Stock habitats with Earth lifeforms. Each habitat must be large enough for a flourishing ecological zone. It may become a problem building habitats large enough for ocean ecological zones. Enough space habitats can be built that the total volume and surface areas of all the space habitats is many times greater than Earth's biosphere. Stock them with Earth life forms and move Earth life forms from habitat to habit until they have multiplied and filled them all. Move the habitats outside the zone of destruction. Also move a lot of the raw materials from planets, moons, asteroids, etc. from the zone of destruction out to the safe zone. Waste not, want not. Wait though the entire solar red giant phase. Then terraform at least one remaining solar system body if possible and colonize it with some of the lifeforms from the habitats. Put artificial sun satellites powered by fusion in orbit around the terraformed body. Keep maintaining the space habitats with Earth lifeforms as a back up, which should have been started many millions of years before the red giant phase, anyway. 

It's not a safe place. The bosses are secretly studying a way to upload themselves into the machines, and while for religious matters the protagonist won't create an army of himselves, the bosses would. Each boss is provided with a save point in order to study it, with the order to upload himself/herself/itself only if he/she/it has 100% chance to succeed. Bosses, though, are not overconfident, and that's why they put an entire dungeon to protect that point, and why they didn't try that yet. 

Radioactive weaponry If your small guys are smart enough and understand more science that we do, you could basically instant-kill living things with the help of gamma rays! If you shoot a radiation so powerful into anything solid, it will excite their atoms so much, that they will to begin to radiate too (sort of a single projectile, which divides into many fragments like in the first 10 seconds of this video). A high dose of radiation could lead to instant death :) 

Make it biological. A tons of stuff that lives like cells and so on cannot (yet) be seen, scanned or whatsoever. Microscope stuff that you see is often dead and artificially-colored in order to let people actually see it. This would also have the advantage that you could have a very fast-expiring mix (when cells inside are dead, it works no more). 

The method of finding the parallax, and thus the distance, to stars involves observing them from Earth or Earth orbit and plotting their apparent positions half a year apart. The distance Earth travels between two observations will make nearby stars seem to change position very slightly against the back ground of farther stars. The accuracy of observations and distance measurements can be improved by improving the resolution of the instruments and/or by moving the instruments a greater distance between observations than a mere two astronomical units. Or you can use simultaneous observations from widely separated instruments. So by first using widely separated observatories in our own solar system with accurately measured distances between them we can find the distances to nearby stars very accurately. Then instantly transport observatories to some nearby stars at distances about a million times the diameter of the Earth's orbit. Simultaneous observations from those widely spaced observatories will thus be a million times as accurate as observations from Earth six months apart. That will be enough to make a very accurate three dimensional map of the globular star clusters. Then instantly transport observatories to distances thousands of times farther from Earth than those nearby stars. The map of the globular star clusters will enable precise positioning of those observatories billions of times farther apart than the spread of the earth's orbit, and thus capable of measuring parallaxes billions of times more precisely. Observatories thousands of light years "above" and "below" the galactic plane will have views of hundreds of billions of stars in the galaxy, unobstructed by the dust clouds. Observing each star over a period of years will detect angular motion while spectroscopy will reveal how fast it is traveling toward or away from each observatory. Knowledge of how far away each star is from an observatory will indicate how old the positions are and thus where the star has moved to since its light was emitted. And that is the procedure for a preliminary mapping of the galaxy to be followed by more detailed surveys of stellar positions. but you would need really super sized telescopes to detect small objects like moons, asteroids, comets, etc. over hundreds or thousands of light years. Detecting them should be left to surveys of individual solar systems. If space travelers are afraid of running into unseen objects in interstellar space despite the fact that "Space is empty. Very, very, very empty." they might as well stay home and not dare to travel in interstellar space. 

Expansion to new lands would be limited. Wars over resources would be common and abortion would happen regularly. It's likely that small communities, lone rangers, family pioneers, etc. would be non-existent. Essentially, individuals can't be separated from a breeding population. As soon as a woman became pregnant, she would lose her usefulness to men wanting to have sex to stay alive. Since as you say "Effects of males mating with pregnant females is the same as contraception-mating." 

Organic Space Elevator The space faring creature is a large tree. It grows so tall, it extends past the atmosphere. Eventually reaching beyond geostationary orbit. It could shift its mass and pull up its roots to leave the planet below. Once in space, it could steer itself with leaves that act like solar sails. 

It's just not realistic for a human like species to not investigate something like this. Curiosity is, in many ways, a required trait or byproduct of intelligence. It's needed to explore, learn and push the bounds of knowledge. People study and examine everything they can lay their hands on. Another species that shows intelligence (even disregarding what we perceive as supernatural abilities) is just too tempting of a subject for people to leave alone. Of course this would be a divided issue. There would be pro-creatures-rights groups and pro-human groups (advocating for the advancement of the human species through further understanding of these creatures). In today's society I can imagine the popular opinion being for creature-rights, while the behind the scenes story is secret installations filled with creature test subjects. Even the laws and tabooness suggested in other answers would be violated, perhaps not publicly, but it would happen. In the end, humans are just not advanced/peaceful/mature enough as a society to respect the rights of another species. 

but I'd believe normal people wouldn't want to call themselves like semi-gods, nor would they dare to call themselves "the ones who know [insert divinity name here]". TWIST: The "Moirai" could also actually be their enemy, since they'd no more shape human destiny. 

A lot of people believe that a chip cannot be tampered with from a distance. This is not true, especially if you are setting your story in a future where technology has evolved. Assuming your ID must be wirelessly communicated, I assume that the informations (whatever they are) stored in the RFID-like chip are encrypted. The problem with traditional cryptography, though, is that if you have the key(s), you have everything you need to decrypt your code... And the keys are too stored somewhere. Quantum cryptography is said to be impossible to hack due to the fact that a "bit" of information alters its state when it's read (from third parties). Problem is: it alters its state when it's read by a machine too... and if a machine is expecting a certain sequence to launch the missiles, it means that there's too a key involved... Assuming the worst case, terrorists have the key(s). A wireless transmission of a code is really a bad idea, since what the terrorists would do is simply set a smart-antenna to track the chip from a distance, and read its informations. What's indeed difficult is actually to get to the president physically. So why bother with a chip, when a retinal scan (some users already pointed out that this is impossible to hack - and why can't the scan work with sunglasses? They can be "smart" ones, or the scanner can be), voice recognition, fingerprint analysis, password and a titanium bullet with a code inside hidden in the body are all things that need a physical abduction? In short: I wouldn't rely on a (single) code stored on a (single) chip. Especially if transmission is considered. 

Disbelief mostly, otherwise no significant change. A majority of people believe what they want and what makes them comfortable, and people don't like uncomfortable truths. Additionally, the majority of people simply wouldn't understand, making them incapable of believing. There's no single best way to release the information. It depends on the motivation of the people releasing the information. What does the public have to gain by knowing they're in a simulation? How can you "dumb down" this evidence so that anyone can understand it? How can the average person convince themselves it's true? The reaction of the governments is to find a way to control the information. Maintaining control and peace. Likely attempting to exploiting whatever flaw in the system that proves it's a simulation, using those flaws to manipulate events, gather information that would be otherwise unobtainable, etc. If people were willing to accept it, I think the majority would continue on with life as it is. Afterall, a majority of people in the world already believe everything they do, say, or feel is being observed by a big man in the sky. They already believe that this life is just a temporary existence followed by an eternity of one kind or another. New religions would begin worshiping "the creators" or "simulators", whatever it may be. As for the way out, like I said, most people already believe there's a "way out" of this life, and everyone is going to get there eventually anyway. 

As naive I can be, I always assumed people started inventing flying machines in order to "be like the birds". In an earth-like world without any flying/gliding being (animal or plant), what could be the drive for people to glimpse the idea of flying? Assume this is about a "Leonardo da Vinci" inventor, who is planning to create a machine to "go into the sky". What kind of simple observations and thoughts would be sufficient to at least spark this idea? Provided that gravity teaches that "what flies goes back on earth in no time", is it enough? 

Am I the only one here thinking about bioengineering trees so that their wood becomes more weapon-ready? I'm talking about super venomous resins, super elastic / super sturdy materials, exploding wood, or whatever you can think of. 

What about a particular kind of cancer? I'm not a doctor, but it is my understanding that some kinds of cancer happen due to DNA damage. What would happen if the two nations had a problem on vast scale of people having these kinds of illnesses? I think they might try procedures to repair the DNA, and since identical twins have the same DNA, they could lead their trials on twins. Of course, if the phaenomenon is widespread, the governments would have to "use" all the twins possible (since they are rare)... 

Some suggestions: the Inca empire - the word inca means lord. The monarch was the Sapa Inca or "only lord". in the Jack Vance novel the Languages of Pao the monarch of the planet Pao was the Panarch, which was meaningless to me until I separated it into Pan and Arch - all highest. The Greek title of Pantokrator for Jesus Christ - all ruler. Cosmocrator - ruler of the Cosmos. Padishah - Lord king or Master King. Translate from Persian into your language. Note that during the Mughal empire the highest title that the Padishah granted to Hindus - either vassal rulers of regions or landless officials and courtiers - was Maharajadhiraja bahader. Maharajadhiraja means great king of kings, bahader makes a title one step higher. Perhaps in your world people may call their monarch "the King" but when they talk about the monarch of the realm they call him "THE KING". Depending on how pagan Norse or how Christian western European the society is, the people may use titles in both their native languages and in Latin. Just as eastern European medieval rulers used titles in both their native languages and Greek, the language of the "Byzantine" empire. As a matter of fact it is possible to claim to be the rightful ruler of everywhere and also to be a governor. Some Popes claimed to be the rightful rulers of the world, and yet used the title Vicarius Christi "Vicar of Christ", claiming to be the representative or governor on Earth of Jesus Christ. Similarly the Roman emperors are considered to be (almost) absolute monarchs, and yet the title of emperor is derived from the Latin word Imperator, which has many shades of meaning. Imperator is connected with Jupiter, the main Roman god, according to some sources, and thus makes someone sort of Jupiter like. Imperium was power and authority in general, and the military, political, and judicial power of Roman magistrates who were granted imperium in particular. So imperator might be a generic term for magistrates and promagistrates who were granted imperium to rule over their province. In the later Roman republic victorious generals - who would be magistrates and promagistrates and thus be granted imperium during their terms of office, would be hailed as imperator by their troops, thus becoming more or less entitled to a triumph at Rome. A Magistrate's imperium was limited in time by his term of office, and in space by the border of his province. Augustus the first emperor was granted the power of imperium proconsulare maius "greater proconsular authority" or imperium proconsulare maius et infinitum "greater and infinite proconsular authority". This made him superior in authority to proconsuls governing senatorial provinces as well as governor of most of the provinces - the imperial provinces. In most provinces the Emperor was the governor and the highest authority in such a province would be the Emperor's legate acting in the Emperor's name. Thus the Roman Emperor was sort of the governor of everywhere, and his imperium or governorship was not limited to a single province but included all the provinces. And don't forget that a true emperor claims to be the rightful ruler of everywhere. And in real life we know the universe is incredibly vast. Suppose that every solar system is ruled by a someone with the comparatively lowly title of King. A ruler of 10 solar systems might be a king to the second power, or a king of kings. The ruler of 100 solar systems might be a king of kings of kings or a king to the third power. The ruler of our galaxy might be a king to the eleventh power. The ruler or emperor of the whole universe would be at least a king to the twenty first power. And of course the physical universe might be gazillions of times larger than the known universe. So don't be afraid to have a ruler with kings of kings and kings of kings of kings among his vassals, or who claims to be infinitely higher than a mere king. I kind of like the idea of people addressing a powerful leader as "Master of All". Of course that is a form of address and not a title. After the assassinated Julius Caesar was defied, declared a god, his adoptive son Octavius, the future first emperor Augustus, used "son of the divine Caesar" as part of his name, to great political advantage. Caesar had been decreed Dictator for Life, or actually Perpetual Dictator, shortly before being assassinated. I can imagine that some ambitious Roman might have claimed that since Caesar was the Perpetual Dictator his appointment was still valid and the spirit of the Divine Caesar was giving the government orders though the ambitious Roman. Thus someone might try to become ruler of Rome while claiming to be the mere mouthpiece or vicar of Caesar. 

I can actually think of many ways for them to "enjoy" wars, but in the long term, since they are immortal, they'd learn that wars achieve nothing. Let me explain: if they know they are all immortal, they will probably focus on a guerrilla with ambushes and imprisonment rather than anything else. Maybe kidnapping and maybe sabotage (but hey, even if they are greedy, they can anyway live without crops, right?). So after a couple generations the war will reach a standstill, where factions simply don't go in some territories (fear of being taken by the other faction and spend the eternity inside a volcano?). Eventually their arrogance and ignorance (they are human-like, right?) will make some people think that they could instead reign, so I would focus more on "secret" civil wars, kidnappings and tortures rather than a proper war. 

What about "Thanatógon(s)" and "Biógon(s)"? Those come from death = Thánatos (θάνατος) / life = Bíos (βίος) + the word "puppetteer", which is translated into "Góns" (γόης). I strongly disagree with people using "Nekros" as "Death", since it actually means "Dead" (a person who is deceased). The divinities they devote to could indeed be the "Moirai":
