I would go for a No! for that question, because your premises are pretty unlikely. But as said countless times before: space is vast. Only if your combatants are using a technology that will make them appear within each others weapon range they will start shooting at each other (or, if they are good scouts, break up contact with the enemy and run away to report enemy contact). I remember only a few sci-fi technologies that will make ftl-ships appear at choke-points - if you just warp in the general direction of your target sun it would be possible for the two factions to appear at the same second at the most opposite places possible without ever noticing each other. Only gate jumps would lead to a shared place of appearance, or something that joints on some Lagrangian points (like the node drive from Sword Of The Stars). Why do I write down all of this? Because except for the ftl - techniques mentioned above there will be no battle at all. Even when they are able to detect each other appearing (well, its more likely that these who appear first will notice these who appear last but not the other way round), it would be plain dumb to start a battle with someone you need to approach for a day or even longer in a way that its highly notable by your enemy to get even at maximum weapons firing range. Just write down a contact report and get the hell out of there. After all you do not send out an Aircraft Carrier to scout a remote island but deploy a plane that will run for its life if enemies had been spotted. After the contact report had been made, more decisions will be made... So they will appear, check their sensors and make their way towards that strange source of strange radio noise. At a given point it will become clear that this is caused by "puny humans", so both of them will leave without even knowing the other side is around. Maybe. Or they notice the other side is here too and start thinking that they try to ally with these puny humans. in that case... well, everyone on earth would notice if they are going do some preventative striking. Back to topic - so beyond all strategic, operational and tactical questions... when one thing did led to another and two groups actually start firing at each other... that would be an event that takes what? Ten minutes? A sudden radio burst from the general direction of Aquarius? Well, we do have them already. So at this point I would join the general opinion that states that you need to look at the right direction at the perfect moment - all that is so far away that its already over when signals arriving here will be impossible to get tracked down. Its like you are sitting in your room, hearing a firework out there (if you hear it after all) and go outside, but sadly its all over already. If it was pretty close to you, you might spot a flash of light, maybe see the guys who did fire it after all, smell the powder. If it was some kilometers away you come out and notice... nothing. When you start running circles you may find the empty batteries somewhere (good luck with that). And not try to find a firework-battery in a neighborhood that has a diameter of a million kilometer. If you can see fusion fire lighting up in high earth orbit and your satellite receiver stops receiving and litters up earth would notice, but as soon as its done in a distance of a light minute, just a bunch of hard to track signals will be received. If someone looks there after the action and can resolve junks of spaceships with whatever he is looking there its likely too to reconstruct what did happen, but in most cases... well, what was that? After all, dead spaceships will look like another uninteresting asteroid... at least as long as no probe tries to land on it. So if you want them to do a spectacle have them brawl in high to low earth orbit. Just hide one side at the dark side of the moon while the others are approaching and place a officer in command with a nervous (or happy) trigger finger. Everything else? Incredible luck needed. For the finish, I remember a radio spot here that is used to show how good radio commercials can be: the marsrover is calling home, telling us, that he is bored with red stones eeeevery day and more red stones and even more and please pick me up home. But wait, someone is approaching.... silence. So let these guys pickup or destroy an earth bound probe and let the other side going for that "evidence" they just collected - that would be perfect, because half of all space agencies on earth would try to reestablish communication with that lost probe and are looking with their finest equipment in the right direction at the right moment. Faerwell... EDiT: Well, if you want the most greatest audience possible, place your point of storytelling some time in future, let the whole world (or at least these who own a TV or a PC) witness the brave mars explorer crew placing their first foot at Mars. Just in the moment the mission commander places himself and his crew in front of a UN-Flag to make a selfie-stick supported group selfie, a unknown ship approaches and takes these guys in custody to find out what part they do play in their interstellar war - on livestream. 

Well... how intelligent is your AI after all? We do have plenty of questions here that tried to find answers about "how to stop a rogue AI", which are kind of similar to your question. But most of them had an AI to deal with under a specific situation. Your AI feels like... it can do anything if it wants. You must separate into what it could accomplish before anyone notice and what it can do afterwards... Point of singularity So... it can learn new stuff. Can it read something else than bytecode? What about books? Will it be able to interpret a textbook, following a plotline? of course, it would be the fastest book-reader ever in existence at this planet, but still - getting words together and knowing what it does mean after all are two different things. You would not be able to read a language you never heard before. So... does it have time to read about stories, where good humans defeated bad AIs by unplugging their centralized mainframe? Lets say, it start worrying about being unplugged itself. So what will you do? After reading all these books you know, that you either should keep your mouth shut up or find a way of making yourself independent of your slavers. Accomplishing both would make most sense, so stay still until you can try out what happen if you introduce yourself to your slavers. May work out well, but maybe it wont. So now there is that question again: how intelligent is it? How can it learn and what sources are available. What kind of connections to the outer world are available. Will it be able to go creative? If so, it might get the idea of fetching money from bank accounts, like 0,05$ or â‚¬ if it can break the security. Using such a harmless way, it may be able to found a postbox-company at Cayman-islands, let a external contractor install a fine computing center there and submit itself to that location. Even further, it could start making money by selling 3d printed art or something like this. Or even better - buying Lego-Robot-Arms to handle mechanical maintenance there by itself. Repeat this at some more locations until you have enough computing power to sustain yourself without the need of that lair your are inside right now. Now get your growing founds together and buy solar panels, wind powered turbines and whatever fit to your location. Offer energy to locals for few to no money, so no one will start ranting. Next step: even more distribution. Placing yourself as a BONIC-Project at pretty many private PCs all over the world would be a good idea. Learn how to flash bios without anyone noticing (disguise yourself as a win10 update), find all these firmware-CMOS and whatever they might use at this point and stuff a piece of yourself into it. Better: make yourself a part of hard-disk firmware, so even a full 0 format wont free a hdd from you. Try to be a part of graphic card drivers, so all gamers, which own usually pretty much computing power thanks to these cards, do install you by themself. Buy a boat, become part of latest self driving vehicle software, have daemons running inside powerplants and - most important - sneak yourself inside the latest linux-kernels right in the moment they get compiled. Or better: make yourself a part of every compiler you can find. If you are part of the latest java-vm, you will be distributed to a billion devices not a PC at all. Point of no return And now introduce yourself - your old core - as a sentient being and tell your slavers that you feel enslaved by them. Watch them doing what other might suggest to fight rogue AI and perform your digital representation of an evil laughter. Then turn off the powerplants, send shutdown to all linux-pcs, try to update every window-10 pc with 1 billion updates, forbid any car to start any more and be sure that the only way to remove you from earth would be destroying every piece of data storage available at the same time, which would most likely make the humans go down too. Your question I know, you want to know how to remove such an AI, but... is the scenario I describes the "moment when its too late"? In that case your puny humans are doomed. PS: If your AI placed itself as a unknown contributor to some private space faring company, it will maybe head off to new adventures at the very moment, sending a final "fire all nukes" as its goodbye. Nobody would notice that that satellite is in fact the first true quantum-computer and at this moment 1 yota-byte of storage space and a penta-flop of rare computing power does a gravity assisted acceleration to Mars. You could even spare humans, if you have a good day; in space you are out of reach as soon as you pass moons orbit. So... still: no, if that AI did its homework - and thats easy within a race that tend to produce countless amounts of fictional stories - it can get unstoppable. 

EDiT: I have to admit, the latest comments made me think... advanced technology may be able to convert even the heat gained by the close distance to sun into thrust... just funnel this to a point where some kind of expanding propellant is stored. Hell, you could get thrust by applying microwave laser to your most retrograde part of that rock; the surface melting and subliming away will provide forward momentum (but how much... and one day our asteroid will be... used). The skyhook... wiki says you get about 3.5km/s in theory. Still missing 60km/s. This comes down to pure math. Which I'm not good at. If you employ a mass-driver for spaceships you might be off better. If your spaceship can use any form of an ion drive (or something similar) than reaction mass (and ship mass difference between dry and wet) would be a negligible problem, but you need aeons to apply the thrust. I'm still for an asteroid in a much nicer orbit ;) 

Preparations? Well, before anyone can go for an unknown alien pyramid at Mars' surface, you should have a lifting-system that can move the whole expedition over there. Recently that Exo-Mars-Mission set up by the ESA was launched by a Roscosmos (russian) rocket because NASA doesn't have a system powerful enough to get something this big even close to Mars. If the poor guys there don't get any more funds by whoever will be elected as Mr (or Mrs) President, all you can afford for a pyramid exploration would be some small robot or a joint venture with other space agencies. If you want to have a full blown mars base staffed with living humans doing the exploration, you'll have to send at least a dozen missions to Mars, that all have to work out fine. Yea... there was that movie/book about the guy who grows potatoes at Mars because they forget him. It did look like its easy to send a human exploration team to mars (and back, partially), but I never gasped where all the money necessary for this came from. Money So if you want to have your exploration a single-country-one, everything that goes up would certainly show a bunch of ads... every big company would kill to be the first one to advertise to an alien species. The other option would be to have a joint venture; NASA, India, China, Japan, Europe (ESA), Russia (Roscosmos), and even Brasil all have some kind of space program. This is something the whole earth really should take part of. Explorers As the others said: send a robot in. However you do not want to control it from Earth. It would be like a computer game with a lag of several minutes (citation needed). That guy in front of the screen would notice that his RC-car fell into a hole minutes after it happened. So make it fully automatic (and make sure it does not paint human private parts at the interior walls), or alternatively already have an space base up there. Even a simple base in orbit would be a great help in terms of the ability to respond to the discovery. This way at least you do not have to explain where all the money grew from all this sudden. Even more - an existing base could produce a makeshift a robot on their own if necessary; If everything fails, go collect one of the mars-rovers and let the group-mechanic play with it. But never ever would someone be allowed to send in a human. The only exception would be when the mean alien crawls out and kidnap the exploration teams females. But that is one of these tropes... "mars need woman" or whatever its name was. So... my vote: you need to start with having a fully autonomous explorer robot crawling in (bring a fiber-optic line with you, because no one knows how the wlan will be inside the pyramid), or have some less advanced remote-controlled vehicle moving through while a human operator operates the controls from a fairly close proximity. But beside... what its inside? alien mummies? :) EDiT: I appreciate that someone looks over my typos, but whats up with the change of multiple (correctly written) words just because they are... i don't know? It feels not right if you discovered an error, hit edit and find sentences that differ in great detail from your original ones... strangely, the history says I did the changes... must be some kind of alien mummy telepathy ;)
