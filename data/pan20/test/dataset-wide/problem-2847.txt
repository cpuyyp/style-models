If we get one contradiction such as I got here with 8 and 9, how are we certain that this makes the argument valid? Don't we need to check if A, C, and D also contradict? 

I came across a validation method for testing the validity of a syllogistic argument which seems quite easier to grasp: For example: To test the argument: 

1.) Star premise letters that are distributed and conclusion letters that aren't distributed. 2.) Then the syllogism is VALID if and only if every capital letter is starred exactly once and there is exactly one star on the right-hand side. It becomes: 

Another motive force is his fear from superstition, to which reason and philosophy are the best antidotes. Even a mistaken philosophy is safer than superstition. 

Yes, there is the framework which is known as two dimensional semantics, a concept first developed by Robert Stalnaker in the 1970s. The related two modal dimensions are not modal in the same sense. According to a common interpretation (following the terminology of Saul Kripke in Naming and Necessity), one modal dimension is considered "metaphysical", subject-independent possible worlds, while the other modal dimension is considered "epistemic", subject-centered possible worlds. A classical example is "water is H2O". It is said to be epistemically contingent (our watery substance might not have been H2O), yet metaphysically necessary (once we discovered that our watery substance is H2O, it has become the very definition of water (for us)). Here, from the preface of Laura Schroeter's SEP article on two-dimensional semantics: 

And the rule is that if we have a contradiction, our proof is done. Is there any way to check this if it is valid or not? 

Now, we can say that the argument is valid because it meets the requirements for it to be valid but I don't exactly understand what is the proof behind this star test method. Such as where does the validation ideas come from and what is the answer to: Why or what makes it valid when there is exactly one star on the right hand side? Why or what makes it valid when a capital letter is starred exactly once? 

The assumption "If it does not resemble the past, then all predictions about the future are equally reasonable" seems shaky. Consider the following alternative, which may be termed reverse induction. 

Kant associated synthetic apriori statements (e.g. "every change has a cause") with conditions of possible experience, because this is the only explanation that he found, of what makes these synthetic statements true and apriori. The situation is different with analytic statements, e.g. "this body is extended in space". For analytic statements, we have a ready explanation of what makes them true and apriori: an analytic statement expresses a connection of meanings. As Kant put it, in an analytic statement the predicate is contained in the subject. This makes the analytic statement apriori true, and nothing more is required. So since we already know what makes analytic statements true and apriori, there is no motive to associate them with the conditions of possible experience, or with any other extrinsic truth makers. (P.s. Kant did not define synthetic a priori statements to be about conditions of possible experience. That conditions of possible experience are synthetic a priori, according to Kant, is proved by an argument. It is not true by definition.) 

Why can't we draw our conclusion as here since means at least one is false? I'm not clear with what it means by at least one false because we can only attach with either P or Q so not both are true. I'd like the reason to be explained with an example with truth table just to be clear. 

I think we have it so far so good up to this point, but why can't we have the other way? For example: 

In the first form, The second premise doesn't necessarily mean that John shot James. He may just had a gun for some other reason. You can see this by translating this argument as: Suppose, S = John shot James; G = John had a gun. The first form of argument is incorrect because you cannot draw any conclusion. 1. S ⊃ G 2. G ∴ No conclusion. The second form of argument is correct. 1. S ⊃ G 2. S ∴ G {from 1 and 2; Using modus ponens} 

I was considering a solution to the omnipotence paradox in which excluding logical impossibilities from the definition of omnipotence is justified as follows. Consider the proposition, "God could create a round triangle" (add additional qualifiers, here and to the solution, if you feel there is not a true contradiction). If we don't want to say such a statement is true, which most theists do not, we must ask why it's not true. It seems the proposition can be divided into in three parts: 1) If X exists, it is round 2) If X exists, it is a triangle 3) God could cause X to exist. The proposition can be sensibly said not to affect the definition of omnipotence because it is the conjunction of 1 and 2 that cannot be true. A round triangle is not a "thing." The problem has nothing to do with the truth value of 3. Perhaps we could paraphrase by saying it's not the instantiation of a round triangle that causes the problem, but the mere concept of a round triangle. What I'm curious about is whether such a solution to omnipotence paradoxes carries any weight at all on Meinongian views. Would a round triangle, a married bachelor, or a stone too heavy for God to move exist in Meinong's Jungle? If so, is there any reason such things could not "exist in the world," so to speak, aside from God's inability to instantiate them? 

picture the state of affairs where the cat is on the mat? What is the common structure between the sentence and the SOA? Well, it seems to be something like: 

How can an element change it itself, just by being, or nor being, a part of some set? This borders on self contradiction. You are here on the verge of a set-theorical paradox, perhaps something similar to Russell's paradox... So it seems that rephrasing Anselm's argument in term of "universes" adds to the argument more (and unnecessary) problems than it had to begin with. 

A category is a class. The term "category" implies classification. We classify a topic into classes. We categorize a subject into categories. In Western philosophy, the term 'categories' pertains usually to general metaphysics, that is ontology. An ontologist categorizes the kinds of being, such as: substance, quality, quantity, relation, fact, etc. The origin is apparently in Aristotle, who laid out his ontology in the Categories and later developed it in the Physics and in the Metaphysics. Many later philosophers discussed the list of categories. The special thing about Kant was that his list of categories was not derived from purely metaphysical considerations, but largely from subjective i.e. epistemological and psychological considerations. Hegel continued this tendency. In Hegel's philosophy the very distinctions betweem subjective, objective and absolute become blurred by a to and fro "dialectic" movement of derivation. And while Kant's list contained 12 categories, Hegel's list stretched to about 270 categories.
