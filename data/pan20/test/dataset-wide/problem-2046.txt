That kind of work ethic is not encouraged because it is not the most effective for the organization. Your friend needs to learn to work with others, to deal with the people he doesn't like and to stop thinking he is so much better than everyone else that he doesn't have to play the game. Why would he want to handicap himself to small one-person projects when the big projects are often far more challenging and interesting? Why would he want to stay at a junior person's salarly (Senior people have to be able to work with others) for the rest of his life? Team work is simply a requirement most places and it should be. He needs to fix his problem and then he will know what to say in interviews. 

This is also to prevent people from using something inappropriate as part of their signature like religious or political quotes. Since emails from the company represent the company, they don't want personal stuff in it that the company may not want to be associated with. 

The people who I have seen move up to management from a lower rung tend to have some things in common. They take initiative. They volunteer for new opportunities particularly those that will have senior management attention, they learn to sell ideas for change and then successfully shepherd them through. It can also help to move around through different parts of the business and be familiar with more than one tiny technical specialty. Also make sure to support the business needs and make sure that your own boss is happy with you and make sure you get credit for the things you do. (Snakes take credit for things other people do, but you don't have to be a political snake to succeed.) Management is about 80-90% politics. Workplace politics are not so different than the politics it takes to get a bill through Congress. It is very much about developing allies and trading favors. When looking to hire people to move up to management, they want to know that you understand this and can handle the political end. Otherwise, you may get to first line supervision but not beyond it. As someone with a political science degree, you are better equipped than most to handle this side of things. My Political science degree was extremely valuable to me in learning to navigate office politics and to sell my vision to higher ups. Go back and re-read Machiavelli as you are going to have to deal with the "end justifies the means" snakes successfully to get ahead. Knowing what their moves are puts you way ahead of the game. I would change your timeline for this as well. 5 years to the first management position is a good thing, 10 is not bad, 20 generally means you have gotten too old to be considered. If you want to get past the first two levels of management, an MBA is going to come in handy. 

Lots of things to consider here. First, use your professional network of fellow women in engineering and ask them how well their company/boss treats them before you apply anywhere. This should get you a list of better companies to work for. If you don't have such a network, now is the time to develop one. Conferences and user groups are a good place to meet other women in Technology. The SQL PASS organization, for instance, has a Women in Technology group that you can become active with. You can connect with the men in your network too, but honestly if the harassment didn't affect them, they may not have noticed it. While I might not ask directly during the interview, you can look for clues. First how are any other women especially receptionists, secretaries, HR personnel treated by the men you see them come into contact with? If these people are not treated professionally, women engineers likely will not be treated well either. If there are no other women around, that is usually a bad sign too. If you can, get a tour of the office space and look at how people interact with each other and what the spaces look like. Does it seem like a place with a lot of juvenile joking going on? Then pass. Unless you enjoy toilet humor. Are there obnoxious pictures or perhaps a copy of the screed from that Google engineer on women posted on the walls or bulletin boards? Do people make jokes about you being a EEO or Affirmative Action hire? Is the tone of voice they use when talking to you dismissive? Is there anyone who gives you a creepy vibe when you walk by or are introduced? Pay special attention to this as it only takes one creep to ruin a perfectly good workplace. Check out how people look at you when you are there. See if anyone mistakes you for the secretary or unabashedly stares at your boobs. As you walk around the spaces in a tour, see how other people (male and female) are treated as well. Is there a difference in how women are spoken to compared to the men. If you get complimented is it for something you have accomplished or for your looks? Do they make a big deal out of being a merit-based organization? This is sometimes a code phrase for "only white men are promoted here" in my experience. They manipulate this by making sure the people they want to hire/promote get the choice tasks and everyone else does not, so they look like the "right" folks accomplished more at the end of the year in the "Objective" measures. There are some good places that claim this too, but check out the organizational structure. If all the people of color and women are in the lower ranks and none of them have been promoted to a management position, your career will be dead at that place. And you will very likely get sexually harassed. Does the interview seem too simple for the skill level of the position? This is often a sign that they are only interested because you are female (especially if you are young and attractive). Does the interviewer seem dismissive of you and your skills? Do they bring up how women do in their workplace? Having a company culture that celebrates diversity and is willing to talk about it up front is a starting place. Not a deal breaker if they don't bring it up though. Conversely, if they are all excited about possibly hiring their first babe, you may want to pass. Places that haven't had to worry about harassment before often don't deal with it well. If they refer to you as a girl, pass. You are an adult woman not a girl. They rarely take you seriously if you are a girl to them. Check out the Internet for stories about the company. 

Let me tell you a story about the bad old days of the 1980s when sexual harrassment was common in the workplace. At the time I worked for the military as a civil service worker, but the command I worked for had very many more men than women and they tended to use profanity extensively. I didn't particularly care and said nothing. Another woman complained loudly to the boss including a list of what words were said and how many times they were said (and by who) over a period of time. A third woman, who was very conservative and religious and actaully much more offended than the other woman, talked to the offenders privately and asked then not to use the language in front of her. These were the same guys working on the same team. With the woman who complained directly to the boss with the numeric counts, they made sure to find a way to improve their score (by making it go up!) for the next complaint. They also did some very nasty things to the woman. But for the woman who directly and politely asked them to refrain in front of her, they tried to be aware of what they were saying and be mindful of how much it bothered her. The point is that most people don't want to be offensive to you and will try to not be offensive if you simply tell them that the behavior bothers you. They will however up the ante if you make them mad in how you go about complaining. So the first rule is never go above someone's head on an issue until you have calmly tried to work it out with them. If you make them aware there is a problem and they continue, then you have to decide if it offends you enough to constitute a problem and then either go to HR and discuss the issue or look for a different team to work on or find a new job. If they escalate the behavior, then you probably do want to definitely go to HR or change jobs because life is too short to spend it working with jerks. It is a bit more delicate because the person who is being offensive is your boss. but honestly if he doesn't care about offending you and gets mad if you say something, do you really want to work for him? You really need to weigh the level of offense against your desire to keep this job against the difficulty of finding a new one in your field (most people will allow more offensive behavior when it is hard to find another job because we like to keep a roof over our heads.) Depending on the person's personality, a joke might work but that is too subtle for many people and may be seen by them as encouraging the behavior. It worked for me once when someone crossed the line, but it was someone I knew pretty well and I knew he would both get my point and not get upset that I pushed back publicly with a joke that embarrassed him as much as he had embarrassed me with what he said. But I wouldn't try it unless I knew the person well enough to predict the reaction and only if I was pretty confident in my personal ability to read people. Since you are asking this question, I would suspect this might not be the technique for you.
