To say the "speed of light" is (mostly) about light is a common misunderstanding of that speed. It's actually the speed of causality, and it has far more implications that merely how fast photons propagate. It is also the conversion factor from mass to energy. (E = mc^2) When space expands the photons within it don't suddenly go faster to cover the expansion. Think of it this way. Let's say you have a beetle crawling across a rubber sheet and you stretch that rubber sheet to double its original size. Does the beetle suddenly start crawling twice as fast? No, the beetle still plods along at its same speed. Just like light crossing the universe. The universe expands and light has to take more time. 

The outer layers of the star will fall onto the white dwarf, forming an accretion disk as the star stuff spirals in. Like this image shows. 

Assuming you mean the Cosmic Microwave Background ... The CMB is entirely in a very narrow range of the microwave part of the spectrum. Galaxy emissions are all over the spectrum. The CMB comes uniformly from all over the sky. It's like looking at painting that is all one color. Galaxy light looks like pinpoints on a dark background. (Nearby galaxies are not pinpoints, but those at cosmological distances look that way.) The CMB matches the exact wavelength we expect for light that is heavily redshifted from the moment of last scattering. That moment was hundreds of millions of years before galaxies ever formed. Light from oldest galaxies are at a redshifted wavelength from 500 million years after the last scattering. If the CMB was due to early starlight reflecting off dark objects, you would see a very different spectrum. It would contain many absorption lines as the dark objects absorbed some wavelengths better than others. Also the reflected starlight would be across a wide range of frequencies, unlike the CMB which has a very narrow range. 

Titan is roughly ten times more massive than Pluto or Eris, the most massive known Kuiper Belt objects (KBOs). (Titan is in fact more massive than any other moon in the Solar System except Ganymede.) It would be a rather strange coincidence if the object that was by far the most massive of the KBOs was in orbit around Saturn, well interior to the Kuiper Belt. Titan's orbit is prograde (it orbits in the same direction that Saturn rotates) and barely tilted with respect to Saturn's equator (less than half a degree), the rings, and most of the other moons. That strongly suggests it formed out of an accretion disk around Saturn, as the Galilean moons formed around Jupiter. Titan also has an extremely dense atmosphere, unlike any of the KBOs. So it's rather unlikely that Titan is a captured KBO. (Neptun's moon Triton, by the way, is thought to be a captured KBO. But it is only slightly more massive than Eris or Pluto, and it has a peculiar retrograde orbit that is very difficult to explain if it formed around Neptune, but easier to explain if it was captured. And since Neptune is the furthest out of the (known) major planets, it's not that surprising that it could have captured a KBO.) 

Our best guess is that if Venus had an ocean, it did 4 billion years ago. Then it had the runaway greenhouse effect due to its thick atmosphere. The runaway greenhouse effect would have boiled away the oceans if the planet ever had oceans. There are several guesses about why its surface is so young (300 million to 600 million years old). One is that the planet get so hot the entire surface melts. It has no plate tectonics and it has a super thick atmosphere to trap the heat. All that heat melts the surface every half billion years or so. Another reason is that it has many very large volcanoes. (167 volcanoes over 100 km across.) That's far more very large volcanoes than Earth has. Those volcanoes resurface the planet and keep it young. 

There is some evidence that Population III stars formed as early as 200 million years after the Big Bang. The oldest known star, the Methuselah Star, dates back to 200 million years after the Big Bang. It is a second generation star (judging from its metal content), so that means a generation of very large stars must have lived and died before this one was born. 

The conceptual problem is that the half-light radius is the radius of a circle enclosing half the total light, assuming that the object is circular with a radial intensity profile equal to the Sersic function. So you need to integrate over circular rings, each of which has an area of $2 \pi r \, dr$ and an intensity (or surface brightness) of $S(r)$: $$L(< R) = \int_{0}^{R} 2 \pi r \, S(r) \, dr$$ where $S(r)$ is the Sersic function evaluated at radius $r$. Instead, you're just doing the integral of a line of fixed width: $$\int_{0}^{R} S(r) \, dr$$ In Python terms, the (pre-calculated) function you integrate should be 

I think your best bet would be detecting neutrinos generated by nuclear burning inside the star (as we do for the Sun). Once the star hits the carbon-burning stage, it's actually putting out more energy in neutrinos than in photons. During the silicon-burning phase, which lasts for a few days and is what creates the degenerate iron core (that collapses once it is massive enough), the neutrino flux increases to about 1047 erg/s a few seconds before core collapse. (The peak flux during core collapse is about 1052 to 1053 erg/s). This paper by Asakura et al. estimates that the Japanese KamLAND detector could detect the pre-supernova neutrino flux for stars at distances of several hundred parsecs, and provide advance warning of a core-collapse supernova several hours or even days in advance. Since your characters are in the same system as the star, they'd hardly need a large underground detector to pick up the neutrinos. This plot shows an example of neutrino luminosity (for anti-electron neutrinos) versus time for a pre-supernova star (from Asakura et al. 2016, based on Odrzywolek & Heger 2010 and Nakazato et al. 2013); core collapse begins at t = 0s. 

Are you willing to include all of astronomy, including the basics of mapping the positions and movements of astronomical features? If so, then astronomy has been the theoretical and practical underpinning of basically all timekeeping and navigation, for all of human history, and every other technology or practice that depends on them. You can't get more practical than "when do I plant the crops" or "which direction do I sail to get to my destination," both of which have life-and-death consequences. 

If you buy into General Relativity (you need to throw out an awful lot of modern physics if you don't), gravity is a manifestation of the shape of spacetime around massive objects. It's not that they are being "pulled," but rather that they are just following the straightest path through spacetime that they can. Neutrinos would be the same as any other particles in that respect, and following anything other than this path would require some extraordinary gymnastics and external forces. 

If you fail to reach escape velocity from the earth, you won't break free of its gravitational well, in other words, you will keep orbiting the center of mass of the earth. If the path of your orbit intersects the surface of the earth, then you will, you know, crash. If you fail to reach escape velocity for the galaxy, you'll keep orbiting the center of mass of the galaxy, just like the other couple hundred billions of stars in the galaxy. The galaxy has no hard surface to crash into, so you'll keep orbiting until you come close enough to another orbiting body to perturb your orbit (which could, in the right circumstances, leave you with escape velocity and kick you out of the galaxy. 

When the white dwarf steals enough material to get bigger than 1.4 solar masses, the dwarf will become a Type Ia supernova. This is probably why we never (rarely?) see Thorne–Żytkow objects made from a white dwarf instead. If the white dwarf actually collides with its companion star before it explodes as a supernova, I could imagine it would fall into the center as the stellar material drags down the orbit of the white dwarf. Maybe then it will form something like a Thorne–Żytkow object. Or maybe it will accumulate enough material as it falls in to create a neutron star, at which point it blows itself apart in Type II supernova. 

@Knu8 was right that adding mass to a gas giant will turn it into a star long before the gas giant could become a white dwarf or neutron star. But that works if you add fusionable material such as hydrogen. If you add something that can't fuse into a heavier element, such as Iron or Tin, the matter just keeps accreting onto the gas giant until the planet collapses under its own weight until electron-degeneracy pressure holds it up. That's when it becomes a white dwarf. Thanks @Knu8 for the right answer. I gave you an upvote for that. I posted a separate answer to describe what happens if you add heavier elements. 

That should give you a list of galaxy clusters within the specified radius of your galaxy which are at a similar redshift. Note that the same cluster may come up multiple times under different names (i.e., from different cluster catalogs), but it should be clear from the coordinates and the redshifts which are the same clusters. Now the question is whether your galaxy is plausibly a member of a given candidate cluster or not. Ideally you should find some measurement of each cluster's velocity dispersion $\sigma$; if the galaxy's redshift isn't within $\pm 3 \sigma$ of the cluster's redshift $V_{\rm cluster}$, then you can ignore that cluster, since it's very unlikely that a galaxy with that relative velocity with respect to the cluster is actually gravitationally bound to the cluster. You can't really do better than a probabilistic assessment: roughly how likely it is that the galaxy is a member of a given cluster. Galaxies which are members of a cluster are more likely to be close to the center (on the sky); member galaxies closer to the center can have a higher range of relative velocities, while member galaxies further away should have velocities closer to the cluster redshift. A quick example: Is NGC 4889 ($V_{\rm gal} = 6495$ km/s) a member of a cluster? At its redshift, 1 Mpc = 33 arc minutes; if we search on NED for galaxy clusters within 33 arcmin of NGC 4889 with redshift limits of 4500-8500 km/s, we get 6 results, 4 of which are just the Coma Cluster in different catalogs, with $V_{\rm cluster} \sim 6900$ km/s. Since the various distances ("Separ. arcmin") translate to $\sim$ 100-300 kpc from the cluster center, and since the Coma cluster has a velocity dispersion of $\sim$ 1000 km/s and the difference between NGC 4889 and the cluster is only $\sim$ 400 km/s, it's a very good bet that this galaxy is a member of the Coma Cluster. (It's actually one of the two cD galaxies in the cluster center.) 

The term for when the sun is at its highest is "solar noon". $URL$ It is the moment the sun crosses the meridian. The meridian is an imaginary half-circle that goes from the northernmost point on the horizon to the highest point directly above you and then to the southernmost point on the horizon. The sun is always at its highest point in its daily path when it crosses the merdian. You're right that in earlier centuries, each town would set its clocks at noon for when the sun was at its highest point. Those of us who are familiar with astronomy and history would call that type of timekeeping "apparent solar time". You can't guarantee an exact 24 hour day with "apparent solar time", so some people used "mean solar time" instead. (Historical note: Having each town choose its local noon became a nightmare for railway companies that wanted to set train schedules. So the railway companies urged the creation of 4 time zones in America and encouraged each small town to use "standard time" instead of "apparent solar time". And as rgettman already mentioned, the term for the sun's height above the horizon is "altitude". Astronomers use the term "elevation" for a person's distance above sea level. 

File formats tend to be industry/field-specific, with the format, tools, and expectations of the field coevolving to become more dependent on each other over time. JPEG co-evolved with amateur digital photography, PNG co-evolved with the web. Likewise, FITS co-evolved with astronomical data processing, and so is naturally more suited for that purpose than formats that had entirely different goals and communities involved in their development. (Pedantic nit: JPEG is the name of the compression method and the group that designed it. The file format is technically "JFIF", but everybody colloquially calls it JPEG.) As an image format, FITS has a number of desirable qualities that are lacking in JFIF and PNG, that are crucial for scientific data: 

Also, the use of FITS for astronomy predates the existence of both JPEG/JFIF and PNG -- FITS was standardized in 1981, JPEG in 1992, PNG in 1996. So even if those formats were suitable (which they are not), by the time they were invented there was already widespread use and existence of astronomical image processing tools that were geared to FITS files (and growing archives of astronomical data in FITS format), so it would have been a major effort to switch formats that would never be undertaken unless a new format not only met but exceeded all the prior requirements of the field.
