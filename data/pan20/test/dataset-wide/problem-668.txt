Am I looking at the right thing? The little line running across the seat tube about 1cm above the bottom bracket? It's hard to say, but personally I'm not sure that's a crack at all. It looks more like a scratch. I say that because: a) it looks shallow, and b) that is a really, really weird place for a crack to occur. There are four types of stress (if I remember my solid mechanics correctly) that could cause a frame to crack: shear (picture gripping a pipe with your hands next to each other and pushing with one and pulling with the other), bending, torsion, or tension. Compression wouldn't lead to a crack. There's basically no way that you could apply enough shear force, bending force, or torsional force at that location on the frame to crack it (even a fatigue crack over time), so we'll discount those (plus, you'd expect to see other deformation from bending). That leaves tension. It is totally possible to apply a huge tensile load to a seat tube, for instance by coming down on the pedals really hard after a drop. However, I would imagine that 999 times out of 1,000 it would fail at the welds, not in the middle of the tube like that. I'm not saying you should buy the frame, but it might be worth asking the guy for more info. 

I mean, put enough Stans in to the wheels, and you can run tubeless on just about any rim setup. If you have non-tubeless tires, you may run in to an issue with the tires themselves being too porous, and that is hard to get around. But I imagine that the combination of rim-tape, grommet, and Stans will be fine. The rubber wedge/plug thing on the base of the Stans valve stems is pretty wide, I bet it would work even without the grommet. 

Check the alignment of the rotor as it passes through the caliper. If it's closer to one pad than the other, try to realign the caliper so that it is centered around the rotor. Does the noise "fade in" as you accelerate? Does it get louder and louder as you go faster and faster? Or is there some critical speed at which it starts? Does it go away if you ride the brake very slightly? Sometimes a really mild brake rub will go away if you put just a tiny amount of pressure on the brake. If that's the case, I would just ignore it, it'll probably go away/wear in relatively soon. 

Edited from my comments above: The first thing I would check is whether the hanger is removable. If it is removable, I would check that it is still bolted securely in place. It's pretty common that removable hangers sort of overlap with the dropout. So it's possible that the hanger is loose, and the QR is then clamping it firmly in to place, but then each time you remove and reattach the wheel it clamps in a slightly different position. That could explain the tricky shifting. 

I mean it depends on your current component spec, but I would tend to say disc brakes. Good brakes will do wonders for your confidence riding, and will allow you to ride a broader range of trails, in terms of both trail style and technical difficulty. That said, you can get set up with a set of Avid BB7s for a pretty reasonable price, and leave yourself some money to spend on other components as well. BB7s are a really good, affordable alternative to hydraulic brakes. And they're super easy to maintain. (Note: I don't work for Avid, and I run Shimano hydraulics on my bike. I just think that BB7s are absolutely the best mechanical brake out there, and the best for beginner bikers based on cost, function, and maintainability). 

It will probably work. The one thing you need to look at is the length of your derailleur cage. With that really large cog, you might have to adjust your chain length, and then your derailleur might not be long enough to properly tension the chain. 

I agree with Batman. You can disconnect your front shifter, and use the indexing screws to position the front derailleur to act as a chain guide, and you're good to go. If you're not interested in doing that, I would recommend paying attention to Emyr's advice--chainrings intended to be used with a shifter have "ramps" on the gear teeth to facilitate shifting. If you're not using a derailleur, these can make your chain drop, which is bad. You might want to get a singlespeed-specific front chainring, they're not expensive. But, if you keep your derailleur as a chain guide, you'll be fine. 

Competing in a race would give you a chance to look at all these things, and how they can be done well/poorly. It would also give you a chance to speak to the race organizers in person (although they'll likely be quite busy, you may need to wait until the end) and pick their brains. If going to a different race isn't an option, you might still try to contact organizers and talk to them over the phone. In response to your specific questions, I know there are websites to handle registration; you might check out $URL$ they've done a few races I've been to. Or you could probably get all the info you need with a Google Drive Form, but that might be a little hard. On the upshot, it would be free. As far as timing, there are companies that will rent/come out and operate chip timing equipment (I don't know any off the top of my head), but the budget way to do it is to start two stop watches at exactly the same time in the morning before the race, then send one to the start and one to the finish. Then you have a person at the top recording the starting time of each bib number, and a person at the bottom recording finishing time. At the end of the day you go through and subtract all the start times from the finish times, and presto! This is very cheap, but it's imprecise, and it means you don't get results until the end (unless you have more people with radios communicating times back and forth, which is doable but requires extra hands). Practice runs seem like they're more or less up to you, and could probably be handled with a chalk board. 

I expect that after 10,000 km your chainring also needs to be replaced (frankly, I find it astonishing that you made it that far without replacing anything else. That's amazing.). Am I correct in guessing that you spend most of your time in your middle chainring? If so, it will be significantly more worn than your large or small rings, which would explain why you're only experiencing slippage in that ring. It should be very easy to tell if it needs to be replaced--either take it to your shop and have them look at it, or look at it yourself. Worn chainrings will show a characteristic "shark fin" on the teeth if they're worn too badly. 

There are a variety of industry solutions for crimping stops on to a cable like this. They sometimes require a special crimp tool, but you can usually get by with a vice. You might start with something like this: $URL$ See the second entry, "Stop Sleeves" 

If I had to take my best guess I'd say it's some sort of epoxy or resin. Lord knows how it got there. I would start by trying to get it off with rubbing alcohol. That shouldn't do anything to the paint, and might take it off. If it looks like it's helping, I'd feel free to soak the stuff for a while, it won't hurt. If that doesn't work you may have to break out some meaner stuff, like acetone (most Goo-Off products will be basically 100% acetone) or paint thinner. both of those are really bad for your brain, though, so make sure you use it outside. They're also really volatile, so don't blow yourself up--keep it away from flames (duh) or anything that might spark, including electric motors (fans, etc.). 

I'd say that yes, that indicates a bent derailleur. A bent hangar would cause faulty shifting, but wouldn't cause wear like that. That wear implies that the chain line off, and the chain is rubbing the derailleur cage. There's a chance you can just replace the cage/pulleys and fix the problem, but I'm not sure. If you remount the derailleur is there any visible misalignment? The cage should be straight, and the pulleys should be in line with each other and should rotate in the same plane (e.g. they shouldn't be cock-eyed with respect to one another). 

I agree with @Daniel R Hicks. Those pads aren't terrible, but they're obviously not new either. New pads are cheap, so go ahead and throw a new pair on and see if it helps. It's also possible that the pads are worn enough that even when you pull the lever in all the way they fail to make good contact with the rotor. Are they mechanical brakes? That problem is especially common with mechanical brakes. Lastly, is it possible that you got some sort of oil/fluid on your rotors? That can severely lessen braking power, and it can happen with an invisibly thin film of oil. If you think that is the case, clean the rotors with a non-detergent solvent like goo-gone. Also, can you describe what you mean by "shuddering"?
