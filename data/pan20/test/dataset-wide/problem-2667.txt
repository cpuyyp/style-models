when some immaterialist claims that reality is no more than a simulation, you could react something like Samuel Johnson and stomp on his/her foot and say "I refute you thus!". that should settle the issue. 

I believe the current theory of Quantum Mechanics is that some particles pop into and out of existence all of the time. I think they call that a "quantum fluctuation". I have heard it postulated that the Big Bang was a sorta helluva quantum fluctuation. Very improbable to happen, but if you can wait around for eternity, I guess anything can happen. Skeptic magazine founder Michael Shermer was asked about this and he said something sorta intriguing: "Perhaps something is more stable than nothing." If nothing is a state, then all possible states that this can transition to is either the same nothing (which might be virtually 100% likely, but not exactly 100%) or many zillion possible states of something. But once we've transitioned from nothing to something (despite the unlikelihood, but eventually even the unlikely will happen as long as it is possible) then, when the state is something the likelihood to transition back to a state of nothing (amidst the zillion of other something states) is also tremendously unlikely. Nothing is a state sorta like perfectly balancing a pencil on its tip. Theoretically, if you get it to balance perfectly and if there are no disturbing forces, the pencil should stay balanced on its tip. But if, for whatever reason, including randomness, it were to tilt slightly in any direction, that unstable state of balanced on its tip will transition to a far more stable state of lying on its side in some a priori unknown direction. I think this is sorta what Shermer means when he says that the union of a zillion different states of something is far more stable than the singular state of nothing. 

it's kinda the same as popperian falsifiability in science. developing a new proposed theory that, in essence, says nothing different than the old existing theory does not carry new meaning. the old existing theory is good enough and the new theory is not falsifiable and may not survive as a viable theory. it's only if the new proposed theory makes some claim that differs tangibly from the existing theory, such that one can set up an experiment and observe the difference (or fail to observe it), only those theories are meaningful in science. 

i guess i would ask what user136 means about the "real world". if user136774 means the physical Universe, it appears that the Universe has a finite number of particles (about 10^80), a finite amount of dark mass and dark energy (give it another factor of 10 or so), a finite age (about 10^61 Planck Times), a finite size (about 10^61 Planck Lengths). finite number of stars (maybe 10^24) planets (about the same). whatever. even when they speculate about the concept of other universes, the number i see batted around is 10^(10^(10^7)). enough universes so that every story that can ever be told has happened in at least one of them. but the Multiverse is speculative, not any more falsifiable nor detectable than is a proposition about God. believers in the Multiverse have to concede to holding to a faith. (well, no one is holding a gun to their head, but they should admit it's a faith.) no mortal being has ever measured or beheld an infinite quantity of anything ever. nor ever will. now if the "real world" includes what we can imagine or model, that's an equidae of a different chroma. there are all sorts of different infinities that exist in that world. as a first stab at this, consider the number of rational numbers that exist between 0 and 1 and then the number of irrational numbers between 0 and 1. one is a different species of "infinity" (whatever then hell that is) than the other. 

although often called "The Language of Science", Mathematics is not the same as Science (or, more specifically, Natural Science). Mathematics is a specific application of philosophy and logic to the concept of quantity. whereas in Science that quantity of "stuff", whatever that stuff is, is salient, the techniques of mathematics is necessary to understand more fully what the quantities are, how they may be related, and to speculate in how some quantities may be related to others. in that, there are predictions of how specific physical or natural quantities will behave, experiments devised, observations made, and these predictions are supported or falsified. scientific theories can be developed and supported from that. but there is no such counterpart in pure mathematics. sometimes conjectures are made (such as Bertrand's postulate or Fermat's Last Theorem), but they are just conjectures until they are proved by derivation, not by observation as is done in science. now these two conjectures, now proven mathematical facts will never be disproved in the future. that is also different than falsifiability in science. General Relativity at this time seems like the unrefuted truth, but in another time, so was Newtonian mechanics and gravitation, but now we understand that to be a very close approximation to the truth for slow relative speeds and not in extremely intense gravitational fields. so nothing in Science has the status of never, ever, being falsified. but in mathematics, a properly proven theorem will never be disproven given the same axioms to the theorem. it's different. mathematics and natural science are not the same things. mathematics, although a salient tool in science, is not science. Popperian falsifiability applies to science. it is a demarcation of ultimately what is science and what is not. not all scientists agree with that demarcation, but i do. 

it is my understanding that physicalism denies the existence of the non-physical category of substance. the physicalist or materialist would disputet the dualist's belief that their consciousness is anything more than or other than a manifestation of physical processes (Dennett has said that we are automatons that "think" we have free will). they say that there is no substance to our consciousness other than the physical processes. the dualist would say that there is something substantive about our consciousness that transcends the physical processes. and i think that the physicalists would deny that there exists a different category of physical reality other than energy, subatomic particles, and the such. they would say all of these things simply exist in reality and that their interactions have a completely physical root. (no magic forces, invisible forces maybe, but not having a non-material source.) 

So, is Mark a robot? Are you a robot? I have no idea. It might seem like you are all thinking and understanding stuff, but I can't know for sure if that is what is really happening. I don't really know what I am asking though all this, but I know there is some kind of underlying question. 

If the probability of heads = p , then the probability of tails = 1-p . If it's a fair coin, then p = 1-p and the probability of either heads or tails is p = 1/2. Now suppose the number of coin tosses is N, and let's say that N is getting pretty large. The expected value of the random variable that is the number heads out of the N tosses is going to be around the mean Np, which for an honest coin is N/2. The variance of the random variable (the total number of heads out of N tosses) is Np(1-p) (which, for the honest coin, is N/4) which is the square of the standard deviation. This means if N is increased by a factor of 4, then the standard deviation only increases by a factor of 2. So as the number of tosses increases, the deviation of the number of heads (which is sqrt(N)/2)) from the expected mean (which is N/2) does increase, but not as fast as the number of tosses increases. When you divide by N, the percentage of that expected deviation, inside the total number of tosses, gets smaller and gets closer to the expected 50%. This is because it's (sqrt(N)/2)/N = 1/(2 sqrt(N)) . From a percentage POV, it looks like you're getting closer and closer to what is expected from an honest coin. From a count POV, it doesn't look exactly the same. If you toss an honest coin 1,000,000 times, the number of heads will likely be some distance away from 500,000. But the percentage of the number of heads out of the total number of tosses will be very close to 50%. And it will get closer to 50% with more and more tosses, but the absolute distance away from the 50% mark will grow at a rate proportional to sqrt(N). But the number of tosses is growing at a rate of N. 

it probably is to God, which may be the motivation of God to create human beings with free will. but i don't believe it is necessary for us to know or to presume to know exactly the mind of God to have a freewill response to the Problem of Evil. a question for Alex: 

My name is Mark and I am a robot. I am 19 years old and I attend a university with other people, but you know, I just don't feel like I fit in because I am a robot. It is a fact that I am a robot in the sense that I am really a machine processing a bunch of computations, but it is universally agreed by others that I am a human. Unfortunately, there is no known way to prove that I am human since I am indistinguishable from a human being. I have all the features of a human. I have all the same organs and stuff that humans have, including a brain that is indistinguishable from a human brain. I can engage in seemingly intelligent conversation. I occasionally forget information just as humans do and I can contract all the diseases that humans can. Actually, I was even programmed to convince you that I am a robot. You might think that there are actually "thoughts" in my mind, but really, I have no understanding at all of what I am doing. I am simply reacting to my environment according to rules specified in my memory. Even though I exhibit "morality" like humans, there is no "conscience" at all going on in my brain/processor/memory thing. I am aware of nothing even though it may seem that I am aware of stuff. Sorry about my poor writing style and word choice and sentence structure. I am quite tired right now since I did not have enough sleep last night and I am having a lot of anxiety since I am new here. 

Sometimes there are moral considerations that may require breaking the law. Sometime entitlement is taken in the response to an emergency. Sometimes the moral response to immoral acts by government is civil disobedience. 

there appears to be something goofy about seeking the salvation of humankind in that of sacrifice. just doesn't seem logical. 

it might be that God transcends time just as God transcends space, "stuff", and everything else that is part of creation. perhaps God looks at spacetime in much the same way that physics describes it (where time is just another dimension or axis), but none of us, in our temporal and 3-dimensional existence, can visualize. i wouldn't ascribe too many concrete attributes or properties to God. 

mega, we all have faith in something or 'nother, whether we want to admit it or not. for me, "evidence" of the existence of God lies simply in the existence of the Universe and of reality and our existence in this Universe as beings of consciousness, sentience, and sapience. now "evidence" is not proof and, in this argument never will be. this evidence is this very Universe that shows multiple signs of having been created with purpose. this is called "teleological" reasoning or the "teleological argument". it is not conclusive evidence that will force, from the imposition of logic, an honest doubter to adopt the belief. but it can be sufficient, for someone who chooses to believe in God, to have confidence that their belief is reasonable. but there will always be counter-arguments that the doubters will use to justify their doubt. (or, if i were to be less generous, that the deniers would use to justify their denial.) you'll never win an closed-minded doubter over with any argument regarding God. whether the argument is weak and trite (and there are plenty of those) or reasonable (i won't say "strong", i don't believe there is an undeniably strong argument either for the existence of God or against the existence of God.) i might point to the fine-tuned Universe and they will respond with the Anthropic Principle as a non-divine explanation. i might point out that the Strong Anthropic Principle (SAP) requires quite a leap of faith itself and they will respond with the Weak Anthropic Principle (WAP) which is essentially a tautology or truism. the WAP has to be true, because it's a tautology. and, because it's a tautology, it doesn't say much. it's like saying 5=5. a kinda "empty truth" (and i know i am semantically misusing that term, but i don't care; i am trying to make a point.) then they will say, "Well, the WAP provides a perfectly natural explanation for Fine-tuning by showing that the human perception of Fine-tuning is simply an example of selection bias. then i will say, "For selection bias to suffice in removing any notion of the remarkability of Fine-tuning of the Universe, that requires a large collection of universes from which to select a life-friendly universe." then they will say "Yeah! Q.E.D!" they may even point to different mathematical models of the multiverse, some of which are logically consistent and may even be true. but we will never know. because, for the same reason i will never create a God-measuring-device or a falsifiable physical experiment that will show, one way or 'nother, that God exists (or not), neither will they ever create a similar falsifiable experiment demonstrating the existence of any universes outside of the observable universe. so it's fine to believe in the Multiverse. it might even be true (and even if true, that would only push the argument of infinite regress back a level; i would argue that God created the Multiverse). but i don't need the existence of the multiverse to have an understanding of the existence of me. however, what if this forever unmeasureable Multiverse doesn't exist? what if the Universe we live in is the only one? that appeared some 13.8 billion years ago (perhaps as a hell-of-a quantum fluctuation)? well, for the 26 or so fundamental physical constants to come out just right so that sufficient carbon was cooked up but for the same process to not fit so well in cooking up oxygen that all of the carbon would have been converted to oxygen, for there to be the other elemental diversity so that small rocky planets such as Earth could exist for life to emerge and beings like us to evolve and wonder how we got here, for all of this to be set to happen 13.8 billion years ago, causes this conscious, sentient, and sapient being to wonder if all of this creativity must have come about from purpose. as opposed to purposeless and "undirected processes". they can believe in their unproveable explanation and i can believe in mine. and, when you boil it down, both require "the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen", what some unknown author 2000 years ago defined as "faith". and that is all the proof you can hope to get out of it.
