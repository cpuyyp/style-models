I'm talking about the third plural form of medium/passive perfect, in Ancient Greek. My grammar explains that some very simple verb like παιδεύω may be inflected that way : 

The Ancient Greek word τρόπος meant originally "turn", hence various meanings like "way (to be), manner, style"... and even "way to sing/compose" like in Plato's Republic 424c μουσικῆς τρόποι "~ musical modes". The Latins created the (post classical) verb * tropare "~ invent, compose an air", lately "~ compose a poem" and finally "~ compose, invent". The word is attested in French from the tenth century (in the Saint-Léger poem, v. 100) with the meaning "~ invent, meet by chance", hence the modern meanings. 

If you mean what I think you mean, then Hebrew is noted for this. The same construction (with the construct form of a noun) is used for possession: 

It is a coincidence. The prefix "yotta-" is in no way Greek. It is a modern, invented, coinage, derived from Greek ὀκτώ (okto) by a very roundabout and idiosyncratic route. Armenian յոթ (yot') derives from Old Armenian եօթն (eot'n), older եւթն (ewtʿn), ultimately from IndoEuropean *septḿ̥ See Wiktionary here and here 

"How to prove" something that probably isn't true, is rather difficult. According to this site, the Thai word has a solid etymology pla.A in proto-Tai-Kadai. If this is true (and I have no idea how reliable the site is, but it looks plausible) then the word is not a loanword from Sanskrit, and has no connection with the PIE root (unless you subscribe to one of the controversial super-grouping theories). 

Latin castōr (a beaver) is nothing but a loan-word from the Greek. There's no evidence that Κάστωρ (the proper name) and κάστωρ (the beaver) have a different origin. But as far as I know, nothing in the legend of the Διόσκουροι deal with a beaver, or with a specific animal. Is there a connection between both names ? 

The Greek poeter Ψάπφω/Ψάπφα beared an interesting name, probably not Greek. I have two questions, about the first and the last letter of her name : (1) what was the value of the initial Ψ ? This letter was later written Σ but I read in a French edition(*) (my translation) : 

We can't. In five hundred years' time maybe they'll say it's going on now, and maybe they won't. The concept of a sound-change being "complete" makes sense only if you have in some way identified the end-point with respect to which you're defining completion. 

I believe that this system is imported wholesale from Chinese, but I know much less about that, which is why I have concentrated on Japanese. 

I don't know another language which has singulatives like Welsh. But it's well to remember that Welsh, like English and the Western Romance languages, has lost all its case inflection except on pronouns. The reason I bring this up is that in Russian and other Slavonic languages many nouns have a suffix except in the genitive plural (eg рука (ruka) 'hand'; рук (ruk) 'hand gen. pl') Now I'm pretty sure that Welsh singulatives aren't like this, and they do actually contain a singulative suffix (IIRC plant 'children' is borrowed from Latin planta, so the singular plentyn must be derived). But you can't tell that from their current form. 

I was very surprised to learn (in LSJ s.v. ἑκηβόλος) that ἑκηβόλος originally meant "attaining his aim" and not "far-shooter" as I always thought. If the Liddell-Scott-Jones recalls the later interpretation of the word (ἑκη- < ἑκάς=far), this dictionary doesn't explain the original form, hence my questions : (a) What's the etymology of "ἑκη-" ? (b) Do we know some Greek authors explaining how they understand the epiklesis ? addendum : I found here a good(?) analysis of another problem concerning the epiklesis "ἑκατηβόλος". According to Dominique Thillaud, ἑκη- can be... 

I'm looking for a detailed description of the Old English syllable. Wikipedia gives me clear information about the onset and the nucleus but nothing about the coda. I'd appreciate any document describing the last part of the "(C)3V(C)3" structure given by Wikipedia; alas, this information is not sourced. Any help would be appreciated ! 

According to Wiktionary, this is true for several Semitic (Hebrew, Arabic, Amharic, Maltese), Turkic (Turkish, Turkmen, Kazakh), and Finno-Ugric (Finnish, Hungarian, Eastern Mari) languages, and some others including Mongolian, Hausa,Zulu. Whether any of these have been influenced by each other, or by Indo-European, I can't say. I observe the biblical "If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, may my tongue stick to the roof of my mouth", which is often interpreted to mean "May I lose the power of speech". 

This is a list of Arabic corpora, with notes about their origins. While I doubt if any of them specifically exclude Quranic quotations, many of them will be predominantly non-Quranic. 

Even if these languages belong to the Indo-European family, there's a huge gap of time and space standing between Pre-Italic and Pre-Germanic languages. "A probable cladistic tree of the IE family"(a) shows e.g. that the Italo-Celtic subfamily and the "Central IE" subfamily (including Germanic) diverges long before Germanic and Indo-Iranian diverged. "The last common ancestor of Germanic and Italo-Celtic was probably spoken at least 5,000 years ago".(c) "We can [...] say [...] that PGmc was spoken [...] not earlier than about 500 BC"(d) By contrast, "There are [...] four or five Latin inscriptions datable to before 600 BC" and "A number of [languages other than the Latin one] are known from Italy in the first millenium BC".(b) The differences are consequently innumerable; I will take only one consequence of such a huge gap between Germanic and Latin languages, described in (e). When these last two languages enter in contact, each one borrowed some words from the other one and applied to these words its own linguistical rules. E.g. Latin "Caesar" > Proto-Gmc *kaisaraz . 

Van der Merve, Naudé and Kroeze (A Biblical Hebrew Reference Grammar) say (s. 18.8) that "Instead of the Piel, Pual and Hithpael stem formations, the II waw and II yod verbs have a Polel, Polal and Hithpolel stem formation, respectively. It is clear from the names of these stem formations that the final stem consonant is repeated. The conjugation of verbs in these stem formations is otherwise regular". So the Piel participle of קומ, for example, is given as מְקוֹמֵם. 

Wikipedia says "If a numeral is used with a noun, then the plural suffix is usually not used". (Unreferenced, unfortunately, but it agrees with my memory from when I studied Turkish.) So, no, neither the case nor the number of nouns changes with different numerals. I believe the use of the genitive singular for (numbers ending in) 2, 3 or 4, as opposed to the genitive plural for larger numbers in Slavonic languages is generally regarded as a paucal form, a generalisation of the dual.
