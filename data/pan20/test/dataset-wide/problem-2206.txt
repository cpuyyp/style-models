There is no single official worldwide volleyball statistics definition. But we can take a look at a representative comprehensive source for definitions of volleyball statistics: 2015 NCAA Official Volleyball Statistics Rules. Their definition of “dig” is the following (in “Section 4—Digs”): 

However, UEFA (the European football association) uses a different system in its competitions, where results from the matches between the teams concerned are given more importance than the results from the rest of the group matches (plus, there are more auxiliary criteria when everything else fails). See e.g. the official Regulations of the UEFA European Football Championship 2012 which state in the rule 8.07: 

But he cannot continue playing so, and definitely cannot “assume the risk of injury”. Note that there is an offense of playing “in a dangerous manner” which includes possible injury to the player himself, and which is penalized by an indirect free kick. (But that is purely theoretical, I believe; normally, should the player attempt playing barefoot, the referee would instruct him to correct his equipment.) 

I think it was the 4-4-2. it had slighter modification like 4-1-2-1-2 and 4-2-2-2. 4-3-3 was used in attacking situations when in search of plenty of goals. 4-2-2 was more of a normal formation. Wingers were the most important part of English football strategy. in 4-3-3 there is no Wingers and therefore not very widely used in EPL 

The fielding captain or the bowler who balls the 1st over of the match decides it. The factor mostly considered are wind direction. The umpires do not explicitly say anything about the end which the game play starts. There is no rule also based about it. Maybe the people who wrote the rule book might have thought this as a Minor part of the Game. 

In earlier times players used to put the hands up in a rather static manner near the net while their team is servicing. this shades the server from opposition. But according to the changed rule you cant keep a fully stretched stationary arms above your head while you are in the 3m box and your team is serving. But still a semi stretched or moving arm is allowed. it might be the referees' will, but most of them agree to it this way. 

) I did not find any more stringent criteria. The more general International Ski Competition Rules define the following for slalom races (and similarly for the other race types): 

Petra Kvitová has a record of playing the biggest number of three-set matches, which is not something to be very proud of, I guess, but it has earned her the affectionate nickname “P3tra”. 

First of all, it’s far from “any touch of the net is a fault”. The actual rule (11.3.1) is that “Contact with the net by a player between the antennae, during the action of playing the ball, is a fault.” (emphasis mine). The next paragraph explains the action of playing the ball includes take-off, hit (or attempt), and landing. That includes touches by the attacking player, the player blocking him, etc., but it excludes e.g. a blocker on the opposite side of the net who was confused by a fake attack. Even though he wanted to block the ball, his contact was not a fault, as he was actually not near the ball, so he was not in the action of playing it. Also, it excludes touches made when not playing the ball at all. For instance, if a blocker lands and then turns, touching the net with his shoulder, it is not a fault, the touch has not occurred during the action of playing the ball. However, if a player interferes with the play, even outside the action of playing the ball, that is a fault. (For instance, a player tripping and then using the net for support.) As for the specific question you ask: if the ball flies into the net causing it to hit a stationary player on the opposite side, it is not a fault. However, if the player has deliberately moved his hands close to the net to alter the rebound of the ball (preventing the opponent from recovering the ball from the net in case of remaining team hits), I believe this could be called a net fault. (It would definitely be a net fault in beach volleyball.) 

Even in the modern era you could find teams playing with a sweeper. Its not obsolete. But is considered heavily defensive. When you play a sweeper the formation followed is mostly 1-4-4-1 or 1-4-3-2. You can see this followed when two teams off very different calibers meet and its usually the weaker team that employs a sweeper. The modern and better reputed teams do not employ sweeper because they don't become a part in total football. in total football as the question poster mentioned the role of sweeper is shared by the two central defenders. I don't think the defensive mid has anything to do with SW becoming obsolete. 

Bat speed in cricket is the velocity that a batter can achieve with his customized slab of English willow, But i believe there is no standard of how to measure it has been accepted. It is largely the television channels that measure the speed of bat and it is from the video their cameras capture. Its mostly the speed of swing from stationary position to hitting the ball position. The nature of pitch surely affects the pace of ball. A dry dusty pitch and a very damp pitch is slower because the ball grips and holds to the surface more. A skiddy kind of pitch with a little moisture will have a slight increase in pace due lower value of coefficient of friction. The difference in pace caused by difference in the texture of the pitch is less than 5mph. 

Also, I especially recommend watching teaching videos for referees available as a part of the FIVB Multimedia Teaching Material for Referees: First, click Net Rule Move in the left menu and watch the video. Then, navigate to rule 11 in the contents menu and click Jump to the videos to see a list of applicable video examples. 

Which means the answer for your first question is no, this is not a dig. And the answer for your second question is yes, this is still a dig, even though the attack was slowed by the block. Other official bodies or specific competitions might use a different definition, but I believe the basic principles would be the same. 

We are talking about the last point in this case. And, in the official interpretation of the Laws of the Game (p. 102), it is defined thus: 

How are “unclean hits” judged in tennis? I mean situations like a ball slipping on a racket, or unintentionally hitting the racket twice (e.g. when the player does not hold the racket firmly enough). In the official rules, I have found rule 24 (f), stating the point is lost if “The player deliberately carries or catches the ball in play on the racket or deliberately touches it with the racket more than once” (emphasis mine). Does this mean unintentional double touches or prolonged contact are fine? Also, my friends debated whether hits by the rim are allowed or not. As I have found no mention about that in the rules, I suppose hits by any part of the racket (not only the strings) are allowed. Is that correct?
