Of course the more the cleat interacts with other surfaces, the more it wears. My experience with SPD-SL cleats is the "primary unclipping foot" wears down a bit quicker, although I usually replace both at the same time (partly for convenience, plus I find the yellow "walking grips" wearing out more evenly, so are worth replacing as a pair) Similarly, the pedal on the primary-unclipping side will likely wear quicker - for example, after around 15,000km: 

In addition to the wheel related differences (rolling resistance via tread, pressure etc), there's countless other mechanical reasons one bike might just be faster.. I guess the main thing is to consider all the places where friction could occur. E.g unlikely but maybe the brakes are rubbing a bit on one bike? Or maybe the wheel-hubs or bottom-bracket are a bit gummed up? Maybe one chain is more worn and in need of lubrication? etc etc 

To crudely simplify things, a triathlon/TT bike position is much the same as a road position, but basically "rotated forward", so your arms rest atop the very-low-set bars. A consequence of this is, the seat ends up further forward. 

I think that the answer to this question is not "how fast can you safely go?", but rather to look at the inverse, "how fast do you need to safely stop?". If you are on a long road with no side roads, and no chance of animals, dirt, gravel, stopped cars, braking cars, etc, then your maximum speed is very much a personal decision. As others in this question have mentioned, there are others who have almost certainly done it faster! However, in the real world where you do need to deal with some of these things… coming off of your bike at 40mph, is going to hurt… at best. Braking at those speeds is also going to be challenging, and, just like in a car, the faster you are going, the longer it takes to brake. And this is not a linear relationship. Add to that your brakes won't work as well anyway, since you also need to fight gravity when you are on a hill. 

Apologies for my dodgy graphics work, the middle is threaded, and sized to fix the (slightly larger than the wheel nut thread) centre of the coaster brake axel, the outsides smooth (very much resembling a washer) except for the two grooves. The entre part is perhaps 20mm in diameter; unfortunately my bright idea of drawing the part, and then using Google image search has failed me! In the end, I'm sure this particular bolt is a strange european relic designed as some kind of "security" bolt; not dissimilar to the Apple style 5-point start, or similar, to discourage people against fiddling with their coaster brake. But I would really like to rebuild the brake! I'm sure I could replace them with regular "cone nuts" - that is the ones with two flat sides, but the term "cone nut" seems to refer more to the purpose than the design of the nut itself. All information appreciated, thanks in advance! 

I'm attempting to refurbish a bike that I was given, it has a (not sure what brand) coaster brake, which according to sheldon brown's site has a peculiar kind of cone nut. The wheel might be 10 years old, it's hard to say. I've been able to remove the otherwise butchered nuts (see below) using a tap & hammer and an axle vice, now that they are free I'd like to know what they are, so that I can replace them, do they have a special name? I've only ever seen mention of cone nuts resembling a regular washer, but with two flat sides (sorry for the poor explanation) - these that this bike is fitted with are something different, see below: 

However that is a fairly massive increase in weight. Increasing your body weight that much would be "unhealthy", and increasing the bike weight would very likely negatively influence handling.. Smaller increases in weight (a few kilograms etc) will increase your speed downhill somewhat.. but it would probably be far more productive to work on reducing aerodynamic drag. An extreme example would be a recumbent bicycle (much smaller frontal area than a typical road bike, and can have an outer shell to further reduce drag), however there are plenty of other ways to do this, like adopting rather unsafe positions on the bike, or wearing funny shaped helmets and more aerodynamic clothing (triathlon/timetrial skinsuits) 

This research claims around walking 334 kilojoules of energy expended for a 1.6km walk Using the same 1.6km distance, if you cycled at 20km/h at 70watts (arbitrary but vaguely-plausible numbers), you would be involve around 20 kilojoules being "sent to the pedals". Assuming you are about 20% efficient, that would be 100kilojoules burned For that distance, at a relatively leisurely pace, walking uses more energy. However, there is more to it than that: Cycling is a more efficient means of transport. Both methods may use similar amounts of energy, but cycling will be faster. This means you could cycle a longer route to work, "burn more calories", and still get to work at the same time. Then again, cycling has it's drawbacks - it requires more supporting equipment (a bike being the main part, also things like a helmet, puncture repair kit, maybe lights, and of course somewhere to securely park the bike) ..but really, the most important factor is doing something. Maybe choosing cycling would mean you would spend months saving up the money before you even start? Or maybe you'll enjoy cycling, and start going on longer rides, for fun? Finally, remember the natural reaction to more exercise is simply "eat more". It is hard and requires conscious effort to go against this (to increase exercise without eating more)

Edit: Curiously, I seem getting getting different results to other people. I can view the S1, I just checked the link again, and it works for me, it also gives prices in AUD. It also works for me from a Dutch host, and gives prices in EUR. Perhaps it it is not sold in your region and that is why you get the 404? Using googlecache I can also see the S1. As to the S2, again, using the googlecache link I can see that the US has both a 50/34 and a 53/39 setup. The four configurations from that link are: 

So the same link seems to serve up different content depending on which country you are viewing it from, not only the price in the local currency, but also different sets of configurations. 

In the past I have used the Look road pedals and the SPD system, however I know that there are many other systems, including some that work purely on magnets. What are the advantages of the various systems, and when would you recommend them? 

(source 1 and source 2 - I couldn't find a good side-on picture for the road-position, so it has quite a lot of skewing to align to the TT-position picture) This "Proper Bike Fit for Triathletes" article has a vastly more detailed explanation (and is the source of the first diagram!) 

In a practical sense, increased weight will make you go downhill faster, for the same reason decreasing weight will make you go uphill faster See this interactive calculator. If you set the gradient to "-10", set "Power P (watts)" to 0.001 (i.e almost zero): 

(the complete file file, captured with firmware v2.051) I could well be mistaken, but the data seems either useless or broken to me: 

Quoted like that, the 1580watt number will be for 1 second most likely. 1 second is the typical recording rate of the SRM PowerControl units (same with the Garmin Edge). So unless a duration is specified, "maximum" will refer to the highest recorded sample in the file (the PowerControl can record faster than 1 sample/second, but the higher rates are typically only used for analysing events like standing starts in track racing, not for 200km road-race stages, where 0.25 second resolution is excessive) Update: This article on "The profile of a sprint" gives some specific numbers: 

I have two bicycles that suffer this problem, both pretty heavy frames (one a ladies, Hollander bike, and the other a man's commuter) - both have correctly adjusted Derailleurs which don't produce any noise or rub on the chain during normal riding. However with both, on flat ground, at nominal speed - once every 3-10 revolutions of the chain it will simply skip; there's no drive for a quarter of a turn and then everything is OK. I had originally assumed that this was a misalignment, or normal chain-skip (as I had only noticed it under heady load, cycling hard out of the saddle. However noticing the same happens on my girlfriend's bike, and on mine when I'm taking it easy disconcerts me, and leaves me with little confidence in the bike. I'm not sure where to start diagnosing, however I suspect that stripping the drive train might be a start… perhaps also examining the chain for nipped-links, and the sprockets for damaged teeth (although, both bikes have a bash-guard on the front sprocket) Any help or advice greatly appreciated, I'm a pretty handy motorcycle mechanic, but I always found working on my Human powered bikes a lot more fiddly :)
