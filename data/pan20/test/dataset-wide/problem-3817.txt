Since $\mathbb{Z}/N^*$ is abelian, the conjugacy part of the definition of abelianness doesn't come directly into this theorem, but it will arise in the proof. So, what is a Euclidean proof? Well, at some step in the proof, I must build a prime $p$ and say "$p$ has the property $P$, and therefore $p$ is in $S$." In every Euclidean proof I have seen, $P$ is one of two things: (1) There is a number $M$ such that $M$ is not in some subgroup $G$ of $(\mathbb{Z}/N)^*$. So $M$ has a prime divisor which is not in $G$, and we choose $p$ to be that prime factor. So an allowable step in a Euclidean-proof is showing that there are infinitely many primes not in some subgroup $G$ of $(\mathbb{Z}/N)^*$ (2) Some polynomial $f(X)$ factors in a particular way modulo $p$, and therefore $f$ lies in some class modulo $N$. (Generally, the observation is that $f$ has a root modulo $p$, but I'll allow more general things like $f$ has a quadratic factor" as well. For a polynomial $f$ of degree $n$, and a partition $\lambda$ of $n$, let $D(f, \lambda)$ be the set of primes such that the irreducible factors of $f$ have degrees $(\lambda_1 \lambda_2, \ldots, \lambda_r)$. And let $D(f, \lambda, N)$ be the image of $D(f, \lambda)$ modulo $N$. So an allowable step in an Euclidean-proof will be showing that there are infinitely many primes in some union of $D(f, \lambda, N)$'s. So, what I will actually be proving is 

The graduate students here at MIT have been thinking about questions like the following: Over $\mathbb{F}\_q$, how many symmetric matrices are there with nonzero determinant and $0$'s on the diagonal? They are doing brute force computer searches; checking every point in $\mathbb{A}^N(\mathbb{F}\_q)$ and seeing whether it is in the variety. Is there a better way? Their examples are, like the above, low codimension subvarieties of high dimensional affine spaces. I think they are usually looking at smooth varieties, but I wouldn't swear to it in every case. The ideal answer, of course, would be preexisting software. 

UPDATE I think question 2 is false! Let $C$ be a smooth cubic curve in $\mathbb{P}^2$, and choose a flex on $C$ to be the origin, so $C$ has a group structure. Take $C'$ to be equal to $C$, but with the map $C' \to C$ being the doubling map in the group law. So $d'=4$. If $L$ is a line in $\mathbb{P}^2$, and $L \cap C = \{ x,y,z \}$, then $x+y+z=0$ in the group law. If $2 x'=x$, $2y' =y$ and $2 z'=z$, then $x'+y'+z'$ is a $2$-torsion point of $C'$. If we move $(L, x',y',z')$ continuously, we can't change which $2$-torsion point $x'+y'+z'$ is. So there are (at least) four separate connected components in the space of $(x',y',z')$ triples. 

Well, I wish you the best. But I don't think you are going to succeed for two reasons: (1) Proving almost anything about $\zeta(2k+1)$ is hard. (2) There are nice formulas for $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \cos (n \theta)/n^{2k}$ and for $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \sin (n \theta)/n^{2k+1}$. There are not particularly nice formulas for $\sin$ with even powers or $\cos$ with odd. One way to think about this is that the imaginary part of $\log (1-e^{i \theta})$ has a simple formula but the real part does not. 

The answer to all three questions is "no". This answer uses the same strategy as my earlier answer, but is a lot simpler in details because it puts most of the complexity into the ring $S$ rather than the ideal $I$. Let $k$ be an infinite field. Let $p_1$, $p_2$, ..., $p_9$ be $9$ generic points in $\mathbb{P}_k^2$; let $x$, $y$ and $z$ be the homogenous linear coordinates on $\mathbb{P}^2$. Let $A = k[w_1, w_2, \ldots, w_9,x,y,z]$. We will consider $A$ as a ring graded by $\mathbb{Z}^{10}$, where we separately keep track of the degrees in the $w_j$'s but lump the $x$, $y$ and $z$ degrees together. So an element of $A$ is homogenous if it is of the form $\prod_i w_i^{r_i} \cdot f(x,y,z)$ with $f$ a homogenous polynomial of some degree, which we will denote $d$. All our rings will be graded subrings of $A$. Let $N_9$ be the graded subring of $A$ where $\prod w_i^{r_i} \cdot f(x,y,z)$ is in $N_9$ if, for each $i$, the polynomial $f(x,y,z)$ vanishes to order $\geq d-r_i$ at $p_i$. Let $N_8$ be the analogous subring of $k[w_1, \ldots, w_8, x,y,z]$, using the points $p_1$ through $p_8$. Nagata showed that $N_8$ is finitely generated over $k$, and $N_9$ is not. Let $S = N_8[w_1]$. Choose coordinates on $\mathbb{P}^2$ so that $x$ and $y$ vanish at $p_9$ and $z$ does not. Set $\tilde{x} = w_1 w_2 \cdots w_8 x$, $\tilde{y} = w_1 w_2 \cdots w_8 y$ and $\tilde{z} = w_1 w_2 \cdots w_8 w_9 z$. Set $R = k[w_1, w_2, \ldots, w_9, \tilde{x}, \tilde{y}, \tilde{z}]$. So $R \subset S$; as $S$ is a finitely generated $k$ algebra, it is a finitely generated $R$ algebra. Set $I = w_9 R$. We claim that $$S \cap R_I = N_9. \quad (\ast)$$ Furthermore, we claim that the kernel of $N_9 \to R_I/I R_I$ is $w_9 N_9$. So the image is $N_9/(w_9 N_9)$, which we will show below is also not finitely generated. Since $S$ is a graded subring of $A$, as is $R$, and $I$ is a graded ideal, the intersection $S \cap R_I$ is a graded subring. Let $g=\prod w_i^{r_i} f(x,y,z)$ be a homogenous element, with $\deg f =d$. First, suppose that $g \in N_9$. Then clearly $g \in S$. Also, since $f$ vanishes to order $\geq d-r_9$ at $p_9$, we can write $w_9^{r_9} f(x,y,z)$ as a polynomial in $x$, $y$ and $z w_9$. Note that $x$, $y$ and $z$ are $(w_1 \cdots w_8)^{-1} \tilde{x}$, $(w_1 \cdots w_8)^{-1} \tilde{y}$ and $(w_1 \cdots w_8)^{-1} \tilde{z}$ so they are in $R_I$. Therefore, $w_9^{r_9} f(x,y,z)$ is in $R_I$. Since $w_1$ through $w_8$ are also in $R_I$, this shows that $g$ is in $R_I$. So $N_9 \subseteq S \cap R_I$. Now, suppose that $g$ is in $S \cap R_I$. Since $g \in S$, we see that $f$ vanishes to order $\geq d-r_i$ at $p_i$ for $1 \leq i \leq 8$. Since $g$ in $R_I$, we can write $g=a/b$ with $a \in R_I$ and $b \in R_I - I$. Since $R$ is a UFD, we can assume that $a$ and $b$ are relatively prime in $R = k[w_1, w_2, \ldots, w_9, \tilde{x}, \tilde{y}, \tilde{z}]$. If $b$ has factors other than the $w_j$'s, then $a/b$ won't be in $R$, sos we may assume that $b$ is of the form $\prod_{j \leq 8} w_j^{q_j}$. We can then write $g = \prod_{j \leq 8} w_j^{s_j} \cdot w_9^{s_9} h(\tilde{x}, \tilde{y}, \tilde{z}) = \prod_{j \leq 8} w_j^{s_j+d} \cdot w_9^{s_9} h(x,y,w_9 z)$ for some constants $s_j$. If we write $h(x,y,w_9 z) = w_9^r f(x,y,z)$ then $f$ vanishes to order $d-r$ at $p_9$ and $d-r \geq d-(r+s_9)=d-r_9$. So we have shown that $g$ is in $N_9$. We have now established $(\ast)$. Similar arguments show that $g \in S \cap I R_I$ if and only if $f$ vanishes to order $> d-r_9$ at $p_9$, if and only if $w_9$ divides $g$ in $N_9$. I'll omit the details (but please challenge me if you think I'm wrong!). So the image of $N_9$ in $R_I / I R_I$ is $N_9 / w_9 N_9$. We now recall the following lemma: Lemma: Let $N$ be a positively graded $k$-algebra whose degree $0$ part is $k$. Let $J$ be a finitely generated graded ideal of $N$. Then $N/J$ is finitely generated if and only if $N$ is. Proof: Clearly, if $N$ is finitely generated, then any quotient of $N$ is. Conversely, suppose that $a_1$, $a_2$, ..., $a_m$ is a list of generators for $J$ as an ideal, and $\bar{b}_1$, ..., $\bar{b}_n$ is a list of generators for the $k$-algebra $N/J$. Let $b_i$ be a lift of $\bar{b}_i$ to $N$. We may assume that the $a_i$ and $b_i$ are homogenous and of positive degree. We claim that $N$ is generated by the $a$'s and $b$'s. We show, by induction on $N_d$, that $N_d$ is contained in the $k$-subalgebra of $N$ generated by the $a$'s and $b$'s. Let $g \in N_d$. Then there is a polynomial $p$ so that $g \equiv p(a_1, \ldots, a_m) \bmod J$. Thus, $g = p(a_1, \ldots, a_m) + \sum b_i h_i$ for some $h_i \in N$. The $h_i$ are of lower degree, so inductively, the $h_i$ are in the subalgebra generated by the $a$'s and $b$'s, and thus $g$ is in this algebra. $\square$ Since $N_9$ is not finitely generated, this lemma shows that $N_9 / w_9 N_9$ isn't either.
