Given your stated reason for the policy, I would not take it seriously at all; whether I followed it would be purely a function of how much I wanted to humor you or were afraid for my job. If you want people to follow it, reconsider the motivations and have a reason they can take seriously! And if you can't, you might find another way to achieve the effect you want, such as not putting monitors in places where visitors can see what's on the screens. (that's probably a good idea anyways) 

Then, to ensure there aren't obstacles that would tempt employees to just memorize the steps, you ensure that the list is easy to find and access, with a minimum of frustration involved that would tempt them to just memorize the steps and perform them without reference to L. To further tempt people into doing the right thing, you don't make L a simple list, you add information and tools (or references to such) that help people carry out the individual steps X, Y, and Z. Or even go all the way and make a tool that assists people in carrying out task T that works and is convenient to use â€” once you get people hooked on the idea that "you use tool L to do task T" and tool L is actually usable, they would rarely even consider doing it any other way. And now, when the procedures change, you just update L. 

Don't sweat it. You are just one in a long line of flakeball interns. Companies do not expect much from interns, which is why they don't pay them very much. I am sure the manager barely remembers you at this point. I can't even remember the interns that worked for me, much less the ones who disappeared prematurely. 

That is a tricky problem. Tell them that learning on the job is fine with you and that you have an agreed on start date and that you NEED to start on that date for financial reasons. 

People tend to complain about pay when the work is not motivating. If somebody believes in what they are doing and is enthusiastic about greater goals, they do not complain. If the work is stifling and pointless, they will complain about everything, starting with the pay. It comes down to leadership. If the leader is exciting, engaging and doing interesting things, people will be happy. Sounds like that might not be the case in your company. If the leadership is strong enough, people will work for nothing. I remember a story of Andrew Jackson, whose forces in the Crow War suffered incredible privations. One day, one of his men came to him complaining of hunger; all of them were starving. Jackson said to the man, "I will split what I have with you." and he pulled five acorns out of his pocket. At one company I worked for we had a programmer who was far more talented than anyone else and he reported to me. He said to me, "I am still here because of you. If I wasn't working for you, I would have quit a long time ago." 

@Roland pointed something interesting out : If your thing realy is learning as much as possible because you love it then academia may be what you're searching for. If not then you may want to work for a realy big company at a big post where every of your skills (IT , law , management , etc) will be required and where having all theese degrees and be 30+ won't be a problem. But it's not an easy path and theese jobs often come with low personnal time so if it's not 100% what you're searching for you may not be happy with it. There's also the possibility you're not interested in working for a big group but still want to get all theese degrees. In that case since you seem to be a great developper already you could try to save time freelance to get the money you want. But if you're not sure you need theese degrees , are afraid of how having 3 degrees can prevent you from getting a job and don't mind working right after your PhD then maybe you could find an intresting job right after this PhD and fulfill your learning thirst on your free time ! 

Companies can be big places. One group or division may have completely different practices than another. I would not worry too much about what other people in the company are doing. Usually each programmer works on their own stuff. In 25 years of programming I have never had somebody mess with my code at any significant level. When people take over other peoples code I find they always rewrite it completely. As far as debugging other people's code, that is inevitable. The more junior and less productive you are, the more cleanup and junk work you will get. If you are highly productive, you will spend very little time doing secondhand coding. There is nothing more annoying than a junior 3000-lines-a-year programmer complaining about the style of the base code. Once, a company I was at hired a contractor of weak abilities who was assigned to work on some components which were a tiny fraction of my output and complained about my "spaghetti" code. Of course, Mr. Beautiful Code did not actually write much beautiful code and consequently he was fired after a few weeks. Personally, I never have a problem with other people's code. I don't care how bad it is, or what language it is, or what its style is. I am a master programmer so I can handle it and it doesn't bother me at all. Once I wanted to play tennis with somebody and they refused, saying, "Sorry, I don't play with bad tennis players because it throws off my game." That's the mark of a total amateur. If you think playing with a novice will "throw off your game", you have a long way to go to master class. If you want to know what good code looks like, check out Google Code Jam. The submissions from the top guys there completely blow me away. I am a very good programmer, but seeing that stuff, it is like watching a grandmaster play chess, just amazing. Forget the OO nonsense your professors spout, they are worthless; let the Code Jam guys be your models, because they are gods. You will learn WAY more reading their code than some dumb design handbook. 

You seem to have to deal with a real brat , and there's not a lot of things to do in this situation. You're not his manager , you can't chose to fire him because of his behaviour but you're actually too nice when you answer him , which lets him think he can keep doin doing it. (Which he does) You have to remind him who you are , prove him you are his superior due to your experience. Play his game , better than he does. Stop giving him the choice. He complains about your tasks being easier ? Give them to him , and take his tasks , without giving him choice. He shouts to the office earlier due to personal reasons ? Ask him about his overtime , and how you're doing much more than him. He speaks about statistics ? Nice , this one is an easy to deal with one. Asks for the statistics , and if he can't show them ask him to shut up until he has any proofs about what he's talking about. I cold give you many other ways to deal with him , but you have to understand that you don't have to be polite to him. Always be ready to challenge him , about everything. He'll soon prove to everybody how much of an arrogant jackass he is. There's a reason for ppl to respect seniors (even if that's just a work title). They have more experience and knowledge than we do. Make a use of this to remind him why he should respect you. 

You should tell your boss that the equations being provided to you assume too much knowledge of mathematics/physics. The scientists need to further process the equations and lay them out for you in a way that a high school student can understand. They can do this, its just that they aren't bothering to. (I should warn that your problem might be more than complex equations. Just because you understand an equation does not necessarily mean you will be able to program it. Scientific programming is a skill that can require years of experience. It is possible that both you and your employer do not realize that translating math into code is not necessarily a simple task. In that case they will either have to scale back their expectations or hire somebody with more experience, which they might not have the money to do.) 

Salary mentality at a given company is something that comes with the territory. You cannot change it. For example, imagine they acceded to all your demands and paid you $25 per hour. What would happen when other people in the company at the same level found out you were making more than double their wage? It's just a hypothetical question, but the executives at your company will have thoughts like these at the forefront of their mind. What a given employer offers in terms of salary depends on all kinds of factors, many of which you may have no knowledge of. Maybe the company has a huge, secret debt, or the CEO has a gambling habit; you have no way of knowing what considerations go into salary decisions. Without that knowledge it is difficult to bargain effectively outside of the company norms. When you accept a company, you are implicitly accepting their pay scales. If you want to get paid more your main option is to work for a different company. 

I think you should put the contracting agency on your resume because you don't know what kind of contract was signed between the companies , and the client might not want other people to know about it. 

You should ask your friends more details about what the job realy is, how's a day at work, details about the environement could also be great. You could dislike an intresting jobs because of a negative workplace. Basicly it's up to you to list what you like and what you lack at your current job, and compare with what your friend will describe his job like. 

From my experience I tell you that you should ask. I've been in the same situation and being honest turned out pretty well. I told them I was interviewing at others companies at the same time , and that some of them already made an offer but they (company C) were my first choice , and that I would realy like to have an answer from them before accepting (or not) the offer from an other company. They told me they understood the problem , and scheduled an interview pretty fast. As long as you show them you're honest about them being your first choice , I don't see how this can give a bad impression. In the case they disagree , as suggested you should try your best to manage your timeline the closest possible way to what you want. You could ask A how much time you've got before giving your answer because you need some time to reflect and make your choice. Same goes for B if they make an offer. 

Uh, what? You are planning to try to shake down your employer for a bonus that has nothing to do with your work performance? Not a good idea. Sometimes an employer will re-negotiate a salary, especially if you were hired provisionally at a lower salary and you have subsequently proved your worth. If you are looking for a better position (which it sounds like you are), just go to the better job. Trying to extort your current employer or making threats like, pay more or I leave, will not accomplish anything positive. 

The problem is that there is an entire field called "Information Technology" or "IT" which is centered around networking. In most companies the development staff and the IT staff are completely separate. When you said you were specializing in "networking", the interviewer naturally assumed you wanted to go into IT and had been taking IT courses, not programming courses, so he lost interest.
