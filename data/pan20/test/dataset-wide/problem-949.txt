Alternatively, if your point data has a much higher resolution than the 1 degree grid, and if it is regularly spaced, you could simply take the mean of the points that lie in each cell. 2. Plotting that grid A naive method, which might be helpful as a quick check that what comes before has worked, would be, 

I think you have the right idea. Best to talk about UTC now; GMT is a poorly-defined historical term. One thing to beware of when doing the conversion : daylight saving. Do not make the mistake of assuming that it happens between the same dates everywhere! 

It is the movement of the air, rather than the air itself, that is referred to. It is thus reasonable to say that while air has mass and hence weight, wind does not. Whether dictionary definitions are important in the context and spirit of a riddle is, of course, up for debate :-) 

"Dirty air" : Not what it literally sounds like (that's also true in cities, but wind turbines don't mind). The wind that is funnelled through, around and above buildings is sometimes accelerated, but it is also made turbulent, and wind turbines do not like turbulent flow. Turbulence increases the unwanted forces that turbines experience (i.e. forces that do not help them make electricity), and makes them less efficient. Economies of scale: The amount of power that a wind turbine can generate, in a given wind speed, is proportional to the square of its diameter. Which is to say, size matters. In the countryside, onshore rotors commonly reach 80m diameter (offshore are much larger). In cities, this size would not be practical or acceptable. That means that a much larger number of turbines would be needed to generate as much power, which would be more expensive and have more visual impact. It isn't all that windy: The power that a turbine of a given diameter can generate is proportional to the cube of the wind speed. Because of this, small differences in wind speed are very important to wind farms. Most cities simply do not experience such high windspeeds as rural hilltops do. 

I suspect that the answers you seek lie as much in computer graphics and human perception as they do in physics or earth science - for example, colours on a cloudy day won't actually be significantly less saturated than on a sunny one - it's still white light to most intents and purposes - but we may perceive them that way due to the differences in contrast, illuminance, and colour. There are three components to natural light : You can calculate the angle of the sun according to time of year, time of day, and latitude. From this angle, and the altitude of your viewpoint, you can estimate the colour of the direct sunlight. The more air it has to travel through, the lower the colour temperature and the intensity. Then you need to consider the blue sky. This will be lighter at low altitude and darker at high. You'll need to do something about the sunwards sky not being blue at low sun angles. The blue sky casts light on things, but this is mostly only evident by shadows appearing a bit bluer than their surrounds. Then you need to consider cloud cover. For a flight sim this is complicated by the fact that it may be above or below the camera, or you might be in it. One approach might be to treat clouds as large diffusers that act on the light from the sun and from the blue sky. Whether this is feasible is beyond my ken, and definitely lies in the realm of computer graphics, not earth science. 

In a topological sense, if it's connected by an isthmus then it isn't an island. That doesn't mean that it might not be called that - but the answer is a cultural & political one, and hence won't adhere to strict definitions. 

Partial answer: after some further research: It looks as though the terminology that I am looking for is "Breakline". I need to define my coastlines as being breaklines. Now I need to figure out how to implement them in the languages that I am using, but that's probably a question for GIS.SE or Stackoverflow. 

Siting renewable energy generation in cities is very attractive, partly because many people feel that the "industrial" feel fits better there, but also because it locates sources of generation close to sources demand. For some other technologies, such as photovoltaics, this is indeed a good approach. However, it doesn't tend to work out that way for wind. There are three main disadvantages to urban wind: 

However, that will treat lon and lat as x and y coordinates on a rectilinear grid. To plot with a projection (N.B., WGS84 is not a projection. You'll need to figure out exactly what you're after with more clarity), you ideally want the Mapping Toolbox. I'm not an expert on that, but it should make projected plots relatively straightfoward. If you don't have access to the Mapping Toolbox, then you could spend a lot of time faffing with coordinate transforms to do what you want... but my advice would be to spend the time learning the basics of a GIS package instead (QGIS is free) and use that to do the job. 

This is perhaps more of a physics question than an earth science one. Thus, answering with the caveat that I am not a practicing physicist: Yes, it's possible. But it's VERY unlikely. Without doing the maths, I'm guessing "probably won't happen in the lifetime of the universe" unlikely. The reason for this is that there are a LOT of molecules in any macro-scale parcel of air, and a huge majority of them would all have to randomly move the same way at the same time. (plus, I'm guessing there are some Newton third-law, ie action & reaction, reasons why a spontaneous mass movement wouldn't really work) 

This answer was initially wrong. Thank you to mkennedy for pointing this out. I have now corrected it. Casey's answer is a good one with respect to interpreting a wind direction in general. However, you specifically asked about doing so on a UTM projected map, which implies that you're aware that in some projections, the direction of North on the page varies from point to point. This is indeed true for UTM. UTM is a transverse Mercator projection, which means that most lines of longitude follow curved paths on the projected map. However, UTM is used in narrow zones, as shown in the image in the question. The central meridian of each zone (the line running from north to south in its centre, which has an easting of 500,000m) aligns with a line of longitude, so "up" on the grid corresponds to north. Either side of this the angle of north will diverge, but so long as you are using the correct UTM zone, this divergence should be small (a maximum of about 3 degrees at high latitude at the edge of a zone, less otherwise). Therefore, for many purposes it is still useful to consider a wind direction as an angle on a UTM map. If greater precision is needed, then some calculation will be necessary - searching for "UTM grid declination" provides a few explanations of how to do this, although I think many are simplified. (I'm not qualified to go into detail on the maths)
