So how did France lose and lose so big? French leadership was trying to fix mistakes they had made in WWI and believed any new war would play out as the last war had. France expected a slow moving defensive war, while the Germans were strategizing for a war of mobility with integrated air, armor and infantry. In WWII french leadership had built the strongest fortifications ever which they deemed would give them a further edge in any war. Only the Germans bypassed the Maginot line and used a new tactic called Blitzkrieg which combined air, armor, and infantry in tandem to out maneuver their enemy. It's basically the same tactics the American general Shwartzkauf used in the first gulf war. This new type of warfare caught the French entirely off guard and they had no answer for it. 

The "city" was then captured by the Serbs also understandable as it was on their frontier and would have been a strategic port on the Aegean Sea, even threatening the Dardanelles. It was also on the Via Egnatia, an ancient Roman road which connected Albania to Turkey. Which also would have made it worth holding. [ The Ottomans simple had no reason to fortify a place in the middle of their empire. 

Trade unions have a certain influence over the economy and politics in each country and because they're organized in international organizations, their influence has a geopolitical dimension, too. After 1945, the Soviets and the communists had a lot of political capital due to the role of the USSR role in defeating Nazism. The Soviet Union was basically capable of replacing the (non-communist) International Federation of Trade Unions (which existed in 1919-1945 and had headquarters in Amsterdam) by the (pro-communist) World Federation of Trade Unions (whose headquarters were in Prague; after the fall of communism, the importance of this entity declined when communism ended and as a result, in 2006, the headquarters were moved from Prague to Athens). The Soviets and their sympathizers were able to promote their alternative views about the Marshall Plan and other things. This was dangerous from the American perspective. The U.S. and British trade unions would generally oppose the Soviet-led international organizations but the continental West European trade unions were somewhere in the middle. France was the ultimate "swing state" and CGC and Force Ouvriere were the French non-communist trade unions who opposed the Soviet line in the international organizations (the French CGT was a pro-communist example). That's why they got some funding from the U.S. At the end, in 1949, the (non-communist) International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (led mostly by the Americans and the British) separated from the Prague-based pro-communist international umbrella organization. However, the labor movement in Europe became so polarized that the entities were largely considered appendices of their political sponsors and the unions' importance decreased as a result. 

The following statement is my own conclusion and should be regarded as such: It would seem that America adopted baseball instead of cricket simply due to the fact that cricket was not established a "professional sport". The game continued to evolve and the many variants ended up leading to the game of baseball. By the time the evolution of the game caught up with the need/want of a professional sport baseball had the upper hand. EDIT: Who gets credit for baseball Also from the origins of baseball Link Congress has credited Alexander Cartwright (An American) as the inventor of baseball and he is honored in the Baseball Hall of Fame. But there are plenty of myths (See the Abner Doubleday Entry, as well as this quote) -From the origins of baseball page 

When reading about Operation DownFall I noticed that if Japan had not surrendered following the nuclear bombs at Hiroshima and Nagasaki there could have been at least 7 more Nuclear Bombs ready for the invasion. I am unable to find any information about the plans for these bombs or any plans regarding more bombs to be used before an invasion of Japan. With Operation Downfall being developed it seemed that there was thought that a few nuclear attacks would not force Japan to surrender. I was wondering if there is any information about other nuclear bomb targets, before, during, and after an invasion of Japan? 

The official story is that the inscription is taken from Jefferson’s Notes on the State of Virginia, with the last two sentences being from a letter to George Washington. A manuscript. The quote isn't some black-and-white assertion against slavery. Thomas Jefferson had complex and evolving relationships with slaves. He owned lots of them (inherited some 135 of them), had a romantic relationship with one of them after his wife died (including kids), waived various fees, and was the key politician who banned importation of new slaves and then slavery itself in numerous states. It's just wrong to assume that a politician in the late 18th century should have behaved and acted like a radical social justice warrior in the 21st century. There is no contradiction between Jefferson's life and the inscription and Jefferson was an amazing politician and president who has improved the U.S. society dramatically. 

Ancient Romans used the word Aethiops/Aethiopem which was derived from Greek Αἰθίοψ ‎(Aithíops). But the other answer isn't right when it says that the word Aithiops had no meaning except for the land of "Ethiopia". Instead, the word is a combination created from αἴθω ‎(aíthō, “burn”) + ὤψ ‎(ṓps, “face”). So the Greco-Roman word for the blacks was basically a "burned face". The name of "Ethiopia" was derived from "burned face". In the Greco-Roman world, "Ethiopia" was believed to include the whole non-Roman Africa. It was the universal word for that vaguely known part of the world. The idea that old nations didn't recognize races is absolutely preposterous from a historical viewpoint. On the contrary, it's just the last 30 years when it became fashionable for some people to deny races and their importance. This denial has absolutely no precedent in any historical epoch. The original meaning of Aethiops was purely racial. This is demonstrated by dozens of proverbs and important texts. For example, the Bible's Jeremiah 13:23 

As governor of New York FDR understood bold action was required. His policies which brought him the most attention were interventionist and thus consistent with his Presidential policies. FDR's approach contrasted Herbert Hoover who had the government passively running a surplus for 3 of his 4 years in office (1928, 1929, 1930) during the great Depression. As Governor of New York FDR: 

Hypatia's crime was she was smart, and an advisor to the Roman governor of Alexandria Orestes. Orestes was a Christian but he governed independently from the Church's bishop Cyril. When a disagreement arose between the two Cyril tried to assassinate the Roman Governor Orestes but failed. Next the Christians took aim at one of his primary advisor in their struggle, the Philosopher Hypatia. She was met on the streets by christians who dragged her out of her carriage and brutally murdered her within a nearby church. 

The "city" was sacked by Franks, Crusaders in 1204. because as it was on their rout to the holy lands and the ME. The Crusaders even sacked the Christian city of Constantinople that year. They didn't hold it long. 

Theodore G. Bilbo - former two term Governor of Mississippi(January 17, 1928 – January 19, 1932). And United States Senator (January 3, 1935 – August 21, 1947) Like many Southern Democrats of his era, Bilbo believed that black people were inferior; he defended segregation, and was a member of the Ku Klux Klan.. First Identified as a Klansman by a newspaper called the Dixie Demagogues, in 1939. He continued to win reelection to the US Senate through 1946, and died in office in 1947. When asked about whether he remained in the Klan in a national interview on Meet the Press in 1946, he responded. 

Due to the fact that the first published rules of baseball were written in 1845 by Alexander Cartwright the game of baseball (similar to the one we know) would not have existed during the colonial times and would not have been promoted anyway. Adoption of Cricket in America Source (also included a great timeline of colonial cricket The first recorded American Cricket match was in 1751 in New York and was popular among colonists before that time. However the Revolution came around and had an impact on all things British. From the timeline on the above linked page. 

As for the Roman Military they used a gladius you suggested as their main fighting tool. To back up my answer this site has pictures and summaries of roman weapons etc (None of which seem to resemble a scimitar). There are two types of these: The first being the original shorter Gladius Hispaniensis. The second being the more pointier Gladius Pompeianus The Roman Military was also outfitted with a Spatha which was a much longer sword. With neither of the swords in the picture resembling a gladius in my opinion the only option could be a spatha. A quote from the above linked site. 

That appears to me to be a US navy officers uniform (rank ensign). I found these examples from before and during WWI. 

Taney isn't saying slaves have no rights, he's discussing all black men. The compromise of 1850 along with the Dread Scott Supreme Court decision meant draconian change and helped radicalize the north in opposition mostly to the South; but also to what the South depended on which was slavery. The bill of rights(1791) didn't apply to slaves. But parts of the United States Constitution(1787) did. Specifically the Slave Clause, Article IV, Section 2, Clause 3. 

The United States would fight two wars with the Barbary Pirates. What was the long term ramifications of the United States tussle with the Barbary Pirates? Thomas Jefferson and the Democratic Republicans recognized the worth of a standing professional navy. Lots of tribute paid in the mean while. A great origin story of how we went from paying tribute to armed struggle. It wasn't a foreign policy derived in Washington but involving one of the really heroic block heads of American History... William Eaton. Eaton had run away from home at 16 to join the colonial army. He had risen to officer under Washington. Had made and lost a fortune. He had been a spy master for President Adams who had helped thwart a Spanish invasion of Georgia. Now Adams would send William Eaton a "Man of Action" on a diplomatic mission to Tunisia, to the Barbary Pirates where he would get in all sorts of trouble. 

By the time the Allies were set to enter Munich the city was already in shambles. It had been bombed a few times and an air battle occured over the city about a year prior. The city was ruined and was basically easily taken. According to this article a US soldier received his orders to enter Munich early in the morning on April 30th, 1945 and by 2PM he was standing on the central square and by the end of the day the city was for the most part captured (There was a pitched battle the next day at the Munich Airport). For a more in depth view see the section of the article called "Liberating a semi-deserted city" All in all this quote from the article sums up the capture of Munich 

Just to back up Wladimir's post of the inaccuracy of the numbers. Josh Howard a North Carolina Historian stated in this article 

North Carolina is only believed to have sacrificed the most men to the war. The article linked above is from 2010 where he set out to figure out if this was true or not. However as of now he has completed a study that attempts to put the myth to rest. Additional Info: Josh Howard's Study Page (No results listed) After a year+ of work it looks like he came to a conclusion. He states that the North Carolina death toll would be closer to 32000-35000. Also when taking into account the inaccuracy of other military records from other states it looks like North Carolina still comes out on top. From this article 

The question implicitly hides a misconception, namely the opinion that to succeed and establish policies, one needs a lot of "support", majorities in opinion polls, majorities in the Parliament, friendship of the media, and similar things. That's not how Otto von Bismarck did things. He used to have some connections to the old feudal order but was gradually losing their support. He was generally disliked by the public. He had to deal with hostility with Denmark, Austria, and France. He had no army backing him, no political party, and he controlled no seats in the Parliament. But he has defeated all these powers – the old order, public, working class, France, Italy, Denmark, and others – and prevailed. He was truly the first big skillful politician in the modern sense, one who knows how to switch between alliances and betray previous allies, and that's why he was also able to found the bureaucratic government of the modern type (which didn't depend on any previously recognized "power" or "class") – with all the aspects such as the welfare state and healthcare (that's how he bought a sufficient fraction of the working class and suppressed the influence of social democracy etc.) and many other things. 

Once freed a Gladiator would become a Rudiarius and would be given a rudis which was a wooden sword that symbolized their freedom. Some gladiators stayed near and with their rudis were able to take up training of other gladiators. Others were even offered coin to return to the arena. 

All in all it seems that due to the lack of evidence and the many many versions of this game it is very difficult to come to a solid conclusion. 

Extra Interesting Info: He did debunk the myth that the first casuality for the south was that of soldier from North Carolina. 

Cricket Cricket can be dated back to 1550 but games very similar to cricket had been developed in the 13th century. Baseball The following is excluding the myth that Abner Doubleday invented the game of baseball: Quoted from the baseball wikipedia page: 

The games of cricket and baseball are similar and can be looked at in an evolving type of way. Games similar to cricket were developed and the sport progressed as the rules and concepts changed. Over the course of hundreds of years the sport of baseball was created. To be correct Cricket may have not have even come first. See this reference to Rounders. There were other English games that went by similar rules to cricket and rounders. These games had many different names and variants. From Origins of Baseball
