This may be an overly cynical answer, and some may disagree with it. However, it's based on my 30 years of experience in a variety of different organizations of sizes from 6 to 15,000 employees. From time to time in your career, you're likely to run across people whose main function seems to be to act as a choke point or obstruction for everything that crosses their path. Quite often these individuals have no skills in their particular area of responsibility, or their skills have deteriorated to the point that they're no longer relevant. They know how to play the political games necessary to have power, though, and feel that they need to keep exercising that power to show how important they are. From a practical standpoint they only way that they can do this is to slow down, "advise" to a standstill, or otherwise derail everything that they touch. After all, if they don't have input, they must not be valuable, right? Managers and leaders like this tend to congregate in poorly-run organizations, and often feed off each other. This creates an interesting feedback loop where people that want to do the right thing get frustrated and leave, and people who don't care and are happy to play politics survive and advance. When you find yourself in such an organization, you have two choices: 

Think about the intersection between the requirements of the job and what you're good at. Pitch your skills accordingly. If there isn't much of an intersection, the job may not be for you. When answering questions like this one, try to focus on how you can benefit the organization and not the other way around. You want the hiring manager to see what you have to offer and to think about how you can contribute. 

There's nothing wrong with being unsure of what you want to do at the beginning of your career. When answering this type of question, there's no need to be too specific, especially in your situation. 

Why not do both? Explain the issue that keeps you from completing the exercise as it's written, and then provide an alternate approach that gives the same results. This will show that you understand the problem domain, and that you're experienced and flexible enough to determine the root cause and provide another solution. 

Does she look up and say "hi" to other people? If not, she may just be introverted (although this is an unusual quality in a receptionist). She may also be the type of person that gets lost in her own thoughts and may not be intentionally ignoring you. My advice would be to strike a middle ground by saying "hello" once in the morning (assuming the receptionist is not on the phone or otherwise occupied). It's not necessary to do so again that day. If do happen to make eye contact afterwards, just smile and nod. 

I think it makes the most sense for the student to take a medical leave from the co-op position. It sounds like there is a real risk of causing further injury or aggravating the situation if the co-op is put into a position where heavy lifting is necessary, or where there would be pressure (internally motivated or otherwise) to do the job normally. Depending on the situation, the student may be still be able to train a replacement if it's possible to do so without strenuous activity. This student has the next term to think about, not just this one. He/she would be well advised to rest and recuperate fully while it's possible to do so. 

If you're doing work that goes above and beyond the expectations for the position when you were hired, you certainly have the right to ask for a pay increase. There may be better options, though, than focusing on asking for more money. If you like the company and think you may have a future there, you could point out that you are doing work beyond your original expectations and ask that your review include a talk about your future career path, including aligning your title and responsibilities closer to the work that you're doing right now and adjusting salary accordingly. This lets the company know that you're not just interested in a pay rise; you want to manage your career over the long term, which is actually more important for a recent graduate. On the other hand, you think you will move on relatively quickly, it may be more beneficial to ask for an adjustment to your title than to angle for a pay rise. Asking for a title change to better reflect your responsibilities will indicate your value to future employers and may increase your income over the long term more than a pay rise at your current title. Bottom line - think about your long-term career path when review time comes around, rather than thinking only about short-term gain, and plan to focus the conversation accordingly. 

While this site tries to avoid giving specific career advice on an individual basis, here are some general suggestions that may be helpful from someone with 25+ years in IT: 

Personally I think it's better to say "mm-hmm" or something similar than to be completely quiet. It certainly does not offend me when someone else does this, and it shows that you're actively listening to the conversation. I'll often say "sure", "ok", etc at the appropriate times in this situation just to convey that yes, I'm still here and I understand the information that's being provided. 

Do you have any college references, e.g. a professor from one of your engineering classes? You're early enough in your career that it may still be helpful to list an instructor as a reference. Do you have any professional contacts in your area of expertise that work for other companies? If so, they may be good alternatives. If not, this is good time to think about beginning to grow your network. 

You worked for one company and did x different things. Unless you worked for teams that are widely known throughout your industry (e.g. the Gmail team or the XBox team), the fact that you did those things for different teams is probably only relevant to people within the company. I would list the company and then list the different types of work that you performed... simple as that. There's no need to mention the individual teams if you don't have a really good reason for doing so. 

How can you get your employees to see you as something other than a boss? You can't. Not while remaining a boss. You need to determine what is more important to you. If you want to advance in your career, make more money, have more responsibility, then you need to accept the fact that people will treat you differently. Your old peers are no longer your peers. Some will be more guarded around you, and some may try to take advantage of the situation by presuming that you'll overlook things that they're doing wrong, or they'll expect you to treat them differently (special privileges, etc.) because you had a previous "buddies" relationship. Those types of reactions are basic human nature; they transcend industry and culture, and you need to expect - and accept - that they will happen if you are moved to a supervisory position. It will then be your job to deal with them in a professional manner, which may not be the thing that some of your friends expect. If maintaining your existing relationships "as-is" is more important to you, you'll need to try to return to your previous position as @JoeT mentioned in his comment. Other alternatives are to find another job and maintain the friendships (which can be difficult) or keep the supervisory role and accept that some friendships may suffer. It's not fair to your friends or to your employer, though, to accept a supervisory role and then try to somehow act as if you're not a supervisor so that people won't treat you differently. That won't work; it will just confuse your direct reports and anger your management. 

I would take a slightly different approach to answer your question. Are you more comfortable in a large, bureaucratic organization that has defined policies for everything, and where you have a narrow role? Or are you more comfortable in a small organization that may not have as many written rules, and where you may be able to do many different things? If you don't like at least some regimentation, you're not comfortable at all with playing politics, or you have a very strong sense of ownership of your work, a small company may be a better fit for you. On the other hand, if you want to be more specialized, work within a larger framework, and/or you enjoy the political aspects of building your career, you may enjoy a larger company. Either way, you're likely to be happier - and thus more successful - at an organization that is a good fit for the way that you want to work. Don't worry quite so much about money at the start of your career. If you're in a good work environment and have the right opportunities for growth - ones that match your skills and interests, and that allow you to advance in an organization that you like - the money will come, and maybe sooner than you think. On the other hand, if you're in an organization that you can't stand, it's very difficult to advance (and taking on more responsibility in an environment that you dislike may not be attractive anyway). 

I feel qualified to answer this question as a long-time development manager who has partnered with marketing departments in four different organizations to build similar systems. That said, you may not like my answer, but it's one that you need to hear. This question does not appear to consider the needs of the business user at all. App development is not an end unto itself. If you're developing line-of-business apps, you're doing that to meet a business need. What you call "checklist-obsessed IT decision makers" are people that are trying to find solutions to specific business problems. They probably don't care overly about your dev team's personal preferences, and why should they? Put yourself in their shoes - would you care? From their perspective SharePoint may be "marketing-friendly". And they're the end user. Whose opinion matters more? Your question comes across as very condescending toward your client's Marketing and IT departments, and if you're approaching the engagement with this attitude, you're not going to make much progress. If you think the platform needs to be product X instead of product Y, and they seem to prefer product Y, you need to explain to them how it benefits them to choose product X. Maybe you think product X will be easier to maintain - to them that means that you can deliver new features more quickly. Sell that. You'll have much better success if you try to partner with your client's Marketing and IT departments to make the best decision and avoid the phrase "developer-friendly" altogether. 

If I understand this correctly, it appears that you are snooping through closed mailboxes without any permission or authorization from your management. In my opinion, this is misconduct equal to or greater than any of the perceived offenses that you mention. I'm assuming that you aren't privy to every conversation held by the HR manager. Maybe this person has approval to work with one or more outside individuals for purposes of document formatting and the like. Maybe the things that you view as a "breach of trust" are perfectly OK from the organization's standpoint. (I won't even get into the "asking others to do her job" comment.) The point that I'm trying to make is that you're trying to do someone else's job, and that you are commiting the same violations that you're trying to prevent (breach of trust, for example) in your own actions. Do not take this to management if you value your job, and by all means, stop snooping through email that doesn't belong to you unless you have specific written permission from your supervisor authorizing this. You may have access to sensitive information, but make no mistake, this does not automatically mean that you can look through it and act upon anything that you find. 

Adding to the already excellent answers, there is a concept of "paying your dues" that is applicable here. Management training is to management what reading a book about blacksmithing is to making a sword: helpful background information that may or may not be useful in the real world, and that people already familiar with the craft may or may not respect in the absence of other compelling evidence. An effective manager requires the respect of his/her team and the respect of other leaders within the organization. This type of respect comes largely through experience - progressive experience in a number of projects, most (but not necessarily all) successful. It may take more than five years of experience in your field to learn the basics needed to be really successful, to say nothing of the experience needed to guide and mentor others. If you want to work toward a management position, there is a lot of excellent advice here. Take full responsibility for the success of your projects, even in areas that aren't in your job description. Go above and beyond. Be an example for others. Be the person that everyone - on your team and elsewhere - looks to when they need to get things done. In other words, be a leader and leadership opportunities will naturally follow. Just understand that this is a journey - a process - and not a quantum leap. 

(NOTE: This answer assumes that you are entirely the victim of circumstances beyond your control and that you don't bear any responsibility for the outcomes in any of these positions. We'll set the likelihood of that aside for the time being, but of course this would be a good time for some self-reflection.) Robert Heinlein once said that the best way to lie is to tell just enough of the truth and then stop. I think that applies in your case. Your work history can and will be held against you. Anyone who compares you to a candidate with 3-4 years of employment in the same organization will likely see your job-hopping as a negative regardless of the reasons. However, you have a few alternatives: 1) Leave one of the jobs off your resume. This may be seen as dishonest by some people, but it could also be argued that your resume is understood to be a somewhat sanitized version of your employment record. It's easier to explain an abrupt departure from two jobs than three, and it's also easier to explain a six-month gap in employment than three jobs in 6 1/2 months. I'm not exactly recommending this approach, but if you decide to do this, the third job is the one to exclude. 2) Include all three jobs, but talk about your reasons for leaving only in vague terms. You could say, for example, that you had ethical concerns with your first employer (you did - not paying your employees on time is unethical), that your second employer was very pleased with your performance but laid you off after a short period (which appears to be what happened), and that the third employer was a bad cultural fit. In either case, there's no need to go into too much detail. The more detail you provide, the more you look like someone who habitually makes excuses instead of someone who has had a stretch of bad luck. 

What do you see as your skills? Maybe you're a people person. Maybe you're extremely organized. Maybe you're very creative. Maybe you're a natural leader. Whatever your skills are, you need to think about how they relate to this job opportunity and phrase your answer accordingly. For example, I'm fairly creative and enjoy big-picture work. I'm not really a "details" person. So my response in your situation might be to say "I'm looking for a position that can take advantage of my creativity and my skills in long-term planning. I'm open to any role where these skills would be valuable to the business." So, in summary:
