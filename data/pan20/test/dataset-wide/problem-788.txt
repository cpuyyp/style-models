In practice, images like this is made by using a grism which disperses the light according to its wavelength, together with a slit placed along the galactic plane, such that you block the light from the rest of the field. This is called slit spectroscopy, in contrast to "normal" spectroscopy where you block all light except for a little hole placed on some object (e.g. a star), or integral field spectroscopy, where you get the whole spectrum behind every pixel in an image. 

The figure was produced by calculating the frequency at a given time as $$ \nu(t) = \frac{160.4\,\mathrm{GHz}}{a}, $$ where $a$ runs from $1/1100$ to $4$, and calculating the age by integrating the Friedmann equation, assuming a Planck 2015 cosmology.

To further constrain the redshift, spectroscopic follow-up is needed. Since large amounts of neutral hydrogen is needed, this technique will tend to select massive, and hence rather evolved galaxies. Lyman alpha emitters (LAEs) When an electron decays from the first excited state to the ground state, a s-called Lyman alpha (Ly$\alpha$) photon is emitted. This can happen either when a hydrogen atom is perturbed (in a collision) and excited, or if hydrogen is ionised and recombines. Both mechanisms are at play when galaxies are born, where gas accretes onto a central potential (causing collisions), and young, massive star ionize the surrounding gas. Galaxies found from their ability to emit Ly$\alpha$ are called LAEs. They can be either found either spectroscopically — where are strong emission line will be seen at $\lambda = 1216$ Å — or photometrically by observing the field in a broadband and a narrowband centered at $\lambda = 1216$ Å and looking for excess flux in the narrowband. Since this techniques tends to probe young galaxies, they will often be relatively small, but with a high star formation rate. And because dust absorbs Ly$\alpha$ more easily than other wavelengths, LAEs tend to be rather dust-free. Sub-millimeter galaxies (SMGs) If a galaxy, on the other hand, is very dusty, it can be difficult to detect in the optical and, especially, in the ultraviolet. The reason is that dust has a strong preference to absorb light with shorter wavelengths. But the energy absorbed must go somewhere, and is thus emitted again, although at longer wavelengths, i.e. in the infrared and in the sub-mm region. Galaxies found this way are referred to as SMGs. Because it takes some time for the dust mass to build up, this technique tends to probe evolved, massive galaxies. Damped Lyman alpha absorbers (DLAs) The three techniques described above all have in common that they detect galaxies from their emission. A complimentary technique is looking for absorption features in the spectrum of a bright background source, e.g. a quasar. Because the light is redshifted on its way, especially hydrogen but also metals such as iron and magnesium produce absorption lines at various places in the spectrum corresponding to the wavelength that the quasar light has been redshifted to at a given point in space. Diffuse hydrogen filaments make narrow absorption line known as the Lyman $\alpha$ forest, and when a large pocket of gas is present — which indicates the presence of a galaxy — a broad ("damped") absorption line is produced. An example is seen in this spectrum of the quasar Q2348-011 lying at $z=3.0$. An intervening galaxy at $z=2.6$ causes the broad absorption at $\lambda\sim4400$ Å. 

"Spinning dust" is a mechanism proposed to explain a particular feature in the foreground emission of CMB; a bump around $\nu\sim20\,\mathrm{GHz}$. Dust grains acquire charge through photoelectric emission and collisions with electrons and ions (Draine & Lazarian 1998). As zephyr comments, if the dust is a poor conductor, its charges will, in general, be unevenly distributed, causing small dust grains to exhibit an electric dipole moment $\mathbf{\mu}$. But the molecules making up the grains may themselves have a dipole moment, and even a perfect conductor will, in general, have its charge centroid displaced from the mass centroid (Purcell 1975). Collisions and radiation may cause the grains to start spinning, and in the presence of magnetic fields (which are very common in the interstellar medium), this spin in turn causes the particles to emit radiation with a power $P$, according to Larmor's formula which for a rotating dipole can be written as: $$ P = \frac{2}{3} \frac{\mu_\perp^2 \omega^4}{c^3}. $$ Here $\mu_\perp$ is the component of $\mu$ perpendicular to the rotation axis, $\omega$ is the angular frequency of the rotation, and $c$ is the speed of light. The emitted radiation matches the rotation frequency which lies in the (tens of) GHz-region, corresponding to wavelengths in the microwave region. In contrast, the radiation from non-spinning dust will be thermal, thus lying in the infrared. The paper you link to (Bennett et al. 2013) shows the difference in Fig. 22 (although thermal radiation peaks outside the observational range of WMAP): The spinning dust peaks around $\nu\sim20\,\mathrm{GHz}$, while the thermal radiation peaks around $\nu\sim2\,000\,\mathrm{GHz}$. 

The solid line shows the HMF today in the local Universe, i.e. at redshift zero, while the dashed and dotted line shows how it was at redshift 1.6 and 2.1, respectively, roughly 10 billion years ago, which mark the beginning and end of the wall (according to Horváth et al. 2014, A&A, 561, L12). Notice how the number of large halos grow with time, at the expense of small halos. This is due to the smaller ones accreting onto larger ones. The HMFs are characterized by a power law at low masses with an exponential cut-off at high masses. To get the total number density we need to integrate over the entire range of masses, and here comes the problem: Whereas the upper limit is set by the maximum size a galaxy can have (roughly $3\times10^{13}M_\odot$, but the exact number isn't very important, as these galaxies are so rare), the lower limit depends on your definition of a galaxy. Large galaxies have smaller galaxies orbiting as satellites, and there isn't a well-defined threshold for when a clump of gas, stars, and dark matter is called a galaxy. These guys report on the detection of a $\sim10^3M_\odot$ clump which they call a galaxy. That's probably not what you think of as a galaxy, so for the sake of this exercise, let's use Small Magellanic Cloud-sized galaxies as our lower minimum, i.e $\sim 6.5\times10^9 M_\odot$. The total number density of galaxies is thus found by integrating the HMF. Luckily, the online HMF tool can do that as well. The result, i.e. the number density of halos above a given mass, looks like this: 

You're right that in principle we cannot know if the distant galaxies are still receding from us. When, however, we think that they indeed are, it hinges on the cosmological principle, viz. that the Universe is homogeneous and isotropic, i.e. "looks the same everywhere and in all directions". This is a philosophically motivated statement, which is continuously tested observationally. So far, there has been no significant experimental evidence that this is not correct. When we observe the velocities of galaxies throughout the Universe, we see a smooth velocity as a function of time, or distance, with some intrinsic scatter which is due to the gaalxies' peculiar motion, i.e. their velocities through space, which is usually of the order of 100–1000 km/s. That is, distant galaxies move away from us fast, and nearby galaxies move away from us slowly. As you say, the expansion rate decreased with time, but only until a certain point, after which it started increasing again (due to dark energy). The fact that we see that nearby galaxies are still receding, together with the cosmological principle, implies that the distant galaxies should also still be receding. We know of no reason that they shouldn't. Of course this is no proof, but in physics, there are no proofs, only verifications and falsifications. To postulate that the distant galaxies no longer recede, and to be taken seriously, you would need to come up with an experiment that could verify this hypothesis, preferably along with a mechanism that would be able to cause this phenomenon (this looks a bit condescending when I type it; this is not my intention). The expansion rate is currently — and hence locally — around $70\,\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$. Due to the aforementioned velocity scatter, we cannot probe expansion below ~1 Mpc, but at this scale, space doesn't really expand anyway due to the mutual gravitational attraction of the Local Group. This means that in principle, the expansion of the Universe could have come to a halt within the last few million years, and still be in accord with the cosmological priciple. However, this would mean that the evolution of expansion velocity as a function of time would have a sharp kink. Again, this is not impossible, but we know of no physical mechanism which would be able to cause this.
