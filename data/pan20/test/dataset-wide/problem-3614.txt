I don't see any immediate problems with it. But it sure is a lot of volume. Make sure you can properly recover from it. There's some programs I'd consider an excellent step up from a linear progression on a beginner program, like SL 5x5, that could be a good prep for going towards higher volume and specific goals. The Texas Method is a great template that will allow for continued progress in strength gains as an intermediate while leaving room for customization. I've also done Candito's Linear Program which is great for novices (and I did it in that context) but felt like it would make a great graduation from a simpler program into intermediate territory. His 6-week program might also be a good fit. Maybe doing one of those for a brief period would make for a smooth transition into PPL. For balancing a program, a good point was made on aworkoutroutine.com (good blog with a common sense, no-nonsense approach). It stated that creating a balanced routine should try to achieve similar total reps on opposite movements. So if, say, you do 3 sets of 5 reps for bench, then somewhere in the program there should be 3 sets of 5 reps for rows. See about totals for each major movement pattern and how they add up compared to each other. That could give you a good idea. Now, this does depend on goals. If you're going for a bodybuilding approach and feel specific areas of your body need more work, then that's going to skew some volume. But a balanced physique is still a good thing to have and over time would naturally result from a balanced program. Good call on the chalk. Have you tried a hook grip on the deadlifts yet? Also, if grip starts becoming a limiting factor, straps might be useful. You obviously don't want to use them all the time so grip can become stronger, but there's no need to let that one component hold you back from the benefits of progressing on the deads. 

The bulk managed to put you into intermediate level. After the cut you've dropped back a bit into novice but you're still stronger overall. Now, this isn't the whole story of course. The real question is: had linear progression on your bulk stalled to the point that adding weight to the bar on at least a two-weekly basis didn't work anymore? No longer being capable of linear progression, and no longer being able to fully recuperate between successive workouts without some sort of periodization are signs you'd no longer be a novice. Because your strength dropped a bit on the cut, you can probably maintain linear progression again for a while. But I think your approach could have some problems: 

Am I getting this right that you could get the medium on tighter, but the jump in prong holes just isn't as convenient as where you sat with the lever? Of have you actually run out of holes on the medium? Unless I'm mistaken (someone correct me if so) the hole spacing for lever and prong should be the same. So if it's a matter of sitting somewhere in the middle between two holes, it's due to a slightly different offset with the lever. Maybe you'd be better of with the lever then anyway. If it's a matter of the medium being too big, a smaller size should do the trick. I'd be really surprised if the suitable sizes don't overlap. There should be some surplus holes. They list them as distinct intervals on the site but I think that's just to find out which size category you fall into depending on measurements. So if you're at the inner limit of a medium you'd probably fit comfortably in small, regardless of some variations depending on meals and progress. Contact your vendor or Inzer to see about replacing the belt with a smaller size and maybe use the opportunity to get more precise info from them about what would fit you best. I bet they get these questions all the time. EDIT: oh yeah, I forgot. You could also go for the Inzer PR belt which has a ratchet for being able to adjust as finely as you want, and I suppose a ratchet could be made really tight. But it costs a lot more than the prong or lever belts. 

This means there's 10 grams of carbs consisting of (5 grams of) sugar and probably some starches, and on top of that there's 3 grams of fiber. In MFP your entry now needs to look like this: 

Currently I'm doing 3 workouts per week: Monday, Wednseday, Friday. There's two workout templates, A and B, which simply alternate. It's basically the StrongLifts 5x5 and Starting Strength approach. All workouts have squats, and until now the deadlift was on workout A (so one week there'd be two deadlift sessions, the other week one). The deadlift is only done for one work set after warm-up. Thus far, the weight on the squats was increased every workout. The plan was to turn Wednesday into a lighter back-off day for the squats once recovering started getting heavy, and at that point also do only one deadlift session per week. Since I'm feeling some lingering back stiffness from workout to workout, and progressing on the squats and deadlifts is getting increasingly difficult, now seems like a good time. The question then is, which day would be best to put the deadlifts on? I can either put it on one of the heavy squat days (Monday/Friday) or on the lighter squat day (Wednesday). There's advantages and disadvantages to every choice. 

First of all, BCAAs are branched-chain amino acids, and amino acids are the building blocks for protein. Your body can get amino acids from protein sources by catabolism just fine. Eat good protein sources, eat varied and supplement only as needed. Paying a premium for things that are needlessly complex (such as whey isolate instead of simple concentrate) rarely makes sense. 

Let's first take a look at what seems to influence (base) metabolic rate the most. For starters, when we look across species, there appears to be a neat relation between the average mass of a subject in that species and its metabolic rate. A linear relation, in fact, between the metabolic rate and body mass to the power of 3/4. This is known as Kleiber's law. The slope varies a bit among single-celled organisms and cold- and warm-blooded animals, but in general the relation holds within each group. Given that metabolic rate scales with body mass among animals, perhaps it isn't far-fetched to expect it also will for subjects within a species, including humans. Here is a fascinating study digging into what correlates with basal metabolic rate (BMR) for people: $URL$ (Factors influencing variation in basal metabolic rate include fat-free mass, fat mass, age, and circulating thyroxine but not sex, circulating leptin, or triiodothyronine1,2,3; The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition). Within-subject effects, meaning within the same person, accounted for a variability of only 2%, with 0.5% being analytic error. Of more interest are the between-subject effects, looking at what are the best predictors for BMR. We find the following percentages for explaining BMR: 

My tip is... see a doctor. And if you did and they didn't really find anything, consider a second opinion. Really, there are so many possible causes of this that just giving you some tips is unlikely to solve it. And because the underlying cause might be a serious issue, it would be irresponsible of me or anyone who isn't a health professional to give you advice. The only things I can think of personally is that you do weight lifting and the stress you impose exceeds your capacity for recovery, or you're lifting very heavy relative to your conditioning. Recovery occurs mostly during sleep. I've noticed that when doing serious workouts frequently I might need as much as 10 hours to feel rested. But you mentioned increasing the weight only after a few weeks (a beginner is capable of increasing weekly or even every workout) so I doubt that is it. Maybe the hormones aren't sufficient to counter the hypothyroidism. Only consider the above paragraph if you've ruled out anything more serious, which requires a professional medical opinion. 

Just like how spot reduction is generally considered impossible, so is the other way around: gaining fat to specific areas without the others. For muscles, it's a different story. Muscular adaptation will occur mostly where necessary, meaning targeted exercise can enhance a particular region. At any rate, diet will play a critical role in weight loss, weight gain, muscular hypertrophy and muscle retention. As they say, "you can't outrun your fork". Before you are too skeptical about me suggesting strength-based programs and exercises, that you'd typically see the big burly men do in the gym, know that these will work just as well for a woman. In fact, they'll work better than anything else. Shy away from anything that uses the term "toning" or the women's magazines that can only sell copies by repeatedly coming up with new stuff that doesn't work. The basics have been established for ages and don't change, but they can't go printing the same articles every month, now can they? You will not become she-Hulk or some scary-looking bodybuilder. With much lower levels of testosterone as men, women simply don't have the raw capacity for packing on muscle as men have. I've been training my butt off with a strength focus for 15 months now and look nowhere near what I'd like, and I'm a guy. You won't wake up one day and find "oh my, I've become too muscular". The big compound lifts, with a focus on linear progression for strength as a beginner, will provide the best progress you can get. 

When people describe a feeling in limbs as "tingling" or "pins and needles", they're usually talking about the phenomenon known as paresthesia: $URL$ If you check the causes section of that article, you see there's countless things that can lead to this. When it comes to exercise, some things coming to mind are 

Finding precise studies seems to be hard, but I think we might be dealing with two factors: psychological and physiological. On a psychological level, there is habit formation. Taking an extract from Wikipedia: 

That's right, a video game. It's called Dance Dance Revolution or DDR for short. The game consist of stepping on arrows in four directions according to instructions on the screen, on the rhythm of music. There's various difficulties, ranging from extremely easy to outrageously hard. Once you get past the absolute beginner stage, which happens quite fast with some practice and tips, the more energetic songs are gonna leave you sweating. It is my favourite form of cardio and I tend to push my heart rate and total calories burned in one session higher than through jogging or even swimming. Fortunately you don't have to find an arcade where they have a machine. There's dance pads available for home use. A powered USB hub is often recommended because they tend to draw a lot of power. There's flat, sheet-like pads that I don't recommend, pads with foam in them that can be very decent, and more expensive high-end stuff that'll last ages. I've got a bunch of the foam-filled ones that have been on duty for some years and still work fine. I put heavy books around them to keep them from sliding around. For playing on your computer, there's a program called StepMania which is free and open-source, and you can find an almost inexhaustible supply of songs to play around the web. Why do I like DDR so much as cardio? First of all, it's intense, but not non-stop. You play a song, typically around 2 minutes in length, then take a breather while you select the next one. You can play it right at home, no need to even get out. You're playing a game, so it's entertainment. You get to know new music. You'll want to constantly improve to make it on songs of a higher level. There's a warnings too. This tends to be high-impact so don't overdo it, it's heavy on the knees and hips. Some of my problems with these are at least in part to being a bit too eager when I just started playing DDR. With a bit of technique in footing you can minimize this, though. As far as interesting cardio goes, you can't beat this in my opinion, unless you really get into a sport and want to push yourself technically. But actually, that's what DDR does for me. 

Doing all of these will be good for general conditioning and endurance. But for building strength and mass, not so much. That adaptation requires progress, which can take these forms: 

There isn't enough information to go on, such as, did your eating disorder consist of overeating or undereating? If you're at the same weight as you used to be but you believe you look fatter, it is possible body composition changed and lean body mass was lost. But it is also very likely you might have body dysmorphia and pay an inordinate amount of attention to minor changes, or seeing changes where there are none. Increasing caloric intake can quickly lead to some changes since replenishing glycogen and glucose retains more water. Simply ignore this. Things will stabilize where they need to be over time with the right caloric intake and exercise levels. One thing I can say for sure is that if you continue to eat such low amounts of calories each day, you will encounter health issues. Cultivate a better body image. Eating so little each day must be exhausting; that work can be applied towards something you can take pride in and is actually healthy. 

What you're actually asking about is "recovery". The term "rest time" usually applies to the time between sets within a workout. For example, if you'd do several sets of squats, you might rest anywhere between 2 to 5 minutes or even more depending on the intensity between those sets. Mark Rippetoe likes to underline in his works (Starting Strength, Practical Programming for Strength Training) that strength and muscle are not built by lifting weights, but by recovering from lifting weights. The weight lifting constitutes a stress to the body which forces an adaptation. Initially, after the stress is applied, there's a period of reduced performance, during which your body is recovering. At that point performance is below the original baseline. As recovery completes, supercompensation occurs: in order to guard itself against a repetition of the stress the body adapts, increasing strength through muscle hypertrophy and other mechanisms. Performance now rises above the original baseline. If the stress is not repeated, detraining starts to occur and a return to the original baseline begins. Here is a diagram showing this effect. 

From this study, the highest mean activity is to be found in the captain's chair exercise (also known as power tower or knee raise station) and the bicycle crunch maneuver, which exceed the other activities rather dramatically on the rectus abdominis. There has also been some tests done by Bret Contreras, who looked at a larger number of exercises, but did all tests himself meaning there's far less data points to extrapolate from. Here is the article: $URL$ The conclusion here was that chin-ups, hanging leg raises and the ab wheel had the highest mean activity for the rectus abdominis, ab wheel (from feet and from knees) and body saw for internal obliques and ab wheel (from feet), hanging leg raises and bodysaw for external obliques. As you can see there doesn't seem to be a consensus amongst there articles, although I'd say the actual study would be the most reliable. The hanging leg raise and captain's chair are very similar and an excellent workout provided you focus on using your abdominal muscles and not just the hip flexors. From the data it seems like the reverse crunch (raising your legs) is a better option than the traditional crunch (especially for the obliques), and leg raises or captain's chair an all-around superior option. Now as for upper/lower muscle groups, the Wikipedia article claims that a crunch with the arms stretched out over your head (effectively lengthening the moment arm) will result in increased activation of the upper abs, although I'm a bit wary of the reference. The Bret Contreras article references previous tests of his that claim that different exercises do vary between the ratio of upper/lower ab recruitment. A study referenced in this article shows activation of lower and upper rectus abdominis: $URL$ There are big differences between the general activation for various exercises but insignificant differences between upper and lower ab activation. All in all, there doesn't appear to be much evidence that exercise choice will greatly affect upper/lower activity ratio, but there is evidence that there's a big difference between exercises in general utility. EDIT: I've done some more digging and am going to have to revise my above answer. I've found two studies (which are very similar) that deal with this question:
