First step is - every communication you do with MM must be mirrored straight to RV weather she is interested to listen. If she doesn't give you time to hear, keep it through email medium. Speak to RV about your work goals. Instead of just focusing the discussion on what work MM is giving you, ask what plans she (RV) has about next line of work you are going to do. If RV has a clear idea what you are supposed to be doing, and if those projects are really critical, then the phase you are going through is likely to end in future. If RV doesn't have much clue about what will you do, or feeding you with stop-gap work items, you are surely under practical supervision of MM only. Speak to the higher up (bosses of MM and RV) as to what do they expect from you. The possibilities can be one of the 3. a. if they are not aware, and want you to work under RV only, they might help you out by taking some action. b. they may the plan of this transition phase only and assure you to have proper path after the handover. If they are specific in what they say, trust them and don't worry. c. If they are vague in their answer or just try to pacify you and expect you to help MM whenever required - that only implies you don't have much respite, at least in immediate future. Talk to HR - independent of seniors. Expect more "politically correct" answers from HR anyway. HR will most likely assure you that things are going to be smooth but in many organisations where HR is not very empowered, this may not be of help. The crux you need to check is if there is slightest contradiction between the senior's view and HR's promise. if version of HR is fully in sync with version of seniors - it is a case where everyone is in the loop and they have a plan for good transit. If HR's view contradicts to that of what senior's told you - both or at least one of them is fooling you. You are in trouble then. Last but not the least. Speak about your problem to colleagues you trust. How common do you see these type of issue in your organisation - is this common or frequent if not widespread? Is this at least common in your department? Is this common to people who are working or have worked under MM? - if so what happened to them? 

Ideally no good organisation would put you in a situation you are in. And hence, if you raise your voice in front of the right people in right manner, you must be able to resolve it. Yet, in many companies, if people like MM are powerful or they run key functions - management might blink the eye for their misdoings. If that is the case, you may never come out of this. What should you do if you find out that MM is going to be your practical boss. OR worse what if you find out that 'both MM and RV' is going to be your boss? Well, choice goes back to what you want from your career. 

Focus on outcome not on timeline or size of effort. Now this is much trickier than you think. Many a times in work - we may find better/easier ways of getting things done. Quite often we realise after the whole thing after it is done. Yet, it is not surprising at all and not bad that you find a better way than your boss thought. If indeed, you got some better way to work - first consult back to your boss and tell him/her your way and how it will be easy. There many possibilities here: 

In essence, you should focus on the what outcome is desirable for you and direct your boss towards it rather than making it appear that you are unhappy about it. EXTRA You might not get help always. Sometimes bosses are just not in a situation to help you - and are forced to push you towards jobs what you don't like -it can be business reason, financial reason or even HR reason. But if you think your boss is helpless, you would be better off finding another place than to fight! 

When you talk to a recruiter in the interview, your "Excellent Verbal Skill" will be essentially visible. In jobs such as Sales, engineering - this has implications only to an extent of connecting to customers or peers. But mostly your qualification matters the most here. In many cases like Call centers it becomes important to be extremely well spoken, but in that case those folks either have their own test or training during job. In case of literary oriented jobs Such as news reporting etc. again they have very different expectations and evaluate you accordingly. In all, the recruiter knows what they are looking for and will evaluate it depending on the critical need of job. So external certificates, course are good for improving yourself but unless it is visible in how you present yourself in the interview, and that skill is visible, it isn't really a big deal to put up a score. 

getting them to know overall elements of the system and how they work, getting then to appreciate a general process that goes in development of such systems. when you are stuck in some problem, you need to give them some background and how you are planning to solve them. They should also know what remains essentially straight forward but common situation and what remains essentially non-solvable problems. 

Resume where you are listing your projects or key results - there won't be much about this part of the job. Also, generally "learning a lot through reading" is usually not placed much in resume unless you have gained practical work experience in that area. (it's ok to put Java as part of skill set). However, when you are putting down the chronology of companies you have been to, it is very essential that you do not omit any organization attended. Usually, a period like 3 weeks one could ignore when evaluating and no one will come to know about it; however, if they come to know about this relation during ref check - it leaves a bad remark as to why you hide this fact. And during interviews where one would ask you why did you changed so quickly? If you had genuine reasons to leave people wont mind it. But in the above stated situation no one might cross check with you. You might be at loss. 

So you are killing your relationship with CompanyA almost immediately while there is only a small hope to remain connected to CompanyB (which might still take more than couple of project at least. Also, you are turning companyA as your competitor. So it is not truly unprofessional, it does imply betrayal - specially if you are yourself a one project company. In general, you can take a step like this, over time, but only when you are largely recognized as an independent name by yourself and if and only if companyB make an offer if they think that companyA is not adding value in the chain! 

Get them to reality. I think they do understand the reality, but just that they don't want to accept it. Simple ways are to stick to detailed data, charts and so on. Stick to that as much as possible from authentic sources rather than your own perception. Only when you continuously supply the relevant data they will come to know. Stop fighting to improve quality. Most often, when it is known that there is no feasibility for additional investments - people don't quite admit problem, instead they try to push other way. What they really want may be is how to maximize quality out of what we have (a legitimate and better management objective) than how to get to the next level where business is easier to do. Always bring up issues in open forum - objectively and agenda by agenda. When you want to be a change - you cann't really bring everything turn around in one day. Start winning small battle one at a time. Object on specific points and prove your point only in that scope. Slowly, people will begin to appreciate. Cut across the cynicism. When you know something is wrong - look for what should have been a better way to do it and how to improve it than just duck out by putting blame and move on! Most of the time other side refuses to accept simply because they are only avoiding the blame part of it. Do something innovative. So many management books will write about innovation - but when the real life gives us opportunity we all look down upon. May be now you will say "innovation in our industry? not possible!" But that's where you are wrong. Just take a break and make consciously think something unusual. Some of the first ideas will go very bad straight - but if you keep up the thinking you will finally hit somewhere.
