Is this an accurate description of what Descartes said? If yes, what does it mean that mathematical theorems can be changed? I don't understand why, if he thinks that laws of nature are fixed with respect to God, mathematical theorems are not? Aren't mathematics more basic than laws of nature? For example, isn't "one plus one makes two" more basic or unchangeable than the fact that things with mass pull each other? 

European colonialism in Asia and Africa last well into the modern age. Most Asian countries only became independent after WW II, and Most African nations became independent only in the 1950's and 1960's. That is way after the enlightenment, after the French Revolution (liberty, equality, ..) and after the likes of Locke, Kant and Hobbes. My limited understanding of those thinkers is that the legitimacy of government come from social contracts, consent of the governed, democracy - government as the agent of the governed, and freedom. These all seem to contradict the legitimacy of colonial governments, which exploit foreign nation for their advantage by the force of arms. Divine rights and natural law might be used to justify colonialism, but after the enlightenment it seems that these theories are obsolete. What are the common philosophical justifications of colonialism in the 19th and 20th century? How did they address the lack of consent, freedom and democratic rights of the governed? 

The student forces a false dilemma (and false dichotomy) on you, as Dan Bron suggests. You feel you are in a dilemma: either you have to make slides available in advance, which you don't want to (it appears to me), or you might be viewed as a bad lecturer by the student who sent you the email. Luckily you are not in the dilemma because the student's reasoning is based on false dichotomy. 

Of course, humans are influenced by their senses! I eat because I am hungry. So let’s set aside actions that are non-voluntary. I think what you are trying to say then is that we do not seem to be motivated to act by reason alone. Many times we are motivated to act by factors like passions (desires, emotions). The question then is what is the motivation for us to act: is it reason or is it passion? Philosophers in moral psychology have tried to answer this question. Presently, the question has divided them into Humeans and non-Humeans. As you can see by the name, David Hume’s idea ended up generating a new field in ethics. So what is Hume’s idea? Hume argued that reason alone can never be a motive to any voluntary action, that reason can never oppose passions, and that reason in fact is the slave of the passions. Hume's idea could sound “Duh” to non-philosophers. But among philosophers, Hume’s idea was revolutionary. The reason was that philosophers up until Hume had been indoctrinated by the Socratic teaching that all we need for action is reason. Under the Socratic’ teaching , we discover moral knowledge through reason, and once we have the knowledge, it is impossible for us to act in any other way than what the knowledge dictates us to do. Moral knowledge has the power to move us. For this reason, under the teaching, in the struggle between passion and reason, reason must have the dominion over passions. By contrast, Hume argued that reason cannot move us. Reason is to discover knowledge. Whether scientific or moral, knowledge cannot motivate us to act. If they did, Humeans retort, why people holding the same (moral) knowledge act differently? The debate on who is the master and who is the slave continues. 

Imagine these two thoughts experiments The first one, slightly modified from "Jim and the Indians" by Bernard Williams: You come upon twenty people taken hostage by an armed group. The groups's leader tells you that they are going to kill all but one designated hostage. However, they make you an offer that if you kill that one person (with a weapon that they supply) and they will let the rest go. Will you accept the offer? Note: this is slightly different from William's original setup that if you don't take the offer, one hostage will still be alive. Second one, from 7:25 in this video about utilitarianism: You are a doctor and you have 5 patients waiting for, respectively, a heart transplant, a lung transplant, a liver transplant, and two patients needing a kidney each. If they don't get the transplant, they will die soon. You don't have such organ available, but you have an option of killing another healthy person (who happens to be a donor match for all these patients) and taking that poor guy's organ for the 5 patients. It seems that both experiments are equivalent, they are the case of killing one life by one own's hand vs letting many die by refusing to kill. If we go by strict utilitarianism, one should go for the option with less people ending up dead (i.e. killing one person), or if we go by strict Kantianism, one should not kill, so one should refuse the offer in the first experiment and let the patients die in the second. But, intuitively, it seems to me that taking the armed group's offer is somewhat more ethical than killing someone to harvest organs. Are there philosophical differences between these two experiments? Or does it only feel different to me because of some non-philosophical factor (e.g. the way the experiment is packaged, the different in my subjective emotional response, etc.)? 

What could you be able to know about this cube? Suppose now a sphere is introduced. Is there anything you would learn about the cube (positively), by the introduction of the sphere, that you could not have previously known about the cube? (for example, could you, by the existence of a cube alone learn the concept of an edge, corner, number (amount of edges that a cube has)). Or do you need another object so you would be able to distinguish characteristics and so learn properties of the objects? *( I am not merely talking about negative attributes of a cube, such as: it is not round, but rather things like: it is straight). (perhaps an additional question related, do you need negative attributes in order to be able to assert positive attributes) *The answer given to this question would determine whether or not everything that is knowable about an object depends on other objects, or whether everything about an object can be known be simply studying that object. (This is what I mean by epistemological potential). *The question is about what you COULD know, not necessarily what you would actually know in such a situation. 

As Mr.Johnson correctly points out, your very first assumption (there is a scientific model capable of explaining any physical phenomena) is unwarranted. Laplace's Demon asserts that, if he knows the momentum and position of each and every particle in the universe, he can predict the past and the future as if they are unfolding presently, with his unbound computation capacity. 

You posit that the culpable actions of an individual make the individual forfeit her basic rights. You ask what would be the name of the moral principle equivalent to your posit. The harm principle and the retributive principle suggested by Dwarf and Oke, respectively, might be adequate in many situations of criminal justice, but they have narrow applicability. The harm principle for instance does not address the question of who is at fault. If a man wielding a knife tries to kill you, and you try to save your life by attacking him back, the man with the knife could appeal to the harm principle, arguing that your counter-attack harms him. Clearly, we want a moral principle that does not allow the man with the knife to appeal to the harm principle since our intuition is that harming others in self-defense is morally permissible. The needed principle that incorporates culpability in harm calculation is called the fault-forfeit-first principle. That is, the faulty or culpable person forfeits her rights first, and thus she may not counter-attack the counter-attack of an innocent person. The guiding idea of the principle was extensively investigated by Judith Thomson in her paper entitled "Self-defense," although I think Richard Arneson is the one who coined the name, the fault-forfeit-first principle. Arneson defines the principle as follows: "when a predicament arises where someone is going to be killed, it is morally better that, of the parties involved, the one who is seriously culpable or blameworthy in some way should be killed rather than people who are fully innocent.” The principle is mainly appealed to in the paradigm of just war theories. 

My question is actually this: What does the question: "what is the purpose of meaning" mean? Questions that may arise in answering this question may include: What kinds of things can have purpose? (and is meaning such a thing). 

First off: What is the definition of a logical possibility? My personal suggestion is this: A logical possibility is a proposition in which multiple terms are connected in such a way that the proposition does not contain a contradiction. (A blue square, or a non-blue square, where blue is a term and is connected to the term square. This proposition does not include a contradiction and thus is a logical possibility. Contrary to square hexagon.) Would this be a correct definition of a logical possibility? (I.e. does it contain too much or eliminate too much?) To say that something is possible in this view would just mean that it is non-contradictory. Secondly: Is it possible that a term does not necessarily exist? For example is it necessary that the idea, which constitutes a term, of a "white house" "is/exists" in some way? Or is the "being/existence" of the idea contingent? Thirdly: If a logical possibility is indeed defined as the connection of terms that does not lead to a contradiction. And there "exists/are" terms which are not necessary but instead contingent. (And not eternal) Would the existence of some logical possibilities then not also be contingent? (And not eternal) 

Pascal's decision is based on the Bayesian decision theory which states that the rational course of action is the one that leads to the maximal expected utility. Pascal thus concludes that he should believe in God since believing in God offers infinite utility over not believing in God. I do not see any fallacy in his reasoning. If one rejects Pascal's conclusion, she must be regarding any of the above assumptions as unwarranted. But believing that the assumptions are false does not mean that the reasoning is fallacious. That is, if we accept the paradigm of the Christian God, and if accept all the assumptions (including the Bayesian method), one must accept the conclusion. With this, I respond to the claim that Pascal's argument is fallacious, following Conifold's suggestion, due to committing the fallacy of bifurcation. So the fallacy must lie in either Pascal 1 or Pascal 2. Pascal 1 is a tautology. So the fallacy should be in Pascal 2. Indeed Conifold seems to assert that Pascal 2 is a false dichotomy since there are other possible gods that Pascal neglects to consider to believe in. But considering other possible gods are irrelevant to Pascal's question, which is whether he should or should not believe in this particular God presented to him. The situation is similar to the case whether I should or should not love this woman. If Conifold points out to me that I neglected to consider all other possible women I could love, then surely Conifold is missing the question that I am asking. The existence of other women is irrelevant to my question since my question is whether I should or should not love this particular woman. For this reason, Pascal 2 does not commit the fallacy.
