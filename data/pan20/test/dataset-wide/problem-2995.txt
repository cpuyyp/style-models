According to Gnostic religious wisdom and traditional science, the prevalent modern infatuation with quantity both in real life -- as in love for material wealth and the craze for technological innovation --, and also in modern scientific tendency -- as a desire to understand and explain everything by reducing it to numerical terms -- is an essential characteristic of the current (and last) phase of the historical cycle of manifestation of the transcendental principle, a phase called Kali-Yoga in Hinduism, and termed as Akhar uz-Zamaan (The End of Time) in Islam and former Abrahamic religions. The era is marked by sociopolitical disorder, moral decline and corruption as direct consequence of increasing preoccupation with the lowermost manifestation of the transcendental all-inclusive one being who unites all qualities (God) that ends and fully descends in the divisive quantitative material plane of existence that is devoid of any quality and substance. This will be a prevalent cultural characteristic of our time embraced by the majority until the phase will come into its inevitable exhaustive end (marked by among others global frustration at the state of the things), a turning point from when on the universal ascent towards the transcendental principle will manifest itself in a resurgence of public interest in qualitative virtues and uniting transcendental truth. Other than conditions associated with the fateful and frustrating phase exhaustion, the transition will be also facilitated by inspiration from a minority of men of esoteric wisdom who carry and spread the traditional and gnostic sciences during the era. But the transition will be ultimately led, guided and the ensuing global order finally established by a human being who himself unites in his self all qualitative virtues and has a full affinity with the one supreme principle, hence he himself is only one person who contains all truth, a whole reflection of the all-inclusive principle of existence (or God in religious terms). This messianic leader is identified as ‘Mahdi’ in Islamic End of Time literature and whose equivalent exists in Hindu and other ancient religions. So you have a dilemma to choose between what is now only a temporary popular trend or what is now an unpopular but a destined prevailing guidance in future, of course, if you can understand and comprehend the esoteric wisdom behind this worldview, for which I recommend you The Reign of Quantity by Rene Guenon which discusses this topic in detail and depth. You may ultimately choose to join theology, religion or anthropology departments in the West where esoteric wisdom and philosophy can be officially studied. 

First off, it should be pointed out that the process of self-awareness you are describing is also experienced by human young. I believe we all get to experience that at some point in the age of 3 when we realize the influence of our thoughts over our behavior. Experiences such as "Mommy! I thought you went out!" can sooner or later guide the child towards introspective thinking. Yet, I believe that relatively advanced level of realization is not the only experience that can be generally described as self-awareness. It can be reasonably argued, as does Rex Ker, it is hard to sharply distinguish between primal instinct and self-awareness as both phenomena generally suggest an "awareness" of external and even internal stimulus by the subject. A cat responds to the internal feeling of hunger and that suggests his is "aware" of its emotions but a cat doesn't seem to be ever able of critical introspection where a living thing contemplates upon its thoughts. So considering that we humans do go beyond that primitive level of self-awareness, it is very intuitive that different levels of self-awareness emerge at different levels of the evolutionary process yet not all animals reach such advanced levels of self-consciousness as do human beings. Now going back to the challenge of distinguishing different levels of self-awareness, it seems that the object of awareness is the real criteria for distinguishing different levels of self-awareness. Well, you might immediately respond that the object of awareness in self-awareness is evidently the "self", yet as in the cat's hunger example we learned that self-awareness is actually applied to an associate of the cat's self which was the feeling of hunger as experienced by the cat's self. So I think the question rests fundamentally upon our full understanding of the nature of the conscious substance of living organisms including human beings. I, as an adherent to holistic theory of Mulla Sadra about the nature, origin, and development of human bodily and mental existence, believe that human self (or highest substance) just like every other living organism is a non-material being that interacts closely with his physical organs. Yet the multiplicity and compoundedness of his external physical existence introduces various kinds of perceptions to the non-material substance varying from primal instincts of hunger and lust, to external sensory perceptions (visual, audible, etc), mental abstractions and logical judgements thereupon which allows a wide and varied spectrum of further abstract conceptions and complex logical judgements. Under this light, depending upon which particular set of perceptions (ranging from sensory and abstract perceptions to judgements and propositions) we predicate awareness upon, we get different levels/types of self-awareness as all types of perceptions become part of a living organism's self. Therefore, "I am angry" is as much indicative of self-awareness as is "There's a car out there", "I think Earth is round" and "2 + 2 makes 4" as they all indicate an awareness of a fact which is ultimately reflected in the subject's existence, as all of the prepositions can be preceded by "I am aware that..." So we can reasonably say that all awareness of conscious living organisms are also self-awareness. But as an example as to how we proceed from the most elementary (primal) instincts to higher levels of consciousness let's trace different stages of the mental development of a new-born baby. When a baby first sucks upon her mother's breast, he is already aware of the existence of his lips (notice, that he still doesn't have a sense of the shape, proportion and other properties of his lips doesn't negate the fact he does sense their existence). And since he senses them as part of his existence, his self, that very primal instinct does qualify for a primitive level of self-awareness. Taking the example further, the baby gradually establishes a relation between the perception of satisfaction (lack of hunger) after lactation and the perception of sucking on the mother's breast, and as a result craves for mother's hug once he is hungry again. That's how the child gradually arrives at such mental abstract categories (although not yet very articulate and vivid) as food (sensed as something that eliminates hunger, i.e. mother's breast), food-source (mother's breast or hug), eating (the act of sucking). These vague more abstract concepts are reinforced upon the recurrence of similar experiences and later in the child's mental development come to be associated with visual images of the mother and her breast, and later with oral words such as "mommy", "breast", "food", "milk", "hug" and their respective referents and meanings, and as such lingual capabilities gradually evolve. This introduces a higher level of self-awareness, that is, awareness of the most primitive abstract categorizations of immediately sensory percepts, all sensed by the subject's self. Reinforced senses of "me" and "others" on one hand, and reinforced concepts of existence and non-existence, cause, effect, etc on the other gradually enable the child to arrive at more philosophical questions or statements such as "Where did I come from?", "Why does apple fall?" etc. This is the stage where mental development can generate a myriad of new concepts, statements, questions etc and it is difficult to point out in particular what concepts and statements the child arrives at from this point forward, yet it can be safely said that since the child has already developed a strong sense of "me" and "other" enabling him to utter various first person sentences, the notion of self-awareness as recognition of the existence and impacts of thoughts is very likely already established. This wisdom reveals that human self-awareness (which corresponds to his very mental substance) is constantly expanded as he acquires more knowledge of the world around him. Though, the knowledge absorbed, formed or arrived at can be divided into various types (i.e. primal, sensory, rational and spiritual) each with a particular impact on the subject's existence. And in the meantime, it was also revealed that self-awareness is not passed from one living creature to the other, but it is a capability that separately evolves throughout mental development each individual conscious living being goes through. 

As a Muslim (and a theist student of philosophy after all), I recall an interesting Quranic verse which suggests something very similar but with an additional qualifier: "You will never attain goodness until you give out in charity from things you like!" And I'm gonna take this as the starting point of a rather long metaphysical contemplation of the question! Grand thesis What does the last qualifier suggest? I think it is there to rule out those acts of charity which are not selfless and self-disinterested. Because ultimately it is the things that we like (or our interests) that determine our true motives. So if you give out in charity for any other purpose than doing good to a fellow human being, for example if you do that for the purpose of wining popularity etc, then that's not an act motivated by true moral incentives (regardless of particular benefits rendered to the recipient). In our religious traditions, this is condemned as "hypocrisy" which however can affect any "good deed." But this thesis already poses a number of challenges. How can we be convinced and motivated to do something that in no way benefits us personally even if in the sense of a moral satisfaction about our own personality? Other than this realistic "selfish" objection, one could also say if morality is fundamentally about goodness (distinct from acts of goodness as its extension), what justifies depriving one individual (that is ourselves) to benefit another? An intermediate solution could be that in charity the person giving out and the person taking it are not equal in terms of their life satisfaction or wealth. It is the haves that should give out to the have-nots. But this notion already presumes justice and equality as imperative, principles that entail some sort of redistribution of good which involves people relinquishing (either by force of law or consent) obtained interests for the deserving others. Here one can argue that moderation of justice assumes that some interests have been obtained immorally at the cost of others (i.e. the havenots) so justice only restores the rights. But one can't deny that even interests obtained "immorally" still benefit the illegal owner. Hence the dichotomy stands. And there's a still a more radical form of charity that completely negates self-interest, that is acts of total sacrifice, like one person risking his life to save someone else from fatal danger. So how do we resolve the realistic conflict between parties' interests that morality as generally understood entails? I my view only religion can at least reasonably claim to hold the keys to these challenges based on its premises. When you do an act of good you are actually participating in the perfect goodness of God. So in some sense you're just projecting an existing ontological goodness, (essentially distinct from particular instances of worldly interests), on the fellow humans who are less-benefited by the goodness of God! But by doing so, even though you seem to be doing a moral sacrifice which is nonetheless true in appearance, you're in (ontological) reality not! Since participating in Divine goodness, enhances your own personal goodness (with you being an immortal soul) so self-benefit as a realistic basis for morality is also realized. Hence morality is not in reality the unjustifiable drop of good to be picked by another, with that understood in terms of quantitative discrete distribution of things, but rather multiplying an existing good towards others enabled by the infinite goodness of God endlessly supplying the moral acts! Hence goodness is not distributed discretely so as to result in conflict of interest. "But all of this sound just pure religious rhetoric!" Could be, but regardless of our personal beliefs about religion, only religion seems to put forward a solution that is at least internally coherent and practically realistic. But to those with ever a religious experience the above wisdom is deeply intuitive and hence immediately verifiable! Now going to your particular question, I can elaborate further the potency of the above thesis to address difficulties in moral debate. Answer I argued that essence of morality is not charity but rather goodness with goodness being an ontological reality embracing us all (but let's just forget about the problem of evil for now if it is occurring your mind. We just want to show how well the thesis works regardless of other theological problems). And charity is an act of extending, multiplying goodness to/for others. When the above is established, on can then hardly determine when charity is "enough". Participating in infinite goodness allows for extending goodness indefinitely (although not infinitely since we are all mortal and practically restricted in doing so by our internal and external circumstances). But what then dictates how much charity we give out? The extend to which we have personally realized goodness! That is only so far as we have actualized goodness in ourselves we can extend it to others! This explains why there are those human angels and saints who can surprise us with their "unending" generosity and why there are villans who can't do but bad! Are we then hypocrites? We are hypocrites to the extend that claim to be good without having an internally realized goodness necessary for supporting the envisioned act of goodness! That is without a realized goodness, engaging in charity is an impossibility. If it seems otherwise then we can be sure that there are profane selfish motives disguised under generous pretensions with the remarkable consequence that goodness is not actually multiplied, hence the hypocrite having to extract goodness from somewhere else to compensate the relinquished good! This is a feature of all "profane" hypocritical acts of goodness! (Profane is meant to mark the ontological dynamics behind what religions actually suggest with the concept. It is never meant as to dismiss acts of good by the non-religious). As for the question of duties to close ones. An important note first: Duties are only conventions aimed at enforcing a minimum degree of participation in the infinite good as deemed by the law-giver (state or religious law) for individuals! Hence saints don't define their "duties" by the conventions for general humanity. They pour out goodness so large as their deep participation in the absolute goodness enables them! But they also do it wisely, not to waste it! What this means would take another post of this length so let's move on! Now should we value those closer to us? Practically there are "good" arguments for this ruling as well as ontologically (since no practically feasible convention is without underlying ontological reasons)! Families and relatives are areas of our worldly existence where perfect goodness has already manifested itself most prominently hence they are areas that are essentially more conductive for further participation and projection of the perfect goodness! Hence religions encourage you to start charity, care and benevolence from your close ones, the neighbors and then the strangers! Families are the loci from where the good garden of humanity should blossom and populate! Peace!
