This is intended to be a partial answer. I hope more knowledgeable people will answer. Apart from asserting that $\exists \phi(\mathbf{x}) =\mathbf{y}$ the implicit function theorem also asserts \begin{equation} D \phi(\mathbf{x}) = - \left(\frac{\partial U}{\partial \mathbf{y}} \left( \begin{array}{c} x\\ \phi(\mathbf{x}) \\\end{array} \right) \right)^{-1}\left( \frac{\partial U}{\partial \mathbf{x}} \left( \begin{array}{c} x\\ \phi(\mathbf{x}) \\\end{array} \right) \right) \end{equation} in this case that corresponds to $$\frac{d \phi(x)}{dx} = - \left(\frac{1}{y}\right)^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = -\frac{y}{x}$$ so thus $$ \frac{dy}{dx}= -\frac{y}{x}$$ This shows that the definition of $MRS$ follows from the Implicit Function Theorem. EDIT 1: Consider $$ dy = - (U_y)^{-1} U_x dx$$ which we agree follows from the implicit function theorem. Then by multiplying both sides by $U_y$ and rearranging we have \begin{align*} U_y dy &= -U_x dx \\ U_x dx + U_y dy &= 0 \end{align*} and thus by the definition of a differential, $$ U_x dx + U_y dy = 0 = dU$$ so this is also a consequence of the implicit function theorem. This can also be seen trivially since $U = 0$, then by the definition of a differential, $dU =0$. 

Yeah the argument can be made in that on one end you've got a perfectly competitive structure, especially in the long run, while on the other end you've got a pure monopoly (single firm), and then you've got the two in between in the form of monopolistic competition and oligopoly. Your example could be reasonably justified, as an oligopoly by definition is a structure where a small no. of firms having a big share of the market. Therefore when their share of the market decreases, they will no longer have sufficient market concentration ration to exercise the various oligopolistic actions, such as tacit collusion, upon the market. In the short run, however, it can be argued that the spectrum is less obvious, as even firms in perfectly competitive markets can make short term abnormal profit. 

I have seen sources that claim high interest rates increase the velocity of money circulation, but haven't really seen any concrete explanation for this. This is how I think it works: High interest rates -> high opportunity cost of holding money -> Demand for money decreases -> people dont want to hold money and will spend it -> higher velocity of income. On the other hand,wouldn't a high interest rate make saving more attractive and thus reducing the velocity of income circulation? EDIT: Sources that apparently claim this are referred to below: This source does not explicitly state the relationship but somewhat explains the causes: $URL$ A wikipedia page that seems reasonably credible states this relationship, but I am unable to fully understand their explanation: $URL$ This exam question from Cambridge International Examinations that explicitly states the relationship (the correct answer is D) 

I have seen the capital transition equation take two forms $$K_{t+1} = sY_t +(1-\delta) K_t $$ $$\dot{K}_t = sY_t - \delta K_t$$ Obviously I can rewrite the top one to get $$K_{t+1} - K_t = sY_t - \delta K_t $$ So that suggests somehow $$\dot{K}_t \equiv K_{t+1}-K_t$$ But as far as I know, $$\dot{K}_t \equiv \frac{\partial K_t}{\partial t} = \lim_{h\rightarrow 0} \frac{K_{t+h} - K_t}{h}$$ which is, as far as I know, not the same as $K_{t+1}-K_t$. my question Is $$\dot{K}_t \equiv K_{t+1}-K_t$$ right? If so, what does this mean and why isn't it the usual derivative? 

I'd like to have a mathematical version of the following two definitions just because I remember symbols better than words. But I lack the math prowess to convert them from words to symbols. Can someone assist me? Def 1: A feasible allocation is weakly Pareto-optimal if there is no alternative (feasible) allocation such that everyone prefers the alternative to the original. Def 2: A feasible allocation is strongly Pareto-optimal if there is no alternative (feasible) allocation such that at least one person prefersthe alternative, and everyone else is indifferent. 

I'm sure it's one of the three, as they were commonly repeated when I did some research on the internet, but can't quite make out which one it is. 

The money market diagram showing liquidity preference and money supply intersect at an equilibrium level of interest rate, but what interest rate is it? Is it the base rate (I presume this is the rate at which commercial banks lend out loans to borrowers) or FED Funds Rate/LIBOR? Or does it simply refer to interest rates in general? 

I'm aware of the concept of the multiplier effect, and when I think about it, shouldn't it be possible that government spending on unemployment benefits create a multiplier effect? 

According to some lecture notes, apparently it is possible for the economy to return to long run equilibrium if via the self-correcting mechanism if there is a temporary shock to the stick wage (horizontal) SRAS. I believe the situation can be graphed as below (SRAS shifting to SRAS1). The problem is I don't see an explanation as to how it will return to long run equilibrium ($Y_f$), other than to let labour markets adjust itself over long periods of time?? 

Consider the Ramsey-Cass-Koopmans model in discrete time. Specifically, consider the following phase diagram. 

Suppose I have two markets, Home and Foreign. Suppose that $$\frac{p_1}{p_2} = \frac{c_2^F}{c_1^F}$$ $$\frac{p_1}{p_2} = \frac{c_2^H}{c_1^H}$$ Supposedly I am supposed to be able to show $$\frac{p_1}{p_2} = \frac{c_2^F + c_2^H}{c_1^F+ c_1^H}$$ But by rules of simple algebra, it would seem $$\frac{p_1}{p_2} = \frac{c_2^Fc_1^H+c_1^Fc_2^H}{2c_1^Fc_1^H}$$ MY QUESTION: What step am I missing to get $$\frac{p_1}{p_2} = \frac{c_2^F + c_2^H}{c_1^F+ c_1^H}$$ ? 

Suppose I have two teachers: Adam and Bob. Suppose Adam takes 20 hours to lecture and 30 hours to grade, while Bob takes 100 hours to lecture and 60 hours to grade. In absolute terms, Adam is clearly a better teacher because he does the same work in less time. But supposedly they could still benefit from trade and specialization of labor. Why does only relative price and not absolute price matter in international trade models? 

Since unemployment benefit is a form of government spending, which is a component of aggregate expenditure, then shouldn't unemployment benefits be part of national income measurement? 

According to this question below, apparently a reduction in the regional differences in the level of unemployment would shift the short run Phillips curve SRPC leftwards. The answer to the question is A). I do not see how this could be the case, because "a reduction in the regional differences in the level of unemployment" could mean the regions could either all experience more unemployment, or could all experience less unemployment. I don't see how either scenario would affect the expectation for inflation (in this question it would seem to be a deflationary expectation) to result in a leftwards shift in the SRPC. 

Supply shifts from S to S1, which leads to price rising from P to P1 and quantity exchanged dropping from Q to Q1. Recall the formula for total revenue TR=Price*Quantity, so in the diagram the initial revenue level is OPBQ, and after the tax is OP1AQ1. The change in revenue will depend on the size of the tax and the size of the decrease in quantity consumed. Producer surplus is zero both before and after the tax, while consumer surplus decreases from CBP to CAP1. 

$$AC(q) = \frac {C(q)}{q}$$ $$MC(q) = \frac{\partial C(q)}{\partial q}$$ These are the definitions. But I don't understand what the difference is. Is the average cost the cost per unit while the marginal cost is about infinitesimals? 

and I was supposed to use the scarcity axiom. But what does it mean to show this claim is false? The principle of scarcity is just that "resources are scarce". That's not mathematical. How can I prove the above statement is false using it? My Question: How can I tell when a question requires a proof versus merely conceptual reasoning / explaining? What is the difference between the two? 

I am told a quasilinear utility function is a function like $$U(x,y) = \sqrt{x}+y$$ My Question: Can someone provide a real world example of a quasilinear utility function? 

These are points my mates and I are arguing about as we prepare for our midterm. Also, I prefer rigorous answers so if you can, feel free to be as thorough as you want. 

The only possible explanation I can think of is that in the second fiscal year, the government continues to spend, but this time it spends less while not changing tax revenue ("In the absence of offsetting factors"), hence the MS still grows but the following fiscal year's deficit has reduced. 

When it comes to non-private debt, I hear these three terms the most, but I am not sure if they're interchangeable or discernible. Also, are they recorded in the balance of payments? I'm guessing if they are, they'd be recorded in the transfers part of the current account and the capital and financial accounts. I understand that this is a duplicate question, but my previous question had no contributions other than my own, so I figure it would be sensible to repeat it. 

My understanding is that wage differentials should not exist in a perfect labour market for occupations, but the following exam question seems to imply that this can be the case. A brief marking scheme also implies this. 

Suppose I have the following Cobb-Douglas function $$U(x,y) = x^\alpha y^{1-\alpha} = 1$$ where $\alpha \in [0,1]$. $$MRS = -\frac{U_x}{U_y} = - \frac{\alpha}{1-\alpha} \frac{y}{x} $$ $$\frac{\partial MRS}{\partial \alpha} = -\frac{1}{(1-\alpha)^2}\frac{y}{x}$$ So suppose I have the following set of graphs: 

My professor said, in practice, Marshallian demand follows the law of demand (ie that increase in price decreases demand). But he said in theory, the Marshallian case is ambiguous and it does not follow the law of demand. MY QUESTION: Why isn't the Law of Demand true for Marshallian demand? 

What is the difference between constant elasticity of substitution and elasticity of substitution? Are these formulas related? How are they different concepts? I just did a whole problem set involving these and got the right answers. But my thought process was all math. I don't feel like I understand them economically. And that's what I want explained. By CES, I mean $$U(x,y) = A \left(\alpha x^{-\rho} + (1-\alpha) y^{-\rho}\right)^{-\frac{1}{\rho}}$$ By ES, I mean $$\sigma = \frac{\mathrm{d}\log \left(\frac{x}{y}\right)}{\mathrm{d}\log \left(\frac{U_y}{U_x}\right)}$$ 

I need verification on my understanding as to whether the following factors affect the demand for money, and if so how they affect it: Changes in Nominal National Income: will affect the transactions motive for money because changes in this will change the amount of money demanded in the economy as more/less will be demanded to buy more/fewer goods and services (shifts the liquidity preference (LP) schedule). Will have little effect on the precautionary motive if nominal national income increases, but the effect may be greater if nominal national income decreases. Changes in nominal national income may change the demand for government bonds (the main asset in focus of the Keynesian model, I presume) and may therefore change the speculative motive of the demand for money as well. Changes in the level of inflation: higher inflation may require a higher demand for money. Changes in the interest rates: results in movements along the liquidity preference curve. The effect is typically stronger on the speculative motive for demanding money. Changes in overall outlook in the economy: a negative outlook may depress speculative spending which may increase the demand for money. I believe these are the main reasons, and would like a verification as to whether what I've written is accurate.
