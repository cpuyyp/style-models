There's nothing to be gained by raising this in an interview with them. Any answer you get from them will be about as far from objective as you can get - if they tell you the company is great you won't have any way of knowing if they are telling you the truth, even if they hate the company and spend every waking moment fantasizing about burning the place to the ground the fact remains that they are still working there and therefore have nothing to gain by bad mouthing the company to a virtual stranger and quite a lot to lose. If they tell you the company is bad to work for then that tells you more about them then it does about the company - someone unprofessional enough to say that sort of thing as an interviewer probably doesn't have good professional judgement and their opinion should be taken with a whole sackful of salt anyway. So either way you still don't have any information you can really act upon and you risk coming across as a negative person to them by asking in the first place so I would highly recommend against doing this. 

As @Kaz says in the comments all the previous moves are understandable and justifiable, sure that many moves close together isn't an ideal "look" but they aren't horrible by any means. Based on what you told us leaving your current contract now would be hard to justify to another organisation and would definitely look bad. And even worse is that to someone who doesn't know you the other moves being acceptable relies on a certain amount of "benefit of the doubt" being applied - leaving a fixed term contract half way through as you propose could well remove that benefit of the doubt and actually paint the previous moves in a negative light as well exacerbating the problem, so my advice would be to tough it out in the current role and fulfill the contract term. Then you will have a completely reasonable set of circumstances to explain it ending. 

The list could go on, but hopefully one can see that most of these have at least some negative connotations. Why is this person unemployed? Why do they feel unchallenged, and would they feel unchallenged in the job we are offering? What is the source of the conflict? None of these are going to be viewed as positives. Active also insinuates that you are talking to many potential employers. This could help your ability to negotiate, but you only need two potential buyers to drive up price. If companies feel they have a low chance of hiring you due to other suitors being involved, how much are they going to invest in you during the interview process? One could say they are actively seeking better opportunities, but the word active just creates an unnecessary issue. Say that you are not actively looking to leave your job but are keeping an ear open to new opportunities, and go on to say what intrigued you about the opportunity being discussed in the interview. 

The math could expose that your current package isn't as great as you think if you go into great detail. Let's say estimated work hours are 40 hours at the new company but 60 at your current firm. If the company making the offer is wise, they will factor all this in. If there is an area that the new company outshines the old, particularly in a hard to quantify area. Example: Your current employer is publicly held, but the new firm is offering you stock options in a private firm, that is hard to quantify and could expose your feelings about the company (if you put little value in those options, it could be construed as a lack of faith in the firm). Opportunity is another. If your current firm is not growing but the company making the offer is expanding, how do you put a dollar value on opportunity to grow? Once you put a dollar figure on your current overall package and the offer being made, you still need to find middle ground on what a reasonable increase is (or whether you would take a lateral). 

NB: I'm not going to look at whether they are questions you should be asking at all - at the end of the day if they are things that matter to you and would influence whether you would take the job then that's what's important here. An interview process is a two-way thing. So assuming you do indeed end up with a non-technical person interviewing you, and there has been no indication about whether you will have an interview with someone who is at any point in the process then instead of trying to ask the HR person these things directly or trying to ask questions they might be able to answer and trying to puzzle out the answers from there you are instead much better off asking them this: 

It doesn't sound like an excuse or blaming anything - and most people reading that will understand that it accounts for one of those inconvenient periods of thumb twiddling that come along with dealing with large bureaucracies. 

I'd probably steer clear of this area unless it feels natural in the conversation - if she's asking about an example of your adaptability or overcoming a challenge or something along those lines. Otherwise you are making an implicit criticism of her and that's not a good tactic for getting someone onside! If you do discuss it then at all costs avoid saying "you advertised the position incorrectly", and where possible avoid negative connotations like "incorrectly", instead refer to the position as being "different from what you expected before starting" 

I think the key here is 'considering'. If the parties who scheduled the interview were absolutely aware that these interviewers were active candidates for the job, or if they were aware that these interviewers were even considering throwing their hats into the ring, then I would expect they would/should not be involved in the process. This is also assuming that the company has a large enough number of employees to choose from for the interview panel. At a smaller company, there may be few options. As others have mentioned, going to HR is another option. Depending on the size of the company, you may want to be careful about that, as you may be seen as someone who is 'telling' on your competitors before anything has even happened. If the other candidates have not come forward yet and you only know they are considering applying from personal conversations, I'd be careful with what you say at this point. Good luck! 

What are you not certain about? You say both offer and company are good, so you need to decide what exactly you are waiting for in the job search. Of course something better could always come around, but will it? Some candidates do not want to take the first job offer given (using the 'don't buy the first car you test drive' theory), but what if that offer is indeed the best? 

You then dig the e-mail out and forward it over to them or show on your screen, whichever is more appropriate. The advantages of this approach are: 

When given an unrealistic (or indeed an impossible) deadline for completion of a task there are three key aspects to communicating this back to the person assigning you the task: Promptness You need to let people know as soon as you can that the deadline is unlikely to be met, the more notice you give people the more time they will have to work around the problem. Whether that is managing expectations with the project stakeholders, acquiring additional resource, adjusting the task etc. And of course the is the likelihood that not mentioning you're going to miss the deadline till the last minute (or later!) comes across as an excuse rather than a real problem and that won't reflect well on you. Clarity You need to communicate the issues and the consequences very clearly and in language that the recipient understands. I'm not throwing rocks at you here but as an example your question as posted here is very difficult to navigate which makes identifying the cruical message you are trying to convey that much harder and opens up the possibility for it to be missed or misinterpreted which could be disasterous in such a situation. Especially in a busy work environment where the PM (or whoever) may have very limited time and bandwidth to spend on deciphering it. Don't just bring problems, bring solutions Just telling someone 

Sounds like your best option would probably be to find a shop of like-minded engineers and work with them. If you, as a very new developer, are noticing his company's tech issues already, I'd imagine the issues run deep and are systemic and cultural. As a young engineer, don't be too discouraged by this. It's your first job, and although there are other groups like this, there are plenty that are more friendly to engineers like you. You mentioned that you are able to pick up new languages and APIs readily, so finding new work shouldn't take too long. Lots of companies seem to be doing more hiring in the junior level range as of late, so your freshness to the industry is a potential advantage. If your career is the main concern, even taking a small paycut to work in an environment that rewards learning and your type of thinking would be wise in the long run. Learning is the most important element of any job for you at this point in your career, and the money will come if you learn your craft well. 

As a general rule of thumb, the larger the company you are being hired by, the more likely that this check will be done. Most small companies seem satisfied with standard reference checks from peers or former managers, but are not as concerned with an official notice from a former employer. Large companies with more processes in place are very likely to confirm employment dates with your most recent employers. Assuming that you represented your past employment accurately, the outcome would be that you have nothing to worry about. If you misrepresented your background, you will probably see an offer taken back. Where this becomes tricky is that a candidate would not want a new employer to contact his/her current employer before an offer is accepted conditionally, yet if the check is done and is not to the satisfaction of the new employer, you could be left in a very difficult situation (no new job, and having to explain to your current employer about interviewing for and accepting a new job). 

Do you feel that you aren't getting sufficient training? Or is it a lack of recognition? Both can be valid concerns but these are things that are between you and the company, not you and the PM and you should be addressing such concerns with your manager. The PM is not responsible for you or your career development - their job is to get the project completed according to the requirements of the business. 

Cheques are valid for 6 months in Canda I believe, and the sort of timeframe you are talking about (<1 month) isn't outrageous, I highly doubt they will even notice. On the off chance they mention it I'd just reply commenting that you haven't gotten around to it yet because of the logistics of getting to your bank. 

Given that e-mail addresses aren't generally considered confidential information the chances are pretty high that people won't really think twice about it, especially in the case of predictably formatted addresses such as those used by many companies. Of course if they do think about then you risk them considering it to be a bit awkward or even a little bit creepy if the address wasn't in a predictable format and I really can't see any potential advantage you could gain from deliberately doing it this way. If you want to send a thank you note to someone ask them for their e-mail address, if you don't have it send a note to your contact and ask to have it forwarded on. And no this will gain you precisely zero "hacker" credibility, cybersecurity position or not. 

Recruiter here. When I coach candidates on salary negotiation, I always tell them that they are free to speak to the client directly about compensation if they want, but to keep in mind that any number they throw out puts a relatively hard cap on what I can get you. If you list 70K as your desired salary, chances are they will offer a bit less (sometimes, but rarely more), and it will be difficult for me to ask for 73 at that point. Assuming you are not working with a recruiter, you don't have an intermediary or an agent in your negotiations other than yourself. Some of the examples above about insurance contribution being higher than expected or 401k or target bonus being lower than expected are possibilities. Being offered less vacation time that you currently have or than you expected is also an easy one, as vacation days have a quantifiable value (to spitball some numbers, there are 52 weeks x 5 = 260 weekdays/year, subtract say 10 holidays = 250 working days a year, so every 5 day week you work = 2% of salary). The example about commute distance could make you look a bit unprofessional, as in most situations you probably knew the location of the job before you interviewed and applied for it. The other examples about asking for more bonus, extra vacation time, or to change the 401k vesting schedule are not entirely realistic in most cases. Larger companies will probably laugh at the suggestion, small companies may be able to accommodate bonus or vacation but probably not changing a 401k schedule. One valid reason that some candidates will give to increase the requested compensation is a higher responsibility level or work expectation than you expected. Companies will know that if you apply for a job with say no leadership role and they ask you to lead a team, you may want to be compensated for that responsibility.
