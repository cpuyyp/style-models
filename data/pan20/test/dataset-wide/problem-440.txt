Having escaped Isengard and left Rivendell, we are off to destroy the Ring. Our first stop--Khazad-dum, known contemporarily as "Moria". Being a Dwarvish kingdom, the problems I see with Moria are identical to those with Erebor in The Hobbit. Hollowing out a small piece of a mountain to build a mine is no big deal, but the dwarves have hollowed out the entire mountain to build a kingdom. In real life, that would be turning Everest, the second-tallest mountain in the world (if only Mauna Kea weren't an iceberg), as hollow as a discarded snail shell. In real life, such things would have the following problems: 

The cold, windswept grasslands of Tibet. Despite the vast height differences between the Tibetan Plateau and the mountains of western North America, the environmental hardships are similar. So, should a chance in evolutionary history arise, could a species of bristlecone, or any other species of slow-growing, long-living coniferous tree, take root on Tibet? 

So I somehow turned into an immortal (I don't age). (Looking ~25-30) Naturally, this brings around some problems. After ~10 years of fun, people started making comments on how young I look. I fear that in the next 10 years this will seriously affect me. People will start asking real questions. I'm planning to disappear. But life today is too connected. I need passports everywhere, money, jobs where people don't ask who I am and going to jail for a longer time could be very problematic. Any fixes? What do I do? (Starting point: Central Europe/US/similar, Caucasian male, ~50k€ funds available). 

Imagine a world of magic. This magic can do anything you want it to, as long as physics agrees (totally useless addendum: physics is actually a very pendantic guy, but rumour has it his mistresses have been seen flying). Meaning, energy is to be conserved. A spell can lay dormant for centuries, but once activated it can only consume the amount of energy put into it when casted. Which is why magicians are very good cooks, they have to get fat fast before casting a powerful spell and then consume their fat all at once to put the energy into the spell (others just kill animals, but that's frowned upon). Now skeletons are easy to use as tomb guards (scary, bones are easy to get), but how much energy would be needed (approx.) to have a skeleton actually be able to fight? They don't have muscles etc. so keeping all those bones aligned would be consuming some energy already. Is it feasible to cast the skeleton spell and the remains of an army within a few days/weeks/months without having big energy sources available (aka food, maybe a companion), or would those skeletons rather need more energy? "Careful, there are skeletons there, they'll chop you into parts!" "I know, just watch." The hero charges into the dungeon activating all trap spells, turns around, sprints out of the dungeon, releases the stick holding the boulder next to the door, waits two days, removes the boulder and walks into the dungeon because the skeletons had only enough energy to hit the boulder once or twice and are now just bones lying on the ground. I'd like to evade that scenario. 

Its mass is almost 3.5 times greater than Earth, and its diameter 1.4 times wider. Now let's imagine that Kepler-10b takes the place of the fourth planet, that of Mars. 

North Africa has its own series of Great Lakes. (Though this map does not take rivers into account, and Lake Chad, in this scenario, is not of an accurate shape or area size.) 

Long ago, I asked for a kind of steel alloy under an alternative recipe. Right now, the list is as follows: 

As you can see, the human half and the horse half are never in pigmentary sync. In nature, you have to be one color scheme or the other. So here's my proposal--the centaur's human half will be of either Caucasian, Asian or Polynesian design, but both halves will be the same color, be it: 

The mountains of the American West have some major differences. For starters, only the Rockies stand firm—no Coast Range, no Grand Canyon and most certainly no Sierra Nevada. The Rockies on Great Lakes Earth have a different road from ours. If we use it on our map, we’d see the Rockies starting in the Canadian village of Chesterfield and meandering to the next point, Rapid City, South Dakota. Once there, it makes another meander through the eastern borders of Wyoming, Colorado and New Mexico before making one last meander across the Texas-Mexico border. While our Rockies stand no taller than 14,440 feet above sea level, the tallest peak in a Great Lakes Rockies is measured to be 14,505 feet. From there, only two simple questions stand: 

As far as I can tell, this is minimum ratio of oxygen to CO2 in which humans and (all?) animals can safely live. What would be the meteorological, biological or physical implications of living in this sort of atmosphere? 

So from what understand they want the most militarized weapons, but also the easiest to hide --which is contradictory. I think what you are looking for is some sort of collapsible semi automatic long gun, It would probably have a stock which is folding, extendable or detachable, the barrel would have to screwed on (or assembled in some other means) perhaps be in two or three parts when carried, and the clip would kept in a separate place on the body (probably the boot and one clip in each). Maybe even a detachable grip. Thus the largest part of the gun is the the trigger apparatus So the gun would take some time to assemble, at least 30 seconds. That's not so much a problem though (could even provide some great story suspense that actually meakes sense). If you make it a 22 caliber rifle say (which would be all you need), you could get the individual parts down to size of about an adults man's hand and have say a trigger and chamber, folding flat stock, grip (that maybe expands from the width of finger to two or three inches long (still the height of a finger, a barrel that probably collapses into two three pieces like a blind man's cane, and the magazine(s). Hide the trigger/chamber in the small of the back, magazines in one boot, barrel in the other, grip probably in the sleeve and the leaves the very thin collapsible folding stock probably under an armored Kevlar breastplate 

The problem is not so much the strong magnetic field (either a huge permanent magnet or a super conducting magnet), because a high temperature super conducting magnet might be feasible in the (near?) future. It's not the hf coils for reading the returning signals. It's homogeneity! An mri device works by reading the energy at a specific frequency level which reaches the hf reading coils. The frequency describes the location of origin because gradient coils are used to superimpose a slight offset onto the basic field which varies by location. So that each point in the target volume has a different magnetic field strength. That way the lamor (or lamour?) Frequency changes and the signal received by the reading coils has a different frequency for each location of origin. That's the frequency-space coding that allows you to reconstruct an image. The less precise the magnetic field, the lesser the image quality. There are open bore mris and small mri for small probes, but shooting a magnetic field around and getting any kind of signal that is more than nonsense is not feasible in near future. So let's go further in time. If you can measure very low energy and effectively calculate all the noise you would get, the presence of a human in the magnetic field of the earth could be picked up as slightly different noise by a reading coil. Combine that with a high temperature super conducting magnet which generates a magnetic field at a target (handwave, or maybe someday by adding cancellation) or a visual measurement of the distance and the expected magnetic field there and a lot of calculation power and you could actually get a signal from another human. As to blur, the quality of the image depends on measuring time and homogeneity. If however you could calculate exactly how the field would look like at your target and what deviations you'd get and compensate motion with the camera data etc. You could get some good data. However the calculation necessary is way out of our reach today and if you had an ai capable of that, there would probably be easier ways to calculate the needed dosage. For example, a simple rgb camera can already measure the heart rate of someone by filming their skin (the green channel is best for just reading out the waves from the bloodflow). Combine that with an infrared camera, some statistical data and a weight and fitness estimate and you can already get a lot of information about the physical condition. TL;DR: no, a lot would have to happen first, essentially leaving you in a future with very high tech and a lot of different possibilities we can only imagine today. 

If you want to look at why this happens in the real world, it's resource extraction. You see this in the European era of colonial (a lot), but even in modern times with powerful countries such as the United States backing regimes they don't necessarily like (such as Saudi Arabian Royal Family), against their rivals in the region because Saudi Arabia ensures them access to oil. Similar dynamics played out in Colonial India, in the "New World" with native tribes, in Africa (are playing out even today in Africa). Why does this happen? I mean, if the Aliens are more powerful, why not just wipe out humans to get to their resources? Well the United States Armed Forces definitely have the capability to wipe out every country in the Middle East and "take the oil." There are several reasons we don't. The biggest is probably that public opinion just wouldn't support it. Nobody in an educated and open society (or at least very few people) want genocide and or national piracy openly committed in their name. LONG SIDE NOTE: You could argue that in war time it would be accepted, or even in the wake of a 9/11 scale terrorist attack, but the world is too globalized now, too instant, too visible. What kind of support would the "moral bombings" of WWII had had if there videos in full color of charred bodies streaming live on youtube at the time. But anyway, unless humans attack your aliens, this whole side note is a mute point. The next more cynical reason is that dead men make terrible laborers. It's just a more efficient use of resources coerce or pay people to work than kill them, and if they are trying to kill each other... well backing one side is an excellent way to get them to work for you under threat of annihilation without actually having to even threaten to annihilate anyone yourself. The believability of this really depends on the aliens themselves. If they are James Cameron Alien type monsters or Invasion of the Body Snatchers single mind ends just means no regrets type aliens, it falls apart. However, if Alien society resembles our own with shifting political dynamics, value of individual life and limited resources: totally believable. Becky Chamber's novel "The Long Way to a Small Angry Planet" (which I'd recommend as fun read) actually revolves around this very dynamic. A powerful Galactic inter-species Federation(? forget exact term she uses for governing body) admits a faction of a new race into the federation (which gives this faction a defensive treaty) even though they are at war with other factions of their own species to gain access to resources within this species' territory. As far as which side the Aliens choose to back: it's either going to be which side the higher ups perceive as being in a better position to begin with (nobody wants to back a loser); which is more willing to work with the aliens, or aliens think would be more dependable to work with; which is percieved as the good side in the realm of alien public opinion... probably some combination of the three.
