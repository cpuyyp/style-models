Never ever go on "auto-pilot", might it because diffuseness seems to be most unproblematic. That's "animal practice" and absence of mindfulness and investigation, does not lead to discerment and bear a lot of dangers. When doing, experiencing, what ever phenomena arises: know, investigate, judge it. As for actions (body, word, thoughts):

Pali Chanting by the monks of Metta Forest Monastery can be found as audio here. A text version incl.translation, corresponding, is also generously given. Aside of chanting style, there are differents in regard of the set between Nikayas but even from monastery to monastery, also Nikayas from one country to another. In regard of the text within the single parts, there are also, but just small differences traceable. Generally the Dhammayut style most plain an undecorated is understood easy and from all others able to follow.

Dhamma is very individual issue, or better conditions are personally made. It leads to nothing to try to make conditions for all or many the same. Kamma of each being is different and each particular situation is also different. If not having certain conditions, it's of use to work on them. If demanding there are debts. Letting go rightously and step by step of trade in this sphere, by letting go ones desires and objectiveshow it should be one gains freedom, freedom of duyties after liberating desire. As for leaving home and walk the way of the Buddhas noble disciples, it's required to have no debts and being free of service duties for others (Government, King...). If such is not given, can not be obtained, it's very difficult, most not possible to ordain. It would be not allowed for a Bhikkhu to give ordination for one "who is in the kings service." Rājabhaṭavatthu - The Case of One Who is in the King’s Service Duty of servis is not only in regard of millitary service but also in regard of all other duties as not free housholder and citizen (one with duties). It would be a more peaceful world if people know and respect their duties in certain circumstances they are then if knowing rights and after demanding and increasing imbalance and wrong views all over the world. Only one having left behind the "benefits of bondage", home, citizenship, if being "stateless", not holding any rights in exchange with the world and it's sociaties, has no other dutiy then to strive for the end of all duties. 

A maybe good and helpful talk on this matter, also in regard of the other current question by same questioner, by you: 

By touch (of avijja - not knowing as things realy are), phenomenas experiances comes into play. As for the subsequences: Thing exist is one extrem, things do not exist another, aviding extrems, the Tatagathas teaches the middle path.

Avoid fools and association with them, those no shame in doing evil and spread unskillfulness like poision! 

It's worthy to count that a materialistic view falls into the range of fatal wrong views or evil views and such is destinated to bad states and root of the 5 Abhithananis, as itjs sixth. In regard of relation to right view, something "materialist" usually also deny and excuse it with being on the level of renounciation-equanimity, some words might help in addition: 

Working on the base, giving right causes for effects, is most importand. There is of course much faith nedded to stick more with just focus on causes and trust that results will come. Dana - Sila - Bhavana, step by step. And doing all the steps till it's limits (e.g. perfect in ones circumstances/livelyhood) to be able to take the next step. Look for a good stand where you are, right now. This Dhamma is not for "wellness" and trade, but for the escape from suffering and the welfare of many. It's not thought for compensation but for release. May all of you become rightouse full time Yogies (one who takes on the task, worker; e.g. practicing the whole path) soon, maybe even renounce the world today, may you day by day, with all your deeps, develop the causes for this auspicious conditions. (On the generouse request and suggestion of Nyom Lanka, some additions and links, for better understandig are added. There comes also a nice story, provided by the wanderer Isiul-Dhamma, a simile, into mind, describing the path of liberation: under kamma and the pāramīs, the prisoner story.)

It's a terrible missconception and total path destroying to spread that devotion does not or only less works as a fundamental tool. There are two wonderful essays/talks, which, if finding the right devotional attitude in regard of the blessing meeting teacher, might change ones non-dhammic believes and bring one on track: Devotion in Buddhism, by late Ven. Nyanaponika Thera Respect, Confidence and Patient and Opening the Door to the Dhamma - Respect in Buddhist Thought & Practice, by Ven Thanissaro Thera General infos and explaings in regard of respect and devotion might be found here: Respect and Veneration Showing disrespect toward the Three Gems is a serious break of the Base, cutting one off. If such might happen to one, one should quickly confess it and renew one refuge. Out of that case Dhammic-Refugees with solide confidence cite daily in the evening: 

Why seaching after better evil? Why not striving for abstain of evil and follow what one him/herself wouldn't harm? How can there be killing, harming life, without greed, desire, thirst (tanha), caving after sensual pleasure, becoming, not-becoming/being? Killing and taking of what is not given, abuse and lying, speaking untrue and for a favour, always involves desire for one or another food (joy from physical nurishment, touch/contact, intellectual intention, consciousness). Just look attentive. That's corruption (duṭṭha), nothing else. Don't feed corruption in ways of thinking, in ways of association, nurishment and entertainment. Why seek for better foolishness and don't go after the wise? What does one expect on such looping tracks of views and stands. Dhamma is simple: abstaining from harming life is skillful and beyound that, in this regard, there is no good. Entertaining ones intellect? Such causes a lot of pain, for one self and many. There is no such as aversion and in it's extrem killing when there is no such as big greed and love (tanha for sensuality, becoming, not becoming/being) on first place. And there is no such as greed if there is not strong delusion at first place, wrong view, not-knowing. Hatred, aversion, is "just" the other side of love, the twin brother, honey (his poision) for the fool:

No other gifts as that of being engaged in virtue, concentration and discernment, and it's share, giving of what one might own, in regard to their stand, would actually help. If one, even if "blessed", is capable to accept a gift... beings are owner of their actions, and even such Dhamma giving can, if strong defiled, run out into harm, not to speak that it could be made in corrupt manner easily, as we know todays busines with Dhamma. Feel free to take (upon the task to investigate honest) or throw gifts away. Your actions are just your destiny. To understand the topic in all it's deep ressons this explaining is most useful, especially for "western" or better very wordily and short timely orientated mind: Wisdom over Justice. [Note: This is a gift of Dhamma and not meant for commercial purpose or other low wordily gains by means of trade and exchange.] 

Confess it in a group or to an individual who have not fallen into same transgression. If possible pay compensation and/or accepted pardon if possible. Otherwise, if no further damage can be expected, forfeit the unrightous gained. Resolve to abstain from it in future (good if making it in formal way by taking, asking the precepts anew). Try to find assossiation with people where taking what is given is taken serious to possible grow and not to tend upwards naturally. 

In regard of contemplatives, Nyom DeusIIXII and those open to it: No hindrances are starved by just/only Jhana, either one or endless sessions. Listening/reminding/knowing the Dhamma and appropriate attention are necessary, where ever one might dwell. Now (the guessed paradox is that) hindrances need to be abounded ("temporary") to reach Jhana and for that case they might be (prompted/unprompted) suppressed. "Listen & pay close attention. My person will copy & paste on to you:" 

Once path is gained, the training in virtue becomes a training in heightened virtue, no more relaying on wordly understandings of what is taking without being given for example. Stealing is no more justified by conventions in regard of tolerated transgressions by other laws aside of simply that. For one no shame in deliberal lying and all it's various appearances, hiding his misconducts and so on, such is not only not even near the path but said that there is no evil such a person is not able to do. One of right view, beyound world, therfore is not able to transgress the basic precepts deliberatly for any purpose in or for the world, not even for the sake of Nibbana, since he knows and has no more doubt of what is path and not-path. At the very end of all sufferings discernment and views of all kind are (to be) released. [Note: This is a gift of Dhamma, not meant for commercial purpose or other low wordily gains my means of trade and exchange] 

So at least it's all a matter of how strong delution is, how obviously basic right view. On it wrong resolve/intent/will is based, which is base of actions by body, signs, thoughts.

There might be many school with many different ideas, some following the Buddha and serving the Dhamma and Vinaya, some using it as base for own ideas. Once the Buddha was asked by his former foster mother, Ven Gotami, in regard of how to recognize whether teachings are Dhamma-Vinaya (the name the Buddha gave his founded religion) or not. He answered: 

[Note: This is a gift of Dhamma and not meant for commercial purpose or other low wordily gains by means of trade and exchange.] 

There might be to less attention on "either pleasant-nor-unpleasant" feelings. Maybe good to focus more on the many graps of being not attentive enought in this way to be able to obsere it more clearly. Also the "acting-mind" seems to have never been recognised. Phenomenas do also not last, last even 10 secounds. To get beyound Illusion-of-continuity it needs to be seen who, or better what drives of giving cause for continue birth, birth, birth... What can be done to gain needed concentration? Improve serious non-stinginess by sufficent acts of generosity and precepts keeping seriously and by heart. This merits give the needed causes. [Note: This is a gift of Dhamma and not meant for commercial purpose or other low wordily gains by means of trade and exchange.] 

Be carefull, all is propably still open. [Note: This is a gift of Dhamma and not meant for commercial purpose or other low wordily gains by means of trade and exchange.] 

Feel touched: By being very deluded, ungrateful, overestimating oneself, e.g. wrong view, one is able, everyone not secure yet, to harm ones nurishing and most supportive "gods"... guess if you would be able. Hmmm... "every event is because of karma" => because of ones deeds, because of others... by accident, by othwardly power... all of the many secterian ideas is not what the Buddha taught. 

Maybe it would be good to change the title into "How to deal with spirits while on Vipassana-Retreat?". Generally see them as a gift, those "teachers" appearing as spirits, for they are presenting the task that you need to fullfill to step forward. Such disturbance is something very common and often reported by elders. It's recognised mostly as "prove" of the meditator if he is serious in goodwill, viture and objectives. No access to vipassana for one not honest in his aspirations, for one with wrong views and lack of metta (right resolve), a person not feeling obligated to those more sublime. The advices of the teachers, to practice metta and to win over yourself are proper and right. Reading here a discouragement to go their again: That is opposite a warrior nature and the ways even the Buddha encouraged his Monks, who where running away from spirits, to return on that place, giving them the famouse Karaṇīya Metta-Sutta as their tool. 

Typical approaches of "materialism" are denying life before and after that of which one remembers, regards as his, rejecting cause and effect by giving virtue not much value and no regards torward parents, leader, elders, contenplatives... thinking to be independent and do not owe anybody anything aside of maybe material exchanges, which might be even at the level of fine material things like knowledge and the sphere of arupa- existence: spiritual-materialism. kāmapuggalo, therefore, would be not enough to discribe a "materialist, since especially extreme appearances of these view are really a matter of giving ones ideas about existence and non-existance very much value. Even such as to develop "Buddhism", what else than materialism stands behind? And yes, materialist are much after "it should be lived like that", this is that is not and they are, even denying, very after communist approaches, giving human or bigger groups, what ever they are, certain special value and identity. Buddhadassa was surely one of the modern fathers of "materialism-buddhism" and inspiration for many who have difficulties to get the Dhamma aside of common ideas, but not the only one. It was that way before, while the Buddha and this lineages will certainly remain continuously in Samsara. It's not good if leaving ones territory and start to work for the world while feeding on that given for beyonds sake. 

Good detail teachings on Metta, also in relation to Vipassana, one may find in Ven. Nyanadassanas Words on Karaṇīya Metta-Sutta A probably good way and of course most traditional, would be if putting effort into learning to maybe recitate the Karaniya Metta Sutta You may make use and follow the Venerables of Wat Metta: Audio download (pali/engl) and the text to it. Then chanting it, while starting to follow above steps. Having later found good understanding of metta, one might arrange ones "own" gift with short or extended stanzas. Metta & Mudita [Note: This is a gift of Dhamma and not meant for commercial purpose or other low wordily gains by means of trade and exchange.] 

You would not like it, you don't like it, in all that instances where the Buddha rebukes and uses harsh words, give you certain names... and remind you on you duties saying "Bhikkhus!", do you?... so "it's a shame..." counts just for the sweets in the question, or? On an ideal level it can incl. also novices, wanderers, lay people... Most significant to find a indication is surely the Dhammapada, when of course it is not everywhere clear that the Buddha spoke in such a broad manner. See Brahmanavagga and Bhikkhuvagga. (One needs to remember that many of those quotes are actually speaking of Arahats, which by nature could not live more than some days as lay person if not able to leave home.) The general implemented feeling for modern and western lay Buddhist that they are directly and conscious incl. is merely founded on a marketing strategy, similar with "you can" advertising to lift the self-esteem and sell in this way a product. In traditional countries really as good as no lay Dhammika would ever be dare to estimate him/herself being directly adressed. People living since long time next Bhikkhus with Vinaya know and get aware that there is even outwardly a big difference. The phenomena that householder getting, aside of those being actually strong involved in monastic live, into the teachings of monks/Bhikkhus is a very young one, and again, has much to do with improper livelihood and trading in Dhamma: a wrong livelihood phenomena of monks. But here we are, and one can be sure that it was not the most smartest way, going along with the Vipassana-for-everyone-movement from Burma and the imperial visions from Sri Lanka, perhaps leaded by Anagarika Dhammapala and German Dhamma-trading monks, introducing selling of Dhamma in the world since actually no foundation of the original ecomomy of generosity could be found ever for some hand full monks. It's actually a 98% laymans enterprise what western and modern "Buddhists" experiances as "Buddhism". When speaking about laymans/householder enterprise it incl. all the many monastics who actually live and trade in improper dependency. If that situation becomes more clear, if one understands that there is actually no functioning Sangha of Bhikkhus in the West till today, it becomes clear why the market requires to pychological lift householder generally on the same level. How ever, as the Buddha told, real homelessness is a matter of being ot attached to the senses. In this regard, if one trains after having mastered virtue already, to abound sensuality (e.g. eight Silas serious, or ten), that would be the time one could really take on the teachings torward the Bhikkhus in meaning and detail. There is no problem to listen and read about the teachings directed to the Bhikkhus, they are no secret at all, but for ones own welfare it's good to know and understand whether one is directly spoken to or an Upasaka/Upasika (one who comes near), or even have not really taken refuge in the gems yet. Today there are many of the third kind, with not even respect for the juwels, estimate themselves as Bhkkhus/Bhikkhunis. Formal a Bhikkhu is a person who is by the status bond to Vinaya and the rules, a person who formal seeks nothing in the world but fears it. That is aside of (Noble) beggar (one who does not ask for anything and keeps high virtue) the second deeper meaning of Bhikkhu: one who fear the world. Another thing worthy to note is, that the word Bhikkhu was used even by the Buddha before the founding of the Sangha. The Buddha adressed his his former ascetic fellows before awakening, later also as Bhikkhus while still having not taken refuge in him. So when reading the Buddha adressing "Bhikkhus" than it's good to see it in a dhammic way: exclusively from free given alms living people who live a live to end suffering, keep virtue (not harming, not taking) and restrain from any sensual pleasure: eg. people with right resolve (followed by actions in accord). So if on that level, where ever you might be, be sure that the Buddha includes you directly when speaking to "Bhikkhus". If today or at the moment not in this range, better then to missuse it for certain overestimation of oneself, to take it as a powerful drive to reflect on the Sangha and for mudita, ideals which are worthy to work on gaining them, preparing ones own way in a proper manner step by step, building the foundation that can no more be removed if right done. Such is in all cases wiser as to risk a suggested run throw muddy waters. And at least, one who stands aside, is not easy personally touched. If one likes to take an adressing "Bhikkhu" even now and here personal: good, but take than also the hard rebukes and calling you a fool very personal. So it's like everything in the world, to have pleasure one needs to take the pain as well, even for the way out of this dilemma. May all of you become Bhikkhus (in an ideal sense) soon and by that means transcendent the world and suffering, oldage, sickness and death. May all of you wisely honor and respect the fastly disappearing Sangha of the Bhikkhus, nurish and maintain it, knowing that there will be possible the time and existence where oneself would wish to still have such an even and layout path and community. Nothing appears without previous and present given causes. [Note: This is a gift of Dhamma and not meant for commercial purpose or other low wordily gains by means of trade and exchange.]
