I was arguing with a climate change denier. He said that appealing to a scientific consensus, even one as overwhelming as 97%, is fundamentally an appeal to authority fallacy and hence invalid. He said that it was no different than appealing to a religious body on the state of the universe or the existence of a god. In response, I pointed out to him that an appeal to authority was only fallacious if it referred to an "authority" who wasn't actually a qualified expert on the topic being discussed. Hence, deferring to the consensus of qualified climate scientists was logically valid in a discussion about climate change. To this, he said that the term qualification is itself ambiguous. To believe a person is qualified would be to believe that the body giving out the qualifications (e.g. an university) was actually doing its job correctly. This belief itself would be predicated on a form of faith, which, in his view, is irrational. According to him, this faith would literally be the same as putting faith in the Church that the Pope is a messenger of God. He also said that the selection bias that would exist in the climate science community would invalidate any arguments they might make. When I pointed out to him that scientists actually used evidence to support their arguments, he said that since this evidence was out of the scope of his understanding, it was equally as valid as the spiritual experiences of a religious person claiming that his experiences were "evidence" of the existence of God. Thus, according to him, the conclusions of a religious fanatic would exactly be the same as the conclusions of scientists, from a rational person's point of view. Now, intuitively, I know that his whole argument was incredibly idiotic. But I seem to have no way to actually refute his argument in the scenario of rational discussion, without introducing the concept of trust/faith in the scientific community and the qualifying bodies. It is incredibly unlikely that I will encounter such an out-of-left-field argument from anyone else. But if I do, what arguments should I arm myself with? 

I think there is a point or two to pull out of the original question and supporting expansion of the question. First, you state, 'suppose there are people who like...' If we take part 1 of Kant and apply a universal rule evaluation, we could say it is good to give people what they like. So satisfying part 1 eliminates the negative of part 2. In other words you are not treating those people like 'means', your treating them like ends. Second, 'treating someone' like a mean versus and end is a rather complicated by the more imprtant fact of allowing the other party to participate in the decision. Sadly, I am not more well schooled in Kant, but I do enjoy pondering his universal rule. 

Interestingly I don't think Kant & Darwin are incompatible. In fact, I am begining to think they are actually two components of a much larger model on the development of 'success.' Darwin's idea that attributes are random is not really relevant to Kant's point. I would submit there is a slight missreasing. Darwin posits that features are random in their development or that nature does not develop features purposefully. But in a sense nature does. Features develop in a particular environment and support the continuation of both a feature and creature. Evolution selects the features which lead to reproductive success. Evoltion is the process of nature. Therefore nature is not random it is experimental. And like in the concept of brainstorming it doesn't matter where 'ideas' about a problem come from, each is put on the table and reviewed. In a sense Darwin was stating features, like ideas, appear and there source is not important in the evaluation process. The feature's reproductive success is critical. And this leads to Kant. All 'organs' fill a specific purpose. Meaning the existence of the 'organ' implies, by its existence, that it has supported reproductive success and therefore is fullfilling some purpose. Of course this ideas maybe filled with extaneous blather that will be filtered out as it's reproductive success is refined. 

Two clear distinctions come to mind: 1) Biologically, hair or a beard is already 'dead': there are no nerves or blood vessels in hair. Any sensation from hairs is because tension or pressure on them reaches nerves in the skin. Not so a limb, which is living tissue. 2) Hair or a beard is continually growing and falling off, so its destiny is to be either cut, or fall off naturally. Not so a limb, which is permanently attached to the body. I see no connection to the sorites paradox, which deals with the question how an indiscernible quantitative change eventually results in a quite dramatic qualitative change. In Simeon Visser's question quantity is irrelevant: It can be posed even when comparing a large amount of hair to a very small limb. 

Your assumption (1) is a certainty - it is so, by definition. Therefore 2: 'I'm not certain that I cannot be certain of anything', is invalid. 

The first philosophers had no sources and no vocabulary other than what their own powers of reason could muster. But the attitude many on this site seem to take regarding "philosophy" reminds me of the attitude of classical musicians: Anything that does not fall within their accepted tradition and uses their accepted terminology is not worthy of serious consideration, ignoring the fact that much of what is today considered "classical music" was once "popular music". (Beethoven as a pianist might be categorized as a jazz musician today, based on his inventive and improvisational approach.) It seems that such an attitude endangers the pursuit of "philosophy" and risks bring about its eventual extinction - much as classical music today is limited to a very small audience relative to the population as a whole. This is a loss both to the public at large and to the 'classical community'. To quote the well known jazz musician, composer and critic Leonard Feather: 

In his "The French Revolution, a History", 3.3.II, Thomas Carlyle writes the following: "for all battle is well said to be misunderstanding" He is speaking in reference to the terrible conflict between the Girondins and the Jacobins, after the execution of Louis the XVI in 1793. Both sides envisioned a grand Republic of France, but according to Carlyle, they fought to the death because they misunderstood each other's visions of how that republic should be implemented. I am troubled by this passage: I understand that many 'battles' are indeed the result of misunderstanding - often our words or actions do not accurately reflect our thoughts and emotions, or are misconstrued by others. The result is often conflict. Perhaps that was indeed the case with the Girondins and the Jacobins. My gut reaction to Carlyle's assertion is that he's unquestionably wrong: There are many battles, perhaps the greatest battles that have been fought, that are not due to misunderstanding, but arise from deep seated conflicts of interest or world views that are in direct opposition: "Good vs Evil"; "Haves vs Have Nots"; "Conservative vs Progressive", etc. I found that Kant in "Metaphysical Elements of Justice", states: "in the right of nations to go to war and to carry on hostilities is the legitimate way by which they prosecute their rights by their own power when they regard themselves as injured; and this is done because in that state the method of a juridical process, although the only one proper to settle such disputes, cannot be adopted" This point of view seems clearly at odds with that expressed by Carlyle: Can we say that "the legitimate way by which they prosecute their rights by their own power when they regard themselves as injured" can be interpreted as simply a misunderstanding? A state regards itself as injured because it misunderstood the intentions of its enemies? If State A cuts off the water supply of State B and State A goes to war with State B because of such, what misunderstanding is there? Nietzsche: Ecce Homo - "It is nothing but fanaticism and beautiful soulism to expect very much (or even, much only) from humanity when it has forgotten how to wage war." Can Nietzsche's assertion here (and in many other places) that the waging of war is a fundamental and essential component of the human spirit be resolved with Carlyle's contention? Carlyle's opinion seems quite clear: if people would simply take the time to sit down and talk to one another and clear up their 'misunderstandings', the conflicting points of view that lead to conflict could be resolved - 'understood' - and there would be no need for 'battle'. It seems that Carlyle longs for state of affairs that Nietzsche would deem "nothing but fanaticism and beautiful soulism". One quite graphic historical example that seems to fly in face of Carlyle's statement is WW II: Hitler's belief in Aryan supremacy spawned in him endless ambition and a sense of entitlement, and so he set out to conquer Europe and eventually the USA, in the belief that such was the destiny of the Aryan Nation. There was no misunderstanding about it: Hitler's idealogy (his madness....) spurred him to attempt to conquer the Western World (eventually the entire world...) and if other nations did not go to war against him, he would have proceeded to do exactly that. I could cite numerous other examples from History. Thought Experiment: Two adjacent states, one in the north, and the other south of the first. There is a river that runs north/south and supplies water to both states. Over time, the population of the northerly state increases such that they deem it necessary to dam the river to supply water to their growing population, thereby cutting off the water supply of the southerly state. As a result, the southerly state wages a war against its northern neighbor, to prevent it from damming the river. How would Carlyle explain such a conflict? Where is the misunderstanding that caused this conflict? The actions of the northerly state are in direct conflict with the interests of its neighbor to the south, simply due to its own need to supply its grown population with water. There was no misunderstanding that seeded this conflict. (And I believe that my thought experiment is far more than just that: Throughout History, wars have been waged due to exactly such circumstances) From what I know of Carlyle, his roots and outlook were decidedly Christian. Is his assertion a reflection of a Christian or Utopian point of view? The longing for a day when there will no longer be 'misunderstandings'? Do the lessons of History refute Carlyle's assertion? Who expresses a philosophical position in direct opposition to Carlyle's? What is the basis for their position? 

Time is a physical factor and the term used to capture this concept is the word 'TIME'. You attempt to give 3 different definitions that appear to need reconcilation. I would submit these are not equal definitions of the 'concept' time which has an experiential factor. Time, is a term that captures the concept of change, and can include a measure for reference. Time as a 'consciousness' is - sorry to say - mumbo jumbo. This is mixing concepts in an imprecise way to capture some separate 'emotional state'. History is not relevant to the concept of time. History is by-product of the 'passage' of time. Edit: To expand my use of 'mumbo jumbo' I will say that 'time' is a term with a more precise or concrete definition and usage. Humans mix metaphors like 'I felt time slow down...' but here the concept of time is trying to share a feeling. Time is the anchor to hang the feeling on. Like 'cold as ice.' Consciousness is the more subjective term which includes less concrete usage and clarity. Consciousness can be used to describe the act of awakening my mind and body, or my mind only like Descartes great leap of reason driven by consciousness. Only then consciousness is used loosely in medical terminology or when describing the interaction with an animal that 'feels' human like or touching. One might say the animal felt conscious. Then you have collective conscious, higher conscious, stream-of-conscious that all use conscious in a slightly different way. So 'mumbo-jumbo', used here, is what I would call the new age practice of using more precise terms to lend legitimacy to less precise terms and ideas. [ I read a lot of philosphy so this is not my idea... but I cannot site reference ] Time is relative - is saying that time exists and that it is experienced differently. Two of your definitions capture and refine the definition of time and answer the question in the affirmative that Time is both a concept and physical. 

The last comment by LordScree points to the heart of the original question and the appropriate philosophical answer. Geneic changes take place randomly and support the survival of individual ( families over time ), species in varying environments. This is the common association of evolution with genes. But Richard Dawkins broke this link with his idea of a meme. Certain ideas are more effective - reproducable - and therefore fitter and reproduce. Combining these concepts, like any good philosopher, and you can concieve of 'evolution' meaning change over time; survival of the fittest meaning 'things = genes, ideas, culture, spending habits, cleaning habits' leading to reproductive success. In other words, evolution has brought humans to the point of decoupling evolution from strictly genetic change and incorporated 'self created' environments into the 'random' changes that lead to reproductive success.
