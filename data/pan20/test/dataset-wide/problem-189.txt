A smart archaeologist (or rather: a team of different specialists) would thus not only be able to figure out that a nuclear war had taken place, but also roughly when it had. This will even be possible as long as there is geological strata generated during the war around to analyse. 

Large-scale nuclear disasters are unlikely. They would also release a lot of uranium-238, which would also be detectable. One could postulate a civilization which has reactors that only runs on highly enriched uranium, but that would be an extreme expense without any clear benefit. Large-scale deployment of dirty bombs is even less likely, for similar reasons: they would tend to leave a lot of fission products, but there is no reason for there to be a lot of uranium-235 and no uranium-238. 

We can ignore the last category for our purposes here: the other two will provide clearer evidence. Unspent fissile material The unspent fissile material will be either uranium-235 or plutonium-239. Uranium-235 has a half-life of over 700 million years. Thus, virtually all of it will still be around after the two million years in the question. This will be an excellent clue for the archaeologist: not only will it show that someone spread a lot of expensive, highly enriched uranium over the planet, it will also give them a good estimate of when, as you can analyse the amount of decay products from the decay chain to see how long since this took place. Plutonium-239 has a much shorter half-life, only 24000 years. This means that after two million years, it will be gone. However, it will not have disappeared entirely, but have also turned into uranium-235. This will mess with the time-span analysis of above somewhat, and introduce an uncertainty of about 100 000 years. Fission products Nuclear fission creates a range of different nuclides. In general, these are short-lived and unstable, but they will also generate daughter nuclides that are stable. The archaeologist will thus find a mixture of different isotopes, in proportions that does not occur naturally, in the same layers as the above uranium. This will clearly show that not only has someone spread a lot of uranium-235, but also a lot of fission products. The theory that would best explain this is an all-out nuclear war: 

Evolutionary game theory explains why different behavioural strategies can co-exist in a population. Initially developed by John Maynard-Smith & George Price, it was used to address the existence of non-lethal aggression: why should an animal display but not fight over desired resources? This is the 'hawk-dove' model, with two strategies: "hawk", which means fight until the opponent withdraws, and "dove", display, but run away if attacked. Bypassing all the analysis of this model, the outcome is that both hawks and doves can exist in a population if the cost of fighting is higher than than the value of the resource, and the particular values for cost and value determine the stable proportion of hawks and doves in the population. $URL$ Note that at the stable proportion, both strategies do equally well. (for a recent treatment of hawk/dove models: $URL$ Applying this to the question, we can consider "Mage" and "Magician" as two genetically-encoded (inherited) strategies (making the reasonable assumption that "bright and willing" intelligence/personality has a genetic component). By analogy with the hawk/dove model, Magicians can only exist if the costs of 'fighting' are greater than the value of the resource over which two individuals might 'fight'. The question suggests that status is the resource, and Mages can be extremely lethal if it comes to a contest (whether this is toe-to-toe fighting, attacking from the shadows, or something more subtle). Mages always win against Magicians, so Magicians should always beat a hasty retreat if they come across a Mage (or at least conceal the fact they are Magicians). So the evolutionary game theory answer to the question is that Magicians exist because this is an equally successful strategy to being a Mage. The only issue that needs to be determined is what proportion of Mage vs Magician is stable! Of course, things are slightly more complicated, because the population actually consists of three genetically-inherited strategies: Mage, Magician, and 'Normal' - 'Normal' loses out to both strategies - but the basic conclusions remain: at some proportion, being a Magician is just as successful (in terms of producing 'descendants', here, more Magicians) as being a Mage is at producing more Mages, and that is why there are Magicians despite the existence of Mages. 

Nuclear fallout will be around for an long, long time Nuclear fallout (note: "nuclear fallout" usually refers to radioactive fallout. I will be using a slightly different meaning due to the context of the question). will be detectable until earth is destroyed - if geology allows. I am no expert in formation of rock sediments or the spread of nuclear fallout, so I will assume that nuclear fallout will be preserved in relatively clear strata in e.g. sandstone. If so, any civilization with a relatively basic understanding of nuclear physics will be able to see that there was a big release of fissile material (uranium-235 and plutonium-239), along with products from fission processes. An atomic bomb works through a chain reaction in which a lot of either uranium-235 or plutonium-239 fusions (there are a few other choices of isotopes which might be technically possible to use, but they seldom are) . However, not all of the bomb material will be spent; a significant fraction will be released as fallout. This means that a bomb will spread isotopes from three different groups: 

Cigar-shaped. Space is a 3D environment, and attacks can come from any direction. This suggests that a sphere might be the best shape, with weapons mounted across its surface, but that would both be inefficient (most weapons could not come to bear upon a single target), and present a large target. A cigar-shaped object would allow weapons to target in all directions, particularly if turret-mounted, while vasty increasing the number that could bear on a single target and presenting a minimal cross section. Of course, this assumes direct line-of-sight style weapons. If space combat is based on missiles, and these are fired at extreme distances, the most effective shape will probably be the one that can hold the most missiles, so we're back to a sphere again (missiles could be fired from any 'side' of a sphere, and be guided to the target). Space combat might also be based on passive engagement - laying of 'mines' of some kind along desired (e.g. economical, efficient) routes. In this case, either technology - mine detectors/eliminators - will render the shape of the spacecraft moot, or, if we assume that these mines are difficult to detect/remove, then a cigar-shaped ship, propelled lengthways, would present a very limited cross section and so miss most mines (at least relative to other shapes). The 'nose' of such a ship might even be purely armour / disposable, to negate the impacts with mines that it doesn't miss. 

The requirements for developed theorium reactors are not that tough: easy access to thorium, limited access to uranium and other sources of power and no incentive to develop a nuclear arsenal (and this last point is perhaps not even true; there are some that claim that the uranium 233 that is the actual fuel in a thorium-based cycle is viable as bomb material). Thorium is today seen as a less viable choice because it would need different reactor technology than what is used in most of the world to be most effective. However, this is not in itself a major problem. The Soviet union, Canada and the UK uses or has used reactor designs that significantly differ from the US-designed LWRs. I will give you one possible scenario: Sweden had it's own program for building heavy water reactors, with uranium mined in Sweden (Sweden has a lot of uranium, but not very concentrated). Had the large thorium deposits found in Norway been on the other side of the border, it is possible it would have choosen designs based on thorium instead, and gotten so far before the non-proliferation treaty that it would have decided to not buy american LWR designs but instead continue with the domestic design. At the peak, Sweden's reactors produced slightly less than half of the electricity used, so that requirement is not much of a stretch. 

Simple answer, yes. Population numbers will adjust to the available resources through the mechanism of competition. Intense foraging pressure might lead to localised ecological changes - grass, for example, is much more resistant to consumption than arboreal leaves - and there may also be selective changes on the plants to resist high levels of consumption by high numbers of herbivores. So thornier, tougher, higher levels of tannins and other 'anti-feedants', which in turn will decrease available resources, and increase the intensity of the competition between the herbivores. 

It would be easier for such mating rituals and colouration to evolve, given the absence of predators, but whether or not it does depends on intensity of mate competition, and the balance between inter- & intra- sexual selection. 

although I agree that dogs are a pretty good fit for the description, and can be trained to respond to various complex commands (think sheep-dogs, who typically work without a leash and at some distance from the shepherd). In principle I see no reason for a dog not to be able to conduct a variety of tasks, and to travel with its master/mistress without a leash (avoiding modern traffic is one reason to keep otherwise well-trained dogs on leads). 

Unspent fissile material Decay products from fission processes Activated material from surroundings (e.g. bomb casing, air, soil) 

Is the reactor itself important to your story? Is it important that it was an accident with the operation of the reactor itself? If not, go for spent nuclear fuel instead. Spent nuclear fuel need to be stored before being moved to final deposition. This storage can be at the nuclear power plants, or at a central repository. In any matter, at one point, sooner or later, it has to be transported. While there can't be a nuclear explosion, there can still be terrorist attacks, or some other grand explosion that breaches the containment of the transport, destroys the canisters the fuel is handled in, and spreads the material. However, to really create a big exclusion zone, you will want to have some way to spread nuclear material as ash from a fire - this was part of the reason you got so much nuclear material from Chernobyl to spread over such a large area. The initial explosion made a hole, and spread large chunks of radioactive stuff over the surrounding area, and then radioactive ash was spread into the atmosphere from the burning graphite.
