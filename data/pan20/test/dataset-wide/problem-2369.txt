As explained in the footnotes/commentary - then a monk should make use of offerings properly and not do anything with them which will make the donors faith decline. 

As long as Ignorance (avijja) is present, there will be rebirth, with reference to the doctrine of Dependent Origination. The only way to "let things go" is by way of understanding. In Buddhism one overcomes Samsaric phenomena by understanding them through the practice of the Noble Eightfold Path, namely the insight portion of the Buddha's path to liberation. Only insight meditation can shed away the veil of delusion permanently. 

When doing vipassana meditation and when one is observing an object - for how long does one keep observing and noting the object? I have been wondering about this for a while now since i do not know what the "correct" approach is if such an approach exist. I have once read that one should keep observing the object until it ceases to exist in order to clearly see the dissolution-step of the process that all objects follow -> Arising, Presence, Dissolution. Thereby one will be able to see the impermanent nature of phenomena. Help would be much appreciated. Thank you. Lanka 

According to the Fifth Method of Dependent Origination, there are five causes and five results. The five results are the five khandas. The five causes are ignorance, craving, clinging, formations, kamma force. This is listed in the Vissudhimagga. Path Of Purification (2011 PDF, p601) These are broken up into two consciousness wholesome and unwholesome for humans who are lucky to have a wholesome factor in their near death moment of the immediate past life. Humans always have wholesome kamma force and sankhara (formations) The unwholesome is the craving consciousness. It includes the ignorance mental factor which is part of craving. Clinging is repeated craving. So all three are nearly the same type of unwholesome mind. Got that? Wholesome with unwholesome do not mix together, but the unwholesome mind can "surround" the wholesome mind. So when you did something good in a past life, like something of generosity, you wished to do something (that requires a body) or you wished to become someone (ignorantly). So someone who is male previously wished for becoming male. Someone who is female previously wished to be female. Whether or not one has enough kamma to get that wish is another story. It is like a raffle ticket. Buy more raffle tickets and you have better odds. Do something once that is really big and many raffle tickets get put into the pot. Habitual kamma is a good way to get that wish. Heavy kamma like what Bill Gates did, will also help. (His is both because of his continued involvement, but he may wish other things). Bill Gates probably did something similar in a past life and kept wishing to help other people (to do that with a male body). Then the opportunities (supporting kamma) from other kammas helped support that wish. Read "Outliers" and you will see it was not chance for him to become so rich. Often people switch sexes and species, but I imagine that most people wish with the same sex perception because they do not imagine otherwise. I suspect most sex changes happen via the animal realm. For instance, a dog may want the conditions to have food and whoever feeds him may be the gender resultant next life gender. There are of course humans who wish for sex changes and even do so even in their current life too! So it does happen as humans for future births as well. There is a wheel publication by Venerable Nyantiloka called "Fundamental Themes". It is not easy to read, but it is correct. "The Workings of Kamma" by Venerable Pa-Auk Sayadaw explains this too. There is a chapter on kamma in Ven. Narada's book.. "The Buddha and His Teachings". I think a pamphlet was made from that chapter too. This is a great book for newbies. You might be able to find a meditation manual on dependent origination by Ven. Pa-Auk Sayadaw. It is called "The Fifth Method". It is not readable for the average person. However the first section might be interesting. It is posted it to my website..unlisted. The rest should be easy to find for free. 

Stress can be broken up into mental and physical phenomena such as thoughts, emotions, muscle tension, pain etc. They are just impersonal phenomena arising and ceasing on their own accord. Anxiety is a variation of the 4th Hindrance of restlessness and worry (uddhacca-kukkucca). The hindrances are barriers that block one from progressing on the Path, unless one practices to understand and overcome them. In Vipassana meditation one treats all objects the same. No object is more or less important than the previous or next object. Just note the phenomena a couple of times and return attention to the abdomen (Burmese Method). 

If such a scenario occured their might be held a world wide Buddhist Counsil in order to establish some new rules for monastics, e.g. that they could now grow their own food in the right amount and with all precautions taken so that they would do the smallest amount of harm possible to living beings and to Nature. The other option is that nothing would be done. It would just be seen for what it is, i.e. an absence of food. The dying process is not much different than the living process. It's still a combination of seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, touching and thinking. 

I'm not sure if Buddhism can ever be fitted so neatly in such labels and boxes as you would like it to fit. Still, some traditions are sticklers to labeling, and I certainly was encouraged by my teacher spent many hours trying to memorize the names of the original eighteen schools, how they evolved into the main schools of Tibetan Vajrayana Buddhism, how each was split in several subschools, and so forth. The main reason to study all those classifications was to understand how Buddhist philosophy has evolved, and what major questions have been debated and discussed at each stage, and how each understanding of the Dharma can help certain kinds of beings more than others. Thus, a good teacher might be aware of a vast diversity of teachings from different vehicles, schools, sub-schools, and individual monasteries, and teach them according to the ability of the students to understand. Ultimately, to be honest, I would say that the only important 'classification' that a Buddhist practitioner should worry about is what their lineage is. 

I see the original question as been modified when I went online again. The original question included "hinting/asking" I have included this under wrong livelihood. Monks need to follow all of the rules 227 rules and also the rules in the Culavagga and Mahavagga. Likewise, they need to follow according to the commentaries as well in most cases. Most Western Bhikkhus do not like the commentaries. That is where "interpretations" can come. Most of the information below, is from the BMC The Buddhist Monastic Code Summary: A Bhikkhu cannot use money. A Bhikkhu cannot point out a kappiya without someone asking, "Who is you kappiya?" A Bhikkhu cannot accept envelopes presumably with money inside. It is an asannya offence (in the root text). Which means, no perception is necessary for it to be unallowable. That means the monks should not be intentionally ignorant. The BMC debates and allows the modern use of "checks." A Bhikkhu cannot ask for things from "Just anyone". He needs an invitation from a non-family member ( blood relation) A Bhikkhu cannot hint to "Just anyone" (as above) A Bhikkhu cannot do the above for another bhikkhu(s) either. The BMC says checks are not money but a "promise to pay." Sri Lanka and Myanmar Vinaya traditions call this money. Money is defined as anything accepted as used in trade. A US dollar is a mere bank note too. Google "A Life Free From Money pdf" The same as above is judged with signing checks. A bhikkhu can ask for a bowl from anyone if it is broken or stolen. A bhikkhu can ask for a single robe from anyone if he is left with only one (of three). A bhikkhu can go for alms in the evening for "extra items," usually medicine or oil for light. The donors will offer food and he will refuse. Then the person may ask, "what do you need?" Then he can say. Lay people or committees can ask "just anyone" for things or money, etc. for monks if it is their own idea. This might be what you are seeing on brochures and websites, etc. A Bhikkhu cannot ask his helper, committee etc, to ask others for money for himself. A bhikkhu must be invited by a committee or kappiya before he asks them for things. The above list is followed correctly unfortunately by a small minority of monks, known as vinaya monks, or forest monks. Often the other (majority) monks do not know what proper behavior is. They may memorize the rules, but do not think it is something to be practiced since corruption is so wide spread. One of my monastic friends told me he cried when he found out that he was never supposed to touch money. A monk may purify himself at any time. Often, they just do not know. Traditions often have interpretations which makes items seem "allowable.". Sometimes this is allowed and sometimes one can just be fooling oneself. In the end it is up to them. Often bhikkhus do not reflect or question questionable practices in a tradition because of the wide spread use. Money and medicines are often such topics. 

In my own tradition — Nyingma school of Tibetan Vajrayana Buddhism — vows/promises made to oneself are definitely binding, and, as @Sankha Kulathantille has explained, if those four conditions were present, that would certainly break the vow. And, of course, breaking the vow has a consequence. However, I think that there is quite a lot to be said about this particular instance of 'making vows to oneself'. As @Sankha Kulathantille has stated so clearly, only a Buddha can keep their vows 100% of the time. For us beginners in the path, we have purification practices, where we remember our vows (yes, even those made to ourselves), notice which ones have been broken, understand the circumstances why they were broken, apply an antidote (if we promised to do X but never did it, then we strive to do X), and make a new promise to ourselves to refrain from breaking the vow in the future. Of course, that doesn't give you the 'right' to break the vow over and over again, in the hope of purifying it — that doesn't work (it would be just hypocrisy — to ourselves!!). But as @zvolkov has pointed out, it's pointless to feel remorse all the time for having broken a promise to ourselves. Instead, we just have to recognize that we're not yet Buddhas and do our best to stick to our promises from now on. On the other side of the coin, it's also pointless to make a vow to oneself without having the intention, or the ability, to keep it. It's far better to reflect on that vow, very seriously, and work with yourself so that you come closer and closer to the point where taking that vow will not be seen as a 'burden', but something you do with pleasure. 

"Medicines" There are some things in the BMC which I think are very misleading, especially concerning, "medicines" and how "Any Reason" is defined (p232). I could not find any pāli evidence that mentions "hunger and fatigue" as a valid medical reason. I could be wrong, but I asked a couple of knowledgeable monks to verify this and they also agreed with my findings. This would exclude many things which are considered medicines. I will not cover further with lists of the "medicines." Only that there should be a valid reason for taking them and justifying their use after Noon. The reflection and criteria are below. It is in every monastery chanting book and should be chanted every day. (Nauyana chanting book source) "Medicine Reflection" 

I will be hopefully writing a readable version of the fifth method in my Abhidhamma Lessons located at $URL$ . It is planned for Lesson #9 and cumulative knowledge is assumed from lesson #1 onward. I am currently writing lesson #8 on mental factors. My guess is that it will be released sometime in November. I announce new lessons via gplus or Facebook. I will try to remember to update this entry when/if it gets finished. 

My main teachers have a lineage coming from both Nyingma and Kagyü, so their explanations might differ slightly from 'pure' Karma Kagyü teachings, but I was told that touching foreheads is a gesture of very endearing closeness. Good old friends might touch their foreheads as a recognition of their proximity. Similarly, teachers feeling a strong bond with some students will touch their foreheads with them when the students thank them for a teaching received. I was also told that it would be very impolite to 'demand' that a particular teacher touches their forehead with us, to somehow publicly recognize a closeness that doesn't truly exist. Specially gentle, kind, and compassionate teachers will often never discriminate among students — they will always insist to touch their foreheads after a teaching is giving. HH the Dalai Lama also often does that to complete strangers (with some eyebrow-raising from his entourage!). The point here is that a Bodhisattva truly never discriminates among sentient beings — he or she will feel close to everybody! 

If they support you then it is OK. You should ask for support according to their faith and ability. Normally supporters and family are the same words in pali. It is listed in the Metta sutta as family "kulesu", often translated as donors. However, one should live a modest life and ask for only what one needs. Asking for sangha needs is much better. It depends on your family's desire. There could be a problem with receiving donations from your parents if you gave them money beforehand. I am not sure of the exact details. While I do not know the exact rule for this, I do remember asking about this with a monk who gave his parents money and then asked for a computer specifically saying, "Use the money I gave you.". The teacher (Sayadaw U Kovida, paauk) said this would be unallowable. (This transaction never went through, by the way) To avoid a situation like this, if you do give your parents your money, you should say, "This is yours, use as you wish." Or "Do not use this for me or to monks." Then when you ask them for things, whatever they do, it is their money and donations are from their own doings. It is actually legal for them or even a bank to have money for you as long as you do not use it. This is how one ordains temporary in a vinaya tradition. If you decide to stay full time, things can get complicated with bank accounts (if you are one who cares about vinaya). Some need to temporarily disrobe to handle their affairs. According to ratapala sutta, he told his parents to throw the money in the river.
