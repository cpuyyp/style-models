May be I going to say something obvious, but I hope it will give some clarification since I feel (Maybe I'm wrong) that there is some confusion about where you are taking the homotopy cofiber regarding your comments about Lie groups. If you have a map of loop spaces (i.e. an $A_{\infty}$-map) say $f: \Omega X\rightarrow \Omega Y$ (where $X$ and $Y$ are connected pointed spaces) The homotopy cofiber in the $\infty$-category of $A_{\infty}$-spaces (group like) is computed as follows. First you take the bar construction and you obtain $Bf: X\rightarrow Y$, then you compute the homotopy cofiber in the category of pointed topological spaces which I will denote by $Y/X$. Finally, the homotopy cofiber (quotient) of $f: \Omega X\rightarrow \Omega Y$ in $\infty$-category of $A_{\infty}$-spaces is $\Omega (Y/X)$. The fiber sequence $\Omega SU(n)\rightarrow \Omega SU(n+1)\rightarrow \Omega S^{2n+1} $ can not be seen as a quotient group in any reasonable sense. A reasonable notion of quotient group of $\Omega SU(n)\rightarrow \Omega SU(n+1)$ in the category of $A_{\infty}$-spaces is $\Omega (SU(n+1)/SU(n))$ (where $SU(n+1)/SU(n)$ is the quotient in the category of pointed spaces so it is not the space of cosets.fee) 

I'm looking for an example of a finitely presented and finitely generated amenable group, that has a subgroup which is not finitely generated. The question is easy for finitely generated amenable group and an example is the lamp-lighter group $C_2\wr \mathbb{Z}$. An Abelian and finitely generated group has no such subgroups. There exists a bigger class of groups with this property? 

Let $\Gamma$ be a finitely generated residually finite group. For a subgroup of finite index $\Lambda<\Gamma$ let us denote by $\pi_\Lambda:\Gamma\rightarrow \Gamma/\Lambda$ the quotient map. Is it possible to find a subgroup $H<\Gamma$ such that the restriction of $\pi_\Lambda$ to $H$ is surjective for every finite index subgroup $\Lambda<\Gamma$? Does $SL_n(\mathbf Z)$ have such subgroups? Can we find such $H$ finitely generated? 

Let $G$ be a countable discrete residually finite group. Is there a way to characterise the actions of $G$ that are orbit-equivalent to profinite ones? Ozawa and Popa introduced the concept of weakly compact actions. Weakly compact actions are stable under orbit equivalence and profinite actions are weakly compact. Is it possible to find a weakly compact action that is not orbit equivalent to any profinite action? 

Adeel answer is perfect, I will be more basic. There is many notions of "2-category" structure here around. 1) the category of small dg-categories $\mathbf{dgCat}$ is symmetric monoidal closed category. Closed means that there is an internal $HOM$ in the sense that for any two small dg-categories $A$ and $B$ there is $HOM(A,B)\in \mathbf{dgCat} $ such that there is a natural isomorphism of sets $\mathbf{dgCat}(X,HOM(A,B))\cong \mathbf{dgCat}(X\otimes A,B)$. That means $\mathbf{dgCat}$ is enriched over it self. There is a functor from $H^{0}:\mathbf{dgCat}\rightarrow \mathbf{Cat}$ which gives you an enrichment of the category $\mathbf{dgCat}$ over $\mathbf{Cat}$, hence you can see $\mathbf{dgCat}$ as a 2-category. On an other hand, the internal $HOM(-,-)$ described before has the wrong homotopy type, you can not derive it since it does not take Dwyer-Kan equivalences (between fibrant-cofibrant objects) to Dwyer-Kan equivalences (the $\mathbf{dgCat}$ is not symmetric monoidal model category in the sense of Hovey). Bertand Toen constructed, for the model category $\mathbf{dgCat}$, the right notion of the derived internal hom denoted by $RHOM(A,B)\in \mathbf{dgCat}$ (using bimodules, I will not write the details). Moreover this new derived $RHOM(A,B)$ induces the derived Mapping space $Map _{\mathbf{dgCat}}(A,B)$ via the nerve functor of some well choosen subcategory of $RHOM(A,B)$). This new derived internal allows you to see the category $\mathbf{dgCat}$ as $(2,\infty)$-category and in the same time as symmetric monoidal $(1,\infty)$-category. An important consequence is the following isomorphism in $Ho(\mathbf{sSet})$: $$Map_{\mathbf{dgCat}}(A\otimes^{L}B,C)\cong Map_{\mathbf{dgCat}}(A,RHOM(B,C))$$ 

Let $G$ be a countable, Gromov-hyperbolic group. We say that $H$ is hyperbolically embedded in $G$ if $G$ is relatively hyperbolic to {$H$} (in the strong sense). This definition is due to Osin. A theorem of Bowditch says that infinite, finitely generated, almost-malnormal and quasi-convex subgroups of $G$ are hyperbolically embedded in $G$. Later Osin has proved that the conditions are necessary (even in the wider context of relatively hyperbolic groups). Quasi-convex subgroups are not necessary malnormal but they have always finite height by a result of Gitik, Mitra, Rips and Sageev. The height of $H\subset G$ is defined to be the maximal $n$ such that there exist $g_1,\ldots,g_n\in G$ with $g_1Hg_1^{-1}\cap\ldots\cap g_nHg_n^{-1}$ infinite (but all the $g_iHg_i^{-1}$ different). I would like to know how distorted a malnormal subgroup can be in $G$. Is there some class of groups for which malnormal implies quasi-convex? Examples? What about the relatively hyperbolic case? 

$\textbf{This is a point of view which means that it is only one side of the story}$. Let me start with Gel'fand theorem. The (opposite) category of compact Hausdorff spaces is equivalent to the category of commutative $\mathbb{C}-^{\star}$algebras. Roughly speaking the functor with associate to any space $X$ its algebra of continuous complex vaulted functions $C^{0}(X,\mathbb{C})$ realizes this equivalence. Gel'fand: $$compact-Hausdorff-spaces \cong_{op} commutative-\mathbb{C}-^{\star} Algebras. $$ $$ X\rightarrow C^{0}(X,\mathbb{C})$$ This equivalence has to potential generalizations. In one way we can ask to which spaces corresponds general commutative rings (commutative $\mathbb{Z}$-algebras). the answer was given by Grothendieck. $$ affine-schemes\cong_{op} Commutative-rings$$ $$ X\rightarrow \Gamma (X)$$ The other generalization is the noncommutative $\mathbb{C}-\star$algebras and non commutative spaces. In order to continue this story from homotopical point of view we fix a commutative ring $R$, and for any topological space $X$ we define the cochain complex $C^{\ast}(X,R)$, this is an $ E_{\infty}$-differential graded $R$-algebra. There is two interesting cases when $R= \mathbb{Q}$ and $R= \overline{\mathbb{F}}_{p}$. Sullivan theorem says that the homotopy category the localized category of simply connected spaces of finite ($\mathbf{Top}^{fin}$) type with respect to rational homology theory is equivalent to the category of simply connected differential graded $\mathbb{Q}$-algebras of finite type ($E_{\infty}-dgAlg_{\mathbb{Q}}^{fin}$) . Mandel's Theorem says the same in the $\overline{\mathbb{F}}_{p}$ case. Sullivan $\infty$-equivalence: $$L_{\mathbb{Q}}\mathbf{Top}^{fin}\simeq_{op} E_{\infty}-dgAlg_{\mathbb{Q}}^{fin}. $$ $$ X\rightarrow C^{\ast}(X,\mathbb{Q})$$ Mandel $\infty$-equivalence: $$L_{\mathbb{F}_{p}}\mathbf{Top}^{fin}\simeq_{op} E_{\infty}-dgAlg_{\overline{\mathbb{F}}_{p}}^{fin}. $$ $$ X\rightarrow C^{\ast}(X,\overline{\mathbb{F}}_{p})$$ PS: I did not state the nilpotent version and as I said at the beginning it is just a side of the story. 

the image of $y_i$ in G is $g_i$ for every $1\leq i\leq k$, the set $\{y_1,\ldots,y_k,R\}$ generates $F$ ? 

Let $F$ be a finitely generated free group. Consider $R\subset F$ a finite set of relations and denote with $G$ the quotient group of $F$ by the normal closure of $R$. Now suppose we are given another set of generator $g_1,\ldots,g_k$ of $G$. The question is the following: is it possible to find $y_1,\ldots,y_k\in F$ such that 

If it is not the case, is it possible if we suppose that $G$ is free? I'm able to answer the question only in one case: if $R=\{r\}$ and $G$ is free, then $r$ is an element of a base of $F$ so the answer is yes. I learned the proof of this fact in Lyndon-Schupp's book and it uses a kind of Freiheitssatz, so it doesn't help too much for the general case.
