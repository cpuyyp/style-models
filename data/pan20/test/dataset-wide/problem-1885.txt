In my field of work, for some reason, the hiring companies all put out their job offers at the same time (within a few days of each other), and do the hiring during the same period in the case of students fresh out of college applying for jobs. This might be because most companies offer to pay for Professional exams that we have to take in the first years of employement after we're done with University, so it might be some sort of agreement because of competition. I'm not familiar with the why. This phenomenon is happening across the country, but that specific time period differs depending on the location. In my case, I currently live with my parents in city A, where I have gone to university. City A has several companies that hire in my field, but not that many. I will be graduating in spring, and the offers in my city will be available in December. Since I was not 100% certain I'd be able to get a job on my first try, and I didn't want to live off my parents when I'm done with school, I also applied with several employers in city B, which is about 3 hours (car) from here, and a much bigger city. I am not a fan of big cities, so I would much rather work in city A, but I wouldn't mind moving to city B if the alternative is no work. The problem is that city B released all their offers recently. I applied, did a few interviews, and got one offer. I cannot reasonably wait until December to give them my answer. If I say no on the off-chance that I'll be hired in city A, then there was really no point in applying to city B. But if I say yes, can I still apply to the city A offers? Would it be professionally acceptable to do interviews with other employers after accepting an offer already, and would it be ethical, if I get hired in my prefered location, to change my mind and tell the other company I won't be working for them after accepting their offer, considering I haven't worked with them yet and they have months to find someone else anyway? I wouldn't have wasted their money on training, which will happen if I go work with them and find a job in city A two years from now. Furthermore, the current offer that I have to decide on are not hiring me for late-spring, as soon as I graduate, but for next September, because they said that they wouldn't have the resources to train me efficiently during the summer. Would getting a city A offer for May or June make a difference on the "is it acceptable" point? EDIT: The country is Canada, if that makes a difference. EDIT regarding the similar question. I am not asking whether I should keep looking, but whether I am allowed to without it looking bad. I want to apply to very specific jobs, and I had planned to before getting the offer. Furthermore, I wouldn't be looking "in case I get a better offer", but knowing fully well that any offer I would get would be better (because of the location), so I would want to take it. 

The quote above is unrelated but is indicative of someone who does not feel terribly confident in the area under discussion. This is likely more her own issue with herself than one with you. I think you are taking this too personally. She is doing nothing wrong and you are doing nothing wrong, you just have different communication styles. You will work with lots of people who communicate differently than you do through your career. Don't take it personally when they do. Don't make assumptions about other people's motives just from the words they use. Watch for actions instead. A snake will reveal himself or herself through actions not words. My second boss had to give me the advice to develop a thicker skin; this was probably the most useful advice I ever got. Not everything that you interpret as a put down is. And if it is, then telling her you are intimidated will lead to more put downs not less. So learn to cope. If you don't know what the words mean, look them up. If you do know, then she communicated perfectly well even if it was not your preference. If you are unsure what she meant, then ask for a clarification. No one can intimidate you if you don't allow it. 

If someone has just got his diploma, usually his resume will contain very few actual work experience in his field. Most student jobs are not in your field of work, so they are barely relevant to a resume. The only purpose of putting them there is to show you do work, not to show off any relevant skills (except interpersonal skills or generic skills like being reliable). So when you leave university to look for your full-time job, your education on your resume is significant. How significant is the time you needed to complete your studies? For example, if you studied in a program that usually takes 6 semesters (3 years), and you failed a few classes, you might have taken 4 years instead of 3. If you were working part-time during school, you might have done fewer classes per semester, and thus needed 4 or 5 years to complete it. On the other hand, if you took extra classes and summer classes, and ended up doing it in only 2 years, this is also a big difference. I always put the dates (just the years) of everything I did on my resume. If I add the dates I was in university, will it be a red flag to have done it faster or slower than expected? I could imagine en employer being cautious of someone who needed 2 extra years to get his diploma, but I could also imagine an employer seeing this as proof that this person doesn't give up or something. The same goes for shorter duration, I could see it going both ways. So how significant is the duration on your resume, and specifically is shorter always good or bad? What about longer? Should you leave out the dates completely in some cases to avoid hurting your case? 

The legality of this would vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Certainly in the US it is not uncommon for the company to do such a thing if you are no longer employed by them or about to be fired or if you go on a short or long term disability and they need to access your account for a legitimate business reason. It is never a good idea to use your work email account for any private purpose. 

It is of critical importance in the workplace to learn to get along with everyone even people you personally don't like or disapprove of. This is a job skill you clearly need to develop or people will stop wanting to work with you no matter how good your technical skills are. Technical skills are only about 10%-20% of what you need to be successful in the workplace. Persistence and doing what needs to be done even when it isn't fun are about 40-50% of what you need and people skills are the rest. People skills includes basic politeness to every single person in the the workplace including the janitor, the admin assistant, bosses, older or younger people, people of other genders, races, religions or sexual orientations, people who you think are not as good as you, etc. People skills also include having an attitude that is helpful not harmful, taking actions that make people want to help you and work with you such as helping others (not just being critical of them), being friendly, learning to sell your ideas, playing office politics, etc. To fail to congratulate her is petty, it generates bad feelings and it makes you look like a jerk. It makes it harder to work with the person in the future. The only thing is accomplishes is to reinforce your feelings of superiority. That is a negative accomplishment because feeling superior and acting that way makes other people avoid you over time. People won't want to talk to you, so you won't get told information that would help you. People won't want to be on a team with you, so you will get assigned gradually to less and less important projects. Consider if you were the person who just graduated, would you want people to congratulate you? Then follow the Golden Rule and do the same for her. Being nice to people doen't mean you approve of everything they do. 

I am currently working as an intern (with a good pay). I have had trouble on my project, and took more time than what was expected of me to find what was wrong with a part of it. Now the deadline is coming, and I know I can't make it. Since the internship is almost over (2 weeks left), and I'm not studying in the same city, I can't continue working for this company after it is done. I am not supposed to work more than X hours per week, and I am not entitled to any sort of overtime. On the other hand, the schedule is flexible, so it is possible to work more hours on certains days and fewer on other, as long as we do X hours a week. In that case, I could work about 5-6 extra hours while still staying withing the allowed work hours, before that deadline. I care a lot more about making a good impression on my employers, so that I can either get hired there after I'm done with school, or at least get a decent recommendation, than I care about the money. I wouldn't mind at all working those extra hours and not saying anything, so essentially doing those hours without pay. My main question is: Are there are downsides, like breaking some sort of law (I am in Canada), to doing this unpaid overtime without saying anything, to make the deadline? On the other hand, how bad would it be for me if I failed to do it on time, when talking about recommendation letters and resumes? They originally thought this project would take 2 days for a full time employee, so they gave me a week to do it. Since I couldn't finish, they gave me an extra week, but mentioned that this was the longest they could give me, because after that my manager (who has to see the project to give his ok) will leave for some time, and we probably won't see each other before the end of my intership. I know I'm a lot behind schedule, and I am fully accepting that it is my fault. I didn't know the programming language very well, so ran into many unexpected problems that I didn't solve fast enough. 

HR has to put together the benefit package and the offer financially. They sometimes have to deal with other managers and Finance to get the right amount approved. They may be determining what pay scale your experience qualifies you for and where in the salary range of that payscale do they think you will fit. If you have asked for more than their payscale for a Dev1, they may be deciding if you can qualify for a Dev2 and if the budget is there for such a thing. Often what HR wants to pay, what Finance says they can pay and what the manager wants to pay are at odds and these things require negotiation. They may be checking with other people involved in the interview process to make sure all of them want to hire you. They need to make sure the vacancy can still be filled (things like company wide hiring freezes happen or changes to the budget). They may be checking references. Background checks could happen if they have already had you fill out the forms for such. At this time of year (the question was asked in Dec), the people they need to discuss things with may be on vacation as many companies have use or lose vacation time. In fact, if you are in a mostly Christian country, it may be very unlikely they will get the offer out until next year due to that. The 2017 budget for new hires might be used up or possibly some things from the 2018 budget are not yet set. Such as whether there is any budget at all due to the government not approving their budget and putting a stop to all government contracts for instance. They may even delay if they are in the process of setting up a layoff or hiring freeze that the hiring manager is not yet aware of. They generally won't make an offer until they know they have the budget to hire you. Or they may be busy with other tasks like setting up the 2018 benefits for the whole company or a corporate merger or filling a higher priority vacancy. 

Being fresh out of school, many interview processes will ask for a resume and a copy of my latest official grades from college/university. I happen to have one of the classes I have taken, that was particularly relevant to my field, that had me finish with a terrible, but still passing, grade. (I needed 60 to pass, and got 61.4). I figured that there must be many people who pass by the skin of their teeth, therefore it shouldn't be such a surprise to an employer. But I also happen to have very good grades in basically every other course, almost always above 85, so I don't want to come across as one of the people who pass with bad grades because of their abilities. The thing is, I almost failed that class because I skipped the final exam, that was Worth 35% of the grade. This is because I had two final exams that were scheduled at the exact same time, so I went to the other one, since I could pass that course without it (I would have failed the other course by missing their exam). I had tried basically everything with the school to either move or retake one of them, but the only options available were creating other conflicts, therefore not solving the problem. I was following a non-standard study path, and ended up with many courses that were not expected to be taken at the same time during that semester. How can I explain that grade without sounding like I'm making excuses, in the context of a job interview? I feel like I have a good reason, but I guess everyone probably feels that way and the interviewer most likely heard every excuse in the book already.
