Hint You are probably working with (or given) a linear demand function of the form $Q=\frac{a}{b}-\frac1bP$, or its equivalent inverse form $P=a-bQ$, where $a$ and $b$ are positive numbers. Given that price elasticity of demand at the optimum is $-1$, which you were right to point out (assuming linear demand), you can use the elasticity formula \begin{equation} -1=\frac{\mathrm dQ}{\mathrm dP}\cdot\frac{P}{Q}=-\frac1b\cdot\frac{P}{Q} \end{equation} and the demand equation to solve for the two unknowns $P$ and $Q$. 

Let $F$ and $G$ be two distributions with the same mean. $F$ is said to second order stochastically dominate (SOSD) $G$ if $$\int u(x)\mathrm dF(x)\ge \int u(x)\mathrm dG(x)\tag{1}$$ for all increasing and concave $u(\cdot)$. This above definition is equivalent to $$\int_{-\infty}^x F(t)\mathrm dt\le \int_{-\infty}^xG(t)\mathrm dt,\qquad\forall x\in\mathbb R.\tag{2}$$ I was told that the requirement for $F$ and $G$ to have the same mean is not really necessary. Suppose $F$ and $G$ do not have the same mean. Can we then still have the equivalence between $(1)$ and $(2)$? N.B. I was able to show $(2)\Rightarrow (1)$ without the same mean condition, but not the other way around. 

I'm not really an expert on the subject, but for welfare reforms I've been suggested to read Grogger and Karoly: "Welfare Reform: Effects of a Decade of Change" (2009) in the past. I believe it tackles at least some of the subjects you're thinking about and might be a good place to start. 

Chiang is probably the best you can find, but you might try Takayama - Mathematical Economics or Simon and Blume - Mathematics for Economists. 

Brazil raising interest rates probably refers to the central bank raising their interest rate which means that it is more costly for banks to loan money from the government and therefore the amount of money in circulation (as per quantity theory) should go down. It is a policy decision (possibly wrong depending on who you ask) in a difficult economic situation where a country faces both inflation and a downturn. Your logic about the economy becoming even weaker might very well be true (and I'd agree with lowering rates being a better option). The questions about effects to trade are slightly more complex and not necessarily as straightforward. 

I think you're referring to the criterion of payoff dominance in equilibrium selection. This idea can be attributed to Harsanyi and Selten (1988): 

An Introduction to Quantum Game Theory by J. Orlin Grabbe. There is also a related question on MathOverflow, answered by Steven Landsburg (also a member of Econ.SE) that might be of interest to you. 

Hint 1: Suppose a mixed strategy NE $(\sigma_1,\sigma_2)$ exists, where $\sigma_i$ is a distribution over $[0,1]$. By the property of MSNE, $$u_i(x_i,\sigma_j)=u_i(x_i',\sigma_j)$$ for all pure strategies $x_i,x_i'$ in the support of $\sigma_i$. Hint 2: Note that a segment of $u_i$ is linear in strategies, and thus $$ x_i+\frac12(1-x_i-\mathbb E[x_j])=x_i'+\frac12(1-x_i'-\mathbb E[x_j]) $$ 

VC is not exactly the sum of MC but the integral of it. A sum is the discrete analog of an integral. I think you've been told this to help with intuitive comprehension. In general, \begin{equation} TC(Q)=FC+VC(Q) \end{equation} where $FC$ is independent of $Q$. To get MC, we take the derivative of TC with respect to $Q$: \begin{equation} MC(Q)=\frac{\mathrm dTC(Q)}{\mathrm dQ}=\frac{\mathrm dVC(Q)}{\mathrm dQ}. \end{equation} The second equality obtains because differentiating a constant always give you zero. Now to get VC from MC, we need the reverse operation of differentiation, which is integration, i.e. \begin{equation} VC(Q)=\int_0^{Q}MC(q)\,\mathrm dq. \end{equation} In your example, given $MC(Q)=10+\frac14Q$ and $Q=200$, \begin{equation} VC(200)=\int_0^{200}\left(10+\frac14q\right)\mathrm dq=\left.10q+\frac18q^2\right\vert_0^{200}=10(200)+\frac{200^2}{8}=7000 \end{equation} 

You're probably not looking for a complex scientifical discussion on the subject, so here's a very simplified description of the mechanism: Lower interest rate => Loaning money is cheaper => More money in the system => Higher inflation. So the change in inflation is one of the products of government/central bank changing interest rates. 

I think @DornerA gave a good answer for reasoning behind the mechanism. For a historical example, look no further than the fiscal crisis and the rapid increase in gold price from 2008-2011. 

Real GDP (or even nominal GDP) is probably the most often used measurement of growth. Can you give an example of a country where real GDP constantly grows, but real GDP per capita fluctuates between positive and negative growth? This seems, at first glance, like a very theoretical idea as it would require large fluctuations in population growth which is usually quite constant. The recent migrations might be a special case where you might find something like this happening in the short run, but the effect will probably vary by country with different statistical methods (for example, there are differences between countries about when an asylum seeker enters the population). 

Note that all four possible stage-game outcomes are observed. As a result, if a player $i$ is playing any other strategy $s_i^O$, her payoff $u_i(s_i^O,s_j^T)$ can be expressed as some convex combination of the payoffs from playing either of the above three strategies. That is, there exists $\alpha,\beta\in[0,1]$ with $\alpha+\beta\le1$ such that, for any $s_i^O\in S_i$, \begin{equation} u_i(s_i^O,s_j^T)=\alpha u_i(s_i^T,s_j^T) +\beta u_i(s_i^A,s_j^T) +(1-\alpha-\beta)u_i(s_i^N,s_j^T). \end{equation} Now if you established that $u_i(s_i^T,s_j^T)\ge u_i(s_i^A,s_j^T)$ and $u_i(s_i^T,s_j^T)\ge u_i(s_i^N,s_j^T)$, which I assume you have done, it must follow that $u_i(s_i^T,s_j^T)\ge u_i(s_i^O,s_j^T)$ for any other strategy $s_i^O$. 

Macroeconomics nowadays tend to require microfoundations. As a result, general equilibrium are more of a topic for macro than micro analysis. The dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model and its variants underlie much of macroeconomic analysis nowadays. Standard texts: 

$m(\mathbf p,\mathbf x)$ specifies the minimum amount of money required for a consumer to attain the same utility as consuming bundle $\mathbf x$, taking prices $\mathbf p$ as given. In other words, since all bundles on the same indifference curve as $\mathbf x$ have the same utility value, and to achieve this utility, one needs at least an income of $m(\mathbf p,\mathbf x)$, we can thus establish a one-to-one mapping between utility levels and income levels. As utility is ordinal, we could as well use income as our utility measure. This does not, however, suggest that the consumer's budget line is converted to her indifference curve; the two remain distinct objects. To see this, consider a two-goods case. With fixed prices, the slope of the budget line is $p_2/p_1$, which is constant for all $\mathbf x$'s. In contrast, the slope of the indifference curves is generally a non-constant function over $\mathbf x$: \begin{equation} \frac{\partial x_2}{\partial x_1}=\frac{\partial e(\mathbf p,u(\mathbf x))/\partial x_1}{\partial e(\mathbf p,u(\mathbf x))/\partial x_2}=\frac{MU_1(\mathbf x)}{MU_2(\mathbf x)}\,. \end{equation} The money metric utility function simply changes the unit of utility measurement from utils to dollars, which is legitimate thanks to the ordinality of utility. It does not change the underlying mathematical objects in any substantive way, though. 

Is anyone aware of a study where health insurance rates would be dependent on body fat? It would, of course, be difficult to define when someone is overweight, but lets say being vastly overweight would increase the rates. After a short search I found this: $URL$ but it studies the effect of insurance on body weight and not the other way around. 

The recommended books are decent. From these two I'd go with Bailey first and if you're comfortable with that, then LeRoy & Werner. The latter requires some background in linear algebra and optimization theory. If you want to study some econometric applications for financial economics, you might try: 

If I understood this correctly, you're just looking to draw simple graphs? If you're not willing to create functions in a program like R or similar, I'd suggest a simple solution: the drawing function in Google Drive. Open Google Drive and then open Google Drawings. It is actually pretty good and easy to learn for basic graphs. 

Most of what you have done was correct. Here are the steps to finish the argument. Evaluating the profits at the optimum, you get \begin{equation} \pi_G=R(y^*(t))-C(y^*(t)) \quad\text{and}\quad \pi_N=R(y^*(t))-C(y^*(t))-ty^*(t). \end{equation} Differentiate the net profits with respect to $t$: \begin{align} \frac{\mathrm d\pi_N}{\mathrm dt}&=R'(y^*)\frac{\mathrm dy^*}{\mathrm dt}-C'(y^*)\frac{\mathrm dy^*}{\mathrm dt}-t\frac{\mathrm dy^*}{\mathrm dt}-y^*\\&=\underbrace{[R'(y^*)-C'(y^*)-t]}_{=0 \text{ due to FOC}}\frac{\mathrm dy^*}{\mathrm dt}-y^*<0, \end{align} which is true assuming $y^*>0$. Differentiate the gross profits with respect to $t$: \begin{align} \frac{\mathrm d\pi_G}{\mathrm dt}&=R'(y^*)\frac{\mathrm dy^*}{\mathrm dt}-C'(y^*)\frac{\mathrm dy^*}{\mathrm dt}=[R'(y^*)-C'(y^*)]\frac{\mathrm dy^*}{\mathrm dt}<0. \end{align} This is true because from the FOC, we know that for any positive tax, $R'(y^*)-C'(y^*)>0$, and since you've correctly derived $\frac{\mathrm dy^*}{\mathrm dt}<0$, their product must be negative. 

Repeated games are a special class of extensive form games. And to the extent that such games admit a strategic form representation, the usual dominance notions apply: 

If you happen to know that the "normal form" is sometimes also referred to as the strategic form, you'd most likely not be surprised that it doesn't help you distinguish between the notions of action and strategy. The normal form is precisely used to represent strategies (not actions) in a game. To appreciate the difference between strategies and actions, it's probably best to consider another form of game representation: the extensive form. Suppose 2 players move sequentially, and that Player 2 observes Player 1's choice before making his decision. The scenario can be represented using a game tree as follows: 

If you're really serious about researching this data, I'd suggest contacting the Real Estate Institution of New Zealand: $URL$ As long as there are reasons to move to Auckland (more work etc.) and the supplied housing is not high enough to match the demand, the prices will continue to rise. This effect is visible in many major cities where the supply of housing is (for some reason like goverment rules or slow building) inelastic. 

Deaton's "Understanding Consumption" (1993) was one of the major sources I used when doing seminar work for my master's. In the end I decided to write my thesis about a different (somewhat related) subject after realising the empirical difficulties with what I planned on doing. I have since chosen a different research subject, but Understanding Consumption is a book I have spent many hours with. It's a bit dated now, but still a decent read if you want to know about consumption and saving. 

If we think of a discount factor, $\delta$, as the probability of survival to the next period and the utility of death is normalized to $0$, then a simple intertemporal utility function can be written as $$ u(x_t)+\delta u(x_{t+1})+(1-\delta)u(\text{death})=u(x_t)+\delta u(x_{t+1}), $$ where the argument in the utility function can either be consumption goods (your case 1) or financial assets (your case 2). Arthur Robson also proposes that time preferences have, aside from possible mortality, deeper evolutionary underpinnings, which has to do with the growth rate of offspring. See Robson and Samuelson (2007), Robson and Samuelson (2009), and Robson and Szentes (2014). 

A comment on the number of players in signaling games in general. Signaling games need not have only two players. In the cheap talk literature, there are papers that study signaling games with multiple informed senders and one uninformed receiver (e.g. Krishna & Morgan, 2001), or one informed sender with multiple uninformed receivers (e.g. Farrel and Gibbons, 1989). There are no theoretical reasons to limit the number of players to two. Is it possible to have a signaling game in which all players are both informed (about themselves) and uniformed (about other players)? The answer is yes. For example, auctions with pre-play communication, where each bidder is informed about their own valuations of the object but not about the others'. In the communication stage, they use signals to strategically (mis-)communicate their private information, and to infer about other bidders' types from their signals (e.g. Mathews and Postlewaite, 1988). In general, mechanism design is about signaling privately observed types. But the specific model depends on what you want to do after the signaling stage, whether signals are costly, and what kind of outcome you want the model to deliver, etc. 

I'm guessing the author has split the series between a trend component and noise component, for example with the HP-filter, and studies the smooth trend component. 

I don't know if you're arguing a theoretical framework or whether saving is important for real economic growth. In theory a special case where all consumers would spend 100 % (MPC=1) of their income is possible to argue - the framework would be loaded with questions - it might, for example, make banks redundant. In basic economic models savings is often considered equal to investment (you see a variation of S=I in many macroeconomic models) which means that all saved income is used for investment and therefore expected to expand the economy for future periods. In real life the relationship isn't quite this straightforward, but the basic idea still holds.
