The derailleur is, unfortunately, one of those critical parts that is very hard to protect from damage; without sacrificing another part. As Batman pointed out, you can purchase small hoops that attach to your frame and offer some protection. As he pointed out though, these types of products might protect the derailleur to some degree, but you risk transferring those damaging forces to the frame in a crash. Besides that, a derailleur is constantly moving and is very exposed to anything that might knock, touch or grab it. There really isn't a whole lot you can do. It is easier said than done, but try not to fall as much. Pick your lines carefully through rocks and keep an eye out for anything that will snag it. If you lay your bike down on the ground, always make sure to lay it with the brakes facing the ground, in order to not put the weight of the bike on the derailleur. One thing that I must ask, is if your derailleur has been damaged multiple times; during any of those incidents, did your derailleur hanger suffer damage? If the hanger has not ever been bent or snapped, maybe it is too stiff/strong and not taking any of damaging forces. I have always had bad luck with very soft hangers that snap prematurely. Try to find a lower quality one and use that. Maybe next time the hanger will bend instead of your derailleur. Another thing that should be mentioned that every time you bend the derailleur back into its correct position, it gets a little weaker. It will bend under pressure that much easier each further time it is put under stress. Parts get fatigued and sometimes must be replaced, even if they still appear to be semi-functioning. Sometimes it just comes down to luck at the time of an incident. Sometimes you take a spill and come out of it with zero broken parts. Other times, you can be looking at major damage to something (even from the most innocent of crashes). 

You say that putting the pannier on the opposite side of the bike makes the problem worse. This makes me think the bike isn't well balanced on the stand. The stand may be too short for the bike, so that the bike leans too much. Try putting a block of wood under the stand. If that helps, get a stand with a longer arm (or leg, what is that part called?). The stand may be angled too much to the front. This would allow the load to pull the bike so it pivots around the stand until it falls. A stand that is angled back may help. 

You want a torque wrench that's made for the range of torques that you expect to use. A wrench with too large a range will give you limited precision in the range you need. Basically, it will be harder to tell if you are applying the correct torque. One that's too small won't let you apply the required torque. The accuracy of the reading may also be important. For example, this wrench (which I found with a Google search so it's not a recommendation) has a range of 20 to 108 Nm with a 4% accuracy. Some people prefer a wrench that clicks when a preset torque is reached so they know when to stop. Others feel that reading from a scale works well enough. There's a discussion at $URL$ that may be helpful to you. 

The problem could be the lubrication on the rear hub. Perhaps it wasn't well greased at the factory. A tune-up should have caught this problem, particularly as you mentioned it. Another possibility is that there is a ball bearing missing from the rear hub, so that once every time the wheel turns around, the axle falls into the small gap created by the missing bearing (this happened on my daughter's new bike after about 3 months of occasional riding). If the bike is still under warranty, then I would take it in. The problem should have been fixed the first time. If you want to try fixing it yourself, you will have to take off the rear wheel and disassemble the hub. This isn't hard, but if you've never done it before, try finding a local bike shop that will show you how. Some towns have co-op bike repair shops where for a small fee you can use their tools and there will be a mechanic on hand to guide you. (for example Ottawa - $URL$ Waterloo - $URL$ Try looking at this wiki for a shop near you. 

As Alesplin puts it, it is common practice to stay off of trails that are muddy. I'd like to expand on his answer a little. I think there are a few factors that come into play with a question like this. One of the biggest contributors of damage to a muddy trail is large amounts of traffic. The more people that use the trail, the more damage will be done. If you are one of a few people to use a trail, you most likely won't do any permanent damage. The worst thing you will do is create ruts, that when dry are not the nicest things to ride on/in. Ruts can also lead to other forms of damage. A rut will collect water, which will not run off the trail. Quite often, these puddles of water will get bigger and bigger until they consume the width of the trail. This, I think, is when the real damage occurs. Trail users (both rides and hikers) will most often avoid going through the standing water and simply go around (at the cost of the surrounding vegetation). This can lead to parts of the trail being expanded unnecessarily, and there will still be the problem of the expanding rutted water hole in the middle of the trail. In the end, if the trail is used very lightly, riding in the mud will not do much damage at all. For most trails though, it is best to avoid the muddy ones. Of course, there are always sections of trail that are muddy, no matter what. Those are a whole other matter of how to properly build and route a trail. Get dirty and have fun. 

It is very possible that during assembly, the pieces were missed. Try to see if you can shift the seat-stay or chain-stay sideways on the pivot. If you can, you definitely need to find another bushing to fit in there. If there is sideways play in that pivot, it will wear out prematurely. You'll also get all sorts of dirt and debris stuck in there, which will also wear out the pivot much quicker than if it were covered with a bushing. Another thing you could do is go to a brick and mortar store that sells the same brand of bike and see if the bikes in the store are also missing them. 

In theory there's nothing wrong with that idea. In practice there are a few things you'll need to consider. 

Am I correct in thinking (based on your PinkBike comment) that you've never personally participated in a DH race? I would very highly recommend you compete in a few before trying to put on one of your own. There's a ton of things you'll need to think about, and the best way to get a good list is by attending one yourself and looking around with a critical eye. Off the top of my head, other things you need to prepare 

So, for starters, I wouldn't worry too much about damaging the seat post--it's likely that you'll need a new one anyway. Or you'll need to really buff the post off, and that will remove any scratches. Eventually, though, I would recommend getting an aluminum post, that will help keep this from happening again (see my next point). Secondly, yes, it is almost certainly rusted together. I would be very surprised to learn that someone had forced (successfully) a 30.2mm seat post in to a 30mm seat tube. Particularly because there are no obvious deformations in either piece. However, things rusting and sticking together is very common, but perhaps not in the bike world. So, on to the crux of the question: how to get it apart? I think you're on to something using a pipe wrench to try to twist it free. You should also use some sort of penetrating lubricant to help get it loose. Personally I like PB Blaster, but WD-40 is similar. Spray it down, and let it soak in for a few minutes (if you have the bottom bracket off, you may try turning the bike over and spraying it in to the bottom of the seat tube, might not hurt). You can also try hitting the frame/post with a mallet to break it apart a bit. I know this sounds like voodoo, but getting rusted stuff apart usually comes down to brute force and ignorance. And lube. If you're really desperate you can heat the seat tube with a blow torch while you work the post loose, but that will risk blistering the paint on the frame (also lighting the PB Blaster on fire, so be careful with that). Godspeed.
