I read a few paper related to emission inventory talking about the inverse modeling. It was another method to estimate the emission from ground(called method). The satellite sensor usually support the product with vertical column density() for certrain species. The target here seems to be generate the relationship between emission and VCD. In my opinion, there are some uncertainty hidden here: (1) the gridded VCD of certain species can be formed by different precursors, transported from neighborhood area. (2) The chemistry system in the model also has some inherent bias which would miss some crucial source or sink process. (3) When we set source inventory as input for chemistry transport model, the height information and the specific location are two crucial parameters. In the area of inverse modeling, we know nothing about the information of real sources(i.e fire spot, power plant). How to generate a relative precise relationship between satellite data and source emission in consideration of these doubts? 

In the visible band, the scattering of gases can be omitted and the absorption of gases is mainly attributed to $NO_2$. As an empirical equation, the $b_{ext}$ can be derived as follows: $$b_{ext} = 3f(RH)*[(NH_4)_2SO_4] + 3f(RH)*[(NH_4)_2SO_4] + 4f(RH)*[Organics] + 10[EC]+[Soil] +[0.6][Coarse\ mass]+ 3.3*[NO_2]+ 10 $$ 

The real-time data are also presented here a supplement. I choose Beijing, Xi'an (two large city in China), Zhoushan(an island in Eastern China Sea), Sanya(nearby the southern China Sea) 

To analysis the temporal pattern of one species, e.g, the formation of O3,isolating the chemical reaction as an independent part. I want to eliminate the wind factors (including the wind direction and speed). 

The other factor which was similar with the factor in the source profile. High mass loading of As, Cd, Pb was also founded. Meanwhile, this factor presented elevated contribution only at the site near surface coal mining zone. Therefore, I thought this factor should be the emission of coal mining activity. Information of the coal mining Responding to first answer, I investigated the coal mining activity in this area. Here is an figure of one of the coal strip mine and the coal is mined by mechanical cutting techniques. 

We can derive that the aerosol is the dominant reason of the visibility loss. PS: the gases species can also impact the radiative transfer process of the earth system, but mainly in non-visible regions. 2. The calculation of visibility loss Koschmiederp came up with an equation which connect the visibility and extinction coefficient $b_{ext}$ as follows: $$V_R = 3.91/b_{ext} $$ 

Although this is a simple data visualization, I think there are some valuable information in the figures. I have found several points that may be interesting, but I can't explain them well. (1) The diurnal variations of PM2.5 in different seasons are more similar comparing with PM10. (2) The peak hour in winter for both species are late for 1 hour comparing with other seasons in the daytime. (3) The concentration levels of both species between daytime and nighttime for spring are more close than other seasons PS: Some background of the case area 

Question I also want to distinguish the sampling days as ''photochemistry active days" or "photochemistry inhibited days". Is there any quantitative indexes to help me to identify the days with the photochemistry reactions are negligible? I have thought about some simple variables relating to photochemistry cycles. 

One factor can be identified in all sites, with high mass loading of Na, Cr, As, Zn, Pb. These trace elements existing in coal can be volatilized in high temperature combustion processes and then coagulated into solid phase in atmosphere. The seasonal variability of this factor also show the trend of highest contribution in winter. It might indicate the increasing coal combustion for domestic heating which is common in north China. Thus, I inferred this factor was the emission from coal combustion (coal-fired power/heating plant and domestic uses of bulk coal). 

The lecture has depict the air pollution trends and regulation situation from 1950s till 2000s. May it help! 

These two nearby cities are in the distance less than 60 Km, has the similar PM2.5 conc with different O3 conc 

A figure downloaded from this site. It represent the history trends of the pollutants related to the photochemical pollution from 1960s to 2000s 

Is there any other issues counted in the simulation work. Any comments or recommended material would be highly appreciated. 

I use WRF (Weather research and forecasting) model for in regional scale meteorology simulation. And then, the WRF output files will be deemed as criterial input data applying for chemical transport model(e.g CMAQ, CAMx). The meteorology information are very important for chemical species in the atmosphere. It will influence its emission, diffusion, transportation and removal process and thereby determine the distribution of chemical in horizontal and vertical scales(healthy effect and climate effect related). Since the importance of meteorology mode output data, the model evaluation process is essential before applying WRF output file for further use. Several papers I have read mainly has the similar method that introducing some land-based station data(e.g NCDC) within the simulation area and compare them using statistic method. Usually, we use point-to-point statistic metrics to estimate the similarity of observed data and simulation data in nearest grid in value(MB, RMSE, NMB, NME) and temporal variation(R). But I have some doubt here (1) The land-based data is the physics parameters collected from one specific spot and the corresponding WRF output grid data is the average value of the whole area(e.g 9 km^2). They represent the meteorology condition in different scale. What's more, if the station spot is near or at the boundary of grid system, how do we choose the best grid indices? (2) We always regard the land-based observation data as 'true' value. But the instruments also have its own errors. If the observed data has large bias with 'true' physics process, it should be considered as useless. How do we evaluate the observed data itself and analysis it with certain uncertainty? (3) More detailly, the WRF output data 2-m temperature(RH) and 10-m wind direction/wind are directly used for point-to-point difference. Does it reasonable to compare in these altitude or the value has little difference in several meters range. I think this problem not just exist in WRF model. The air quality model evaluation may has the same issue when comparing simulated value with observed concentration. Is there any more advanced method? Any one has some thought about this question can share your valuable opinion here! 

Does anyone familiar with the OMI-NO2 data? I don't know how to deal with the irregular value which are way too higher than realistic. 

We can find that $O_3$, $PAN$, $VOCs$, $NO_x$ have all declined. And O3 variation trends were strongly correlated to $NO_x$ which can be explained by the VOC-NOx chemistry. Another material I have searched out was a class lecture downloaded here. It introduced the contents below: 

As the figure illustrated Paper links, the trajectories are clustered into several groups. The different fraction of chemical species (e.g, organic matters, sulfate) in each group shows the impact of different regional. It represent an easy approach to research the impact of regional transportation for the particulate matters in certain receptors. But I have a question here: 

1. Basic concepts of visibility loss The deterioration of visibility can be divided into four parts as follows: 

I am not well satisfied with my interpretation on the apportionment results. I will be grateful if some researchers shed some light on this issue. More information on the sampling sites PM samples are simultaneously collected in six sites within the studied area in daily basis. As a energy base area, there are 8 coal-fired power stations within this area. Site 1 was located near coal mine as the following figure. 

Background In the area of atmospheric chemistry, many species have the primary origins and secondary formation pathway. For example, organic aerosols can be emitted directly from fuel combustion, vegetation debris, etc., and also can be formed by photochemical reactions of volatile organic compounds To identify the primary/secondary formed organic aerosol by measurement approach is difficult, while this information is essential for air quality management and epidemiologic studies. I have read a paper Comparison of SOC estimates and uncertainties from aerosol chemical composition and gas phase data in Atlanta, which discussed four methods to estimate secondary formed organic carbon. In the paper, the author defined the day with low photochemical activity: 

I'm dealing with NO2 column density of troposphere, and my data source is TEMIS. The NO2 level3 data can be derived from the original information of OMI instrument. I have downloaded two types of data, .grd and .kml for the same month. The data I have downloaded are uploaded here1, 2 KML data I open it in Google Earth, the figure shows like this: We can see the data range of NO2 trop. column is 0~20 which are idential to the templete figure on the website. GRD data I have not found any detailed information about this data. In the contents of it, is deemed as no_data place. I use python to read and plot the spatial distribution. 

In this way, the visibility loss can be rebuilt. We can derive that the "there is a relationship between the concentrations of the chemical and the optical depth/visibility" as your second question. 3. Mass concentration and visibility A figure I clipped from Chen et al., 2016 represent the relationship between $PM_{2.5}$ concentration and visibility. We can see the visibility is decrease when $PM_{2.5}$ increasing and the decreasing curve is sharp when the concentration is below 50 ${u}g/m^3$. Besides, relative humility is a key factor here which high RH can worsen the deterioration of visibility. This is due to the hygroscopic behavior of some species (eg. $(NH_4)_2SO_4$) 

From some paper which elucidating the chemical species of aerosol from certain sample points, backward trajectories analysis are usually applied for identifying the potential geographical source region. 

In the area of atmospheric chemistry, I have learned that the heterogeneous oxidation of SO2 is one of the important pathways for sulfate formation. The reactions of SO2 oxidation in mineral, soot particles have been confirmed. The adsorption or uptake of SO2 on the particle surface" is the initial process of the transformation. I have heard that adsorption is the surface-based process of gases or ions and create a film wiki reference. What's the difference between the adsorption and uptake processes?
