There is a Ph.D. thesis on this topic, written by Marian Newsome Moorhead in 2005, titled "The Suzuki Method: A comparative analysis of the perceptual/cognitive listening development in third grade students trained in the Suzuki, traditional, and modified Suzuki music methods." Basically, a bunch of students taught in the Suzuki (which emphasizes rote learning over theory) and some other methods were asked to complete specific musical games. Their performance was then analyzed and compared. The Suzuki students did the same or less well overall compared to some of the other groups. The author tentatively suggests that "cognitive scaffolding" (music theory and such as absent in the Suzuki method) is important for early music acquisition, concluding that:

You often hear a variation on the idea that plants "absorb" air pollution. For example, in a Yahoo News article on Beijing smog, the reporter writes: 

By comparison, an article in the Journal of Arboriculture 29(2): March 2003 indicates that the city of Davis, California 

Based on this literature review, I would conclude that cupping research is dangerously close to being a pseudo-science. I was not able to find any studies in mainstream journals like the New England Journal of Medicine or the British Medical Journal. †Please note that this answer does not constitute medical advice.

The search for "neurogenic shock circumcision" returns zero results on pubMed, which is the largest database of medical literature in English. The closest thing I could find is "American Society for Pain Management Nursing (ASPMN) Position Statement: Male Infant Circumcision Pain Management," which states: 

In Meat and Livestock Australia criticised for advert of vegetarian Hindu God Ganesha, it's claimed that the Hindu deity Ganesha is regarded as vegetarian: 

Has this plant been traditionally used this way, and is there any evidence for or against its use against viruses? I tried pubmedding for Dracontium, and the only relevant article appears to be this one, where the abstract talks about anti-bacterial properties, not anti-viral ones. I also googled, but mainly came up with alternative medicine sites. Declaration of conflicts: I do research on how HIV mutates. I also used to be associated with the Encyclopedia of Life, which I linked to above. 

The Beginner's Guide to C++, from 1994, by the Russian-sounding name Oleg Yaroshenko also uses the phrase. FBIS Daily Report: Central Eurasia, Issues 241-252, published in 1992, quotes someone saying that both the Russians and the Chinese have this expression. There's a couple of scenarios I can think of: 

Is preventing police abuse an accurate and complete description of Horne's actions, and was she fired soon afterwards and denied her pension? 

The United States isn't necessarily the richest country even with the top 5% wealth holders. I'm not sure if GDP is a perfect measure of wealth, but it should be closely correlated. If you go by nominal GDP, then Wikipedia lists Luxemborg as the highest, with the US in 14th place. If you go by purchasing power parity GDP, then Wikipedia lists Qatar as the highest, with the United States in 7th place. If you think Luxemborg and Qatar are too small to count, then Norway does better than the United States on both counts, and has a population of approximately 5 million. 

Wikipedia's article on Jeff Greene indicates that he's a billionaire, so he can afford a private jet plane, and that he has a luxury yacht, which means that he's likely to own and use a private jet plane. It also indicates that he's politically active. The main thing I'm skeptical about is whether the first sentence is incorrect and/or taken out of context. The Bloomberg article doesn't link to a transcript of the interview in question.

In analyzing the activities of APT1, "a single organization of operators that has conducted a cyber espionage campaign against a broad range of victims" and "one of the most prolific cyber espionage groups in terms of the sheer quantity of information stolen," Mandiant posits that "that APT1 is likely government-sponsored and one of the most persistent of China’s cyber threat actors." In their opinion: 

Moreover, the same paper concludes that "in the case of mice infected with influenza virus, ion-deprivation increases the cumulative mortality rate" and "since ion depletion is a constant concomitant of modern urban life, one reasonably may speculate about comparable inimical effects on humans." A study published in the Journal of Applied Microbiology in 2009 finds ionization "to be an effective method for reduction in surface and airborne bacteria." In this study ionizers were installed inside refrigerators, and although effective the amount of reduction depended "the constructional layout and material properties of the ionizer housing, air circulation within the refrigerator and the interior volume" or the refrigerator. An earlier study in the Journal of Food Protection concludes that "high levels of negative air ions can have a significant impact on the airborne microbial load, and that most of this effect is through direct killing of the organisms." By contrast, a study done in 2007 by the School of Civil Engineering, University of Leeds suggests that "the bactericidal action attributed to negative air ions by previous researchers may have been overestimated." To summarize then, it seems that ionizers can indeed reduce the airborne bacterial load but could also be bad for humans. A reasonable piece of advice comes from the same 1976 article in Science quoted above, which recommends to "maintain air ion concentrations and ratios approximating those existing in nature" and expresses hope that "air ion levels of urban air will approach those of clean rural air."

Do objective studies confirm that compared to other countries, Australia is or was an egalitarian country? 

A website called Hispanically Speaking News claims that McDonald's is closing its restaurants in Bolivia. A search of Google News has only a handful of mentions of this story, whereas I would have expected it to make major news, if only in the finance sections of newspapers. The article mentions a documentary called "Why did McDonald’s Bolivia go Bankrupt", supposedly made by McDonalds - I'm wondering if this is fake news being pushed in order to promote the documentary, made by someone other than McDonald's. There are, however, reports from relatively mainstream news sites about it leaving in 2002, for example the BBC posted the article Burger King cheers Big Mac retreat. 

In Captain Paul Watson: Fear and Loathing of Sharks in Western Australia, Sea Shepherd founder Paul Watson (warning: Islamophobic content elsewhere in the article) says 

Which suggest that there were some posters out there with the message of speaking American. Not necessarily those two photos, but they did exist. However, it's possible that the second photo is fake. $URL$ is a deletion request for a supposed poster saying "Speak American": 

In "The Imitation Game", most of the staff portrayed on-screen were male, and Joan Clarke faced sexist assumptions that because she's a woman, she was in the wrong room when she tried to go into the examination room for the cross-word solving test. However, a prominent programmer, Amy Wibowo, disputes this portrayal (from twitter, slightly re-written): 

The ABS talks about Luxembourg and the United States having higher per capita carbon dioxide emissions (which is different from all greenhouse gases). Wikipedia has a list of countries by greenhouse gas emissions per capita, but the data there is slightly out-dated. Is Australia the highest per capita emitter of greenhouse gases in the OECD? 

It shows a decline in male life expectancy from a peak of just under 65, to 57 and a bit, consistent with the initial graph. As that was the most striking feature of the graph, I doubt that the graph was fabricated by anti-nuclear activists. However, it is interesting to note that they only graphed male life expectancy. Male life expectancy dropped by almost 8 years, whereas female life expectancy dropped by less than four years. Deliberately choosing male life expectancy could be cherry-picking on the part of the anti-nuclear activists.
