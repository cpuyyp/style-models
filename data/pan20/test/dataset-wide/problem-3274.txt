There really isn't anything in particular that is raining, and yet, there needs to be a formal subject. The situation is similar in other languages, such as the other Germanic ones (such as German). Other languages, such as many of the romance languages, allow you to freely drop the subject. In Spanish, you can simply say, without a subject, 

Both of them mean that the cake (Kuchen, here in the accusative case) is eaten by the boy (Junge, in the nominative). Here it is case that tells us what is being eaten, and what is eating, not word order. In other situations, case is a similarly unreliable cue in German. In these situations, agreement - the specific form of the verb, being dependent in form on its arguments - may be required to help you figure out who does what to whom. For example, English "is" tells you the subject is singular, so if you come across a plural noun, you know it cannot be the subject. For a German example: 

Although verb order and overt case inflection are the same between those two, they mean different things; the first, that "women hate Peter", the second, that "Peter hates women". In the first one, the auxiliary "hat" is inflected to show that it agrees with a singular noun, Peter, so Peter must be the subject. In the second, "haben" must agree with a plural noun, Frauen. Bates & MacWhinney demonstrated that native speakers of German rely mostly on case, speakers of English on position, speakers of Italian on agreement. So in sum, in some languages, verb inflection can have very specific and important functions in sentence interpretation; in others, who often rely more on word order, not so much. In the specific case of the English auxiliary suppletiva am/is/are, their status as morphologically marked seems to be somewhat of a historic artefact from a time when precursors of English relied more on inflection.

However, while the subject is obligatory in many constructions in many languages, it is still possible to construct subject-free sentences, such as 

To begin with, depending on your understanding of "sentence", even in English you will find examples of well-formed utterances without verb or subject. For example, "Yes." may be a sentence. So the simple answer to your question is: no syntactic categories are essential. More interesting are certain patterns of grammatical dependence, which vary between languages. For example, in English, if you use a finite verb, you usually need a subject, too - if you leave out the subject, the sentence is elliptical. Consider talking about the weather: 

Some of these are elliptical, some aren't. The non-ellipcital ones do not feature indicative mood, indicating that it is not so much sentences requiring subjects to be expressed, but verbs. And that is basically your answer: sentences generally lack requirements. However, once you introduce certain words in certain functions, such as a verb in the indicative, they tend to have dependencies which must be expressed for a non-elliptical construction. However, even such dependencies can usually be omitted in specific contexts. 

The second sentence talks about a very dangerous mouse! However, in languages such as Italian and German, phrases may shift around somewhat freely within a sentence. For example, it is possible to say both 

One kind of answer one could give to this is psycholinguistic: what use do people make of such aspects of language? The answer is: plenty, depending on the language; not so much for specifically am/is/are. During language processing, they are often used to inform sentence interpretation by telling you who does what to whom. In the 70s and 80s, Bates & MacWhinney conducted extensive research on what kinds of cues speakers of various languages use to figure out what a sentence means. In English, word order is a highly reliable cue; what is directly in front of the verb tends to be the agent, what is directly after it, the patient (the situation is different in intransitive sentences, passive sentences ...). 

BEFORE (in the limited sense of a temporal comparison) is one of the Semantic Primes of the Natural Semantic Metalanguage. Though NSM researchers have not considered every language in existence, they have studied languages from every large family, so I'd consider this decent evidence that this is something every language will have. Note that the primes may be represent by affixes or phrases rather than just single words. 

"Individual, separate entity": this sounds like the semantic category of "specificify". By contrast, the semantic category of "definiteness" concerns identifiability. You use definite markers when you think your listeners can identify the referents of your noun phrases, and you use indefinite markers when you think your listeners would not be able to identify the referents. When you say "I made a mistake", you know what the mistake is, but your listeners do not because this is the first time that they've heard about it. If you go on to explain what the mistake is, then it becomes appropriate to say "the mistake" because your listeners can now identify what you're talking about. Wikipedia gives a few helpful examples which show that the English articles, when they are present, do indeed mark definiteness (identifiability), not specificity. 

Most recently developed orthographies are phonemically straight forward - they become less ideal as time goes on and the spoken language goes under sound shifts, but the written language doesn't. Most of the languages SIL has worked with did not have an orthography before, so you'll be able to find many in their archive. 

All of these are ungrammatical which is strong evidence that these that phrases are not noun phrases. 

Each of these categories will have dozens of options when you look at all the world's languages, though an individual language will usually only have a few, if it marks the category at all. The things you list in your question are just some of the inflections you'll see, and some of them wouldn't even normally be considered to be inflections, as they are derivational! 

This is of course highly debated, but some linguists would answer yes, there is a small set of words/concepts common to all natural human languages. The major theory currently representing this view is the Natural Semantic Metalanguage, which posits that there are around 66 core 'semantic primes' which are both irreducible and universal. These primes are usually words, but some will in some languages be expressed by affixes or set phrases. 

Of course, it is also often said that Japanese does have pronouns. What arguments are used to answer this question? Does it stem from a lack of agreement over how to define a pronoun? If so, under which definitions does Japanese have and not have pronouns? 

The words themselves are of course not categories. They are however commonly considered to be the conventional grammaticalised means of conveying those categories. Many of them however have multiple senses, and they do not all convey modality in every sense. 

No, your example sentence is ungrammatical in English because the rules of English require that all singular countable nouns have some sort of determiner. 

It depends who you talk to, but I think there's some logic in saying that a clause is simply another name for a verb phrase. (Ignoring non-verbal clauses.) Two verbs mean two clauses. Infinitive arguments can have their own set of independent arguments and adjuncts. Here is a complex example, but I think it illustrates that there are two clauses quite clearly: 

My interpretation would be that the -miş suffix marks both inferential evidentiality and perfective aspect. It primarily contrasts with the perfective suffix -di. If you don't want the perfective aspect or its implied past tense, then you can use one of the compound sufixes to override the perfective part of -miş. 

The Natural Semantic Metalanguage is a framework which attempts to identify the basic semantic building blocks of human language, which they call "semantic primes." These words (sometimes affixes or phrases) are the base level semantic concepts on which everything else is built, and are argued to be present in every natural language. NSM researches have identified several distinct predicators. Although they all use is/be in English, in other languages they are conveyed with different words. 

While in English Romance languages and Germanic languages, the rendering of fractions usually corresponds to that of the ordinal numbers, i.e a fifth, and a sixth, a seventh, etc. ; it seems to me that conceptually, they are are a different entity. To highlight this, in Germanic and Romance languages there seem to be a few exceptions peppered in the lower numbers: English ½= a half 2nd = second , ¼= quarter vs. 4th= fourth. Spanish: ⅓ = um tercio 3º = tercero . All the texts I've read refer to the set of "half, third, quarter, fifth..." etc. as the "ordinal numbers" of a language. However, it seems to me they are a separate conceptual entity (innately; but also as demonstrated by the presence of the exceptions). Is there a linguistic term for the set of these words in a language? Are there any examples of languages which have a set of words (more than 2 or 3) for fractions that are different from both the ordinal number (e.g. "one third") or the cardinal (e.g. "one over three") numbers. 

As I understand it, in the original bible passage, Jesus says to Peter "And I tell you that you are Petros, and on this petra I will build my church, and the gates of Hades will not overcome it" And in the original Aramaic, the word used is also a noun which translates as "Rock" or "Stone". According to wikipedia Petros had not previously been used as a name, but in the Greek-speaking world it became a popular Christian name, after the tradition of Peter's prominence in the early Christian church had been established. In many Latin languages, Petros is rendered as a the word for rock/stone in that language. For example, French Pierre is both the name of the saint and a word for stone. In others, the gender changes (a rock is female and inflects at the end differently to the male name) but the relationship between the words is transparent. So how did stone come to be rendered in English as the opaque Peter when referring to person, Peter. It's obviously a cognate with the greek and latin words, but how did it enter the language and end up with its current spelling and pronunciation? My best guess is that is travelled as a given name across the channel before the bible was commonly read in English, as an Anglicised form of the Romance language name, and when the Bible was translated, it made sense to the translators to use the existing English name. But this is just my guess. 

These answers deal with the parts of our thoughts that take place in language, and yes, that is largely context dependent, as others have outlined. That is to say, if you're thinking about best way is to phrase something, or trying to understand a specific sentence you've just heard, then you'll think in the language you're thinking about. However, it's important to note that cognitive science shows us that most of our thoughts don't take part in any language at all. In fact, strictly speaking, thought precedes language. Generally the only time we think in language at all is is when we are thinking about language, thinking specifically about talking to people, or for some other reason we are deliberately putting our thoughts into words. Language is essentially a medium to express our thoughts, not the medium in which we think. So if I'm trying to decide what I'm going to say to my boss when I call up and phone in sick, I'll think about the words in whatever language I'm planning to speak to her. But, if I'm thinking about what I'm going to do with my sick day, planning what I'm going to have for dinner, thinking about how I feel about a particular person or thing, or remembering something I did the previous day; none of that takes place "in a language". There are various studies in cognitive science that bear this out, as well as (less scientific but useful to understanding) observations about day to day life. For example, after we hear a speech or a lecture, we remember the concepts but rarely the exact wording; these are recorded in a "raw" "language free" format. That is to say, unless a specific wording of a sentence jumps out at us for its poetic or aesthetic value, our brains don't remember a single individual sentence what we've just heard, and yet we retain the content. Now that's not to say that we can't memorise individual sentences word for word; we often choose to do this, and if a specific figure of speech jumps out at us as interesting then we might make a mental note of it word for word; but that doesn't mean we think in language any more than remembering the hook of a pop song means that we think in melody. Similarly, people who mutually speak more that one language with each other regularly often can't even remember in what language a specific conversation took place, but can remember the content. I can't remember the specific study, but I once read one where polyglots were given a short piece of text and then asked afterwards to say what it said. They took the same amount of time to do so regardless of whether they were summarising in the same language or a different language as the original; which showed that they weren't mentally "translating", just relaying the information they had absorbed, showing that information isn't coded in a specific language. For more on this I suggest you look into Steven Pinker, he's got some great freely available lectures on the subject online.
