So, space mines aren't primarily meant to knock out invaders. They are meant to funnel invaders into the safe zones where they can be shot by active systems. If your defense makes the bad guys go away without attacking, you win. If it makes them come at your strong points head-on, probably you win. I probably got most or all of this from David Weber's Honorverse books, so go read. 

Like others, I think [wave hands] gravity tech. will do. But you want details. Put the machinery inside a spherical, one-way radiator. There is no gravity inside, so the machinery isn't crushed by its own weight. (It is inaccessible. This star contains no user-serviceable parts.) Also provide antigrav. bracing inside the radiator so it isn't crushed by the effective weight of the fuel above. (Maybe it is two-way: tractor outside, pressor inside. Maybe they know tricky ways to make gravitons spin, or something, so the two effects nearly balance and the net energy input is small for a star.) The machine uses monstrous amounts of energy which just happen to be the amount of thermal radiation heading inward, so it stays cool. I suppose the radiator was sized to make this happen. No, I don't know how they achieve 100% conversion. Sizing. Orbital period determines the altitude. Temperature of the photosphere determines the spectrum, which they will want to specify. I think temperature also determines the output per unit surface which, together with the desired level of insolation and the altitude, should tell you the necessary size of the photosphere. I have no idea what the math looks like for any of this. Is it practical? What is the strength of tidal forces from an object with that surface gravity at that distance? How often do they have to drop another gigaton of H2 on it to keep it fueled? (How big is its fuel supply anyway? Where do they get it?) What are the safety margins you need in order to avoid roasting the planet due to a control hiccup? How much gamma and particle radiation does it deliver to the planet's surface? 

Source Based on the image, I can deduce that strong lasers are concentrated into the target chamber, generating enough power to "rip spacetime". This results to the energy being dissipated as a stream of radiation and virtual particles transferring their momenta into the ship. That stream is magnetically directed towards the back part of the ship to create thrust. 

For the locomotor skills you required, I'd say the human body plan is enough, albeit with slightly longer arms and three-jointed legs for quadrupedal motion, a prehensile tail for high-speed maneuvers, an opposable toe for each foot, and a highly flexible membrane connecting the forearms, hips, and forelegs for gliding and rolling. The creature would like a cross between a monkey, a flying squirrel, and a cat. Momo from Avatar:TLA would be the closest creature, minus the oversized ears. 

Apart from that, magmatter can also collapse into a blackhole if magatoms are oriented too close together, making strings, sheets, and hollow objects of magmatter the most practical structures. 

Perhaps something quite different, like sort-of an X.400 address with different labels: nun=incudibus,dpca=acme,dap=com 

That's not the nature of heroes. A hero doesn't want to rule; he wants things to be right. That things which should be done, are done, and things which should not be done, are not. He makes it so. He doesn't think he is special. Talk with any real-life hero and you'll always hear it: "I only did what anybody would do." The hero would like to just be ordinary and competent, and live in peace, never even thinking about whether there is a king somewhere, but things keep coming up and he has to deal with them because, well, that's what you do when things come up. As for the ruler who wants to use a hero to conquer the world, he runs a grave risk: the hero may ponder his orders and decide that his king has become evil, and thus sadly the hero must now destroy him. 

Simply put, this creature is engineered to be an interstellar steed, with enough reason to use insane amounts of power to sustain equally insane metabolic pathways. 

And here's a size comparison between a magmatter nanotube (the tiny blue line on the lower left) and a classical carbon nanotube. 

Organized Synesthesia is the biological version of multimedia arts. Within the brain, synesthesia occurs as an interpretation of sensory data from a sense organ that is somehow associated with a type of sensory data from a different sense organ. The idea of hearing smells and tasting emotions probably leads to disorganized thoughts, but enhances the synesthete's pattern recognition abilities. But by making the recognizable patterns available for correlation to consequently develop entirely new "meta-senses" arising from those correlations, maybe we can re-organize thoughts even better. The simplest example I could give would be a sensory ability made for sentient photosynthetic organisms, designed to find the optimal light settings to have enjoyable meals with maximum nutritional value. Simply put, a creature can taste the rainbow and the sunlight by having: 

I picture only few (one?) connection between adjacent countries, because then only one system has to be defended in case of an invasion. 

Here, star systems are connected with "wormholes". The wormholes facilitate travel at $250\ c$, regardless of mass. They are made using special ships. Any travel (including military vessels) not through the wormholes is well below light-speed (not more than $0.05\ c$, ). It takes a road builder ship $50$ years to make each endpoint and $30$ years to make a light-year of "road". So, for example, to connect two systems $10$ light-years apart, a road builder ship takes $400$ years. A road cannot be constructed by more than 1 ship, not even by building from opposite ends. All of a road has to be built by one ship. Additionally, roads cannot intersect in the middle. Here are some more information on the setting: 

With these in mind, together with the assumption that the magnetic charge of a monopole is directly propotional to its mass, then theoretically, magnetic equivalents of nucleons and electrons (called magnuclei and magtrons respectively) can stably exist as magatoms. Magatoms, having large charges, will typically have larger masses and also greater internal attraction-repulsion forces, therefore making them extremely dense, but also extremely strong materials. A magatom may be imagined as a big north pole orbited by small south poles. 

The four topics I discussed are more tightly related than I may have discussed them, but the simple premise is that language, thought, and perception will merge into a single concept. If the answer is yes and a convention for mixed sensations will indeed provide people with the privilege to broadcast the entirety of themselves, what would become of such a society? But if no, and allowing ourselves to consciously develop mixed sensations and be able to communicate them more efficiently still cannot allow us to completely and truly understand one another, then what can?
