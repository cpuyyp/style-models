The statistics in the OP about 350,000 Muslim prisoners and about the number added each year originate from a 2001 article by Siraj Islam Mufti titled "Islam in American Prisons". It is cited in the journal article Muslims in Prison: A Case Study from Ohio State Prisons 2004. Mufti has a PhD in philosophy from University of Arizona. He became a chaplain for federal prisons in 1995. His article, states: 

The statement in the OP attributed to the nakedscientists.com really originates from the 15 February 1997 issue of New Scientist: 

This and later similar road construction through cemeteries is referred to as "violations of the sanctity of the grave" by the board. 

The second OP quote is from a 4 May 1863 article reporting the approval of the flag. A couple weeks later, a 20 May 1863 Savanna Daily Morning News article The Flag stated: 

See this book for a more complete history of the word "racist". No, it was not coined by Trotsky 1927, it was coined by M. Gaston Mery by 1895. See also the 1923 use: 

This reference, beyond confirming that oxygen still remains after boiling, gives an idea of the timescale for the approach of equilibrium. The faster you heat and use the water, the more oxygen will remain, but no matter how long you heat the water (in the presence of air) there will still be significant dissolved oxygen. 

For more information, see Meggyesy's 1970 book Out of Their League starting at the bottom of page 245, where he explains that coach Charley Winner (who had been held as a prisoner of war by the Nazis) lectured the team on exactly how to stand at attention during the national anthem. Then he writes: 

The funds for the above organizations do not go to weapons. Synagogues, churches, temples and mosques can donate to 501(c)(3) organizations, so it is possible to indirectly donate to the above organizations through a synagogue. 

According to Italian Society Reflected in New Vatican Accord, Toledo Blade, 14 October 1984, page 2 of section C: 

Daughters of the American Revolution Magazine, Volume 54 says that between February 1919 and February 1920:

Historically, yes, flour has be recommended by the medical/scientific community as a burn treatment. In the 1829 CASES OF BURNS TREATED BY THE APPLICATION OF FLOUR Monthly Journal of Foreign Medicine, Volume 3, page 467-468 (reproducing an article from the London Medical and Physical Journal): 

Still, 1,700 millionaires is only about 0.1% millionaires. The USA has about 4% millionaires for comparison according to this article Credit Suisse says that Gaza has in the range of $5,000 to $25,000 of wealth per adult. 

Overall, the truth is the 14,000 1980s California wind turbines have been decommissioned. In the late 1980s there was a problem of dysfunctional wind turbines just standing there, at the worst 3,000 simultaneously. But by 2012 there were only about 500 in such condition. 

So, according to General Hertling, while it must be confirmed by a general, admiral or the secretary of defense that it is really the president giving the order, "The president always has the authority to order an attack". For more information see Nuclear Command and Control in NATO: Nuclear Weapons Operations and the Strategy of Flexible Response. I'll only quote a portion: 

Other high wind events at the same location are: 180 mph (1942) 178 mph (1980) 174 mph (1979) 172 mph (1985) 

Managing Expectations: U.K. Industrial Production gives many more countries and 3 different equalization points: 1991=100: 2006=100: 

Comparing the story to statistical expectations for normal distributions of independent variables: 68.2 % are within one standard deviation. 0.682^5 = 0.148 (101 / 680) 0.682^6 = 0.101 (69 / 680) 0.682^7 = 0.069 (47 / 680) So even after 7 round, one would expect 47 cadets to be remaining, and even more given sizes of various clothing items are correlated. The story doesn't seem credible. On the other hand, there is a study involving 680 cadets discussed in the 1955 article "Physique and success in military flying" American Journal of Physical Anthropology, vol. 13, pages 217-52. The story could have originated from actual measured data, but morphed over time. Particularly, it seems to be a dramatization of The "Average Man"? (1952) by Gilbert S. Daniels. 

In other words, while the FDA stated that it intends to pursue a change in policy, the change has not yet occurred or even been officially proposed. The FDA page with the above statement still links to Blood Donations from Men Who Have Sex with Other Men Questions and Answers which clearly states:

Other relevant examples are: From Proceedings of the 41st Convention of Southern Agricultural Workers: 

Then, as explained in the 12 October 2015 article Pentagon airdrops ammunition to groups fighting the Islamic State 

So the assumption is that cattle are grazing upon land that would be forested without human intervention. The most obvious problem with this analysis is that there are much fewer than 45 trees per 55 square feet. One acre is 43560 square feet. According to Tufts University Office of Sustainability: 

An early English-language example of the supposed quote, as published in Muslimnews International, May 1967, is: 

However, (as already mentioned in the OP) there is a February 1915 statement in Railway and Locomotive Engineering, vol. 28, page 40: 

Concerning the United States, the publication Reading and Mathematics Score Trends gives data for 1973-2012. See especially figure 2. 

According to retired Lt. General Mark Hertling, who personally participated in such drills, and wrote Nuclear Codes: The President's Awesome Power 

It is a pretend radio commercial. Even though the company did exist 75 years ago the acronym "GEICO" was not in use at that time. Instead, the name "Government Employees Insurance Company" was used without an acronym. See for example the 1949 ads in The Postal Record, Volume 62. Also, you can see from these ads that back then you would be writing the company, not calling the company. The company only filed to register the trademark "GEICO" in 1962, and stated it was in use since 1948, so it was definitely not in use in 1940. Particularly, the record of US trademark registration number 0763274 for the trademark "GEICO" for insurance, says: 

According to Man/boy love and the American gay movement Journal of Homosexuality (a peer-reviewed journal) volume 20, issues1-2, pages 251-274 (1991): Firstly, it is stated that author David Thorstad was the president of "New York's Gay Activists Alliance" and "a founding member of the North American Man/Boy Love Association (NAMBLA) and of New York's Coalition for Lesbian and Gay Rights (CLGR)". 

All credit to Brad J. Gemmell, Passive energy recapture in jellyfish contributes to propulsive advantage over other metazoans Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the USA volume 110 pages 17904–17909. As reported in Eel migration to the Sargasso: remarkably high swimming efficiency and low energy costs, the eel is very efficient. Particularly, its efficiency is calculated to be 0.5 kilojoules/kilometer/kg. Let's compare this to a human bicycling. I'll use a 50 kg human, 29 kph (18 mph), 599 kilocalories per hour. 599 kilocalories/hr is 2500 kilojoules/hr. This corresponds to 86 kilojoules/kilometer. Or 1.7 kilojoules/kilometer/kg Eel is more efficient by a factor of 3. (From the jellyfish article it can also been seen that a species of jellyfish has about the same efficiency of the eel. Large marine animals such as whales do not seem to have been considered.) See also Swimming speed, respiration rate, and estimated cost of transport in adult killer whales, which shows that at an optimal speed of around 3 meters/second, killer whales have an efficiency of 0.78 kilojoules/kilometer/kg. Better than a human on a bicycle, but not quite as good as an eel. According to Energy in Nature and Society: General Energetics of Complex Systems by Vaclav Smil, at page 103 

As far as the first poster in the OP, an Italian History Society link indicates in was provided by the Center of Military History. A thesis gives a different source: 

In other words, removing pubic hair correlated with increased risk of sexually transmitted infections, especially sexually transmitted infections of the skin. 

upon which they brought him a prisoner from Czechoslovakia to fight. The Nazis used a combination of rewards and threat of death to force the prisoners to fight. Additionally, there is some dispute whether or not the boxer was in fact Jacques Razon rather than Arouch. See footnote 33 of page 251 in Greece--a Jewish History 

Firstly, the 4% perfect use failure rate is merely someone's guess, particularly James Trussell as author of "Contraceptive failure in the United States", Contraception vol. 70, pages 89-96: 

The quote in the OP from the creation article is an accurate summary of a mainstream Science Daily article: Big Bang's Afterglow Fails Intergalactic 'Shadow' Test: 

A 01 July 1918 The Washington Herald article If It's Hamburger Say Liberty Steak also attributes the origin to Peoria, Illinois restaurant patrons. See also the 11 June 1918 El Paso Herald. So the change to "Liberty Steak" was not due to the government. However, as explained in Have You Bought Liberty Cabbage Yet? New York Tribune 25 April 1918, purchase of sauerkraut had markedly declined and dealers asked the Federal Food Board for help, and the Board suggested changing the name to "liberty cabbage". This term caught on and numerous newspaper articles from this time period refer to "liberty cabbage". 

So a person is receiving about 2 services per visit. For example a pregnancy test and an abortion or a pregnancy test and a so-called "Emergency Contraception Kit". So, in summary, PPFA does not provide any medical services or abortions, but chooses to affiliate itself with 59 entities which provide various services and on a per service basis, meaning providing a condom or pregnancy test counting as 1 service, these 59 entities conducted 323,999 abortions out of 9,455,582 services (3.4%). About 13% of the patients seen in the year received an abortion, neglecting consideration of patients having more than one abortion in the year. 

Yes. According to Slipped on Banana Peel: Atlanta man is minus two fingers on one of his hands The Times and Democrat 21 September 1911: A man slipped on a train car step, and had his fingers run over by a wheel. The 07 November 1900 Evening Bulletin says Thomas Reed broke his leg 6 inches above the knee after slipping on a banana peel in front of Owens hardware store. The 21 May 1901 Butte Inter Mountain reports that Dan Cullen had both legs severed just above the ankle after slipping on a banana peel and being run over by a train he was trying to board. The 22 July 1902 Evening Bulletin reports that George Hamilton broke his right arm in two places after slipping on a banana peel. The 28 October 1909 Neshoba Democrat reports that W. W. Cockrell hurt his leg after slipping on a banana peel. The 18 October 1921 Evening Public Ledger reports that Michael Managan broke his skull after slipping on a banana peel and may die.
