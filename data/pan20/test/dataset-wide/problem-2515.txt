Recently i stumbled upon a movie disc and on it was a movie called "American guinea pigs". It wasn't a typical funny horror story, it was a ultra realistic documentary style movie. There was a woman laying on a table (tied to it) and she was surrounded by masked group who injected something into her. Then her skin was removed from her neck and her calves were cut of in pieces. I was shocked and i felt my heart pumping and i was about to faint. i stopped the movie and just waited for this rush to pass. But i couldn't close the movie until i knew it is a movie not a real life event (if you have seen it you will know why, it is very real). So i played it again and dragged it manually to the end. Then the carnage was followed by them chopping her arms and gutting her. I couldn't take anymore so i skipped to the end. Just like all the movies this had a clip from the sequel too. It was a new born baby and a little boy on the table this time, i was too traumatized to remember but the text below meant that this would be the sequel. This was hard for me and my mind burst into a sea of emotions and it kept reminding me the equally disturbing real life events i unfortunately witnessed in my life. I had no other idea but to write them all down on a book.Now whenever i feel i'm loosing my edge with my still very young practice i read that book and somehow it immediately bring me back to mindfulness. 

So what about the Past? Past is not a real thing.Your brain can't even fully memorize a single event.What it does for this amazing magic to happen is very simple. It is more like how you studied back in the school. Your brain/mind remember the most important events of a memory and fill in the blanks to make the rest of the memory.But you can't find a difference between the memory and the real event.Because what your mind makes up is all you can remember. For example try to remember the last time you went to see your grandmother. Can you remember what shoes you were wearing? Can you remember who you met before going there that day? I guess you will not be able to.Brain did not recorded those things in the permanent memory.Because none of those small things were important to make the memory in the first place. 

Well after i recovered from couple of life threatening health situations i felt the same way like you do now. I was also not interested in common person's goals and i did not saw any importance in those stuff either. I was finally able to come over those things and these are my ways of getting over this situation. I hope this helps... 

Walking on water.... Walking on water is a piece of cake compared to what Buddhist monks and Lord Buddha has done. 

In a Dhyana Dhyana means the peace you achieve through meditation.In this state of mind you are free from the chaos of the world and the mind. But this is temporary,when you loose Dhyana you will face chaos again. In the state of an arahant An arahant is a person who has gone beyond greed,lust,anger,They have achieved Nirvana. Their peace is permanent. 

Here is the thing about attachment... New Buddhists learn how bad attachment is and they immediately thing\k all attachments are bad. Any ironically no one care to ask "Are all the attachments bad?". 

Part 01 :- Sam saw Jenny and he fell for her the second he saw her. (Sam's eyes saw light which was recognized by his brain+mind as a woman. His mind remembers that Sam is straight so it immediately start to examine Jenny's body. There is an understanding in Sam's mind about his taste and it sees Jenny is a perfect fit. As Sam hast lust+attachments for such a body,mind starts a stream of thoughts signaling that there is a hot girl nearby.) Part 02 :- They date for sometime and go to a serious relationship. (Sam and Jenny both find their attachments in real life and decide to hold onto it.) Part 03 :- Sam and Jenny are married now and its been 9 years. (They both did not wanted to loose what they found because of the strong attachment they built in their own minds. The attachment and fear of loosing+fear of not finding a substitute kept them together for nine years.) 

Yes you should start a simple meditation.Buddhist meditation doesn't require you sitting down like yoga to it on your way to office,in the bath tub where ever you want.You don't even need to close your eyes. Please refer this link to learn more.. $URL$ 

The attitude You are the best example for this, look back and see how your attitude changed over the years. From home to school, From school to college and from there to work? Even you can't memorize it all now can you? People change and that is something i don't have to explain. So what's the solution? It is OK to have relationships and my friend do not be afraid of having to attach yourself to someone because none of us are free from anything (Only an enlightened or an arahant is free from attachments,everyone else either attach or collide with everything they find) If you are even considering someone to date you are allready attached, that is the truth. Buddhism do not go against people having relationships. Just remember People change how they look,walk & talk,literally everything changes and you will have to take it all like a man and lie with the understanding who you love and what that person is a forever changing thing and you will have to accept the fact that what you once saw in that person will most likely disappear in time. Live with the understanding of things,You will allays have an attachment to him or her but if you are with the understanding that it is only a person who change and you are just like that too and if you understand the fact that one of you might have to say goodbye to the other (Even if you love each other that does not mean death waits for anyone) you will live a happy life and i assure you it will not be a major issue for anything. May triple gems bless you! 

There are many good returns of Meththa to a practitioner.If you look at "Meththanisansa sutta" Lord Buddha had spoken of all of those in one teaching.Here's the english translation of Meththanisansa sutta 

So the real question is what a person needs. It's either the continuance of the Human Race or being free from personal Suffering. Before anything else let's look at what Lord Buddha said about Humans. Lord Buddha said that there is only one Human realm. But Lord Buddha never said that there is only one Human world. People often misunderstand Earth for the world realm. According to Buddhism there are numerous planets like earth which includes Humans in them. Some experts suggest that Lord Buddha means Parallel worlds, but that is not up to us to decide. So even if a disaster kills all of us here it would not be the end of the human race. Is sex forbidden? The simple answer is NO. But if someone wants to take and advanced step while living a Lay person's life he or she can refrain from SEX. So it is a personal choice not a necessity or mandatory. But we as Buddhists consider sex as a low and worldly joy, As what we seek is a much better one. 

Yes Meditation can help you sleep... There is a meditation called "Meththa" also known as the "Loving kindness Meditation". This Meditation is very helpful to the daily life as well as the path. It can help you sleep better, But Let me provide the details.... The profits of doing "Meththa" (Loving kindness Meditation) as to Lord Buddha 

Now Lets talk about the ambitions part, Let me tell you a story I learned it from a monk. this will give you a direct answer..... 

So what i'm asking is... Are they labeled Lower realm creatures because they are Bad or Evil from birth or is there any other reason? (Please note that i am only asking about the Race/Species/Beings called Yakkha or Yaksha) 

I can give you many examples and they all end with a perfectly logical meaning.So the truth is chanting does not bring magic. Learn suttas with meanings - Click and learn Try learning about the meaning of suttas then you will see that they are not magic.And it is the right way to use suttas, because reciting with meaning can bring you to better understanding and it gains you very good and powerful karma. 

Meththanisansa sutta I heard this way..... Once when Lord Buddha was residing in Jethavana Monastery of noble anepidu Lord Buddha started a conversation saying fortune ate monks, The monks replied saying "yes,Fortunate one".Lord Buddha then went on to teach this. Fortunate monks, one should expect 11 returns from a "Meththa Samadhi" which has been Frequently practiced Practiced like a vehicle/ship That has been a basic goal of the mind Which has been started well And which has been established well in the mind. What are these 11 returns? 

Other than in Hollywood movies we have not heard of peace having two sides. In Buddhist reality there is no outside and inside. There is only the processes of the mind. Simply put it, MIND IS THE INSIDE AND OUTSIDE. To have peace one must have peace within, Once you have it there is no reason to worry about an Outer peace. Here is a link to a book, It is free and you can read it online or save it to your device.Take your time and Read this. $URL$ 

Although you must know a rarely occurring incident which goes a bit different. If a person reach Nirvana while being a Lay person and choose not to be a monk that person will choose "Parinibbhana" within 7 days. This has been stated as "Nature" of such an event. 

These three phases or sides of your mind feeds the craving you have for life,to be born again,to live forever,to chase the mirage of happiness. This is bad because it's these three phases that drives a being further into "Samsara". These 3 has brought you here and they will drag you through the dangerous lower realms to feed on innocent little animals,to be be hunted by lions and tigers,to be eaten alive and even to be tortured and burned in "hellish" realm. This is the true danger that a being face in Samsara. Because once there in a bad realm there is virtually no hope for a poor being. And what about the good realms..... Yes, those 3 sides of your mind also took you to "Deva" realm,to "Brahma" realm and here to "Human" realm. Not so bad you might say,won't you? Well lets see. you have been born so many times in this samsara. Our Lord Buddha said "Any being has been killed so many times.If someone collect all the blood that fell when he or she was decapitated,the amount of blood will be roughly equal to the amount of water in the sea." Look at that old person next to you, after listening to the words of lord Buddha can you certify that he or she next to you has not being someone you loved? Well lets see this in another way. We know what animals are,they are the poor beings who lost their way and ended up in a bad realm. When you go home and eat a delicious meal like a fish curry or sausages,look at it closely. Imagine a one you had. Do you see your father or mother? How about that girl you promised to live eternity with in another life, don't you see her? The sad fact is you do. Now you are eating them so greedily,just like they ate you. Look at this bizarre circle that we roam around from good realms to bad, from bad to good. One day Lord Buddha smiled and there was Ven. Anandha thero nearby. As a smile from a Buddha is rare the venerable one asked why. Lord Buddha gave a strange reply, if you focus on this statement alone you can understand the true reason to practice "Mindfulness" and the true danger of Samsara. The answer was "Look Anandha, look at these ants here. There isn't a single ant in this long row of ants that hasn't been the king of earth". 

What is the object of faith/shraddha? The object of Shraddha are - Triple gems Buddha (Lord Buddha) Dharma (Lord Buddha's teachings) Sanga (Monks) 

My friend i must suggest that you should see a good teacher. Maybe something can be wrong with your posture, it can lead to many discomforts. Pick a position that is good for your Body Weight. May the triple gems bless your efforts! 

In my country (Sri Lanka) government is about to bring out a new set of laws to govern Buddhist councils. This kind of a law has never existed in my country and being a Buddhist country there is some speculation about why only one religion is effected by this new law. There are some fears from monks about government trying to shut up the religion & it's power over people even though some are ready to examine the whole thing and come up with modifications. There is a line about putting the "Monk imposers" in jail. And some fear this might be a bate to take down Buddhist organizations and Monks who speak against injustice. Public literally has no clue about what to say or do, Most likely people will oppose it and there is a big potential that this might lead to some serious outbreak of violence and religious conflict. 

As you already know mind is capable of generating Karma just like the body. When a body does something it is not Body's thought, it is just the execution of thoughts that turns into actions. Same theory applies to the words. As thoughts are followed by the actions feelings are followed By thoughts. Thoughts are the execution of mind's activities. Just like actions & words are the executions of mind's activities. As Lord Buddha taught there are three types of thoughts... 1:-Thoughts that create "Attachment" 2:-Thoughts that create "Collision" 3:-Thoughts that are "Neutral" Above 1 & 2 create Karma but the 3rd does not because it is neutral and therefore unable to create attachments,collisions or deceiving thoughts. So if any thought that can be taken into the categories 1 & 2 obviously create Karma.
