When mistakes happen in the workplace, you need to look at the mistake from 3 angles, and you'll need to consider the ramifications for each one. The Business Level There was a problem, and it's going to impact the company somehow. Maybe it's losing time, a client, or reputation, but you definitely were the cause, and it's definitely going to give your supervisor a headache. In situations where there's professional impact, you may get directions from management such as working extra hours, or skipping break to ensure things catch-up. Managers or co-workers won't care about snickers, they just want things running smoothly. Even if they don't ask, staying late to make sure things get caught up is a bit of an unspoken agreement. The Professional Level You've impacted your co-workers on a professional level. Usually lost work or a similar setback. The important thing here is that it doesn't impact anybodies personal lives, just their professional ones; the impact will only be felt until quitting time. If this is a first-time issue, especially if you're new, apologies are good in order, but overall it should slide. If a co-worker is really thorny over your first mistake, that's their issue. If you've caused issues before, or in rapid succession, you should consider compensating them on a professional level; offer to take some workload off, buy coffee if they missed their brake, and generally try to ensure their day goes smoothly while they iron out your issue. You might be offering to work late (without explicitly saying it). In either case, make sure they know you'll take any heat from higher-ups (if they don't already know) while passing information up the food chain. The biggest thing at this level is to learn from your mistakes. The Personal Level. Your mistake cost someone on a personal level; The most common you'll likely encounter is someone needing to work late because of your mistake. As soon as you cut into somebodies off-hours, the minimum you should do is offer to stay until they're finished if you are able to assist. If it's only a few extra minutes, even hanging around while doing on your own work is a good gesture just so they know they aren't alone. Don't ask, just stay unless they specifically ask you to leave. If you're making people stay late enough to conceivably miss dinner - pay for take out; even if it's a team of 7 hungry developers. Also offer yourself up to do coffee runs or errands while they recover for you. In the event a co-worker is somehow going to get stuck for transportation (e.g. their carpool isn't staying behind) you should drive them if able, or at least offer to pay for a taxi. Mistakes aren't pay-to-fix Overall, a mistake should have an appropriate response; buying candy because you made an error isn't going to fix the issue. Sometimes a simple "Sorry I corrupted your build" is correct, other times you may shell out $80 for pizza because 5 people need to work late. Higher-ups won't care about gifts, they just want you to push and make sure the problem is resolved and eveyone gets caught up. 

Don't write your absence on your resume, your resume is meant to highlight your assets; any absence is best left for an interview question. It would also kill your resume since the writing explanations will read on paper like excuses - you're handing them your positive traits, not a doctors note. DO put your past careers on your resume. As per explaining the absence during an interview, be frank and direct. State that you had issue X, be truthful about it, and let them know that the position you've applied for is something you're confident you can contribute to. 

While counter-intuitive holding back information keeps it digestible, and when you do get questions later you'll find they'll closely follow the bullet points. Just because you put a bullet-point on a presentation saying you'll cover X doesn't mean it has to be scripted. This actually manipulates the questions into the presentation; if you know questions are coming - make it the questions you want. Then you'll be prepared and in control during the demonstration. The Demonstration People expect demonstrations to take longer, and whether you want them or not questions WILL eventually come: so what you want to do is cover the main points in the demonstration very quickly so by the time people begin butting in with their inquiries you've already hit the marks you've aimed for. Keep this step under 3 minutes, and treat it like the introduction. This isn't the time for detail yet. This is just showing your introduction again, but live. If you can, have the areas of your demonstration ready in advance. Don't explain, just show, and keep any description down to sound-bytes. If you can, write a 'micro-narrative' which people will mentally follow, such as the path a user might take though a system: "This is the online store, simple, clean. The shopping cart, and here's the checkout page." Don't rush this part though; even though you're moving quickly, you still need to keep it digestible. The main risk here is having someone in the room ask "can you go back?", which will kill all momentum and kick you into the main questions phase prematurely. If you have particularly impatient audience members who ask questions, take the question but try to use it as a lead-in for the next part of the demo. If I were showing a shopping cart and my next stop was the checkout here's how I'd manage the following; 

I can't say I know the best thing to do, but I'd love to hear that you went back to them and said: "I have to confess, when you asked how much I made before, I exaggerated the amount. I'm sorry about that, but to be honest I was afraid that if I told you the real amount, you'd make me an offer that was too low. I've heard that happens, and I really feel I'm worth X." "I wouldn't be surprised if you're no longer interested in me, but if by some chance you are, I was actually making Y. But I'm afraid I'm not comfortable showing you my salary sheet." "Again, I apologize for not being completely honest before." 

A friend of mine sent me a job posting. I read the description, did some checking, and discovered that two months ago I had applied on Indeed.com to a job at the same company, that used the exact same job description. This could be the same job, unfilled until now; or it could be a second opening for the same position. Perhaps they suspended the search to fill the job, and started over. In any case, they have my resume. This time, however, my friend knows the recruiter and has given me her contact info. He recommends that I send my resume to her, mention that he referred me, and say how much I'd like the job. But if there's a chance that she somehow remembers my previous application, won't this seem pushy? I didn't get a call back, after all. UPDATE: I took your advice and sent my resume to the recruiter. Now I have a phone interview scheduled with the company. Clearly I was too timid, and having a referral helped. Thanks, all. 

A better question would be "In addition to sending my resume by e-mail, should I ALSO send it by mail or courier (and in the cover letter, make it clear that I also applied electronically")? I don't know if that's necessarily the best approach, but it has all the advantages that the other posters say about e-mailing resumes; plus you get a bit more attention. The only disadvantage is you might still look like a kook. 

Is your resume posted on a job board such as Monster? If so, I don't think the recruiter is keeping you in their database. I get a lot of calls from recruiters, including those I've sent my resume to in the past. They often say that they found my resume on a job board, not in their own database. (I can confirm that, based on the e-mail addresses I use in different resumes.) I'm fairly certain that this company really does remove you from its list, but a few months later their agents simply rediscover you, along with many other candidates. I suggest that your resume (at least, the one you put on the job boards) have only a Google Voice phone number. Not only don't you have to answer it, but the voicemails can be sent to you as e-mail, so you don't have to play them back. 

I'm applying for a job, and among the questions in the boss's e-mail is: "How many of [your previous] employers would provide positive references for you?" Most times, hiring managers ask for references knowing we'll leave out the unfavorable ones, but this time he's implicitly asking about those. What should I say? The honest answer would be "All but one". But I'd hate to be the only applicant who's being honest. Should I briefly explain about the unfavorable one, even though he didn't ask me to? 

One piece of advice I hear a lot is that, at the end of a job interview, you should actually ask for the job. It shows your enthusiasm, it helps the interviewer remember you later, and so on. But, as one who's kind of an introvert, I can't think of a good way to actually say it. Do you say "May I please have this job?" Or "Could you please hire me?" They both sound kind of needy. Or am I taking "ask" too literally? Should one say "I'd really like to work here." Or "I'd really appreciate it if you chose me." Also, do ask at the end when I'm shaking hands with the interviewer? Or earlier when he says "Do you have any questions?"? (It's not really the type of question he's asking for.) UPDATE: The interview went well. I took the advice about expressing enthusiasm instead of literally asking for the job. Wish me luck.
