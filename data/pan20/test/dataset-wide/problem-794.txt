You need to have huge tangential velocity to escape the sun attraction! The closer you are, the higher the velocity must be for celestial body to avoid falling on the sun. 

There is however an exception I've been thinking of. Since glass has an amorphous structure, it can also be regarded as a liquid... And if some advanced form of life or intelligence managed to send some into the interstellar medium, then yes there is. It's also possible that some stellar explosion send away magma of some form with an amorphous structure similar to that of glass (e.g. obsidian) 

This diagram was created with gnuplot., Public Domain, Link So it looks to me that in some time, when its wavelength falls at around 12cm), some of its energy should be transferred to water molecules the way it is in a microwave oven. 

This question is a followup of Is there any theoretical or empirical research about planetary systems with a black hole in their center?; Since it is possible to detect planets around stars with the change of light they cause, I would think it should also be possible to detect them when they orbit around an active Stellar Mass BH. From what I (can) understand from the first answer, there is no known case of planets orbiting around Stellar Mass BH. What could be preventing us to observe it? 

I'm interested in the Alfonsine tables published in Paris in the 1400s. I know there is an English translation of what survived of earlier Alfonsine tables from Castile, but that's not what I'm interested in. If you know of software that implements the algorithms implied by the table, that would be good too. 

The USNO page refers to USNO Circular 163 which in turn refers to a paper by Aoki et al. and one by Moyer. These papers explain how the expressions created by Simon Newcomb at the end of the 19th century were updated to work with the new system of constants introduced in 1984. If you want to change the epoch, you could redo these calculations with the epoch of your choice. Further changes to celestial mechanics calculations have occurred since then, but apparently the USNO has decided that for the accuracy stated in the USNO web page, 0.1 second, it is not necessary to overhaul the calculation to account for all the changes since 1984. 

Since I learned about Newton's gravity law, I wonder if I can measure the moon's gravity using (almost) no special equipment. The best I could come up with is a pendulum, which is in a resting position. The moon (at the horizon) will pull on the weight at the bottom of the pendulum and cause it to shift. 6 hours later, with the moon above or below the pendulum, the weight should be back. Maybe we could detect the shift, just like we see the tides. 

Running the math for a 5 meter long pendulum and 1 kg mass, I get an amplitude of 0,017 mm. I fear that external forces (wind, unstable surface, ...) will be bigger than this effect. So my question is: is it possible (again, without specific equipment) to measure or detect the moon's gravitational force? What would be the best way to measure/detect it? 

White dwarfs start hotter when they are created (up to billions degrees Kelvin), but in the end, they end as black dwarfs, which only happens after a few billion years. As per the age of the universe, it is currently the assumption that there are no black dwarfs yet. Red giants are (on the surface) typically below 5000 K. Their core is up to a billion degrees Kelvin. This might be an interesting link too. As a final note: white dwarfs are the end stage of a star's life. Depending on the mass of the star, red giants can end up as white dwarfs. About 97% of the milky way stars will end as white dwarfs (including our sun). 

Not Nuclear fusion; There is also a huge amount of nuclear fusion that creates heavy elements from all the iron there is in neutron star: they in fact are not only made of neutrons. But as said in comment, building of heavier elements rather consumes energy than it generates some. Not sure scientists has a clear agreement on how this works. Gravitational collapse For example I found this (rather old) abstract which states it could be a result of gravitational collapse, without singularity (since here the result of the merger might not be a black-hole, or the lightest ever: around 2.7 solar masses!) 

Since Andromeda is the closest galaxy, it is inside "our" galaxy cluster, and stays bound to ours by gravity. 

A day back then was shorter than today's earth day. The earth was rotating quicker in the past, but its rotating period around the sun didn't change much because of Kepler's law. I cannot say how it was 5 billion years ago (anyway, did the earth had something you could call a surface to track the day from then?), but you could find data derived from fossils analysis for the last billion years, e.g. here from Nasa's SpaceMath, on how long a day was back then - I realize now the figures below assume the orbiting period of the earth around the sun (~8766 hours) stayed constant over this period of time. This assumption is wrong as explained here - however stating it "has been close to its current value for the last 2-3 billion years", so below figures are an approximation 

0 RA is the direction from the center of the Earth to the vernal equinox. You've already imagined the plane in space created by projecting the equator into space. Now consider the plane formed by the mean orbit of the Earth; this is the ecliptic. The two planes intersect in a line. The ray from the center of the Earth toward where the Sun is in March is the vernal equinox; the ray from the center of the Earth toward where the Sun is in September is the autumnal equinox. The big difference is that the location of the vernal equinox among the stars changes very slowly, taking about 26,000 years to sweep all around the ecliptic. The plane that passes through the north and south pole and the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, sweeps through all the stars every day. 

In a time, the word "standard" normally means the civil time, recognized by the government in the place of interest. I'm not sure about other countries, but in general conversation in the USA, "standard" also means that daylight saving time is not in effect. "Daylight" time (as in "Eastern Daylight Time") means the civil time, recognized by the government, and daylight saving time is in effect. These can be expressed in the ISO 8601 format; the standard gives the example "15:27:46+01:00" meaning the time zone is one hour ahead of (east of) Greenwich. In astronomy, time can also be the local time of the observer, ignoring the existence of time zones. This is local mean time, and is obtained from Universal Time by adjusting for the longitude of the observer. Usually the exact form of Universal Time that would be used would be UT1. Local apparent solar time is based on the actual position of the sun; it is the time given by a sundial. It can be about 15 minutes ahead of or behind local mean time. 

from Sky & Telescope Clusters where the denser places of the universe, and due to this highest matter density, is where first stars where created. 

Thermonuclear event again: fission From Space.com, they say Kilonova energy could be explained by rapid atomic decay of heavy elements 

Basically, No. for liquid as we commonly know them on earth. If you trow a water bucket in space, it gets quickly vaporized. From this interesting ref: 

Another effect I'll try to illustrate with Wikipedia images: the sun trajectory's elevation in the sky would change year after year (cycle: between 8 and 9 earthlings years), due to moon's apsidal precession and its tilted orbit plan: By Rfassbind - Own work., Public Domain, Link By Geologician, Homunculus 2 - from English Wikipedia, CC BY 3.0, Link 

I invite you to get a better idea of what we can see of the distribution of stars from our planet here, where you can zoom in and out and get an understanding of scales. 

If I want to write a date in the Gregorian calendar, I can write it in the ISO 8601 format; today would be 2016-02-20. The advantage is that there are many parsers available to let computers read in this kind of date. But what if I want to write a Julian calendar date, as astronomers often do? Is there a similar widely-accepted format, and selection of parsers, to use with the Julian calendar. While I'm at it, what if it's an ancient date where we don't know how many solar days ago it was; instead it is an astronomical phenomenon calculated in Terrestrial Time (more or less atomic time) or by dating decay of radioactive elements? Is there a standard way of writing such a date? 

I have read that "earth rotation angle" is the modern replacement for "Greenwich sidereal time". Is it actually the case that modern professional astronomers are using earth rotation angle? Either way, what is the reason for using the one they use? 

An observer on the far side of the moon would have hard time to explain it stands on a single planet, because of the movement of the most noticeable thing in the sky: the sun! Indeed, because of the eccentricity of the moon's orbit around earth, the day length, i.e. the sun's "speed in the sky", depends on where you stand in your lunar orbit. And from observations it can do, e.g. other planets that are nearly perfectly round in the solar system (and for well known reasons), she should be forced to rule out the "I'm standing on an elliptical single celestial body" hypothesis. I cannot calculate the variation of day length on the far side of the moon in a reasonable amount of time, sorry about that. 

From what I can understand, Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation (CMBR) is microwave now, but was initially visible light emitted long time ago. 

You can use an application that shows the stars at any time and location. Stellarium is free, has nice features and isn't too complicated. You can select a star/constellation and flip through the time of day and through the days to see how its elevation changes over time. In general, everyone with the same latitude sees the same sky at a certain date (assuming an equal elevation, which counts if you're standing on Mt. Fuji). So those dates for New Sealand are irrelevant for you. Using the StarmapPro application, I made the following chart for your location (Tokyo) showing the elevation of Centaur at midnight for each month. 

This is known as Olbers' paradox. An (in my opinion) better explanation can be found here. Note that these links answer the question why the universe (not the milky way alone) isn't blazing our night sky. Now if the universe (including the milky way) can't do it, the milky way can't do it on its own... There are just not enough stars giving enough light. Brightness is reduced quadratically by distance. That counts up very quickly with astronomical distances. Even for stars that are our neighbors. 

As you say, expansion is proportional to distance. And in fact, compared to the size of the (observable) Universe, Andromeda and our Milky Way are close together. Indeed, farthest objects are now more than 20 billion Ly from us, whereas Andromeda is only 2.5 million Ly away. That is a 1/10000 factor. The space expansion between them is not enough to set them apart, because of their general motion. On small scale (until galaxy cluster scale), the motion is primarily ruled by gravity. Galaxy cluster are in fact the largest gravitationally bound systems we know. 

I'm asking this question in the tentative to compare the Big Bang to a gamma-ray burst. I keep in mind that a key difference between both is that Big Bang was Not an explosion, but want to know similarities to point out. Near the formation of a black-hole they tell in this same article that matter and magnetic field play a key role the gamma-ray bursts. I know magnetic fields are induced by charge displacement. Is it possible there was a kind magnetic field before protons and electrons formed, or during the first expansion phase? Here are pictures I modified from Wikipedia's chronology of the universe to illustrate:
