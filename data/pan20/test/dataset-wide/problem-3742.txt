Something that seems to be pretty standard in every introductory treatment is that the infinite places correspond to embeddings into $\mathbb{C}$. Do the finite places correspond to embeddings as well? I can envision two possibilities. My first guess is that the primes sitting above $p \in \mathbb{Q}$ correspond to embeddings into $\overline{\mathbb{Q}_p}$, and thus also to embeddings into $\mathbb{C}$ by some messy non-canonical field isomorphism. My second guess, which I think would imply the first, is that the places of $\mathbb{Q}[\alpha]$ above $p \in \mathbb{Q}$ correspond to embeddings into $\mathbb{Q}_p[\alpha]$. I've never been able to find a precise statement about this in any of the texts I've been studying (mostly Milne's notes and Frohlich & Taylor) and would appreciate if anyone could let me know where to learn more about this -- or if I'm just plain wrong. One other thing is that the embeddings into $\mathbb{C}$ play a central role in analyzing the basic structure of a number field by way of Minkowski theory. Is there some analog for the finite places, or does that even make any sense? 

Yes, any indecomposable projective-injective $A$-module $P$ is (isomorphic to) a direct summand of every tilting $A$-module $T$. Just check that $T \oplus P$ is also a tilting module, and then use the fact that any two tilting $A$-modules have the same number of isomorphism classes of idecomposable summands. 

Yes $D$ must be finite-dimensional over $F$. This follows from a Theorem of Kaplansky's that I found in Herstein's monograph "Noncommutative Rings". The first step is to show that an algebraic algebra of bounded degree satisfies a polynomial identity (see Lemma 6.2.3 in Herstein), i.e., is a P.I. algebra. Note, however, that the degree of this polynomial identity may be larger than the degree of the algebra, as defined in the question. Then since a division algebra $D$ is primitive, one can use: 

The standard term for a ring satisfying (F) (for right modules) is a (right) Hermite ring. A good introductory treatment, including proofs of (2a) and (2b), is contained in Section I.4 of Lam's book "Serre's problem on projective modules." Springer Monographs in Mathematics, Springer-Verlag Berlin 2006. (I think this material is also in the earlier edition "Serre's conjecture" published in the Springer Lecture Notes Series, vol. 635.) Lam also notes that Kaplansky had already used the term "Hermite ring" for a less general class of rings, and so he calls those rings "K-Hermite" to differentiate. He also attributes the result (2b) to Serre. 

It sounds to me that you need to detect the tempo of the music, and not the pitch. If you are trying to use a pitch-detection algorithms, then these are going to fluctuate rapidly, as they will lock onto the high frequences in your music. It sounds like you need something that filters out all but the lowest frequencies and allows you to determine how many BPM (beat per minute) the music is, as well as the phase of the beat also, so that you can do beatmatching as you originally mention. However, I don't think that anyone here is going to be able to give you a simple formula for doing this directly from the samples. Digital signal processing is, by its very nature, a fairly mathematical subject. I do think that if you try Googling for "beat-matching signal-processing", or "beat-matching matlab", you will be pointed in the right direction, as you might find a published algorithm for doing exactly what you need. For instance, I found the following paper by searching: Design of an Automatic Beat-Matching Algorithm for Portable Media Devices. It might be worth looking at if you can get it without paying, say through a university with a subscription. Otherwise, I'm sure there are 100's of similar papers you can find on this subject. Also, many universities teach an audio signal processing class, and often the notes from these classes are online. Beat-matching is a common project for students to try in such classes and I'm sure you will be able to find some examples where people have done it. Sorry I couldn't give you more explicit advice, but I hope I understood your question correctly and have pointed you in the right direction. Good luck. 

When $R$ is a simple curve singularity, the category $MCM(R)$ has finite type and the structure of its Auslander algebra is known. (When $\mathcal{C}$ is a Krull-Schmidt category with only finitely many indecomposables up to isomorphism, one can form a basic representation generator $M$ as the direct sum of one copy of each indecomposable object. The Auslander algebra of $\mathcal{C}$ is then defined as the endomorphism ring of $M$.) A good reference for information about the Auslander algebras of simple curve singularities is Chapter 9 of Yoshino's book Cohen-Macaulay Modules over Cohen-Macaulay Rings. In particular, Yoshino computes the Auslander-Reiten quivers of $MCM(R)$ for the A-D-E singularities, which can also be viewed as the Ext-quiver (or bound quiver) of the associated Auslander algebra, call it $\Gamma$. Thus $\Gamma$ is a quotient of the (completed) path algebra of this quiver, and I believe the relations of $\Gamma$ can be chosen to be the "mesh relations" (i.e., there is one relation coming from each almost split sequence in $MCM(R)$. Unfortunately, I don't have a good reference for this fact, but it should not be too hard to verify by choosing nice irreducible maps corresponding to the arrows of the quiver and computing the relations they satisfy.) Now the endomorphism ring of a single indecomposable MCM $R$-module can be computed as a corner ring of $\Gamma$. For instance, I would start by identifying the minimal nonzero cycles at the vertex corresponding to the indecomposable module of interest. I haven't tried to do this myself for the $f=x^3+y^4$ example, so perhaps it is harder than it sounds. In fact, in this case it seems nontrivial to compute even the endomorphism ring of $R$ itself in this way. 

If you are interested in developing quantum algorithms, there is a nice up-to-date survey by Childs and van Dam called Quantum algorithms for algebraic problems, available at $URL$ For PDE's, you might look into hyperbolic polynomials and hyperbolicity cones. The latter are characterized algebraically, there are lots of open questions about them, and their study is also practially relevant to engineering applications like convex optimization (in case practical applications, or perhaps hot funding areas, are what you're looking for). 

What is $\mathbb{Q}_p \cap \overline{\mathbb{Q}}$ ? For instance, we know that $\mathbb{Q}_p$ contains the $p-1$st roots of unity, so we might say that $\mathbb{Q}(\zeta) \subset \mathbb{Q}_p \cap \overline{\mathbb{Q}}$, where $\zeta$ is a primitive $p-1$st root. As a more specific example, $x^2 - 6$ has 2 solutions in $\mathbb{Q}_5$, so we could also say that $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{6},\sqrt{-1})\subset \mathbb{Q}_p \cap \overline{\mathbb{Q}}$. Edit: I removed the motivation for this question (which I think stands by itself), as it will be better as a separate question once I think it through a bit better. 

Not in general, although there may be some classes of algebras where it holds. For a simple counterexample $A$ consider the path algebra (over an infinite field) of the quiver $$1 \stackrel{a, b}\Rightarrow 2 \stackrel{c}{\rightarrow} 3$$ modulo the relation $ca=0$. This algebra has global dimension 2, so in particular the subcategory of modules of finite projective dimension is all of $A$-mod, which is contravariantly finite. However, the simple module $S_1$ has no right-approximation by a module of projective dimension $\leq 1$, so $P_1$ is not contravariantly finite. Informally, one sees there is a one-parameter family of nonisomorphic indecomposables with dimension vector (1,1,0), each of which (with one exception) has projective dimension 1, and maps onto $S_1$. Then one can check that there is no single finite-dimensional module of projective dimension 1 through which all of these maps can factor. I believe that one can make this argument more rigorous (but I haven't checked the details) by using the fact that this algebra $A$ is stably equivalent (by constructing a node) to the algebra $\Lambda$ studied by Igusa, Smalo and Todorov in their paper "Finite projectivity and contravariant finiteness," Proc. Amer. Math. Soc. 109 (1990), no. 4, 937-941. 

What roots of unity can be contained in the abelian extensions of an imaginary quadratic number field $K = \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-d})$? In particular, I would like to know: 

You should seriously consider using Adobe Illustrator if you can get your hands on it. I'm all for latex + beamer for talks, but you might end up waste far too much time on the formatting if you try to use latex. If you do this, you'll need to copy in your equations (as pdf with outlined fonts) created with some tool like LaTeXit (for Mac) or otherwise some equivalent. On the plus side, the added cost of putting in math will help you focus on the graphical content. 

I believe the double cover you are looking for is just $\tilde{U}(n) = \tilde{U}(1) \times SU(n)$, where $$\tilde{U}(1) = \lbrace\exp(\phi T) : 0 \leq \phi < 4\pi\rbrace$$ is the double cover of $U(1)$ and $T$ is a formal generator of its Lie algebra. This cover factors through the usual cover $U(1)\times SU(n) \to U(n)$ as $$(\exp(\phi T),U) \mapsto (e^{i\phi/2},U) \mapsto e^{i\phi/2} U.$$ So the problem reduces to classifying the $\tilde{U}(1)$ representations and the $SU(n)$ ones, and the answer is straightforward. First decompose $$L^2(\mathbb{R}^n) \simeq \bigoplus_{N=0}^\infty V_N,$$ where $V_N$ is the eigenspace of $H$ with eigenvalue $2N+1$. Then $\tilde{U}(1)\times SU(n)$ should act irreducibly on each $V_N$ as $$(\exp(\phi T),U) \mapsto e^{iN\phi/2} \cdot \mathrm{Sym}^N U.$$ It is easy to see this. The $\tilde{U}(1)$ action is the same as with the usual $L^2(\mathbb{R})$ case. You can easily derive the $SU(n)$ representations using the Fock space isomorphism of $L^2(\mathbb{R}^n)$ with a Hilbert space of analytic functions: $$L^2(\mathbb{R}^n) \simeq L^2_\mathrm{hol}\(\mathbb{C}^n,\pi^{-n}e^{-||z||^2/2}dz).$$ Under this isomorphism, $V_N$ maps to the space of homogeneous polynomials of degree $N$, and $SU(n)$ acts on polynomials in the usual way as $(Uf)(z) = f(Uz)$. This is probably all contained in Bargmann's classic paper. 

The simplest counterexample I know is when A is the mesh algebra of generalized Dynkin type $C_3$ (see the paper "Periodic algebras" by Erdmann and Skowronski). Its quiver is the same as the preprojective algebra of Dynkin type $D_4$, but the relations are slightly different. It is symmetric and periodic of period $6$. If the central vertex is labeled 2, and the three other vertices are 0, 1, and 3, the indecomposable projective $e_2A$ has structure: $$\begin{array}{ccc} & 2 \\ 0 & 1 & 3 \\ 2 & \ 2 \\ 0 & 1 & 3 \\ & 2\end{array}$$ Thus $e_2Ae_2 \cong k[x,y]/(xy, x^2+y^2)$, which is not periodic. Your other observation at the end is interesting. While I don't expect that to hold in general, at the moment I don't know a counterexample. 

I believe this answers your question, although it may not be that enlightening. Basically, you can rephrase the existence of a faithful semisimple $R$-module in category-theoretic language as follows. First, an $R$-module $M$ is faithful iff $M$ is a cogenerator in $\mbox{Mod-}R$ for the subcategory of (finitely-generated) projective modules; i.e., for every nonzero map $f : P \rightarrow P'$ between projectives $P$ and $P'$ there exists a map $g : P' \rightarrow M$ such that $gf \neq 0$. Thus the ring $R$ is semiprimitive iff $\mbox{Mod-}R$ contains a semisimple object $M$ that is a cogenerator for the subcategory of projective objects. 

Yes. Let $K \subset \mathbb{C}$ be a number field that is closed under complex conjugation (not necessarily Galois). Modulo the roots of unity, the group of unitary units in $K$ is free of rank equal to the number of infinite primes of $K$ minus the number of infinite primes of the real subfield $K \cap \mathbb{R}$. Recall that the number of infinite primes of a field is the number of real embeddings + half the number of complex embeddings. This is proved nicely in this paper by Daileda. Note that $K$ and its real subfield have the same number of infinite places iff either $K$ is totally real or $K$ is CM (meaning a totally imaginary quadratic extension of a totally real field). So for precisely these cases, the only unitary units in $K$ are roots of unity. 

Actually, I think the channel is not extremal because I suspect you are misquoting the Landau-Streater result. So I will state it here. To be precise, for anyone unfamiliar with the field, a quantum channel is a trace-preserving, completely-positive linear map on density matrices (positive semidefinite matrices with unit trace), of potentially different sizes. A basic theorem in quantum information says that every quantum channel from $m\times m$-dimensional to $n\times n$-dimensional density matrices can be written in Kraus form: $$ \rho \mapsto \sum_{i=1}^N A_i \rho A_i^\dagger, \text{ for linear operators } A_k \colon \mathbb{C}^m \to \mathbb{C}^n \text{ satisfying } \sum_k A_k^\dagger A_k = I_m. $$ It is easy to show that the set of quantum channels between systems of fixed dimension is convex. It also easy to show that the set of channels that map $\frac{1}{m} I_m$ to a fixed density matrix $\sigma$ is convex. Now the theorem of Landau-Streater says that if $m = n$, a channel with Kraus form as above is extremal in this latter set if and only if the $N^2$ linear operators $A_i^\dagger A_j \oplus A_j A^\dagger_i$ (of size $2m \times 2m$) are linearly independent. It seems you have instead been working with $m\times m$ matrices. But I think that even if you were to continue and apply the theorem correctly, you would only prove or disprove extremality in the convex subset of unital channels, i.e. those for which $\frac 1m I$ is a fixed point. So potentially you could strengthen Ben-Or's conclusion by showing non-extremality in this subset, or otherwise you might conclude extremality there, which would tell you nothing about extremality in the entire set of channels. 

I believe I had this exact same question some time ago. Auslander and Reiten attribute this result to a paper of Auslander and Green. I still have the latter paper, but can no longer find where this result is in that paper. From my old notes, it looks like I concluded that this proposition is misstated in Auslander and Reiten's paper. Most likely, they may have meant to write "strong tilting module", rather than strong cotilting module. In your example of $A=kA_2$, the strong tilting module is $DA$, and this contains all simple $A$ modules (as submodules) on both sides. Alternatively, for strong cotilting modules, I believe the proper statement is the dual that every simple $\Gamma^{op}$-module is a quotient of $T_{\Gamma}$. If you want to see a proof of the statement for strong tilting modules, see Prop 7.1 in the paper $URL$ 

The theorem would still apply in the characteristic $p$ case, but as suggested in the question, it would not follow that the center of $D$ is finite-dimensional over $F$. Edit: Kaplansky's paper can be found here: $URL$ 

Just a thought, but maybe you should have a look at sage. It's a big open source project that is currently under very active development. If you're interested in contributing, I would suggest that you post to the sage-devel Google group with this same question. Some thoughts for things to do would be to improve the support for relative extensions of number fields and for function fields. 

"Geometry and the complexity of matrix multiplication", by J. Landsberg from the AMS bulletin is a very nice article. It describes an approach to this problem based on algebraic geometry, that of bounding the "border rank" of the sequence of bilinear maps defining matrix multiplication. I don't think it reproduces the state of the art yet (but I'm not an expert so maybe), but it is a well-defined mathematical program that should in principle be able to uncover the optimal exponent. I think at least the basics of the approach should be pretty understandable with a minimum of background, but the whole theory does go pretty deep and technical. I believe this is, however, the nature of the beast - it is a shockingly deep question.
