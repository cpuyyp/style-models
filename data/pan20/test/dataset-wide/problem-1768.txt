I have a pretty easy problem I'm trying to resolve here. I'm constantly running the (host) command on domains, to get their IPs, then (host) again on those IPs to get their PTRs, then I'm SSHing to that server represented in the PTR: 

It sounds like you are trying to setup custom name servers so you can give any web-hosting client of yours pretty name servers with your domain in them (NS1/NS2.MyCoolCompany.com), as opposed to showing that you are actually reselling hosting when you tell them to point to (NS1/NS2.MyUnCoolHostingCompany.com). Setting up custom name servers with GoDaddy would simply be a process of logging into your account and then getting to the control panel for the domain name that you want to use as your custom name servers, be sure you click on the domain name to get into the more detailed info for it and don't go to the domain's dashboard. Then just click on [Host Summary (Add)] at the bottom-left of the page. Add [NS1] as the host name and then enter an IP for it, then (Add) again and do the same thing for [NS2]. It's Ok if you have them both point to the same IP address if you were only given one by your web-host. Doing the above steps affectively registers your domain as a name server although you might have to wait up to 12 hours before you can point to it. Then it's just a matter of popping into WHM or another control panel software and setting your server's name servers to also reflect the (NS1/2.YourCoolCompany.com) host name, or you can add it manually as well. 

Now your computer can also directly query one of the authoritative name servers, to get back an authoritative response: 

Silly no nonsense solution I've had to use before on some servers when rsync alone doesn't want to place nice. Use tar to only grab files you want: 

To simplify your question, there are a couple things to keep in mind. DNS = Domain Name System Name Servers = Stores DNS records to resolve domains On your local computer, you have a DNS resolver that connects you to the global DNS network. Most recently and commonly, you can use Google's public DNS servers at: 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4 When your computer needs to resolve a hostname like google.com, it will first send a generic request to your locally set DNS resolver. That would look like this in a Windows command prompt: 

You get a Non-authoriatative answer back, because the name server we just queried doesn't maintain the records for Google, it simply has them cached for us. You can use the set q=NS command after starting nslookup to query a domain name's authorative name servers: 

I am trying to configure asterisk PBX behind my FreeBSD router. To allow other sip clients to call I need to forward ports to my local network asterisk machine. I did it for 5060 and 5061 ports using ipnat and configuring ipnat.rules 

I have freeBSD router and it host public IP address, I am using ipnat.rules to configure port forwarding prom public network inside my private network. Now I wondering can I restrict only specific public IP addresses to can pass trough my port forwarding. What I want is to only my specific public IP addresses can walk inside my network on specific ports. Here is how now look like my ipnat.rules file 

Is there any better solution than ping -t for monitor status of some VPN clients. I have set up FreeBSD router with fix public IP address for accepting incoming PPTP VPN connections. The callers are some simple routers with ADSL connections and dynamic IP address. When VPN caller get connection it got local IP adders which I can ping from my windows work station and also from FreeBSD router, IP addresses are always same for specif caller ID. Now I want to monitor what happening with callers, Are they connected, to get notification when some host is unreachable and to have log when they are connected and when they had gode, for how long they are connected and things like that. So i can debug my VPN callers and see why some one of callers losing they connections and for how long they are not attented to I can ping them. 

Gmail from Google also have great integration with other POP3 servers, but also got many benefits like, addons for mozila or IE so it can work faster a great amount of space and also mobile version and others 

I apologize for reopening this and answering 3 years after. I have almost same issue on pf ver 2.3.2-RELEASE-p1 After hours of googling I fund this. $URL$ Sometime gateways do not want to response to ping. If your gateway working but dashboard still shows that is offline you can try to change advanced settings on gateway for Data Payload.(Define data payload to send on ICMP packets to gateway monitor IP.) 

But I do not know how I can redirect UDP port range from 60000 to 610000 and also port range UDP Port 10000 - 20000 

How many current users can accept FreBSD, I am using it for about 30 current users, whit no any problems. Maybe pfSenes distro can offer You faster way to implement OpenVPN or PPTP VPN 

The problem that I'm having is when I call ssh via xargs, I do get SSH'd into the remote server but with the error [tcgetattr: Invalid argument]. I'm sitting at the remote server's shell but when I try to run any command it just hangs and eventually I have to Ctrl-C to break out of it. If I don't tack on the (ssh -tt) then I get a [Pseudo-terminal will not be allocated because stdin is not a terminal] error. This seems like such a simply problem so I'm hoping someone more familiar with ssh via xargs can let me know if it's even possible. 

Now if Google was to update their DNS records on their ns1.google.com name server, it could take between 1-8 hours typically for those records to propagate over to other caching name servers. So to answer your question, your local DNS server knows how to resolve your domain name, because when you registered your domain name you had to point the name server records to a valid DNS server, making that DNS server (name server) the authoritative server for your domain's DNS queries. All other name servers on the net, such as Google's 8.8.8.8 will cache your server's response as people search for your domain name. A good example is that your local ISP could be caching DNS queries. For instance if your next door neighbor just got the authoritative DNS records returned for your domain, and then you looked them up right after, more than likely you'll get a cached response from your ISP's name servers rather than the request having to possibly break out of the network just to receive back the same results a minute later. If no one in asks for your domain name over a 24 hour period, it could be possible for the DNS records to decay and fall out of cache based on their TTL (Time to Live) setting. If this was the case, when someone went to query your domain again, the first thing that would happen would be a whois lookup on your domain seeing what the authoritative name servers are for the domain, and then you'd be getting an IP address resolved back from your local DNS server that you've setup to handle those requests. Name servers and DNS are a pretty complex topic, if you need any further explanations let me know, as I've written extensively about them: $URL$ 

Simple enough right? It's just tedious doing this over and over, so as with everything Linux I want to speed it up by automating it: 

My question is; how can I create a scheduled task via command line, with the trigger “At task creation/modification". 

I have downloaded a media from msdn of windows server 2012 to upgrade a server core to gui, but this media does not have de winsxs folder in the source folder there is just a SXS folder. I have tried to install the feature with this folder as a, path but is not working. My question is what is the difference between the winsxs and the sxs folder and why is this folder missing from the installation media. 

I am requesting a certificate that must be approved by the CA administrator. When I make the request, it appears in the CA pending request folder and I right click to issue the certificate. but the approved certificates don’t appear in the personal folder of the requesting computer. I have tried refreshing the certificates mmc and updating the machine group policies but the certificate does not appear in the client computer. My question what I need to do after issuing a certificate in order make it appear in the certificate vault of the computer. 

I am trying to create a script in powershell that request and install an available application for a user or computer in the sccm application catalog. I know that there is a way to force sccm client actions using wmi methods. Example 

I have been using robocopy with the switch MT and really makes a difference in coping time. I would like to know why the CPU treads act as a bottle-neck while copying files or what makes robocopy with multi-treading copy faster. 

I am in a command prompt of winPE and would like to start from there, the installation of windows 8. I have the files of the installation media on the local drive but I dont know what is the file that I need to execute in order to start the windows installation wizard. Whats the file that start all the installation of windows in winPE. 

I need to request a certificate via command line I have investigated that certreq is the tool that can request the certificate. I am used to the gui to request the certificate by selecting one of the available templates, but I need to do the same via command line. Any ideas about how to achieve this? 

I am creating a schedules task to run just before it's created and deleted after it runs. I am using the tool, schtasks to create the scheduled task, but i havent found the parameter to run the task "At task creation/modification"
