Very unlikely that only skin cells can be modified to have chloroplast, in plants, all cells have chloroplasts. The effect would be minimal except probably make people green colored if chlorophyll is made or nothing is it is not. Photosynthesis probably won't occur unless you make it happen by modifying other parts of the cells. AFAIK the only animals to have chlorophyll adaptations only use it as a pigment and do not photosynthesize for energy. The amount of energy that an animal can get from photosynthesis is probably too negligible to give any advantage. 

Use Drugs Instead Instead of messing with their brains by trying to mess with brain waves, this can easily be done with drugs. Depends on how you want to deal with administering the drugs but even discretely spaying it in the air as they walk by can be enough to completely override their emotional state if the correct drug is used. There is a reason why drugs are used much more readily deal with psychological conditions over electro-therapy. There are drugs that make you high, ones that makes you depressed, ones that completely destroy your sense of reality and ones that knock you out. It is why so many drugs are controlled substances in most countries. And part of the reason why some drugs are so addictive. Drugs also do not allow mind reading so your concern of that can be eliminated. 

Some exoplanet are though to have oceans hundreds to thousands of kilometers deep without any land. It is conceivable that all the dissolved salt will sink to the bottom of these oceans due to the density of salt water vs fresh water. Also when there is this much water, there is a good chance the salinity is so low, it would be undetectable even if the salt does not sink. 

In League of Legends there's a champion called Rek'sai. She's a voidborn (an alien from a different realm) and can 'swin' in the ground. She makes the ground vibrate enough to move freely through solid terrain but she also creates portals to travel faster. She's more like a cricket mole but she moves like a shark in the ground. She's a feared monster in Shurima's desert who can eat expeditions like nothing: $URL$ 

They're practical and almost everybody can buy one, compared to curved swords, thrusting a monster would be way more destructive than slashing them. EDIT: or use pikes/spears if range is a problem. 

How can these beings start a religious revolution to take down their enemies and stop their supremacy? 

Actually robots will never replace humans in a lot of jobs: nurses, teachers, and other social based jobs will always require human contact or that 'touch'. maybe a mix of terminator-paranoia and humans being social animals so they can't just stay in their houses doing nothing, they need to make social groups. 

So a magical mutation can be differentiated from a normal mutation if the parents of the child are magic users. 

All swords are good against unarmored enemies. Totally depends of the numbers and how durable are they, but against an unarmored opponent my best choice would be a rapier. They're light, fast, you can deal fatal wounds against unarmored enemies and have enough range to take down enemies due of thrusting. Almost one handed so the person can carry a shield or a small axe. 

We're talking about a late-middle age civilization. Actually magic is a thing in this world (pretty powerful magic). This magic works almost as low reality manipulation using your life force (most of the times). Since some people have amazing magical affinity but low prana runes are almost always used and sometimes life force can be damaged if you don't take care of it. People have different talents (as the 7 types of intelligence) so a person who's bad in alchemy probably can be an excellent healer. These are the magic types of my world: 

Natural nuclear reactors are a thing. If might be possible that there are large deposit of radioactive material deep in the Earth that gives sustained power output. It is however thought that there isn't enough radioactive material in the upper crust of the Earth any more to sustain any natural reactors today. 

I'd say the utopia becomes broken after a few weeks. Utopias for humans are inherently unstable systems because any small disturbance out of perfection sends it from being the utopia you imagined. Your city might not be burning after a few weeks but there would already be social constructs that makes the whole system somewhat uneven. There would be groups that form with social ladders (even small groups of friends usually have some hierarchy of social power), people would be gossiping to gain social status. Small things would be left out or exaggerate for personal gains. All of which destroys the whole concepts of the utopian society. The corruption would start small as people start from an even playing field but as social structures form, people are going to gain power over others. Larger forms of corruption within systems are going to come out because any greedy system will gain positive feedback. This means any imperfect human nature will manifest itself and then spread within the whole community if it can gain something. People who abuse this will generally become better off just from the fact that if others don't know and there are no laws against it, anything they can use to gain power will be used. To combat the runaway effects of the greedy system that is human nature in our own society we have laws for the greater good of everyone. However laws introduce bureaucracy and imperfect systems of laws eventually becomes corrupted anyways as those with power within the law can abuse it for their own gains. Due to the imperfect nature of humans, laws become complex to fix all the loopholes and in the end you don't get what people consider an utopia. However even if you had enough rules and they are perfect, your utopia general looks more like a dystopia than anything else. The creation of a lot of rules to cover all the cases that people can abuse just restricts individual freedom to the point of eventually making everyone like a robot. If your system is adaptive with governments like ours and some very basic levels of social support and motivations then it can be stable for a long time even if there are cases of corruption. However if there is fundamental problems with your initial government and it does not adapt the the sentiments of the people, then it becomes a problem very quickly. There are government systems in countries with power struggles and no governments or even system of government last more than a couple years. As long as the public perceives that the current system is better than any easy alternatives then you can keep the system going. Either by artificially making other systems hard gain support by actively destroying rebellious people/idea or by making your system decent enough that most people aren't active looking for alternatives. 

So your animal would be almost a living balloon rather than a sentient lifeform, something like an air jellyfish. It can probably develope toxins or defensive traits to help it survive, but it would be too easy to catch. 

How can a medieval civilization create an educational system that allows the monarchy to use these mages in the battlefield? Something I missed. Almost all are young (12-18 years old, when prana starts to activate) 

As part of the new deities plan, they must bring down the elder gods in their world to create enough chaos to 'starve' them. The religious focus is simple: 

Some people born with higher prana pools and regeneration, and there are a few special persons in the world that have a potential unlimited prana growth, almost predestinated to overcome gods (that's why they're hunted as demons). But the main topic is not about their powers, but how can I create some common diseases caused by prana problems, like low flow in a limb, or even parasytes, how can I make this life energy affect the biological aspects of human physiology? One of my ideas is a prana rupture, when an attack hits in a way it cuts the flow and the body starts to lose energy towards the enviroment, but people with higher prana flow would suffer its effects in a higher way. 

Janna, a champion from League of Legends, was a human but eventually the magical pollution made her look like an elf 

As part of my magic system, the 'life force' is mostly a common 'supernatural' energy produced by most lifeforms (and some minerals can stock/deflect it). This energy allows humans and other human-like beings to control/create magic/summons and increase their stats to superhuman levels, however not all people can withstand the energy consumption of enhancement due of their low 'life energy' levels, causing a multi organ dysfunction syndrome and potential death since they can't regenerate the amount of energy faster enough to continue their normal metabolic processes. This life force mostly flows in the blood like oxygen. 

They are hermaphrodites that reproduce by direct contact with each other. In their reproduction cycle, if 2 organisms touch, they inject each other with genetic material and then both will die off in the process of creating offspring. 

They can do it in seconds. "The group would know exactly how to find and assemble any items involved in the process of creating the machine." If their brain is programmed with what ever knowledge they need for making anything. Just make 1 of the 20 people the computer. The only real thing required will be a language to interact with the "computer" so that any one of the 19 other people using it can figure out what is happening, and since they already know everything they need to do, they can just do it. The "computer" can encode any information it wants into sound and the 19 people can decode the sound in their head into windows 1.0 UI. A person should be able to process any high level UI level command within a reasonable time with training, and since these people know everything they need, they should be able to do it. If above is not valid because they didn't create the machine. Then it would take 9 months for 2 of them to biologically create a new machine and then a couple years of training to get the machine programmed correctly. 

Weather on Earth is generated by the thermal energy the earth gets from the sun. If the Earth was smaller but has the same gravity and atmosphere, one difference would be the surface area that can receive sun light. Another would be the temperature delta between the equator and the poles that acts as an engine and is what primarily drives the global weather systems. Having the distance be smaller between the source and reservoir can dramatically change the systems that forms. The real problem however with trying to figure out weather is that weather systems are chaotic in nature. Which means these systems can change drastically based on even minute differences in initial conditions. Even small changes can cause weather systems that are not stable in any way. Even if the Earth was 1% larger/smaller, the difference could be raging storms and runaway greenhouse to a cold dead world with little weather simply because solutions to these chaotic systems are extremely unpredictable.
