In between, various other scenarios - regular pulses being improbable, though not impossible - e.g. still happen if the "cloud" is instead a "galactic stream of cosmic dust - after repulsing a "wave" by a gamma burst, the stream renews the density of the cloud with other incoming matter. 

capability to use the control/use the energy to work the fields - do you realize how much infrastructure you need to create and get to run agricultural machinery? Conjure into existence steel/metallurgy, petrol, roads/transport, etc. to get "modern farming". If you get those, there's little difference from the "modern world" (cca late 1800) fertilizers - Haber-Bosch process is probably the other factor that is needed for the modern agriculture. 

You can probably selectively breed them for your definition of intelligence. 1000 years however isn't really long enough to get good results because of how long each generation takes for an elephant. We have been breeding dogs for tens of thousands of years and there is definitely some selective pressure there from humans to get more intelligent dogs. People would want dogs that are social to humans and are easy to train. Dogs will probably score better than wolves at human intelligence tests because they been bred to have all the human characteristic enhanced. The problem however, with breeding elephants with selective breeding is how long it takes to breed them. A dog has a life cycle of ~15 years and can reproduce at age 5, which means a generation of dogs to the next is ~5 years. For elephants, females are fertile around 10 while males take about 15 years. So each generation takes more than 2x as long. In 1000 years, you can only do about <100 generation of elephants and that is just too few to selectively bring out traits you want. Keep in mind even with tens of thousands of years of selective pressure for smarter dogs, they are still nowhere near what most people would consider human intelligence. You might be able to breed "smarter" elephants in that time but it is unlikely they'd show the difference you are after. 

Those 2 alone would allow to feed the entire population with only 7-10% of it working in agriculture. Of course, knowledge on selective breeding and whatnot are going to help, but given the two above you can skip highly productive breeds/varieties in the first phase . Hydroponics? Last time I checked, nobody is growing staple (corn/wheat/rice, potatoes, sugar cane/beet, oil crops) in hydroponics condition - it's simply too expensive even today. 

Another invention - "muscular skin", fibrils normally contracted and desiccated when dormant - which is their "use state". The fibrils relax upon feeding with a special nutrient (feed can only be administrated within a narrowish temperature range/env conditions) and when relaxed the scale can be easily extracted - but is not loose enough to fall on it's own. The skin also require feeding periodically (every 2-3 days?), otherwise the wear cause by the relative movement/friction will cause the skin to tear. Bonus - make the scales a by-product of the skin metabolism, something like hair/nails (keratin or chitin stuff). Advanced scenario - make it a living thing in symbiosis with the wearer and feeding from the wearer's blood stream. The skin is grown specially for the host, cannot change the her/him on the danger of anaphylactic shock for both the host and the skin within minutes. If you can give the skin some nervous system enough for perception, instincts and reaction (toughen when detects fear, amplify the strength of fast movements, etc), such a skin would try to protect the wearer as the only source of food. 

Bacterial DNA repair would probably not work very well in humans. From what I am reading, Deinococcus Radioduran keeps 2 copies of DNA and have mechanisms to repair any damages within hours but it has a much smaller genome compared to a human and it's repairs are still susceptible to failure like during normal cell operations. What I imagine happening would be cancer cells developing from his cells being extremely resistant to chemotherapy. Can you imagine self repairing cancer cells that is resistant to chemo? The stem cells might be nice to have tho but I don't know if it will help this guy with much. At the end of the day, I don't see this person functioning very well as a human. I think it would be very hard for this person to do anything or go anywhere, not only would it be hard to move in his large shell but it would be hard for him to use any vehicles. It might even cost a lot of money to keep him alive because of this disability. Not being able to breathe well and having such an unusual body would require specialized medical attention, I imagine he would need a very highly oxygenated room as well as a specialize bed. As for food. I guess the hospital might need to make sure he gets more protein than the average person as DNA repairs going on the background might need more protein. Maybe he would need more other nutriments to supplement his shell as well. I'm not sure what kind of exercise plan they can give him because moving can cause server internal bruising and using too much energy with the limited oxygen he can access to can cause serious problems. I guess keeping him completely still might be best for him. In this case it would probably mean limiting his calorie intake as well. 

There are scenarios where it can work without changing the history: transport aluminium spoons and crowns, get back the DNA of Michelangelo and Nero - insert a passage of Newton being nagged by a microrobotic mosquito probe; or just fingerprints of past celebrities for collectors. Speaking of DNA samples of the past: how about female/gynoid agents seducing and collecting genuine reproductive genetic material for those willing to pay enough to have a child of a male celebrity of the history? (maybe it can work for ova as well?) Any ethical conflicts for a story here? On the line of just the empty vanity of the customers, the children are missing the "nurture" side to realize the potential of the "nature"? 

This one is tricky and probably not doable but if you were at the exact right place at the right time, your brain might be able to conduct lightning and kill you in the process. 

A really good backpack that is well cushioned is the best idea if you don't want magic or tech that is way beyond what they had in the renaissance. 

Bronze was very expensive which is what probably limit the length of swords made with it. Otherwise, it's properties are pretty much inline with the larger iron swords that came later. The other thing is that metal armor was also not too common in the bronze age because of the cost so that you don't need a massive sword to do damage. If you needed longer reach, a spear would do. So there is less need of more massive swords. Massive swords aren't actually good against agile opponents in light armor. 

There was an answer, now deleted, regarding the energy resulted from the annihilation of a proton with a anti-proton and the comparison with the energy resulted from fusion. Too bad it was deleted, because there are conditions in which the answer was valid. In the event of matter/anti-matter annihilation, the energy is likely to be emitted in any direction. And it's many orders of magnitude higher than the chemical bond energy. Which means a gamma emitted towards the planet is very likely to vaporize some anti-matter and eject it in space towards the cloud of matter above. Would this anti-matter be electrically charged (very likely at the level of energy we are speaking), the magnetic fields will deviate the ejected antimatter in areas where the cloud wasn't repulsed by the "initial" explosion. With enough density of normal matter in the cloud, you may assist to a cascade effect causing a gamma storm engulfing the entire surface of the planet. Which bring us to the important parameters which describe what happens on the anti-matter planet - the (absolute) density and the distribution thereof for the matter cloud. 

Rope is the easiest thing to use. Trip the alien, tie the alien up and then it can't do anything. Then you can slowly break the tough skin and peel it off and torture the alien slowly to death. Everyone who surviving in the neighborhood can come out and do some the torture, it will be a fun experience for the whole family. Each time one is captured and killed the whole neighborhood can have a party. I'm sure everyone will enjoy killing the alien party, especially the ones who lost loved ones to the alien before everyone figured out how to fight them. 

See also: Herbig-Haro objects - protostars for which the accretion disk falling into the forming stars ionizes and the created magnetic field ejects polar jets at "supersonic" speeds. Those jets collide with the surrounding nebula and produces EM emission in visible spectrum (recombination and bow shocks) without the corresponding (for a mature star) IR part of the spectrum. How's the above relevant? Well, astrophysical magnetohydrodynamics is complex enough to allow a pulsating phenomenon (caused by the described configuration) to actually occur in the right conditions. It is also conveniently complex enough to allow for quite a fair bit of plausible hand-waving; feel free to do it I don't think someone will jump to say: "No, that's impossible", especially after accepting the presence of an anti-matter planet. To asses the safety of handwaving, a google search for "pulsating bow shock" brings in something like: 

With a black hole that small and that close, you'd easily be able to see it as an gamma ray source. According to your sheet, the thing is outputting 20 Pentawatts of hawking radiation. Which is more 4000x more power than the total power the earth gets from from the sun. 

Some exoplanet are though to have oceans hundreds to thousands of kilometers deep without any land. It is conceivable that all the dissolved salt will sink to the bottom of these oceans due to the density of salt water vs fresh water. Also when there is this much water, there is a good chance the salinity is so low, it would be undetectable even if the salt does not sink.
