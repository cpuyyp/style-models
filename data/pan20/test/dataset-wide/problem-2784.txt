You mention 'set-theoretic pluralism', so you already know that standard classical logic, with the standard interpretation via model theory already is such a logic. Those things that are true in all models of your axioms are true, those things that are true in no model are false. If you can create both a consistent model that contains an assertion and one that does not, then it is, by definition, neither true nor false, meeting neither criterion. This already establishes all the things you ask about, including the semantics, which are determined by that definition of true and false. It also kind of prescribes how the logic 'works' -- one must mark out and set aside independent hypotheses as potential seed axioms and not use facts within the same proof or construction that require contradictory axiom collections. So I miss the point of the question. I assumed you expected some kind of finite or transfinite proof-procedure for such a logic, but your responses indicate otherwise. Perhaps it is hidden in the motivation. In this approach to modern set theory, one need not be constrained to anything as weak as intuitionism or constructivism in deductions or in the 'meta-language'. You can escape it in many ways, but two are obvious. First, this definition of truth is based upon the construction of internally consistent example universes, and not on deduction. So things like the law of the excluded middle can be taken as axiomatic, and included as part of the definition of consistent. You need only 1) believe that isomorphic models really act the same and 2) give up the notion that there is a single over-arching meta-model of the entire universe which is internally consistent. Second, you can stretch the notion of construction to some degree. The most basic models, L and V, include ordinals within the models. This gives you transfinite induction and, therefore, transfinite proof theory, which allows for 'constructive' proofs about a wider range of things. Given that convention, you can presume a tower of 'large cardinal axioms' reaching up to Woodin's 'Ulitmate L' which increase the power of infinite proofs by using the idea that one of the 'union steps' in any transfinite deduction will happen over a witness to the presumed axiom. Also, I am not claiming the logic of model theory is free of confusion, only that it does, in fact, exist. One bizarre aspect of the semantics here that you call out by labeling the two layers is that the model construction happens in one set theory while the models themselves represent instances of another. For instance, "the axiom of determinacy of infinite games" contradicts the axiom of choice. Studying the axiom of determinacy, we can create a space of models of it. Then in all those models the axiom of choice is necessarily false. But we create them embedded in a world where we assume the axiom of choice is true, and the semantics of models' existence allow for it. The semantics say, then, that the embedded proofs require it to be false, but our knowledge of those proofs is contingent upon it being potentially true. We do so because the universe where it is false has less freedom, so we are entertaining a superset of the models that would matter if it happened to be false. If the extra one's aren't real, no loss of credibility ensues. But what if we did the opposite? We would have truths about the axiom of choice knowable only subject to its falsehood. The semantics admit such a thing, but whether it has any real meaning is highly questionable. So far, we have amazingly found that our identified independent axioms clearly have a 'bigger' and a 'smaller' side, or they form 'towers' of freedom, like the tower of large cardinal axioms, or the tower that has "finitism, determinacy, projective determinacy, hierarchical determinacy, hierarchical choice, ramified choice, choice" and clearly goes from smaller to larger worlds. They somehow do not have confluence points where it becomes ambigous which version of the world would 'admit more models'. But surely that is simply the human lack of imagination at work? It seems unreasonably convenient. 

These are not really exclusive terms that either do or do not apply to a given word. 'Water' is a singular substance in chemistry, but a general noun in ordinary life. Singular vs general is useful only to clarify which of the meanings you intend in given logical context, not to classify vocabulary. (Almost every noun is both: There can be a Springfield in every state.) As with other nouns, most ideological labels are both at once, often depending upon your distance from them. Christianity can be seen as a singular thing, from the POV of an atheist opponent, or a member of an exclusive sect that claims to be the one true faith. But from the POV of and ordinary moderate Christian, Christianity has multiple acceptable forms, making it a general noun. Feminism and Marxism, in particular, are so often singular nouns for their opponents, and general nouns for their adherents that proponents purposely say 'feminisms' or 'Marxisms' to capture the latter perspective. You are best off, in my personal opinion, always seeing them as general nouns so that you are not tricked into perceiving them as coherent targets. At both extremes, both atheists and rigid sectarians often ascribe to Christianity generally aspects that are true only of individual sects. This undercuts their understanding and leads them into misleading arguments. 

I think the earlier answers have overshot the mark. But that is to be expected, as I see it, because the framing here is wrong in a way that automatically rejects answers. People often argue ethical points from the law, ignoring that potential effects of breaking the law are just part of the equation of life. This question has the same flavor. All ethics is always about what to do in response to non-written rules. Response to what to do in response to written rules is 'political theory'. We, in the West, have lived so long with a standard of reference in a given book, charter, code or set of mottoes that we easily forget this. Social contract theory is not a replacement for ethics. Our decisions ought not to be made on the basis of a collection of written and unwritten rules -- or we are abandoning ethics itself completely. (A Kantian maxim is not a rule in this sense. It is not a social convention, and it has only its own power, not others') So your real question here seems to be How does one most ethically communicate about genuine ethics in real life? I would suggest that, ethics not being political theory, the idea of rules is not the right place to start at all. Taking the framing of 'unwritten rules' is presuming that there is a rule and that you know it better than the other person. If the rule is 'unwritten', this is not true in any objective sense. Rules also involve rewards and punishments. So the very idea of a rule implicitly makes a bribe and a threat to this person: you may punish them for their ignorance and reward them for improvement. Besides often being pointless, threats and bribes are always ethically questionable. The idea that you can genuinely make statements about your future behavior is always in some sense a lie. I would suggest that the most Kantian way of looking at an ethical problem that is playing out in real life is to do what Kantians do with all moral questions: Try to find a solution you could always follow that does not discount anyone's autonomy. The first move here is into either empathy or respect. Autonomy is about will, and we have only a very weak view into others' will. If we want to think about their autonomy, ll we can do is to try and create a model of their will, which we generally call empathy, or create an abstract model of human will that gives them as much freedom as possible, which we generally call respect (perhaps more properly 'deference'). If you actually find a suggestion that is fair and either empathic or respectful, it seems wasteful not to share it. So the second move is to communicate the thought. Is the right person to communicate with about this necessarily the person with whom you disagree? Often, but sometimes not. Ideas are shared very broadly in many different ways. (The more 'mystical' among us feel they are shared simply by existing, you communicate them automatically in ways over which you have no control. I will skip discussing that, but I can't help mentioning it.) The right person to speak to might indeed be the person you see has having been treated unfairly, it might be others around that person, it might be authorities, it might be everyone. (Talking to the child about the broken promise may help a lot more than talking to the adult who is disappointing them. At some point we all need to learn how to know when people mean what they say, and that even if they mean it, sometimes they fail. And if, say, this is an ongoing family dysfunction, it might be the siblings or parent of the adult making the promises.) For Kant, this is a contingent duty. You are really only responsible for your own behavior, and improving your overall situation is something that you do when you can. For Kant, most contingent duties should be submitted to local custom. So this is an intricate set of social skills determined by your social contract, but it has ethical contents as well. No useful social contract about communication is going to permit lack of integrity. Manipulating others for your own benefit is not the same as trying to help. There may actually be a place for both of these, but you have to know what you are about. 

More general notes in reaction to the comments: (Sorry to be a little bit ranting.) The relativism of the current era is not a consequence of the loss of a single standard rooted in an essentialist base. That shallow reading of the problem of meaning appeals to a process that was already doing fine on its own. Our failure to really converge on decisive shared structures is a result of a fearful, despondent modern pattern that remains essentialist to its very core, and pays lip service to the impropriety of essentialism only when it chooses not to be challenged so that it can take individualism as an essential value. Since individual choice independent of immersive context is exactly the wrong thing to value, in a post-modern view, since it is pretty much a complete illusion, This is not post-modernism. People just use post-modernist language, without its content, as a mask for its own insecurity.
