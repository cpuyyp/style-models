Not necessarily, though it is possible. As you say, most people are specialised. But given how just how specialised many people are, this begs the question how we make our current technology. For example, look at supercomputers (or even normal computers). Look at vehicle production. These processes aren't done with just one person operating everything, nor with one discipline of people. Computer manufacture involves people who understand processor architecture, OS designers, materials specialists, screen makers, precision robotics, and of course, engineers to make sure all the machines work. Car manufacture is similar: although it is mainly robotised today, the robots need maintenance, and someone has to design the car in the first place. None of these people can do all the jobs in the factory. So, the point is, for complicated jobs you get a group of people together and they do the job by working with each other. In the future, we may well have far more complex technology. I think that as this happens, the teams we will need to work the processes and machines will grow, and the fields they each study will narrow. So, in theory there definitely is a limit: where there are not enough people to fill all the required roles. However, it is entirely possible that among our new technology there will be advanced AI and computer memory. We may end up being able to build robots and upload all the necessary information for them to do many jobs for us. This would end up with everyone being employed in robotics manufacturing, until we build robots to do that at least. So yes, there is definitely a point where this will happen. However, if our technology advances at the right rate then we may be able to save it by building helpers. 

First and foremost, not everyone would be able to survive. Much of it depends how quickly this warmup happens: if it's quick and the ice melts very quickly, people on the coast aren't going to get out in time and you'll get much loss of property and life. If it's slower, you'll get less loss but more people competing for the remaining land. This is the important point really: all the remaining people are going to be competing for much less land. It has been estimated (I'd link it if I could find it) that we'd lose 10% of the Earth's landmass if the ice all melted. The current estimate is that Earth can support around 9-10 billion people (call it 9.5 for now). With 10% less land, that figure goes down around 10% as well (not exactly because of other factors such as percentage arable land, but near enough), so we'd only be able to support 8.65 billion. Theoretically that's doable, but it's not going to work out that nicely. The heat wouldn't be too much of a problem. 50F is what, 30C? If we stay inside most of the time and most buildings are air conditioned we could survive. It won't be comfortable though. Finally, think of the impact of more people trying to squidge into the same space. We'd have to make space for some less desirable groups in our countries, such as IS and Al-Qaeda. Admittedly them killing people faster than ever before is going to make more space for everyone else, but do you really want another Holocaust? 

Just for the moment, let's assume the possibility of this situation actually happening (it's unlikely, but I'll leave that for later). I think, due to human nature, someone would eventually make the same discoveries, even if we don't colonise (though again, I think we'd do that too). On the point of discoveries, we would eventually be able to discover that the world is round due to other technology. For example, although it may take us a little longer, we would eventually develop satellites, which would show us pictures of a round world. Or, of course, people could just try sailing East without stopping to prove the roundness. More to the point, given how militaristic humans are, I suspect that someone would get suspicious pretty soon that all the ships are disappearing, even as food and technology and ships get better, and eventually they'd just send warships and heavily armed soldiers over to find out what really happens to all the ships. Admittedly this strategy would still be vulnerable to the strategy you outline, but if several warships and boatloads of soldiers disappear people will get really suspicious. On the other point, colonisation, due to the reasons above, we'd eventually send enough troops (and other people too, later on) over to be able to control the entire country. 

Sexism as we know it would disappear. No more "woman in the kitchen" stereotyping; no more "man at work". Since people would have the opportunity to experience how both sexes work and operate internally, there would be greater understanding between people. To put more bluntly: women would understand being kicked in the nuts, and men would understand bleeding from your nether regions every month. I'm going to go out on a limb and say there may also be a fairly significant number less suicides. Since sexuality-related discrimination would be far rarer, teenagers especially would feel they don't need to conform as much, and thus if they can't they wouldn't feel pressured into ending their own existence. However, this would, as bowlturner says, open up the market for "selective employment" based on physical qualities. Since men are generally stronger, construction companies might choose to only employ men; if a woman wants to work in construction she can change herself to a man. 

This does explain your Star Trek point: perhaps the technologies that enable them to zip across the universe so quickly have been refined through physics and engineering so they don't actually use that much power: thus, the power required is still in their power available to harvest. They have been able to refine this technology because they have knowledge of physics and engineering more advanced than their ability to harness power. Probably they set their scientists onto developing interstellar travel instead of power generation. And yes, I am proud of my ASCII bar charts. 

As an added bonus from the comments: these will be the rarest elements, but how do we get them? As HDE says, taking a trip over to the nearest stellar remnant wouldn't be the most fun of adventures, nor would heading for a black hole to collect the remnants of a supergiant gone supernova. Fortunately, there is a solution. It lies in the way new stars and systems are created. When a star dies, it leaves behind a dwarf, neutron star, or black hole. Either of the first two are, over (very very very very long periods of) time, broken up1 and they form nebulae, the interstellar clouds from which new systems are created. The elements that end up in each planet of the system come from this cloud. So, if you visit the nebula of a past supergiant that didn't go supernova, you'll find all those lovely rare elements there. Black holes, however, may become an occupational hazard. 1: Physicists, don't batter me: I only have very limited knowledge of this process. 2: Stars will only produce elements heavier than iron at the end of their life, releasing them on supernova because they are made in the core. 

It's probably possible but probably not practical. Looking at the method by which they might obtain hydrogen: you suggest electrolysis. This is certainly possible, though its efficiency is limited. The overall $ \Delta H $ (energy change) for this reaction is: $$ H_2O \text{ } \unicode{x2192} \text{ } H_2 + \frac{1}{2}O_2 $$ $$ -285.83 \text{kJ} \text{ } \unicode{x2192} \text{ } 0 + 0 $$ $$ \Delta H = 285.83 \text{kJ} $$ Source This essentially means that you have to put 285.83 kilojoules of energy in to get one mole of hydrogen out. Taking some numbers from here and Google, we see that 1 mole of hydrogen can lift 0.027kg, or 27g. If we're thinking of a little flower here, that's entirely possible: 1 mole of hydrogen can lift that weight on our planet. (If your planet is smaller, the gravitational constant is lower and the hydrogen can lift more mass). There is still the slight problem that 1 mole of hydrogen takes has a volume of 24 litres... so the plant is either really big with thin walls or it explodes under the pressure. Could the plant produce enough energy to create that amount of hydrogen? Yes - one mole of glucose going through respiration produces a $ \Delta H $ of -2880kJ, meaning the reaction is exothermic or releases energy. The average plant easily goes through 1 mole of glucose in less than a day - so as long as this plant doesn't require any more that a full load every day, it can be done. You just have to reshape your plants a bit. As for the evolution of this trait, I'm not so sure - I'll leave it to someone more biologically knowledgeable than me to divine why the plant would need this ability. 

I should also note that in most of these steps, you're going to need more and more advanced tools than the last. You might want to set up a team of engineers at base to make you new tools. 

I think number three is the most viable option here. As a bonus point, rewinding could leave signals. Whenever someone rewinds, their aura or rewindium cloud or whatever changes. A bit like someone releases a lot of rewindium dust into the air in the location of the rewind. The dust decays after a while, but the rewinder would be detectable by other rewinders who can sense the dust. 

We'd get on the phone to some of the people who did it the first time. No, seriously. We have a lot of experts in this field who are still alive, and they may well hold enough knowledge between them to build a working BIOS. From there, we can carry on the process a lot faster than it was done the first time: we simply consult the next set of experts for the next bit of knowledge, which we use to construct the next level of software up. Eventually, this process gets up to the experts at Microsoft and all the big computer companies who make and maintain the languages we use today, and they simply press F5, compile the language's source, and provide us with a fresh new set of binaries. The bigger problem here is redistribution. If everyone's binaries have disappeared, you need to either reconstruct every computer, or have everyone buy a new one. And then for some of the new languages that aren't pre-installed, you need to beef up your distribution servers so they don't crash when everyone tries to get a copy at once. 

However the discovery of space is made, there's a lot of discoveries to be made until this society is anywhere near our understanding of the universe. They'll end up several hundred years behind on astronomy, but could well do better than us in other fields, having had more time spent on them because of not spending said time on space exploration. 

Supervised evolution is known as selective breeding - you have a population, and you select the individuals with the traits you're looking for to breed with each other. Eventually, those traits prosper and you evolve the population to have that trait intrinsically. To get giants, don't let anyone shorter than the 95th percentile of height reproduce. 

You can quite easily do both. Rescuing the ship's people is the easier task. Deploy the lifeboats of the stricken ship with as many crew as possible in them (with current regulations, there should be enough for all crew but in a post apocalyptic society there may not be). Any remaining crew can be evacuated with helicopters equipped with winches. Sea Kings and Merlin helicopters often come with this equipment already on board. You can recover the ship in one of two ways. 1. Take it under tow You can come reasonably close in another ship, throw a catching line across to a remaining crew member, who can then pull a steel tow hawser across from the tow ship. Once fastened, this line should be made as long as possible to reduce the collision risk, but you would at lease have some control. 2. Side-along tow or Sandwich Ships This solution is better suited for calm weather. A ship comes alongside the stricken ship, fixes lines bow and stern, and moves away taking the unfortunate with it. However, given that the stricken ship has no power, the tow ship needs to use its side thrusters for movement to avoid going round in circles. This problem can also be solved with "sandwich ships", where a ship comes alongside on both sides and fixes on. Although this requires two ships, it does solve the problem of going round in circles. 

That's right, the first coins have been invented. But the next problem is thievery. There's no way to prove whose gold is whose so it's easy to steal. But the city guards come to the rescue. 

Wikipedia says that wood contains $14.9\text{ MJkg}^{-1}$, or $10.4\text{ MJkg}^{-1}$ at 70% efficiency. If you're burning your wood as a fuel source, then it'll burn at significantly less than 100% efficiency; 70% seems around right to me so we'll say 10 megajoules per kilo. Enough wood to build 50 homes? You have a lot of wood there. About 30,000 board feet of wood goes into a house, which is about 262.5 tons[1]. Multiply by 50 and you get 13,125 tons. (Where are you even storing all of this??) However, that measurement is for all hardwood timber, which 14,000 board feet of the house is not, so we'll drop the measurement to 10,000 tons. So: $$ 10,000\text{ tons} = 10,000,000\text{ kg} $$ $$ 10,000,000 \times 10\text{ MJkg}^{-1} = 100,000,000\text{ MJ} $$ $$ = 1 \times 10^{11} \text{ J} $$ That's equal to 27,778 kWh. One kWh can run a heater for half an hour - thus, these 27,778 kWh can heat 50 rooms for 278 hours.
