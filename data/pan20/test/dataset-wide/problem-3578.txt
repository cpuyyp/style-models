To help put it in perspective: Your average 8oz cup of tea contains 26mg of caffeine; about the same as a 12oz can of soda, which contains 29mg of caffeine. 3 sugar cubes is about 7g of sugar (27 cals), while a can of soda has about 33g of sugar (138 cals). So, 5 cups of tea with 3 cubes of sugar each would be about the equivalent of a single can of soda's worth of sugar and 5 cans of sodas' worth of caffeine. It's generally recommended that you eat no more than 25g of added-sugar per day (or 5% of your daily caloric intake, whichever comes first), but it's best to limit it as much as possible. High blood sugar will cause insulin spikes which can cause your body to store extra fat and prevent muscle gain. The best time to consume sugar is after a workout, since it helps restore glycogen levels. It also helps optimize the absorption of creatine if you take supplements. A single cup of tea with 2-3 sugar cubes after a workout should be relatively harmless and may even help your recovery, but if you're going to be drinking a lot of tea throughout the day, I would recommend using less sweetener or calorie-free sweeteners such as stevia (i.e., Truvia). On the contrary, if you're trying to lose weight, a cup of tea (preferably green tea with no added sugar) right BEFORE your workout is shown to raise your metabolism and aide in fat-burn. 

Last night I wore my heart rate monitor while sleeping to determine what my resting heart rate was. This morning I checked and the lowest my heart was beating was 48 bpm and the max was 100 bpm, the average was 65 bpm. So is 48 bpm a valid resting heart rate, or does my resting heart rate have to be checked while I'm conscious? Update: Redid the test but after waking up and got a 54 bpm while I was awake. 

I sometimes get muscle soreness from a fairly hard workout, but I don't apply any gel or cream on it as the pain goes away in a couple of days. But if you're feeling something that's chronic then apply gel then see a doctor. 

If you lack calories your body will start to cannibalize itself in order to survive which means you will lose muscle mass whether you want to or not, unless you have a good store of body fat. But I would assume to stay fit you would probably need to do some aerobics to keep your joints and muscles warm and in good condition for the eminent escape, if you get the chance. 

Generally, you want to take in about 20g of protein and some carbs after any workout, particularly resistance-training, sprints, and high-intensity cardio. This is the point at which your muscles are in their greatest state of recovery, and having a high-protein environment is important for that. Some people may choose to take BCAA in lieue of a post-workout meal. As long as you eat some complete protein or take BCAA, it should speed up muscle-recovery. If you take creatine, it's also recommended that this be done immediately after a workout. 

Carbo loading is generally recommended for endurance events - anything longer than 90 minutes at a moderate pace. In addition, carbo-loading typically has to be done several days in advance. It's possible to glean benefits from carbo-loading the day before, but only if you've been actively maintaining your glycogen stores by replenishing them after excercising. Basically, a 5k run isn't long enough to use up your glycogen stores unless you're really not getting enough carbs in your diet, so the carbo-loading is kind of pointless. It also depends on the type of foods that you're using for your carbohydrates. Grains can negatively impact your performance, especially wheat glutens which create inflammation. The general recommendation for eating before a 5k is simply to eat a good meal 3-4 hours before the event. Something with complex-carbohydrates - e.g. fruit and whole grains - not simple carbs like sugar, as this can spike your insulin levels and make you sluggish. If you wanted to feel what it's like to run out of glycogen during a run, I'd suggest doing a 20k (or half-marathon). Without carbo-loading beforehand, you'll likely deplete your energy stores and enter a state of low blood-sugar (aka "hitting the wall") about 15km or 90 minutes into it. Over time, endurance training increases the amount of glycogen that your body can store, so you can run longer before hitting the wall, as long as your glycogen stores are full. 

Last year I went to the Montreal Salsa Convention and had lots of fun dancing all those 5 nights. I had bought trail mix bars and whole grain stuff and lots of proper health food to keep me energized, etc. I had taken a couple of days off of work to help me recuperate. But still within a few days after the convention was over I was super exhausted. I couldn't concentrate. During dance lessons I had no strength and got sent home by my teacher. And the Saturday of the next weekend I had a lot of trouble getting out of bed and it didn't happen until 2pm. Mentally I was in great shape, but physically I was done. It took me a couple of months to fully recover. What are some things I can do to help me recover faster? I'm currently taking BCAA for the gym. The guy at the nutrition store mentioned taking glycogen replenishers which kinda makes sense. But wondering if glycogen depletion is the real issue. 

I will take a stab at it and say it lactic acid build up in the muscles. It has to do with your muscles not efficiently burning its energy due to a lack of oxygen and so you get a build-up of lactic acid. It used to happen to me when I was younger, but not as much now. Lactic Acid Build Up and Soreness in Muscles 

Whether or not you eat before a workout is relatively unimportant, but there has been a lot of debate about working out in a "fasted" state (such as a morning run before breakfast). It's a method used by bodybuilders, models, the military, etc. to keep lean. According to this article, which has some very good information and links to various studies, there is a fair amount of evidence to suggest that doing cardio in a fasted state can increase fat-burning by up to 20%, but the long-term effects are less noticeable. In addition, resistance-training in a fasted state may hinder your performance and cause a breakdown of muscle fibers. 

Sites like bodybuilding.com, Men's Fitness, Muscle & Strength, etc. still use terms such as "endomorph, "ectomorph" and "mesomorph". These so-called "somatotypes" were invented by the psychologist (and possible eugenicist) William Herbert Sheldon, Jr. Sheldon tied each of the bodytypes to certain personality traits, and his research has been discredited time and again as racist hogwash. That being said, if so many of these respected fitness websites make reference to the somatotypes, is it because we've since proven there to be some accuracy to the distinct body types without the connection to personality? Or is this just a case of bad science being hard to wash away. 

I've started taking supplements that contain L-Arginine. The results so far have been amazing, except for the fact that the days I take the supplement I have gas all day and need to excuse myself about 3-4 times a day at work to get a desperately needed release. Is there some issue with the way or time I take the supplement, or maybe there's something I can do to reduce the gas build-up. I take naNO Vapor Hardcore Pro Series in the morning about 30 minutes before training? 

I've started using MuscleTech's Anabolic Halo about a couple of weeks ago and I've gotten really big with it. Some body parts have grown by over an inch and 8 pounds. One of the ingredients it includes is Creatine Monohydrate and wondering how much of the gains are water and how much is muscle. Is there a way to tell? BTW, I had been experimenting with Creatine Monohydrate alone a couple of months ago with the same results, although never gained more than 5 pounds and only my legs had gotten bigger. Plus after I stopped using it lost the increased size fairly quickly. Let me know if you need more info. BTW, Some of the reviews I have read suggest there is actual muscle gain and not water gain. So not really sure what to think. MuscleTech Anabolic Halo 

I can only speak from experience as someone else that usually works out a few hours before going to sleep. I often have the same problem, particularly after cardio due to the elevated heartrate, but sometimes after weightlifting too. The best thing you can do for yourself is to establish a night-routine that will help relax your body between a workout and sleep. Personally, I just read for an hour before I go to bed (preferably fiction, not a technical book). This should bring down all of your vitals and allow you to fall asleep more easily. A cup of decaf tea/coffee also helps. Try to avoid carbs right before bed if you have a post-workout snack/meal. I fall asleep easier if I just eat something with protein like nuts or edamame. Your muscles will likely be tense after a workout, which can also prevent sleep. To help this, I'd recommend self-massage, otherwise known as myofascial release. This works EXTREMELY well for me, and it's quite relaxing (a bit painful). Your gym likely has some of these foam rollers in stock. If not, you can purchase one cheap on Amazon. 

3-5 grams of creatine per day (1 of your pills) is generally considered a safe amount. There has been evidence of liver/kidney damage as a result of taking too much Creatine, but seems to only be the case with people who already have kidney/liver problems. Studies have shown that as much as 20 grams of creatine per day is safe. The only real downside is water retention (i.e., bloating). Taking a lot of creatine will cause an average person to gain around 5 lbs in water-weight (which will only go away when you stop taking creatine). Humans typically get half of their Creatine from meat, specifically red meat, so it's definitely more important for vegetarians. You may choose to do an initial "loading phase" where you take 2-3 of those pills per day for 1-2 weeks to build up your initial stores. Then you can maintain your Creatine stores on 1 of those pills per day. On the flipside, you may want to consider doing your maintenance on only half a pill per day. 2 grams is shown to still be effective, while minimizing water retention. A lot of bodybuilders choose to "cycle" their Creatine. They may only use it for a month, and then not use it again for 2 months. They use it professionally as a supplement for beating personal plateaus. But whether you want to cycle it or use it daily is up to you. 

You should be breathing properly while doing cardio, in through the nose and out through the mouth. When you're reading you often forget to breath. That is the reason why you shouldn't read while doing cardio. Of course if you can do those all at the same time, then go to it. 

I would say that you start doing some reading. Either browse the magazine rack to see what's there and pick a few and read them. Or read what's on the internet. See what other people do to exercise. Could be all you're interested in is cycling. Or maybe you want to be the next Arnold Schwarzenegger. If weight training is what you are implying, then maybe join a gym and hire a personal trainer for a couple of hours to show you the ropes. They're a tad expensive, but may be a good start. 

I've been wondering for a while where protein to build muscle comes from? If I consume protein throughout the day and that protein is pretty much digested and processed within an hour or two of consumption. But most muscle building happens while at rest, how does the protein I consumed at 5:00pm make it to bed time? 

In addition to the points made above, HIIT also has the added benefit of EPOC to recover from oxygen deficit during the anaerobic "sprinting" stage. That can increase your metabolic rate up to 13% for up to 48 hours (decreasing over time). The optimal way to lose fat is a good combination of aerobic, anaerobic, and HIIT exercises. HIIT will give you the most bang for your buck and result in a heightened metabolic rate long after your workout. Strength training will have a similar effect, due to the added stress on the body of repairing muscle tissue. The real benefit from strength training is that it helps prevent muscle loss while you're at a calorie deficit. Strength training will also increase your levels of Human Growth Hormone and Insulin Growth Factor. Deficiencies in HGH/IGF have been shown to cause excess fat, and increasing them will help burn fat especially around the abdominal area (belly fat). Like HIIT, cardio/aerobic exercise will burn extra calories and increase your metabolism during the exercise and for a shorter time afterward. HOWEVER the true benefit of cardio is that it increases your metabolic efficiency over time. In other words, the more cardio you do, the more efficient your body becomes at using fat for energy. You could technically lose weight without doing any cardio at all, but it's important for maintaining the calorie deficit and getting the most effect out of your exercise routine over time. Summary: 

The lowest I have gone is 6 reps per set for heavier weights and up to 20 reps for lighter weights. I will often do a high number of sets when I use the pyramid method, ranging from 8 to 20 reps depending on the weights used and if I'm increasing or decreasing weight. But I just read an article where the writer mentioned in passing doing 2-3 reps per sets. Does this particularly achieve anything? Usually if I do really heavy weights, I will push for 6 reps, but never actually aim for less. So the question is, is there any benefit to doing a really high number of reps and particularly an extremely low number of reps. 

I've done both riding a bike and roller blading. Biking never did much for me except the pleasure of riding, but roller blading did, especially after having gone to the gym. Roller blading burns off a lot of calories and if the trail is well paved, you could alternate between the two. This one year I was roller blading twice a week along this paved trail along Ontario Lake and lost a lot of weight without trying. 

I love doing back weight exersises, especially the Seated Cable Rows with a narrow grip with the stack set at my body weight of 210lbs. On two occasions I've performed 3 sets of 10 reps and I feel great afterwards. But then I'll be out of commission for a week while my body recovers. So how do I change this workout? Decrease the number of reps, sets or less weight? I'm afraid of doing less weight to failure and ending up worse.
