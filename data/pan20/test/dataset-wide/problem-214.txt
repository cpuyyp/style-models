I do not know if more dangerous rays can trigger the same reaction in the skin as UV light does, but I expect they don't. These people would most probably suffer lack of melanin as well as vitamin D. So they would need some sort of artificial sunlight source. Expect european people to be a bit paler if they do not attend their artificial sunlight exposures, but otherwise there shouln't be much difference. Tanning and skin color have very little to do with each other. One is a reaction of skin on dangerous environment and the other is a genetical predisposition. 

What would happen? Probably the same thing that happened with diamonds. Natural gold would be still as rare as it was, and the manufactured gold would be for electronics and industry in general.(if the information would be public). If the government managed to keep this a secret, then people would ask, where is this gold coming from? SO there would need to be some kind of coverup... Government paying treasure hunters to excavate gold from spanish ship-wrecks and then manipulating the numbers, fake international transactions, fake gold mines in desolate locations, etc. 

I will go full rebel here and instead of thinking about railguns and gauss rifles and tasers and zat'nik'tels and other complicated stuff, I will give you some examples of what we already have. Gas pistol. No gunpowder, incapacitates opponents, effective range - 4.5 m. Grenade launcher with tear gas. Incapacitates opponents, has the range, can use compressed gas instead of gunpowder. Harpoons and slingshots. Look for the slingshot channel on Youtube. Legal & dangerous. Air guns. Some air guns could be used for hunting big game. power, range, no gunpowder. With the right ammunition you could make a riot gun. 

Homeopathy Homeopathy is an alternative medecine, proven to be no more effective than a placebo. However, not everyone is aware of that and some countries like France use it as a common medication. Your character is in this case: he think that homeopathy are medication, take lot of pills, some alcool, fall asleep due to alcool, but have nothing because they have no active substance Fun fact: during the 10:23 Campaign, some skeptics performed a "mass suicide stunt" with an overdose of homeopathically diluted snake poison, belladonna and arsenic, in an attempt to publicly show that homeopathy does not work 

As stated in the comments, it depends a lot on your personality, so here are 3 possible things to do if you have a generic algorithm for any NP-complete algorithm: The Good reveal that you have solved P=NP, with a proof (breaking a private key should be ok), but reveal the way to do it after a choosen amount of time, like one year. Why? So that world can change. P=NP would have lot of effects on many fields, including critique one like cryptography. 1 year should be enough so a large amount of application switch to more secure way (longer hash, one-time password...). Also reveal that your government also know it so critical system adapt immediately. After one year, reveal the algorithm, create an open-source organization with the money of Clay's prize The Bad Beside cryptography, there are lot of NP complete problems, knowing how to resolve them can improve lot of things in many fields. Make your own company exploiting such algorithm as travelling salesman problem, without revealing the code. Everyone would want your software, are they are much more efficient than others. However, doing this alone would be hard, choose wisely your coworker and prepare to be attacked regulary as other people would want to know your secret algorithm. The Ugly You can be one-time millionaire with Clay's prize. You can be multiple time millionaire with your new software company. But that's not enough, you want to be billionaire. Mine bitcoin, steal bank acounts, sold protected documents... the more illegal it is, the more money you get. As for stock exchange, diversification is the key, and avoid to exploit only one security breach on one field, as it would collapse and reveal something. 

Gun dragon Your dragon takes a rock between his teeth, heats it up with his flame and then using a explosion inside his mouth spits the stone over greater distances, than normally possible. This means that he has oxygen as part of his dragon breath fuel, so that it can explode in a somewhat sealed space. Beetle dragon This dragon is a "black sheep". He can not breathe fire, but he can spit hot acid like this thing. Other dragons hate him, because his attacks completely ignore their fire resistance, they were building for milleania. Worm dragon This dragon didn't like the others much, but he became a friend with a strange worm from a desert. This sand worm taught him to how to make lightning come out of his face. Now they eat horses in Mongolia together. 

Related to my other question. What would be best conditions for a natural super colony of pearl oysters and the best conditions for them to produce pearls naturally. Shallow or deep waters? Slowly decreasing, long shore or rocky waters? Periodic currents around the island or continuous current? (To increase the chance of sand getting into the clams) Warm water? Coud it be combined with a coral reef? Reefs forming circles around the island or a star / squid like layout? I would also like if the conditions allowed the pearls to wash up to the beach. You can have anything you want as long as it can create a paradise for the clams. The conditions don't have to be caused naturally. I have a lot of handwavium to make it happen. (If it would be impossible to do with just one island consider if several islands could make enough glitter. And then I'll join it together with MAGIC or something) 

TLDR: alternate realities are unpredictable Have you ever heard of butterfly effect? the smallest change can have some really big impact. By doing time travel, you become the butterfly. That means that once you travel, the past is the same, but the future can be really different. You want to prevent your friend to be shot. So you go back in time, and install bulletproof glass in his car. Bad luck, the butterfly effect have changed the hitman hired to kill your friend, and this hitman use poison instead of guns. Sadly for your friend, bulletproof glass is useless against arsenic. repeat as many time as you want. As "he just can't do it every time he wants", the attempts are limited 

As in real-life: firearms would be known but not used in massive way You mention pike and shot warfare, but that strategy appear circa 1500. However, firearm where known since several decades. here are some examples: 

If gunpowder and firearm where known since more than 150 years, why wasn't they used more? Because as you said, they need to be used en-masse to be effective, so even if the technology is known, it would be used only once the economy would be good enough to have large armies Edit In a recent edit, you say that your firearms are more powerfull and accurate than medieval firearms, and therefore good even if not used en-mass. What you got is a new kind of crossbow VS longbow debate. The benefit would be that it ask less training, but cost more and are maybe less powerfull than a longbow army. Depending on the cultures, some would use it, some not. During the 100 year war, longbow where widely used in England but not in France, why? because english were trained to use bows. Hunting rules where less restrictive than in France, they where archery event to practice during peace, and lot of other factors, so when war come, you already got experienced longbowmen. You can't take a random peasant and give him bow, he need training. It's much easyer to do this with a crossbow, that require less training. Firearms require even less training, and have another advantage: it require no particular physical force, unlike longbow or crossbow. You can recrute much more people (younger and older people, even women if you are willing to accept that). Basically, either you pay for training, either for equipment. Depending on the context, one would be prefer to another 

Devolution doesn't happen explicitly. Evolution can be forced in the opposite direction though. This could match what you intend to do. The driving force behind evolution For this example I am going to take resistance to antibiotics as evolutionary trait, but this is pretty much extensible to most other things. Competition is the driving force behind evolution. In bacteria, it is a constant race to be able to divide as fast as possible. Faster than your neighbor. After all, if you grow fastest, there will be more yous. In an environment where no antibiotics exist, the bacteria that can convert the surroundings into energy the fastest wins out. However, when we introduce an antibiotic that mimics the surroundings, but instead of being broken down, blocks the mechanisms of the bacteria, this all changes. That efficient bacterium will not be able to divide as efficiently anymore. So suppose there also is a bacterium that has another gene that allows it to prevent the antibiotics from entering its cell. This means that in the presence of antibiotics, this bacterium has an enormous advantage, because it isn't hindered by the antibiotics and will be able to divide just as normal. This is generally how resistance to antibiotics propagates through the population of bacteria. So what about "devolution"? There is one important piece here. Resistance to antibiotics isn't free. In this example it is producing some protein that blocks antibiotics, in another example it could be a modified protein that isn't a viable target anymore to antibiotics, but in (almost) every case, this resistance has a cost. Having to produce a protein, having a less efficient enzyme, and so forth. This doesn't matter in the presence of antibiotics, living is more important than that bit of energy. When there are no antibiotics however, these resistant bacteria are at a disadvantage. They are expending energy for something that has no benefit for natural selection anymore. The effect is that the unresistant bacteria will be growing faster and thus will be selected for. So what does this have to do with devolution? You can interpret this as devolution of the species, because the selecting criterium has been removed/changed so that what was selected for at first, is no longer useful. This doesn't immediately mean that that trait will be explicitly selected away, but given that most traits like this cost energy, if they are unneeded, they will eventually disappear. As another example, there are plenty of species that at some point in their evolutionairy tree had limbs, but developed in such a way that they did not need them anymore. Take whales for example. We know they have had limbs at some point, because there still are rudimental bonestructures looking like limbs. They have been evolved away though. There was no need for them, so there was no driving force preventing mutations that lowered effectiveness of these limbs. These traits might even have been beneficial, as growing limbs costs energy. Energy better spent growing fins for example. So to properly simulate the "Devolution of a trait or species", it is important that the selecting factor (if there is one explicit factor) is removed or made redundant. Important to note here though is that this is mostly devolution from the perspective of a certain trait, like legs. First legs evolve, then they evolve away again. This happens. Species turning back into older species is much less likely, because it is so many traits that have all changed, that would have to be selected against suddenly. 

There are a lot of answers and I tried to look for this idea, but I didn't find it, so. The god is testing his followers. He wonders about his followers. How long until they find out? Who will find out? A lowly monk or a high priest? Are the leaders of the church able to notice? If not are they still worthy of their position? What will be the reason for noticing the impostor? Will somebody be jealous of how quickly is the impostor rising in ranks? Or will they find flaws in his teachings and expose him? What if the impostor exposes the evils within the hearts of the god's followers? It could be just a lesson for the followers, so when something like a succubus tries to enter, they will know. Or the other god is trying to prove that noble god's followers are blind with pride or that some are evil. The god is truly noble, so he will not interfere and let the truth be revealed. Then there is the possibility that the real world could be radically changed if the god would interfere directly, so he asked other gods for help. 

Making bolts or arrows out of ice is not a good idea, the arrows could break under the strength of the crossbow, because the force has to come from the back of the projectile to the tip, that produces vibrations and bending. The long thin shape of an arrow is not optimal for these reasons, and it is the projectile that modern crossbows use. Arrows also need fletching, that you can not make from ice, because it needs to be flexible at least a bit. The smaller thicker bolt could work, but the kill would still not be guaranteed, since it could break easily if it hits bone, because you have fairly thin point made from a very brittle material. You could compensate for the vibrations with a tube, or go full Slingshot channel and use pressurized gas to propel the projectile. BUT have no fear, for I have found a different solution, that still uses ice projectiles and crossbows. But they are nolonger sharp and pointy. The answer to this problem is quite simple. Shoot hailstones instead of icycles. You get lots of ice bullets and this type of crossbow. Round projectiles are ideal even for a brittle material like ice. Hailstones have good aerodynamics (all round things have), they are heavy, they withstand the shooting as well as the impact.(as proven many times in nature) In nature they still do some harm, but if you use a crossbow, you can propel them far past their terminal velocity. This projectile also doesn't lose its functionality if it's in a warm environment, yes it will melt eventually, but while it still has enough weight it will work just fine, while the arrows and bolts will become dull. But even this projectile can be very light compared to the intended ammunition (lead), so unless you have a very powerful crossbow, don't expect good range or accuracy. If you want to make the bullets somewhat pointy, you could use a tear shape, like on sling bullets.
