On one of my bikes, and a previous one, I've had to use a second clamp around the seat post, with an aluminium spacer. Both are cheap steel bikes but even tightening the built in clamp as hard as I dare it doesn't hold. That's with no grease. On yet another cheap steel bike I snapped the clamp bolt trying to do it up hard enough to stop this happening. 

There are good reasons to stay to the outside of the bike lane (left in your case): Less debris, fewer potholes (e.g. around drains), better visiblity for both you and people you don't want to drive into you. There are also good reasons to keep tucked in, such as letting people pass easily (though this only realy applies in the lane is wide). If the bike lane passes parked cars , I'd want to be on the side further from them, even if the lane isn't a door's width. In Europe, including the UK, but to varying extents, the rule of the road (for cars and bikes) is keep tucked in (right in US/most of EU, left in UK) unless overtaking, for which you pull out. This seems much less the case in the US (certainly the LA freeways were interesting from this point of view), which probably affects cycling behaviour as well. Bike lanes that are wide enough to pass in are rare enough in many countries that the etiquette isn't well established. I don't think I've ever seen an on-road bike lane in the UK that was twice as wide as my (mtb-style) handlebars despite living in a relatively bike-friendly city; I have seen bike lanes that were narrower than my bars. Wider bike paths are often off road (and shared with pedestrians); passing there is less road-like and tends to happen on both sides. A polite warning is never wrong, though being heard can be tricky. 

You've got plenty of good options. I've got 40 000 km on a hybrid, including dirt roads, forest trails etc. but also 70km in 3 hours on tarmac. They're very versatile. Choose the right tyres (good anti-puncture every time) and you'll be fine. Until a few weeks ago I'd have suggested 35mm or 38mm Marathon Plus if you're riding the trail you show plus road. That hybrid has no suspension (you don't need it on those tracks) and can take front and rear racks. I wouldn't call that "rough terrain" at all. Any competent bike shop would be able to fit a rack and chain guard to a suitable bike -- and help you buy such a bike. However I've recently bought a tourer with a steel frame and 35mm Marathon Mondial tyres. They've got more grip on loose dirt than Marathon Plus (they're basically the same tyre with deeper tread; I'm actually going to swap to something with less tread). Having done very little dirt road on it so far I'm confident it will do a good job -- that, I suggest, would be your drop-bar option. Tourers are built to carry stuff, and have tougher wheels than most bikes (36 spokes instead of 32 -- I put a touring back wheel on my hybrid after breaking the rim). Cyclocross bikes are another possibiltiy but you have to be careful to get one that will take a rack and be sure you won't kick your panniers. However CX bikes are probably more fun to ride than tourers, and quicker on the dirt. I upgraded to the tourer for similar reasons to you -- I found I'd reached the limit of riding time/distance on the hybrid but need to carry a pannier more often than not. You have one more option, which I've hinted at. A minor upgrade to your existing bike would go a long way: get the back wheel rebuilt if you keep breaking spokes, and fit better tyres. The main reason not to do this would be if you find the gears inadequate -- a derailleur setup would be better. 

If it's like the one I've used, when the lock is unlocked you only need to remove 2 bolts. They're covered when the lock goes through the wheel (actually i think only 1 of them is but I'm not near the bike now). I don't think the mudguard is affected by taking the lock off but of course yours may be different and you may need to improvise something. In the end you'll just have to try it and see but you could add some pictures if you're worried. 

Gearing can be changed, though sometimes it's hard/expensive. Some adventure road bikes and almost all tourers have a much wider range of gears, but tend to be heavier than road bikes. The available width for tyres on a road bike can't be changed, and will limit your off-road use. Gravel is very variable; some is hard on road tyres while in other areas you need a bit of width in your tyres so you don't sink in. Starting from a cyclocross or adventure road bike is a popular approach for getting such a bike. I didn't do that because I wanted the long chainstays of a tourer (panniers + big feet). For a maximum of 100km and not racing, any of these bikes will be fine. If you're worried about speed, choose your tyres for the type of ride. Be warned though, you might think now that 100km is your maximum, but you might change your mind. A year ago that sounded like a lot to me, and I decided to buy my tourer. I did 230km yesterday. 

For commuting in warm wet conditions I found sports sandals ideal before (switching to clipless). A couple of things are worth noting though: 

Even a wedge bag would hold all your stuff except the helmet. Whatever you go for either clip the helmet on the outside or get a mesh helmet bag - helmets can do with some fresh air and a bag that will hold a helmet is quite bulky. I've got an Altura dryline -- not the cheapest option but it has a mapcase to go over the top and can keep a netbook and change of clothes dry. It would take a helmet for a small head, but not mine. I recently switched back to using it because of a baby seat. There are much cheaper options (example) out there as well, and most come with a shoulder strap. 

I use an Altura laptop pannier, and the shoulder strap is pretty good worn messenger bag style when you get off. It takes my netbook the wrong way round (it's made for big laptops) plus a change of clothes, toolkit, pump, jacket, towel and even a pair of shoes if necessary. If you don't have to carry the junk I sometimes do, and if you use a saddlebag for your toolkit it should take all you want (2 laptops probably, though only 1 in the padded case). Assuming you use a reasonably large laptop (IT pros generally do) you'll find it easier riding with the weight in a pannier. And I recommend a (reasonably) waterproof one. 

The pedalling forces don't screw the pedal in very effectively if the bearings are good. If the crank thread has taken a tiny bit of damage and is stiff (or it's just stiff anyway), pedalling won't screw the pedal in at all. You can demonstrate this without damage by putting a bike on a stand and trying to screw in the pedal by hand-pedalling, only touching the parts your foot would touch (engage a turn or two first). 

I've bought a new chromoly tourer. It's a very nice bike but I noticed (while on a rather wet ride the other day) a loose flake of paint that fell off when I touched it. It's on a rack-mounting lug, can only be a fault in the original paint job, and appears to be down to bare metal. It seems to me that this is a weak spot for rust to set in, and should be sorted out by the manufacturer or dealer. Would touching it in be as robust as a factory finish if they could come up with some touch-up paint? It seems silly to treat something that should be easily fixed as a warranty issue, but I don't want a spot that's going to let rust in. Am I overthinking this? 

To illustrate some of the variables: of my bikes, the easiest to ride no hands is the worst bike. It's a BSO from about 15 years ago, and there's something strange about the fork (I think the dropouts don't quite line up with each other). But it has a lot of trail and a short stem (which affects how the weight of the handlebars acts on the steering once you start to lean into a turn. If I carry a heavy lock on the bars it gets harder. Another of my bikes (a hybrid) is basically impossible to ride hands free, but it's got a D lock clipped to one of the forks so it's very asymmetrically loaded, as well as much less trail. The tourer can be ridden no hands but the riding position feels all wrong so I don't. That also has quite a bit of trail. Plus when I'd like to for a relief position the conditions aren't normally appropriate (traffic, other riders, poor road surface etc.) 

A phase difference of 90° is used sometimes. The power is more even through the stroke but handling is worse at low speeds among other downsides. Another post dicusses 90° out of phase and also slightly out of phase The second article suggests that most people ride exactly in phase because that's how tandems are set up by default. Changing takes some getting used to and a little fiddling so people need a good reason to mess with it. 

As the smallest cog is the same and the largest cog is smaller, the gear range is a subset of the old one. The old chain length should give you no problems at all. If you were going the other way a longer chain might be needed. 

I don't think (like the other answers) a suspension fork will do it. There's another reason as well - suspension forks only isolate vibrations in one linear dimension, as you go over bumps, as well as up and down you will accelerate and decelerate, and pitch up and down. So here are some other thoughts. We might be able to offer more help if you give some idea of what the object is. It's not unknown to use an underinflated inner tube as a shock absorber for light loads - but that's generally a flat object on a flat surface. Providing suspension for a light object can be done by hanging it in a frame using bungee cords (shock cords). The rubber provides some damping so it's better than just springs. Might be hard to fit between you and the bars - but then if I was doing 30km/h over rough ground I wouldn't want a set of forks pointing at my chest as you've shown. Either on a modified rack behind or in a modified front basket would be better. Whatever means you use, for best performance you need to tune the system - with some means of sensing the vibration (smartphone app these days?) and adjusting either the thickness of the cords or the mass. 

This was going to be a comment on Ryan's answer - which I endorse - but got too long (so I made it longer). I learnt at 20, on flat grass - a large garden, so know it can be done. 

A single-tube clamp has to be fairly tight to prevent rotation, especially if the bike is heavily/unevenly loaded. A double-tube clamp doesn't have to be as tight. Whether this is enough to allow you to use the double-tube version on fragile materials is another matter. The fit of the double version has to be much more precise. With some frames it just won't work. I wouldn't be confident about getting it to fit with rear disk brakes. 

On one of my locks none of the suggestions above would fit or work. Here's what did - hot glue: I ran a bead of hot glue round the (degreased) body around the hole where the shackle goes in, then inserted the (previously greased) shackle briefly. To make it easier I did one end at a time. I also had the shackle part way in while applying the glue, so I didn't push it into the lock body. It's quite possible to peel the glue off and have another go if it doesn't work. A similar trick can be done with silicone sealant but then you have to leave the shackle in place while it sets. Both glues will cut with a knife if you manage to glue the lock shut.
