The patch should obviously be bigger than the hole and maybe you'll want to overstitch the edges of both the hole and the patch to prevent them from raveling out. Oh, and please use a thimble to push the needle and prepare some pliers to pull it out, if you are sewing manually: cordura is really hard. 

Choose easy terrain, that you can predict will give you no surprises. Like hills instead of mountains. Or know your terrain beforehead: either you have visited this place before or you have studied it when there still was light (useful for training sessions). Don't try to cross hard unknown landscape, except in emergency. 

You can do most one-day trails with a pair of sneakers. It's much more comfortable, than any type of "hiking boots". And also much lighter (you spend less energy lifting it up many thousand times a day), and more blister-proof. IMO, there are three situations, when you need something heavier: 

It creates an air pocket around your boot, reducing heat loss. The snow now melts not on your boot, but on the overshoe, drastically increasing the time before your shoe gets wet (and cold). 

The latter is a very serious reason. With gloves off, if you stumble and fall on rocks hands first, you can easily get massive scranches or wounds. It is worse with a heavy backpack. Chances are that you will require medical attendence or get hard/unable to handle ice axe, etc. And with gloves on your hands would receive minor damage or not at all. There are also many technical activities, that are harsh to your hands, including rope work, self-arrest, ice-climbing, handling gas stoves. That is why in the mountains I wear gloves all the time when moving in any weather - except when strolling though really easy terrain with a light backpack. 

My wife is a doctor and she always wears gloves when dealing with wounds, even with friends outside of clinic. But when I ask her if I should wear gloves, she says it's not necessary. The reason is that the probability to catch a disease in, well, developed contries is quite small, so if you do it once in a year you are ok. But if you do it every day you will catch it sooner or later. If I had an unconscious stranger before me, I would first estimate the risk based on his social status (because there are no other clues) and than decide if I am going to take this risk taking into account that 

If you'd broaden "down" and "wet tents" categories to "all insulators" and "all wet items", it'll cover pretty everything, I think. Also a membrane jacket might stick to itself (coalesce) and may get damaged when you unstick it (membrane layer may peel of). One could think about rubber, which takes new shape under prolonged pressure, but it's not what you are usually carrying in your backpack. Thin metal parts like tent poles are potentially subject to this effect, but I'm not sure it actually happens. 

A good map is a must, it will provide your brain a lot of information you usually get from you eyes. That's a fundamental difference between day and night orienteering. Anyway, don't be overconfident. And expect to have you speed something like 2 times lower. It's harder to find and rescue If you are going to remote areas, take a friend or two. If you brake your leg it'll take much longer for emergency guys to get to you and to find you. It takes ages for a large group of people to find an unconscious man even in a tiny 1 km * 1 km forest at night. And if you are lost and start to worry/panic, he will help you calm down (or vice versa);) Starter's kit 

Mind the smoke and the wind Grass burns don't provide much heating, but the smoke makes it very hard to breathe, so don't rush into thick smoke it with your bucket of water. Always escape upwind if you have the choice. There is no smoke there and fire spreads much slower in this direction. 

Though there is no scientific answer, you can make use of some experience-based guidelines. They vary much and none is "true". There are some of our local considerations: 

You can try to shop for something like this, but you can easily create it yourself as in the picture above: fold a cloth to make a sack, sew 3 sides of 4, add some laces and that's all. You can use any synthetic (and maybe waterproof) cloth like Oxford or Cordura. If your sewing skills are higher, you might end up with something more attractive and better shaped: 

Cold (cold air, cold metal, cold rock/ice). Rain and snow, which make it even colder Sunburns Scratches and wounds 

The type/model of the stove The quality of the fuel The supply of oxygen in the air to support combustion (it should be a problem in a crowded tent) If your stove is wet or not (moisture reduces fire temperature and combustion effeciency) 

In Europe your will be hiking on altitudes less than 5000 m, and on these altitudes you can go with sunglasses without heavy specialized equipement. However not any piece of sunglasses will do. First, they have to be either made of glass (which stops UV rays) or special UV-proof plastic. Not every plastic stops UV rays, and if not, using it is even more dangerous than looking with bare eye: dark tint makes less visible light fall on your eye and the pupil gets bigger, accepting more UV light, which is not stopped by plastic. Most of plastic sunglasses are made of more or less UV-protective plastic nowdays. You will need the ones with UV protection factor 4. It the sticker on your glasses just says "protects from 99% of UV" without mentioning the protection class (2,3,4), it is not enough. I would also make sure that the manufacturer is reliable, because if they cheat, it may cost you your eyes. Second, you have to choose a model which blocks as much of side light as possible - they have to fit perfectly without gaps. No gap from below is absolutely a must, a little light entering from the top is OK (there is no snow there, he-he). You can also allow for a little light from left and right sides, but try hard to minimise it. Sometimes a little duct tape will help to patch the remaining holes, as Ben Crowell have said already. Finding glases that fit you perfectly is not very easy, so you'll probably spend a lot of time at the stand and try a couple of dosens of models. If your sunglasses are made from plastic with good UV protection and they fit you well (in terms of no holes), they are enough for European altitudes and you don't need anything else. Bonus tip. If your drop and brake your glasses in the middle of the trail and the frame is more or less undamaged, you can improvise an UV-protectant solution by inserting paper instead of glass into the frame. Cut a narrow slot or hole in each "glass". You will be able to see something and block most of light at the same time. 

"How can I still enjoy outdoor life when daylight lasts only a few hours?" There is a plenty of ways: orienteering (on skis/snowshoes), skiing and multi-day ski trips, training in emergency/rescue operations. A certain change of mindset is required to keep outdoor activity an night, because it provides some challenges: It's harder to see, what you are doing So take a good headlamp, take an emergency set of batteries for it and take a spare headlamp if you are going solo. It's easy to set up a tent or collect wood in headlamp light. It's harder to do ropework, but it's definitely doable with some practice. So this is a merely technical issue, which one can adapt to. But also It's harder to see the environment The real problem is you can't see the environment outside of your torch beam and you can't see too far anyway. This means that you can't travel on difficult unknown terrain. I mainly mean steep slopes, rocks, drops, ... So you can walk and you can drop a rope, but you don't know where to go and what you'll find at the end of the rope (or two ropes down). What you can do? 

I believe that the best material is the same as you backpack is made of, though you may want something tougher if you are planning more scrambling over granite boulders. There is a plenty of Cordura varieties which will meet your requirements. Make sure to choose waterproof Cordura (with a waterproof glistening film on one side, which will be the inner side of your patch). Keep in mind, that when it comes to applying force (not friction), the least sturdy part counts, so technically you can't make it more sturdy than original material. To make it equally strong as it was before, you should 

This topic will be incomplete without mentioning the good old dulfersitz method used by our fathers when there were no belay plates and no carabiners. This method doesn't require any equipment other than the rope itself. And, well, sturdy clothes. The method is to pass the rope around your body in a special way shown in the picture 1 below. Picture 2 shows a variation with a carabiner. 

Hard terrain When you have loose rocks (scree), there is an increased risk to sprain your ankle or to get a rock falling on your foot. Small stones also tend to find their way inside your shoes. So high trekking boots with less ankle mobility are preferred. Snow also tends to get into sneakers, and they are often too slippery on the snow (and you can't effectively kick to make a "ladder"). For ice you'll need crampons, which just can't be used with sneakers (without adhesive tape, that is;)). If you have only a couple of rocks on a dirt trail, you don't need heavy boots. E.g. sneakers are perfectly fine for hiking one-day trails in Grand Canyon. Low temperatures Low temperatures thing is obvious. For this you will need a heavy boot, and make sure it's not too tight so you can use it with a warm sock. Heavy load If you backpack is heavy (I mean really heavy, on multi-day autonomous trips, 25 kg+ for me), the risk of spraining an ankle is also too high. If you don't have much experience with heavy backpacks, your limit may be lower: just upgrade to high boots if you feel uncomfortable. Bottom line On US trails there is a lot of hikers wearing unnecessarry heavy boots. Please consider lightweight sneakers first, if there is no real need to upgrade. You feet will say thank you. Also as @Wajurgmitr said, lightweight camp (aka fording) sandals are a good addition to main shoes (be it sneakers or hiking boots). 

LBell has neatly summarized, that folding leads to smaller pack and stuffing is just faster. I'd like to add some considerations here (being an adept of stuffing). Sometimes you have to fold (and carefully!) because of a tight bag supplied with your tent or tarp. The bag will be too small to stuff your stuff inside. In this case I'd recommend to throw away your original bag and find a bigger one. Someday you are going to have a really high wind which will make folding hard. Or your tent gets below freezing and accumulates some frost so that a roll will be too big. Or you will be doing it alone with your bare hands exposed to this frost and this wind. So you will need a bigger bag anyway. Taking this into acount, I see noo reasons to stick to folding when you can stuff;) As for the claim that stuffing waterproof material over and over is going to make it leak, I have seen it true, but only with really thick, rigid fabrics which produce starp corners. Modern tents are definitely not made of this. Well, at least good quality ones. From practice, I've got a 10 years old Vaude tent, which was heavily used and stuffed for all its life, and it still almost isn't leaking. 

Use common plastic bottles from sparkling beverages. They are lightweight. When they are empty, they can be smashed thin and take almost no space (you can do the same which a half full bottle, pushing out all the air). When you need them again, you inflate them back with water. So you can have a good reserve volume, which costs you nothing when empty. You can attach them to the exterior of your backpack with straps and they will take no space inside. If you lose one - shame on you for littering, but it can be replaced. I prefer 1.5 liter ones - as many as you need for you trip and weather.
