1) Vibration If you hold to the conservation of mass & energy, then the sonic energy output of a given reaction would be less than the sonic energy input, before you consider the potential energy released. I would assume that releasing potential sonic energy would be quite important to your world. Much as generating a spark to light a fire or tipping the first domino of an impressive display, the use of sonic energy to amplified effect through stored potential sonic energy would be a goal of those seeking power. Your world might have the equivalent of WMDs in those songs/tones/harmonics that produce such amplified effects. For example, a specific wail might cause stone to rend and scream in agony, which triggers a chain reaction in neighboring stone to the point of causing a mountain to explode in a cataclysm of rock shards. In other contexts, however, many reactions may well be defensive and specifically dampen the effect. For example, shuddering trees might cause a sound inverse to the axe's chopping so as to limit the number of trees that suffer from the sound. 2) Scale Reversing cause and effect, as suggested by @Saidoro, is an excellent choice. Having thunder cause lightning and a tremendous roar cause a volcanic eruption will emphasize the place that sound has in your world. This also opens up dramatic tension where a dormant volcano begins roaring and everyone knows to flee, or better yet, attempt to counter the sound, perhaps with calming songs that quiet the earth and lead to peace and stability. The inverse-square law also helps to explain potent local effects from relatively low energy (human voice) while not having the world end with the first volcano. Because it takes 4x as much energy to have the same effect at 2x the distance, an incredibly load/potent sound that is 100x as loud as what is required to kill everything within 3 feet will "only" kill everything within 30 feet. You need to get to 10,000x power to reach 300 feet. Decibels are already on a logarithmic scale to help with such comparisons. 3) Animals Silence would be even more important for most animals to avoid becoming prey, as noise would leave greater evidence of their presence. Animals would also, presumably, develop even more specialized sound-producing organs to assist in hunting, defense, and every other aspect of survival. For example, rather than a beaver that has teeth designed for cutting wood, you instead have a creature that can sing the song that bends trees to one's will to build living structures of wood. Just as animals have highly developed physical predator/prey equipment, such as teeth, claws, muscles, hide, etc., I would expect highly developed sonic abilities. Presumably human beings will be the top predator in large part through musical instruments and other sound producers that permit human beings to generate sounds far beyond the capabilities of another animal with similar lung capacity/strength. 

BONUS QUESTION: This page $URL$ says a man lived on coconuts from 1902 (and Wiki says he adopted a monodiet around 1905 or 1906) until imprisonment during WWI in Sept 1914, at which time he weighed 86 pounds. So, a while. 

Get In Me Belly! In a nutshell: for humans, "civilization" really got going with the agricultural revolution, which led to permanent settlements, which led to division of labor, elite classes, then writing and accounting. And of course, trade and war and religion and all the things you find interesting when you're not constantly starving. You Scratch My Back... But none of that would have happened unless we had the need and the means of invention. In this case, the "need" was safety. We evolved as social creatures. This is because numbers provide comparative safety compared to going it alone. Usually, prey animals like to stick together. It spreads out the risk of being targeted. When in groups, certain cooperative behavior tends to emerge. For example, most foraging herds or flocks develop a system of watching out for predators (vigilance behavior) and a simple set of warning calls. You also have some kind of understood communication. You may have cooperative parenting and group defense tactics (like how bovines often circle the wagons). This has been a successful evolutionary behavioral model for dozens of millions of years. But you don't see any animal "civilizations." That's because you also require intelligence. Keep Bangin' Those Rocks The thing about evolution is, mutations happen. Most of them are bad. But every so often a mutant has a (small) advantage over others in his generation, and that mutant gets to pass on the mutant gene, leading to more mutants. Some say you can look at intelligence as just another evolutionary feature. A cerebral and behavioral mutation that turned out to be kinda handy for dealing with situations that would kill a dumber individual (or get you laid more than a dumber individual). The thing is, human intelligence comes at a huge cost: calories. Powering a human brain can be 20% of a day's calories. So if you're gonna sport a brain, it had better be worth it or you're just as dead as any other idiot. So why did intelligence work out for humans? Because we're risk takers. (Is one theory, anyway.) As the changing climate turned forest into tundra, we were forced out of the trees. So we had to deal with new environments, find new foods, escape from different predators. Intelligence was good for that. As we became omnivores we had to come up with hunting tactics because we were pretty weak compared to the other animals out there. What's My Motivation? Civilization = Numbers + Food + Intelligence. Hyperparasites sound gross and it's not helping that there are probably hundreds of them infesting a single host. Ick! But that host is also probably in a group of hundreds infesting some other poor sap. Can you say Hyperparasite Party! Social behavior can be beneficial in any situation where two heads are better than one. I already mentioned predation. But also, maybe it's difficult to find and latch onto a host, so at some point in their evolution the hyperparasites figured out how to work together somehow and they increased their success rate. What's the "agricultural revolution" equivalent for hyperparasites? I would say these hyperparasites would have to make the leap from finding hosts in the wild to cultivating them in controlled environments. (This would be like if humans had ranches where we grew elephants that we lived in.) But since these are hyperparasites, it's obvious how to cultivate host-parasites: you cultivate the host-parasites' hosts! (This would be like if humans grew a lot of peanuts because elephants like peanuts and then when an elephant comes to eat the peanuts we move into the elephant.) The Great Material Continuum So, strangely, a hyperparasite civilization could actually start with the cultivation of the food that feeds the host upon which the parasite-host feeds ('cos hosts need to eat too). (This would be like if humans made a lot of fertilizer to grow peanuts, to lure elephants, to live in.) It's a pure and simple vertically integrated production model. You gotta admit that would take some smarts. 

I've just discovered this, so apologies for such a long delay! So, some thoughts: 1) information has to be encoded in something (e.g. spirit matter, energy patterns etc.) and its degradation would be, almost by definition, entropy. 2) Hence, would people try to limit the entropy as much as possible, once they worked out that the universe worked in this way? perhaps by encoding a specific memory in multiple ways (so at least one way would survive the trip back). Think, for example, of Thomas Edison's experiments to contact the dead, and Spiritualism as a whole, and some of the Buddhist meditation practices which are about surviving aspects of the afterlife , and so forth. In essence, people will attempt to 'hack' the system and seek a way around the problem. If at any point in time, the physics of 'energy patterns/spirit matter/whatever mechanism' are deduced, then a technology may be derived to minimise entropy, or force some edge-case in the physics which would allow a breaking of the rule... Perhaps. 3) Maybe I missed it in what you said, but if people can come back at any time, can they not come back at a time prior to their forgetting too much? Can they come back as their own re-incarnation, thereby immortalising themselves within a time loop? Could the go back to their living self, and retrieve what they have lost from their living former self? And then keep replenishing their memories? As for effects on religion: 1) prophecy would be big - and done right, more reliable; here's how my religion would do it: A) Supply a message you want to send to the past to a lot of people. B) Kill them all. C) They report to your former selves, but although entropy means they've lost information, they've probably not all lost the same information in the same manner, so each will have a small piece of the message. D) Apply statistical methods to put the fragments together and get some idea of the future. 2) Deceit via prophecy can be done in the same way - just get you're murdered population of death-travellers to tell lies (or lie to them all)... 3) What about temporal edge cases? Can you die/come back at the very edges of Time itself? The start or end of the universe? If you could retrieve any information from such times, you'd have clear stories about how the universe starts and ends. 4) There'll be stories in the myths of people from the 'future' meeting the heroes of the stories. Perhaps advising them etc. 5) Mostly, however, I'm not sure religion will be that different, because it already claims all these things. The only difference may be if there was a scientific means of demonstrating, verifiably, that the universe works this way... And given that we already live in a world where there are consistencies in the stories of people who have Near Death Experiences, where stories (cases) of supposed re-incarnation exists, prophecies etc.. I suspect it'll have the same scepticism we have now, which is kinda interesting, I think... 6) I think it all hinges on getting accurate, concrete factual information out of the dead/re-incarnated by some means. If that can be done, and repeatedly, then there's the scientifically verifiable proof one needs to turn religion into science and fact. Deceit aside, no more doubts about the afterlife, or the origins and end of the universe. Scientists will look for ways to exploit this for time travel, space travel etc. Governments and anyone with resources will try to gain prophecy as a means of power. Religion will die, and be replaced by the Science of the Hereafter. So my answer would be this: If no reliable information can be garnered, it'll be identical to what we have now. Otherwise... huge differences, but religion will be dead,replaced by a fascinating new science. Science if what you get when you put religion and magic under the microscope - Consider Newton - he spent more time searching for secret messages in the bible than formulating physics as we now know it. He studied alchemy. All this was because in his time, there wasn't a distinction between magic and science - science was born of magic once you worked out what the rules of the universe really were, and Newton etc. were merely trying to understand how the universe worked (by seeking underlying rules to phenomenon, such as reactions in alchemy, or 'magical' processes, and finding them wanting or verifying an effect which could be studied). Hope that helps! 

Retrovirus! A retro-virus inserts its DNA into the DNA of the host cell. Usually that is a regular somatic cell. However, it is theorized that retro-viruses can also insert their DNA into a gamete (sperm/egg) cell, and when that gamete creates an offspring, the virus' DNA is permanently incorporated into the somatic cells of the offspring. Then that offspring will create gametes with the virus' DNA and pass it on to the next generation! Let's say a retro-virus infects a single sperm. That lucky sperm joins an egg and contributes its half of the DNA+virus DNA to the new baby. That half could have genetic dominant traits that cause enough changes to mark the baby as a new species. Now multiply that out: For the population at large: you could have a highly contagious and infectious but harmless to the host retro-virus that attacks gametes both sperm and egg, thus making every baby diploid with the new DNA. (You might have to explain what effect the retro-virus has on such babies.) The new DNA should not be fatal, obviously, since you want the babies to be killed by the robots. How cruel you are! But you're storyline has to wait a while. "Species" is often defined by being un/able to produce viable offspring. You'd probably have to wait till these babies reached sexual maturity to find out that they cannot reproduce with non-infected but can reproduce with other infected. (Unless you have a way to determine fertility or reproductive compatibility strictly through blood or DNA or other tests. I mean obviously after you discover the incompatibility issue then you can just screen for the new DNA. I'm just talking about the initial realization that the infected constitute a new species.) 

For the purposes of this question, lets assume that we are in Edwin Abbott Abbott's Flatland, but the world is a disk, with living shapes Above, and 'dead' shapes Below (the underside of the disk). However, time runs in the opposite direction Below, so if A. Square died on Monday, and went Below (let's assume there a 'strip of paper', like a passage, which he traverses to go from the top of the circular plane, to the underside), and was dead for five days, but was then allowed to return the the world of the living, he would arrive the Wednesday before he died. I'm assuming that time is linear (no parallel universes), and that Cause and Effect operate, but not necessarily in that order. So, for example, A. Square might be able to warn his former living self of his impending death, but would do so knowing it will happen anyway (otherwise his ghost would not be there to give the warning in the first place). The other assumption is that events unobserved by anyone are indeterminate (i.e. a kind of Copenhagen interpretation of time). Can anyone see any logical issues with this? One concern is the travel via the 'strip of paper' connecting the top (Above) world with the Below world - would there be a point where A Square's ghost would be existing both in forward time, and backward time? Could this be done non fatally? incidentally, time Below doesn't involve people walking backwards, and broken glasses reforming; locally, it appears as if time is moving forward, just backwards relative to those Above. I've thought of one issue concerning computation: Imagine a machine which prints either the letter 'A' or 'B'. However, it is rigged to send this printout to its former self, and when the former self receives that printout, it is programmed to choose the opposite. So if it chooses 'A' it tells it's former self this, so it chooses'B', and visa versa. I'd imagine that such a weird 'paradox engine' would be in a suppositional state, like Schroedinger's cat in the box, until some highly improbable failure occurred to break it out of its loop (such as mechanical failure etc.) Would this mean there is a 'virtual' universe where the machine runs thousands of times before the improbable event occurs? I suspect this would mean our universe would occasionally have very improbable things happen due to such temporal feedback loops occurring in nature... The motivation for this is a fantasy story, where I'm trying to devise a mechanism for prophecy based on (as in much folklore) the notion of time working differently in 'fairyland'. 

I agree with @TrEs-2b basically. I also do not know of any examples of complete atavism but you can get pretty close. You asked if the wild-animal could evolve back into a humanoid "shape," and that is by definition what atavism is: phenotype not genotype. Fish to Mammal to Sea-Mammal to Land-Mammal Here's a non-homo example I think fits your idea. Whales and other sea mammals evolved from land mammals (which is where mammals first evolved, on land). Land animals (tetrapods) evolved from lobe-finned fishes, which are bony fishes. Whales look a lot like fishes but there are significant differences. Whales have lungs not gills and can't breathe underwater. Whales have hips and thigh bones, but they are small and don't grown into full rear limbs. Whales tailfins are horizontal, fish are vertical. So whales did not actually revert back to fish, but they sure look a lot like them. We could go one step further (for the sake of your question): sea mammals could start making forays back onto land! Now, being mammals, they have already solved a lot of the problems that the first land-dwellers had to overcome (like skin and eggs drying out). So for a sea mammal to become a re-evolved land mammal would actually be a bit easier, in theory! 

Castles, like any fortification, are designed to project power over an area and at the same time resist being taken over. What makes a castle different from a "base" or "bunker" or other fortification is crenelations, arrow slits, moats, double gated archways. These are all things designed to protect counterattackers and make it really hard for ground-based troops to enter. You said these castles have force-fields and anti-air defenses (anti-ship, missile, energy beam, god-rod, etc.). Well, once it's clear that air assault will not work, an attacking commander may well switch to ground-assault. It may be that force fields can deflect an energy beam, but maybe they can't stop a physical slow moving object (like a foot-soldier). So, perhaps high-tech weapons have cancelled each other out enough that old-school D-Day style frontal assault is the only choice. And what would be really handy when you've got thousands of armed troops running at you? Crenelations, arrow slits, moats, and gates. In reality, though, I would think a CIWS would take care of just about anyone coming at you. And those things are scary automated. So, to be fair I guess the foot-soldiers would have to have some pretty good armor. Totally doable.
