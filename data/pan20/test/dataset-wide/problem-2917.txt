When this is combined with the idea in mathematics that geometry is most natural form in which to view mathematics, gravity as a geometrical feature follows; if not its precise nature as curvature. 

Taking the symbol dx seriously is exactly what the geometrical notion of the infinitesimal is about, in that it aligns itself with the geometrical naivety that first brought the calculus to fruition. 

This looks suspiciously like something from an anecdote of Feynman from one of his popular collection of raconteuring tales to be told round a barbeque with a crowd of admiring physicists-in-waiting. Now, an electron is an essential object in modern physics; but no physicist will refer to it in that way - the usual terminology is a fundamental particle. It looks similar, but it isn't - as both these terms fundamental AND particle have certain meanings within the discipline of physics that one imbibes as one studies the subject. Essence is something that was begun to be discussed in antiquity - it has a long history that I'm not acquainted with. I imagine it is this tradition that feeds into Whiteheads book. To understand why he is interested in this - one should look at the tradition so that the term has some meaning. EDIT According to Aristotle, essence is what defines a something as opposed to merely talking about its existence. Horses have essences and so do bricks & electrons, but these only secondarily. It is substances that have essences primarily. This is the proper sense of essence. So the question should be refined - do electrons & bricks have essences primarily? The answer is, they do if they are substances. Now, a substance is neccesarily self-subsistent. Hence a brick is obviously not a substance. But is an electron? If we consider it to be fundamental as in QFT, that is atomic then it appears possibly yes. But this actually cannot be correct for do we not require spacetime for it to be in? So, no; it is not a substance. But suppose QFT is only an approximation to String Theory. Then strings are fundamental and electrons are not - they are vibrations of strings. Strings are not atomic since a string can always be split given enough energy - that is it is infinitely divisible. But they are neccessary to build matter. But are they self-subsistent? No, they are not. For they also require space-time. So, even in this theory they are not substances. Now suppose there was a hypothetical theory in which spacetime & electrons were vibrations of let us suppose of strings. Then are they substances? I think this time yes. For I can always imagine fewer strings, or just a string by itself. So, here strings are substances and are primarily essential. But, still an electron being a vibration of a string is not primarily essential. 

Occams razor states that given a choice between differing explanations one should always choose the simplest. Of course this begs the question as to what one could mean by simplest. I'm interested in situations in which the opposite principle has been found correct. That the more complex explanation wins out. A possible example could be: There is life only on this planet and it is carbon-based as opposed to there are many kinds of life on many planets and they are not neccessarily carbon-based. Given that choice the simplest seems to be the first, whereas I think the second, the more complex explanation is likely to be correct. 

But unlike Descartes axiom of solitariness whose solitude is his own solidarity; or the Socratic self-questioning Heidegger says, we are already amongst beings, we are in the midst of being having been thrown in there; this is why he says: 

When, one considers that Law as an idea must predates the invention of axiomatic systems by millenia, and that (at least to me) there is a clear correspondance of between the idea of Law and Axiomatic Systems. Whereas in the former, it is human beings who are subject to law, and in the latter it is the behaviour of (at least in Euclid) points & lines that are governed not through social institutions (at least directly) but through the individual intellect. One also thinks of 'the law of large numbers' and 'law of gravitation' where it appears this idea in a primitive sense appears. Has anyone explored this thesis? 

Simply because an idea is contemporary doesn't automatically mean that it's useful, correct or valuable - it can simply mean that it is modish; ie fashionable - only in hindsight will people have a clear enough insight to detect whether in fact it was useful, correct or valuable; some people will be clear sighted enough to see it then. Self-help books are the wisdom literature of today; this is a tradition with a venerable pedigree - there are scribes in Pharoanic Egypt that wrote comparable advice on papyri. They're orientated towards practical advice; and therefore aren't pseudo-philosophical - they aren't competing with actual philosophy per se. To add to Kings excellent answer: older anything is generally easier to make sense of than the most up-to-date scholarly work today: compare Newtons laws with Gauge theory; or Platos Republic with econometrics; or Euclids Geometry with Grothendiecks Schemes. And there are reasons for this - mainly that now is later than then, and depending on how one counts time, much later - exponentially later; this movement of time has generated from the seed of scholarly thought a tremendous apparatus (a dispotif in Agambens sense - taken from Foucault) within which contemporary scholars move as apparatchiks (as satirised by Borges in his inimitable hieratic prose, for example in his short story La Biblioteca de Babel (The Library of Babel). 

So, yes; you are right spacetime and the vacuum field on it is ontologically prior to something. And Krauss is silent where these come from, and indeed any explanation of really what a law of nature is and what it consists of. 

I can see why you could reason this way, but gerund is a technical term reserved for the study of grammar, and I don't think that this kind of usage slippage works until its already ratified by a scholarly community. Essentially all you're doing is rephrasing the first statement. As far as I can see you're using the Aristotelean Syllogistic reasoning; but the fact that you're slipping across different domains of discourse makes the reasoning shaky; and in fact shows up one of the weakness of syllogistic reasoning when meaning & context is not taken into account. Another example of this is: 

What is the truth of this statement 'Tommorrow I am going to eat an apple'? Its truth is indeterminate now. By the following day its truth will be determined. This example was discussed by Aristotle. 

George Orwell wrote an essay on The English Language, Writing and Politics which you might find useful: 

Check out Aristotles Physics where there is a discussion of this and which I found quite clear. The monists did not believe in the void they believed in a single thing/being the world could be reduced to - so monist. If I recall rightly, Russell points out Thales as the first monist for thinking everything is made of water. But Parmenides pointed out that if being is actual this means that there could be no change. This pushed the atomists to invent the notion of the void and atoms but Aristotle argues against the void and posits his notion of potentiality/actuality as the explanation of motion. Heisenberg used this notion of Aristotle to interpret QM. This returns as Thales: when you see a body of water water what do you see? Waves. So waves of potentiality and actuality in the body of being. 

Take Lucretian atoms, are they subject to time? For how they arrange themselves, when they move and collide; they are subject to time; but this is in relation to other atoms, or to the place they themselves are in. But atoms in themselves, and solely in respect to themselves, is that in time? 

Derrida was criticised for not being political enough, or so he declared in the introduction of Spectres of Marxism; so he wrote said book; but I suppose a book is not a party-political manifesto. Given that Derrida was born in Algeria; and spent his formative years there as a pied-noir; and which later went through a war of decolonialisation, he says surprising little about it in his official writings; or perhaps because he was a pied-noir he found himself constrained: 

This isn't an answer to your question but its too long to go into a comment. The examples you put forward for the border between synthetic & analytic being porous from Kant are commonly misunderstood examples from his ouevre, whether one subscribes to his description of conscious & reality or not. 

This idea has discernable effects in physics which leads to Bose-Einstein statistics in which probability does not behave classically. For example, two photons with the same energy are not discernable which is unlike two identical coins which are in fact discernable. 

Thamus, whilst praising the inventiveness of the most 'ingenious Theuth' reminds him to be cautious for 

Famously Einstein said if he had to choose between a beautiful theory and an ugly fact he'd take the theory every-time. Dirac remarked that he always followed beauty. It seems to me that aesthetic considerations must play a large role in contemporary physics through being conditioned by learning the theory. Part of this maybe what physicists call physical intuition. According to Popper scientific theories are never true but are always falsifiable. But as the theory develops these falsifying events (ie experiments) become more and more infrequent. What happens between these events? It seems to me that physics at a fundamental level must become a world unto its own (at a practical/applied level it must obviously remain involved with the world) in the same way as say mathematics is, and of course there aesthetic considerations play a large part even if they're not nominally thought of in that way. 

In Speculative Realism, Correlationism is defined as the term linking Thinking and Being. Is the term original to this movement or picked up from post-Kantian thinking? 

However when we look at it through topology, we also note that this real line is disconnected, its not possible to move from one point to another as none of the points are connected to another (here we're considering the real line dynamically). To satisfy this we arrange for the real line to have a topology, its standard topology; these are composed of open sets; every open set has extension. Now, in what is called pointless topology we can remove the points, and this still gives us a line, except here there are no points - why? because they are extensionless, and have no ontological weight. 

This amplifies and analyses the older idea of a word 'dog' (the sign or signifier) and the dog itself (the signified); but notably now a picture of a dog is also signifier; and similar things can be said for the visual grammar and iconography of advertising, cinema and architecture. 

Here are a couple of physical examples to show how it can be useful. All leptons (ie electrons) are specified by charge, mass and spin. All Black Holes similarly are specified by Mass, Charge and Angular Momentum. 

So, we can say meaning is both in Subjects and between Subjects. And then of course we have the very difficult question of what is the origin of Subjecivity; which pours both light and darkness on what constitutes meaning in the world. 

A measurement, in a general sense, can be thought of observation: I observe your height or weight; or the exact colour of the sky in an unclouded night and the number of stars. Now, there is a key on a table which I pick up in my left hand, and hide it in my palm with my fingers clenched in a fist; I ask you to observe it; so you look at my hand, and then I open my fist - you observe the key - and then I close my hand briefly, and open it again - and again you see the key. This much is expected; from moment to moment the key in my hand is at it is; but this is not inevitable or indeed neccessary. Say, in my right hand I pick up some plasticine; it is formless - without shape; and when I open my fist, I quickly shape it into a sphere; and then when I close it, I turn it back into some shapeless and formless piece of plasticine; and again when Inopen my fist - so you can observe what is in my hand, I quickly shape it into a cube and so on. This notion is called Value-Definiteness (VD) and is a key input into the Kochen-Specker Theorem; the first example above affirms it, and the second denies it. Aristotle would say, that for the second example, some thing - some value comes to be and ceases to be - condenses and rarifies; and this appears to be his understanding of things in the small; for example, in Physics VII.5, he writes: 

Hinduism should be considered a loose collection of religions who have certain family resemblances; rather than say something like Christianity which has a God, Jesus and the Bible in common despite the many theological differences between varying divisions. There is a polytheistic side to Hinduism and a monotheistic side to it to - which is best displayed in the Upanishads, and was revived in Bengal as the Brahmo Samaj when India was under British rule - one could argue it was the imported Christianity that reawakened this idea in Bengal. Brahman is described in the Isha Upanishad 

Yes, it does contradict itself. But that doesn't make it any less useful as a philosophical position as many nihilists will tell you. Nihilism may be better understood as an aesthetic rather than a properly mature philosophical position (which explains its singular attraction to certain kitted out in black adolescents). Consistency is not everything. After all the Liars Paradox contradicts itself yet Godel was able to spin out a major innovation in mathematical practise in the 20th century, or as Nietszche (portentiously) put it - 'very well, I contradict myself'. However all of the above is probably a banalisation of the nihilistic proposal; a modern exponent of this tendency is Ray Brassier. In Nihil Unbound: Enlightenment and Extinction he makes a mature and considered defence of this position. In this interview he says: 

I'm not sure just how true this is; Badiou explicitly mentions love as one of his four truth-procedures and his philosophy is densely mathematical. Psychoanalysis has been an explicit site for discussing sexuality - the Oedipus and Electra complex, the incest taboo; and again later with Lacan. I'd also take the broad view, as does Badiou that philosophy builds on a wide substrate of all the liberal arts and muses. Then one need only note that poetry, tragedy, music, painting and literature quite thoroughly explores the many different variations of human sexuality in many, many different settings. There's little point in thinking thought, when the foundations aren't there - though quite often it seems they aren't. As to why religions explicitly speaks of don'ts rather than do: I'd probably locate this in Mary Douglas thesis of Purity and Danger. 

In the Abrahamic religions it is explicitly recognised that Human Beings are endowed with free-will, the possibility & ability to choose between right and wrong. It is also recognised that God is all-powerful and all-knowledgeable amongst many other things. That these claims look contradictory, to our minds, doesn't negate them; it means only that the principle of consistency is held more dearly than any other value. One might point to the development of paraconsistent-logics that explicitly acknowledges irreducibly conflicting notions and accounts of what is true in the whole domain of what can be construed as knowledge. It shows that abandoning the criteria of global consistency does not neccessarily lead to trivialisation; instead what we have is local consistency. 

The second statement, is simply a restatement of the first: such capacity must refer to the capacity of reason, which is rational - by the usual understanding of what reason and reasoning means; and by stating that it is universal we come back to the first statement. But this, I think, is not what you mean; it seems that you are arguing why should mental activity which is shared by all thinking beings, be rational for all such beings, and not only now and then, but at all times. In a sense, it is a principle or an axiom that Kant is stating, that can be critiqued as you are doing, but which one accepts to see where he is going in his overall argument. One might justify it, by saying were we to understand every thought a rational being has thought, and every desire he has felt, and every sensation that he has experienced then we can understand, or make sense of why and how he acts. 

I'm not overly familiar with Heideggers thought, however a review of his Basic Concepts of Aristotelian Philosophy states that 

Reinhard cardinals are the largest cardinals yet defined that are consistent with ZF. This suggests that there are large cardinals that are inconsistent with ZF - are there in fact any? 

Is this a valid counter-example (perhaps with some semantic or syntactic re-jigging)? And does it exemplify what can go wrong in asserting the above axiom? 

Its an obvious observation that we know the past, and in an idealised situation we could know all of the past; however we can never know the future, empirically or in any idealised situation: it has yet to be experienced. I've seen this as one explanation for the (thermodynamic) arrow of time; but is this in fact a tautology? note What I understand by the thermodynamic arrow of time is that it points from positions of low entropy to higher; it's likely to be more complex than this, but I don't want to go into that here. When I say 'know' it's shorthand for measurement.
