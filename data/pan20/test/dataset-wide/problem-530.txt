Assuming you have room to hang the bike vertically by the rear wheel, it's pretty easy to assemble what you need from parts at the hardware store. Look for a cushioned hanger to put the rear wheel in. Then Google pipe hangers to find something to attach the hanger above to the pipe. You could also look for a coated S hook for the bike wheel. 

A trained cyclist can definitely ride farther and faster on a road bike than on a hybrid bike, based solely on wind resistance and bicycle fit. However, the speeds you list are completely unrealistic. Bike speeds are based primarily on the rider. Other major considerations include the route and the physical shape you want to arrive in. A 30 mile commute means you are riding 15 miles in each direction. I know a lot of people who bicycle commute this distance every day. They are all in excellent physical shape and ride at least 2,000 miles a year. (3,218 kilometers) Assuming: 

If you had a problem getting out of your SPD pedals, the pedal release tension was probably misset. If you are looking for clipless pedals, the SPD type is popular and the shoes are pretty easy to walk in. The Xpedo Mountain Force Magnesium/CroMo Clipless Pedals MF-4B are: 

How many days long is your ride? How sunny will it be and how much time will you have to do a solar charge? How many devices you need to charge. 

You have some contradictions in your requirements that are physically impossible. A light that is bright enough to ride by on a dark road requires a large amount of electricity to run, even with efficient LEDs as a light source. Even rechargable AA batteries can not output enough current to drive a bright light for 3 - 4 hours. I use a 3 Mode LED Bike Light. It consists of a light unit that uses rubber o-rings to attach to your handle bars. You can pop it off in a second. The power supply is a set of 4 rechargable 18650 batteries in a small nylon pack with a velcro strap. This straps anywhere on your bike frame. This light puts out around 900 lumens of light, basically the equivalent of a 75 watt light bulb. You also get a charger and the batteries last 3 - 4 hours at full power. This light runs around $45 - $55 when purchased straight from the site. Double that if purchased in the US on line, or triple it if purchased from a bike shop. The 3 modes are full power, half power, flash, and off. Finally, the amount of light you need (in lumens) depends on how dark the area is that you are riding in and how fast you are going. If you ride at 10 mph, you are traveling 14.7 feet every second. Realistically you need about 2 full seconds to detect, react, and avoid something, which means at 10 mph your light needs to illuminate 30 feet ahead of you. At 15 mph, you need to illuminate 45 feet ahead of you. At 20 mph this moves to 60 feet. Illuminating 60 full feet of road requires about 1,000 lumens. 

I have actually used both 2 different sized solar panels and a lithium backup battery on Ragbrai. Whether any of these will work for you depends on: 

Changing the tire yourself is fairly easy. See: Changing a bike tire Use your spare tube so you don't have to take the time to patch a tube. You might also want to include: 

It's a 0.9 lb bike lock made from Titanium. They cost $99 and come with a water bottle cage mount as shown. TiGrÂ® mini Bike Lock enter link description here 

You can weld titanium (but you need an inert gas shield to prevent O2 & N2 absorption while the material cools). Seam and weld cracks are relatively easy to fix. (But still pricey.) A stress crack may not be repairable at all, and I'm not sure I would trust it in any case on the BB. So without anymore information, I would say you have a crashed frame with frame failure. It is in the worst possible place. A repair will be expensive and may not even be possible. The repair was also not covered under the frames original warranty. After looking at the crack again, there is another possibility. When you weld titanium you have to shield the metal with an inert gas as it cools. Otherwise it can absorb O2 or N2 from the air. If the titanium absorbs either gas it becomes brittle and will crack over time. This crack is right near the BB at the seat of two major welds. The tube would have been very hot there and if it was not properly shielded by argon during welding and cooling, it could have absorbed air during that period. That effectively wrecks the titanium. This type of problem can not be fixed. (It should have been covered under warranty though.) Sounds like a good frame to avoid no matter how cheap the price. 

I have run over chipmunks 4 or 5 times, and hit deer twice in my rides on country bike trails. The deer caused the crashes both times, but neither I, the deer, or my bike was hurt. In both deer crashes I had some time (but not enough) to brake. Both deer crashes happened during the day. I'm very wary of deer now- they are incredibly stupid and simply don't understand bikes. When I see one I slow down and stop if it crosses the trail in front of me. (They virtually always travel in groups of 2 or more- see one and look out for the ones you don't see.) 

I'm a ride leader for group rides held in Chicago. I cover hand and verbal signals before every ride. But most of these signals only apply to group rides. We use hand & verbal signals for: 

I had the exact same problem a number of years ago. My physician prescribed muscle relaxants and told me to give up cycling. Instead, I went to an introductory session at a sports medicine clinic (it cost about $50). Brought my normal shoes and my cycling shoes. The did some simple tests on my feet and measured my arches. They then spent 45 minutes lecturing me on how to buy proper fitting shoes for my feet, and what type and size inserts I needed in my cycling shoes. Turns out my daily footwear was completely inappropriate and it was aggravated by the cycling shoes. With proper shoes and the right size inserts glued into my cycling shoes the problem was solved in less than a week. 

Unless you can find solid rubber tires for your bike, there really is no such thing as a puncture proof tire. You can get tires that are more resistant to puncture, but they can and will still go flat- just not as often. Why do you need a bike shop to fix a flat tire? You can easily do it yourself. All you need is a small saddle bag for tools and: 

For solar charging. The first lesson is you can not charge your device with a solar panel while you are riding. Solar panels need to be pointed directly at the sun to provide any kind of real power. The little solar chargers you see advertised are utterly useless. They might charge a phone if they were pointed directly at the sun for an entire day (15 hours). The larger solar charger I have is 14" x 12" with an adjustable mount so you can keep it aimed at the sun. I could recharge my phone (when off) in 4 - 5 hours. Small charger (useless) 10 watt panel (works) What worked the best was a large backup battery. They are not physically large- just large capacity. (15,000mAh or more). I used this for an entire Ragbrai. It charged my phone once a day for 9 days with power to spare. Note you turn your phone off at night, plug it into the charger, and the charger automatically turns off when the phone is charged. The phone saves power by being off all night. Wake up, turn the phone on and it's good for the entire day and evening. Sample 15,000mAh battery You can fly with these batteries in your luggage and probably in your carry on luggage. But the TSA often makes up its own rules on the fly and might decide to confiscate one in your carry on. I would keep it in checked bags. TSA rules Note that it takes about 2 full days to charge one of these batteries. You should probably test charging all your devices at home to see whether you can make it on your trip. You also need to remember that your battery is just as dangerous as an equivalent sized container of gasoline. You do not want to puncture it or expose it to high heat. If all that information is confusing, I only take my backup battery on Ragbrai now.
