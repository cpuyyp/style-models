The main part of this is the phrasing used. Nobody has any issue that you were offered and accepted redundancy (ie offered money to quit) but that "accepted redundancy" sounds a lot better than "asked to leave", as the latter suggests they were not happy with you and told you to go away. So, it simple to tell the truth in an interview, but when writing down the information simply state the reason for leaving is that you were offered redundancy. You can use it as a positive message, partly that you are looking because you no longer have a job through no fault of your own, but also because you consider it a great opportunity to work elsewhere and pick up new working practices. You don't even need to mention that they offered you some temporary work, its irrelevant to a career more and could only confuse matters. Oh, and never criticise your previous company, even letting you go can be a positive as it means they are managing their finances properly even if it means losing a valuable member of staff. 

Maybe you have a problem with the creative aspect of the job? Sitting down coding for 8 hours a day suggests a pure development role, but as with all software (particularly that written by devs writing code 8 hours a day every day) there are bugs and lots of support issues that need sorting out. A support engineer role still requires coding, but also a fair amount of investigation, analysis and customer feedback skills. These can make a boring job coding away into something much more involving, and once you solve problems, very satisfying. In addition, you're often not writing "new" code but fixing existing code. this can take away a lot of the 'paralysis' that some people dislike when thinking about how to make something new. Many devs think support is a poor choice, but I disagree - fixing the crappy code the devs create is a much more guided role. So, maybe ask to move or work more on support issues. And BTW, a PM role is awful. It may sound glamorous and easy but its thankless, boring and sometimes demeaning. All those gannt charts and spreadsheets... yuk. 

It happens more often than you think - for many places the only reason they appear prepared is because you're the 3rd or 4th interviewee and they're going through the exact same questions and motions they asked the other guys! Interviewers, especially technical ones, are busy with their day jobs. They're you, but asked to go interview a bunch of guys who are coming for interview as well. Oh and please get that code finished/server fixed/problem solved for the deadline. Even management have plenty of other things to do that do not involve getting an interview prepared. So what you do is not to assume the company or interviewer is incompetent, instead engage with them. This is your future colleague after all, and if you give him as much help in the interview as you can, that is only going to look good for you. I've done lots of interviewing so I like to think I know what I'm doing now, but my first time... my manager was out one day (disappeared off to a exhibition with the networks manager), and the receptionist turned up to our team and after asking where John was, said "OK so who's going to do his interview? The guy's in reception right now". (To make it worse, John had arranged 4 interviews that day...). How prepared do you think I was :-) (myself and a colleague replayed interviews we'd been to so I think we did very well considering, and hence got all the future interview gigs from them on). Interviews are not about being some perfect session of formal questioning, psychology and negotiation. There's 2 ordinary guys having a chat to see if you'd fit into their team and aren't a scammer trying to get a job with no relevant skills. That's it. So help the poor guy out, and help yourself in the process. and no coding questions... man, you had it so easy, all you had to do was talk a bit and show what a great, friendly, helpful team guy you are! 

Yes, wait until you have closer connections with them. Frankly, LinkenIn is pretty useless as a social network except when you're between jobs, and there's no reason why you shouldn't forget about it until then. I tend to connect with colleagues when I've either just left a place, or if I get close to them as part of my work. Adding people just to have a bigger network is no better than people with thousands of facebook friends. 

The easiest answer is simple: if you've had your CV sent to a company but not had an interview arranged, then often you don't even know who the company is - as many recruiting agents won't tell you. Hell, for many job adverts the company doesn't even exist, they exist only to harvest your CV to the recruiter. Once you've had an interview arranged, then it doesn't matter - the competing agent cannot 'steal' you from the original. You can say the name, or you can say "I don't know yet, I'm still waiting to hear back from the agent". Also, note that often the agent will be interested not because they are going to try to recruit you to that company, but because they might not know that company is recruiting - and once they do know, they will be contacting their HR to offer competing candidates. But again, this still doesn't matter if you've got an interview arranged - if you get it, good, but if not, the company will have more candidates to choose from. 

You're heard "buy a shredder". Buy one. Good ones are not as noisy as you think, I have one I blagged off ebay and while it would make a noise that would disturb someone if they were working, you'd have to really go shred a thousand pages, one at a time, before they set on you. Besides, you can put it out of the way or use it out of hours. Bear in mind that burning can be not as reliable as you think: if you are not taking care to burn each page slowly, and try to burn a lot of pages at once in a metal can, you will find that much of the paper does not burn away - it will float away in the hot thermal draughts, it will leave behind half-burned pages. But the best way to get rid of paper is water. Water will easily turn a book into a pulpy mass of fibres given a bit of time and some stirring. This is probably the best approach, particularly if you've shredded the pages first (or even just torn them into strips). Put them in a bucket and wait for them to fall apart. Bonus if you make new paper out of the mulch! 

In a sense you're going to have to convince management that the changes you need are essential to get things running. You're probably also going to need to handle politics, and compliance, and so on. Its not going to be easy. 

The CV's meant to get your foot in the door. Personally I put the month of award once its completed (and leave out the dates when it was in progress) , but you could always put May 2010 - June 2014 (Awarded Aug 2014). When the exact details matter, you probably will already be interviewing, and can clear minor stuff like that easily. No one's going to bother if you're a little off, especially where such delays are standard 

Its probably worth looking at both sides of the issue "We follow some ISO standard for security, specifically 27001, from what I can gather" These are generally a pain in the ass requiring much box ticking. Your IT department is probably doing what they are supposed to be doing, and getting in their face about it isn't going to help any. In fact, even looking at the wikipedia makes it clear that its pedantic by design, and I thankfully am not reading through the whole thing for an answer. Spare a thought for the IT guys who actually have to read, understand and implement this! If you're going to have to ask for changes, consider that the decision is probably made higher up, and possibly by less technical folk. You're probably going to have to work out the right person and way to ask, and its as much a political as much as a technical decision. One possibility would be to see if you can get an isolated development/test environment, airgapped from the main network (but once again, this depends on your corporate standards.) Some of these requests may be more feasable than others. 

I'm a forward caste dude. And outside what I eat, and who I'd eventually potentially marry, it has no affect on the real world. I'm a semi practicing bramin. I'm pretty sure there's folks who're probably closer to their own dharma, or a better bramin than me by faith, not birth, and there's a few folks who give us a bad name, and don't even do the basics. Its nothing more than a label in most aspects of life, and a faded one to boot. And well your issues have nothing to do with the caste system. Its plain old corruption and nepotism. Your workplace is toxic and these people use this as an excuse. 

This is simply unacceptable. In most companies this should be reported to HR, or suitable authorities. I'd like to use a certain set of 3 4 letter words to describe this, but I'll settle for "This is unacceptable". If there isn't such a system, don't let them get to you. Be firm, let them know this is unacceptable politely, and don't loose your cool. 

Make sure that all the paperwork you'd need to get your next job is in order, check to see if your manager would give you a positive reference for your next job, update your resume, and start looking for your next job. The moment you're asked to leave, there's no real reason to have any sort of loyalty or attachment to your last company. They've chosen to cut you loose (and the end of the year's not the best time for that). At this point there's nothing left for you at your old company. You can always prove yourself at your next job. 

Typically, no, unless they specifically ask for it. As for previous experience in a different field, I'd consider it for two reasons. Firstly if there's a gap in your employment history. Secondly, if you can talk about it in an interview. The average tech resume is a page. At the end of the day, your qualifications matter more than the breakdown of your grades. Did you pass with honours? Add that. Did you get a D in one module and a gold star in spelling? Less interesting. Consider as well that you're writing a resume for someone who's going to be skimming over it, and might not be technical. Keep it simple, focus on qualifications and skills, and you ought to have an easier time. As for grades? I tend to bring a copy of them to an interview on a first interview in case anyone asks. I found that its more for "does he have the degree" than "what's his grades" in many cases. 

Its undo pressure that keeps you from doing your job. Treat it exactly as someone who would do it for a brother, cousin or child. If you can do it, do it anyway. If you have a superior who actually values the work you do, let him know this is happening 

check if your office building allows it. Ours was in a residencial building but most local office spaces don't allow this. It really depends on the dog - if its a dog that sleeps much of the time, and just needs people present its a better office dog in many cases than one that's going to keep demanding people play fetch with it. There were games of fetch played over downtime sometimes tho. Have a 'dog/people' safe space when needed - our office dog was enthusiastic about greeting people, and sounded much larger than he was. We had a bed in the conference room or the director's office for when we needed to keep him out of the way cause someone was afraid of dogs and/or we had a delivery and wanted to avoid crushed dog. If possible, the intern might have a spare/old pen that might work well. Dogs are awesome stress relief. Its a lot easier if the dog's 'timings' work around work times - we parked the dog around lunch and after work, which worked well. Years after retirement, the dog still does his business at the same times ;). Doing it outside is essential - for obvious reasons. Yes, we're all adults here and I'm talking poo.
