When I try from Windows 2012, I get an error about the certificate and if I choose to ignore, it connects normally: 

I sent a client a CSR a few months ago and now they finally sent me back the CA response. However, there are multiple Windows 2008R2 servers and I don't remember which one I used to generate the CSR and, therefore, I don't know which server contains the private key. How can I find out? Update On the server I suspected was the right one, I went into the certificate management for the local computer using the MMC (certmgr.msc) and under Certificates (Local Computer) > Certificate Enrollment Requests > Certificates, I found the private key associated with the CSR. My problem is, however, that when I try to complete the request from IIS (where I created the CSR) it doesn't associate it with this private key. I tried certreq -accept -machine "c:\cert.crt" but I get this error: 

Why is it still failing if I'm only using strong ciphers and can't find any overriding configuration anywhere? 

I have an IIS hosted ASP.Net site which is experiencing timeouts. I would like to be able to monitor it from every angle but I'm not sure where to start with configuring PerfMon counters. Does anyone know of a sort of template for PerfMon for monitoring ASP.Net applications on Windows 2012? 

We have an Apache 2.2.3 server with OpenSSL 0.9.8e-fips-rhel5. I am running the following SSL configuration in my VirtualHost. I can't find any other config files with any SSL directives whatsoever. 

I assigned an instance-level IP address to my Azure VM. I then configured the SSH "endpoint" from the Azure portal and defined a deny-all policy. However, this policy seems to only affect the cloud service VIP, and not the instance-level IP which is completely open to the internet. I am now seeing Chinese hackers trying to brute force the system on this IP. How can I apply my deny-all policy to the instance-level IP? 

We have a website hosted in IIS 7.5, say www.example.com, and we purchased an SSL cert for it. Now we would like to implement SAML2.0 in some of the responses. Is it possible to use our existing SSL cert to encrypt the SAML responses? 

I have a web app which is load balanced across two Windows 2012 R2 servers with IIS 8.5. Sometimes, it seems the IIS process gets "stuck" on one web server but there is no indication of an issue anywhere - not in our app logs or the Windows event log. The only thing which fixes it is an iisreset. And the only way we know it's happening is because the site fails to load intermittently and we get email alerts. How can I catch these events without relying on monitoring alerts? I want to configure an HTTP probe on the load balancer but that means the web server will be silently removed from rotation and we'll have no idea that a web server has an issue. 

Turns out the issue was that I forgot to include the NameVirtualHost *:443 directive in the virtual hosts config file, as well as adding the *:443 binding to the existing virtual host. 

I have Postfix 6.6. When I send a newsletter blast from our SMTP server, many of the recipient emails are not valid and so the spam gateway on the receiving mail server (different server) gets inundated with bounce messages. I would like to mitigate this by configuring recipient verification, but I can't find a really informative guide on best practices and configuration steps. How do I set it up? Also, can I have it build a list of invalid recipients so make future lookups quicker, and to be able to use it to clean out the newsletter recipient list? Also, can anyone with experience provide some of the disadvantages of doing this (aside from slowing down the mailing)? BTW from what I understand, to enable basic recipient verification, I just add this to main.cf. Is this correct? smtpd_recipient_restrictions = permit_mynetworks, reject_unauth_destination, reject_unverified_recipient 

This is a new Windows 2016 server. We have three users on it and two of them are able to login without issue. The third one, no matter what we've tried (except rebooting; trying to avoid that) is not able to login. He keeps getting this error: 

When I run this cmdlet from Ex2k7 shell, it replies correctly with Ex2k7 and Ex2k10 servers. I haven't been able to figure out what to do about this. Can anyone point me in the right direction? 

Had to get on the DPM server, unjoin domain, delete computer object from AD, rejoin domain on DPM server, add new DPM server object to "Distributed COM Users" AD group. Next, follow directions to install the agents manually: $URL$ Do not skip the step about running SetDPMServer.exe! 

As you can see, the reply seems to be coming from an empty IP (0.0.0.0:67) and so I assume this is the problem. Am I correct? If so, what could be the cause? Thanks! 

I need to redirect this: $URL$ to this: $URL$ But IIS7 URL rewrite does not recognize the question mark, even if I try to escape it. Is this possible? 

What can I do to find out why this thing keeps reappearing, and why it's ending up in the root store every time??? 

However, I see nothing in the general logs. If I enter a bad password, that DOES show up in the logs though. But nothing about aborted connections: 

Please give me your view on this question based on your own experiences. I am trying to determine if I should host our Exchange server in our data center (which host our websites with ~99% uptime). Currently it is hosted at our dev office, in a 2003 domain environment. The problem here is that there are power outages like once a month and it isn't reliable enough. If we will host ourselves, we are thinking of installing a secondary 2008 DC along with Exchange, with a tunnel to the office. We want to avoid a case where the power will go out on the primary DC and bring down the Exchange service at the data center. Is that possible? If we choose Office 365, will we need to change the MX record for the entire domain? If so, we'll have about 80 different Outlooks to reconfigure and somehow import the mail into Office 365, correct? Thanks! 

What can I do? I have other VM's in Azure with the same specs and running many more, and more complex, sites, and they have zero crashes. EDIT This is what the memory looks like within one minute of starting up MariaDB: 

If I want to get a copy of SQL 2012 Web Edition, do I have to go through a hosting provider such as Rackspace? What about if I am in the MS Select program and a Volume Licensing account? How is it licensed? Is it also a per core license? Also, can I restore a database from an SQL 2012 Development Edition instance to an SQL 2012 Web Edition instance? 

We have on Exchange 2010 server in our domain, on-premises. We added a second Exchange 2010 server in our cloud environment, which is also part of our domain and connected with a site-to-site VPN tunnel. The goal was to migrate mailboxes to the new server and then decommission the old one. After adding the second server, I made sure it was not associated with the Internet send connector. However, mail to external recipients continues to go undelivered because it is being routed through this new server, which isn't configured correctly. As a result, we end up getting delivery delayed notices on all emails to external users. How do I keep this new server online and able to accept mailbox migrations, while making sure it is not being used for delivering any mail? 

When I check the event viewer on the SQL server, I see the following two errors grouped together multiple times, for each corresponding failed login attempt: 

I have MySQL Server version: 5.0.77-log Source distribution on a RHEL6 server. I need to reinstall it on a second RHEL6 server to set up a testing environment but I cannot find where to download this exact version. Thanks! 

For me what fixed it was to go into the Office 365-linked Azure AD via portal.azure.com, and from there I changed the problematic user's username to the desired one. After that, I went back to Office 365 Admin and again updated the user's login. This time it worked right away. 

My Windows 2003 R2 SP2 server crashes about once a month. I analyzed the crash dump but can't really figure out what it means. Any help is appreciated.... 

We use SolarWinds SAM software to monitor servers and applications. We started using it to monitor our SQL servers through the performance counters. We started getting alerts two to three times daily saying that the "Total Server Memory" and "User Connections" counters were too high. We get these alerts at the same time for all three servers...almost like it's synchronized to go off at the same time. The alerts reset maybe 3 minutes after going off. I haven't been able to find any reason why this is happening. Any idea what may be causing this, or how to track down the cause? The queries used to pull the data are as follows. For "User Connections": 

Trying to promote a Windows 2012 server to DC in a 2008 domain and after passing all prerequisites and beginning the process, I get an error stating: 

I created a VM using the standard CentOS 7.1 image in the Azure gallery. I generalized it and captured it as a base image for future deployments. However, once I spin up a VM using this image, the provisioning just runs for over an hour before finally displaying the status and the new portal notifies me that it failed to create the VM. However, I'm still able to connect to the VM and everything works. Why does it say that the provisioning has timed out? I tried shutting it down from the portal and restarting it but it had no effect. I tried checking and unchecking the option that says the agent extension is already installed. I changed the VM size. Nothing works. 

I am pretty familiar with IIS and URL Rewrite but I just got a task which stumped me. I need to check each request for the presence of the X-Forwarded-For HTTP header and, depending on its presence, redirect the request. How can I check for this header? 

While learning how to use my Cisco 851W router, I downloaded a configuration script with preconfigured settings. I ran this from the router and now I can no longer boot up and get to a command prompt. I have tried holding the reset button while turning the router back on, but I guess there is no valid file in flash because it continues loading the config from NVRAM. Here is the output during bootup. At the last line, it freezes and I can no longer do anything. Any ideas how to recover from this? 

Fixed it by forcing it to append a dot '.' as a DNS suffix. Unfortunately this is a hassle to apply on each VM so I'm still waiting for other answers before accepting my own. 

I restarted mysqld after making those changes and then tested by telnetting to the server on port 3306 and then closing the connection. After doing so, I run: 

I cloned our current TFS 2012 server so that I could test an upgrade to TFS 2015. I kept the VM offline while upgrading the pre-requisites and also renamed it so there wouldn't be any DNS issues with the existing server, which is still live. I was hoping to do the upgrade while offline but it cannot proceed without communicating with the DC's. Therefore, I would like to know if there's any risk in putting the VM online during the upgrade, considering there is an existing TFS installation in the same AD domain. Will it try making any changes in AD, for example, which would try pointing clients to the new environment? Thank you for your input. 

I know there is a bug in MySQL 5.0 which prevents aborted connections from being logged in the error log ($URL$ However, aborted connections should still be logged in the general query log. When I tried configuring the logging for this, I still don't see aborted connections in the general log. Here is the part I configured from my.cnf: 

I ended up finding that Putty was not allowing me to see the login screen. I installed SecureCRT and the login prompt showed up right away. Weird since I'm using the exact same settings on both programs (9600 baud, 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit). 

What worked for me finally was to logon as a different admin user and start Task Manager, switch to the Users tab, right-click the problem user and select "Connect". 

I'm working on Redhat6 with Apache2. I have a wildcard cert for *.example.com installed on my IIS7 server. I exported it to PFX, moved it to the Linux server, converted it to key and cert with openssl. I configured the VirtualHost with SSL as follows before restarting the httpd service: 

We currently have a Windows 2003 domain and an Exchange 2007 server integrated into the domain. Since the power goes out often in the current building, we would like to move the Exchange server to the cloud (Office 365) and I am wondering what is the best way to do this.. First, is it possible to connect the Office 365 Exchange server to our DC using a tunnel? If so, my concern is that if the power goes out again, the DC will be down and therefore the Exchange will go down as well. Therefore, is it possible to set up a secondary DC in the cloud that will sync with our current DC? My last question is, would it be possible to set up the secondary DC as a Windows 2008 R2 server, given that our current DC is Windows 2003?
