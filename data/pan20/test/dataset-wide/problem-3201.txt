When the shovel became standard issue for infantry between World Wars 1 and 2. I don't believe swords were ever "standard issue" for infantry but certainly starting with Napoleon bayonets were. German infantry did so well against all other counterparts in North Africa because Erwin Rommel made sure all soldiers had a shovel, knew how to use it and in fact did use it. Russian interior ministry forces are famous for their use of shovels and the US military is infamous for having great shovels but failing to use them. 

Rudolf Hess is the best example I can think of. He transcribed all of Hitler's lunacy and embarrassed Hitler himself with his over the top introductions and constant haranguing of "dark forces working against us." He was an interesting character study...lived longer than any of the other True Believers. That does imply a certain form of wisdom actually...something the tens of millions who died for and fighting against "Hitlerism" simply failed to grasp. I'm not a big fan of Livy either...he re-wrote most of Polybius's History on the Punic Wars from a very biased Roman point of view 200 years later. It is interesting to view the two Histories side by side. 

The only thing I would add to the comments above would be Hermann Goring's very frank testimony at the Nuremberg Trials where he stated his belief and the fact that he had argued for an attack on Gibraltar as opposed to Russia in June, 1941. It should be remembered that the only extant Nation and People was at War with after the Fall of France was Great Britain and that the German Air Force had failed to defeat Great Britain in the year between June, 1940 and June, 1941. That meant any invasion of Russia would mean fighting two adversaries instead of one. Neither Spain nor Portugal threatened Germany in any way nor as with Napoleon could Great Britain "bleed the Empire white" so to speak. Portugal was a hotbed of intrigue during World War 2 as well...a place second only to Switzerland as far as illicit money transfers took place. After the rather remarkable success of the Wehrmacht's invasion of the Balkans just prior to Barbarossa it is rather odd they didn't follow it up with an attack on Gibraltar. Germany didn't need 300,000 men to "hold down Norway" either so it is interesting to posit an attack on Gibraltar being a prelude to an attack on Great Britain. We'll never know because everyone blamed Goring and then he got executed. When you look at some of the Nazi's who didn't get executed Goring does in fact stand out. It's not like the German Air Force was guarding the Concentration Camps and then bombing the prison...err, "detainees"... if they got out of line. That sure wasn't true of the OKW or the German Navy. " Dr Mengele" doesn't sound like a very German name either so I do wonder just how "neutral" Spain and Portugal truly were too. Only Great Britain defended Malta...from beginning to end I might add. 

Nope. There isn't. Since there is no competition with "China from China" the best way to value ceramics both yesterday and today is by weight(lighter the better), color (blues and bright whites in contrast), hardness (thin but strong), form (simple plate or a vase for holding water implying enormous strength), etc The only way a laymen might pick up a fraud from "the real deal" is by detecting the difference between hand thrown and machine made as hand made will have readily apparent imperfections whereas that which is machine made and hardened...and "glossed"(spray painted instead of glazed) are the only dead giveaways I am aware of. 

Mussolini I believe was a World War I vet and a strong believer in the "stab in the back" hypothesis when it came to France and Britain and very much an inspiration to Hitler personally. "Fascismo" was an Italian creation although when "translated" in first Austrian and then German it took on a whole new meaning. Italy entered World War 1 and suffered terrible losses...but not under any false pretense. They expected advantages for so siding with the Allies at the expense of Austria. Germany naturally sided with Austria in World War I but was also pre-emptively attacked by the Russians...so the Germans really did have a grudge coming out of World War I unlike Italy. So did Austria of course which wasn't a threat to anyone going into the outbreak of World War I. So to keep it brief in my view Mussolini was the "idea factory" for a lot of really angry people...angry people who could in fact implement those ideas to truly awesome and terrifying effect. That included a formal invasion of Italy and making that country a battlefield in World War 2. Italy did achieve some territorial gains at the expense of Austria due to their involvement in World War 2. That still meant of course that Austria has a grudge against Italy...true even today. Austria has a kind of "super grudge" against Western Europe even today actually. 

Well....first West Berlin was surrounded by...drum roll please....GERMANS. So there were no shortage of sympathizers. Berlin also became a major media center...if not the major media...for all of Europe. The social scene was pretty wacky...but certainly better than New York City in the 70's. And simply put Russia was spending trillions in Rubles they did not have to support "their Capital of Berlin." In the end the whole non sensical mess collapsed and Berlin and the bulk of Germany was reunited with its Capital in Berlin. Very little of the Wall remains. 

Kept the USA out of War with Imperial Germany over Venezuela, stupendous economic growth, trust busting "malefactors of great wealth", set up the National Park System, built the first of what would become massive Dams out West, signed off on " Plan Orange"...the only case for American military action outside of its territory...which created a War Plan should Japan attack the United States, negotiated the end of the Russo-Japanese War, completed the Panama Canal, etc etc etc Cemented the North Eastern USA as "the Power" in the America's until the 1960's. 

The only historical connections that I know that exist starting with Ancient Greece and moving forward to the 18 hundreds are through Egypt pushing upriver (South) through the Nile and then through sporadic contact with the Romans (who were the Nubians for example?) After that you have the Portuguese and West Africa but even then I know of little contact until King Leopold II of Belgium and the famous "connection" by British exlorers made between the Nile and the Belgian Congo (that there was no connection but two entirely separate and massive River systems.) From what I have read of Belgian Colonial history there were no "River Civilizations" (though certainly people) along the breadth and depth of the Belgian Congo. This would mean a basically uninhabited region bigger in size than all of Western Europe being discovered in the late 1800's. That is not true today obviously. 

I would imagine you would have to refer to the average height of the men who were around him...so in that context, say relative to his own or opposing Generals he might physically be seen as "short." He was never an imposing figure like say Loius XIVth was. But he did have his trademark hat...and he could ride a horse too so in that sense "he was above you"...and if you were going up against him personally in Battle you would know it as Spain found out...and the English too. And the Germans...and the Austrians...and Northern Italy...and the Egyptians...not the Russians so much... 

So most people look to movies when they think of War but this is the greatest lie ever told. Most War is simply the act of nothing getting done and even less happening (The Front.) World War 1 in the West is the textbook example of this...with the Battle of Virginia during the US Civil War an excellent precursor. It was quite common in the latter for Johnny Reb and a Yank who would take up sniping positions in trees and other assorted locations as skirmishers to strike up a conversation with another...literally of the most friendliest of terms save the handshake. This may sound odd for those brought up under the Manichean View of "Us versus the Terrorists" but Americans have a long History of yucking it up with the Enemy as our first Enemy claimed to be the very English we were fighting. So you can imagine all sorts of confusions as a result. This could never be true in World War 1 given the language and cultural differences...but the line was still the same....sometimes mere yards from one another. I would recommend googling a comparative study of the actual trenches themselves. You'll find very quickly German and Austrian trench systems were far better built and "organized" than those in the West. Such an advantage cannot be overstated. Even the French Army mutinied over offensive activity in their own country against assaulting German and Austrian trench positions outside of Paris. The reason for the "system" proceeded by the logic of Germany having to fight on two fronts simultaneously. The West was too strong...the East was attacking..just dig in in the West and deal with the issues in the East as that was where the the "means of War" would be gathered for the Axis Powers. 

He did famously say the day before one of History's greatest battles to his Generals "learn this land very well Generals for tomorrow there shall be a great battle here." Napoleon did this with extraordinary regularity. He seemed to know what his enemy would do before even his enemy did in a remarkable way. I do recommend googling YouTube on Napoleon 

My understanding of the Russian response to the 3rd Reich's "November Campaign" as I think it is known in German History was a shock at the speed with which Germany took "their half" (including Warsaw.) most historians believe this caused the Red Army to dramatically move up the time table for their "part." Whether or not the notable and bloodless success of the Red Army emboldened them to behave more aggressively towards the West is an interesting point of inquiry. The premeditated invasion of Finland was the end of the League of Nations as neither a feckless Britain or weak France came to the defense of what spelled the demise of the only organization left where the Peace of Europe could be discussed openly and harmoniously. To my knowledge nothing has appeared in the archives after the collapse of the USSR that corroborates an "accelerated time table thesis" as it relates to the Red Army towards the West at it related towards Germany which had a far from bloodless campaign against Poland in 1939 albeit a very brief one. Stalin did want the entire Polish people exterminated in the Russian sector however and not just stop at the Katyn Massacre...so clearly Stalin saw a threat coming from the West again. 

There is no serious Historian that does not put a minimum of 20 years to have happened "after the fact" on any subject before it can be seen as "historical in nature." Why is that? 

Greatest intelligence success of World War 2 was achieving the element of surprise against the Red Army. The Admiral Canaris was anti-Communist in the extreme...but anti Nazi too. I think diplomatic negotiations between the 3rd Reich and Britain occurred at the highest of levels...but the near totality of these discussions remain classified in the English side to this day. Hard to tell on the American side because we captured all of the diplomatic cables going back to Bismark. The other element is Naval intelligence..which fell into British hands at the end of the War...and again remains classified. There is a theory that Hitler himself was a kind of "useful idiot" for Great Britain...and there may be much more truth to this than we currently know. 

So I think what is most critical in understanding December 7th, 1941 is that Japan itself did NOT declare War on the United States but instead did knowingly launch a "sneak attack" on the US Navy and Army Air Forces on that day. There are those even at the time that the whole thing was a "contrivance" created by the Roosevelt Administration but the fact remains as FDR pointed out in his dramatic address that a "State of War now EXISTS" (emphasis mine) "between the United States and Japan." This did give pause to the 3rd Reich as indeed they were under no obligation to support a "sneak attack" and indeed had many reasons to oppose an outright Declaration of War on the USA given such a circumstance. That makes this a very valid question from an Historical point of view relating to any War but especially World War 2. I'm not sure there is any answer actually other than there were mutual declarations of War by the 3rd Reich and the USA against each other....which was great news for Russia and Great Britain....both of whom looked on the verge of defeat in the Winter of 1941. There was nothing that came out during the Nuremberg Trials that I am aware of either on this question...even though the Nazi "Secretary of State" Von Ribbentrop was one of the captured and accused and was directly questioned by the English Jurist on this matter. Interesting discussion. 

I can't think of a single one militarily. The last time I can think of any actual cooperation was under "Nunn/Lugar" which involved the deconstruction of the former Soviet Union's vast stockpiles of nuclear weapons. There are rumors that the USA and Russia are cooperating in Syria...but Russia's stated goal is to keep Assad in power whereas the USA has said it's goal is to have him deposed. Turkey is also a member of NATO whereas Russia most certainly is not. 

One piece of conjecture is that "Germans" invaded from Europe to the East joining up with the Mongolian Horde in the total annihilation of Baghdad. There is apparently much written in Islamic History about an "overland attack from the West" in conjunction with the Armies from the East as the reason for Baghdad's extermination. My understanding is that Polish Armies did engage the Mongols "for the defense of Europe" but were annihilated as well. As far as settlements go though the Golden Horde went no further than Crimea where they built a massive fortification to prevent any invaders from striking from the West. Those fortifications and the slave trade that was common in Crimea lasted for Centuries thereafter. 

Japan had "The East Asia co-prosperity zone" unlike the 3rd Reich which really did believe in all that Aryan Supremo stuff. I've travelled throughout East Asia but not Japan. I'm talking "hippie travel" too not 5 star hotels or Government employ and lived there for 6 months. The History is taught the way it is I think because this was truly an "honest War" with no quarter given by either side...so simply "bookending" does pretty much inform the average bloke. If you want to know what really happened the two must reads are War without Mercy and Eugene Sledge's epochal account of what it meant to be a Marine. (Wearing teeth around your neck, skulls for candleholders....that kind of thing.) Nimitz versus MacArthur and "divided command" is very worthy of research. My old Prof Richard Spector has written a lot on this...all of it wrong but still good reading. From the Japanese pov I'd say Godzilla...but like I said their whole History and Culture is truly a mystery to me. Neither Japan nor the USA wants to relive this War...and it was truly a fight to the death unlike any other so if you want to find out more imho you're on your own on this one.
