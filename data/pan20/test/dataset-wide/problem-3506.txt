Such a distribution can then be fed into ensemble modelling. So instead of using a single forecast of the future value of a currency pair, I could feed in the distribution to a monte carlo simulator or similar. It doesn't need to have the right expected value, nor a correct value for volatility (or any other moment). All that makes it essentially useless for trading. And that's a good thing, because no one of sound mind would give away a profitable forex forecaster: such a forecaster would immediately render itself obsolete as it entered common use. 

Those are all potential consequences of price controls. It would all depend on how the price controls were done, what measures were put in place alongside them, and all the context of the good itself. If the price is set at too high a level, excess supply may occur. If too low, excess demand may occur. If it's a good with an extremely limited market that is met under the price control, then no unexploited opportunities may exist. If potential demand is greater than the rate at which it can be retailed, then people may spend a lot of time waiting in line to acquire the good. And underground markets may emerge in any case. 

Because there is freedom of movement between provinces; and the language barrier is low. When international borders are involved, there is much less freedom of movement, and much greater potential for language barriers. So it's easier for labour to move between provinces if incentivised to do so by a change in relative taxation rates; than it is to move between countries. 

Is "autarky" the word you're looking for? That's been used to refer to a self-sufficient economy that does not need imports. As others have written, it's an ideological position that chooses to make a country worse off, and doesn't happen in reality, except for short periods in exceptional circumstances. 

In general, it is possible to find assets that earn a positive yield. There are still positive-yield low-risk bonds and savings accounts out there, for most currencies. Therefore, rational people should in general prefer these to a higher-risk asset which has zero yield. So, your quote is saying that the only way that rational people will choose to hold a zero-yield high-risk asset such as bitcoin, is if there is a significant chance that the asset will increase in value. There's no yield, so the only way to get a return is if the asset increases in value. If bitcoin doesn't do that, then no rational person will hold it. It's the same principle as with any other ponzi scheme: the only way that existing investors can get any return, is to draw in new investors, and take their money off them. 

The actively trading businesses with zero employees are therefore those businesses where the staff members are drawn exclusively from that group. That may cover most one-person outfits, perhaps some family firms, groups of self-employed people, and so on. These businesses are typically formed in that way as a response to particular regulations, usually tax rules. The answer is in the explanatory notes attached to that dataset, section 56, from where the above quote is taken. The explanatory notes are attached to that dataset to answer questions such as this. When you have questions about a particular dataset, the explanatory notes (which might also be called metadata, data descriptors, or similar), will usually have the answer, as they do in this case, and should be any enquirer's first place to look. 

These pollution costs are included within the broader definition of subsidy as used by the IMF, because these negative production externalities are costs incurred by production, that the producer itself does not directly bear. Thus, those costs are not reflected in prices, leading to market failure and an unfair competitive advantage, of the same kind and market impact as if they'd received a cash subsidy on their directly-incurred costs. The "Economics Help" site explains the issue 

One of the key requirements for a currency area to be successful is that there must be a sustainable political mandate to support fiscal transfers between regions, to provide the balancing mechanism that would otherwise have been performed by fluctuating currency rates between those regions. Another is that labour can move freely between regions. The Eurozone, it turns out, met neither of those requirements: Language barriers have impaired freedom of movement. And although Northern Europe was happy to reap the benefits of currency union during the good times, it has proven to be unwilling to make the fiscal transfers to the South during the bad times. Exacerbating this, Greek admission to the Euro zone was created on the back of some fraudulent accounting courtesy of Goldman Sachs. Based on the real numbers, Greece would never have been admitted. 

I don't think it's any more complicated than looking at the ratio of global oil consumption and global Gross Domestic Product. The OECD, World Bank, IMF and others produce estimates of each. There is some fuel-switching: for example, the world burns much less electricity from oil than it used to: in 1973 (the first oil crisis started around October that year) 251 million tonnes were used for electricity; by 2000, this had dropped to 110; by 2012, to 70 (table 7A on IV.81 of the IEA Electricity Information 2014). There's several decades of energy efficiency, kickstarted in large part by the oil shocks of the 1970s. The share of services (relative to physical goods) within global GDP has increased; IIRC services require much lower energy inputs than goods, on average, even though transport is one of the services (I'll check this and edit later - please nudge me in comments if I haven't after a week or so). The World Bank only gives services as a share of global GDP from 1990 onwards: this share grew from 60.7% in 1990 to 70.2% in 2011. The combination of energy efficiency and the increase in the share of services (relative to physical goods) within global GDP, means that energy consumption per unit of global GDP has fallen: J. Bradford DeLong gives global GDP at \$12 trillion for 1970 and \$41 trillion for 2000 (preferred measure, 1990 international dollars). The BP Statistical Review of World Energy 2014 gives 1970 energy consumption at 4.9 billion tonnes of oil equivalent (btoe) and 9.3 btoe for 2000. So energy per unit global GDP almost halved (44% reduction) over those thirty years 1970-2000. Understanding an individual country's changes are harder, because we then have to unpick whether oil intensity of GDP has dropped because of energy-efficiency & fuel-switching, or because oil-intensive goods are now imported rather than produced domestically: for further reading on this, see papers by John Barrett and by Dieter Helm. 

Use Bayesian regression. It's much more flexible on its assumptions, and much more powerful in its outputs. You'll find that you have to be much more explicit about your assumptions, and you'll have to quantify them. It's much harder work, and all the work you do, will be valuable. Normal regression makes it very easy for anyone to do really bad science. Bayesian regression makes it harder to do anything, but makes it much easier to do good science. 

Because although some goods have perfect inelasticity over some interval, they are not perfectly inelastic over the whole demand curve - over the rest of the curve, quantity and demand will be strictly inversely related. And the law of demand doesn't have a "strictly" in there. Price and quantity are inversely related, but not strictly so, which (in the mathematical sense) means that parts of the demand curve are allowed to be perfectly inelastic. 

Your intuition is correct: in cases of market failure when the price under-represents the marginal value to society as a whole (for example if positive externalities are present) then granting the subsidy would improve allocative efficiency. As long as the subsidy is not greater than the positive externality, then the only loss in that case arises from the overhead in managing the subsidy - the bureaucratic cost. This is typically less than the inefficiency resulting from the market failure, so society gets a net gain from the subsidy. The same thing applies with taxes and negative externalities. For the original work on this, see Pigou's seminal "The Economics of Welfare" (1924) 

There isn't such a value. I would hope that no one claims that there is. The statistical value of life is a (somewhat lazy) calculation of convenience. Lots of business case protocols need a value for anything that's going into the business case. Changing the probabilities of survival is an outcome of many interventions for which the decision-makers have insisted on business cases, so some method is needed to value these probabilities. One of the earliest ways to do this, back when relevant research was scarcer than it is today, and computational power was much more limited, was to assign a single value of life, which was calculated using methods that assumed a priori that there existed a single value of $X$ that was an adequate approximation for all values of $p$ that are sufficiently close to $0$. That method is still used today largely due to institutional inertia. 

Net exports aren't in and of themselves a bad thing; they should just be a transitory phenomenon. A prolonged export imbalance should just lead to an exchange rate adjustment which fixes the imbalance. Protectionism on the whole, in general, leaves all sides worse off. David Ricardo documented it very well; and it wouldn't surprise me if there were proverbs in all the major ancient civilisations to the same effect. There are exceptions: for example, infant industries typically need protection during their vulnerable early years, so that they can reach sufficient maturity that they can thrive under international competition. However, that's different to the general protectionism that does get proposed at times of deep slump - the Long Depression, the Great Depression, and the current (2008-now) slump: then, it's one of the (socially and economically) worst options, but does appeal to the masses when they're desperate for an "other" to blame, and for easy answers to complex questions. 

tl;dr: Energy is one of the worst ideas for a currency that anyone's had. It's not fungible, it's not a store of value, and has absolutely no scarcity. Let's look at the details. Commodity currencies are problematic jmbjera has listed core problems with the gold standard, and with commodity currencies generally: its supply is managed not by a democratically-elected government, but by one industry, so you remove a hugely useful tool from the policy-makers' toolbox; and you expose yourself to very high short-term volatility. But even amongst commodities, energy has unique issues that make it worse than useless as a currency. Energy is ubiquitous and bountiful There's absolutely enormous quantities of it lying around everywhere. One kilogramme of anything contains mind-boggling amounts of energy - $E=mc^2$, right? c, the speed of light, is huge. Squaring it makes it a lot bigger (when we're in SI units). $3\times10^8m/s$ squared becomes $9\times10^{16}$ - that's how many joules of energy in 1kg of matter. Any matter. Soil, platinum, flesh and blood, it doesn't matter, it's all the same amount of energy: 90 Petajoules; aka 25 Terawatt-hours. That's a few weeks worth of electricity supply in Britain. So an energy currency means one kilogramme of sand is equivalent value to sufficient electricity to power that G7 country for a few weeks. Additional energy arrives on Earth every second of the day So not only is there immense quantities of energy lying around for free, but vast amounts arrive every second from our friendly neighbourhood fusion reactor, the sun. Irradiation on the earth is about 130 Petawatts. That's about four orders of magnitude more than human energy consumption. Or, to put it another way, sunlight on one ten-thousandth of the Earth's surface brings energy in at about the same average rate as global energy demand. Energy's value varies hugely in time and space But it gets worse, as far as currencies are concerned. See, energy's value differs constantly in time, in space and in form. You must have noticed that wind and sunlight are free - no one's charging you for them - and they're energy. Whereas you have to pay for natural gas. You probably pay even more, joule for joule, for diesel or petrol (gasoline). And you will pay a lot more for electricity. On top of that, one unit of electricity has a very different price depending on where and when you buy it, and the quantity you're buying it in. Energy's form drives its economic value. 1 Joule is rarely worth 1 Joule Electricity is a really high quality vector of energy: it can do huge amounts of work. But you can only use it in the instant it's generated (ok, you can store it briefly in a capacitor, but that will cost you, too). Heat is a really low quality vector of energy: and the closer the temperature is to ambient temperature, the less work it can do. i.e. the less economic value it has. Now, we've got enough problems with variable marginal values of money as it is, without this scale of problem. The other thing is, if you're storing your currency of energy as heat, it's losing its value every second as it cools off. Yet, at the same time, cooling has economic value, in aircon and in refrigeration. So that's a lack of energy that has economic value. Many energy transformations add economic value but consume energy Refining crude oil costs you energy and other resources. And the end product is more valuable, which is why people do it, and make a profit at it. But that would be absurd if energy were the currency. On sophistry I've seen the argument for an energy currency before. Usually, when you dig deeper, they're not really talking about an energy currency. They're actually trying to sell something. Typically, but not always, fossil gas. So their proposed energy currency turns out to be something very like gas futures contracts (which have the usual commodity-currency problems: control of supply lies with one industry, not democratically-elected governments; and the whole economy is exposed to high short-term volatility). Now, as we know, we've got far more gas than we can possibly burn (see my colleagues' paper in Nature on this), and the gas industry is starting to get nervous. And so it should. This desparate bid for a "gas currency" is just one more bit of special pleading and rent-seeking from what must become a dying industry.
