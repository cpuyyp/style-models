Shots that hit either the post or the crossbar are not considered Shots on Goal. Currently, they are quantified as a Missed Shot. These shots are included with shots that miss the net entirely; as such, they will appear in both Fenwick and Corsi totals (note that Corsi is just Fenwick plus blocked shots). There's no way to extract these data currently. However, we can estimate the relative frequency with which shots hit the crossbar versus shots that hit either post. The net is 6 feet wide by 4 feet high. Since there are two posts, this means that (roughly) the crossbar is 6 linear feet and the posts are 8 linear feet. Naively, then, one would expect that the crossbar is hit at a 3:4 ratio to the posts. However, while shooting, one typically picks one side of the net to shoot at. If you miss your shot while trying to pick a side, you're probably not going to hit the post on the other side of the goal, unless you're a very bad shooter. So really, the crossbar might get hit at a rate of about 3:2 compared to the post, or about 50% more shots hit the crossbar than hit the post. This is just a naive approximation. Practically speaking, shooters have very small windows with which to work. Goalies cover a lot of area quickly in today's NHL, and so shooters are often gunning for extremes. The posts provide a visual reference of your target. When the goalie is moving and changing angles, the posts provide a fixed frame of reference with strong visual contrast. Many shooters try to aim for the inside of the posts with their shots, because it's usually the farthest you can target from the goalie and still hope to score. Probably more shots miss the net entirely than hit a post, and probably close to as many shots that hit the crossbar and go out (quantified as a miss) hit the crossbar and go in (quantified as a goal and a SOG). When weighing this approximation against all total shots, I'd say hitting the crossbar is more rare than hitting any other similarly-sized window of the net, but without very accurate puck telemetry data, it's impossible to conclude that. 

Gordie Howe came out of retirement to play with his sons, Mark and Marty Howe, when the WHA came into being. After the WHA merged with the NHL, Mark and Gordie played together with the Hartford Whalers for one season. Sources: Gordie Howe, Mark Howe 

A hockey puck is a very flat cylinder. We may compute very easily the Moment of Inertia of a hockey puck in both the axis of symmetry (going through the center of the puck from top to bottom) and the central axis (going through the sides of the puck) quite easily. The moment of inertia around the axis of symmetry is 27 square inch square ounces, while moment of inertia around the central axis is 28.5 inch square ounces. These quantities are not vastly different, and if you grab a hockey puck, it's about as easy to flip as it is to spin. The difference, however, is that a hockey puck's stable attitude is going to be laying flat. As such, most of the time when you play with the puck, it's going to tend to lay flat on the ice. It's not hard to flip a puck end-over-end, but unlike the aerodynamics of a ball, a hockey puck has relatively large flat surfaces. This makes controlling the puck in such a way very difficult, and it's quite hard to shoot a puck if it's not laying flat. Due to the motion of a shot and the geometry of a stick blade, shooting a puck on-edge makes it much more prone to go high, and it's hard to control the accuracy. In addition, it's much harder to shoot the puck with any high velocity, as the puck doesn't sit well in the blade of the stick. Like a football, a puck flipping end-over-end will bounce unpredictably. Occasionally, players will attempt to surprise a goalie by flipping the puck to try to get a lucky bounce, and even in the pros, it happens a few times a year that a goalie lets one by. However, flipping the puck at the goalie like this is a low-probability play, and it is one that is nearly guaranteed to result in a change of possession. Consequently, it's rarely done. It's much better to try to shoot the puck hard and accurate in order to beat the goalie in a spot where they're not expected to make a save. In this case, the spin of the puck actually does very little in terms of its dynamics. The puck is too heavy and the flight times are too short for the Magnus Effect to have much of an impact on the puck's trajectory, and the moments of inertia being so close in value mean that the rotational effect does very little to stabilize the puck. The spin is a consequence of the shot mechanics -- stick blades are curved to give the player control over the puck while handling it and shooting it, not to induce spin. The pace of hockey is extremely fast. Any deception is better suited by using your other players (e.g. fake a shot and pass to an open player with a better view of the net) than attempting to play trickery with a shot. Even a 65 mph shot, which is fairly slow, especially for the pros, will travel 25 feet in about a quarter of a second. Speed and accuracy, not deception, are the shooter's best friend. 

While reading about Gael Clichy during the Arsenal vs. Manchester City game, I noticed that he was signed from Arsenal for an undisclosed fee. As far as I understand Arsenal is a public limited company - I will admit that I am not very knowledgeable about this financial talk. Galatasaray is in a similar position, however, they need to declare all of their signings and the signings' total income when the transfer is finalized. Further, they have to declare when transfer talks are in play to not be charged, AFAIK, due to being a public company in the Turkish stock market. We see a similar situation with Barcelona FC and the signing of Neymar. So how can Manchester City and Arsenal manage to hide the exchange of money for a transfer? Shouldn't that be public knowledge? 

I know that my answer is rather late and I like Orangecrush's answer as well. However, I don't think all of the factors of their descent in power has been in their control. To complete the suggestions of Orangecrush's answer, one has to go back a couple of years: Start & End of the Rafa Benitez Era Rafa Benitez took over control of LFC at the end of the 03-04 season. He is a tactical mind and has a systematic reign over any club that he chooses to train. I am quite fond of his tactics, especially when it comes to creating deep squads and having a player circulation with the extensive football fixtures out there. After taking control of LFC, he had the infamous AC Milan victory in Istanbul, finished third in the Premier League, became runners-up for the Champions League in 2007 and then followed this all with a 2nd place finish in 08-09. The last year of Rafa's tenure was the following season, when LFC failed and finished 7th in the EPL (source). Change of Ownership: The Gillet Era While Rafa Benitez was in control of the football team, Gillet and Hicks became owners of the club to the somewhat dissatisfaction of the loyal Liverpool KOP (Gillet family also own the majority of the Canadiens here in Montreal and that team has not seen any success in decades, either). Only a single season when Rafa Benitez was not successful was enough for the American owners to part ways with him, whereas Rafa's approach (as Arsene Wenger's and Sir Alex Ferguson's) has always been systematic and required patience and stability. Financial Challenges and loss of Key Players In 10-11 LFC was very close to bankruptcy and in dire need of cash. The club has already lost key players like Xabi Alonso to the likes of Real Madrid, a key opponent in the European competition. More and more players have parted ways with LFC, while the club struggled to keep hold of even their infamous captain, Steven Gerard. Finally, the club let go of the indispensable Fernando Torres and in a yet undefined, stupid move purchased mediocre players like Andy Carroll. The coming of the Manchester City FC and Chelsea FC Last but not least, Manchester City and Chelsea, both regular mid-table performers have been purchased by oil-rich owners and had their bank accounts flooded with money. The teams purchased top talent into the EPL that the likes of which could only competed with Manchester United. With all the money and the following success, it has been very, very difficult for LFC to bring in top talent into the situation. All the instability caused by the number of departures (especially post-Rafa Benitez era) and the change of power in the EPL have signalled the difficult days ahead for LFC. Arsenal have faced the same situation as well, and are struggling with adapting to the situation. The bringing of Brendan Rogers to lead the team has been a brilliant move, especially after his success at Swansea City. Yet, his challenges are huge; just take a look at the situation created by King Kenny Dalglish and the star forward Luis Su√°rez. 

There are other sources that make even more bizarre claims matching those in the question, but I chose to stick to verifiable sources. 

If the ball becomes flat or breaks into more than one piece, conditions 1, 3, 4 and 5 would be violated thus rendering the ball defective. 

How about the sport of Quidditch? It is a game inspired from a work of fiction, but its rules have been formally defined. there is an international regulatory body for the sport, the International Quidditch Association and there have been international and regional championships for the sports too, such as the IQA World Cup. Having established the validity of Quidditch as a sport, here is how it is a valid answer to your question. Quidditch is played using 5 balls at the same time. One quaffle, three bludgers and one snitch. The snitch typically comes into play after a certain amount of time has elapsed, so at any time, at least 4 four balls are in play at the same time. 

Some internet sleuthing led me to this article from 2010 wherein the author has listed cases where being struck by a golf ball led to a fatality. The author's research has provided 8 instances of death by a golf ball over a roughly 17 year period. What is important to note is that all these deaths seem to involve amateur golfers or the unfortunate victims being on the fairway or greens at the wrong time. On the PGA Tour, I believe this is not a major hazard as the chances of wayward shots into (significantly large) crowds would be negligible considering the skill level of the players. My research has not uncovered incidents of golf ball induced death on the PGA Tour, so it seems that this is a negligible hazard for crowds at PGA Tour events. Edit: Some more research led me to this feelgood story from May 2016 where an onlooker was hit on the head by PGA Tour golfer Tony Finau. There are a few more instances of such injuries on the PGA Tour. However, the odds of them being fatal are significantly less as such events usually have a competent medical staff available during the tournament, which greatly reduces the chances of injuries to players or onlookers turning fatal. 

The numbers that confuse you have nothing to do with the tournament schedule per se. The link you are viewing shows ongoing ATP tournaments. There are 6 ATP tournaments that are currently ongoing, which I have listed below. 

If the shooter fails to make contact with the intended striped ball, the ball MUST go on to touch another striped ball and one of the balls must make contact with a rail, otherwise the shot is a foul and the opponent gets the ball in hand. In case the cue ball makes first contact with another striped ball and one of the balls makes contact with a rail, the player simply loses his turn. 

Regarding your opinion that manufacturers should provide such material coating on their products to avoid the need for taping, the main problem is friction. After a few uses, whatever material is coated will start to wear off. Rather than having a partly worn off coating on a stick, it's better to use inexpensive tape before each game to ensure a consistent level of control and discard it after use. 

My question stems from the highlighted part of the paragraph from Wikipedia. Have there been any notable cases in international or domestic cricket where a batsman has played on because of a lack of appeal from the fielding team? 

The wording of Law 30 which covers the scenario of a batsman getting bowled out is as follows (emphasis mine). 

The referees for the Premier League, Football League and FA competitions are appointed by the Professional Game Match Officials Limited. When referees make frequent and/or glaring errors in matches, the PGMOL reprimands them in the form of demotion to a lower tier of the Football League. In the 2009-10 season, referee Mike Jones was demoted to the Championship after incorrectly awarding a goal to Sunderland against Liverpool, after Darren Bent's shot at goal deflected off a beach ball into the goal. Later in the same season, referee Mike Dean and assistant referee Simon Beck were demoted to the Championship following poor performances in a match between Manchester United and Chelsea. Dean failed to award a penalty each to both sides for tackles in the box and also allowed a goal to stand when he should have called a handball, while Beck failed to give an offside decision for Didier Drogba that led to a Chelsea goal. In the game between West Ham United and Manchester United referenced in the question, only the second goal scored by Zlatan Ibrahimovic was offside. The other decision in the match that drew criticism was the harsh red card shown to West Ham's Sofiane Feghouli. It is up to the PGMOL to consider if these two decisions are significantly erroneous to warrant a reprimand against Mike Dean or assistant referee Simon Long.
