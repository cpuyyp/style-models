The Donuts game! Facing similar challenges we adopted a solution in my workplace for this called the "donuts" game. Keep in mind that this does have a tendency to be somewhat distracting. For this reason we don't run this year round, only in December when the pressure is off and there's a lighter mood in the office that we want to foster heading into the Christmas break. Rules The game is quite simple - if you leave your computer unlocked and another team member notices then they have free reign to open your e-mail client and e-mail the team e-mail the word 'donuts' from your account. Each time somebody does this to you successfully that's one point against your name. The person at the end of the week that has the most points against their name has to buy donuts for the team for our SCRUM standup on Monday morning. This has the benefit of challenging people to be the best they can be at locking their machines, and creates an informal penalty system for those that continue to fail in locking their machine. But does it work for you? Keep in in mind that this isn't for all work environments - we have a team it works really well for and we talked about it as a group to make sure everybody was on board before starting. I strongly advise considering your team and the personalities involved before putting something like this in place. Also be sure to consider whether there are any issues with team members using another's machine, even to send an e-mail. The medical industry in many locales will specifically prevent this (either through regulation or a need for high privacy), the finance industry would in many cases be the same. If these aren't a barrier though - have fun! 

As a development team lead at a not-for-profit company: definitely not. You didn't work for this company, you worked for another one and just had an engagement like any other. Typically employers will check with the companies that you've listed on your resume to ensure that you've actually worked at the locations that you're claiming. If I were to receive a call asking if you had worked at and you had not worked directly with me then I would more than likely be unable to place the name and would state this to your potential employer. 

It's concerning that there's a mandatory training system in place but no central way to check for upcoming sessions. I think it would be worthwhile proposing to your manager that the company look into establishing a central events or training calendar. If you have an Intranet (or SharePoint) team in place this would be worth raising with them. Since these don't appear to be in place and you're doing everything you can to find out about these sessions make sure that each time you send one of the e-mails above you file a copy of it. When you are preparing your talking points for your review bring this together to show that you've actively done as much as possible to attend these in-person sessions. Highlight to them that problem isn't your desire to attend in person sessions but rather a lack of communication that you need your manager to tackle at his level. Also be sure to make up for the shortfall with Online sessions so you meet your targets. Explain what you got out of those but that you believe you would have got more out of internal session because of x or y reasons. 

Building relationships by networking! Increasing your communication regarding sessions is going to help remind people that you're around, and that you're interested in learning new things. I think right now you're not so much being kept out of the loop as you are being overlooked. Network as much as you can to help build relationships with these people so when they are building their lists they think of you. Improving the state of communication You said: 

I would ask Human Resources what they think would be most appropriate or for some suggestions. If they're asking for this change to fit into the corporate culture and existing structure then it's quite likely that they're going to have some idea already of how they would expect your new job title to appear. 

Reflecting on @Dave's comment this seems to be largely cultural. I'm in Australia and over here it would be seen as quite unusual for me to e-mail somebody new by salutation/title. Typically (here at least) I would address them by name and in the first sentence be sure to introduce myself and provide a quick summary of the context of my reaching out to them. If somebody referred me, I'd namedrop that person early to allow for more context. Given that you work for a multi-national organisation chances are whatever approach you take is fine, just follow the same vibe as what your colleagues close by are doing. If I were to receive an e-mail from the Philippines and it was worded a bit differently, I'd chalk it up to cultural differences. I don't see why your international colleagues wouldn't do the same. 

Patience The most important thing here is to be patient with your new peer. Both experience and confidence take time to develop. Whilst he's new in this position he may be seeing some of these issues but as he doesn't hold the same relationship with the stakeholders that you do even if he's seeing some of these issues he may not yet feel confident in raising them. Helping to foster experience and relationships You said: 

I don't think this is advisable. You are in first impressions territory right now with your new employer. From their perspective they've presented you with an offer and you've formally accepted their terms. The negotiating phase has already passed and you're heading into contract territory. 

Understanding job satisfaction Job satisfaction is a measure of yourself (your capacity to work, willingness to work and opportunity to work), the work effort have to expel to complete your work and the organisational support behind you. The amount of contribution you will feel happy giving an organisation is strongly linked to the inducements (remuneration, support, training) that the company is providing you. In this case you mentioned that you don't like your job. It doesn't sound like this is a company providing you enough organisational support or training to outweigh you not feeling like you're receiving adequate remuneration for your efforts. In this case, I think you aren't going to find happiness here without a significant change in your role, and I think you should leave. Your work is likely to suffer over time if you continue to feel unhappy with the position and it sounds like the situation isn't likely to change anytime soon without action from your end. Will it affect your resume? Personally, I don't think so. Not every engagement has to be a perfect one and hiring managers completely understand this. Provided you don't have a number of small stints on your resume it's not going to reflect badly on you if you list this one small window of work. That said, if you've only been there two months and have 10 years of work history in Company A, I also don't think it will hurt you if you leave it off. 10 years work experience, even in the same company, is a great amount of experience. I wouldn't be too concerned about this.
