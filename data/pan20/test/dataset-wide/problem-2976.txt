The basis of Common Law extends back well before the advent of reasonable science, and it is entirely based upon belief of the assembled. In U.S. laws, that can be a judge, a panel of experts or judges, or a jury of the peers of the accused. But there is never a case in which material evidence itself is more important than who believes it, and how convinced they claim to be. We know, from studies of memory and perception, that this is not a reliable standard of evidence from a scientific point of view. We know how memory is rendered harder to retrieve by stress, how our degree of certainty is unrelated to the actual evidence, how memory can be manipulated by the order in which its aspects are later recalled, etc. But we try to adjust for this with redundancy. We try to make the jury large enough that someone on it will not we swayed by these manipulations, and we generally required unanimity. When there is not a panel or jury, we use the thread of appeal to ensure that a manipulated judge is questioned by more rational authorities above him. Since statistics matured, science has an objective reference for when one ought to believe, instead of relying directly upon the ability to convince. But that standard arises later than most of the science we were taught in school. So, to some degree, the science you are used to was equally subject to the personalities involved and their political ambitions. But it has survived centuries of repeated attempts to disprove it. 

It seems likely, given the apparent reversibility of most physical laws, that time does not flow in one direction, but that humans can only perceive it as flowing forward because human memory relies upon increasing entropy as a means of encoding. So the answer becomes 'both'. Since we mark time as increasing entropy, the increase of entropy becomes a physical process in time as we remember it, and we might as well incorporate all of our experience into our theory of the universe. But in a more absolute sense, time is then an aspect of human existence and our experience of similar phenomena around us. For me, this perspective makes sense out of the fact that real-time physical processes seem to employ much more processing power than should be available to them. If they would proceed in a way that ultimately contradicts what human reality permits, time would not continue forward for us very far from that moment, and in the end, we would remember the flow that we are allowed to be part of. All failures and retries edit themselves out of the record of history, so it seems as though nature is almost always 'right'. The Second Law of Thermodynamics (considered as an aspect of humanity and not of physics) creates the effect of the Limited Anthropic Principle on a very detailed level. 

I think you can chalk the whole phenomenon up to natural confirmation bias. Our perceptual system is not as passive as recent history has traditionally depicted it. We do not perceive things and make sense of them. Instead, it seems, perception works by projecting options that would fit our fondest assumptions, and evaluating how they fit with the external data. $URL$ The kind of distortions that appear when we test vision, for instance, show an inordinate level of confirmation bias: illusions of faces everywhere, color discernment that is impaired by unconscious assumptions about the nature of shadow, blatant failure to perceive things that impair meaning (e.g. extra interpolated words that make text less sensible), false perspective, etc. (These and some other examples: $URL$ From a sort of Nietzschean (or 'Selfish Gene') point of view, this is just as it should be: human perception is strongly biased toward seeing things that offer us power over our environment -- things that confirm our powers of prediction, or that answer to our dreams. (Because the nature of an animal, and so a human, is to explore all dimensions of power.) To some degree, explanation is just another layer of perception, and there is no good reason why the higher-order process should be significantly different from the more detailed ones. Psychologists have accepted this for generations, focussing on how strong our tendency to presume and project is. From that perspective, the one explanation that appears to help us the very least is that of complete randomness. It renders us powerless in the instant, so it is very hard to get to. Any alternative that involves people, or deeper meaning will present itself first, unless we have purposely trained ourselves out of considering it -- God and ghosts are a better model, if we think they might listen, or that we can predict their behavior because of their similarities to us. We only dismiss them because we have been making those same jumps for millennia and been wrong. Ironically, science has made incredibly powerful use of the uniformity that results from explanations via complete randomness. But on a case by case basis, we reflexively resist objectivity in this way. That case-by-case 'certainty' comes from our arrogance as to the power of our perceptual mechanisms (which is logically built into the mechanisms themselves) something philosophers have been directly attacking at least since Hinduism first adopted the notion of 'maya', and not from any reasonable epistemic principle. 

In some sense, if you hold no trace of individualism, it should not matter that one is seeing someone victimized, as long as you know certainly that people are, everywhere, being victimized. So no particular reaction is actually required. Of course, if you are not defensively individualistic, compassion toward the victim and reconsideration of the value of the perpetrator is just going to happen, that is almost a biological fact. It can be resisted only by choosing to fight it, which seems perverse. So, if you can comfort the victim or their family, or if you can reasonably and meaningfully take the victimizer to task in the moment, you should follow the natural call to do so. Effectiveness should be considered over personal risk, because your individual value is lower, in toto, than that of the many future people this particular perpetrator might victimize. You need to consider the human ability to completely change, but also its limited likelihood. So what an individualist would label 'heroics' even to the point of para-suicidal intervention, that risks your own life for that of the victim, or some future victim, are not out of order. (It is in this spirit that some monks from anti-individualistic sects are trained in the proper deployment of violence. Stepping into situations of misapplied violence is a natural reaction, if you can effectively restore balance, and serve the greater good.) But your reaction to an event does not need to differ because of your involvement. In a truly selfless world, your experience is not special, and your responsibilities are not prescribed to you individually. So how does one react to the overall existence of victimization? That clearly depends upon the kind of victimization, but the overall approach would have to be to look at the global effect of attempting to control the dynamic causing the victimization. For instance, if this is a hate crime, what is the positive impact of tribalism? Is that worth the loss, and can it be accomplished efficiently in other ways? If this is a simple crime of passion, what can we do to appropriately reinforce responsibility, across the board, unrelated to any given case? To my mind, you are led to a more naturalistic framing of Kantian ethics, where one must respect autonomy, but can presume a layer of shared human instincts that inform the preferences of individuals. Act in the way you could generalize, given the shared notion of human nature that replaces individualism as the root of autonomy. 

Jung once floated a theory on Thales that the easiest thing to imagine all things made of is water because it is one of the pure substances we see in all three forms in a non-technological culture. Seeing ice or mist become water and realizing that they are the same substance is a major, striking scientific development that has spoken profoundly to integrative thinkers. This phenomenon strongly influences various associations water has as an 'element'. It emphasizes the already notable flexibility of the substance to realize that even that flexibility is flexible. If anything was everything, the seemingly infinite changeability of water makes it a prime candidate. At the same time, water has a range of roles in the lives of people near the sea, or in places where very bad weather is about precipitation. It is associated with is the most necessary functions, but also often the most dangerous situations one can be in -- storms, especially at sea, are 'angry' water. We like to imagine the early world as either empty and infinitely peaceful or ultimately chaotic, and those two states are modeled in most places by pools or storms, and therefore as water. Clearly what is comes out of what was 'before it was'. Either through those associations or others, the core meaning of alchemical water is tied up with femininity -- flexibility, extreme anger and extreme peace, the hidden power implicit in the two roles of 'necessary' wife and 'punitive'mother, Kwan Yin and Kali Ma. It is also clear that human life comes, literally, from women. So creation myths around water are often seen from a psychoanalytic point of view as recognizing the power of women as the a active givers of life. Modeling 'the above' on 'the below', we are made both 'by' and 'of' our mothers (not to mention amniotic fluid) and so the world emerges from water. So I think there are enough naturally occurring sources of this motif that we would not need to suppose common sources. I think that to the degree these messages are expressions of shared roots, those roots are less information-transmission than they are natural observations cultures make, which predict impending intellectual development. 

The particular paradoxes that you want to tie up together do seem to share an aspect from a given logical point of view. From a 'hard Intuitionist' point of view, our linguistic construct of negation is incomplete. Brouwer traces them to our difficulty combining two different kinds of distinction related to time. And they don't fit together properly. One is related to counting, time's successiveness, and another is related to continuity, time's 'even flow'. From the one related to counting we get the Law of the Excluded Middle, everything is either before or after this point. And from the one related to continuity we get the notion of completeness, that you can always look closer and see more stuff, but what you see won't contradict what you have already seen from a less complete viewpoint. These inherently contradict, but we can't see that clearly, and we see paradoxes when we have to choose just one of them. Zeno's paradox is the clearest example of how they fail to fit together, we count off subdivisions of space, as our intuition of space naturally fills up all the gaps, and we are left wondering whether the process should or should not be allowed to finish. The problems with the unrestrained use of infinitesimals are just Zeno's Paradox generalized. We have to accept continuity over iteration, and that does not sit well with us. Cantor gives us some idea why. But we can't really keep it straight in our heads. Russell's paradox is more about looking outside than inside, but from an intuitionistic point of view, the fact we can always find a set to wrap around any given set is splitting infinity in the same way Zeno is splitting a finite distance. It creates a boundlessly multiplying world, which like the continuum, 'presumably fills in' all gaps made by any distinction. We then attempt to apply the Law of the Excluded Middle to every distinction, all at once. And we fail. Our basic notion of implication also intrinsically involves negation. We like the notion that A -> B <=> B v ~A. But this notion leads us into paradoxes like "If this statement is true, then Santa Claus said it first." Our wish to have LEM conflicts with our wish to have every statement be true or false, and this one is either both, or vacuous. Etc. But negation is not the only source of confusion in classical logic. There are other equally weak concepts that incompletely capture other intuitions. Our grasp on what can and cannot be compared, and why, is somewhat weak. We have a bias toward the idea that any partial order easily yields a total order. This makes us imagine the Prisoner's Dilemma should have the wrong answer, and to balk at the Game of Intransitive Dice and the related oddness in the way probabilities behave. We can see how the first boring number would not be boring, because it would elucidate the nature of boringness, which would make it less boring. We have a definite partial order which cannot base a total order. And that is annoying. Infinity makes this situation worse, netting us various ethical problems which involve multiple lives and attempts to compare different losses of life, which basically challenges our intuition to come up with consistent extra rules to order ratios of infinities. And the Axiom of Choice, which is equivalent to this notion that order is either there or not, via Zorn's Lemma, leads straight into the Banach-Tarski paradox about measurability, size and the nature of solidity. Putting our problems with probability and divisibility together, statistics, which is infinitely divisible probability, creates its own host of paradoxes. So I would claim there may be large classes of paradoxes traceable to any one specific weak intuition, but that there are at least a few unrelated sources of paradox, and beyond that different paradoxes arise by combining different sets of weak intuitions.
