(my own plot, the series are from FRED database (GDPDEF and DPCERD3Q086SBEA), seasonnaly adjusted, growth rate between the same quarter from the previous year) Having this in mind, recall that the real GDP is calculated as the nominal GDP divided by the GDP deflator. Thus the price of the domestic goods procuded and consumed in the country are in both CPI and real GDP. Here comes your correlation. 

In the strict classical Hotelling model, it is impossible to have an equilibrium with 3 agents over the segment (deviation is always profitable). Some modification have been done to keep the transportation costs+inelastic demand with $n$ firms (with multiple segments and a common point, like a flake). By the way, d'Aspremont et al. modified the cost function to reach "their" equilibrium. 

Your first equation is an indirect utility function. The consumer chooses only one good and we assume that he can afford it. For simplification, the indirect utility discards the budget $m$ (often assumed be the same for all $i$). Here, your demand function is perfectly inelastic. If the individual demand would not have been perfectly inelastic, the form would have been like $V=a-s(p)$, where $s'$ is strictly concave and increasing. See, for example, Palma/Anderson/Thisse. 

Your professor want probably that you compute the keynesian multiplicator (hint: once you have the general formula, replace dT by dG and see what you get). Intuition: if you raise G, you will raise your GDP. As Y increases, your consumption increases. But the taxes (T, lump sum) increase also, so the consumption decreases (it depends of the disposable income). The overall effect is a 1 to 1 increase of your GDP. 

Basically it's better to use the software your PI uses! First (s)he will be able to correct your code. Second, if you're a TA for a class using one software, it's better to handle it... To find the faculty using R, either have a look at the papers/books published by one department. Or look at the R-packages published in your field and find the authors. I wouldn't look at the cost of a software, because the university often provided it for free or can reimburse you. (Of course you can prefer free softwares for other aspects but then it's not a budget constraint). 

The CPI encompasses the price of consumed goods (some of them are domestically produced, other are imported). The GDP deflator takes into account only the goods produced domestically (some of them are consumed here, other are exported). Thus there is some correlation between the GDP deflator and the CPI as you can see below 

In the standard model, all workers have the same productivity. So if J < 0, your expected value of a vacancy would also be negative. That the reason why, once a match is made, the only variable to be set is the wage. In the real world, they have to deal with different expected productivities. Pissarides 94 distinguished between two kinds of applicants (but in this case, the firm is passive in the decisions). 

This equation is commonly named wage growth rate (in discrete time) in its simplest form (the difference between two consecutive periods). Your notations understanding is correct. "average wage increase" because $W$ is an "average level" by definition. 

the two money changers would not sell currency out of their inventory at all, but would only do the deal so far as they could lay it off immediately. But in your imaginary world there is only one trade and one period. My guess is that your understanding of the (modern) currency trading is not know[n] very well. 

Depending of the accuracy you're looking at (stylized facts or estimated parameters), private database like $URL$ may help you to support your theory. Some institutions grant access to them. Some industries (e.g. tobacco) have their info widespread. A (non-exhaustive) list: $URL$ 

Yes. Generally, the set of best replies is always a mixture over the set of pure best replies. In particular, there is never a strict incentive to play a mixed strategy, a player playing a mixed best response is indifferent between all pure strategies in the support of the mixed strategy. All this follows from the linearity of expected utility. 

This has important policy consequences that seem to be widely misunderstood. In the book The Bankers' New Clothes by Admati and Hellwig, the authors argue, fundamentally realying on MM, that higher equity requirements for Banks may reduce their profits, but will not reduce economic investment. This very much contradicts the story lobbyists for banks like to tell. 

Yes, SARP implies WARP. Since all choices are singletons under SARP, we abuse notation and write $C$ as a function that takes alternatives as values. We prove the contrapositive, every violation of WARP in a setting where choices are unique give rise to a violation of SARP. So assume there are sets $B$, $B'$ containing $x$ and $y$ such that $c(B)=x$ and $C(B')=y$. Letting $B_1=B$ and $B_2=B'$, you get a direct violation of SARP (I take it you require $x_i\neq x_{i+1}$ in the definition of SARP). In the context of budget sets, SARP implies GARP. Let $B_i=\{x\mid p_ix\leq p_ix_i\}$. Then SARP says that if $p_i x_{i+1}\leq p_i x_i$ but $x_i$ is the unique choice from $B_i$ for $i\in\{1,\ldots,N_1\}$, then $p_N x_i>p_N x_N$. So the case $p_N x_i\leq p_N x_N$ can never occur; GARP cannot be violated. Now GARP as usually formulated is a condition on data sets consisting of price-choice combinations. It is not required that the same price system leads to the same choice, so GARP does not imply SARP. 

A good is normal if its demand is increasing in income. So let $p_x$ and $p_y$ be the price of the goods with quantities $x$ and $y$ and let $m$ be income. Suppose $ax>by$. Then $\min\{ax,by\}=by$. By slightly reducing $x$ by and spending the saved money on $y$, one gets a better bundle. For an optimal bundle, this cannot be. Similarly, it cannot be optimal that $by>ax$. So in the optimal consumption bundle, it must be the case that $ax=by$. It is also not that hard to see that the consumer will spend all her income. So rewrite the condition as $$y=\frac{a}{b}x$$ and plug it into the budget equation $$p_x x+p_y y=m$$ to get $$p_x x+ p_y\frac{a}{b}x=m=x\Big(p_x+p_y\frac{a}{b}\Big).$$ Therefore, we get the demand function given by $$x(p_x,p_y,m)=\frac{m}{p_x+p_y\frac{a}{b}},$$ which is clearly increasing in $m$. Similarly, one shows that the other good is normal too. Pedantic remark: A differentiable function can be increasing at every point without the derivative being strictly positve everywhere. The function given by $x\mapsto x^3$ has derivative $0$ at $0$ but is everywhere increasing. 

The main reason differential topology had some success in economics is that supplies powerful methods to show that something holds generically, mainly Sard's theorem and the transversality theorem. Some of these methods have been generalized to contexts without differentiability, see for example the paper "A Prevalent Transversality Theorem for Lipschitz Functions" by Shannon. Differential topology is still used in general equilibrium theory, you might take a look at recent work of Yves Balasko. In positive political theory, there are results to the effect that generically no majority winner exists in multidimensional spatial voting models. A good introduction to this topic is the book "Positive Political Theory I" by Austen-Smith and Banks, the definitive treatment is the paper "The generic existence of a core for q-rules" by Saari. Inspired by the work on regular equilibria in general equilibrium theory, regular Nash equilibria were also studied in game theory, starting with Harsanyi. An elegant approach can be found in the paper "The theory of normal form games from the differentiable viewpoint" by Ritzberger (preprint here). Many genericity results in general equilibrium have corresponding versions in game theory, for example, "most" normal form games have a finite and odd number of Nash equilibria. Another area where differential topology is used is in the study of stability with respect to some dynamics. Indeed, one can define regular equilibria via the replicator dynamic from evolutionary game theory (that is how Ritzberger does it). For a recent example of using some differential topology (index theory, treat also in more generality), see the working paper "The Index +1 Principle" by McLennan. 

Do you know of a package allowing to create objects representing agents with (strict) preferences over (a finite set of) discrete objects $A,B,C,â€¦$, and profiles thereof. A minimal requirement would be to have a method like defined on any instance of the class, with returning if the agent likes $X$ more than $Y$, and otherwise. The only related package I have found so far is . Do you know of any other? 

This is only half a joke : Nash-equilibrium gives a very good prediction on the relative size of groups of foraging ducks on a pond when two food sources are established at opposite sides of the pond. A very good explanation can be found at $URL$ among other places ($URL$ is where the image comes from). In my views, this example illustrates how the concept of Nash-equilibrium can be sometimes characterize the "steady states" of dynamic/repeated games. 

de Finneti observed that these were necessary but could not determine whether they were sufficient. Eventually, Kraft, Pratt & Seidenberg (1959) provided a counter-example as well as an additional condition which, together with the four others implied the existence of an additive representation: 

Beside the work of Chichilnisky mentioned by Michael, another interesting use of topology in social choice theory appears in the work of Redekop on Arrow's theorem on economic domains. 

The question of designing matching procedure (between high-schools and students, med intern and hospitals, kidney donors and receivers,...) has been widely studied by economists and vastly contributed to Roth and Shapley receiving the Nobel memorial price in economics. I was wondering if you knew about any freely available code out there (ideally in a relatively high-level language) able to compute solutions to the main kind matching problems for some of the most famous algorithms proposed in the literature. I am thinking of writing one, but I'd rather not it already exists. I am chiefly interested in some piece of code to compute the solution to Deferred Acceptance algorithm in a school choice problem, but anything else would be appreciated. 

What is your experience teaching this? What are your tricks to get around this terminological difficulty? (Or, maybe, why do you think it is not a terminological difficulty at all?) 

A partial answer : I m not sure what measurement the World Bank would recommend, but I suspect that in practice, the expenses that are taken into account to measure whether one is below or above the 1.25$ threshold vary from one study to another. For instance in their famous The Economic Lives of the Poor, Banerjee and Duflo write 

Now the problem if we are to get to any "equivalence" statement is that on the one hand, we have the BE which "lives" in a world with... beliefs, and on the other the NE notion which lives in a world... exempt of beliefs. So what would an equivalence statement like "NE $\Leftrightarrow$ BE" possibly mean? 1) BE $\Rightarrow$ NE This direction of the implication is probably uncontroversial, because we go from a more complex to a more simple model. "Every BE is a NE" should mean that if we look at the equilibrium strategy profile of a BE alone (that is without its supporting belief profile $p$), it should be a NE. One can check that this is the case. 2) NE $\Rightarrow$ BE This is the tricky part. What does it mean that "Every NE is a BE"? Certainly not that "a NE plus any belief profile is a BE", as the OP showed with his counter-example. Yet, it is the case that "any NE can be made a BE for some belief profile". I think it is in this sense that one should understand Osborne's "equivalence" claim Notice that we also have the following more "equivalence-like" statement : "An outcome of the game is a NE outcome if and only if it is a BE outcome".
