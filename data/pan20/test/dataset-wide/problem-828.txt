Messier 22 (also known as M22 or NGC 6656) is an elliptical globular cluster in the constellation Sagittarius, near the Galactic bulge region. Star forming region N11B lies in the Large Magellanic Cloud. The Homunculus Nebula is a bipolar reflection nebula surrounding the massive star system Eta Carinae. Hoag's Object: a Ring Galaxy. On the outside is a ring dominated by bright blue stars, while near the center lies a ball of much redder stars. Detail of the Keyhole Nebula. The small nebula to the upper left has been nicknamed \"finger of God\" or \"God's birdie\", due to the gesture it appears to be making. Reflection nebulosity near Merope (IC 349).

The Lagoon Nebula Planetary Nebula NGC 6543, the \"Cat's Eye Nebula\" is thought to have formed one one star of a double system went supernova. NGC 1999 is a dust filled bright nebula with a vast hole of empty space represented by a black patch of sky. 

This would seem to be constrained to planets and moons earth has landed on or impacted at all, as we have no way of telling after the fact whether a lander was perfectly sterilized. That list is as follows: Planets: 

LIGO detectors have two 4 km arms, and everything in those arms in suspended in a vacuum. The actual dimensions of those arms I was unable to find, but the published paper here has more information for you to peruse. 

I understand basically that the universe is homogenous (looks the same from every point) and I was told in my astro class that it's supposed to have no center, but how that works boggles my mind. I can't get over the feeling that from some point in the universe a civilization could look in a certain direction and see a sign indicative of the direction towards the edge or the center, like younger galaxies or a lack of galaxies moving a certain direction. EDIT: Thanks to Sir Cumference for highlighting some things that are unclear about my question. Sure, to a certain extent you might be able to think of the universe as being without a center, but if you think of a ball growing larger from nothing, and you pick a random point in the growing sphere, you can always say that the point is further from some points on the sphere than others, or in other words, that there is a direction towards a "center". Any other details you can give that are related at all would be extremely welcome. 

To answer my own question: no, not that I can find. Here is an attempt to identify them by image search. Let me know if there is an image/legend match that seems wrong. I can upload a higher resolution (466x426 px) version of the image. The images were cropped from the original image when it was oriented so the the 'HUBBLE SPACE TELESCOPE' message read from the bottom to top of image, and I will try to identify them in the same order. As such, we do 1 column at a time from top to bottom, starting from the right most. The column is marked in red above/below. But first, here is the captioned video created from combining the captions with a video slideshow of the images! Column 1

I have a 6000px x 4800 px version of this image (reduced & rotated to 480x600 here) that I use for an image slide show. I would like to add the description of each image into the slide show software. On this system the file name is but I suspect I coined that title (it was a long time ago it was downloaded). The original image is 5,150,779 bytes in size. Searching on the smaller, rotated version of the image points to pages like Astronomy Printshop, but there is nothing closely related to NASA in the first pages of the search, and the pages listed did not have much detail (certainly no legend). It might possible to search on the clipped, individual images, but I was hoping to avoid having to do that 88 times. 

I was reading the paper about LIGO's detection of gravitational waves, and I wanted to know what the Schwarzschild Radius did. For example, I feel like the simulation here is oversimplified, and that reality wouldn't actually have that simple bump together of the two radii. 

I know some measures must exist, but I have no idea what the programs are, what organizations are involved, or how effective they are. 

This is plausible, and might even be a good idea if used right. First off, NASA has been working on plans for an asteroid redirect mission, called ARM. While it remains to be seen whether this will be approved, and they plan to put it into lunar orbit, this is a hypothetical scenario anyways so I'll ignore that. Now, putting an asteroid into earth orbit is a little bit of a difficult subject. Sure, you could do it, but messing up would net you a whole lot of problems. I presume it would have to go into high earth orbit if it goes into orbit at all. This rules out using the asteroid directly like a satellite, but that would have been impractical even if it was sanctioned by everyone with enough influence to have an opinion on earth. From there the satellite would be best used as a base of operations, from which you could send drones to collect junk and keep refueling stations. I'd also include a telescope or two, but that's personal preference. If you want a list of targets though, here would be a good place to look.
