Perhaps a prominent example is the definition of a smooth manifold. Some authors require the underlying locally Euclidean Hausdorff space to be 2nd countable, while others require it to be only paracompact. The latter is more general since it allows for uncountable number of connected components, although I'm not sure if that makes such a big difference in the everyday life of a differential geometer. But usually there is no room for confusion since most authors state at the beginning which convention they use. EDIT: It turns out it actually does make a pretty big difference, see Stefan Waldmann's comment below. 

Certainly, a composition series of length $n$ of $\mathbb{R}$-vector subspaces exists, but it is not immediately obvious to me how one arranges for the additional condition to hold. The only reference he gives for this fact is Pierce's book "Associative Algebras", where the author only treats Jordan-HÃ¶lder for (sub)modules without any special additional multiplicative structure from what I can tell. Hence my question is: 

Another thing I would like to see (not strictly math only) is a proper editor for .djvu (for all platforms) documents the way there are such editors for .pdf documents. Especially for bigger scanned documents (like many historical stuff in math), .djvu offers much better compression and much smoother viewing performance. To my knowledge, there is only one program that comes close to a .djvu editor, but unfortunately it is lacking in many regards. On a related note, it would be nice to have a proper .pdf editor, native for Linux (there is one that comes close to the Windows ones, but it is not developed and has many problems, including usability ones), so that one does not need to use (the somewhat unstable) wine. 

My main reference here is Lorch - The Theory of Analytic Functions in Normed Abelian Vector Rings (1942) (freely available from AMS). Basically, in this paper Lorch shows that the classical function theory of a single complex variable can be carried over to the infinite-dimensional setting, i.e. replace $\mathbb{C}$ everywhere by a commutative complex Banach algebra $A$. In particular, this includes the notions of a rectifiable curve $\gamma$ taking values in $A$ and of a line integral $\int_\gamma f(Z)dZ$ for continuous functions $f:A\to A$ (or defined on some subset of $A$ containing the image of $\gamma$). I am using $Z$ instead of $z$ to denote the $A$-valued variable on purpose in order to distinguish from the case of Banach-space-valued holomorphic functions $g:\mathbb{C}\to A$, which are still a different animal. Lorch notes that $\exp:A\to A$ takes values in $G$ (denoted by $G_1$ in his paper) and proves that the periods of $\exp$ are given precisely by $$ 2\pi i\sum_{k=1}^n\pm j_k, $$ for $j_k$ some (wlog. non-trivial) idempotents of $A$. In particular, $\exp$ is simply periodic iff $A$ is irreducible. Finally he defines $$ \log(Z):=\int_1^Z\frac{dX}{X}, $$ where the path from $1$ to $Z$ is an arbitrary one in $U(A)$, the group of units. In particular, $\log$ takes arguments only from $G$. He notes that $\log:G\to A$ is surjective and it's "multi-valued" in accordance with the periods of $\exp$. 

This is a follow-up question to my previous question on "winding numbers" of curves in higher-dimensional space. I thought it best to post a new question rather than changing the setup of the previous one from the ground... The comments and answers there suggest that in this case the point of view (pun intended) shouldn't be a point, but really a higher-dimensional object. So, what we are really looking for is $w(\gamma,X)$, the number of windings of a loop $\gamma$ around an appropriate topological subspace $X\subseteq\mathbb{R}^n$ (to be determined). Example 1.: Let $L$ be a line and $X:=C:=\mathbb{D}^2\times L$ a solid cylinder in $\mathbb{R}^3$. Then intuitively $w(\gamma,C)$ should be determined by the homotopy class of $[\gamma]$ in $\pi_1(\mathbb{R}^3\setminus C)$. But I believe this example to be misleading. Example 2: Let $X:=\mathbb{S}^2$. Surely we can count how many rounds/loops a yarn $\gamma$ makes around $X$, even though $\pi_1(X)=0$. It seems $w(\gamma,X)$ shouldn't always be homotopy-invariant. 

Let $R$ be a noncommutative ring (with unit). Then a "fully noncommutative" (for a lack of better wording) monomial over $R$ in the single noncommutative indeterminate $X$ of degree $d$ is given by a finite sum of words of the form $$ r_0 X r_1 X...X r_{d-1} X r_d,$$ where $r_0,...,r_d\in R$. Then one constructs the ring of "fully noncommutative" polynomials in $X$ in the obvious way. Analogously, one gets "fully noncommutative" polynomials and formal power series over $R$ in several or infinitely many noncommutative variables. (Note that this construction should not be confused with $R\langle X,Y\rangle$, where the variables do not commute with each other but are assumed to commute with the $R$-coefficients.) 

Consider the ring $\mathbb{C}[[X,Y]]$ and its subring $\mathbb{C}[[X+iY]]$, where $i=\sqrt{-1}$. One can show that $f(X,Y):=u(X,Y)+iv(X,Y)\in \mathbb{C}[[X,Y]]$ lies in $\mathbb{C}[[X+iY]]$ iff $u$ and $v$ satisfy the CR-equations formally. The necessary condition follows by straightforward formal (algebraic) derivation of the homogeneous parts, whereas the "if" part follows from the fact that the homogeneous parts are holomorphic polynomial functions, hence represented by a (homogeneous) polynomial function in a single complex variable (that part uses analysis since we have to look at the polynomials as polynomial functions). Nevertheless, I cannot shake the feeling that the usage of a complex analysis argument is an overkill since the whole thing seems to play out in the algebraic realm. 

Apologies if my question is inappropriate for MO, I am looking forward to learning about formal differential operators and equations in the algebraic setting. Thanks! 

I have been browsing "Topological Degree Theory and Applications" by Cho, Chen and O'Regan as well as "Mapping Degree Theory" by Outerelo and Ruiz, but I have not been able to quite answer myself the following question: 

Using the definitions of the tensors $R$ and $T$, it is immediate that a necessary condition for $\nabla$ to be 'associative' is $$ R(X,Y)Z = \nabla_{T(X,Y)}Z $$ The motivation for this definition is the single curious observation that if $\nabla$ is 'associative', then $\mathfrak{X}(M)$ becomes an associative $\mathbb{R}$-algebra via the multiplication $X\ast Y:=\nabla_X Y$, although at the moment I am not really sure what this is good for... But one step at a time! I've added the complex geometry tag, because I am actually more interested in the complex setting (i.e. associative $\mathbb{C}$-algebras). In other words, I look at such a pair $(M,\nabla)$, if existing, as another source for associative (complex, possibly Banach?) algebras and would like to know how sound the differential-geometric side of it is. 

For the sake of completeness, here are some more references that cover the subject quite extensively, that, however, are older than 1995, but not necessarily older than the first edition of Yosida's book (which is from 1980): 

Perhaps it is worth mentioning that in their book "Mapping Degree Theory" Outerelo and Ruiz give a general definition of the winding number based on the topological (Brouwer-Kronecker) degree, which was already mentioned in a previous answer. The point being that, while it is a special case of the mapping degree, it is a generalization of the usual winding number that is interesting on its own. Theorem-Definition: Let $U\subseteq\mathbb{R}^n$ be bounded and open, let $X:=\partial U$ be the boundary hypersurface, let $f\in C^0(X,\mathbb{R}^n)$, let $\bar{f}:\bar{U}\to\mathbb{R}^n$ be a continuous extension of $f$ (the set of such extensions is non-empty by Tietze's extension theorem), and let $p\in\mathbb{R}^n\setminus f(X)$. Then $\deg(\bar{f},U,a)$ does not depend on the choice of continuous extension $\bar{f}$, and one defines $$ w(f,a):=\deg(\bar{f},U,a) $$ The winding number inherits many of the nice properties of the topological degree : being locally constant on the codomain, homotopy invariance, being $0$ for points outside of $\bar{f}(\bar{U})$ and others. More importantly, the smooth version of the topological degree can be recovered from this notion of a winding number. 

The Fourier transform is defined in at least 3 different ways depending on which subject and school one comes from: $$ \hat{f}(\xi)=\int_{\mathbb{R}^n} f(x)e^{-2\pi ix\cdot\xi}dx $$ or $$ \hat{f}(\xi) = \int_{\mathbb{R}^n} f(x)e^{-ix\cdot\xi}dx $$ or $$ \hat{f}(\xi) = \frac{1}{(2\pi)^{\frac{n}{2}}}\int_{\mathbb{R}^n} f(x)e^{-ix\cdot\xi}dx $$ The second definition is no longer an unitary operator on $L^2(\mathbb{R}^n)$ and loses the usual symmetry with the inverse, both of which are however rectified again by the third definition. 

Currently I'm using the notation $R\rangle X\langle$, resp. $R\rangle X,Y\langle$, as I need to distinguish between the latter and $R[S,T]$ and $R\langle X,Y\rangle$. But it looks... odd and I have no desire to introduce possibly non-standard notation. Another possibility is to use $\langle R,X\rangle$ (since the elements are words), but it is not particularly suggestive of what's supposed to be a ring of polynomials and reminds more of other things (it's unfortunately overused notation). Moreover, I imagine such rings have been well studied in the literature, but I was unable to locate them (one usually finds only the $R\langle X,Y\rangle$-type). 

For instance, in $\mathbb{R}^2$ the classical winding number $w(\gamma,a)$ would correspond to $w(\gamma,C_\varepsilon(a))$ for a small circle around $a$. (It's perhaps that second argument that should always be homotopy-invariant?) *a cat: NORTH AMERICAN informal (especially among jazz enthusiasts) a man. 

If $F:V\to W$ is a smooth at $a\in V$ function between finite-dimensional vector spaces over $\mathbb{R}$, then we have $$ F(x) = \sum_{k=0}^N\frac{1}{k!}(D^kF)(a)[(x-a)^{\otimes k}]+\text{remainder}, $$ where $(D^kF)(a):\mathrm{Sym}^k(V)\to W$ are $\mathbb{R}$-linear maps. Algebraically, this is a statement about writing tuples of homogeneous polynomials of same degree as a multilinear map, whose coefficients are the respective mixed partial derivatives (at $a$). Now, let $R$ be a commutative ring, in which $k!$ are invertible. I would like to be able to reference the analogous statement about the formal Taylor expansion at $0$ of tuples of formal power series $F:=(F_1,\dots,F_n)\in R[[X_1,\dots,X_m]]^n$ (or equivalently, tuples of polynomials). This seems like a completely standard fact, but I have not been able to pinpoint it in the literature. I am also curious, is there a workaround statement in the case that $1/k!$ don't exist in $R$ (e.g. if $R$ has positive characteristic)? 

Let $\mathbb{K}$ be either $\mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{C}$ and let $N\geq 2$. Similarly to the construction of the Zariski topology, take the collection of zero sets of $\mathbb{K}$-analytic functions to be the system of closed sets for a topology on $\mathbb{K}^N$. 

Too long for a comment... If I am not mistaken, the last (=6th) edition of Yosida's Functional Analysis is from 1995, so it seems you want something not older than that. Here is a list: 

Please note that the focus of the question is really finite-dimensional commutative associative real or complex unital algebras. Thank you! 

I am reading Shurygin's survey "Smooth Manifolds over Local Algebras and Weil Bundles" (Journal of Math. Sciences, Vol. 108, No. 2, 2002) and it mentions the following basic fact which I don't quite understand: 

Out of sheer curiosity I have been reading Stewert and Tall's "Algebraic Number Theory and Fermat's Last Theorem" (2001). As it contains various bits of history, I found out to my own shame that I was not even aware of the fact that there was another serious attack at FLT in the 80s - that of Y. Miyaoka. Now, we usually don't pay much attention to purported proofs from cranks and obvious amateurs of famous open conjectures, but since this came from a serious mathematician, the issues with his attempted proof can only be instructive in terms of learning value. It is a good thing to learn not only from one's own mistakes but from the mistakes of others too. So I started searching for more information, but to my surprise (and perhaps understandably) I have not been able to find any details for the past day (except that the author used techniques from Differential Geometry, which is still way too generic). Hence my question: 

Marsden, Ratiu, Abraham - Manifolds, Tensor Analysis, and Applications: lecture notes from 2007 available online, it has a full chapter on differential calculus in Banach Spaces Dineen S.- Complex Analysis on Infinite-Dimensional Spaces (1999) Fleming, Jamison - Isometries on Banach Spaces Vol.1 Function Spaces (2003) and Vol.2 Vector-Valued Function Spaces (2008) Michor, Kriegl - The Convenient Setting of Global Analysis (1997): it has two chapters on differential calculus in Banach Spaces IIRC. Omori H.- Infinite-Dimensional Lie Groups (revised,1997): first chapter is about infinite-dimensional calculus. Lang's books Fundamentals of Differential Geometry (2001) and Differential and Riemannian Manifolds (3ed.,1995) have the first chapter dedicated to differential calculus in TVS. Fabian M.- Functional analysis and infinite dimensional geometry (2001) Tsoy-Wo Ma - Classical Analysis on Normed Spaces (1995) 

I am surprised no one has mentioned yet Sergei Winitzki's "Linear Algebra via Exterior Products". It does exactly what the OP asks (and much more, incl. Hodge star). IMHO, it is an excellent second course in Linear Algebra and a good preparation for Differential Geometry. 

Wikipedia gives the following explicit formula for the functional calculus of $2\times2$ matrices: $$ f(A) = \frac{f(\lambda_+) + f(\lambda_-)}{2} I + \frac{\mathrm{tr}(A)/2 - \mathrm{adj}(A)}{\sqrt{\Delta(A)}} \frac{f(\lambda_+) - f(\lambda_-)}{2}, $$ where I am guessing that $\mathrm{tr}(A)/2 - \mathrm{adj}(A)$ actually means $(\mathrm{tr}(A)/2) I - \mathrm{adj}(A)$ and $\mathrm{adj}(A)$ stands for the adjugate of $A$ and where $\Delta(A)=(\mathrm{tr}(A)/2)^2 - \mathrm{det}(A)$ is the discriminant of the characteristic polynomial $\chi_A(t)=\mathrm{det}(tI-A)=t^2-\mathrm{tr}(A)t+\mathrm{det}(A)$ and $\lambda_\pm = \mathrm{tr}(A)/2 \pm \sqrt{\Delta(A)}$ are its roots. Unfortunately, the Wikipedia article is rather cryptic in this place without listing any assumptions whatsoever, and I have not been able to locate the formula in either Higham's book or in Bhatia's. 

Here are 3 references that haven't been mentioned yet. I am not sure if the latter two would be of any use to you, but probably are worth a look. 

$X$ is connected if and only if $A$ cannot be written as a Cartesian product $A_1\times A_2$ for nontrivial $A_1$ and $A_2$. So, that gives you some description of $A$ (but I don't know if it is any useful to you). 

Relation between irreducible and connected: hyperconnected always implies connected for set-theoretical topological reasons. Since you've imposed the Noetherian condition in your edit, for the inverse implication it suffices to additioinally assume that $X$ is smooth, that is, $A$ is a regular ring. I don't know if there is a more general condition that yields the inverse implication. 

I am mainly interested in the complex case, but I have also included the real-analytic case for completeness. Note that in dimension $N=1$ the answer is clearly yes, since the non-trivial closed sets are then precisely the countable discrete subsets of $\mathbb{K}$. Also, trivially, a positive answer in the real case in dimension $2N$ would imply a positive answer in the complex case in dimension $N$ ($N\geq 2$). 

Let $k$ be a field or a commutative ring with unit and let $F:M_n(k)\to M_n(k)$ be a $k$-linear map. Suppose that $F$ is given in the form $F(X) = A_1XB_1 + \cdots + A_m X B_m$ for some $A_i,B_i\in M_n(k)$ (note that any $k$-linear $F$ can be written in this form, though not uniquely). 

=============================================================== EDIT: To answer OP's last edit. $L^p$-spaces of vector-valued functions are treated for example in Vol.2 of Fleming and Jamison's Isometries on Banach Spaces. More generally, if OP is interested in vector-valued measures, here are some classical references: 

I've always been secretly fascinated with the rich structure and applications of finite-dimensional associative unital algebras over complete fields. In particular, I am very much interested in the structure and representations of commutative ones and their central extensions. My background is number theory, but I am somewhat ashamed to admit that I know very little about these objects as a whole and that little knowledge is rather scattered in bits and pieces one picks up from algebraic geometry, Lie theory, and google... I will try to make my inquiry as specific as possible: 

Here is a little bit of curiousity that's been itching me, let's hope it doesn't get me killed, meow. 

I always thought it would be nice to have a real-time virtual blackboard (supporting digitizer pen), say, as an extension of Skype or similar service, where you can not only talk with a colleague but also do math together over great distances. 

I am not entirely sure on the policy of answering one's own question, I am posting this for the sake of completeness and closure for anyone who might be interested in the same question. Following Ofir Gorodetsky's observation above, let is denote by $$ h_k := h_k(X_1,\dots,X_n) := \sum_{1\leq i_1\leq i_2\leq\dots\leq i_k\leq n}X_{i_1}X_{i_2}\dots X_{i_k} $$ $$ \sigma_k := \sigma_k (X_1,\dots,X_n) := \sum_{1\leq i_1< i_2<\dots< i_k\leq n}X_{i_1}X_{i_2}\dots X_{i_k},\ \sigma_0 := 1 $$ the complete homogeneous symmetric polynomials and the elementary symmetric polynomials in $n$ variables respectively. We have the following fundamental relation (which can be found for example in Stanley's Enumerative Combinatorics Vol.2): Lemma: $\forall m\geq 1$: $$ \sum_{\ell=0}^{m}(-1)^{m-\ell} \sigma_{m-\ell} h_\ell = 0 $$ In particular, we have the recursion $\forall m\geq 0$: $$ h_{m+1} = - \sum_{\ell=0}^m (-1)^{m-\ell+1}\sigma_{m-\ell+1}h_\ell,\ h_0 = 1 $$ $\square$ As a corollary of this, if $\theta_1,\dots,\theta_n$ are the roots of the minimal polynomial $\mu$, we obtain the following recursive relation: $$ h_{m+1}(\theta_1,\dots,\theta_n) = -\sum_{\ell=0}^m c_{n-m-1+\ell} h_\ell(\theta_1,\dots,\theta_n),\ h_0(\theta_1,\dots,\theta_n) = 1, $$ which we are going to use to prove the next Claim: We have $\forall m\geq 0$: $$ \theta^{n+m} = -\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}\left(\sum_{\ell=0}^m c_{k-m+\ell} h_\ell \right)\theta^k $$ Proof: Induction on $m$. The cases $m=0$ and $m=1$ are known from Dirk Liebhold's answer. Now suppose the claim is true for $m$. We calculate: $$ \theta^{n+m+1} = -\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}\left(\sum_{\ell=0}^m c_{k-m+\ell} h_\ell\right)\theta^{k+1} = -\sum_{k=1}^{n-1}\left(\sum_{\ell=0}^m c_{k-1-m+\ell} h_\ell\right)\theta^k -\left(\sum_{\ell=0}^m c_{n-1-m+\ell}h_\ell \right)\left(-\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}c_k\theta^k\right) = \sum_{k=0}^{n-1}\left(\sum_{\ell=0}^m \left(c_k c_{n-1-m+\ell}-c_{k-1-m+\ell}\right)h_\ell \right)\theta^k, $$ where we have used that $c_{k-1-m+\ell}=0$ for $k=0$ and $0\leq\ell\leq m$. Therefore it suffices to show that $\forall 0\leq k\leq n-1$: $$ \sum_{\ell=0}^m \left(c_k c_{n-1-m+\ell}-c_{k-1-m+\ell}\right) h_\ell = -\sum_{\ell=0}^{m+1} c_{k-m-1+\ell} h_\ell $$ We compute the difference of both terms: $$ c_k h_{m+1} + \sum_{\ell=0}^m c_{k-m-1+\ell} h_\ell + \sum_{\ell=0}^m c_k c_{n-1-m+\ell} h_\ell - \sum_{\ell=0}^m c_{k-1-m+\ell} h_\ell = c_k \Bigg(h_{m+1} + \underbrace{\sum_{\ell=0}^m c_{n-1-m+\ell} h_\ell}_{=-h_{m+1}}\Bigg)=0 $$ $\square$
