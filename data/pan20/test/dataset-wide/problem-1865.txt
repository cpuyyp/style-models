Generally this would be a huge no-no as this could lead to sexual harassment suits in some cases though there are some exceptions as I'd imagine in the adult film industry such topics may be about business. I'd likely consider asking if the colorful language is common or not as there is a chance it could be that within the specific industry you work these lines get used. I could imagine jokes being made about who has who by the balls or other slang that may be a common response. There can be something to be said for how graphic are things on one level. 

The other person is replaced for that event. You'd still go and have someone else be the replacement for that person who you want to avoid. You get replaced for that event. Someone else and the person you want to avoid go to the event. Nothing changes and you get to see how it is working with this person now where things may or may not be different. 

I'd likely be tempted to find a way to frame your concerns in a reasonable manner and check with your manager if you're doing OK in the role from management's perspective and what key areas would they want you to improve as perhaps they may think other things are where improvement would be better. 

Yes, though this is partially learning about how things are done and what kinds of adjustments could be made. Some places may need some fresh blood to get things flowing well again and others may be places that are fine. 

No, it is not an absolute no-go. The workspace belongs to the company, and they decide how to use it. However, it is not a decision for you to make unless the company has authorized you. You deciding to take his workspace unilaterally and your colleague's overreaction to it both lead to bad vibes in the workplace. To avoid creating an unnecessary confrontation, you could simply ask the coworker before taking his workspace. 

I have been pestered with similar job referral requests by an annoying interesting college acquaintance whom I didn't want to work with. I eventually figured out that the trick was not to respond with either no1 or yes, but to give an ambiguous reply to procrastinate the response forever, like this: 

I wholly agree with Philip Kendall's answer, and I would like to add an alternative approach to implement his solution. In your status report to team B manager, report the estimated time to support team A and highlight how it would affect your team B tasks. "Task Foo takes me two weeks of effort, but I expect about 50% time spent supporting team A's code walkthrough, so I will be done in 4 weeks. If you think that is an issue, I would need some help to reduce my involvement with team A." Two things could happen: 

What your employees (present or former) write in their resume is not your problem. If they apply to a job with false data, it is their problem and the (prospective) employer's problem. Don't worry about it and don't tell them to fix their resume. The only two scenarios where you could do anything about it are: 

My suggestion is to consider having a meeting discussing expectations and how to ensure they are properly communicated. It would appear you got blindsided in the review which as much as that may suck, you have to decide to what extent do you think there is something that would take your side in this that would give you satisfaction. What are you prepared to try to do to fix this before the next review? To what extent are you aware of your own biases and subjective views on what was discussed with management? Have you tried seeing things from their view or do you have very little trust in them? There is the Dr. Phil question of, "Would you rather be right or be happy?" here where you seem to want to be right without realizing the other side of the fence here. 

No, in giving notice you secure the end point and then work toward it. I'm not sure I see how this is an uncertain environment for two weeks instead of one unless you have some condition that makes you not regularly come to work or something. If a person regularly goes to work and works their time then this gives clarity as to how long is that person around and what is needed before that person moves on to the next contract. What is uncertain during that final week or two? 

The CTO/VP of a startup that I'm currently in, called a previous employee that recently left the company "an idiot who quits on projects and has no social skills" and added a few more negative things that I won't disclose. He said this in the company's public chat. I found this astonishing and very disrespectful as the guy was the lead engineer and has been in the company 1.5 years. For me this looks like a giant red flag and that I should leave this company asap. Or am I overreacting here? 

I've been working full-time remotely for a company in US for +2 months and they've been working on getting a work permit for me and it might be ready a week or two before Christmas holidays. So far the company has been saying that I'll relocate as soon as the work permit is ready. The company will close it's operations from Dec 24 to Jan 4. If the permit is ready a week or two before Dec 24 it leaves me in a rather awkward situation where I leave my relatives and family on a short notice just before Christmas and the company won't be working during holidays anyway. Would it be appropriate to ask to move the relocation date? Edit: please note that I'm currently located in Europe and relocation will cost a huge fortune. So it's not an option to relocate and move back for holidays. 

In the early years of my career, I used to have a similar anxiety when communicating with my American colleagues. I got over it in a few months because of: 

Tell the meeting organizer that the meeting time goes outside your working hours, and work with them to find a better time. It is likely they don't realize this time could be a problem for you, or didn't consider the local time in your timezone. If you tell them about the problem, they may try to figure out another time or move their other commitments. If you don't ask, you don't get. I have been in this situation where I was the only Indian team member (as well as the most junior) in a weekly status meeting that had all the other participants from US and Germany. I told them that since this is going to be a regular meeting, it would be inconvenient for me to stay in the office until 10PM. They were kind enough to move the meeting to a few hours earlier, so the US folks would have to wake up early and the German folks would delay their lunch break. Anyway, the answer to your question is, walking out of a meeting as soon as your working hours are done is not unprofessional per se, but people may perceive you to be a clock-watcher, which is a somewhat career-limiting perception. Moreover, if it is a one-off meeting, using flexitime (if available) is a more practical alternative. Being assertive in raising your issues and getting them resolved is always a better option than just walking away from the issue. 

I'd ask if this is to be filled in with words, signed with your initials, signed with your name, checked off or something else as each could make sense there. Some places may want initials or name so that you can be identified as having known the piece. Check marks could be used as a way of noting that piece. There could also be that nothing is to be done unless you have a problem with some piece of it. 

For an initial interview, I can see plenty of logic in meeting at a Starbucks or somewhere public so that there can be some form of screening beyond a phone screen. The idea here is to get an idea of your style and what kind of persona would bring. In some ways the key here is to see if you fit culturally as others have mentioned. Think of this as a basic test to see if you are OK to let into the office and meet others. There can be the interesting notes about social etiquette in this setting. For example, do you get a snack and drink here that costs a lot or do you take nothing and go right into an interview mode? How do you handle other people being around? How do you deal with a busy place versus a quiet office? There can be some tests that some could see as stressful as well as how well do you uphold confidentiality in a public setting. My personal take is to have whatever kind of regular beverage you'd usually have as this may be seen as setting a precedent. How big of an issue is it that it takes you 30 seconds to say what your order would be? This can be interesting. My typical Starbucks beverage would be a "Triple Venti Caramel Macchiato" which likely isn't that bad. As for why this place, that can be a good question though the key is to consider how you are framing the question. "Why in the world would you choose this place?" could be seen as a bit dramatic though there could well be various explanations to consider not the least of which is how do you know this person isn't going to do something horrible? The only tweak to make in the interview preparation is to be aware of what is available at the coffee shop that you may want as well as what time of day would you be having this food. In most cases, I don't think it would be judged though if you ordered a handful of snacks at a Starbucks for a 10:30 am meeting, that may raise an eyebrow from the interviewer wondering, "Are you trying to freeload me here? Why would you need to eat that many snacks at this hour?" or something similar. 

He has replied with the same analysis and the same solutions that I emailed him! I am not sure if he has actually read my mail completely, or just jumped into the problem on reading the first line. I am more concerned about whether he realized the part about the solutions being against the project guidelines. I cannot share more details of the issue, but it is easy to miss that these solutions are against the guidelines unless someone spends some time to realize what is going on. Hence, I can see two possibilities in this case: 

Answer the question honestly. You should not look at an interview like an exam, where you give the "right" answers to the questions asked. The recruiter probably doesn't even have an expected answer in mind, and genuinely wants to hear you. Making up an answer to match what the interviewer may want to hear makes the exercise useless for both parties. They want to know how you want to grow, not whether you will say you want to grow in the way you think they want you to. 

This would ensure that you don't look like an idiot even if you were supposed to work on task X, since you could just respond with the status. It would also avoid the current situation, where she looks like an idiot. Even better, she could have asked you the status in person or over phone/skype, and avoided putting dozens of stakeholders in cc, which only makes it look like a big deal. Nonetheless, be the bigger person, and don't get into a mudslinging match with her. My preferred approach would be to talk to her and explain why task X was put on hold/cancelled and then send a polite "as discussed" mail as other answers suggest. With this approach, you can avoid further back and forth over email, which would happen in case she has additional questions. The dozens of stakeholders in cc aren't interested in knowing who was right, they will instead take notice of the communication problems within the team.
