Throughout history, the details of military technology have driven tactics. Often we end up with what might be called a "classic tactic". I'm thinking of things like: In the age of sailing ships, the classic tactic was "crossing the T": maneuver so that the broad side of your ship is facing the enemy's bow or stern, so that you can fire with a large number of guns while he can only fire with one or two. With fighter aircraft, the classic tactic is "stay on his tail": position yourself directly behind the enemy, so that your relative velocity is as small as possible and you can easily see him while he has difficulty seeing you, and as most weapons fire forward you can shoot at him but he can't shoot at you. With muskets, the classic tactic was "the line", or for the British who carried this tactic to its limits, "the thin red line": Form your troops into a long line and fire simultaneous volleys, so that even though your weapons are horribly inaccurate you send a wall of lead at the enemy and have a good chance of hitting SOMETHING. Etc. So we generally suppose that future military spacecraft will use missiles and/or lasers or some other sort of beam weapon. What would be the "classic tactic" of such ships? Anything more interesting than "start shooting once you get in range"? 

I agree that it would make sense to use a decimal clock. I'd say use the standard metric divisions and prefixes: a day is divided into 10 decidays, or 100 centidays, or 1000 millidays, etc. Computations involving time would be simpler. I'd quibble that your statement that 1 hour is too long and 1 minute is too short is na√Øve. It depends what we're trying to measure. Sure, 1 minute is too small a unit to conveniently describe a work day. (Sadly enough.) But it's a very handy unit to measure how long it takes to boil noodles or brush your teeth. That said, getting people to change would be a huge task. People are used to the present system. They have a "feel" for how long an hour is and how long a minute is. Switching to a new unit would require re-learning. All the clocks would have to be redesigned. (Actually I guess clock manufacturers would love it, as everyone would have to buy new clocks.) Every reference to time in instruction manuals and legal documents would have to be changed. It would be a huge amount of work and expense. I doubt people would do it. I've often observed that when I was in high school and college and was taking science classes, the metric system was obviously superior, and I couldn't understand why the U.S. did not switch. Then I graduated school and I rarely do calculations with physical units any more. Oh, I care how far away the next highway exit is and how many quarts of oil to put in the back-up generator, but I rarely do CALCULATIONS with units, so which system I use doesn't matter all that much. And by the way, if you did switch to this system, you'd still have those insane people who say we need to add leap seconds to the calendar to keep it in sync with variations in the rotation of the Earth. As if having the sun rise at 6:28:02 instead of 6:28:01 like it was this day last year is a bigger problem than having essentially random and unpredictable changes to your clock. 

Short answer: No. Elements are identified by their atomic number, i.e. the number of protons in the nucleus. When Mendeleev invented the periodic table, there were a number of holes. For example, there was no known element between Calcium, atomic number 20, and Titanium, number 22. Mendeleev therefore proposed the existence of new, previously unknown elements. He predicted properties of these elements based on where they would fit in his periodic table. When these elements were found and indeed did have the properties he predicted, this was strong evidence that the theory behind his periodic table was correct. (Note: Mendeleev built his table using atomic weights rather than atomic numbers, so his methods were not quite as rigorous as we have today. But that's a side point.) Today we have identified elements for every possible atomic number from 1 (Hydrogen) to 118 (tentatively named ununoctium). That is, we know elements 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, etc, every possible integer up to 118. So any unknown elements must have atomic numbers higher than 118. All known elements with atomic numbers 84 or higher (84=Polonium) are radioactive and unstable. As Jim2B mentions, some physicists theorize that there may be stable elements with higher atomic numbers, but no such elements have ever been found in nature or synthesized in the lab, so at this point it's all theory. 

Are you ruling out civilian casualties, or just ruling out annihilating a colony? Obvious possibilities: Tasers. Not going to destroy the city walls or cause casualties, but will disable opponents. Drawback: Only disables people for very short periods. Phasers set on stun. Okay, probably not going to happen in this time frame. Rubber bullets. Like tasers, probably not effective enough. Weapons that fire poison darts. Such weapons aren't in general use because if you want to kill somebody, a conventional gun is cheaper and more effective. But they're around. Spies use them occasionally, etc. Poison gas. Oh, like poison darts, the nature of the gas is debatable. Does it kill, incapacitate, render unconscious, etc? Any of those would work. Something that makes people too sick to fight for a few days is probably enough to let you take over the city and throw the die-hards into prison camps. But it seems to me there's a big problem with the premise: If the Rules of War in this culture rule out blowing holes in a city's pressure wall, how do the attackers get inside to use their less-destructive weapons? Couldn't the defenders of a city just close all the airlocks? Or even if the attackers can break open the airlocks, so they come through these narrow openings where the defenders can be waiting for them and pick them off one by one. I'd say the more likely scenario is: We don't try to restrict the types of weapons. Rather, we agree that all colonies are "open cities". That is, all combat is conducted out in the "wilds". If you break through the enemy armies and reach their city, the city opens its door and surrenders without a fight. The alternative is that you blow a whole in their pressure wall and they all die. Many places in history have adopted this policy to minimize civilian casualties. It works as long as both sides respect it. Which, admittedly, is an iffy thing. 

Of course the reason why this happens in fiction is because you need danger or conflict to make a story interesting. Suppose you wrote a story that said, "We invented a robot to pick up the garbage and take it to the dump. It did this flawlessly for many years, picking up discarded newspapers and empty cans and rags and so on, until it finally broke down and had to be replaced". That would be pretty dull. But instead say "but by the definition we gave it of 'garbage', it decided that old family photos were garbage because they served no useful purpose ... then it decided that all fiction books were garbage ... then it decided that unemployed people were garbage ..." etc., now you have a story that could be a thoughtful discussion of how we define value, an action tale about fighting the evil machine with lots of explosions, etc. In real life ... well, there is no such thing as an AI of the sort that you're talking about in real life, so it's difficult to say how it would really work. Things we call "AI" today are limited to playing a particular game, or attempting to diagnose repair problems, that sort of thing. No one has created an AI that is capable of independent thought or creativity in anything like the human sense. Real AIs follow strict computer programs. They don't ask questions about the meaning of life or decide to take over the world unless they were programmed to do so. You can write science fiction stories about how the computer has gotten so complex and intelligent that it is now a "mind" in a sense very similar to human mind, but that's fiction, or at best speculation of what we might be able to build someday. I develop software for a living. I once wrote a computer game that had an AI for the player to compete against. It just doesn't work like you see in the movies. My game was about running for president. So it's not like I told the computer, "Figure out a strategy to get the most votes." The reality is that I had to come up with a mass of detailed rules. "Look at how many people in this state favor this policy position according to such-an-such a poll. Multiply the percentage by the number of electoral votes that state receives. Check how many of those voters now say they will vote for our candidate after our last TV ad. Divide the cost of the ad by the number of voters. Add ..." etc. And bear in mind that even that description is "humanizing" the computer. A more precise description would be to say that I create a variable called x, and that the computer reads track 20, sector 4, byte 12 from the hard drive, and copies that value into x, and then I create another variable y, and the computer adds x and y to get z, etc. The computer has no idea what any of this "means", it just knows to add these two numbers, check if this number is greater than that number, detect which keys the user has pressed on the keyboard, set this particular dot on the screen to this color, etc. An AI may do something "unpredictable" in the sense that following all these rules and doing all these calculations gives a result that you didn't expect. Computers very often are "unpredicatable" in the sense that they don't do what we intended because we made a programming error. But they are not "unpredictable" in the sense of coming up with an original idea that the programmers never thought of and never programmed into them. Will people someday invent a true Artificial Intelligence, in the sense of being a true independently thinking and creative being, able to make subjective decisions, moral choices, etc? Maybe. I certainly am not prepared to say it's impossible. But if we do, this will have little to do with current technology. It will not be one more step from where we are now; it will be a totally new development. Sure, you could program an AI to make decisions about who gets what medical care, like someone brought up in another answer. But it's not like you would just tell the computer, "Figure out who should get medical care by comparing cost to quality of life". Rather, you would have to have detailed rules, like "Take the list of procedure codes entered into the system by the doctor. Look up the cost of each procedure in the medical procedures database and calculate the total. Then calculate how much these procedures could be expected to extend the patient's life using this formula ..." etc. If the computer then decides to kill a patient, it's not because the computer ran amok. It's because the people who programmed the computer ran amok when they decided they had the right and the authority to make these decisions based on these formulas that they made up. AIs don't kill people. People kill people. :-) 

Assuming a materialist view of the mind, i.e. that brain equals mind, and there is no such thing as a soul: I'd think the answer would be obviously "yes", at least in principle. You could do something like an MRI scan of a person's brain, determine the exact position of every cell, exact parameters of every electrical charge, etc. Then code this information like you were going to store it on a computer. Again, in principle, we could have a giant table: cell with this chemical contents at this location, electrical charge of this voltage at this point, etc. Once the information is on the computer, you code it into bits (or rather, at that points it's already coded into bits), and you send it by radio or laser. Then reconstruct it at the other end from this data. I note that it wouldn't be necessary to fully understand how the brain works to do this, it would just be necessary to be able to accurately identify all it's components. Like today, I can store a recording of someone playing the piano on my computer. I don't have to know which keys caused which sounds, or even which bits represent any given note. I just need a mechanism to convert sounds to bits and back again. Of course there's a big gap between "theoretically possible in principle" and "we'll start building the machine tomorrow". Assuming a non-materialist view: More iffy. What is the nature of the mind? What is the nature of the soul? If someday we developed technology to detect and measure a soul, then we're back to scenario 1. If that sounds crazy, I don't think it's any crazier than the idea of detecting and measuring electrical impulses in muscles would have seemed to someone in AD 1600. Maybe the soul is simply a form of energy that we presently don't understand, or something of that sort. Or, what if we could catalog every memory that a person has, every emotion, every thought, etc. and record it. If it could be recorded on a computer, it could be transmitted electronically or optically. I'm tempted to say that even under vitalist assumptions it would be theoretically possible. I don't claim to have any idea how to go about it with present technology.
