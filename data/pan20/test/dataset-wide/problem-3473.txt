Behavioral economics is distinct from technical analysis. The former is based on empirical data stemming from psychological study; the latter, off strict historical price data, and nothing else. In fact, the "founder" of technical analysis specifically said he wouldn't let any outside factors- anyone's mood, the weather, a catastrophe, etc.- get in the way of his analysis. 

Sadly, this is meaningless; simply because courses, journals, and practitioners exist for any given field doesn't validate that field. 

This question is more so geared toward anyone with research experience within economics, though of course, anyone is welcome to respond. I'm an undergraduate math major with a minor in economics. I'd like to know which textbooks are decent for introducing one to research methods in economics? Graduate level is fine, perhaps even preferred. If a student was to take his research to "the next level" (publishing worthy), which textbooks would provide the rigor and insight to develop said research? Also, any introductory recommendations for econometrics? Thank you in advance. ANNENDUM: From the limit experience I have in economics, I've found the following areas to fascinate me on multiple occasions (in no particular order): 

Game theory Macroeconomics (monetary policy) Microeconomics (i.e., commodity pricing) Pricing theory 

The answer to this question carries a survivorship and success bias; you're much more likely to hear from traders whose luck turned out well with technical analysis, rather than traders who haven't done too well. For success bias: suppose you had 10 traders who did well/poorly with technical analysis strategies. That doesn't really prove anything. Some really long and detailed studies have shown that tech analyst traders haven't really outperformed anyone. 

I believe the question is easy to understand, but I'm unsure of the methodology to collect proper and relevant data to solve the question. The answer, I'm sure, is a bit complicated. Though I'm not completely certain, I suspect the relationship is such that time, $t$, is a function of the change in price, $\Delta P$, of a given item (i.e.,$\quad f:\Delta P \rightarrow t).$ The price change could be relative or absolute. There might be a schedule of different coefficients, depending on the price bracket of different items. For example, one class would include items that many households could afford on a weekly basis (video games, books, t-shirts, etc.), while another class would include items that the average household doesn't buy every week or year (refrigerators, cars, overseas vacations, etc.), and another class would include luxurious items that only the top 2-5% percentile of income earners could afford (court-side tickets to a basketball game, a Ferrari, a bottle of Dom Perignon, etc). So here's my question to the community here: does anyone know of any study or previous work that addresses this question? If not, does anyone know how I could go about researching this topic? I guess "SurveyMonkey" would be one route, but it seems like a daunting task, considering how many variables I might have to account for. 

In a framework such as CAPM, agents are assumed to be rational, and usually to have identical preferences. All agents have access to the same information, and agree on the level of riskiness of every particular stock. As returns are a reward for taking risk, the price of every asset do not depend on the supply but on its riskiness. Thus, the demand curve is flat: no matter how much of asset A their is on the market, nobody wants to pay a premium which would lead to have a lower reward for a same level of risk. This models have very strong and restrictive assumptions, which is why we end up with this weird infinitely price-elastic demand curve. More complex models, with less restrictive assumptions, might produce downward sloping demand curves. 

Your analysis of what demand curve represents is correct. Your confusion comes from the overly simplistic demand function that you chose. A "true" demand function would rather look like this: 

Another key feature of those shell companies is that they hide the ultimate beneficiary of the transactions. Banks, insurance companies and most financial services firm must make enquiries as part of the "Know Your Customer" (KYC) regulations: they should be able to find out who will benefit ultimately from the transactions, or in the name of whom they are carried out. THeoretically (ate least in the EU), if they fail to identify an ultimate beneficiary, they should refuse to carry out the transaction AND warn the responsible authority (typically the local equivalent or representative of the FATF - Financial Action Task Force) But a succession of shell companies in different countries, in particular in countries which apply a strict confidentiality of the investors of a company, make it very hard to be sure that the beneficiary identified is indeed the ultimate beneficiary. Thus, those shell companies also serve the purpose to hide their owner to their counterparts. This feature is most appreciated for tax evasion and money laundering (obvisouly). 

We need to distinguish two things here: the intrinsic value of the assets, and their fair value, or market value. No matter how much the price of an asset changes on financial markets (say, stock exchanges), its intrincic value stays the same, all other things equals. Typically, you could use the cost of the asset to assess its intrinsic value: for a house, the price of its construction. For a share, the book value per share of the underlying firm. For bonds, the nominal (or face value) amount. But assessing cost is sometimes tricky. The book value might incorporate things that are valued at fair value. For real estate, the price of the land is a large part of the total cost, and it changes all the time. For bonds, you could incorporate interests and discount them, but you need to choose a discount rate. Thus we typically assess wealth using fair value. It's a concept precisely defined by IFRS (IFRS 13 - Fair value measurement). Basically, the fair value of an asset is the price at which you could sell it under normal market conditions ('at arm's length'). It is true 'value', as you could trade the asset against that amount of cash. To come back to your question: wealth is measured at fair value, or market value. Therefore, the $34.4bn were indeed destroyed, or disappeared, even though the intrinsic value may have been constant. Your second suggestion is correct. 

Revenue is similar to this except it does not take into account the cost of production. So if my total revenue is \$100 and selling the next unit would get me to \$105 total revenue, my marginal revenue for that unit was \$5. Regardless of how much the next unit cost to produce. 

You could represent the game in simultaneous form (matrix) to see all possible equilibria. If there is only one, then that's your subgame-perfect Nash equilibrium (since there are no other equilibria). If there are multiple equilibrias in the simultaneous representation, the extensive form allows you to see if some paths would never be reached given the structure of the game. Essentially, the extensive form "proves" which paths would never be reached through ruling them out. The one path that is reached is your SPNE. An SPNE has a more strict definition. There is really no shortcut around the arithmetic in the extensive form since the definition of SPNE forces you to check for the one viable path. 

In a world where one unit of X good is sold, it would go to the highest bidder. The second unit would go to the second highest bidder and would cost more to produce (marginally) than the last unit. If you carry this logic forward, at some point the next unit's marginal benefit (to the consumer) will be equal to the marginal cost (to the producer)**. The last consumer flipped a coin when purchasing since she got the same profit from purchasing and not purchasing. Similarly, the producer also was indifferent between producing and not producing the last unit. What if we supply ONE MORE unit than the equilibrium price? It would mean that the marginal cost exceeds the marginal benefit. The world and the individuals transacting are worse off after this transaction because the costs exceeded the benefit. This is known as dead weight loss. Marginal benefit: 

How would the welfare analysis of a military draft look? My intuition tells me that it would look similar to a price ceiling below the equilibrium, with the exception that suppliers (civilians) are forced to supply the draft. So we supply beyond P* x Q* and all the way out to the intersection of the demand curve and P-draft. If we say that consumer surplus is the area above P-draft and below the demand curve, then how would we interpret the area that isn't our typical DWL? The area above P-draft, below the demand curve, and above the supply curve. 

Your equation is sufficient to study what happens in the middle of the curve, but not on the tails. The upper tails has such form that you would actually purchase some units even if price goes up a lot. But the more it goes up, the less your demanded quantity changes. That is because the product has some utility to you, so you are willing to pay a relatively high price for one unit of it. But then, the lower the price, the more you could buy. But the more units you buy, the fewer utility it brings to you. While you might really enjoy eating an apple, I bet that the 100th will not taste as great as the first one, and you might be disgusted. That's why the curve does not go to infinity when the price is zero. Reaching a certain point, your demand for apple doesn't grow anymore. 

How can the bond market be overvalued? To value a bond, you need, as you mention, to discount future cash flows. The cash flows (or coupons) are fixed, but the discount rate is not, and every investor may have a different view on interest rates and hence price bonds differently. Therefore, someone thinking that interest rates will remain at rock-bottom levels will find different prices for bonds from someone who thinks that interest rates will rise sharply in the near future (the first investor will find higher prices). So, in your case, someone thinking that the bond market is overvalued simply has a different view on interest rates than the consensus on the market. To be more precise, they expect interest rates to increase faster than the market consensus. Bond Prices and interest rates Taking into account what we have said above, you can view the bond market as follows: every investor forms a view on discount rates, for a given bond. Doing so, they actually compute the yield, that is the discount rate that makes the NPV of the cash flows of the bond equal to 0. However, investors disagree on where the yield should be. They will thus trade the bond between them until they all agree. Let's take a numerical example : - Investor A owns a Bond, which has a face value of 100, a coupon of 1 and will mature in one year. - Investor A thinks that the yield of this bond should be 2% - Investor B thinks that the yield of this bond should be 0.5% The value of this Bond to Investor A is : $(100 + 1) / 1.02 = 99.02$ The value of this Bond to Investor B is : $(100 + 1) / 1.005 = 100.50$ Therefore investor A and Investor B will both improve their current state by trading the bond anywhere between \$99 and \$100.5, ie. Investor A should sell the Bond to Investor B. If the market price of the bond is \$100, then Investor A thinks that the bond is overvalued, and Investor B thinks that the bond is undervalued.
