Generally, food storage is located in rooms in a castle or other fortified building because otherwise bandits and neighboring feudal lords would steal it and everyone in the victimized fiefdom would die. Grain storage is usually in a tower-like silo or other granary. Root vegetables are stored in cellars (often called root cellars or dugouts). Preserved meats, seeds, and picked goods are stored in storage rooms or small warehouses. Hay and other cattle feed is stored in barns or stables, often in tied hay bales or barrels or casks. You might want to look at architectural drawings for medieval castles and manorial estates to get a feel for what these areas were called, and how many of each were present. But, keep in mind that in most medieval settings that food storage was not very viable for many kinds of foods. Many communities lacked any capacity to freeze or refrigerate food produced in warmer months (like fresh fruits, fresh vegetables and fresh meat) for the winter, hunting as well as gathering of edible plants was much less abundant in the winter, and caloric consumption typically went way down in the winter as people went a little hungry and tried to cope by being less active - a situation that continued through the spring when the first new crops would be available. Bread made from flour (that could be preserved and stored) in casks in a storage room or in part of the mill where it was ground; water; local alcoholic beverages in wooden or ceramic casks, in bottles, in leather skins, or in ceramic beakers; small portions of meat that could be preserved with salt or vinegar in barrels or ceramic or glass or leather containers, together with potatoes and onions stored loose in bins or fiber bags in a root cellar, and milk from dairy cows or goats that were kept in a barn (including cheese from their milk which lasts a little longer depending on how dry the cheese is) would typically be the main sources of winter food. Because food storage was poor, you tried to have kids in the spring so that infants would be mature enough not to die of malnourishment when winter arrived and reduced food for a breast feeding mother reduced nourishment available for the breast feeding child. 

Salem Witch Trials Early modern witch trials: "An estimated total of 40,000-60,000 people were executed during the witch trials." Modern witch-hunts: "While an unknown problem in vast parts of the Western population, body-counts of modern witch-hunts by far exceed those of early-modern witch-hunting." 

With current farming technology as actually practiced in the United States about 10 acres of land (40,000 square meters) is used to produce food for each average person. This itself represents are remarkable improvement in agricultural productivity in the last half century or so. 

I wanted to give some time for answers to percolate before providing any answer of my own, but I'd make a few observations, to ground the analysis, without really resolving some of the trickiest and most interesting parts of the question. Lots of a military force involves an Air Force and a Navy in addition to the Army. In 2015 in the U.S. military, the force structure was: 

The mostly likely of the proposals to work on the desired time frame would probably be to impact the surface of Venus with about 2000 large asteroids. 

The lords were allowed, but also required, to pass their land and the associated responsibilities to their eldest male heir at law and could not sell the land or freely transfer it. 

Terrestrial hunter-gatherers sometimes assembled in rich hunting grounds on a seasonal basis for a matter of a month or two, but almost never had sedentary communities, because their prey either migrated or would be exhausted by staying in one place for too long. In rare instances, permanent structures were built by these groups as temples or gathering places that were probably inhabited only seasonally, the most famous of which is the late Mesolithic Gobekli Tepe temple in Anatolia, shown at an advanced stage of construction but prior to completion: 

Shorter answer: No. Magnetic fields don't hold electrically neutral gases and almost all of the gases in the atmosphere except ozone are electrically neutral. You'd have to come up with some other solution. Now, if you are talking about "the Moon" rather than a moon, I'm not sure that the gravity is too low to support some sort of atmosphere under the right circumstances. The Moon still has one-sixth of Earth gravity and an escape velocity of 2.38 km/s v. 11.2 km/s for Earth. The moon has 85% of the gravity of Titan (which has a thick hydrocarbon atmosphere). Chris in a prior stack exchange post (shit my apologies, I closed it before getting the link) noted that: 

The Evolution of L1 and L2 After They Are In Contract Think more about L1 and L2 pre-contact, and an L1' evolved version of L1, and an N1 dialect of L2' post-contract, than about an L3. In real life, L2 experiences substrate influences from L1 especially during first 60 years or so; natives of N1 would speak L2 with a distinct dialect with somewhat simplified or non-L1-like grammar features of L2 that must be tolerated because adult learners can't learn it fluently en masse (think of people in India speaking English, or more obscurely a lot of Hattic phonetics ended up in the Indo-European Hittite language when Hittites conquered Anatolia). When they teach it to the next generation, because native L2 speakers aren't available, the dialect persists. Almost every language that expands into someplace that is not virgin territory shows substrate influences (including, for example, all major families of Indo-European languages from Greek to Celtic to French and the Berber languages). Conversely, languages with no contact with other languages in "virgin territory" for long periods of time remain very conservative and static, e.g. Icelandic is closest the original Germanic language called "Old Norse". Meanwhile, L1 also persists with some "Spanglish" type loan words until it and its culture completely loses socio-economic-culture value in the eyes of people descended from native L1 speakers. Religious uses in literate cultures stay most pure in L1 (see, e.g., Hattic, Latin, Sumerian, Hebrew) long after a language is otherwise dead, but lots of people lose L1 entirely (a la Gaelic in Ireland) after a few hundred years. What Components Are Likely To Change Every day words (like those in a Swadesh list) are more durable in the face of pressure on a language from competition, than more rarely used words especially those first encountered from N2 sources. Grammatical cores tends to be durable because it is hard to evolve piecemeal, although large numbers of language learners make languages get simpler in grammar even in the absence of a creole. Lexical items are easier to absorb. For example, English has borrowed gobs of words over time while evolving grammatically much less frequently and incrementally. When undisturbed however, or under substrate influences of adult language learners, grammar does evolve over time. Mixed languages in the examples cited in the question seem to tend to deal with grammar and lexicon by whole categories of word (two had L1 nouns and noun grammar and L2 verbs and verb grammar). If there was a mixed language mostly L1 grammar and 70%-80% L1 vocabulary (by proportion of words spoken in an average day, not dictionary count) would be closer to historical experience. Mixed Language Formation Is Unlikely In The Circumstances Of The Question L1 extinction and L3 formation are driven by more or less opposite forces. It would be rare for a true L3 that is a blend of languages to emerge unless L1 and L2 are almost perfect socio-economic equals (not this scenario). Each of the mixed languages noted in the original post is dying, despite being not very old as languages go, which is natural. Mixed languages tend to be a short lived transitional phenomena on frontiers where invader advantages are diminished vis-a-vis populations that would otherwise be crushed substrates. 

It would want its currency to be used widely. If its currency is used widely, then the community whose currency is being used is insulated against exchange rate risks that all other traders must bear in addition to the other risks that they face in the trading economy. Also, it could set its monetary policies to meet its own economic needs without regard to the macroeconomic impact that those monetary policies have on other economies that use but do not control that currency. For example, suppose that the issuing community reached a point where they owed a lot of debts denominated in their currency (both sovereign debts and private ones) relative to the debts that were owed to them denominated in their currency. The issuing community could produce more money leading to inflation and reduce the inflation adjusted economic burden associated with those debts. On the other hand, if the issuing community was primarily a lender vis-a-vis the outside world (e.g. the "Iron Bank" of the Game of Thrones world), it would want to manage its currency so as to prevent inflation or even to deflate its currency by keeping the amount of money in circulation steady or reducing the amount of money in circulation. Ideally, to gain this flexibility, the currency should be valued at a level significantly more than the intrinsic value of the materials in the coins, even if coins are still necessary because the concept of fiat money is not yet well understood. 

The relentless Spanish military and diplomatic efforts to undermine it seems to have been critical in Muskogee's collapse. So, one approach would be for Spain under what in real history was the reigns of Charles III and Charles IV to be otherwise occupied by some pressing concern that would cause it to divert resources away from Florida and towards more pressing demands elsewhere. There are several ways this could be achieved. What was going on in Spain at the time? 

Now not all plants are as efficient sources of protein in particular, or calories in general as soybeans, and eating soybeans all the time gets old (and doesn't supply all of the ammino acids needed to live by itself). But, it is fair to say that you could reduce the land footprint of the food an average person eats by about 45% (90% of the half from animals) by switching to an almost purely vegan diet. This is still a lot of farmland per person, about 5.5 acres per person (about 22,000 square meters). And, exactly how much improvement you could get with higher technology approaches like hydroponics, twenty-four hour grow lights and so on, isn't exactly clear. Assuming that an enclosed environment could at least match the peak productivity of cereal crops per land area relative to the U.S., it might be possible to reduce the amount of farmland per person required to a bit less than 2 acres per person (about 8,000 square meters, which is 125 people per square kilometer if one is answering the title question). Allegedly, hydroponic farming could significantly improve on even this 80% reduction from the status quo in food produced per acre, as the posts above note. But, estimates of 500-1000 square meters per person do seem unrealistic given current technology.
