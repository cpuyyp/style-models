Yep, first, of course, unscrew the little knob all the way. Then, before installing the pump chuck, press the knob in briefly to let out of burst of air and assure that the valve is not stuck closed. Also, when tightening the little knob tighten it only just barely finger tight -- don't try to get it super-tight. If you overtighten the valve you distort the rubber seal in the valve and shorten its life (in addition to making it more likely to stick). 

I used to have a bike with a good pump peg, so that my frame pump would stay put without a strap. When a dog got threatening I could reach down, grab the pump, and wave it at the dog. From the dog's point of view it was black and menacing (even though the thing was actually all lightweight plastic and aluminum and couldn't hurt a flea) -- a mean dog knows what a stick is and will stay a respectable distance away. Unfortunately, my current bike has no peg, and I must use a strap to hold the pump in place. Fortunately, I haven't had many run-ins with dogs of late. 

The reason #3 is a factor is that you jiggle as you ride, and that absorbs a lot of energy -- the more you jiggle, the more energy is required. You can reduce jiggle by using lower air pressure in the tires, but this increases tire/road friction. You can add front and/or rear suspension to reduce jiggle, but the suspension itself absorbs energy, plus it tends to make pedaling less efficient. So it's a tradeoff -- at some point in the transition between smooth and really rough roads it probably pays, in terms of energy efficiency, to unlock the shocks. 

If you have to make a choice, put the wider tire on the back. Generally there's more weight on the back, plus having the wider tire in front will make make steering more difficult. (Most likely the previous owner had to replace one of the tires and just used what was available.) 

It appears that one might possibly attach a lightweight trailer to that rack sort of deal on the back, or possibly to the seat stay. Since the thing has such a short wheelbase with the rider's weight so far backwards, there would be a bit of a problem with the bike doing a wheelie, however. 

Was getting a sort of rubbing sound from my front wheel, like rubbing brakes, but the sound continued even with the bridal loose. So I disassembled my front hub. Everything looked good until I got to the cones. One has a rather noticeable line worn by the balls (more so than I've seen on other bearings), and the other has what I would call a spalled spot in addition to the line, with a rough, wavy area for maybe 15 degrees of arc. The cups, on the other hand, look factory fresh. This is a Shimano RSX hub. Any idea what would cause this? The hub has 25-30K miles on it, but has been overhauled twice. The sound came up over a period of maybe 100-200 miles riding. I don't go off-road and I don't jump curbs. Anyway, since the cups look good and the rim probably still has another 10-20K of life left, I'm thinking of getting a new hub and just swapping the cones, vs replacing the hub or buying a new wheel. Any reason not to do this? More info: I took a closer look at the cones. One is not really that worn -- there's just a barely-perceptible mark from the balls, and I'd not suspect it at all if it weren't for the other cone. The other is spalled to one degree or another all around, however. And, oddly, the two cones are not identical. The "good" one has the plastic seal washers, while the "bad" one has no groove for seal washers. Clearly, one or the other (probably the "bad" one) has been replaced in one of the two bike shop overhalls. So the question is, why was the old cone replaced? Presumably it was spalled as well, so what could be causing one cone to spall? I haven't removed the dust caps, so I can't get a REAL good look at the cups, but will have a shot at it again, using a flashlight. But on my several inspections so far the cups look smooth and shiny. And I'm certain the balls were replaced the last time around. (Unfortunately, inspecting 18 tiny ball bearings is just about impossible.) Here are pictures: 

"Burrs on the hub" sounds bogus to me. Could be the case with a new hub, but burrs would be worn away with use. It seems most likely that the hub was reassembled by "unskilled labor" (the new/careless guy in the shop) and he didn't notice that the hub holes are directional -- there is a countersink on one side of the hole and not the other -- or didn't understand how you put spokes in such a hub. When the holes are directional, you put the head of the spoke on the non-countersunk side, so that the curve of the spoke mates with the smooth countersink. Placing spokes the opposite way will result in the curve of the spoke being against the sharp corner of the hole (and a broken spoke). To check this, look at any hole where a spoke is broken. If the two sides the hole are different, the side with the smooth rounded countersunk shape should be matched with the bend in the spoke, and the head should be on the other side. Another possibility is that machine spokes were used. These spokes have a longer distance between the head and the bend, to simplify things for lacing machines. But these are bad for hand lacing, as there is too much "lever arm" unsupported by the spoke hole, and the heads will tend to pop off. If such spokes are used one must use small spacer washers on the head side to pull the bend tightly to the curve of the spoke hole. Or, of course, they could be lousy spokes. (If they were breaking at the rim end this would be due to the way the rim is drilled and possible missassembly placing left-facing drilled holes with a right-facing spoke, or simply spokes that aren't strong enough to stand up to the stress of being slightly bent at the nipple.) 

The internal width is obviously one important feature. But for indexed shifting the ring has a pattern embossed on the side facing the smaller ring that catches the pins of the chain when shifting. The combo of the embossing depth/pattern and the ring-to-ring spacing affects what width chain (and brand chain) will work best with the ring. I've no idea what combos can be expected to work with what, though. I lost track when they went to 8 speeds, and now it's a total free-for-all. 

Certainly, old tires get stiffer as the rubber dries out, and this makes them harder to remove and install. But what you've probably experienced is the difference between brands and styles. Some tires are a hair oversize and slip onto the rim quite easily, while others are a hair undersize and are much more difficult to deal with. It's hard to predict which you will encounter unless you are familiar with the brands involved. (The leak you experienced after replacing the tube was probably due to damaging the tube while installing it. Unless you really have to, DO NOT use screwdrivers to lever the tire off/on, but use plastic "tire irons", or, better, a "Quick Stick" tire lever. Using screwdrivers frequently causes tube damage.) 

Approach at something close to a right angle. Easiest if the track is square to the road, of course. Only a little less easy if the track on the right-hand side (on US roads) is nearer than the left, so you can, in advance of your approach, swing out into the lane to achieve a square approach. Much trickier the other way -- you must wait for traffic behind to be clear so you can swing out into traffic as you cross. Approach at "moderate" speed (maybe 10 mph). For a single track coast, for multiple tracks you likely must crank, but not too hard. Quite important: Raise your butt off the seat and "suspend" your body on arms and legs. This isn't to save your butt (except maybe figuratively) but to assure that the bike doesn't bounce as it goes over the rails, and the wheels maintain firm contact. As you approach, always study the rails and whatever is placed beside and between the rails. Often there will be a gap between ends of wood pieces, eg, and you don't want to get your wheel too near that gap. Very occasionally there will be a splice in the rails themselves, and that likewise needs to be avoided. And, as one tour leader once told us, if the rails are wet, crawl across, dragging your bike behind you. 

Basically your variables (not independent) are cost, brightness, and battery life (if not using a generator). With regard to the battery you have rechargeable and disposable, which is perhaps another variable (definitely not independent of cost). You need to decide first what sort of use you will give the lighting system, both in terms of brightness needs (is it just to be seen, or do you need light to see?) and in terms of frequency/duration of use. If you only use a headlight occasionally then a simple clamp-on disposable battery unit is apt to be fine. If you will use the light to commute morning and evening in the dark, and your total commute time is 90 minutes, you need something entirely different (ie, a good rechargeable system or a hub generator). Unfortunately, I've not found a site that tests headlights for brightness and battery life, so you have to go by what the vendors say, which is often wishful thinking, or at least meaningless mumbo-jumbo. But, for the OP, living in the city, probably most important is a flashing taillight, the brighter the better. The headlight can be a simple clamp-on model. I once had a flashing xenon strobe (intended for use on life jackets) similar to this and it was the cat's pajamas.
