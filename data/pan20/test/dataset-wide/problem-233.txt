That's No Moon, That's a Space Station Ship! The first fundamental limitation to a space vessel's size is material strength. Beyond a certain point, whatever material your ship is made of will collapse under its own weight without exotic active materials. We can do some estimates using the Lane-Emden equation to predict the stresses the spacecraft will have to endure. I assume a spherical, incompressible ($n=0$) spacecraft in a vacuum. The math is a bit complex but the results are simple. Given a density $\rho$ and a maximum stress $\sigma$ the maximum size of the spacecraft is: $$ M=\sqrt{\frac{6\sigma^3}{\pi G^3\rho^4}} \\ R=\sqrt{\frac{3\sigma}{2\pi G\rho^2}} $$ Let's try three different materials: 

Even if you think this is achievable, you have to do it twice: India's Mars Orbiter Mission has a resolution high enough to see a the crater that would be left, and the instruments to verify Mars Express' "detection." MOM communicates via India's own IDSN network, which is physically located in India. Also: you wouldn't want to. 

Say you are going any speed, whatsoever. Any speed. To go faster, you simply attach a rocket at the back and light a match. Once again, no matter what speed you are going, to go faster you just fire a rocket. There is utterly no difference whatsoever, at all, in the fundamentals. Regarding travel at light speed, like a photon (or faster than light speed). This is simply utterly impossible, based on our current deepest understanding of mathematics. 

Note. OP's question was not clear if the travelers were "instantly" transported in an FTL sense. If the travelers are instantly transported, then as I explain it's trivial. If OP means moving billions of years in time, the question is meaningless. (There's no way whatsoever to predict where everything was/will be over huge time periods.) 

Detecting Galaxies Let's look at the example of UDF 423, one of the brightest galaxies in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field. It has an apparent magnitude of around 20, and an estimated distance of 7.7 billion light years (well outside of our supercluster). This gives it an absolute magnitude of somewhere around -21.8, making it only around three times brighter than the Milky Way (at magnitude -20.9). Since it's clearly resolved in the UDF, we can treat that as a good estimate for the level of detail we'd need to achieve in our observations to see the Milky Way directly. The instrument that Hubble used to capture the UDF is the ACS (Advanced Camera for Surveys), with a resolution of around 0.05 arcseconds. The main instrument on JWST is NIRCAM, with a similar resolution and sensitivity. The exposure for which the sensitivities are calculated is around 10,000 seconds, and the field of view is 4.4 arcseconds square. This means that a single JWST would take around 3000 years to scan the whole sky at that resolution. Speeding it Up Of course, we only need to find a couple galaxies that we recognize. Due to the huge number of them, the probability that we see a familiar one is actually pretty high. Once we are confidant of the location of one or more, we can start concentrating our search on a specific sector of sky, and the speed at which we start locating galaxies will be superexponential. Recognizing Galaxies As "BrettFromLA" says, we likely wouldn't recognize galaxies by visual comparison, especially since many would appear in different orientations (one which was once edge-on could now appear face-on). Galaxies would instead be matched by their brightness and spectra. This only gives us a fuzzy match, but Other Sources Although pulsars make good candidates for locating ourselves (since they are uniquely identifiable by their period) they are generally too dim to be visible billions of light years away. We can look at quasars, which do not have as clear identifying features, but are significantly brighter. The Sloan Digital Sky Survey identified most known quasars over around 35% of the sky, and took just ten years to complete. A network of telescopes could cover the whole sky in just a few years. Again, the quasars would be matched by their spectra. After our location is pinned down by the quasar survey, we can use spaceborne telescopes to locate the Milky Way. 

It's trivial: our observable universe, in fact contains only a few very large structures, which are easily identifiable. You'd just look for and identify the sloan great wall, the BootÃ«s void, and the 3 or 4 biggest superclusters. (Obviously, this would take incredible telescopes and a few years.) {Note that we already have "incredible telescopes". Read up on Europe's GAIA space scope, which is pure "sci-fi".} Vashu has already included in his answer and overall map of our observable universe, which shows how obvious it is. 

A plot point might be that the rebels use "rebel local time" just to make a point how ridiculous the Empire is. 

a handful of rebels would scoff at the idea as one of the ridiculous notions instituted by the Empire; most would just go along running the concentration camps. In any totalitarian society the majority just mindlessly go along and do what they're told. 

You are correct in assuming that "the primary obstacle is something something signal diffraction" The way to think about diffraction is something like this. Imagine a wave of light headed towards you. If the wave hits one side of your telescope before the other, then you know that it must have come slightly to the side of where you are pointing. However, if the angle is so small that the difference in between when the wave hits each side of the telescope is less than the wavelength, then you can't tell that one hit before the other. You can only get around this by making your telescope larger to exaggerate the difference. Although the precise number depends on the shape of the telescope, the minimum diameter required can be approximated by: $$ D = \frac{\lambda d}{b} $$ Where $d$ is the distance to the target, and $b$ is the desired resolution. We can plug in some estimates for the quantities, assuming that the distance is from Earth to the Alpha Centauri binary, the resolution is typical for Earth-observing satellites, and a wavelength in the middle of the visible spectrum: $$ \begin{align} D &= \frac{500~\text{nm}\times 4.3~\text{ly}}{15~\text{m}} \\ &= 1.4\cdot 10^6~\text{km} \\ &\approx 0.01~\text{AU} \end{align} $$ The required size scales inversely with the resolution. To get the same $0.5~\text{km}$ resolution as a next-generation geostationary imaging satellite the required size is only $42\,000~\text{km}$; but to acheive the $30~\text{cm}$ resolution of modern satellites the required size balloons up to $0.46~\text{AU}$. Atmospheric turbulence (seeing in astronomical parlance) is not an issue here. As usual, Randall does a good job of explaining this. So to detect human-size targets you would need a telescope the size of Venus's orbit constructed around one of the stars, and to detect an aircraft carrier you'd need a telescope just slightly larger than the Earth. 

Regarding point 1, of course - obviously - you might need staggeringly big rockets and other astounding engineering difficulties. (You may well need fusion! or anti-matter! engines to make huge amounts of electricity - whatever. You would surely need some sort of astounding laser technology to blast out of the way any micro-particles in front of you - etc etc.) Once again, thanks Einstein - any speed at all, whatsoever, is identical to no speed at all. There is absolutely no difference between speed and no speed. (Note that indeed our planet (indeed, our galactic group) is whipping along at an astounding speed; when we take off to the moon we just "add speed" - the "original" (staggering) speed of the planet means absolutely nothing.) Speed and no-speed are the same. In contrast - point 2 - traveling at light speed (or higher) is utterly and totally different, requiring utterly new base mathematical concepts, totally and completely unknown to us. 

The first thing we have to think about is atmospheric extinction: that is, how much the atmosphere absorbs and scatters light. Let's look at some cases on Earth to get an idea of how strong this effect is. 

Branching Timelines Model This is the model that I use internally (i.e. in my head) when I'm thinking about rewinding time-travel. Essentially, time flows horizontally from left-to-right. Whenever someone rewinds, the timeline ends, and a new timeline splits off from the point they rewound from. The new timeline is one layer down horizontally, so that overall progress is left-to-right, top-to-bottom like English text. Reversing Timeline View The person who suggested this view to me called it the "garden-path" model. The layout is the same as before (and the horizontal positions are the same), but the branch connections have been removed, and lines have been drawn from each rewind to the timeline that rewind starts. This forces you to follow the diagram in the same order as the text. There are a couple of additional annotations on this view:
