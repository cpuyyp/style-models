This clearly shows a saltwater ocean with a molten iron core. This means that life similar to our deep sea vent communities would be very capable of surviving on Ganymede and in fact is the most likely form any life would take there. Ganymede and Europa are the two prime candidates in our Solar System for life to be found. A follow on from this though is that while saltwater would probably be easier for life (it has more chemicals in it so is generally more useful) it probably doesn't make a big difference whether the water is salt or fresh. We know life can thrive in either. The main requirement is a source of energy, and a source of nutrients, and we know Ganymede almost certainly has both. 

Your contraption can actually be considerably simpler than this as you just need somewhere for everyone to stand/sit and a brake. To make deploying easier I'd actually have some guides built to pull the wheels into the right place as it drops onto the track. Tie the two guides to the back of the train, drop them down and slot them onto the rail, then run the cart down the guides onto the rails, again tying the cart to the back of the train. Once the cart is in place one conspirator stays with it while the rest do the robbery and then run back, jump on, and away you go. 

You have actually partially solved this yourself. The key to globalization is a network. A link between two points is not enough by itself, you need those points to connect on to other points. Towns where there are these paired portals would have commerce and trade between themselves and knowledge would travel faster but that would not be enough to globalize by itself. Particularly if the portals were too slow or too small to reasonably permit an army to pass through. They would be useful for messengers and you would end up with an interesting "distance map" when you look at travel from one point of the world to another but they would not be enough by themselves to reshape the world. One thing you might well find though is that a town that happened to have multiple endpoints for the pairs inside it would end up growing and becoming a central hub as a result. Many capital cities might well have that benefit and access to appropriate portals would be a major strategic advantage, as important as rivers and defensible positions are. 

Most of these are hard to explain though. Possibly the simplest two options would be to say either that the weapon that evaporated the oceans also threw most of the water into space or that oceans did reform afterwards but the continents had reformed with a different layout. A single large continent would have vast desert areas. 

It's not really feasible, and even if it was it's not what people would do. There are lots of good reasons not to place the generators on the moon (for example the obvious generation to do in space is solar, but the moon has nights and days). On the other hand though if we were running a Space Elevator out to just past geosynchronous orbit (so that centripetal force keeps it in place) then it would be quite easy to have massive solar panels on the station at the end of the space elevator and run the power from those back down the cable. That has most of the advantages of the moon and few of the disadvantages. 

I'm sorry to say that this shape seems very unrealistic to function as you describe. I can think of only one halfway plausible scenario. Think about this from an evolutionary perspective, what and how has this creature evolved? Where is it well adapted to? It's very wide, so it will be useless in trees or any other overgrown area. It's very slow which vastly restricts its hunting options. You've identified that and tried to solve it by saying that it's a ranged hunter, but how would that have come to be? What's the intermediate stage? The only way I can think of this working is if it was an amphibious ambush predator. Basically think of it as being like a crocodile but it lurks in the river until something gets close by sinking under the water with the legs coiled under it. It then surges out with one long leap and grabs the target. The wide stance and powerful body is used to launch out of the water and then drag the prey back in and drown it. An extension from this to then using ranged hunting tactics to surge out of the water and then throw a weapon becomes more plausible. In other words it's a cross between a frog and a crocodile :) 

Well, Luminescence really but I liked the alliteration. Would there be any reason or mechanic why plants may develop that glow in the dark? Ideally they would do so in response to stimulus such as touch, but continual or periodic glowing would also be acceptable. Is there a plausible mechanism through which they both could develop the ability and have an evolutionary reason to do so. Most of the reasons why animals do it (such as distracting predators, luring in food, or attracting a mate) do not apply to plants. I know we've genetically engineered plants to glow through bioluminescence, but I'm not aware of any cases where they have naturally developed the idea. Really I'm looking for a scenario where a "glowing forest" (or at least some glowing plants within a forest) could evolve naturally and be relatively widespread on a world. 

Ok, I really like the other answers, particularly the one by dsollen - but here is an alternative. A way is discovered to modify the rules of the universe, you actually have a generator of some sort that taps into your body and when activated starts altering fundamental constants. The effect goes through your body and then radiates out from it, with decreasing intensity. Some of the fields are able to extend out along other solid objects you touch. The fields themselves are generated by some unique breakthrough, you can insert any suitably intense energy force but fusion or matter-antimatter reactions should be sufficient. The key thing is though the bioelectrical field of a living being is needed to control and contain the force. The implants can be inserted into animals, and are used for electricity generation and suchlike in that way. Far more interesting though are the military, police, criminal and vigilantes who beg/borrow/steal/build/etc their own implants and fit them to themselves. These implants themselves are tied to the individual and so some are easier for some people to use than others. Additionally running multiple implants at once becomes exponentially more difficult, so while 1% of the population could theoretically use the implants 1 in 10 of them can use 2, 1 in 100 can use 3, 1 in 1000 can use 4, etc. But what about the super-powers? Here are some examples (some hand-waving will be needed to explain how the human body manages to keep working in some of these): Superfast is just that - you modify time around you. For your purposes you are moving and breathing at your usual rate. The field extends about an inch from your body with gradually decreasing effect and can be extended out to other objects with an effort. This allows you to catch bullets, wear clothing, etc. There are no problems with acceleration or similar from your perspective, although you will still exert large forces onto the ground below you. Supertough again is the same, a field that extends only to your skin. It allows you to massively increase the inertia of everything inside it without increasing gravity. As a result blows or even large vehicles will bounce off you. Going the other way you can jump and increase your inertia as you jump to allow massive leaps. Supertough part 2 - increase the molecular bonding force of you or an object you are toughing, strengthening it into it's current shape. Flying - modifying gravity. Again potentially able to extend to other objects to allow them to fly too. I'm sure you can come up with further effects along these lines but really just playing with material strength, inertia and gravity already lets you do most super-powers. 

So, this is actually fairly simple to answer. Limit the strength of engines and machinery but allow the development of electronics. This means they can use machines for doing detailed work (like creating computers) but not for anything that involves "heavy lifting". There are a number of ways that this could happen, just having them not invented seems very unlikely so I would suggest instead that materials are the problem. If there is no good materials available for making decent metals or seals (so poor quality rubber and steel or iron) then machines would not last very long if set to doing anything demanding. Cars might exist but they would shake themselves to pieces by the time they've done a thousand miles. Engines would be constantly springing leaks and spraying oil everywhere, etc. In order to do this I'd suggest having iron in very short supply in this world, you could also look at the other materials we use in a similar way and see which of those you need to restrict but iron would be a good start. No steel, no cast iron furnaces, limited blacksmithing. Basically everyone is stuck with bronze tools and they do not hold up so well. I'd also restrict access to high temperature fuels, have wood that burns at a lower temperature and either no coal deposits or also burning cooler. With limited access to high temperatures again it becomes hard to work with and develop advanced metallurgy. You would need to hand-wave a bit how they come up with the wires etc for the computer processing but you can do a lot with copper and glass. 

One thing to consider is that you are describing an arms race. In an environment where magic is this common you should expect counter-measures to be created as well. For example castle walls might have anti-magic enchantments upon them that protect both the wall and the men upon it from spells. You might have wizards in your army using countermagic or defensive spells to protect the soldiers. Equipment may well adapt as well, scatter a few shields along the shield wall that absorb fireballs and suddenly the threat is abated. 

Of course there is always The Avenger's flying carrier (which is ridiculously impractical but should be mentioned). 

Now, some things can be replaced by iterative trial and error. For example once you work out that gunpowder goes boom you can experiment with ratios to find the strongest mix. There would be no way to calculate the ratios of gears in an engine but again you could keep trying different combinations until you got what you needed. There would most likely be books published full of nothing but various tables, similar to the old logarithm tables. These tables would allow you to look up your designed inputs and outputs and it would then tell you the combination of gears to use. What I don't understand though is why the leap to abstraction would not be made. Once you've generated the table of gear ratios the patterns within them should be identifiable. Once you've identified the pattern you essentially have algebra, since all algebra is is a way to describe that pattern. 

The reason human giants have so many problems is because their systems are not designed to cope with that increased size. If they had actually been evolved to that size though then evolution would have provided solutions. After all look at the size of elephants, giants, even giraffes and horses. They all do fine being much bigger than us. You would expect proportionally thicker legs and arms, a larger chest and heart. An obvious improvement would be to increase the secondary pumping action of our leg muscles to help lift blood out of the legs, etc. Take a look at the adaptations in existing large mammals and it should be reasonably easy to transition the same over to humans. 

Santa is Satan, after all the clue is right there in the name. But why? What reason would the font of all evil and the generally unpleasant one have to pretend to be a jolly fat man and give away presents to make people happy for one day each year? Answers will be judged based on plausibility. Would a very powerful evil being of corruption and darkness actually think that's a good plan? 

The January 2003 issue of Astronomy had an article "Under Alien Skies" that investigated what the sky would look like from the surface of planets in multiple locations, including inside a nebular. There is a making-of article here: $URL$ It starts with the bad (boring) news: 

She ties loud bells to her hands, so that if she starts thrashing around in her sleep the sound will wake her up. When the wolf attacks her she grabs hold of it in her dreams, in the struggle she thrashes around and the bells awaken her. As she transitions from dream state to waking state while grasping the dream wolf, that pulls the dream through into the non-dream with her. Trapped in the real world the wolf is much weaker, so she can then grab it before it escapes and subject it to whatever process she likes to extract the information she needs. 

In theory I believe that if you moved far enough above the surface of the pole you should be able to reach an area where you have constant sunlight, even in the middle of winter. My question is - how far up would you need to go? Would it be possible to do this on earth and still be able to breathe? 

Essentially what we are describing here is a bright flash of light, not sufficient to injure the skin but enough to stop the eyes from functioning. According to wikipedia: 

So you want to expose a small area to significant levels of nuclear radiation over a period of time using natural means? My suggestion would be to use a mix of the following three things: 

The symbiotic arrangement above is the better way to do it - however staying within the constraints of the question there is only one real option: Convert and upgrade some Mongol hordes. Even if you don't have advanced technology you must remember something to give them some advantages somewhere, even if it's just hot air balloons for scouting. You just need to get a sufficiently warlike bunch on board and give them enough of an edge to be able to conquer anyone around them. Mandatory chastity belts for everyone (men and women). Train everyone as warriors. Demand a tax of children each year from all neighbours. Any that refuse kill all adults and take the children. Repeat until no-one refuses any more. Slap the chastity belts on the children and raise them as the next generation of warriors. 

The increased atmospheric pressure will make flight easier, but the higher gravity will make it harder. Reduced thrust will make things like propellers less effective, and jet engines would be right out. This leads us directly to a solution that is both pretty cool and viable - lighter than air transport. This could either be done using helium or a similar gas created magically or it could be done by heating air. The heating again could be done magically or just by lighting a fire on the platform under the balloon. The higher air pressure will make this more effective, as will the availability of silk for making the balloons. Low but constant thrust created by the muscles will allow the airships to move slowly across the sky. Combine that with selecting appropriate trade winds and you would not be as fast as modern air travel but it would still get you there and do so very peacefully. 

There is an example in Science Fiction where this is done - which is The Void from Peter F Hamilton's Commonwealth Saga. It's an artificially constructed portion of the universe where the rules have been re-written on a quantum level. One of the consequences of this is the ability to rewind time. The Void actually remembers all previous states and is able to rewind the universe internally to the remembered state while not rewinding the traveller(s). This seems to me like the only way in which something like that would be possible, you need something to remember the prior states and a way to reset everything back to that prior state. Of course if everything goes computerized and virtual then this becomes easier, we already know how to rewind computer time. Of course that doesn't work when you are talking to a real human being who would still remember no matter how often you pressed the undo button... unless real-time memory editing was a thing. 

There are two big reason energy weapons might get adopted assuming their performance can be brought reasonably close to guns, these are: 

The problem with your scenario is the time required to do the cooling, the presence of water vapor will make very little difference with that and may in fact slow the process as it works as a greenhouse gas. If you are prepared to wait for billions of years then the scenario may work, alternatively start with a cooler world and have multiple ice comets/asteroids hit it. Even a rogue planet coming in from interstellar space at an incredibly cold temperature will actually add more heat not cool things down just because of the incredible energy of the impact.
