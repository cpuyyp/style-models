You cannot do this cheaply. If you have a military force in a nation, it either needs lots of discipline and needs to be collectively loyal to the nation or be tiny, or it swallows the nation. You can see this happen throughout history. To sufficiently reward the mercs, you'd have to give them an independent income; land, serfs, etc. Then make their ownership of said land dependent on military service. Some mercs would get lots of land and have to supply lots of military service (more than they personally can do). We'll dub the mercs that get land "nobles". They have to provide fighting forces, let us call them "knights", at the request of the government. Part of the knight's service would be an errant phase, where they wander the land and solve village problems. They would have the right to commandeer food and shelter from local nobility (even petty nobility) for a short period, or longer if their service is required. A system whereby you earn some reward for solving the problems of villages during the errant phase of your knighthood could be developed. Having this different than "be paid money" is tricky, because avoiding fungibility is hard. But you could imagine having to build your own coat of arms or epic poem as part of this phase. The parts of the poem/coat of arms involved might require religious assent (and be tied to the village where you solved the supernatural problem). In short, remove said "mercs" from the economy; cover their needs independently, don't have them do it for money. Make them part of the "standing army" of the nation (or a phase of it). Now, we have knights, sworn to nobles. Before you can be a "landed knight", you must first be an "errant knight" and collect an epic of your heroism. Your food/shelter/armor is covered (from your sponsor/parent), so your need is for heroic deeds to do. Being a bandit doesn't get you heroic deeds, it just gets you cash. There is a risk that failed errant knights, who somehow are at risk of losing their knighthood status due to incompetence, injury or time, becoming bandits with weapons and at least some practice using them. In short, you cannot have a cheap powerful standing army; a cheap powerful standing army takes over its nation. Use the government structure of the nation to produce the standing army. You could split the knights into multiple orders. You could have the Knights of the Rose (landed noble), Knights of the Chalice (religious), Knights of the Coin (merchant), Knights of the Foam (naval), etc. To qualify as full member of whatever guild, you have to be sponsored for erranthood (involves equipping you and paying into some royal fund, which gives you the right to be fed/transported/sheltered). Then you have to complete your knight errant and earn an epic. Only when your epic is done can you become a full member of whatever guild (nobility, church, merchants, sailors). Such full members (and only such) would have the right to vote for their representatives in the House of Lords, which among other things determines taxation rates. 

You have FTL and gravity control. Between the two, physics is completely different. But I can try. First, energy. If we assume a 1% per year growth rate, 1000 years from now we have a 20000x higher energy budget (E4.5). We are currently a K-type 0.7 civilization; they would be a K-type 1.15 civilization. A K-type 1.15 civilization has no sigificant portion of its economy on planets unless it is a gas giant; their energy budget is 30x larger than what an Earth-sized planet can radiate without boiling its oceans. If we assume a 3% growth rate, they are a K-type 1.9 civilization (ie, within rounding error of 2). This has either swallowed an entire star in energy-consuming structures, or have lower density (say ringworld size) structures over a good chunk of the local galaxy. If we assume a 5% growth rate, they are a K-type 2.8 civilization (ie, within rounding error of 3). This civilization has swallowed every star in a galaxy in dyson-sphere like structures or found more efficient ways to use the energy of a star and are using it. 

Orbit isn't far away. Orbit is closer than a nearby city. Orbit is fast away. Things in orbit are going at a ridiculous speed so that they miss the Earth in the time it would take them to fall to the ground, and instead end up on the other side. The small amount of impulse a throwing arm could give would result in a slightly different orbit, missing the Earth differently, unless the orbit was already extremely low. If the orbit was extremely low, then an impulse could result in the stones being slowed down slightly more by the atmosphere. This would reduce its orbit even more, and eventually it would fall to the planet. Of course, the same was true of the original "orbit", it would just happen faster here. Accuracy would be next to impossible, as the tumble and air resistance properties of the stone would be difficult to predict, and the rentry point would be sensitive to relatively small changes in the speed and direction the rocks where thrown at. The stone could easily take more than one orbit to fall, with the shape of second (and later) orbits a function of how much speed it bled off in the earlier close approaches. It would definitely not involve throwing the stones "at" the location in question. 

This isn't always true. Star Wars and Star Trek are both extremely famous SF worlds where Humans often meet civilizations far behind them in technology (and sometimes ahead). There are many other examples. In fact, the idea that aliens marginally more advanced than us would show up in our civilization is exceedingly unlikely. Interstellar civilization is a relativistic phenomina. If you can colonize other stars, the amount of time it takes to colonize a galaxy a blink of cosmic eye, even with slower than light ships. Our primitive Voyager travels at 62000 km/h. At that rate it takes a mere 1.8 billion years to cross the Galaxy. If we had a civilization that sent "civilization seeds" (generation ships, star wisps, whatever) at Voyager speeds, and the new civilization took 100,000 years to mature to the point where they could send out a similar seed to two other stars within 10 light years, the net velocity of the probe would drop a mere 1/3. After even a handful of doublings, you'd run short of stars within 10 light years. If you can send the ships further, you do. There are 100 billion stars in the Milky Way. This is a mere 36 doublings. At 300,000 years per generation, that is 11 million years. The limit becomes the speed of the colony ships, not producing them, very quickly. It takes 10% of the lifetime of the galaxy to cross the galaxy at voyager speeds. Getting a star wisp up to faster speeds is not that hard with todays technology. The hard part becomes surviving the cold eons between stars, stopping at the other end, and sending enough resources to start a new civilization (even a machine one) at the other side. If the star wisps move 10x faster, at 0.0005c, they cross the galaxy in 200 million years. If we go science fantasy and go FTL, the effect is even larger. Now, why does this imply there aren't more advanced civilization? Because the speed at which they can travel means that the time between them reaching the stars, and them being here, is short compared to the history of life on Earth. Even a small difference in how they develop technologically would make a huge difference in the scale of their civilization. If they developed 1% earlier, they'd already be here. If they developed 1% later, we'd reach their planet in the equivalent of the dinosaur era. The ridiculous level of precision for them to be anywhere near us in civilization scale is not practical without some quite recent galaxy-wide synchornizing event. These don't make great stories. Now, if you want a story with humans that are "like us" and you still want interstellar civilization, the easy way is to give the aliens that civilization. This naturally places them far away from us. 

The maze isn't place to keep the Minotaur trapped. The maze is a Minotaur nest. The Minotaur is a mythical beast. It is an infovore: it eats information, and excretes mazes (information waste). It is attracted to civilization because civilization generates tasty highly abstract information: lists of goods, taxes, areas, names of citizens, salaries, calendars, etc. If not careful, the Minotaur gorges itself on the information content of a civilization, leading to the civilization collapsing in bureaucracy, corruption and disorganization. Minotaurs that adapt to their prey build a nest -- a maze of digested waste information (and emergency rations) and a distance buffer to keep their appetite in check -- and only eat enough to keep themselves healthy. Highly organized structures, like humans, provide a tasty dessert like snack on top of the ambient abstract information of the civilization itself. Humans who have complex plans have a better fragrance. The Minotaur isn't trapped in the maze: the civilization is a domesticated information factory owned by the Minotaur. 

Another insane design is a single long sausage that rotates to maintain gravity. You only get one dimension of long-distance, but you have an awesome radiating surface. The radius of the habitat can be as large as your non-unobtanium technology can pull off safely. Leakage remains a problem. Gravitational influcence falls off with the square of distance, so the integral of the pull from the ends towards the middle converges to a constant based off how big around the habitat is (and a small constant too: the near-infinite sausage has twice the "real" gravity as a a short one does at the end). 

1 Kt of TNT is 4.184e+12 J. 30 km/s is a Newtonian velocity, so 1/2 mv^2 is accurate. If we solve for 1/2 mv^2 = 1 Kt of TNT we get 10 tonnes of metal. At 150 km/s we get 25x that energy. A 4 m diameter 300 m long projectile of iron has a weight of about 30,000 tonnes. So it will deliver 3000 kT, or 3 MT, of energy. If left as a column much of this energy will "blast through" a relatively small object (like a space ship, or Ceres). We can use Newtonian projectile impact depth, which basically says we'd need at least 300 m of armor to significantly slow down this projectile (if it is made out of iron). Spalling in that case will be fatal to whatever is behind it. Generally, a projectile whose length times density is much larger than the depth times density of our target is going to blast through the target and waste kinetic energy. We can improve our ability to deposit energy on a "thin" target by shattering our projectile. You'd want to shatter the projectile at a distance measured by the rate of spread of the shattering and the density-depth ratio of your projectile to the target. This "spread" also enhances accuracy, as near misses become hits. A nuclear charge may be viable here to cause rapid spread, and also boost the velocity of some of the components. It would go off before you reach the target. 

In ancient times, while humans and dragons coexisted, killing a dragon would become a rite of passage. Doing it more than once would be considered taboo, and you'd be exiled. Human culture would select for opposing the effects of the first "dose" of dragon curse, as societies that did not would fall apart. As the dragons are pushed into their sanctuaries, only the warrior caste would continue with the dragon-cursing. Knights and other warrior caste members would have a ritual dragon-slaying, which makes them larger and stronger. They would be selected and indoctrinated before and after with ritualistic behavior and meditation. Religion would be built around this. If it can be managed, they would form the ruling caste, as it is hard to avoid your warrior caste from taking over. Possibly a matrilinial system would develop, where non-warrior women would manage society, while dragon-cursed warrior-monks would protect it. "Wild" dragon-cursed individuals would be a constant problem, as the system to control them wouldn't be perfect. Double-cursed would be hunted down and killed as too dangerous. Possibly dragon-cursed who could not manage their curse would be consigned to the gladiator pits, or maybe they would even generate multiple-cursed warriors especially for that purpose (and as shock troops in war). Another alternative is that the dragon-curse would be trained against, the individual would be cursed. Then tested to see if they are mitigating the problem well. These tests would be passed down in the order. If they are well mitigated, a second dragon-curse would be applied to make them even greater warriors. Such warriors would be tested, and if they fail would be culled. Various societies would develop around this process. The controlled harvesting and killing of dragons would be done; letting a dragon-warrior loose to hunt risks the dragon-warrior killing and then going rogue. So this is only feasible if the tests where really solid and predictable, at least one step out. 

There are a few forks. In the short term, some humans may adopt a sea-based hunter-gatherer survival strategy. Existing expertise with fishing is key here. The oceans have a lot of thermal mass, so they will take a longer time to freeze over. Another short term strategy involves greenhouses and copious use of energy. Geothermal power will function (until things break down), and nuclear power with its insane energy density could hold up pieces of civilization. The hard part is maintaining the supply chains to keep everything working under catastrophy and chaos. As time progresses, things get worse. A winter is different than an ice age. In a winter, the snow melts eventually. You can just push the snow aside, or gather it in an out of the way place, and wait. In an ice age, there isn't enough space to push the snow aside. It continues to build up. Glanciers form, and the ice becomes geological. The ground, which contains minerals and organics, becomes buried and out of reach to surface organisms. Deposited organics gets buried under yet another and another layer of snow and ice, and becomes lost to the surface biosphere until melting occurs. Even a sea-faring people need new materials, and even northern hunter-gatherers live on the land and get resources from it. So the sea-faring hunter-gatherers will be frozen out by the glaciers. The nuclear and geothermal bases can continue a war of melting. If a good chunk of a continent can be covered in such nuclear/geological powered colonies the glaciers could be held back. But as ice flows towards gaps, you basically need to melt an entire continents worth of precipitation. Total world rainfall is 5E14 tonnes. Melting water is about 300J/g. So to melt the world precipitation requires 5E15 watts of power. This is a K type 0.9 civilization, beyond our current budget. And way larger than what can be produced by geothermal (5E13) even theoretically. The thing that can save us is that precipitation has to come from somewhere, which requires sublimation or evaporation. As the world freezes over, less and less water vapor will escape into the air. Clouds will die out. Solar power will become more practical. The source of the ice age now matters. With clouds discounted, the sun's radiation will beam down on the Earth. The white earth will reflect more light, and together with if the sun's output is reduced it could explain a continued ice age. Use of solar power at this point could help with pushing back the glaciers. But turning solar power into electricity, then melting ice, is less efficient than just heating up the ice directly. Put coal dust on the glancier tops and let the sun heat them up. In the long term, things get worse. The oceans surface can freeze up, followed by deeper portions. Vents at the bottom of the sea remain melted, with liquid water volcanoes sometimes reaching the surface. All other life is gone (except possibly human nuclear/geothermal bases). Some think this may have happened in the past. The natural way to get out of it is to wait for vocanoes to emit large amounts of greenhouse gases, like CO2. With everything covered in snow and ice, weathering (which naturally removes CO2) and plants (rare, which consume it from the air) are missing. So the CO2 levels in the atmosphere build up to seriously large levels and the greenhouse effect kicks in. Things warm up, glaciers melt, albedo of of the Earth drops, things warm up more. If albedo drop outpaces weathering+live, the world continues to warm up. Eventually weathering+life+radiation start slowing greenhouse faster than albedo increases help it, and the world stabalizes with a melted ocean. So a long-term defence would consist of finding artificial greenhouse gasses and terraforming Earth. In the epoch term, whatever led to the cooling of the Earth may not be satisfied by simply painting it black. If the sun is dropping to 50% of its current brightness somehow, no amount of coal dust or greenhouse gases will prevent an iceball Earth. Humanity would have to climb up to a K1+ civlization and stop being planet bound to survive, all while trying to live through a catastrophe. Desperate measures and technological revolutions would be required. Human extinction is by far the most likely result.
