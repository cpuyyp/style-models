For $p=2$: up to multiplicative universal constants, the average $M$ of $\|\cdot\|_q$ over $S^{n-1}$ is equal to 

This can be checked most easily after switching to a Gaussian integral as Yemon mentions. For the lower bound in 1, it may be useful to consider using concentration of measure. If it is a matter of reference, it can probably be extracted from Chapter 5.4 in Milman-Schechtman, "Asymptotic theory of finite-dimensional normed spaces". Indeed, the value of this average is closely related to the dimension of almost Euclidean sections of the space $\ell_q^n$. Edit: let me add more detail. First, (this is true for any norm of $\mathbb{R}^n$, just by rotational invariance of the Gaussian measure $\gamma_n$), we have $$ M = \frac{1}{\alpha_n} \int_{\mathbb{R}^n} \|x\|_q \, \mathrm{d} \gamma_n(x), $$ where $$\alpha_n = \int_{\mathbb{R}^n} \|x\|_2 \, \mathrm{d} \gamma_n(x) $$ is a constant very close to $\sqrt{n}$. Now write $$ M \leq \frac{1}{\alpha_n} \left(\int_{\mathbb{R}^n} \|x\|^q_q \, \mathrm{d} \gamma_n(x) \right)^{1/q} \simeq \sqrt{q} \cdot n^{1/q-1/2} $$ (use the fact the $L^q$ norm of a standard Gaussian variable is or order $\sqrt{q}$). This upper bound is sharp when $q \leq \log n$, this follows from concentration of measure. Finally for $q \geq \log n$, the norms $\|\cdot\|_q$ and $\|\cdot\|_{\infty}$ are equivalent, and the question reduces to estimating the expected maximum of $n$ i.i.d. standard Gaussian variables. 

Take a noncommutative noetherian domain $R$ and a multiplicative subset $X$ (say just non zero elements of $R$). The standard construction gives a ring of quotients $RX{}^{-1}$, and I am looking at modules over $RX{}^{-1}$. From these module constructions we can define a certain subring $S$ with $R\subseteq S \subset RX{}^{-1}$. Now $S$ depends on the construction, and in particular it is not obvious whether $R=S$ in various cases, but I have questions about the subring in general: 1) Is there a classification of the subrings $S$? 2) Are there any standard methods to show when $S$ is itself a noetherian domain? 3) Is there any criterion which can be used to determine when $S=R$? One thing which can be assumed about the $S$ which I have is that they do not contain any $x{}^{-1}$ for which $x\in X$ was not already invertible in $R$. Basically I am asking if anyone has looked at the classification or properties of subrings $R\subseteq S \subset RX{}^{-1}$ in any detail. My guess is probably, and I apologies in advance for not being an expert in ring theory (the motivation comes from $C^*$ algebras). 

Note that any continuous surjection from a compact space to a Hausdorff space is automatically a quotient map. Also, there are 'space-filling curves', which are continuous surjections from $[0,1]$ to $[0,1]^2$. This means it is not very difficult for a space to be a quotient of $\mathbb{R}^n$ or even of $\mathbb{R}$. In particular, any connected Hausdorff second countable manifold will be such a quotient. 

This can be parametrised as $$ \gamma(t) = \frac{(a^2(c-s)^2-s^2c^2)p+2asc(c-s)(cq+sr)}{a^2(c-s)^2+s^2c^2}, $$ where $s=\sin(t/2)$ and $c=\cos(t/2)$. This passes through $p$ with derivative $q/a$ at $t=0$ and through $p$ again with derivative $r/a$ at $t=\pi$. It also passes through $-p$ with derivative $-2a(q+r)$ at $t=\pi/2$. Maple code is as follows: 

Let $A$ be the matrix with entries $m_i^*(m_j)$, and put $B(x)=xA+I-A$ and $f(x)=\det(B(x))$. We find that $A^2=A$, and $B(xy)=B(x)B(y)$, and $f(xy)=f(x)f(y)\in R[x,y]$. We also have $f(1)=1$. It follows that $f(x)=\sum_{i=0}^ne_ix^i$ for some elements $e_i\in R$ which are orthogonal idempotents, ie $e_ie_j=\delta_{ij}e_i$ and $\sum_ie_i=1$. If we put $R_i=R/(1-e_i)\simeq Re_i$ and $M=M/(1-e_i)M\simeq e_iM$ we see that $R=\prod_iR_i$ as rings and $M=\prod_iM_i$ as modules. Moreover, $M_i$ is locally free of rank $i$ over $R_i$. We also have $\text{tr}(1)=\text{tr}(A)=f'(1)=\sum_iie_i$, so $\text{tr}(1)$ maps to $i$ in $R_i$. It is cleaner to work with the elements $e_i$ because they distinguish the different $R_i$ even in a finite characteristic situation, which is not true for $\text{tr}(1)$. 

For a divisor in a complex manifold, what is known about a complementary bundle to the divisor in the manifold (either for the tangent or the cotangent bundle). Is there a description in terms of holomorphic line bundles? For a Kahler manifold it would be possible just to take the normal bundle, and split this into two line bundles over the divisor by taking the eigenspaces of the complex structure map $J$ (hope I got this right). But then what properties do these line bundles have, and how do they relate to the properties of the divisor? As a learner in algebraic geometry, is there somewhere to look to find out about this? Secondly an apology, I am definitely not an expert in algebraic geometry so I apologise if the answer is well known (it likely is) or if my question is confused (especially the latter)! I will have to explain where it is from: I would like to look at divisors on a noncommutative complex manifold. In noncommutative differential geometry ideas of rank or codimension are rather difficult, and in general require adding extra structure. (Understandably, textbooks on classical 'commutative' manifolds are happy simply saying complex codimension one, as there is not any problem in that case.) However the rank one case (line bundles) is known in noncommutative geometry - they have several definitions as invertible bimodules, self Morita equivalences and as integer graded Hopf Galois extensions. Even the idea of 'rank 2' is rather difficult to pin down, thus my wish to try to `define' codimension one by having a complementary bundle described in terms of line bundles of known properties. 

For the question with the absolute value, the expectation is maximal when the variables are independent (a special case of the Khatri-Sidak inequality). For the question witout absolute value, it is natural to conjecture that the maximum occurs when the variables form a regular simplex in $L^2$. I think I saw this conjecture formulated once in a paper about stochastic geometry. Edit: the question appears explicitly here (page 5). It can be reformulated as the question whether the regular simplex maximizes the mean width among simplices inscribed in a Euclidean ball in $\mathbf{R}^{n-1}$. 

Hidden in the comment by Victor Kleptsyn is a really nice argument. Since nobody upvoted that comment yet (I just did) it's probably worth expanding it. From a probabilistic approach it's more natural to show the equivalent statement that the expectation of $(\det A)^2$ equals $\frac{(n+1)!}{(n(n+1))^n}$. The trick is to realize the uniform measure on the simplex as the distribution of $$ (X_1,\dots,X_n) := \frac{(Y_1,\dots,Y_n)}{Y_1 + \cdots +Y_n} $$ where $(Y_i)$ are i.i.d. exponential random variables (say, of parameter 1). All you need to know is that $\mathbf{E} [Y_i] =1$ and $\mathbf{E} [Y_i^2] =2$. Moreover in this representation $(X_i)$ are independent from $S:=Y_1+\cdots+Y_n$. It follows that we have the following identity in distribution $$ B = D A $$ where $B$ is a matrix with i.i.d. exponential entries and $D$ a diagonal matrix whose entries are independent copies of $S$, with $A$ and $D$ moreover independent. Therefore $$ \mathbf{E} [\det B^2] = \mathbf{E} [\det D^2] \cdot \mathbf{E} [\det A^2] .$$ It is very easy to check that $\mathbf{E} [\det D^2] = (n(n+1))^n$, and $\mathbf{E} [\det B^2]$ can be expanded as $$ \sum_{\sigma,\tau \in \mathfrak{S}_n} \varepsilon(\sigma) \varepsilon(\tau) 2^{Fix(\sigma \tau^{-1})} = n! \sum_{\pi \in \mathfrak{S}_n} \varepsilon(\pi) 2^{Fix(\pi)} = n! \det \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 & \cdots & 1 \\ 1 & 2 & \ddots & \vdots \\ \vdots & \ddots & \ddots & \vdots \\ 1 & \cdots & \cdots & 2 \end{pmatrix} = (n+1)!$$ (Here $Fix$ denotes the number of fixed points.) 

NOTE - I have just read the comment on the existence of these approximate identities below - this certainly solves my immediate problem. I now have to find a reference. Many thanks to all involved! I am still curious about the two non-commuting operators though. 

This is embarrassing, I think it must work, but I can't see how to prove it works. If anyone knows enough functional calculus of operators on a Hilbert space to tell me how to do it, I would be very grateful. Of course, you might also tell me that it is wrong... Take positive bounded operators $x,y$, and increasing continuous functions $f,g:[0,\infty)\to [0,1]$ with the property that if $f(t)>0$ then $g(t)=1$. Then show that $$ f(x)\,g(x+y)= g(x+y)\,f(x)=f(x)\ . $$ Reason why I think it should work: If $f(t)>0$ then $g(t+\mathrm{positive})=1$, so it works... OK, this argument is not legal, but can the statement be proved in functional calculus? Purpose: This is to be used to show that for a separable C* algebra there is an approximate identity $u_n$ with the property that $u_n u_{n+1}=u_{n+1}\ u_n=u_n$. Maybe someone actually looked at special approximate identities with this sort of property? 

A self-dual norm on $\mathbf{C}^2$ need not be Hilbertian. Here is an example: $$ \|(z_1,z_2)\| = \begin{cases} |z_1|+|z_2| & if \ \ \ |z_1| \leq |z_2| \\ 2|z_1| & if \ \ \ |z_1| \geq |z_2|. \end{cases} $$ The dual norm $\|\cdot\|^*$ satisfies $\|(z_1,z_2)\|^*=\frac{1}{2}\|(z_2,z_1)\|$. Here a picture for $z_1$, $z_2$ real with $\|\cdot\|=1$ in blue and $\|\cdot\|^*=1$ in red. 

This is well-documented in the case where $C_1$, $C_2$ are unit balls for some norm, and in that case your $C_1 \otimes C_2$ is the unit ball for the so-called projective norm. The set you compare to in the last paragraph is the unit ball for the so-called injective norm, which indeed is a different norm. Googling these keywords should give many results. Also, you may look at Chapter 4.1.4 in the book "G. Aubrun & S. Szarek, Alice and Bob Meet Banach: The Interface of Asymptotic Geometric Analysis and Quantum Information Theory", where we consider such projective tensor products for general convex sets. 

No, as a counterexample take a closed "stadium" in $\mathbf{R}^2$ (the convex hull of two half-circles, I hope the word stadium makes it clear) and remove from it one of the endpoints of the half-circles. This is somehow related to the difference between extreme points and exposed points. 

This was a comment, but at the OP's suggestion I have promoted it to an answer. There is no Milnor exact sequence for homology groups of an inverse limit, only for the homotopy groups. If $I$ is the Brown-Comenetz dual of the sphere, then $H_∗(I)=0$ but $F(I,I)$ is the profinite completion of S and so $H_∗F(I,I)≠0$. Thus, you cannot hope for a method that works in complete generality. 

You should be aware of the book "A geometric approach to homology theory" by Buoncristiano, Rourke and Sanderson. However, I am not willing to claim that it is modern (1976) or easy to read. 

Here are some comments about the case where $X$ is not assumed to have finite type. Put $Y=\Sigma X$. For any field $K$, the groups $H_*(Y;K)$ form a Hopf algebra in which all elements of the augmentation ideal are primitive. If $u$ and $v$ lie in the augmentation ideal, then $u$, $v$ and $uv$ are all primitive, which gives $u\otimes v+(-1)^{|u||v|}v\otimes u=0$. If $u$ and $v$ are nonzero, it follows that $|u|=|v|$ and $Ku=Kv$, and $|u|$ is odd unless $K$ has characteristic $2$. Thus, $H_*(Y;K)$ is either $K$ or $K\oplus Ku$ for some element $u$, usually of odd degree. In particular, we see that $Y$ is rationally trivial or an odd-dimensional sphere. Now consider the groups \begin{align*} A(p)_k &= \widetilde{H}_k(Y;\mathbb{Z}_{(p)}) \\ B(p)_k &= A(p)_k/p \\ C(p)_k &= \widetilde{H}_k(Y;\mathbb{Z}/p) \\ D(p)_k &= \text{ann}(p,A(p)_{k-1}) \end{align*} so that 

Take a unital cp map $f:B\to A$ between unital $C^*$ algebras. Given a state $\psi:B\to \mathbb{C}$ what conditions are necessary for there to exist a state $\phi:A\to \mathbb{C}$ so that $\phi\circ f=\psi$? I am sure that the answer must be known, and apologise for my ignorance. In the case where $f$ is a unital $*$-algebra hom, and we consider the image of $f$ as a subalgebra, suitable conditions are given in -- Joel Anderson, Extensions, restrictions, and representations of states on $C^*$-algebras, Transactions of the American Mathematical Society 249(2):303-329, 1979. This comes from considering a possibility of defining the degree of a cp map at a pure state. The classical theory requires taking the inverse image of points, which translates to the current question. The states may be assumed pure if it helps (as in the paper above). As Nik points out below, the Hahn Banach theorem proves this if we have the inequality |ψ(b)|≤‖f(b)‖ for all b∈B. 

Under what conditions is the tensor product of two non-commutative Noetherian domains also a Noetherian domain? To be more precise about the problem, I am looking at rings of fractions on such tensor products, as a method of generalising the coaction of a Hopf algebra $H$ on an algebra $A$. Thus the coaction on an element of $A$ may lie in a ring of fractions on $A\otimes H$ rather than just $A\otimes H$. Any useful information on this would be gratefully appreciated!
