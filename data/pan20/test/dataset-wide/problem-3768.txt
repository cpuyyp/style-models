The other major class of cases where one can construct $E$ is when $R$ is a localised regular quotient of $L$, or in other words $R=L[S^{-1}]/I$, where the ideal $I$ can be generated by a regular sequence. There is a long history of general results of this type. I think that the sharpest versions are in my papers "Products on $MU$-modules" and "Realising formal groups" (although the methods used are not so different from earlier work). Note that the latter paper works with the periodic spectrum $MP=\bigvee_{n\in\mathbb{Z}}\Sigma^{2n}MU$ rather than $MU$ itself; this is more natural for many purposes. Note that in this context we focus on $\pi_0$ and note that $\pi_0(MP)=L$. There is one more useful construction which is less often discussed in the literature. Choose generators $a_1,a_2,\dotsc$ for $L=\pi_0(MP)$. Let $A$ be the monoid (under multiplication) generated by these elements, and put $T=\Sigma^\infty_+A$, or equivalently $T=\bigvee_{a\in A}S^0$. Now $\pi_*(T)=\pi_*(S)\otimes L$, and there is an evident map $f\colon T\to MP$ of naive ring spectra, which is an isomorphism on $\pi_0$. If we want to make an $MP$-algebra $E$, we could hope to start by making a $T$-algebra $E'$, and then put $E=E'\wedge_TMP$. In particular, suppose that $I$ is an ideal in $L$ that is generated by some subset of monomials in the generators $a_i$. Then it is easy to construct $T/I$ as $\bigvee_{b\in B}S^0$ for a suitable subset $B\subseteq A$, and we can hope to construct $MP/I$ as $T/I\wedge_TMP$. In particular, we can choose lifts in $\pi_0(MP)$ of the chromatic generators $v_k$, and use these as some of the integral generators $a_i$; then we can form $MP/(v_1^2,v_1v_2,v_2^2)$, which is similar but not identical to the thing that @LennartMeier mentioned in his comment. However, to make this work, we need more highly structured versions of $T$, $MP$ and $f$ (because there is no general construction of smash products of modules over unstructured ring spectra). We can construct strictly commutative versions of $T$ and $MP$, and also of $T/I$ when $I$ is generated by monomials, but unfortunately $f\colon T\to MP$ cannot be a map of strictly commutative rings, because $\pi_0(MP)$ has interesting power operations and $\pi_0(T)$ does not. There are some pitfalls with model category structures that can cause trouble here, and I have not checked all the details, but I think one can do the following, for example in the category of EKMM spectra. 

If I have a simplicially enriched model category, then I can take the coherent nerve of the full subcategory of bifibrant opjects to obtain a quasicategory. If I have a model category that is not simplicially enriched, then I could take the hammock localisation first and then take the coherent nerve. I have no technical objection to this, but I find it aesthetically displeasing. I would prefer to have a construction that accepts an arbitrary model category $\mathcal{C}$ and produces a quasicategory $N'(\mathcal{C})$ with the same homotopy theory in a single step. Ideally, all objects of $\mathcal{C}$ would appear as $0$-simplices in $N'(\mathcal{C})$, not just the bifibrant ones. Does such a thing exist in the literature? One idea (in the spirit of the thesis of James Cranch) is as follows. Given a left proper model category $\mathcal{C}$, an $n$-simplex of $N'(\mathcal{C})$ would be an $n$-fold cospan diagram consisting of objects $X_{ij}$ for $0\leq i\leq j\leq n$. There would be cofibrations $X_{ij}\to X_{i,j+1}$ and weak equivalences $X_{i+1,j}\to X_{ij}$ and the resulting squares would be cocartesian. I have not made any serious attempt to check whether this works. Alternatively, it may be that an answer is essentially contained in the paper of Barwick and Kan on Relative Categories, but I have not properly digested that. 

This is conformally isomorphic to the normalization of the hyperelliptic curve $$w^2=z^5-(a^2+a^{-2})z^3+z, $$ for a unique value of $a\in(0,1)$ which is approximately $0.0983562$. It is also conformally isomorphic to the quotient of the unit disc by a certain Fuchsian group which again depends on a single parameter $b\in(0,1)$ which is approximately $0.8005319$. There is a very long story behind all this, which is spelled out in my memoir "Uniformization of embedded surfaces" at $URL$ There is also a large body of associated Maple code and pictures which can be downloaded from the arxiv, or more conveniently from $URL$ 

Exact sequences occur in many parts of mathematics. The shorter ones can arise in many different ways. However, if you have an exact sequence of length six or more, it can usually be interpreted naturally using homological algebra, as the long exact sequence associated to a short exact sequence of chain complexes. There are some sequences that cannot be interpreted that way, but essentially all of those can be understood as the long exact sequence of homotopy groups associated to a suitable fibration. Typically, there is no other useful way to understand them. Moreover, the Dold-Kan theorem allows us to convert any short exact sequence of chain complexes to a fibration of spaces. Thus, the theory of fibrations and homotopy groups is essentially the simplest context in which we see all naturally occurring long exact sequences. 

Alternatively: if the order were $2$ then $M_n\wedge M_n$ would be $M_{2n}\vee M_{2n+1}$. The mod $2$ cohomology of $M_n$ has a generator $a$ in degree $n$ and a generator $b=Sq^1(a)$ in degree $n+1$ and nothing else. It follows that the cohomology of $M_n\wedge M_n$ has generators $a\otimes a$, $a\otimes b$, $b\otimes a$ and $b\otimes b$ and we find using the Cartan formula that $Sq^2(a\otimes a)=b\otimes b$. However, $Sq^2$ is zero on the cohomology of $M_{2n}\vee M_{2n+1}$. 

No. We can enumerate $\mathbb{Q}[i]$ as $\{a_0,a_1,a_2,\dotsc\}$ and then choose a holomorphic function $f\colon\mathbb{C}\to\mathbb{C}$ with $f(n)=a_n$ and $f'(n)=0$ for all $n$. This follows from a well-known interpolation theorem; some references are discussed at Which sequences can be extended to analytic functions? (e. g., Ackermann's function), for example. Now the set of critical values is dense, so you probably cannot do much better than Sard's conclusion that it has measure zero. 

Given rational numbers $a$ and $b$, what is the fastest way to determine whether there are any rational solutions to $a=x^2+by^2$? I am interested in the case where the numerator and denominator of $a$ have about $4$ digits, and those of $b$ have about $8$ digits. I am willing to restrict attention to solutions where $x$ and $y$ also have numerators and denominators that are not too large, if that will help. I would like to solve a large number of problems of this type, perhaps tens of millions, so efficiency is important. Both $a$ and $b$ will be different for each problem. I would also be interested in heuristics for roughly how often rational solutions exist. 

My attempt to do something like this for Agda is here: $URL$ I would also like to see a Coq equivalent (also Isabelle, Mizar etc) but I do not currently have the knowledge to write one myself. 

Experiment suggests that $$ d_k(k)= \prod_{i=1}^k \frac{2i-1}{3}$$ whereas $(4^k-1)d_k(1)$ gives the sequence A000182. 

Let $A$ be any discrete abelian group. The classifying space $BA$ is then a topological abelian group. If $A=\mathbb{Z}^n$ then $BA$ is an $n$-torus, as in the question. For any connected based space $X$, we have $[X,BA]=H^1(X;A)=\text{Hom}(\pi_1(X),A)$. Now suppose that $X$ is an $H$-space. For any based map $f:X\to BA$ we can define $g:X^2\to BA$ by $g(x,y)=f(xy)f(x)^{-1}f(y)^{-1}$. This corresponds to a class in $H^1(X^2;A)$ that vanishes on $X\times\{1\}$ and on $\{1\}\times X$, but any such class is zero by the Kunneth Theorem, so $g$ is nullhomotopic, so $f$ is a homomorphism up to homotopy. Thus, $BA$ is rigid. Conversely, suppose that $G$ is rigid and connected, and also that $G$ is associative up to coherent higher homotopies, so it has a classifying space $BG$ with $G\simeq \Omega BG$. Let $X$ be the topological group freely generated by $S^1$ modulo the relation that the basepoint is the identity. It is standard that this is weakly equivalent to the James construction, and thus that the suspension $\Sigma X$ is $\bigvee_{k=0}^\infty S^{k+1}$. We then have $$ [X,G] = [X,\Omega BG] = [\Sigma X,BG] = \prod_{k=0}^\infty \pi_{k+1}BG = \prod_{k=0}^\infty \pi_kG. $$ One can describe $[X^2,G]$ in similar terms and use it to understand which maps from $X$ to $G$ are homomorphisms up to homotopy. As $G$ is assumed to be rigid and connected, we can conclude that $\pi_kG=0$ for $k\neq 1$, so $G\simeq B(\pi_1(G))$. It is also standard that $\pi_1(G)$ is commutative for any $H$-space $G$, so we have a $BA$ as in the first paragraph. UPDATE: As Tom pointed out, the question that I answered was the opposite way around from the question that was originally asked. So suppose instead that every map from $G$ to an $H$-space $X$ is a homomorphism up to homotopy. By taking $X=\mathbb{Z}$ we see easily that $G$ must be connected. Taking $X$ to be an Eilenberg-MacLane space $K(A,m)$, we see that every class in $H^m(G;A)$ is primitive. Now take $A=\mathbb{Q}$. As $H^{\ast}(G;\mathbb{Q})$ is a Hopf algebra, it is a tensor product of polynomial algebras and exterior algebras, and it is easy to check that the product of any two primitive elements is not primitive. From this one can show that $H^{\ast}(G;\mathbb{Q})$ is either $\mathbb{Q}$ or an exterior algebra on a single generator. Similarly, $H^{\ast}(G;\mathbb{Z}/p)$ is a tensor product of polynomial algebras, exterior algebras, and algebras of the form $\mathbb{Z}/p[x]/x^{p^m}$. Again, the only way that everything can be primitive is if $H^*(G;\mathbb{Z}/p)$ is either $\mathbb{Z}/p$ or an exterior algebra on a single generator. We can now use the universal coefficient theorem to see that $\tilde{H}_{\ast}(G)$ is a single copy of $\mathbb{Z}$, in degree $d$ say. Also $\pi_1(G)$ is abelian (because $G$ is an $H$-space) and so is isomorphic to $H_1(G)$. We now see using the Hurewicz theorem that $\pi_d(G)=\mathbb{Z}$ and that any generator of $\pi_d(G)$ is a homotopy equivalence $S^d\to G$. The only spheres that admit an associative H-space structure are $S^1$ and $S^3$ (ignoring the nonassociative structure on $S^7$). I don't believe that $S^3$ is rigid but I don't immediately see a proof.
