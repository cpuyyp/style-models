bTwin is the bike brand from the big French multisports chain Decathlon. Their bicycle sales are quite big in France, Spain and Belgium. Rockrider is the name for the MTB line. Usually there are numbers attached to indicate its rank. From your picture it is probably their Rockrider 5.2. This is an entry level type. It dates from 2005-2010. 

I suggest to avoid Switserland, except for a small corner, because it is horribly expensive and boring. Stick as long as possible to Italy, my favorite biking country. I also suggest to do a couple of legendary passes that you could skip if you followed the line of least action, but that will give you lasting memories of the riding Italy's backcountry. Here is my recommended route, all done myself, but not in one season: Bormio - Grosio - Passo di Mortirolo - Edolo - Passo Aprica - Morbegno - Passo San Marco - Lenna - Passo San Pietro - Lecce - Como - Biella - Aosta - Col Grand Saint Bernard - Martigny - Col du Forclaz - Chamonix - Col des Aravis - Annecy. All in all 700 km and 14000 meter elevation gain. See $URL$ 

I have had a couple of times that an inner tube blew up while the bike was parked in bright sunlight. It seems that high temperatures are a contributing factor, but overpressure? I never pump my tires close to the maximum pressure, mostly the pressure is in the lower half of the min-max range. The pressure of compressed air increases proportionally to the absolute temperature, i.e. 273+T ; T in degrees centigrade. Hence an increase from 95F (35°C) to, say, 140F (60°C) will result in an increase by only 8%. I don't believe this itself is causing the blow outs. More likely the blow outs are due to an undersized inner tube in combination with a high temperature. Rubber is a material that behaves elastically in a limited range. Beyond a point it starts a plastic deformation. I guess that this point drops with higher temperatures. Most inner tubes are specified for a certain width range, e.g. 18<-->23C for road bike clinchers. The remedy is to buy an inner tube that matches closely with the tire width. 

As long as you keep within the elastic deformation range, there is no damage. The characteristic of the elastic range is that the wheel returns to its original shape if the force is removed. 

There is a book written by Frank Berto titled The Dancing Chain - History and Development of the Derailleur Bicycle. The fourth edition was updated in 2012. On page 368-369 he discusses chain design and chain types. Apparently, the 1981 Sedisport chain was the first bushingless chain. Its main feature was that it shifted better than bush-roller chains and also better than the Shimano Uniglide introduced in 1976. At the time, I guess 5 gear sprockets were the rule. With increasing number of gears over time, the bushingless chain took over from that point. 

So they are interpreting it in a careful way: You should not ride side by side (to switch to the back of the riding formation) if there is any (motorized) traffic overtaking you. Probably there is some other law somewhere defining what exactly is meant by hindering traffic, but I couldn't find it on the spot. Basically I think this boils down to: Only do it on official cycling roads (marked by brown/red signs, no or little motor traffic) and in large groups. That large group should have someone more experienced who can tell when it's okay and when not. 

I have an Alfine 11 (so very similar) and I had the hub replaced 2 times on warranty because of this skipping problem. The third one is fine so far (~15000km on it). So based on my experience: Have it replaced a second time. It also does skip when misaligned as mentioned in the other answer and yes it's tricky to get right and tends to misalign over time. Also it can freeze in the winter (still works, but need to change gears by hand on the lever on the hub) and this could also cause skipping because it would stick between gears. But your bike dealer should be able to fix/diagnose this within seconds. So my suggestion: 

Go to your dealer. Ask them to verify it's aligned properly and works in general. Test whether it still skips. If yes, demonstrate it in front of the dealer. Insist you need a replacement. 

This will always require some DIY, though. For example you could get a small cloth handlebar bag (worn+slightly dirty). Make two button holes (i.e. with the same technique, not for real buttons :) ) in the bag next to the handlebar and use a cable like this to tie it through the button holes to the handlebar with both loop ends hidden in the bag. Now you can lock something to the loop ends of the cable, for example a small lockable pouch made from strong tarpaulin (maybe reinforced by a layer of wire mesh on the outside). But from the outside it looks like any old cloth bag with at most something like a water stained map and a dented apple inside. :) Other idea: Mud stained non-translucent drinking bottle. Just leave it in the bottle-holder with your stuff inside. 

Your braking technique is probably bad with respect to overheating. Continuing to ride could help, but only if you do periodic breaking, i.e. you don't break at all until you reach max safe speed, then you brake hard to slow maybe by 10km/h, repeat. How much speed to lose depends on slope (how fast you gain speed again) and load (how much energy is dumped into your brakes to slow the same amount). If you brake more in one go, then your brakes have more time to cool in between but your average speed is also slower. In the absolute worst case (heavily overloaded/bad brakes/too steep) you stop almost all the way and your max safe speed is also pretty low. Make sure the periods of braking are much shorter than the periods of free-rolling. If your rim brakes become too hot you risk melting the tube (or otherwise damaging the rim, but I suspect first to go would be the tube) and at least disc brakes also just stop braking at all once they are properly overheated (I can tell you from experience, this is no fun). If the above technique doesn't suffice, then it's too steep and/or there is too much load on your bike for this gradient and you must periodically stop and let the brakes cool or just walk your bike down the hill. 

Although it is difficult to read the type on your slightly fuzzy picture, several details suggest that it's an enduro or downhill type Specialized: massive frame, fairly long front travel, big brake discs, rear triangle that allows big swings. Searching for Specialized and enduro produced a nice survey suggesting that it dates from 2005-2006. $URL$ 

Schwalbe's Q&A Which rim tape should I use? advises a tape that covers the rim bed over the full width. According to the pictures, only the floor of the bead area should be covered. I guess this is in agreement with the ETRTO standards. 

Even with a finite-element tool kit you would need a lot of physical data in order to be able to calculate the RR. In addition to data for the tyre casing and rubber you would need the visco-elastic properties of the foam. Deformation of a foam will certainly absorb more energy than deformation of an air chamber, hence result in higher RR. There is a kind of foam tyre made of closed-cell polyurethane foam sold under the trademark name Amerityre Flatfree. You can find on the internet an investigation of this tyre by Thierry Larose Chevalier et al from the University of Ottawa. $URL$ The results of this study are a bit ambiguous. Based on in-shoe force measurements from cycling on training rollers the authors state that there is no significant difference in RR with a traditional clincher road tyre. However, the participant cyclists subjectively commented that they felt more resistance. 

My experience, although not with a 1x11 drivetrain, is that the chain very rapidly adapts and stops skipping. Recently I replaced the chain of my 10-sp Campagnolo Chorus drive train. Initially it skipped frequently, say >10 times per km, on the 17-18-19t cogs, which is my usual comfort zone. After riding in a strong headwind on 21t for about 30 km and return with a tailwind on 15-16t, surprisingly the skipping on 17-18-19 had almost disappeared. After another two 60 km rides the skipping has stopped completely. I expect that probably next time the chain is worn, say after 5000 km (road bike), the trick doesn't work and I have to replace the cassette. So my advice is to go out for a ride in which you don't use the cogs that cause skipping. See what happens after that. Perhaps make some intermediate statistics in which you do use the bad cogs and count the number of skips. Might be interesting feedback. I don't think your chainring will be harmed from this. It will wear according to the actual chain elongation, independent on whether you renew or not renew the cassette. 

I understand this to mean that any condition a-d is sufficient to allow exactly two (motorized) bicycles side by side, with the caveat that you aren't ever allowed to hinder the rest of the traffic. ASVZ Rennvelo (cycling club of large Swiss university) has the following in their introduction document for people interested in joining one of their riding groups: 

I was wondering whether 20" wheels can get away with smaller rotors than 28" wheels, and if there is a correlation, if it is linear. If it was linear, then 140mm discs on a 20" wheel would be equivalent to 200mm discs on a 28" wheel (and it would be unnecessary to mount anything bigger for pretty much any application). At a given forward speed, the circular speed of the rotor scales up linearly with decreasing wheel size, which on smaller wheels should help with the cooling and should provide higher friction power and thus higher braking power. But I can't find any source confirming this, so I'm asking here. 

The relevant law text in Switzerland is on admin.ch (quoting German version, the French an Italian versions are also available at that link and just as legally binding. I'm not translating it, but very roughly summing it up below): 

(in short: best solution is in the first bullet point) There are quite a lot of possibilities, as reflected by the myriad of different answers. Here is an attempt at summing them up together with my experiences with them (where available). The problem appears when there is cold wind blowing on the scrotum+perineum and when they are wet and cooled by evaporation. If you are a women who wants to warm your corresponding area: I don't think this answer is actually too gender-specific if you mentally replace any references to male body parts. Should probably work for you too. Just dressing other parts of the body warmer doesn't help. I tested this a couple of times and it really seems to be true. And it makes sense: heating the testicles (and torso in general) is a priority for the body, if that stops working then you have much bigger problems because you definitely have hypothermia. So the solutions need to be about keeping the wind away from this specific area and keeping it dry. The obvious luxury solution is the answer by Criggie: Get a fairing. This keeps the wind away and if it's good the rain too (also: speeeeeeed :). Other solutions work like an additional layer of clothing: Inner layers: 

Switzerland: Cycling on pedestrian facilities is forbidden unless there is a sign allowing it. There are lots of people who ignore this (both people who are uncomfortable in traffic, and people who are optimizing time at all costs, like couriers). In general this seems to be tolerated by the police, although they can make an example of anyone if they want to.
