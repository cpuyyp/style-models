Answer: No you don't need a new hub. However, you will probably need to put a small (~1mm) spacer at the back of the cassette, otherwise you won't be able to tighten the whole cassette down. Also be aware that prolonged use of a 10-speed cassette on an 8/9-speed freehub body will cause dents to form in the freehub body (because the 10-speed cogs are so narrow). The 10-speed freehub bodies have taller splines, so they avoid this problem (but don't work with 8- or 9-speed cassettes). 

The best thing to do is make your own studded tires from the old tires you have. You can buy roofing nails for very cheap, and put lots of studs on the tire (most commercially available studded tires don't have that many studs). Push the nails through from the inside of the tire, wherever you want them. It's a good idea to put some on the rolling surface, and some on the sides for cornering. Once you have placed all your nails, put a layer (or two) of duct tape over the heads of the nails to protect the tube. You'll probably need to trim the nails down to the desired length with metal clippers. That's all there is to it! EDIT: I have had luck with nails in the past, but on looking around at studded tire designs online, I realize that screws may in fact be a better option, as they will better resist backing out, and would be easier to replace. Scroll down on this page for DIY instructions. 

In the city, it's best to "take the lane" and behave like traffic. However, on country roads, I prefer to do the following. When you hear/notice a car approaching, weave out about a meter into the road, then weave back. Repeat this a couple times, until the car is very close, then just hold your line on the edge of the road. The car will worry that you might weave again, and give you ample room. 

It's different insofar as walking on ice is different from walking on concrete. Traction is reduced anywhere from somewhat to greatly. It takes a much smaller change in direction, much smaller amount of braking, and much shallower lean angle in a turn to cause you to break traction. In terms of the physics and techniques involved, they're the same, though mountain bike techniques come in handy as you are likely to spend much more of your time without traction compared to typical riding on paved surfaces. 

Although wear and tear does not affect a single speed drivetrain perfomance to the extent it does a geared drivetrain, a little maintenance will provide your single speed with an even longer lifespan. Lubricating the chain helps ease the movement of the pins, rollers, and plates of the chain, and will therefore increase the life of your chain. Although this link is for a clock website, the images do a pretty good job of illustrating why lubricants are necessary in general. With no exceptions that immediately come to mind on a bicycle, anytime you have moving parts you are going to need some sort of lubrication. Gears or not, your chain should remain lubed. As was pointed out by another answer, anytime you start to hear squeaks coming from your chain it's time to re-apply lube. 

Try engaging the chain whip on different cogs of the cassette. Overlap the chain on the chain whip so that it binds itself in place if necessary. 

No. Single speed freehubs have totally different spacing so you have a less dished wheel. You'll have to use spacers. 

You can't make your front wheel sit lower without replacing the fork, and even if you switch to longer-drop brakes (I assume they're dual-pivot calipers if it's a racing-style bike), you can't easily move the mounting bolt. The only options I can think of are: 

If the back wheel is locked, skidding it should still have some braking effect, so I'm inclined to view this as evidence for poor traction. 

Firstly, I do agree with some of the other answers that riding better can help - my main hazard is glass, and I simply got fewer punctures as I got better at spotting and avoiding it. Knowing how to avoid or handle bumps and potholes is similarly useful. 

if moving the rear wheel in the drops works, keep both tyres for the rear wheel and buy a single smaller tyre for the front (cost: 1 extra tyre) get wider rims, to flatten the tyre's cross-sectional profile (this is a lot more expensive than just buying new tyres though, and I'd hate to speculate on what width you need to save your 2mm+) (cost: 1 or 2 wheels, depending on 1) get a new front fork, only if 1 works (cost: 1 fork + maybe paying your local shop to cut the steerer tube) just get new tyres and sell the old ones - say they're unused and didn't work for your bike (cost: depends on what you can sell the tyres for) 

If you want foot retention without switching to clipless shoes, you could use pedal straps (like these, or these, or just search for "pedal straps"). They're fabric rather than metal or resin, so should do less damage to your work shoes. 

Get an adjustable wrench and a small piece of cardboard. Smash the cardboard as flat as you can and fold it over the bead of the rim- this keeps the wrench from gouging the aluminum rim. Adjust the adjustable wrench down as far as you can while still able to slide it over the cardboard that's protecting the rim. Now, very gently torque the dent back straight with the wrench- it won't take much effort. This will work for small deformations only. If you see any further indication of damage after doing this, such as a crack in the rim, don't ride it. 

Place a single leading spoke and a single trailing spoke- both on the same side of the hub- to get your placement correct. That way you only have to unthread two spokes if you're off. Once you've got it right, unthread the leading spoke if you're planning on lacing trailing first or vice versa and proceed as normal with lacing. 

To add to Daniel's comment, there is no real benefit/detriment to one vs the other, but you are going to find that rear shocks are typically higher pressure for a few reasons: 

My tip would be don't disassemble the lever! Shimano unfortunately did not design their shifters to be serviceable. Shimano STI levers had a terrible habit of fraying the cable at the cable head until it eventually broke off. This was supposed to be remedied in the new generation of shifters but they still do it to a lesser degree. In other words, you're not alone in this problem. Unless you broke something while fishing the cable head out I'd say there's good chance that there's still a piece of cable floating around inside the shifter somewhere. My suggestion would be to undo the brake cable so you can pull the lever further back and get a powerful flashlight to look around inside the shifter with. Actuate the shifter and see if you see anything amiss. The whole thing would be easier if you take the shifter completely off the bike. 

I have heard rumors that (excessive) stretching can hurt cycling performance. Specifically, stretching one's hamstrings and/or quadriceps supposedly reduces sprinting power. Is there any factual basis for the claim that increased flexibility leads to less power? I would also be interested in evidence for the opposite: that loosening one's muscles leads to an increase in cycling performance. Note, I am not referring to over-stretching related injuries (like a strain), but rather to the results of long-term, correctly-practiced stretching that leads to increased flexibility. 

There also a book called The Art of Urban Cycling, in which the author focusses on bicycling safety amidst traffic in many different situations. I have not read it, so I'm not sure if it's any good, but it could be worth checking out. 

The main idea is to keep scabs from forming. Scabbing retards the healing process greatly, and will increase scarring. The Neosporin that was suggested above and other generic antibiotic ointments help with this; this is an economical solution. You can get gauze that is already impregnated with Neosporin-like things, or you can apply the ointment to the wound and then put regular gauze on top. For large areas, it can be hard to keep the bandage on the wound which is why I recommend other products like Tegaderm. Tegaderm and similar products that are designed for burn victims work great. The nice thing about tegaderm is that you can stick it on the rash (once it's clean) and then leave it on there. It stays on the wound without needing tape or other adhesives, but it doesn't pull or damage the healing skin when/if you pull it off. It forms a protective "skin-like" layer while the skin underneath grows back. You can leave it on for a long time without changing, and it speeds the healing immensely. 

The red circles are where the bearings brace against the axle. The drive side of a freewheel hub has a lot more axle acting as a lever than does a cassette hub, and this is the primary reason they break. Is an 8spd spaced freewheel hub more likely to break than a 6spd spaced freewheel hub? Yes it is, but marginally. Even working in a shop for years, I cant say that I saw a statistically significant sample of broken axles come through to say that 8 speeds broke more often than 6 speeds- probably the opposite as the 6 speed hubs were older and had seen more use. The bigger comparison here is freewheel vs cassette wheels, and I can tell you without a shadow of a doubt that cassette hubs hold up better. Since a cassette hub isn't what you're looking to use though, I would say don't concern yourself with the increased likelihood of axle breakage when going from 6spd to 8spd. You're probably going to be less likely to break the axle, assuming you buy a new axle for the conversion as you'll be starting over again on the fatigue life for the axle. 

Get the shifters changed out first. You're unlikely to notice any difference with an XT rd if you've got budget shifters. On the flipside if you've got the part sitting around already, there's no harm in changing it out - it's just not worth your time. 

There are several that you can try, many of which are listed here. Should that link go down, here's the apps listed at that page: 

When I press my pump head onto the (presta) valve, I can feel & hear air escaping until I twist the hose/head junction to lock it on. When I unlock and remove the head, some more air escapes until it is fully clear. To me, this indicates that the pump head holds the presta valve open, and the pump head must have its own return valve. This pump head is double-sided though (one side presta, one schrader), so it's possible that a dedicated presta head would be able to rely on the tube's own valve. 

Does that mean it has knobbly tyres? More contact area is generally better on asphalt, so slick or textured tyres will have better traction (and, as a bonus, generally lower rolling resistance). 

If it's a folding tyre (rather than a wire bead), you can just turn it inside out and inspect the puncture site. If something's still lodged in there, you'll be able to see it (or feel it - carefully, since it's sharp). Then, push it out from the inside. It's worth brushing down the inside of the tyre while you have it off, in case the tip of the sharp snapped off and is still rattling around in there. Finally, you can get a toughened variant of superglue which is ideal for glueing up cuts - search for flexy cyano glue. It doesn't repair the breaker strip to original strength, but closes the surface cut which will otherwise accumulate grit and wear more quickly. 

Seems that is the Look Memory Eyelet, where you can attach some kind of tab to help get replacement cleats in the same position. This Keo page seems to have a video on the subject, but I can't view it immediately ... 

Two possibilities as I see it. 1) the pads haven't bedded in yet. It takes a good handful of hard stops before a new set of pads start stopping you well. Go out on the street in front of your house and speed up and pull the levers hard a few dozen times. 2)the brakes arent actually properly adjusted and the actuator arm is bottoming out. Mechanical disc brake calipers basically act like a screw to press the brake pad against the rotor. This is done by the cable being attached to an arm on the caliper that turns the "screw". It is important that the cable is properly adjusted for this to work. One one side of the caliper (or both, depending on your model of brakes) there will be a knob that you can turn that will move the pad in toward the rotor independently of cable tension. Some folks adjust the cable in too far instead of using these knobs to adjust the pads. You can test this by taking your wheel out and pulling the appropriate brake lever. If the lever still stops at nearly the same point that it did when the wheel ws in, then you've found your problem and you need to take the bike back to the shop to have the brakes adjusted properly. 

This is for practicality. The cable across the top of the top tube is for the rear brake and puts less of a bend in the housing that leads to the brake caliper- you reap the most benefit from this cable routing scheme with rim brakes.
