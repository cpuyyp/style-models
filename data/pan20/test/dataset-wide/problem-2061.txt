Unless your girlfriend is the only employee having her hours reduced, the reason is indeed known - not enough demand. Most potential employers would understand that. It happens all the time. As she seeks her next job, your girlfriend should try harder to see if her desired number of hours will be available on a regular basis before she accepts an offer. 

If your situation is unique, you will by definition have a hard time getting an offer for the same situation elsewhere. 

If I understand correctly, you ratted out members of your own team to your managing director, including one that is "close to you". Big mistake. Yikes. No wonder development doesn't trust management. One of their team leaders cannot be trusted. And the managing director stupidly called them out on the information he got. It's one thing to conclude that you believe some team members are leaving, and you don't want to invest more in them. It's another to run to the managing director with this information. Now all of your team has learned what you did - word spreads quickly. You have demonstrated that you cannot be trusted. I'm not sure how you can expect anyone to be honest with you any longer. Unless you were given explicit permission to tell the managing director, you have betrayed their trust. Going forward will be difficult, but you'll need to somehow show them that you can be trusted. Look for opportunities to do this. You might consider apologizing to your team, indicate that you messed up, and tell them that you certainly won't do it again. Don't say this unless you mean it. 

"Should" is something only you can decide. In general, a company (even a non-profit) should fund their own business needs. But this may be such small potatoes, that it does't matter much. How much are the adaptors? If they are a few bucks that you can easily afford, there's little harm in buying them. If they are more than a few bucks, then do the work of convincing your boss that they are needed. 

It's always okay to ask for something you want. Be aware however that they are unlikely to share the results with applicants. While you may just be curious, others sometimes ask about test results with the thought to check for correctness, fairness, etc. or as prelude to argue about the results. No employer wants to get into an argument about such a test. Since (at least in the US) employers aren't required to share the results of pre-employment tests, and since there is absolutely nothing for the employer to gain by doing so, most likely they won't share them with you. I've only worked at a few companies that required such tests, but none of them would ever share the results. 

If you are determined to mention your illness, the proper place is within your cover letter. There's no logical spot for this on your resume, and you should never embellish your official transcript. You might wish to be careful here in mentioning your illness at all. If this is a lingering or recurring illness, you might be raising a red flag with potential employers that you might not be able to meet the needs of a new job due to your illness. Even if that's not the case, you might come across as someone who is simply making excuses for poor performance. That's not something you want a potential employer to suspect. If your academic performance was otherwise stellar, and one bad illness triggered these transcript problems, it may be best to leave a deeper discussion about that fact to the interview process itself. Additionally, you have not yet been granted a concession by your school. You should check in with your school's co-op office to make sure you are actually still eligible for co-op jobs under their rules, before you apply. 

You could say something like "You know, the one thing I'm looking to avoid this time around is a micro-manager!" That might work, although many folks don't recognize that trait in themselves. Better would be to get to chat with some of your potential peers (other folks who work for this manager). Ask "What's it like to work for X? What do you like? What do you not like?" Before this, be very clear in your own mind what constitutes "micro-managing" and what does not. Different shops have different views on this. 

If you went to college - start there. Many schools can connect you with graduates who can help out. Meetups could be helpful. Conferences are great networking places too - and folks in your network might become a mentor over time. 

It's unlikely your decision not to follow instructions would be seen as "disrespectful". On the other hand, you were specifically told what level of formality was expected. There's no advantage to dressing more formally. And it's possible (although probably unlikely) that someone would wonder why you can't follow instructions. When I interviewed candidates, I always made sure to let them know (either directly or through a recruiter) that we were business casual. If the candidate showed up in a suit, or otherwise overdressed, it didn't improve their first impression at all. It made me wonder if I forgot to tell them the "dress code". As long as you don't overdo the formality, you'll likely be okay. But since you were given specific clues as to what was expected, I would follow the instructions and dress in business casual. 

What you "should do" isn't really something this forum can answer. That will depend on your tolerance, patience, the importance of this particular job to you financially, local laws, and the willingness of folks at your company to do something about your issue. Based on how your describe your aversion to cats, and the seeming cat-friendly environment, I'd just find another job, then quit. But your mileage may vary. 

For me, it would look odd and raise some suspicions. I think the company name should be stated. Since it's only a summer job, unless you really need this job to show particular experience, you could choose to see how your resume looks if you just omit the position entirely. I suspect it would look better than a job title without a company name. 

If you conveyed your concern for her personal emergencies, thanked her for caring about work enough to offer to work over the weekend, and asked if there was anything you could do to help, then it sounds like you did exactly the right thing. Make sure you follow up and ask next week how things went. And if you convey to your team your understanding for their home life needs as you have here, I'm sure they'll understand and appreciate it. (You probably want to skip the "important that we all give more than 100% to work" phrase, or risk being laughed at. Nobody really believes that anyone can ever give more than 100%.) 

You probably should have talked face-to-face about this task with your coworker rather than sending emails. That way, you could have empathized a bit about your coworker's feelings but gotten back on track quicker, rather than just seeing a long rant unfold. But if you aren't successful trying to redirect the conversation to the mutual task at hand, you must bump the problem to your manager. It's not your job to fix your coworker's attitude. I have no idea what a "lateral leader without authority" can be expected to accomplish without cooperation in your company, but that's for your boss (and perhaps his boss) to decide. 

Tiny startups can go through rapid ups and downs. Many terrific companies went through extremely tough times in the early years of their existence. Some went through many ups and downs before they settle into a stable life. I worked for a slightly larger startup that "reinvented" itself several times before finally becoming stable. They eventually got purchased by a much, much lager company. Those of us who stuck around through the tough times were rewarded with a very nice acquisition bonus. There's no way for anyone outside the company to know if this is a death-knell, or a momentary blip, or a chance for reinvention. It's likely that even the 5 of you in the company can't know that for sure, either. You need to decide what kinds of risks you are willing to take, how much you trust the judgement of those in charge, and how you want your professional life to progress the next few years. You need to decide how much advance notice you would need in order to find your next job, and if you were averse to accepting that you might not know until it happens. You should consider your overall marketability, as well as your professional network. Startups can be a ton of fun, and a great experience. But they can be quite a "thrill ride", too. 

Yes. You are in a typical large-company situation. I happen to work for a company almost exactly the same size, with what sounds exactly like the same pay structures. Arguing "why doesn't the company do things differently" isn't likely to be fruitful. So asking "why the department couldn't get additional funds if they have high-performing employees being paid below the industry average" probably won't help. Nor will pointing out the company's stated goal of paying 105% of the industry average. Big companies are slow to move. And when the standard practice is to give your manager a fixed percent of salary to disburse to the team, it's quite hard to get exceptions. (I've tried for years). That said, the squeaky wheel gets the grease. You should continue to remind your boss of the great work you are doing, particularly at the end of a successful project, and ask when you can expect to get those out-of-cycle raises. It may not be the immediate jump you are looking for, but over time could get you to a better position. Make sure you continue working hard, and with a positive attitude. Managers like to do things for great performers, particularly those who are upbeat and positive. 

Perhaps there's a hint in here. Perhaps you need to perform your "analysis" up front - before you are hired. Perhaps you need to offer your services of analysis as a separate contract offering with the potential to turn into a longer-term gig if the need arises. If you are an expert in the field, and have convinced three companies to hire you with the possibility of "innovation" maybe you could come up with a compelling pitch offering a short duration gig just to perform the analysis. Then if it turns out to be helpful to both sides, move on from there. 

You talk with your supervisor again. This time, instead of asking for a task to work on, say "What would you like me to do in the future when I find myself with no tasks to work on?" That way, you'll learn how to handle the situation on your own, instead of interrupting him each time. 

If you want to work remotely, ask your boss if you can work remotely. Provide reasons why it will benefit the company as well as you. But try to talk about it separately, not as compensation for feeling betrayed. You'll just weaken your argument and be less likely to get what you want. 

Yes, in contemporary western culture, an email is acceptable. The majority of people who even bother to send thanks at all use email. But, do you really want to settle for acceptable, when you could do better? I've interviewed a lot of candidates over the years, and I've received a lot of thank you notes. The ones that really stand out were hand-written on note paper, and it was clear that the writer had put some real thought into them. Often they thanked me, but they also emphasized details that had come up during the interview which they wanted to expand on. The best candidates sent an email immediately with quick thanks, then also followed up with a longer, paper thank you note. Send emails if you want to meet minimum acceptability standards. Do better if you want to stand out from the crowd. 

I don't think there's anything constructive you can do in this case, unless you happen to know that everyone other than the first choice was informed that they were not chosen. If that were the case, and you suspect that you were a "finalist" you could consider talking with HR and indicating that you are still available. You could also ask your contact if she/he would put in a good word for you. It couldn't hurt.
