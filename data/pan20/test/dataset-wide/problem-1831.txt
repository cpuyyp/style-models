Using the new portal, you can move a resources in a resource group to another resource group. The capability only became available recently. You can read more about it here: Move resources to new resource group or subscription 

Create Snapshots before the template is updated. The VMware vSphere tools still consider it to be one template, so creating a virtual machine from snapshot "20131031 02:00" is a tad more involved. Duplicate the Template, so now we have "Windows Server 2012 (20131031)", "Windows Server 2012 (20130331)" and "Windows Server 2012 (20140601)". The tools support this well. We may quickly have a mess, with folks having no clue what is installed on what template. After a template is updated, export it. Only the latest template is available in VMware tools, but I can always restore an old version of the template when there is a problem. 

Assume that you're in an organisation with numerous data centres, each with their own private clouds running on VMware vCenter 5.5. There are VMware templates for different Operating Systems, including Windows, Redhat Linux etc. Lets assume there are two private clouds, C1 and C2. C1 was built a year ago and C2 only recently. Lets assume it runs Windows 2012. The base template was updated several times since C1 was built. For example, the .NET framework was updated from v4.0 to v4.5 and then to v4.5.1. A virtual machine in C1 needs to be rebuilt. However, the software running in that virtual machine is not compatible with .NET v4.5 or v4.5.1. So the only template we have isn't compatible. We have to recreate the template, with an odd chance that some OS patch etc may be installed that causes a problem for the virtual machine. So it seems that it should be a best practice to version templates. What is the best approach? Here's what I tried: 

The server $URL$ has a Commodo certificate. Other download sites use Let's Encrypt certificates. How does one add the root certificates and intermediate certificates of these certificates authorities to vCenter so that I can download ISO images from the internet? I have been looking at documentation and can't find any documentation. 

What are the steps are needed to generalize OpenBSD so that it could be used as a template or virtual appliance without disclosing any information of the environment that baked it, or put the user of the template at risk (for example what happened to GitHub Enterprise)? Using Atlassian Bamboo, I use packer to create a OpenBSD 6.1 VMware vSphere virtual machine template. Another downstream process specializes the OpenBSD template for a specific use. Currently I'm doing the following to truncate the logs 

To illustrate the benefits of digitally signing certificates, I wrote an .NET executable "demo.exe" which calls a function in "demo.core.dll". I digitally signed both executables. When executed, it prints a message "Hello. How are you doing?". The message in "demo.core.dll" was modified to "You've been hacked" with a hex editor. Verification of the digital certificate on "demo.core.dll" fails. Run "demo.exe" which displays "You've been hacked". I expect that Windows will fail to execute the DLL. This negates the value of a digital certificate. How do I configure Windows not to load tampered binaries with invalid certificates? 

I have an vCenter 6.5 server and a Content Library named . I'd like to import CentOS 7.4 from $URL$ But when doing so, the import fails with the following error: 

You may wish to enable offline files for that network location. This will not prevent disconnects but it will give you offline copy to work with even if connection is lost in middle of editing. Once connection is restored, file will be copied back to server and synchronized. Only issue here may be if another user modified that file while connection was down since that would cause synchronize error and you would need to resolve it automatically. 

1) no 2) yes 3) maybe For home server, I would go with desktop motherboard since it is much cheaper. 64-bit drivers were problem for quite a while since desktop motherboard manufacturers didn't bother much. However, if you search for little bit better desktop motherboard with Intel chipset, you cannot go wrong. 

You will not be able to cache Windows Updates in that manner. For cacheing them, check Microsoft's WSUS. 

I would assume that this is issue with drivers. However, IDE has same size limit as SCSI on Hyper-V. Usually IDE disks are a LOT easier to use in Linux and that solves problems with visibility in most cases. In your case that is a problem since you use first Hyper-V Server 2008 release. If you can, I would recommend moving to Hyper-V Server 2008 R2 which will allow you to have big disk on IDE interface and thus avoid any driver issues with Linux and SCSI. P.S. You can just disconnect already existing VHD and re-attach it as IDE since format is not dependent on interface. 

P.S. I know that 89.172.197.320 is not real IP address. I wrote it like that in order not to share mine IP address (or IP address from someone else). P.P.S. Thanks for help to Kronick and Avery Payne since their ideas pushed me in right direction. 

I have Asus WL-500g and I use DD-WRT. I currently have v24 SP1 installed and there are no issues with it. I find it really easy to configure and it supports Asus hardware quite well. Torrenting from it is little bit harder with DD-WRT, but there is support for installing additional packages. VPN is supported just fine. 

NTLDR error can arise for many different things, but fragmentation is not one of them. In this case I would go with "disk failing" reason since, as you noticed, even TrueImage couldn't read it. Since TrueImage reads everything sector-by-sector, it would not mind fragmentation. Try to backup everything you can since I assume that drive will completely fail very soon. Fragmentation will have effect here since it is much harder to recover data from fragmented drive than from non-fragmented one, but it is definitely not the cause. 

You can try using VHD attach. It has option to attach VHD after each boot. Since one part runs as service, no UAC prompt will bother you. 

As far as I know, there are no provisioning in answer file to do it. Answer file contains only settings that you get asked during setup. Page file is not one of them. 

Use BCDEdit to set truncatememory option. That will limit your memory. To use it first check what BCD entries you have with 

You can try DynDns. It will enable you to connect your dynamic IP with your DNS address (given to you by DynDns). It only requires small utility on your side at worst. If you have access to router, it gets even easier since almost all routers have support for it. 

I spun up a Remote Desktop Server instance on Amazon's Virtual Private Cloud service... What's the best/easiest way to print from the VPC to local printers? The local printers are IP based, but not "cloud printers". I'm familiar with how Cloud Printing works for Chrome, but is there a way to install a cloud printer as a regular Windows printer on a Remote Desktop Server and "just have it work?" 

I have two AD servers separated by a T1. Location A, which hosts the primary AD / DNS / Roaming Profiles server is subnet 192.168.0 Location B, which is the secondary AD server (I'm trying to configure but...) is on subnet 192.168.1 I understand this may be a DNS issue. The only DNS server I have assigned to that subnet via DHCP on a Sonicwall is the AD server in Location A. I got positive results from DNS tests in ping and nslookup. I have joined, unjoined, rejoined the domain. All Event Viewer is telling me that the login is taking too long, it took 931 second, it's taking to long to log off, and there's a csc resource cannot be loaded... Is it simply that the profile is too large in size for the T1? I've enabled Folder Redirection - still taking forever, stuck at "waiting for user profile service". Note that this happens on both Win2k8R2 and regular Windows 7 in Location B. Now happening at Location A as well... [Possibly fixed - it may just be raw profile size, even with folder redirection on] What is the best way to troubleshoot this issue? 

I was copying a VM between datastores last night when I looked away and then the vCenter host started restarting due to Windows update... The VM transfer between was aborted, but now the VMDK file it was transferring is locked and I can't start the virtual machine. The Knowledge base articles I've found are too cryptic, I just need to get the vmdk unlocked... How? vCenter / ESXi 5.0 Error: "Unable to access file [NEXSAN_SAS] rds-sv-ent/rds-sv-ent_1.vmdk since it is locked" More Details: "An unexpected error was received from the ESX host while powering on VM vm-261. Reason: Failed to lock the file. Cannot open the disk '/vmfs/volumes/4f4bb0fe-f7daabec-6a41-ac162d73a349/rds-sv-ent/rds-sv-ent_1.vmdk' or one of the snapshot disks it depends on. " 

I lucked out in the case. Upon writing this, the main disk was locked. I removed the VM from inventory and readded it - no good. I vMotioned the VM between hosts and noticed now the main vmdk (OS Drive) wasn't locked, but the ancillary swap drive. I disconnected that and started the VM - good to go. Powered down the VM, reattached the swap drive, 100% ok. These two sites were very helpful: $URL$ $URL$ 

I have Folder Redirection turned on so the profiles are on a Windows shared folder on a File and Print Server... \folders\Profiles I want to back up the entire Profiles directory, but as Domain Admin I don't seem to have the privileges to "select all and copy" the entire directory structure. The user profile subfolders (Appdata, Documents, Desktop, Pictures, etc.) throw access denied errors... I tried to grant Domain Admins full privileges to the Profiles directory and thought the subfolders would inherit the privileges, but I get access denied errors just trying to set the permissions... How can I assign a user to the Profiles directory so that I can copy the entire directory tree to back it up?
