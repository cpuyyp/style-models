Hide it in plain sight. Bury it in a comet, dwarf planet, or small moon. Honestly, would anyone think of looking inside deimos or Ceres for your station? 

It would work much like a giant game of go. Conquest is a matter of cutting off supply lines and making it more worth while to remain a part of the empire than to separate once the land masses have separated again. 

The biggest difference between the ww2 military and modern western militaries is the rise of the professional soldier. I apologize that this is disjointed. I'll clean it up in a day or so. In ww2, soldiers were largely conscripted men, whose long term goal was to get out of the military and back to real life. Most soldiers in the war never fired their guns, and most of those never hit an enemy. The 21st century soldier is a volunteer career soldier, trained to the level of a ww2 commando. The early introduction of post Vietnam management and training practices does not require tech (although tech helps). Can't use laser tag equipment for simulated fire exercises? Bath beads were known in ww2. Load them with paint instead of soap, inventing paint ball, and you can make a decent simulated fire exercise that even incorporates every army's weak spot - logistics. Individual units have more autonomy than their ww2 counterparts. They are given a broad objective within the overall strategy, and then they work out the "how" on their own within the rules of engagement. 

What you are talking about is inducing a degree of alexithymia in your soldiers. In real life, lack of emotion leads to inability to choose a course of action when more than one option is presented, the inability to interpret or respond to normal social cues, inability to follow directions (orders), inability to self regulate. Physiologically, emotion happens in one part of the brain and is interpreted in another party. By severing the connection between those parts of the brain, you can induce the condition. To see what is really like, look at boxers or martial artists that have "taken one too many hits to the head". 

Well, assuming hefty doses of handwavium so the astronauts survive the radiation inherent in a wormhole, I believe it would be possible, although it might take some time. The secret is a total sky galaxy survey, backed up with a corresponding survey from earth such as has been/is being done by HST, Spitzer, and Chandra. Once you positively identify four galaxy matches with their red shifts, you can pinpoint the milky way (even if it's hidden behind another galaxy) and determine how much time has elapsed since you left home to transit the wormhole. I'll let an astronomer do the math for this one. 

As happened in Britain in the 70s, the. People with significant property will leave the country, taking all of the economy they impact (jobs) with them. The country's economy will tank, and after s couple of decades people will find loopholes as they rebuild their lives. Instead of a will, they may hold all properties in LLC's, and the heirs will be designated as officers of the LLC. That fulfills the letter of the ban on inheritance, while allowing the practice to continue. Of course only the very wealthy and connected would have a chance at using those loopholes. 

There's be no civilization as we know it because we wouldn't be here. Iron is a critical nutrient to vertebrate life, necessary for the creation of red blood cells to transport Oxygen throughout the body. Its commonness is why sufficient amounts of it dissolve in soils world wide to be absorbed into plants for us to consume. 

Since mars' atmosphere is thin enough to make a really good analog for hard vacuum in most laboratories here on earth, there isn't any way to get buoyancy for a zeppelin. . 

From a comment chain that got too long and should have been an answer (thanks @jamesqf for the conversation): Using 21st century sustainable industrial farming practices, you will need 4 acres of land per person to keep people fed. If fresh surface water is used for irrigation, the farms should remain productive for a very long time. Since modern industrial farming is built on recovery from the bad practices of the 19th century that led to the dustbowl years and widespread famine, it follows that adherence to the practices improves the soils year after year within the parameters of the indicators that the farmer knows to check and manage. The caveat of "what the farmer knows to check and manage" is crucial. For example, one of the challenges faced by farms that are dependent on well water for irrigation is the trace amounts of salt in the well water build up in the soil over time and poison the land. 21st century agriculture is struggling now with the question of how to economically desalinate soil at scale. If pre-1940 practices are followed, you can expect to require 15 acres of land per person, with the caveat that the soils will be depleted within 150 years +/-, and the city will be forced to either acquire more land or develop farming practices analogous to 20th century industrial farming. This allows no buffer for contingencies (disease, pests, accidents). My town is home to about 50,000 people, and covers 31.67 square miles. It is not incredibly densely populated, but if it were more densely populated I would not want to live here. So, using 21st century level industrial farming, a marginally self sustaining city of 60,000 people will require 375 square miles (a square 19.4 miles to a side) of farmland plus 32 square miles of living and working space. 407 square miles Using 19th century farming practices, a marginally self sustaining city of 60,000 people will require 1406 square miles of farmland plus 32 square miles of living and working space. 1438 square miles Keep in mind that this is marginally sustainable - a bad crop year would wipe out your city, so you would want to double this and have other plans in place for contingency. 

Stealth - this is one of the strategies used by Somali pirates. Make contact with the target in the still of night, quietly place your armed crew around the ship, then round up the ships crew and lock them up. Overwhelming firepower - the odds of survival are less bad if the ships crew surrenders than if they fight. Shock - hit the ship with something hard enough to send the crew into physical shock (bombs), then board while the crew and/or ship is incapacitated. Swarming - this is the strategy the Iranian navy claims to be practicing. Attack a ship with many smaller speed boats, expecting heavy losses, get in too close for them to bring weapons to bear, then board. The more people are involved with repelling boarders, the less they are attacking your swarm.
