The degree of literacy of a certain community of speakers is generally proposed as one of the factors that affect the pace of language change. More specifically, literacy would slow down change, since literate people – most of them speaking the standard variety – tend to conform their speech to the written form. Since spelling, by its nature, tends to remain quite stable over long periods of time, the language itself would remain stable as well. What is the basis for this claim? How do linguists measure the impact that the degree of literacy has on language change? 

So, for example, think is usually pronounced [fĩk], then is pronounced [den] and with, [wif]. Since Brazilian Portuguese does not have dental fricatives, this kind of sound change is much to be expected. What is interesting about it is the regularity of the pattern. Among other "likely" candidates, such as [s] or [t], which are also sounds found in BP, [f] is — almost always — chosen to replace [θ]. Similarly with [ð], that could as well be replaced with [z] or [v]. Even those who have never heard other people speak that way will make this choice. So, my question is: can this sound change be predicted from Brazilian Portuguese phonology? What else could explain its regularity? In general, if a phonologist is presented with two languages, A and B, can they predict what sound changes are most likely to occur if the native speakers of A start speaking B as a second language? 

Whenever I observe my fellow Brazilian countrymen learning to speak English, a clear sound change pattern stands out: 

As far as I know, language families originate from a process of divergent, tree-like evolution. All the languages within a family or subfamily can be traced back to the same proto-language, which was spoken several centuries ago. At some point, the various regions in which that proto-language was spoken started developing their own particular innovations. This process went on and on, to the point that, after some time, they were not mutually intelligible anymore and could thus be considered as “different languages”. But is there any case of the opposite trajectory, i.e., languages that started out very different from each other, then started to converge because of language contact and ended up very similar, much like actual language families? Now, I am aware of the existence of language areas (Sprachbunds), in which languages share several features by virtue of the high level of contact among them. But even in Sprachbunds, languages maintain their familial “identity”, so to speak. In the Balkans, for example, we can talk about Slavic languages, Romance languages, etc. There is no such thing as a “Balkanic familiy”. 

After β-conversion, this will of course be equivalent to my (1c) above, so in that sense it's just as valid a meaning representation. However, the difference is that in my version, we have just one instance of λ-abstraction; in this version, there are two. Which one is more "correct" will depend on the particular mapping from syntax to semantics, i.e. how abstraction arises syntactically and whether we want one such instance or two. Another consideration is that, for (2), the analog of GregLee's answer would be: 

Importantly, (1b) and (2b) β-reduce to the usual (1c) and (2c), respectively. In both cases, we essentially just abstract over the elided thing: "the turkey" in (1), hence with of type (individual), and "bought" in (2), hence with of type (predicate/set of individuals). 

with just parentheses and no periods. For historical reasons that I don't fully understand, using a period to introduce the scope of a λ-binder, e.g. λx.φ, is particularly common (though not universal). 

Once again, must be the functional version of set intersection, but in the λ-calculus, this would actually have a different type than the previous . The first would be of type (intersection of two sets of individuals), while the second would be of type (intersection of two predicates/two sets of sets of individuals). Now, this maybe isn't a very big deal, since you could maybe just define a suitable polymorphic operator, or a family of such operators. But the nice thing about my version is that both cases rely on just one abstraction followed by normal boolean conjunction (∧). 

Notice that the two 's are bound by two different λ-operators. Thus, this is fact equivalent (switching now to my notation above) to: 

The semicolon in ∀;y is surely a typo. It should just be ∀y, just like the ∀x that precedes it. A period is often used to introduce the scope of a variable binding expression like ∀x, e.g. ∀x.φ. By convention, the scope stretches all the way to the end of the entire expression. So, for example, in ∀x.Px ∧ Qx, the occurrence of x in Qx is bound by ∀x. That is, it's not equivalent to Qx ∧ ∀x.Px (by convention). Some authors instead delimit the scope with square brackets or parentheses, e.g. ∀x[φ] or ∀x(φ), while others don't use anything at all, e.g. ∀xφ. (In the latter case, complex expressions like Px ∧ Qx are defined recursively to contain brackets, e.g. (Px ∧ Qx), which by convention are dropped only when no confusion arises. For quantified expressions, this then yields ∀x(Px ∧ Qx), so that the scope of ∀x is automatically clear.) The author that you quote seems to use a combination of a period and parentheses. This is basically a case of redundancy: assuming by convention that a scope introduced by a period stretches all the way to the right, it would be just a clear to write 

In English and other Germanic languages, noun compounds are formed simply by “appending” the nouns in a certain order. For example, phrases like this are very common: 

There are several processes of change that affect spoken languages, including phonological and phonetic change, semantic change and lexical replacement. Each of these categories, in turn, comprise a large set of complex phenomena, such as all the types of phonological change (epenthesis, elision, metathesis and so on). In any case, all spoken languages undergo the same processes, although at different rates, with different results etc. Is this also true for signed languages? That is, are signed languages affected by the same processes – albeit "translated", so to speak, to the domain of signs and facial expressions – that affect spoken languages? 

During the course of their development, the word order of some languages change. Examples include Latin (SOV) that changed to SVO in the Romance languages, Proto-Austronesian (verb initial) that changed to SVO in most modern Austronesian languages, and the Insular Celtic languages, that developed VSO word order. How common is this phenomenon in the history of languages? 

Are these arguments generally accepted among linguists? How much of this is "good science" and how much is just "pop science"? * In the sense of a single language from which all other languages of the world came out. ** The first version of this question contained the expression "direct ancestor". But, as was pointed out in the answers and comments, this is not an appropriate term. 

Among the descendants of the Latin word sic ("thus, so, or just like that"), only the Portuguese word sim ends with a nasal consonant. Actually, in modern Portuguese, it ends with a nasal vowel, [sĩ], which must have developed from [sim] by assimilation. Compare this with its "sister" words, taken from the Wiktionary, which have all dropped the final [k]: 

In Portuguese, Spanish and probably other Romance languages, this kind of compounding has to be done with the aid of prepositions. The translation of the phrase above to Portuguese is: 

As I understand from the principles and parameters theory, all parameters are binary. In particular, the head directionality parameter can be set to either "head-first" or "head-last". The setting of one value or the other determines, among other things, which kind of adposition the language will have. Head-first generates prepositions (e.g. English). Head-last generates postpositions (e.g. Japanese). But Finnish is an example of language that has both prepositions and postpositions. What am I missing? 

The Icelandic language is often used as an example of a very conservative language, compared to other Indo-European languages, in general, and to other North-Germanic languages, in particular, all of which have changed a lot over the past few centuries. The retainment of its complex inflectional morphology since the Middle Ages is part of the evidence presented in support of its conservatism. It is often claimed that modern Icelandic speakers can even read the Icelandic Sagas (written about 800 years ago) with just a bit of extra effort. So, first of all, is Icelandic that conservative, as claimed? If so, what explains such phenomenon?
