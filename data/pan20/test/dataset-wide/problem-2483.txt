"(...) not only Alaro Kalamo has faith/conviction, persistence, mindfulness... Also I have faith/conviction, persistence, mindfulness... (...)" Access to Insight, MN 26, Thanissaro Bhikku 

Don't know; but it's just what is pleasing me. Also it helps to organize my view of things to the more relaxed one. Evolutionary benefit ? Why not... 

I think, the best answer here is "you cannot be sure". It's a tradition from which you heard it. However, you can try to get familiar with that what has also been transmitted about the practize and the teaching of the Buddha. If you find out that -by following the proposed path- you get a little bit nearer to understanding, freedom-in-thought, awareness, mindfulness, compassion ... then you might become more convinced . Such thing is even a many-times reported experience, which can be found many times in the suttas but also in the whole evolution of the buddhist practice and experience up to today. But when you'll become sure - that shall be a very individual, personal moment which cannot, in my opininion, ever be formalized as a general rule (perhaps even in some bureaucratic/scientific or the-like account). (a nice composition about this is in @ruben2020 's answer) 

This answer is not about the ["my son"-or-not] part, but about a monk which developed later as a "fake monk" (your term, I think it is not the best here for my example). Would the story about Devadatta(wiki,accesstoinsight.org, palikanon.com) fit your question? Devadatta was a long time much respected bhikkhu, part of the sangha, but then built community with the son (Ajatasattu (?)) of the local king Bimbisara (the latter a friend of the Buddha) to overtake the order resp. the kingdom (the latter was successful for Ajatasattu). One sutra is for instance A 5.100 in German in english, but there are several ones which -in my view- together show how the Buddha handled that problem. 

1) I think there is no "restriction" or prerequisite (like for instance a system of permits) for mindfulness-meditation. Just try and see how far you come. However, the Buddha said, (and it is quite reasonable for me) that for the full liberation from the attachments to emotions and mental figurations, and for the true emancipation from (and eradication of) tanha , the illusion of an inherent, eternal, unchangeable Self atma has necessarily to be dissolved. 

I don't hink there is a canonical answer in the Pali-canon about the "why". But in the books of Thich Nhat Hanh which I accept as quite authoritative there is an explanation in the following spirit (don't have the exact text at hand): at one hand the monks shall not be concerned with the common daily life and samsara and what else and thus should -in priciple- should stay with the common samanas'/ascetics' practice. However, to avoid the danger that the monks become too remote from the society, from the human world(so to say) they should somehow remain in contact. Derived from this that has two intertwined advantages: the monks give the people the chance to try and experience wideheartedness so they help them to train wholesome emotions, thoughts and practice, and even help them to simple stay aware of the existence of the Buddha's sangha, teachings and doctrine - and the monks themselves don't loose the contact with that from where they come from, with their own history and samsaric relations and don't become, for instance, hypocrites (the latter is a word from me, I don't really think that Thich Nhat Hanh had used this expression). All in all, I find this a nice and very helpful interpretation - but as I said in the first sentence: I've no idea at the moment whether and where the Buddha might have been given such an explicite explanation of the "why" . 

Because this question came up on the mainpage again, just another thought. You can't know it, you only can believe it. I think similar situations in the samana discourse have been the reason for the convention of the "Lion's roar" . That seems to be one possibility to announce such a thing like "awakening" that was not on the disposal of the outer world. The outer world could only believe/or not or try to disprove by showing that the content of the "Lion's roar" of someone could be disproved factual and/or by outcome in that real practice. So there is one sutra, I think it is the MN12 showing the "Lion's roar" of the Buddha, but there is also another sutra (don't have the source at the moment) where this is only a part and only expressed shorter; but there is also one sutra about Sariputta's "Lions-roar" which the Buddha probed when asked him "by what do you know that your master is enlightened/behaving enlightened?" I think that term occurs somewhere else casually in the PK and I'm sure some discussion of it should be in contemporary literature, and possibly wikipedia, because of it being a feature of the widespread samana's culture. 

Note, that this sutra (at least in its translation) refers in its text to itself , similar to a platform of a political party... 

Additional remark: for me things like those (the appearance of new ideas later in history, and for instance the idea of attacking people because they disparage the sutra and reject its teachings) are strong signals/markers/alarms that something is beginning to go wrong with the transmission of the dharma (I didn't see something similar in the palicanon-suttas) So I don't think, the idea of enlightnenment-disabled people is not historic in the palicanon. 

When I was on holiday at my sisters's place aside a forest in Finland I had my best meditation-practices in my early years of practice. That what you might call "distracting" was soft: a soft wind , some insect making a little noise - it even helped to step outside of the "focusing objects"-mood of the mind and to fall into the detached "being-aware". Of course, there is a limit for the loudness - especially for the beginner that I was, but happily it was always below that level when I have been there. In my hometown it is much more difficult for me to stay in meditation when sounds distract/disturb, perhaps that sounds are more aggressive. I remember, however, when I was a child and have been at my grandma's there was a big wooden clock softly clicking and sometimes a sound from the tram two streets away - and which as well helped to flow into a deep peaceful meditative and still aware state. I like the answer of Samana Johann where he says "When ever there is a remote forest left, there is still a "birthplace" for another Arahat." That's really a nice observation, indeed! 

I have a problem with that -in my feeling- contradictory translations of a remark in MN26. While K.E.Neumann uses an expression like "(...) not even Alaro Kalamo has (...), but I have (...) " Kay Zumwinkel translates: " not only Alaro Kalamo has (...), but also I have (...)" The Zumwinkel's version is also compatible with the english version by Thanissaro Bhikku at AtI.org (still the focus of the sentence is a bit shifted). But the two other versions suggest that Neumann has an error here. But of what type is the error with respect to the original? Is the expression in the original ambiguous (look at the additional tiny discrepancy between Zuminkel and Thanissaro)? Or is there some other reason why Neumann could possibly have made that translation which could be a bit more sensical than a simple error? 

(If in fact that is the relevant Pali-expression, then at least the form seems to be preserved by the translation of K.E. Neumann as far as I can regognize the pattern of sentences) 

We seem not to be surprised, that, for instance, skiing is joyful and motion/sports is making peaceful in general, according to the doctors. Is skiing meaningful through an evolutionary model? (I'm taking your terms without really wanting to use that language & concept - but just for the moment...) 

As far as I understood, the (Mahayana-) Mahaparinirvana-Sutra was composed some generations after the Buddha's death; but it might be interesting that it contains the new, previously unknown, notion of "icchantica(s)" - people who are not able to become enlightended because they are so ... evil? stupid? compassionless? (Don't know the exact idea). 

On the other hand, the amount of text is rather large, so perhaps, if someone would really try, some patterns might be discernible and separatable to different authorship. So what is so far possible is to look-out for terms, which were not known to the Buddha, because they came up centuries later. Or for rather obvious deviations from the main teachings in concept and style. Here can likely be said something already. Unfortuately without a reliable analysis tool this is rather subjective, and someone who wants to insert texts/thoughts into the Buddha's teaching and even to attribute this to the Buddha would surely challenge you, to prove your assumption of fabrication... Subjective example: in an "encounter" some years ago I was confronted with the Mahayana-version of the Great Parinirvana-sutra. Reading this I felt a lot of sentences being nearly hate-speech against the "iccantika"s, against the "non-believers", heretics; in many places I found the style of a talk being competitive with others, and found records about numbers of people attending the burial-ceremony as given with "millions", "billions" - for me seemingly just simply born out of a drunken delirium of the writer. But prove that that impressions indicate fabrication... Subjective again: there is a certain stand in the attribution of Palicanon-suttas to the Buddha and to later redaction, but for me this is in moderate, usually neglectable amount - so I have not really looked at this systematically. I'm curious, though, what next years might bring us, in presence of always better pattern-detection-software - textanalysis is already beginning to become spectcular...
