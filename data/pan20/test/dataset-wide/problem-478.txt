First, good on ya. I'm 50, and I got back into cycling 9 years ago. I still remember my first Club Ride in 2012. It was about 12 miles, and I thought I would die. Today, I bike commute mostly year round, 5 miles each way, I do Club Rides of upwards of 60 miles, and I've done two Century Rides. Look around for a Bike Club near you and consider joining. I find that riding with others is a great way to push myself more. As my Ride Leader says, the secret to hills is riding more hills. 

Single speed bikes tend to be very low end bikes--aside from fixies, but those are a different animal altogether. As such, you almost certainly will want a multispeed bike. Don't get too focused on having a specific number of gears. Instead, focus on a bike that meets your needs. For commuting, you'll mainly be looking at commuter bikes and road bikes, and you'll likely be looking at a derailer bike with at least 16 gears. Visit some local bike shops with absolutely ZERO intention of buying something that day. Depending upon where you live, the selection of shops may range from great to sparse. Get a feel for the place and how they treat you. The customer experience will range from great to awful. I strongly urge that you stay away from big box stores and only shop at local bike shops. You will have a far better selection of bikes at a local bike shop, and service is non-existent at big box stores. What's available at bike shops in your area may be completely different from what's available in my area. As such, it's impossible for anyone on the Internet to make specific recommendations. It's best if you look at the inventory of bikes in shops in your area. Something that you have to custom order or drive 100 miles to pick up adds a lot of unnecessary expense and hassle. 

I'm a year round commuter, and here in the Pacific Northwet it is often dark on the ride both to and from work during the winter. While I've been considering a hub generator for my commuter, I don't think I can really justify the cost. If I went touring on multi-day rides [or won the lottery], then yes I would get a hub generator [or generators]. Most of the battery powered lights I use take rechargeable AA or AAA batteries. My main headlight, a Light and Motion Urban 800 FC, recharges from a USB cable and it seriously lights up the road when it's dark out. L&M Urbans are falling in price. I also have a few "I'm here" lights that take lithium button batteries, and which could not be replaced with hub lights. As @dlu said, Peter White is an awesome source, but I think I would look for a local source first. The investment is significant, and fit/compatibility issues could seriously drive up the price if you have to ship parts to and fro. 

We don't get nearly the snow in Washington that they get in New Hampshire, but it does hit now and again. $URL$ 

While we do not have Idaho Rules here in Washington, there has been a push for it at times. A "dead red" law took effect for cyclists earlier this year, but that's a far cry from Idaho Rules. 

Depending upon the crankset, you may be able to simply remove one or two chainrings. However, it is unlikely that any one or two of your existing chainrings would provide either efficient or optimal gearing, depending upon your goals. You would likely need new chainrings, assuming you could find chainrings that bolt to your crankset. If not, then you would need a new crankset. It's likely your front derailer would work with a double. Also, you would likely want a new left shifter, assuming you went to a double. As others have asked, what is your goal? 

Bike shops from one area to the next can be as different as oranges and orangutans. The same can be true of bike shops within a given area. Here in the "Olympia Washington Metroplex", there are seven bike shops: Deschutes (on Custer), Deschutes (on 4th), Joy Ride, Old Town, Bike Tech, Falcones, REI There are a couple of different bike collectives: Evergreen College Bike Shop, Build A Bike, Intercity Transit's program (which is aimed at kids). There are also a couple of bike builders here in town, but that's probably off topic from what you want. Falcones, I'm told, can be a good place to find previous year's models still sitting in boxes--sometimes bikes from 10 or more years ago. I got a previous year's model for my son at REI 2 years ago, and I've seen previous year's models for sale at most of the local shops. Deschutes specializes in used bikes and upgrades, so they are my shop of choice. Some of this information might be found online at BikeForums, Yelp, etc. However, the best way to find it out is by visiting the local shops. Go to Google Maps, enter "bike shops in " without the quotes. Check out their hours, make a day of it, and visit them all. Go in without any plan to buy. Just visit, see what they've got, get a feel for the place. Some places might rub you wrong. Others might feel like they were put there to serve you. 

Cost would have to be the biggest obstacle. Several hundred dollars to retrofit a system, assuming it is impeccably reliable, might be an insignificant expense to someone riding a $7,000 titanium custom bike, but it's an insurmountable sum for someone riding a Craigslist beater bike because it's what they can afford. For new bikes, let's presume that mass production would take the cost down to $100. Once again, for the person buying a $6,000 cromoly lugged custom bike, it's nothing to tack on $100. For the person shopping at a Big Box Store, they aren't going to tack on $100 for a brake light when they're only looking to spend $150 to $250 on a bike. If I set aside cost, I would have to express my skepticism that a brake light offers any significant improvement in safety. I run 10 lights on my commuter: 4 tail lights, 2 head lights, and 4 spoke lights. I have my eye on additional lights to improve visibility--head, tail, and side--but brake lights aren't even on my radar. 

Here are a couple of links you can check out and gauge for yourself if it's something you want to tackle. This is kinda towards the deep end of the pool. $URL$ 

Derailer cables operating an indexed derailer wear out much faster than brake cables, and in fact brake cables can go a long time before needing replacement. However, while a broken derailer cable is inconvenient, a broken brake cable is dangerous. I would replace it right away. Brake cable replacement, including the labor, is cheap--certainly when compared to the cost of an ER visit. 

It depends, and upon a number of things. I blew three spokes on a 27" Weinmann wheel in April, and I think I commuted for 3 days on it before I realized that I'd blown the spokes. Weinmann wheels have an excellent reputation, including those from a 1986 Schwinn. However, there is a rule that old wheels are no match for old bikes and old bicyclists. In looking at the wheel and spokes, LBS mechanic [whom I know and trust] said that metal fatigue was the culprit. I could have paid to get the spokes replaced, but I'd be gambling that I'd blow another spoke in a week or two. I decided instead to pull the 27" wheel from my wife's old road, a 1989 Schwinn, have it mounted, and the wheel trued. I rode on it until mid June--when I blew a spoke on that wheel and the rim bent badly enough that the tire rubbed on the chain stay. Eventually, I bought a new wheel, and upgraded from a bolt-on to a quick release, which produced a bit of extra cost. If the wheel is "older", get a new wheel.
