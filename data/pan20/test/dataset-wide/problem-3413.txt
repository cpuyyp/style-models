You see that sometimes. It isn't common, but it does happen. A way to think about it is there being two different supply curves of deposits. It is usually reversed and larger deposits earn more. This is for two reasons. First, wealthier investors have less tendency to let inertia determine where their accounts are and so are willing to more elastically supply funds and the variable costs of adding a single account are independent of the size of the account. However, there are environments where banking accounts are the single best investment option possible. In that case, those large deposits cannot flee into the bond or stock markets. Furthermore, the banks may be desirous to reduce their deposit levels, but not lose their customer base. This would encourage wealthier depositors to consume their money rather than deposit it. Banks may want to reach target funding levels that are slightly lower than their current level. Finally, certain types of assets can imply certain preferred types of deposits. For example, banks that offer a significant number of lines of credit, letters of credit or other forms of contingent funding usually carry a lot of demand deposits and fewer long term deposits. Conversely, banks that carry longer term loans tend to carry longer term deposits. The mix of banks assets may be changing. Finally, Brexit will probably crush British commerce and if banking is preparing for this, they may be shortening their asset base and in doing so trying to shorten their deposit base to be flexible in the event that Brexit is as catastrophic as it could be. The Port of London is huge because the Industrial Revolution began there and so outflowing trade required it, but as other nations joined the process it became natural to use London as the nexus of trade between the Old World and the New World. When the European customs union came into existence this substantially reduced the competitive value of ports such as Antwerp. If customs duties are now present, it is unimaginable that customers selling to Europe from North or South America would even consider shipping through London to Europe, if the principal European ports were large enough to handle the traffic. Because of history, they are not yet, but when they become so all the supporting commerce such as warehouses, banks, trucking companies and makers of intermediate goods for final shipment to Europe should get crushed. Banks may be getting ready. 

It is problematic to use as a word. Some of the better authors in the last one hundred years have defined it, but there is no consistent definition. I provide an operational definition for a narrow purpose in a paper as those possessing risk-loving preferences. That definition, of course, would exclude many traders. I use it with reference to implications for prudential regulation, but I didn't need to measure it for what I was doing as their presence or absence didn't impact the empirical component. The problem of talking about "speculators," aside from the definition problem, is that it is not a behavior. Indeed, it's not meaningful. Imagine seeing a newspaper article about a plane crash, and "gravity" was blamed. Excluding planes flying into mountains, how useful would it be to discuss the effects of gravity on planes instead of mechanical failure causing gravity to suddenly become more meaningful? I can think of possible ways to mathematically segregate speculative behavior if you can clearly state what you mean by the word, but I would really want to ground that in a model so it would very clear what the predictions might be. However, I can also imagine definitions where central banks could fall into that categorization in some cases so rigor will be both difficult and require a clear statement that it is an operational definition and not a canonical definition. In the housing market, I doubt it could be readily measured because the measures in the housing market are so easily manipulated and there are plenty of incentives to manipulate. That may not be true in the Canadian system, but in the American system, particularly with REITs, there is just a ton of ways to play games. I think you would want a tamer market, such as equities, to build test runs of a methodology. 

I think I can explain the problem as to why the schools persist. For simplicity we will limit ourselves to the Marxist, Austrian, Neoclassical and Neo Keynsian schools. I am not sure where to put the Feminist school except under the broad heading of heterodox with Marxists and Austrians as I don't think of it as a school so much as an attitude or direction of thinking. The same thing would be true for Green economics, it isn't so much a school as a domain. There are many small groups out there. For starters, economics is a broad umbrella that prefers dissent and maybe even vocal and extensive dissent. Part of economics is part of the humanities and part of economics is in the sciences. Austrian economics as thought through by von Mises argues that there can be no way to measure what they are saying and so they are part of the humanities. The neoclassical and the neo Keynesian school say any claim that is stated should be measurable and falsifiable, so it is in the sciences. That said, any serious review of von Mises and related writers would tend to drive one down the path well laid by Leonard Jimmie Savage and his personalistic statistics and in doing so would have a complete empirical methodology. I believe the branch of the Austrian school that says things cannot be measured simply hasn't read enough statistics. The two primary schools, the modern Keynesian and Classical forms, are empirical and the reason you cannot rule one out is that both are empirically supported even though they are contradictory. This is similar to the problem between quantum physics and relativistic physics. They make contradictory assertions. It is impossible that both are true, except where they don't overlap. Yet they both work everywhere else. The best tool for model selection in that it is both disciplined and founded on well understood mathematical principles is Bayesian model selection. Non-Bayesian methods assume that you know the null model and you assert the model is true. This works great for binary problems but is terrible for non-binary problems. If we define a model space as indexed on the set $I$, with $i\in{I}$ and a set of models, $M$, so that $\mathcal{M_i}\in{M}$ and with vectors of parameters $\theta_i\in\Theta_i$ in a parameter space $(\theta_i,\mathcal{M}_i)\in\Theta\times{M}$ then we can solve the problem of the best model. Best in this case being understood as being most probably close to the data generating function. The probability that a model is the true model, from a set of models and given a data set, $X$, is $$\Pr(\mathcal{M_i}|X)=\int_{\theta_i\in\Theta_i}\frac{\Pr(X|\theta_i;\mathcal{M}_i)\Pr(\theta_i;\mathcal{M}_i)}{\sum_{\mathcal{M}_i\in{M}}\int_{\theta_i\in\Theta_i}\Pr(X|\theta_i;\mathcal{M}_i)\Pr(\theta_i;\mathcal{M}_i)\mathrm{d}\theta_i}\mathrm{d}\theta_i$$. While this methodology works generally and works especially well on a problem by problem basis it won't answer which school is best since it will provide contradictory solutions across specific problems. What is really needed is a better, overarching explanation of what triggers Keynesian-like effects and what triggers Classical-like effects. My suspicion is that it is stochastic shocks in the planetary budget constraint compared to where that constraint is expected to be at by the individual actors. 

It is a legal issue, originally. The US did have a giant electrified trolly system built around the coal and diesel-electric train system. This was a primary method to sell electricity before the Great Depression. When Congress decided to do mass electrification they guaranteed generation and sales monopolies but required firms to sell off all non-generation related businesses. The primary buyers of the trolly systems were the automotive makers, who immediately shut them down. While there was some electrification early in the 20th century, mostly in response to legal issues with smoke generation, the change in technologies eliminated this need. Also, by the time the US finally electrified its grid, it has a well established diesel-electric train network. There is an economic issue, however. The US hasn't had its housing or industrial base destroyed since the Civil War and there, only in the south. Rail lines were set to be optimal for the construction and land use of the 19th century, well before electrification or mass transit. Europe, on the other hand, has suffered multiple catastrophic eliminations of its physical plant. This has allowed for the laying of rail in ways not possible in the US without mass condemnation of land, hence the US lacks any type of bullet train. The same is true for electrification of trains. It would require a massive reverse engineering of the existing system. Rail, in the US, often travels places that people do not live. The Hi-Line is a good example of a train route that has very few people on the entire route. Trains can travel at relatively high speeds because there are no people in the middle to slow it down to allow for automotive traffic. Because there are no people, there is also no power system to support it, except incidentally where it hits settled areas. It would be possible to create a long electrical system for this one customer, but why? Another likely issue is that there are multiple competing railroads that use each others' tracks. They rent them. If one electrified, but the others did not, then no one would be able to use the electrified tracks without serious modification. Even if all electrified, they would have to do so to the same standards. There are several small roads too in the US. Look at $URL$ The persisting existence of small lines implies that the economies of scale are such that they can thrive. Electrification requires a large capital investment compared to a diesel-electric train. There would have to be some national impetus to move these small companies down that path when they do not have to take the risk that they will not recover their investments down the road. 

Non-electronic transactions in paper USD do not create US jurisdiction unless one of the parties has a tie to the United States. All American fall under US jurisdiction at all times, everywhere. The only paper transactions which would have automatic US involvement would be in counterfeiting. If a Bolivian and an Argentian are standing in London and one buys a hamburger from another for a paper dollar, the US has no standing if a crime were committed. 

The situation you describe, one with negative nominal rates, only can happen with the use of force or where the instrument acts as an insurance policy. In the case where the instrument serves as an insurance policy, the implicit premium is that negative rate. To consider why this is the case, consider two investments. The first investment provides an $\alpha$ percent rate of return where $-100\%<\alpha<0$. Now consider holding a bank note that pays a zero percent rate of return. Bank notes have, at times, paid positive rates of return. Let us assume that we have perfect foreknowledge of future deflation and we know that both will provide a positive real rate of return. The bank note would always dominate the negative rate of return. No one would invest in the security that provided negative nominal returns unless they believed the banknote itself was suspect. There are two ways this dominates. First, the note provides a higher real rate of return. Second, however, the banknote will do a better job at preserving its value even under an assumption of future inflation because it pays a higher nominal rate, which is zero percent. The banknote is both more valuable and simultaneously less risky. As to the second part of your thinking, that banks would run out of liquidity, you are in error. The reverse would happen. As banks buy fewer bonds, they become less leveraged and intrinsically are more flexible and liquid. Banks become fragile so that their customers can be flexible. If there are no offers to borrow from the bank at advantageous rates to the bank, then the bank builds reserves instead. So the banks should be more liquid. Of course, this does imply that commerce will become less liquid. It would imply that access to liquidity would be more costly than normal as banks want nominal returns to at least cover costs plus an economic profit on those costs. What is an issue is whether or not deflation triggers an exchange between debt and equity investing. The least risky projects can no longer be financed with debt or equity. It could be asked, "does deflation make the entire system increasingly risky with the passage of time?" Are there situations that are unwise for the system, though individually rational for each separate actor? There is also a question of sectoral transfers. Does commerce transfer profit from itself to banks to preserve treasury operations and basic liquidity functions?
