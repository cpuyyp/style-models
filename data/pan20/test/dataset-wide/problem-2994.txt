The short answer to both questions is "no". Weber clearly defined rationalization as a historical process of social change, not an attribute of things or ideas. Weber actually identified multiple forms of rationality (patterns of thought) and rationalization (patterns of social organization) that could potentially come into conflict or contradict one another. 

So we should not simply treat analytic philosophy in particular as if it were identical with theoretical rationality in general. Analytic philosophy is an originally Anglo-American tradition that not only emphasizes the value of theoretical rationality, but develops and applies it in particular ways. One defining feature of most analytic philosophy is that its formal logic, following Aristotle, assumes a logical binary of true and false. It has been proposed that an alternative approach to formal logic can be found in the Buddhist tradition. Whether or not this would count as "analytic philosophy" might be open to interpretation. 

Adam Smith, David Ricardo and even Karl Marx can all be described as political economists. Many professional economists today (but far from most) still engage with a political economy perspective, even though it is no longer the dominant approach. It's worth noting that in the opening remarks of a famous lecture Max Weber referred to himself and his audience as "we political economists." So even in the early 20th century, at least in Germany, the divisions between economics, political science and sociology as separate disciplines was not so rigid as they are today. There are still many self-described political economists in academia, but they have mostly been pushed to the margins of the other disciplines. The original question specifically asks about violence. The role of so-called extra-economic coercion is an important theme in political economy, especially for Marxists. In the first volume of Marx's Capital there is a section (Part VIII) which is called "Primitive Accumulation". This section is basically one long critique of how Adam Smith overlooked the role of violence and coercion in making the modern social division of labor possible. In addition to the primitive accumulation of capital, imperialism and unfree labor remain major topics in Marxian political economy. 

In this example, there are 900 units of profit and 0 units of surplus value. That can happen. But in the dynamic context of a capitalist economy, it will not last very long. The logical reason for this is very simple. Other capitalists will compete with the owner of this incredibly efficient machine. Many will start buying or producing them for themselves. In turn, the value of the commodity that is being produced will fall and fall as more and more units are produced more cheaply. The price of the commodity cannot stay at 900 units in a competitive market, because someone will be willing to charge 800. The price will go down and down until the profit approaches zero. So to restate this in more analytical terms... When profits exceed surplus value, this is a form of rent. Technical innovations are a temporary source of rent for the innovator. As the technology is widely adopted, competition increases, rent decreases, and rate of profits are pushed down in line with rates of exploitation (surplus value). Other common sources of rent include political protections and subsidies, natural resources, etc. The gap between surplus value and profit is related to a more general disconnect between value (meaning the labor time necessary for production) and price (the money paid according to the market dynamics of supply and demand). Trying to understand exactly how prices relate to values is commonly referred to in Marxian theory as "the transformation problem". 

Marx is writing a critique of political economy here, so he is primarily concerned with the theory of value, not "things" in general. Fetishism in general (as opposed to the fetishism of commodities in particular) is an ancient way of thinking, not something new, and Marx clearly recognizes that. Similarly, Marx never suggests that greed and avarice were invented by capitalism. It is a mistake in my opinion (although a common one) to generalize or extrapolate too much from Marx's ideas into the realms of culture, psychology, etc. When we "take an origin of the industrial revolution back to the John Key's flying shuttle" we focus on the material forces of production, rather than the social relations of property and production. That precisely misses Marx's point here. For him, technological improvement is the result rather than the origin of modern capital. What, then is its origin? It's the seperation of direct producers from the means of production, which Marx discusses in the chapter on "so-called primitive accumulation". Land became a commodity, peasants were dispossesed of their livlihood. They now had to purchase commodities in order to survive. This was a pre-condition, already taking place in England before what we think of as the Industrial Revolution. The very essence of commodity fetishism is to forget that the unique "freedom" afforded by commodity exchange is premised on the underlying relations of coercion and exploitation. Forms of commodity exchange have existed for thousands of years if not longer. But before modern capitalism, there has never been a society in which commodity exchange was the central principle of social reproduction. Venice was an exceptional and early case of city-state ruled by a powerful merchant elite, with a high level of autonomy from the church and the aristocracy. In that sense, it was a society characterized by commodity exchange. In some sense, you could certainly extend Marx's concept of commodity fetishism to that context. But today, the fetishism of commodities is much more pervasive and deeply-rooted then in any previous human society. Marx sees the Industrial Revolution as the turning point because it was then that labor-power in general was commodified to such an extent that capitalism became a "mode of production" in its own right, fully independent of feudalism. 

As mentioned in the comments, formalism in philosophy is strongly associated with the Anglo-American tradition of analytic philosophy. This term is widely understood in opposition to continental philosophy. Although the latter term encompasses a wide range of traditions, much of which pre-date modern analytic philosophy as such, they almost all contradict the formalization of analytical philosophy in some fundamental way. As the Wikipedia article on continental philosophy highlights, they generally emphasize the limits of scientific knowledge and the importance of context and experience. As for more direct and explicit critiques of formalism, there are some. For example, see "The Phenomenological Critique of Formalism: Responsibility and the Life-World" by Učník et al. (2004). 

For this reason, I think you will not find Marx or Marxists saying very much about human "individuals" as such. From a Marxian perspective, our common sense understanding and experience of existence as human individuals is a bit misleading, as it conceals the unity described above. 

Given the position you are starting from, I think the best thing to read would be an engaging but broad overview of economic thought. That way you can better decide what interests you to read next. And it wouldn't hurt to read a tried-and-true classic. The Worldly Philosophers by Robert Heilbroner would seem to fit the bill well. (I hasten to add thought that I haven't actually had the chance to read it personally!) It was written in the early 1950s, but has a "modern" focus, starting from Adam Smith and continuing up to Joeseph Schumpeter. If you look at this book on Amazon it will link you to a number of other books on very similar lines. Especially if you want something more up-to-date (not to suggest that Heilbroner's is in any way outdated), it would be well worth browsing through those. 

It should be further emphasized though that Marx's anti-positivism (that is, his opposition to the unqualified and uncritical application of positivist methodology to understanding historical phenomenon) was fundamental to his method. McCarthy is correct that the embrace of positivism by many Marxists, 

So Marx's theory of simple reproduction explains that the circuit of capital must always stay in motion. Note here that the opposite of circulation is basically the "hoarding" of wealth. Capitalists don't hide their money under they mattress, because then they won't make a profit. They keep it circulation by reinvesting it in production (or at least putting it in a bank that can isssue loans). Hoarding (or non-productive investments, like in a real estate bubble) is a basic sign or symptom of an economic crisis. This is where Keynes draws from Marx, although his basic understanding fo the process is very different. Marx's theory of expanded reproduction gets to the other part of the question, which is economic growth. And for Marx, decisively, this is not just a mere appearance of growth, but an accumulation of value-in-circulation. Picture an electrical circuit where the voltage tends to increase more and more over time. The source of the metaphorical "energy" in the capitalist economic system, for Marx, is human labor. It is the only commodity capable of adding additional new value to the circuit of commodities. The value of machinery and represents previous human labor accumulated in a productive physical form, and that is also part of what allows the scale of circulation to increase over time. The other kind of circulation Marx touches on, but does not develop in very much detail, is metabolism, that is, the circulation of matter and energy in general, regardless of whether it is commodified. Humans in every society, like all living beings, take water, food, oxygen, sunlight, use it for our own biophysical reproduction, and then turn it into waste. In a health ecoystem, every form of "waste" is potnetially a necessary input for some other lifeform(s). This kind of circulation goes on regardless of whether or not nature is commodified. But the expanded reproduction of capial tends to disrupt circulation of matter and energy through ecosystems. It produces more waste (pollution, greenhouse gases, etc.) then the biosphere can manage to circulate. The circulation of commodities and the circulation of useful matter do not always fit well together. Ecological Marxists refer to this problem as the metabolic rift. 

While the Wikipedia article on economic reproduction is kind of a mess, that seems to be the concept that this question is grasping at. I'll quote the following which is actually a very nice summary of Marx's answer. 

Engagement with modern analytic philosophy outside the Anglo-American world is indeed limited and relatively recent, but far from non-existent. See, for example, the Tokyo Forum for Analytic Philosophy. A central feature of analytic philosophy (as opposed to continental European as well as non-Western traditions) is that it emphasizes theoretical rationality (as opposed to practical rationality). The assertion made in the question that clarity and rigor are universal values that exist in every human culture is hinted at by sociologist Max Weber's discussion of theoretical rationality. 

It might be helpful to refer here to The Genderbread Person, a popular model for thinking about sex, gender and related concepts. (I've linked to the original, simple version but you can find several more complex iterations on the same website if you want.) 

Gender identity: (what a person feels they are) Gender expression (how a person is perceived) Biological sex (morphology, genetics, hormone levels, etc.) Sexual orientation (attraction, desire, etc.) 

Marx followed what we might call a relational epistemology and ontology. To quote a glossary definition of "subject and object" from Marxists.org: 

In every existing society that we know of, there are variations between individuals in relation to these four elements. On the one hand, this means sex and gender are fundamental elements of human experience. Outside a very strong tabula rasa interpretation of human nature, gender identity and gender expression are inevitable consequences of biological sex. On the other hand, there are very wide variations in the specific content of peoples' gender identities and expressions according to historical and sociological contexts. Many societies recognize the existence of genders outside the male/female binary. While European cultures have tended to have a more rigid approach to gender roles and sexual identities, there have been strong trends towards flexibility and individual choice in recent decades. There is no reason to think such trends cannot continue. 

Here's a review of two major books that deal with current trends in automation from a Marxist perspective. These books are PostCapitalism: A Guide to Our Future by Paul Mason and Inventing the Future: Postcapitalism and a World without Work by Nick Srnicek and Alex Williams. A key point raised by both of these works is that the consequences of automation will depend on whether they are accompanied by a universal basic income.
