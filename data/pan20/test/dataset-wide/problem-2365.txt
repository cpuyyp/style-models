I think understanding how pain is dealt with in general in the suttas might illuminate how one should approach it during sitting (or non-sitting) meditation. The general teaching that I think most schools share towards pain is to be mindful of the pain being experienced. Here's an associated sutta section: 

It might be worth to mention that the first ascetics the Buddha considered teaching after attaining nibbāna were Alara and Uddakha, for they had "little dust in their eyes" [2]. 

The point of that practice is to create a strong understanding and conviction about all and any stimuli that we may come to contact through our senses: 

(*) The greatest pseudo-science though: the time dr. Vieira didn't spend trying to come up with scientific experiments to gather evidence was the time he spent documenting every little detail of the astral experiences. 

"Is there a conflict between dependent origination and right effort?" I'm not sure I understand...but I think one conflict is in the word "causes", and also with how to interpret (and make use of) dependent origination. For example, one could express the following idea: "because of his effort, Gotama reached nibbāna". Does that mean that nibbāna was conditioned by his efforts? And yet, where is the "effort" link in dependent origination formulation? Also, in that case, would it be proper to conclude that nibbāna is conditioned? When dependent origination is taught in the suttas, often what seems to be stressed are, literally, conditions, not causes as we often understand them (eg. agents that actively produce or directly contribute to a result). 

It seems to me the above refers more broadly to the faculty of intelligence (which includes creativity) combined with skills, and not necessarily artistic expression or art appreciation. Naturally, these faculties are generally beneficial for any kind of endeavor, including the study, the practice, the teaching and propagation of Buddhism. 

In the case of monks engaging in these acts, there may be something specific in the Vinaya, the collection of monastic rules, about how to handle these situations. 

That is, by evaluating all experienced based on our sensory faculties, he established the pleasure that arise with them as condition (the gratification). And due to it's characteristics of being impermanent, he observed it carries a danger for suffering. That sums up the first noble truth: "this is dukkha". 

Zen is very hard. Specially without a great teacher. A popular idea is that Zen could "get away" from emphasis on study because it produced great teachers who did not "need" to refer to scriptures -- when they could simply refer their disciples to reality, using whatever means (including Buddha's words). This Zen attitude is believed to come from many things. One of them is it's origin in the flower sermon. Another is the culture it developed around accusing exclusive intellectual/abstract understanding of the dhamma -- carried out famously by the "finger and the moon" metaphor. Like a person who spends his/her life studying sex but no amount of study got him/her close to lose the virginity. But shikantaza has a flip side of the coin that is as devoid of value as studying Buddhism for Buddhism sake (if nibbāna is of concern). And that is, by "just sitting", it's quite possible one's life is spent "just sitting" and nothing really happens, ever. Like drawing lines and random symbols on a canvas and hoping to arrive at language and poetry. In my understanding, the critical point is: in a learning process of any kind, there must be an evaluation process (ad-hoc, implicit, explicit, formal,... whatever), done by yourself, your teacher, or both (when one has a teacher). And evaluation is always a function of one's goal and one's current distance to that goal. It's evaluation that tells where you ware, if you are moving, and towards what you ware moving. Otherwise, it's just random walking around and hoping to stumble on a goal that became a taboo(*) to acknowledge. (*) it seems every once in a while this idea becomes popular: that "enlightenment" is not something to strive for. What was once a pedagogical instruction towards specific people overly attached to a goal keeping them from progress, is now a full doctrine. On a final note: the major risk of not reading the Buddha's word is, years later, find out that what you were doing had little to do with what he proposed. 

These can be difficult and painful to practice. As one becomes more dedicated, the practice also becomes more difficult. One is taught to restraint faculties hard to restraint, to endure things hard to endure, to avoid things hard to avoid and to develop things hard to develop (MN 2). Just the following, from MN 2, can be quite painful to practice: 

"Views regarding one's past and future existence are included in the "62 false beliefs"" A little context: I assume the 62's mentioned above are the same as found in DN 1 (Brahmajāla Sutta) translated as "The sixty-two kinds of wrong views" by Walshe (MN 102 also develops on these wrong views). Now, "wrong view" is understood as either "not according to the damma" or simply "not in accordance with reality". In this sutta, we read the Buddha say: 

Claiming that citta is everlasting is not just a challenge to suññatā, but a challenge to anatta, and thus, a contradiction to pretty much the entire canon on that matter (whose summary has been written as sabbe dhamma anatta: all dhammas are not-self). Finally: 

...which continues in a chain leading to jhāna and, further on, liberation. In the context of meditation, jhāna is specifically said to be a superior pleasure compared to sensual pleasures (SN 36.19) and, for example, seclusion and samadhi are sources of pleasure (in the first and second jhānas). Also, the following are benefits associated with wholesome pleasure obtained when metta practice "has been pursued, developed, and cultivated, made a vehicle and basis, carried out, consolidated, and properly undertaken" (AN 8.1): 

Also, as a side note, the language used in the article, it's propositions are that of hypothesis. In other words, the author is speculating about it, conducting an inquiry (e.g. note the use of "possibly") and drawing parallels -- like any historian would do. So, he does not seem to be defending or promoting any position as a fact. And because he is just offering alternatives, he is not really leading or misleading. After all, as a matter of principle, when an author offers alternative possibilities (e.g. "it's possible that a person is guilty of certain crime"), he/she is not accounted for readers who decide to remove the provisory character of the statement without reflection and simply believe the possibility to be true (e.g. "the person is certainly guilty of certain crime"). In this way, readers can mislead themselves but the author is not responsible for it. 

In the sutta above, the four noble truths are also applied to each element in dependent origination as an alternative exposition of Right View. Another method of exposition is by their opposite. Here, the Brahmajāla Sutta is the most important sutta, which discusses 62 kinds of wrong views. Right View, as has been stated, is the foremost on the Noble Eightfold Path. Right Thinking (sammā sankappa) The PTS Pāli dictionary gives the following translation for sankappa:
