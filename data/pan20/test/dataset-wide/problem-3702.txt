The answer is infinity for $n>2$. Suppose that there is an $i$ such that $T^i(x)=0$ for all integer vectors $x$. Then the same follows for all rational vectors by homogenuity, and then for all real vectors by approximation. But there is a real vector that never reaches zero. For example, for $n=4$ consider $$ (a^3,a^2,a,1) $$ where $a>1$ satisfies $a^3=a^2+a+1$. The next iteration is $$ (a^3-1,a^3-a^2,a^2-a,a-1) = (a-1)\cdot (a^2+a+1, a^2, a, 1) = (a-1)\cdot (a^3, a^2, a, 1) . $$ Note that it is proportional to the original vector. By induction it follows that the $n$th iteration equals $(a-1)^n$ times the original vector, hence it never becomes zero. An obvious modification of this example works for every $n>2$. 

No. Define a Riemannian metric tensor $g$ on $\mathbb R^2=\{(x,y)\}$ by $$ g(x,y) = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & f^2(x) \end{pmatrix} $$ where $f:\mathbb R\to\mathbb R$ is a positive smooth even function such that $f(x) = \cos x$ for $|x|\le 1$ and $f''(x)/f(x)$ increases after $x=1$. Let $N$ be an open segment of length $\pi$ in the $y$-axis, e.g. the one between points $A=(0,0)$ and $B=(0,\pi)$. (The plane with this metric is isometric to the universal cover of a surface of revolution that looks like a unit sphere with two infinite tubes attached near a pair of opposite points. Note that the Gaussian curvature $K$ is given by $K=-f''/f$, so $K\le 1$ everywhere.) The strip $\{|x|\le 1\}$ is isometric to the universal cover of a neighbourhood of the equator of the standard sphere, so there are plenty of geodesics between $A$ and $B$. On the other hand, using Clairot integral and the fact that the Gaussian curvature does not exceed 1, it is easy to see that no geodesic can intersect the $y$-axis at two points with distance less than $\pi$ between them. Hence $N$ is totally convex but its closure is not. 

The answer to the title question is yes (well, I assume that by a "surface" you mean something reasonable, like a boundary of a convex set). Let $AB$ be the longest segment with endpoints on the surface. We may assume that its length equals 2 and its midpoint is the origin. Consider projections to the planes that contain $AB$. Since projections do not increase distances, $AB$ is a diameter of each projection. Hence all projections to this family of planes are unit discs centered at the origin. The intersection of the corresponding cylinders is the unit ball, hence the result. Added. In general, we cannot determine a convex body from the set of shadows (if we don't know the correspondence between shadows and directions of projections). Take a unit ball and cut off three identical tiny caps whose centers form a regular triangle on the sphere and are not on one great circle. Looking at shadows, you cannot tell whether all three or only two caps are removed, because each projection shows you no more than two of them. The same construction works for polyhedra if you start with an icosahedron rather than a ball. 

For any sensible definition of perimeter, an adaptation of following argument proves the claim. Consider the nearest-point projection map $p_A:\mathbb R^n\to A$ (that is, for every $x\in\mathbb R^n$, let $p_A(x)$ be the point of $A$ nearest to $x$). It is easy to see that $p_A$ is Lipschitz-1, i.e., $|p_A(x)-p_A(y)|\le |x-y|$ for all $x,y\in\mathbb R^n$. Such a map should decrease perimeters (or your definition of perimeter is flawed), hence $P(X)\ge P(A)$. With Caccioppoli definition (which I just learned from Wikipedia), you need to translate this argument to the respective language. The resulting proof is e.g. the following. We may assume that $\partial A$ is smooth. Then consider the following smooth unit vector field $\phi$ in $\mathbb R^n\setminus A$: $$ \phi(x) =\operatorname{grad}(\operatorname{dist}(\cdot,A))(x) . $$ It is easy to see that $\operatorname{div}\phi\ge 0$ on $\mathbb R^n\setminus A$. Extend $\phi$ to $A$ so that it remains smooth and $|\phi(x)|\le 1$ for all $x\in\mathbb R^n$. Then $$ P(X) \ge \int_X \operatorname{div}\phi = area(\partial A) + \int_{X\setminus A}\operatorname{div}\phi \ge area(\partial A) $$ where the first inequality follows from the definition of the perimeter, the equality from Green's formula, and the second inequality from the fact that $\operatorname{div}\phi\ge 0$ on $\mathbb R^n\setminus A$. 

Concerning the second question. A single closed geodesic is not enough. For example, let $S$ be the equator of the standard sphere. All distances between points of $S$ are realized by paths in $S$, so you don't have any information about the metric outside $S$, except that it is sufficiently large (so that the paths outside $S$ are not shorter). On the positive side, for every 2D Riemannian manifold, you can construct an embedded graph $S\subset M$ such that the distances between its points determine the metric uniquely (up to an isometry). It suffices to take a union of small geodesic circles such that their encircled regions cover $M$ and lie within convexity radii of their centers. Indeed, a metric on a 2-disc whose boundary is convex and whose geodesics are all strictly minimal, is uniquely determined by the distances between boundary points. This used to be a long-standing conjecture and was proved in 2005 by Pestov and Uhlmann: "Two dimensional compact simple Riemannian manifolds are boundary distance rigid", Ann. of Math. 161 (2005), no. 2, 1093--1110; MR2153407 (2006c:53038). In higher dimensions, the full conjecture is still open. Until very recently, it was known only for very special metrics (some locally symmetric ones and some splitting ones). Dima Burago and I proved it for sufficiently small regions in any Riemannian manifold, where "sufficiently small" actually means that the diameter is small relative to the maximum modulus of sectional curvature (and of course to the injectivity radius). This is in our paper "Boundary rigidity and filling volume minimality of metrics close to a flat one", Ann. of Math. 171 (2010), no. 2, 1183--1211. So, as Will Jagy suggested in his answer, you can take the $(n-1)$-skeleton of a sufficiently fine triangulation for $S$. I am not aware of any numerical algorithms for this problem. It is known that the solution is stable (depends continuously on the input data) but you have to take into account the derivatives of the boundary distance function. A $C^0$ approximation of the distances is not enough to find an approximation of the metric, see Paul Siegel's answer. 

If $M$ is not $S^2$ or $RP^2$, then $\pi_1(T^1M)$ does not have elements of finite order (in particular a double non-contractible loop is also non-contractible). Indeed, consider the long exact sequence of our fibration $E=T^1M\to M$: $$ \dots\to \pi_2(M)\to \pi_1(F)\to\pi_1(E)\to\pi_1(M)\to\dots $$ where $F$ is a fiber (a circle). Note that $\pi_2(M)=0$ (since the universal cover of $M$ is the plane), hence the arrow $\pi_1(F)\to\pi_1(E)$ is injective. Hence the kernel of the arrow $\pi_1(E)\to\pi_1(M)$ is isomorphic to $\pi_1(F)$ which is $\mathbb Z$. So this kernel does not contain elements of finite order. And if a non-kernel element has a finite order, then so does its image in $\pi_1(M)$. But $\pi_1(M)$ has no elements of finite order (e.g. due to existence of a nonpositively curved metric on $M$). 

Given three points $a,b,c$ in a (geodesic) metric space $X$, one defines a comparison angle $\angle(a,b,c)$ by the cosine law: $$ \angle(a,b,c) = \arccos \frac{|ab|^2 + |ac|^2 - |bc|^2}{2\cdot|ab|\cdot|ac|} $$ where $|ab|$, $|ac|$ and $|bc|$ are distances in $X$. In other words, $\angle(a,b,c)$ is the angle of a planar triangle with the same side lengths as the triangle $abc$ in $X$. Given two paths $\xi,\eta:[0,\varepsilon)\to X$ starting at the same point $p=\xi(0)=\eta(0)$, define a metric angle $\angle(\xi,\eta)$ by $$ \angle(\xi,\eta) = \lim_{t,t'\to 0} \angle(p,\xi(t),\eta(t')) $$ if the limit exists. If $X$ is a smooth manifold with a $C^2$ Riemannian metric (which defines a geodesic distance in the usual way) and $\xi,\eta$ are $C^1$ regular curves, then a curvature comparison argument shows that the metric angle is well-defined and equals the Riemannian angle between the velocity vectors $\dot\xi(0)$ and $\dot\eta(0)$. But what if the Riemannian metric is only $C^1$, or even $C^0$? More precisely: 

I have no idea about the general case but in the convex case the sphere is indeed optimal. Moreover the $L^1$ norm of $H$ attains its minimum at the sphere (among the convex surfaces with the same area). To deduce the result for the $L^2$ norm, just apply Cauchy-Schwarz, Let $A$ be the convex body bounded by $\Sigma$ and $B$ the unit ball in $\mathbb R^{n+1}$. Then the area $|\Sigma|$ is proportional to $V_1(B,A)$ and the integral of the mean curvature is proportional to $V_2(B,A)$, where $V_k(B,A)$ is the mixed volume of $k$ copies of $B$ and $n+1-k$ copies of $A$. By the Alexandrov-Fenchel inequality, $\log V_k(A,B)$ is a concave function of $k$ ($k\in\{0,1,\dots,n+1\}$). This fact yields a lower bound for $V_2(B,A)$ in terms of $V_1(B,A)=C(n)|\Sigma|$ and $V_{n+1}(B,A)=V(B)$, a constant. Namely $$ C(n)\int_\Sigma H = V_2(B,A) \ge V(B)^{1/n} V_1(B,A)^{(n-1)/n} = C_1(n)|\Sigma|^{(n-1)/n} $$ If $A$ is a ball, the inequality turns to equality because so does the Alexandrov-Fenchel inequality. 

Since the set of critical points is always closed, it suffices to assume that $\phi$ (or, more generally, its restriction to the set of its critical points) is proper. (A map is called {\it proper} if the pre-image of every compact set is compact.) One can formulate various sufficient conditions in terms of $M$. For example 

With interior: yes. Fix a sequence of squares $Q_1\subset Q_2\subset\dots$ whose union is the entire plane. Then arrange a map $g:\mathbb R\to\mathbb R^2$ such that, for every nontrivial segment $[a,b]\subset\mathbb R$, its image is one of the squares $Q_i$. To do that, construct countably many disjoint Cantor sets so that every nontrivial interval contains at least one of them. Then send every Cantor set $K$ bijectively onto $Q_n$ where $n$ is the minimum number such that $K\cap [-n,n]\ne\emptyset$. Send the complements of these Cantor sets to a fixed point inside $Q_1$. Then define $f(x,y)=g(y)$. (This is a detailed version of gowers' answer.) UPDATE Without interior: no. Take any triangle $T$ and consider its image $Q$ with vertices $ABCD$. There is a side $I$ of $T$ whose image has infinitely many points on (at least) two sides of $Q$. If these are opposite sides, say $AB$ and $CD$, the image of any triangle containing $I$ must stay within the strip bounded by the lines $AB$ and $CD$. And if these are two adjacent sides of $Q$, say $AB$ and $AD$, the image of any triangle containing $I$ stays within the quarter of the plane bounded by the rays $AB$ and $AD$. In both cases, the images of the triangles containing $I$ do not cover the plane, hence the map is not onto. 

No, it is not even path-connected in general, already for $n=1$. Consider the folding map $f:[0,1]\to[0,1]$, namely $f(t)=2t$ for $t\le 1/2$ and $f(t)=2(1-t)$ for $t\ge 1/2$. There is no path connecting the orbits of the two fixed points: 0 and 2/3. Indeed, suppose there is a continuous path $t\mapsto \{x_n(t):n\in\mathbb Z\}$ in $S_f$ such that $x_n(0)=0$ and $x_n(1)=2/3$ for all $n\in\mathbb Z$. Consider $x_0(t)$ and $x_{-n}(t)$ where $n>0$. While $x_{-n}(t)$ travels from 0 to 1/2, $x_0(t)$ will take the value 0 at $t_0=0$, then the value 1 at some $t_1>t_0$, then 0 at some $t_2>t_1$, then 1 again, and so on, $2^n$ times. Since $t\mapsto x_0(t)$ is a continuous function, it can have only finite number of alternating 0 and 1 values, but $n$ can be arbitrarily large, a contradiction.
