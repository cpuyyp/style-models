The simple fact is that most interviewers won't provide feedback. There are two major reasons, and the first is time. When I interview, for example, I usually end up looking at somewhere between ten and thirty resumes, and spending around six or eight hours minimum on direct interviewing - per position. What I don't have is any extra time in the day. So, spending half an hour or more writing up feedback for each unsuccessful candidate is hard to find time for, even if I want to. The second factor is that, while you want to improve, there are a whole bunch of folks out there who suck. Folks who respond to feedback with some variant of "** you, you *ing ***", or who use it to argue about how you unfairly missed their skills, or any number of other terrible ways to handle that feedback. That doesn't encourage people to respond - even to folks like you who really, genuinely do want to improve, and who will take it well. Actually, there is also a third possible cause: I often don't know about the hire/pass decision because I just file feedback in the system, and the decision is made by the hiring manager elsewhere. 

The common theme always seems to be don't worry about the other guys pay or to just get over it but for me personally I can't get over something like that if I know the guy is no where near up-to my level. It tends to eat at me until I just don't enjoy the work environment any more. So my tactic was to negotiate other things that would make the job more enjoyable without it effecting the company and my production. This has meant that my issues with the pay has lessened (although I still get irate and feel exactly as you do over pay in-equalities) and I know don't think about it all the time. As for how I handled that negotiation. Of course it varies, but for me I used these tactics: 

I find I have quite a bad memory so when I ask a team member if they could do something and let me know when it's done I tend to forget about it and rely on that person to remember and hence let me know when it's done. However I find myself constantly having to chase people up when I realized they haven't done it. It's not just on the odd occasion but I find it happens the majority of the time to the point where I don't feel like I can trust the members in our team to remember to do something that we talked about. Not only that, I find it effects my time as I feel like I have to remember not only my tasks but others as well. I understand everyone is busy with their work and so don't expect people to jump when said jump p.s. I'm not a manager as we work in a agile environment and so try to facilitate a flat level hierarchy where we can! What I would like to do is become better at helping facilitate better communication between team members and expressing the desire that when we discuss an issue and agree to doing something the person takes ownership of that request. 

As someone who interviews, honesty never hurts, and if you really have never been in that situation just say so. (Though, honestly, I would be surprised if you had missed either of those over the course of your life.) The purpose of the two questions is reasonably simple: For the first, I would want to understand how you approach the problem of needing to get consensus about the solution to a problem, and how you motivate other people to solve it. If you really don't have anything that comes close to that at work, go back to a group project you were involved in in college and talk about that instead. It isn't as good as real work - and you should tell me why - but it is a way to answer the underlying question. For the second, I would want to understand how you handle disagreement, and especially strong disagreement, in the workplace. Look for something where you and a colleague didn't agree about the best way to solve a problem. It doesn't have to be fancy, or super important, or angry or anything. Talk about how you approach the disagreement: how do you find common ground, how do you handle someone who is passionate (but wrong) about their approach, how do you compromise? Again, if you really don't have an experience like that in work, go back to college, or that time you volunteered to coach the softball team and someone told you how to do it better, or whatever. The goal is to try and understand how you will approach those situations if you work for this company. Think about how, if you asked someone that, they could make their actions clear to you. (As an aside, talking about - and asking about - concrete incidents, not just hypotheticals is a sign of a good interview, because what you did rather than what you think you would do is a better indicator of the next time around.) 

Communicate more with your boss in advance (assumes that regular status is a job responsibility) Set your boundaries (assumes these calls are outside your work requirements) 

What I find really interesting about this question is that it seems that everyone is ready to accept you as the expert except for you. I think that's where your discomfort with handling this situation comes from. If you felt very comfortable in being the expert on something, I don't think you'd really be asking this question - we are all experts on something and most of us have no problem being acknowledged as such. And I think feeling unsure about this is totally reasonable, there are a number of situations where we may be uncomfortable with being introduced as an expert, but from reading your question the reason seems to be your own confidence, not others confidence. i.e.: 

These are both reasonable answers, but I think a more general answer may help. While it's important to realize that you do have some sort of a personal relationship with your boss that needs to be maintained, it's also important to realize that this relationship is based on a contractual relationship first and foremost. So the question to ask first is, what is your contractual obligation in order to do your job? If you are giving your boss the status reports that are required, and you are not expected to be reachable outside of work, then you have no obligation to answer the phone. From a personal relationship perspective, you're probably best off either: 

Generally I think referring or recommending someone for a position is a risky business. Essentially you are putting your reputation on the line in that how they perform may reflect on you. I would suggest never recommending or backing someone unless you were confident in their abilities and had a complete grasp of their work ethic. If you believe you have this then by all means put in a word in the right ear. I think in this day and age I would consider recommendations from existing employees (especially if I value their contributions) go a long way to selecting a condidate for a position. I think you have done well to say send in your CV, but perhaps make it clear that you are not reponsible for the actual hiring process etc Perhaps say the HR have some fairly strict processes everyone needs to follow but you could have a talk with the brother and give him some pointers. It might also give you a chance to sound him out! If he is a slacker and you have referred him then yes, I would imagine it will reflect badly on you in some context. FYI. I once recommended and got a good friend a position. I knew he was a hard worker and he ended up being an excellent worker. He in turn got another friend a job but that guy ended up being a bit of a slacker. He said to me that he regretted recommending him as he felt it reflected badly on him and other co-workers talked about him all the time how bad he was. It put him in an awkward situation both in the workplace and in the social scene with this friend. Although your situation is a brother of a friend it too might put your friendship in a potentially strained situation if things don't turn out. Just be prepared for that and try and maintain a work / friendship seperation if you can with your friend. 

I can tell you from experience that if you approach discussion from this assumption, that people will often follow your lead and discard your input. Why should they believe your input if you have trouble believing you are the expert? My guess is that you actually are the expert as they say, especially considering that they are ready to claim that even though you are not. You are probably quite talented in whatever this discussion is about, and you also are probably not fully willing to hold that confidence in yourself or to recognize that you deserve it, even though others do. There is a place of confidence that is not merely cocky or arrogant. I see that this can be a place of discomfort for you, but is probably worth investigating. You are good at something (probably many things, as all of us are), but you are the last to accept it. That makes it really easy to shut down in meetings when many people are talking. To feel like you don't have the charisma to lead the way or to get people to follow your answers. I sympathize with what you are going through. But your colleagues can see that you are the expert. From how you've worded your question, I can see that you are the expert. Perhaps you should be less concerned with how you "answer" that introduction (as if it needs some correct answer) and more concerned with what is happening inside yourself to even raise the question in the first place. Good luck! 

I don't think programmers need peace and quiet any more than anyone else. I believe that like people need like environments not matter what their area. It just so happens that programmers tend to need to concentrate on tasks and so quiet helps best facilitate that. Sales people might need to talk and receive immediate feedback so this tends to lead to a more vibrant environment. In saying that though. A development team in an agile environment might have a number of different professionals all in the same room and so interaction between the various parties would be constant and encouraged. Pair programming could also add to noise etc In your case, I think it sounds like two different environment requirements trying to share the one environment. An exam situation has totally different requirements to trying to get work done when interaction is a must. 

Of course it's acceptable to decline, but be prepared to accept the consequences of your actions that this may occur. Such as 

It's unclear to me why so many people are afraid of negotiation and for asking for what they want/deserve. Quote a price. Either it will be worth it to them or not. You don't need to be polite about not accepting an offer, that doesn't necessarily make you rude. You don't even need to necessarily reference it. Don't let them set the standards or the options for the value of your work. I would say something like: "My price for that work would be $xxx. Let me know if that works for you!" Consider this. If you went to a car dealership and offered a car dealer a few cases of wine for a car, the dealer doesn't have to apologize for not accepting it, they will probably just tell you their price for the car. 

Setting up your phone so it doesn't ring when your boss calls you off-hours (there are apps for this) Politely asking if your boss is calling just to check up or if he's worried about your work - and if it's just to check up, see if he can checkin with you at work instead, because it will be difficult to know if he's ever calling because of a work emergency if he regularly calls.
