If one takes a materialist view of this teleportation process, then consciousness of an individual is merely (merely!) the product of the structure of their body and all its constituent parts. Creating an exact or a perfect copy of the individual when create someone with the same consciousness of the disintegrated individual. Structure has been destroyed in one place and reconstituted at another. Distance will have little to do with it except for the practical aspects in transmitting the information from one place to another. While science isn't exclusively materialist in its worldview, it does tend to exclude entities which it has no evidence for their physical existence. In this sense consciousness lacks any physical properties. It is better thought of as the emergent properties of organisms with complex neurological systems. Therefore, if you can reconstitute an individual that is an organism with a complex neurological system it will have the same emergent properties as its original, and should have the same consciousness. Of course, if the process of creating perfect copies could be carried out without disintegrating the original individual, then this would multiply the number of individuals with the same consciousness. If any differences in their consciousness existed, they are quite likely to be indistinguishable. The alternative conceptualization is the Cartesian model where consciousness is intangible something that exists outside the body. presumably, this extrinsic consciousness could readily reunite itself with the reconstituted individual. Unless, of course, the disintegration process permanently severed any connection with the structure that was the individual. However, there is no scientific basis for the existence of spirit-like consciousness, this is wholly a philosophical construct due to Rene Descartes, and this place its consideration outside the ambit of this question. In summary, if consciousness is an emergent property of complex organisms then their disintegration and reconstitution should recreate individuals with the same consciousness of their disintegrated original. Consideration of the mind-body problem is without a scientific basis and therefore outside the scope of this question (an this answer too). 

Building the boat would have required a substantial amount of time. Some creationist types have put construction time at between 70 and 120 years. Recall that Noah and co. were supposed to have lived for several hundred years. There are massive logistical problems with building the biggest wooden vessel ever constructed in ancient Iraq, not the least of which is supplies. The sheer amount of wood required to build the vessel is enormous - it would have had to have been imported to the area from elsewhere. Most of the vertebrate species on Earth are quite small. For instance, the vast majority of the 6000 amphibian species would, if placed in containers roughly the size and shape of 10 gallon aquariums, fill a volume of about 120'x15'x8' (40 3' wide shelves that are 15' wide and 8' high, crammed full of aquariums with just enough space between shelves to walk. If you could just throw all the frogs in a bucket together, then you can collapse this down substantially, of course. All but a few of the amphibians would fit into such a container easily.The other groups of vertebrates are similar, with most members fitting comfortably in a breadbox sized volume, but there are as many as a thousand species that need considerably more room. It's also difficult to count how many species there really are. For instance, the number of extant Equus species (horses and friends) is anywhere from 7 to 24, depending on how you count them. Monitor lizards dragons, the big cats, anacondas, pachyderms, and large primates are all problematic in this regard, and there's no good way to count them up by volume. If we give each of them a goat-sized stall (5'x8') and assume that the ones that are a little smaller will average out with the ones that are a little bigger, then considering all of the larger animals on the planet, you're looking at something like 40,000 square feet of floor space. With enough room to walk between stalls for feeding, the big animals would fill up about one and a third entire floors of the biblical ark. The non-fish vertebrates would have fit into the ark, barely.I initially thought that packing sufficient food for the trip would be problematic, but it is less so than I originally thought. The elephants would eat about 500 pounds of high quality food per day. The voyage was roughly a year long (a bit more if you add up all of the days) so that is roughly 70 tons of elephant food alone, another 70 cubic meters of space (assuming the food is packed extremely efficiently.) Food for a similar duration of the trip for all of the other animals would be problematic to collect, and for herbivores, the food will take up a substantial amount of space as well, though there is no reason you couldn't put that food in the enclosure with the animals. Gaining access to sufficient quantities of fresh water for all of the animals would be a challenge though. Now, could you cram all of the animals into smaller enclosures and have plenty of room? Of course you could, and if we're assuming divine intervention to deal with all of their behavior for the collection and trip, it might be appropriate to do so. In any case, the biblical dimensions, perhaps with some additional height added so that we can get three floors into it if needed, should be sufficient to hold the vertebrates and a year's worth of food. Using your rules, it would take a very, very long time and be exceedingly difficult. Any voyage would have been done by sea or caravan overland, and the logistics of moving that many animals to Iraq are daunting at best. Basically you'd have to build arks just to collect the animals to go on the ark. That is going to take years itself.The bigger problem is speciation. New species arise at a rate of roughly 1-3 per million per year. We'd expect as many as one new vertebrate species each decade. Columbus's trip took about a year, with essentially no overland travel involved. Magellan's crew got back after 3 years, again without significant overland travel. Lewis and Clark took 2 years to walk a single line across the continental US. Each new species that arose would set Noah back by years, and the time required simply to sail to every single required landmass on Earth would be astounding. I honestly don't know how to put a number to it. You also introduce the horrible logistics of caring for enormous numbers of animals while you wait for Ham to get back with the latest variety of leopard frog or whatnot.This amount of time is entirely dependent on the level of magic we're willing to accept. If the animals are not cooperative, then the collection will take forever due to speciation. If the animals are super cooperative, traveling to easy to reach ports for collection, then it might just be possible over the course of several decades or centuries. 

So as of now the earth's rotation is already slowing, at a rate of about 2ms a year, mostly due to the moon's tides so in about 5 Billion years the earth will stop rotating and eventually start spinning the other way! The only way for the earth to become tidally locked would be complete removal of the moon and some sort of catastrophic event (such as a meteor strike) that would remove the majority of %99.72 earth's angular momentum, an incident that would probably kill all life on earth. The only non-catastrophic event that could have this effect is a large body coming into orbit around the earth that would have the same effect as the moon only in greater proportion. [EDIT] This would cause massive waves flooding most of the continents but it MIGHT not kill everyone] 

This depends on availability of appendages, Helen Keller was able to communicate effectively enough to earn a bachelor's degree with no sound or sight (or pheromones that I know of.) She communicated with shapes and motions of her hands in contact with another person. If you creatures have some dexterous way to connect with another creature by changing shapes of that appendage they could communicate complex ideas. Ideas for how to add inflection: Vibration, Changing surface (extending spikes, slime etc), or even adjusting body temp. 

The solution to sending massive amounts of information, forget calling it data we're just too digitally obsessed to see the wood for the trees, into the 1950s was, of course, solved in the 1940s by the American engineer Vannevar Bush. He proposed etching information onto advanced versions of microfilm. This was called Memex. A place marker name for his hypothetical encyclopedia and library system of the future. However, this concept was later extended to using metallic wafers. The characters so inscribed were intended by to be read by an electron microscope. 

Ah yes! This brings back memories. It's our old friend the centrifugal submarine. Originally discovered while digging back through very early issues of New Scientist, probably first published in 1964 or 1965, and appeared in the magazine's humorous science column. Each week New Scientist published fabulous invention after fabulous invention devised by a wonderfully creative scientist under the pseudonym of Daedalus. Daedalus was named after the Daedalus of ancient Greek myth and legend, who was a epitome of the creative inventor-scientist. Despite minor setbacks like wings used by Icarus to fly. OK so wax melts, but that's only due to the lack of suitable fabrication materials. The man behind the Daedalus pseudonym was David EH Jones, a chemist, who consistently devised wacky contraption after wacky contraption for weekly publication. The contraptions were usually based on a seemingly plausible application of a physical, mechanical or chemical principle. Jones conceded there was often a flaw in the reasoning that made his contraptions impossible, impracticable or dangerous to use. 

My understanding of your rules: A. Transport two of every (non-fish) vertebrate to Iraq. B. Put them on a boat that would fit them all. C. Do this using only historically reasonable technology, with no additional divine intervention. Rule C is important, because once we allow magic, what's the point in asking the question? Any omnipotent deity who really cared could have poofed the boat and animals into existence instantly and skipped the entire silly story. I will, however, assume that the animals are willing participants in this process though - that once Noah reaches their range, he won't have to find and trap them. If not, I'm fairly certain that the process couldn't be completed by Noah and his family ever. 

Penguins (or similar, but penguins make the most sense) need to be born with adult feathers and/or blubber layers so that the chicks can survive in the water. Even tropical ocean temperatures are dangerous to warm blooded animals who are exposed and unprotected for long periods of time. As an alternative, the penguins' core body temperature could drop by 20°C or so and the bird could be restricted to the tropics, but that seems a bit much. The whale route is a possibility here as well, with both babies and adults losing their feathers entirely, but penguins rely heavily on their feathers creating an insulating layer between the water and their skin. The bird must evolve live birth. Shelled eggs have undergone massive amounts of evolution to function on dry land; getting a shelled egg to work underwater again would not be trivial. All sea dwelling members of formerly land-based vertebrates either give birth to live young (cetaceans, manatees, and some sea snakes) or are forced to return to land to lay eggs/have babies unsuited for ocean life (sea turtles, crocodilians, the rest of the sea snakes, flighted sea birds, penguins, and pinnipeds.) It's a lot easier to have the egg hatch out internally (or more realistically, fail to form/lay normally and continue developing without a shell internally.) For deeper diving penguins (not at all a necessity for permanent life in the water, just ask the boto) you would need greater lung capacity and perhaps larger overall size, though king penguins can already get down to 300m or so, which is comparable to dolphins. The animal's blood would also have to be vastly enriched in its oxygen carrying capacity. True deep divers like sperm whales have adaptations to prevent the bends as well as lungs that absolutely do collapse under pressure. Trying to design a biological pressure vessel that wouldn't collapse is probably a bad plan. Underwater communication - Penguins may already do this. Early tests of little penguins at the Perth Zoo were not positive, but the zoo is not a natural environment. Further, it is not at all unreasonable for penguins to evolve underwater communication. They're extremely vocal above water. Dolphin/whale blowholes are for breathing, not for vocalization. They vocalize using "lips" that are located internally, near their blowholes, but they don't blow out air when they vocalize, so you could put the nostrils/air inlet wherever you like. As far as the nostrils moving up the head for breathing purposes, that's not that big a stretch, though behind-the-head whale nostrils are pretty impressive. Regarding prey: There is something to eat at most any reasonable depth you might want your bird to inhabit. It would require a change of diet, but an unexploited food source is an enormous evolutionary driver. 

To change the ammout of time in a planets year one must adjust the height of the orbit via keplers law. If you want that planet to remain in the green zone of a star you would have to increce the heat output of the star. Changing the heat/size would change the colour of the star which would change the evolution of flora and fauna to maximise use of this diffrent light. 

In Short: Not Significantly. In Long: As covered by several of the other respondents humans evolved to not need such natural weapons. Setting that aside hypothetically if we did have some sort of natural weapon AS WELL as our other evolutionary advantages (Tool Use, endurance, etc.) one could reason that we simply would not use tools to do what we are naturally equipped to use. For example if we evolved with canine like claws we could conjecture that the 'discovery' of the knife would be delayed until a knife was 'discovered' that preformed the duty of the claw better than the claw. As well, we probably would develop tools to counter claws earlier due to human vs. human conflicts. 

Special Relativity states that the relativistic mass of a object changes depending on your speed. If you were to measure the relativistic mass of an object on your ship you could calculate your velocity. 

Using ammonia as a solvent would work, though if you want it to be pure ammonia, you'll have to keep your aliens quite cold, as it boils at -33°C. Aqueous ammonia solutions would work, but that does not seem to be what you're after. Ammonia isn't as broadly useful a solvent as water, but it does allow for lots of interesting chemistry to occur, including things like relatively stable solutions of solvated electrons, which are quite unstable in aqueous systems. Lots of biological reactions will produce water, so an anhydrous alien will need a way to excrete the water just as we have a way to excrete ammonia. Maybe your alien could excrete crystals of glycerol or urinate an alcohol or something like that. In any case, ammonia is a much better choice than a hydrocarbon. Breathing hydrogen is a bit more problematic. The purpose of breathing oxygen is that we can break C-H bonds and combine oxygen with both carbon and hydrogen atoms to release energy in the metabolism of organic molecules. Oxygen is highly reactive stuff; we just don't realize it because we've evolved to walk around at the bottom of an ocean of it. If we breathed hydrogen instead, it would be far less reactive. Hydrogen will readily react with lots of things, but it typically doesn't release huge amounts of energy in the process. One idea might be to have your aliens run a biological version of the Sabatier process. The reaction is spontaneous at low temperatures, though it would never actually occur without catalysis at liquid ammonia temperatures. This would give them a means of producing some basic metabolic building blocks from materials that are common in the universe as well as provide a reason for them to breathe hydrogen in the first place.
