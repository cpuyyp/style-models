You could threaten to leave and indicate that you have had a couple of offers. Of course that fact that you didn't actually accept the offers (for whatever reasons), makes this a weaker excuse that you'd prefer. You could be fired, although that would be unlikely. Are you willing to walk out if you continue to be paid less than you feel is fair? If so, then you have some leverage. But if not, then there isn't much leverage in your favor. Just because it takes a higher offer to lure new graduates to your company - that doesn't automatically mean you are worth more to the company. Remember, the company already knows how much you are being paid. And the company already knows how much they are offering others. So showing HR a bunch of facts and figures probably isn't going to sway their opinion. Your displeasure might sway them. More importantly, demonstrating your worth to the company (without regard to how much others are paid) might hold more sway. It probably won't get you fired, and might be worth a try. 

You always need to be prepared to answer questions that will logically follow when you state something. Here, rather than just being taken aback, you could have replied with answers indicating why you don't expect to be quickly bored in this particular new job. "I'm sorry if I misled you. I certainly don't expect every day to be exciting. I'm looking for a place where I can grow over time. That's the kind of place which will challenge me - and based on the research I've done, I believe your company has exactly that!" 

Since there is only one company involved here, the approach can be very simple. Start a petition, indicating what the problem is, and how it bothers people. Get as many signatures as you can, and hand it over to building management. If they see that many, many people are bothered, they will take it seriously, and find a way to solve the problem (as you indicate, there are many potential ways to keep geese away - many of which are not very expensive). At one office park where I worked, we had a similar geese problem. It was a multi-company office park, but a multi-company petition started things in motion, and the problem eventually got solved (it took about a year from the start of the petition until the solution was implemented). Good luck! 

In my experience, in my part of the world, it's pretty common when there is a question about an employee not being where they claim to be for employers to use whatever tools they have at their disposal. Some have security cameras. In some environments, badge-readers are used in a similar style. In some environments computer logs are used as well. In my shop, an employee who claimed to be coming in early and staying late every day was found to have lied when the badge-reader logs were checked. (It was already clear to everyone that she wasn't around as claimed, but the logs provided proof.) 

Yes, the response "I only lived here for school" may send the message to your local colleagues that "otherwise, I hate the place where you have chosen to settle down". This is probably not the message you intended to send. Something more along the lines of "I really liked it here, but we just think [the major city] is overall a better place for us personally in the long run." basically says the same thing, but perhaps in a kinder way. And you could always add "The thing I'll miss most is working with all of you." if it's the truth. 

You should be talking with your boss on a regular basis. And among the topics should be your job satisfaction and career development. Avoid generalities, like "I've been stressed", or "I'm not satisfied", or "I want career development". Instead, try to think about what is behind each of these. Your boss may not even know how you are feeling, or may not know the extent of those feelings. You may be wrong in your assumption that he can read between the lines. We bosses often have to deal with many issues and many people. Sometimes what is obvious to you (because you are closest to it, and feeling it personally), may not be obvious to others. You boss may not be able to change your situation, but if you don't speak up, he/she almost certainly cannot help. 

It's perfectly appropriate, since it was the owner who ultimately granted your promotion. A simple "Thank you for the promotion - I love working here and I really appreciate it!" would be both appropriate and welcome, I suspect. 

Meaningful to whom? Clearly it isn't meaningful to you, but is meaningful to whoever in your company requested it. In my company, we have a "dress code" for most days. In certain periods, the dress code is relaxed. For example, we are currently in a "Casual December". Those of us who have donated money to charity get to wear jeans and sneakers for the month. But the understanding is that if an important client, or someone important from the home office arrives, we must go back to our normal business casual dress. Talking to the Sales folks here, they believe it is very important to convey a certain impression to clients and prospective clients. Since more than anything, I want them to bring in a lot of sales so that we can all make a lot of money, I happily go along with it. I help them out in this way, and any other way I can, when revenue is involved. The part that I don't care for is the dress code for all the non-client-visit days in the year. I see no value in dressing up during the times when clients don't visit. I expect employees to act professionally, and would prefer that we trust them in their dress. But it's not my company, and I don't make the rules. If it were a huge deal for me, I suppose I would leave. But it's not that important to me, so I just go along with it. 

It only happened this morning. And you indicate that everyone already knows. It's not so weird that your boss hasn't made some sort of announcement yet. It's likely that he has lots of things to do (locks changed, etc) including determining if the machinist has actually quit via text (very odd thing to do), was just venting or would accept an offer to stick around for a while. 

Repeat this action hourly (or whenever he comes in for his next chat). When you are no longer in the zone and have free time where you actually want to chat, wander over to his space and chat. If you don't want to chat during work hours, then don't. In short, make him chat on your terms, not his. And stop enabling. Eventually, he'll turn his attentions elsewhere or else it won't be a problem for you. 

Maybe. It depends on many factors - your locale, the person's actual medical condition, if there actually is a performance issue, etc. Again, you seem unclear. Consult HR for advice and guidance. You post says nothing about poor performance - only that you feel wronged by someone who has unlimited sick days, calling in sick but doing non-sick things after hours and weekends. Try to get clear regarding what is the real problem here before acting on it. [Edit] Sounds like the problem you should concentrate on is the poor performance, and not the other factors that may or may not contribute. 

Report it to Security, Building Management and HR of the location where you have been working. Don't expect much - there's very little they can do. They might have security video that could be reviewed, and if it shows the identity of the person who peeled off your sticker, you could choose to go to the police. Unfortunately, the fact that you don't really know when or where it occurred makes it very unlikely for you to get any justice. 

I recommend not worrying about this until you know it's actually a problem. Most likely Andy didn't hear exactly what you worry that he/she heard. Most likely the call didn't end on exactly that syllable. Even if he/she did, it may not have been interpreted the way you fear. Worst case, if Andy did hear and interpret the phrase the way that concerns you, you can enlist the Office Manger's help (or even Andy's manager's help) in conveying the entirety of the sentence, and in apologizing if necessary. Don't be terrified. Accidents happen. Most likely, you are over-thinking this issue. 

If a company has been looking to fill an ordinary, non-unique position for a year, and hasn't yet hired anyone, it's because they don't really want to. Escalating this to someone of higher authority will likely not be telling them anything they don't already know. In decent sized companies, HR continually updates management on the state of hiring - new hires, open requisitions, how long open reqs have stayed open, what channels they are using to fill open reqs, etc. The only thing you would accomplish by escalating would be to make an enemy of those you "skip over". That's not something I'd recommend. Some companies, and some departments, delay hiring as a way to make their numbers look better. And often better numbers translate into better bonuses (for the managers who are measured by those numbers at least). I've worked at companies where it was rather routine to get rid of all contractors when fiscal year-end approached, whenever it looked like the bonus numbers were in jeopardy. You may need to just accept that your team will have fewer members, and a higher workload, than you would prefer - probably indefinitely. If that isn't palatable, you may need to look elsewhere. 

This is an easy one - just ask your boss what kind of evidence he wants and will accept. Then ask your health professional ahead of time to be prepared to provide that evidence. There are no "standards" here. What is acceptable for one boss or company will not be acceptable for another. So you must find out what works in your particular situation. And as @HorusKol correctly points out, you may need to consider local employment laws. 

Certainly I can imagine such a thing. You can write a contract for virtually anything. Often libraries/subsystems are sold that way. The customer purchases the system, but the vendor retains the source code. The customer may purchase a maintenance contract as well. But usually that arrangement is made when the vendor sells the library to more than one customer. Here, it appears that you are developing code solely for a single customer's use, and you aren't free to sell it to others. In my experience, what you are proposing would be very unusual. You will likely need a lawyer to help you draw up a contract, and perhaps to negotiate it with the customer as well. You need to be very careful about the rights to the software and the specifics of your responsibilities regarding satisfying the specs, testing, bug fixes, and support. If you aren't extremely experienced in this particular contractual arrangement, don't try to go on your own without legal advice. 

He asked if you would be interested, not if you would agree to unstated terms of employment. If you are actually interested, simple say something like "Yes, I'm definitely interested! I'd love to talk about an offer and see if we can get together on terms." Make sure you first have clear in your own mind what you want, as it will certainly be discussed. 

This is something typically handled by the staffing agency (at least in my part of the world). Talk with your boss at the agency. I'm sure they'll tell you how to satisfy the requirement from the contracted company. Most likely they handle this all the time. Where I work, our contractors send me a weekly timesheet for approval. It includes the hours worked each day, the contracted rate, and the total amount. The contractor provides the hours, but the staffing agency actually sends the invoice. 

Unless you are a C-Level executive, or at least a General Manager of your division, I don't think there's much you can do. 

When I interview candidates, I always ask "why did you leave?" If asked, the best explanation is always the truth. In this case, before 2/1, he could answer something along the lines of "the company is downsizing and I wanted to get a jump on finding my next job". After 2/1, a simple "I was laid off" is the truth, and is this the best way to explain the reason why he is leaving. Particularly in recent times, there is little stigma left regarding people who have been laid off. It happens (happened to me twice) and hiring managers understand this. Some will take advantage of this and respond with a lower offer, but many will not. Some hiring managers will assume that a laid-off candidate is desperate to get on a payroll, and thus will accept the lower offer. It sounds like this wasn't the case for your friend, as it sounds like he didn't accept the offer. But many won't respond with a lower offer (I don't when I see these circumstances). Either way, being dishonest isn't a good way to start a new job. And if he gets caught in a less-than-honest response, he runs the risk of being branded a liar (and could even be dismissed for lying in the interview).
