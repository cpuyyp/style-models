Yup, some companies are like that. (Valve takes this to an extreme.) And in any company, it's not the worker drones who do what they're told who are rewarded, but the self-driven people who figure out on their own what they should be doing to maximize their impact. As an intern who has not been assigned a project yet, you now have a golden opportunity to practice this in a low-risk environment! Talk to your manager and coworkers, find the niggling little things that they'd like to fix but can't because it's not on their priority stack, and fix them. It will be slow at first and you'll need to ask lots of questions, but people will generally be happy to help, because your work will help them. As you make yourself useful and show your skills, people will trust you and you'll get bigger things to work on. 

I would not bring it up during the "core" of the interview. However, if the interview went well and they get to the "so do you have any questions about the role?" part, it might be appropriate to bring it up, particularly if it's unclear if there is any remuneration. That said, especially in larger companies the person interviewing you well may have no idea about the compensation. All things being equal, I would advise that you wait until you have a solid offer on the table, and that if possible, you get offers from several companies so that you have a stronger negotiating position. Also remember that the primary value of an internship is not the money paid out during those few months, but the experience earned and the doors it opens to a well-paid future job. 

Does it mean anything? Ultimately it doesn't mean much. It sounds like a standard way of ending an interview. However! I do think you should always have some questions prepared to ask the interviewer. Do your research! This question is asked to gauge your potential interest in the company. It's always a good idea before an interview to research what you can about them. Typically I do this by looking at Glassdoor, Google and LinkedIn profiles of employees that I can find. As you do this you will inevitably discover some questions that you wish to ask and this is the time to do so. ... but if you can't Understandably that's not always realistic when the company is small or not much information can be found online. In these cases I defer to saying something along the lines of: 

In my last posting I was fortunate enough to work on a very exciting project that I had a non-disclosure in place for. Adhering to this disclosure I've never directly talked about the project except at a very high level and when required to. My previous employer has since gone out of business - is it acceptable to speak about this project with current colleagues or is it something I should continue to avoid? 

If you haven't even had a first interview, that would be too much information too early. Just go for the interviews, and if you get an offer or are asked about availability, set the date so that you can get your bonus first. I wouldn't disclose the reason why you need to wait until date X, unless they want you to join ASAP, in which case you could try to get them to give you a signing bonus to make up for losing the bonus. 

Unpopular opinion time: From both the company's point of view, and your managerial career's point of view, there is only one possible path forward: You have to report this to HR, even if your subordinate does not want you to. As a manager, your primary duty is to protect the company's interests. The company needs to know that one of their employees has raped (!) another employee, since this has "lawsuit" written all over it, and you will be negligent in your duties as a manager if you don't tell HR. What's more, if the company ever finds out that you were aware but did not report this, you will now be in hot water. Yes, I'm aware it's uncomfortable to go against your subordinate's explicit wishes, but while it's rational for her to be scared of him, it's probably in her own best interest as well that the company deals with the incident. Given the severity of the accusation, if there's any sort of evidence to back it up, odds are pretty high the harasser will be fired. Even if the investigation cannot conclude anything, in any half decent company she (and you) will be protected from any form of retaliation -- and if the company/accused is not decent and retaliates against her anyway, well, that's more fodder for a lawsuit. 

It's difficult to know exactly how to present this (as I don't know the full situation) but if it is as you say it is then he's likely going to hear this from multiple sources so state your piece, and don't talk him into a corner. You want him to know that you're frustrated but then give him opportunity to do something about the situation. Keep in mind that I wouldn't expect much in this situation. The company would have considered these positions before relocating the office and a lot of these fall under your personal responsibility. 

Let them know you're unhappy This situation came from a different climate for both businesses and as time has changed, so have your expectations. You sound like you've done very well in your role(s) and you would like to grow as an employee - you should talk to them and give them a chance to make things right. Let them know you're unhappy and try to present some changes that would benefit both parties. That doesn't mean you can't leave later anyway but you should give your employer some understanding of how you are feeling about the whole situation so they will have an opportunity to make it right. In future - talk with both businesses You asked if it's legal to work for two businesses at once and unfortunately there isn't a generic answer to this one, not even by locale. Whenever you're faced with this situation you need to chat to both companies to work out how they want to structure this. Ideally, from a tax and benefits perspective you would be best suited (in most countries) by receiving your pay by one business and having one reporting line. 

"...but there were other applicants who actually knew how to code, and in the languages that we asked for." For context, I've been the person reviewing those pre-interview code samples, although we didn't ask for 8 hours of work! While we also said "use whatever technologies you feel comfortable with", the job position also clearly stated the languages you would be working on, and it's not a good idea to pick one that's not listed there. Also, you win major points with the reviewer for returning a clean and elegant solution to the problem. If you went well over the recommended eight hours, I have a sneaky suspicion you ended up writing way too much code. When I'm expecting 100 lines of code to review, and somebody submits 1000, that goes straight into the "Nope" bin. As a final note, if the company is asking you to put in 8 hours of work (which is definitely on the high side), it's reasonable for you to ask if they will pay you a fee for your time. Quite a few companies will agree, and if they don't, it's a sign that you might not want to work there anyway. 

Don't buy into gossip. It sounds like these are both managers equal to or above you and it's not your responsibility to take action based upon a complaint. If somebody in the business is complaining to you then you should be referring them to the appropriate manager or human resources. If you can do something to resolve the complaint you should still do so but you shouldn't be the one bearing the responsibility for their personal conflict. Likewise if you hear gossip rumors about the two then don't engage the person telling you. You don't want to get involved in gossiping about these people, especially when it sounds like in some capacity you report to both of them. 

What would you like to make it? Ultimately this falls to you. Whatever position you list is selling you to a potential employer. There are a few things to keep in mind: 

Treat this just like any other application process I feel if you handle this professionally that bridges won't be burnt too badly. They'll be unlikely to create a new role for you again, but it shouldn't hurt you chances of applying to open opportunities they advertise for in the future. If the offer isn't to your expectations then I would be upfront and honest with them. This is just like any other job application process and if they are professional about this then I don't think they're expecting you to just settle for whatever terms they present to you. How to reply I would reach out to them with something like 

Politely, firmly, and in a face-saving way. "Hey Colleague, remember that shared thing we bought a while back? Did I give you my bank account details yet, so you could me wire your share? Cash also works if that's easier for you." 

If you want to be in the clear here, I would strongly recommend you check with your manager. Some general rules of thumb: Accepting cold hard cash is likely a no-no, it's essentially a refund of the company's money to you personally and that's a very slippery slope ethically if you don't tell them and for accounting, taxes, etc if you do tell them. Accepting miles, on the other hand, is likely fine. Most (but not all!) companies let employees keep theirs as a perk of business travel, and if you lost your company-paid biz seat this time, you can use them for a points-paid biz seat next time, so the karma balances out. They're also off the company balance sheet and don't cause the same kind of accounting headaches. The vouchers are somewhere between the two: much more fungible than points, but not quite cash either. Most bosses would not object to you taking them and using them for an upgrade the next time the company only pays for economy class, or (points-like) for leisure travel, but selling them on eBay would be pushing it though. 

Provided you reflect your position accurately and you can back it up with future employers then you can list this however you feel best represents you. 

Firstly, why shouldn't you have mentioned it? If the feedback was negative but fair then I wouldn't be too concerned. Assuming you had a one on one discussion with the CEO that was for the purpose of collecting feedback then I wouldn't expect that the CEO reflected the comments directly to your supervisor as being from anybody specific. He likely knows that somebody(s) in his team have made a complaint, but it's unlikely that he knows the who or specific details about it. I would carry on as per normal but expect that he's likely going to be looking to redeem himself, potentially at the expense of his team so keep all conduct as professional as possible. If however the case is that you were unprofessional in your complaint and you feel it's not something that should have been mentioned then I would defer to @Kilisi's advice and potentially consider retracting the comments with the CEO (depending on the seriousness of them). 

At the risk of sounding flippant... stop doing that? First and foremost, stop pulling 16-hour shifts, that's just ridiculous. If somebody's paying you to do this, they're not paying you enough to ruin your mental and physical health, so find a new job. If you're running your own business, hire help or cut back the hours, because you're burning the candle at both ends. Second, see above. Third, if you must and there's a good reason, make sure your ergonomics are good. Get a large external monitor and try out a standing desk. If for some reason you can't do either, at least prop up your laptop so it's closer to eye height and use a full-sized external keyboard. 

I would recommend the last of these. Your health is not worth sacrificing on the altar of managerial hubris and/or incompetence. 

The only thing that matters is what it says in your contract. If it says you're hired and you'll be paid X monthly, then the company has to pay you X monthly regardless of what the company's customers pay or don't pay. That said, if they company is so chaotic/short on cash that they can't make payroll, this is a very strong warning sign that they're in severe trouble and you should start looking for better options immediately. Also consult a lawyer if they do fail to pay you what they owe you.
