I often do investigate these opportunities. I start by asking why he links me to the company. Even if I am still convinced the person missed the point on my ambitions or the job content, I might try to get an interview, for instance to identify other opportunities in the company. The enthusiasm of the intermediary is a good excuse to go for an interview in spite of an incomplete match. Whether you went for an interview or not, always give feedback to the intermediary. Name what matched and what did not. It helps him or her to be more selective and motivates to stay alert. And last but not least, these leads might inspire to broaden your own search or even consider a career switch. But keep your own objectives in mind. Dare to say no after an interview and dare to explain a relative or friend he got it wrong, but do this politely and constructively. You can say "No", but say add the "thanks". 

I'd like to add a different point of view. Legally, the code you write is copyrighted. You are implicitly allowing them to use it for evaluation purposes, but if you don't explicitly allow them to use it on their website and they still do, you'll get more money out of that than they would have paid for the development. So don't worry, if it's for a publicly accessible website, they'd be stupid to “steal“ your code. And if they do, jokes on them, sue them for a license. 

As an alternative approach, you could suggest that another developer has a look at this. Two, three, or fifteen people saying it doesn't work and won't soon might convince management. Only works if there is someone else who isn't concerned with the project and therefore doesn't have to mask the truth. 

I actually organised my own exit interview, writing a mail to say that since I knew I would leave the company, I started thinking more critical about the company and was convinced this lead me to some insights that could help the company. This lead to a meeting in which I explained they had hired me for €500 more than I expected, but never offered me the opportunities I was looking for because I was too expensive to do this in a junior roll for some time. If they had paid me less and given me these opportunities, I would have had a great career with them. Finally I advised them to ask for the motivation of a senior candidate, even if they already know they want to hire him. 

Longer: In my experience some employers will notice and might ask for a reason, others won't. If they do ask, an explanation is worth a lot. They want to know if you were lazy or had a reason (caring for a relative, working to finance your studies, going abroad, a difficult university, extra classes ...). If you can convince the employer that you didn't spend your time in the sun or a bar instead of studying, you're fine. Shorter: Some will think you should have taken extra classes or whatever, others will think it proves that you are intelligent/motivated. In most cases it should not be perceived as negative. 

I'm currently working as a web developer in the DC area. About two months ago I interviewed with a well respected company (company A) after a good friend of mine referred me internally. After a rather vigorous interview process I was told that they really liked me and wanted to bring me on board, but unfortunately the government awarded the job I had interviewed for to another company. They said they would try to find other positions for me in the future but to obviously continue my job search elsewhere if I desired. A few weeks later my current company began a large series of layoffs so like anyone else I began interviewing at several other firms trying to avoid an employment gap. After a few weeks a very large and respected company (company B) reached out to me with an offer letter, stating that I had 5 days to either accept or decline. After thinking it over for a few days and waiting to see if anything else would come through I hesitantly accepted with a start date in three weeks, knowing that having this company on my resume would lead to many good opportunities in the future. Although I was disappointed with the salary they offered and technology they want me to work with (java) I felt that at the very least I had to avoid being unemployed. As luck would have it, less than a week later company A reached back out to me with a substantially better offer (over a third more money) in a position that directly aligns with my skills and chosen career path (front end dev with React.js). This offer has already been formally approved by the government so no problems there. As an added bonus company A will require a considerably shorter commute through the horrors of DC traffic. If I had not already accepted company B's offer I would be madly excited about this opportunity as my friend has had a great experience there for almost 5 years and the technologies their using are exactly where I want my career to go. Also, over 30k a year more with equal benefits is quite substantial. I know very similar questions have been asked previously, but I feel this is different enough in that I did not seek out other opportunities after accepting company B's offer, in fact I turned down many requests from IT recruiters and even contacted my friend to make sure he hadn't heard of anything coming through with company A. I'm aware that rescinding my acceptance with company B could certainly burn any bridges with them and possibly hurt my reputation as a whole. For the sake of professionalism and etiquette I'm inclined to keep my word and continue on with company B, however I feel I will quickly regret that decision and look to move on anyway after a relatively short time and it's clearly better to just move on now before they invest considerable recourses getting me up to speed. How bad is it ethically or professionally to move on? Any help is greatly appreciated! 

Always get as much "buy in" from the employer as possible before telling something that could scare him/her off. Never mention it in a first contact. Never tell it before the person at the other side of the table has really spent time on you. Once the interviewer discovered your added value, such as relevant skills not mentioned in the job requirements, once she/he is considering how to use these strong points, dropping you because of a disadvantage means invalidating all the effort done so far. That is the time to come forward with an issue like yours. Unless you decide to wait even longer, until your contract is signed. If you can hide the problem and be productive for some weeks, you might even wait until you proved your value once or twice, but then you must be quite sure you can mitigate the problem with not too much special measures. 

Write an e-mail to your co-worker and your boss explaining your situation and how you feel they don't take your concerns seriously. Do not put any accusations into that e-mail. If they don't respond with emails, make sure there are neutral witnesses to the conversation. Again, do not blame them. You'll have two possible outcomes. Either you dissolve a “misunderstanding“ and can hopefully go back to work with only a bitter flavor left or you have definitive proof that they are harassing your which you can then take to someone higher up. Or an attorney if that doesn't work. To help your case, try not to bring any accusations into the confrontation. Play naive and make every word and action based on the most positive understanding of anything they do. Assume they mean only well all the time until proven wrong with evidence that others can see. (In reasonable boundaries, while going to the party and leaving in an ambulance would help your case, I'm not suggesting actually trusting them, but everything short of risking your health) 

If there is something with your profile that needs to be taken into account before taking a position, that would scare off employers, I advice going through a trusted recruiter. Recruiters are engaged to by employers seeking for hard-to-find profiles. Their added value is to look further and deeper into candidates. It is a competitive advantage fort them to be unprejudiced and find candidates others would neglect. Due to my autism, I have problems discussing IT related issues with non technical people and I am reluctant to take the lead of a team. As a software engineer, after updating my linked-in profile, I was regularly contacted by the same recruiters. I consistently asked questions to know what communication would be required. Soon I selected two recruiters that used to give clear answers to these question and posed relevant questions in return. I acknowledged them for identifying interesting opportunities for me and proposed having a face to face discussion about my profile, in which I told them about my condition, the problems it had caused in the past and the way I use to mitigate them. They kept sending me interesting offers.
