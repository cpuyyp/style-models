Hinduism doesn't have 'God'; it does have Brahman, which is sometimes identified with it; since in this sense it is a monotheistic aspect of Hinduism, as for example exemplified in the Upanishads; but this doesn't mean the same thing. For example the Catholic doctrine of the Trinity as a description of God is not found in Hinduism. Nor is the Hindu concept of soul atma similar; in Advaita Vedanta (non-dualism), an Indian philosophical school, the atma is identical with Brahman; in Dvaita Vedanta distinguishes, at least partly between the two. Still, in a broad sense you are right; one can distinguish notions in most religions that correspond in some sense with the distinction that you make. 

Simone Weil, whose philosophy was in part inflected by Marxism would have gone for the latter; in Oppression and Liberty, she writes: 

We don't know what Socrates would have said about modern evolutionary theory because he makes no real mention of about any form of evolution; it's not outside the bounds of possibility that he had made remarks on evolution but they simply weren't recorded in the dialogues by Plato (which accounts for much of what we know about Socrates philosophy) since there is a short remark by Aristotle on the notion of random change and selection in evolutionary biology - which he dismisses because of the lack of a telos. 

The Ontology of the usual Set Theory has to be granted all at once - ie that there are sets and that there are elements - for what kind of Set Theory would we have if there were sets but no elements? It would mean that all sets would be empty; contra this, suppose we had only elements but no sets, then we can't form sets through the axiom of comprehension which gathers elements together into a set. This isn't the only Set Theory as a formal theory of Wholes and Parts; there is category theory whose ontology instead of sets and elements is instead sets and functions - except there they are called objects and morphisms; others are mereology and topology. 

First, the fine-tuning argument suggests that the tunable constants in the Standard Model have only got a narrow range of variation if a universe capable of bearing life is to emerge. So they can't quite be anything. Second, before we can find out whether a number is irrational we must measure it to infinite accuracy. In mathematics, this is a given. In physics, this is not so. A measurement with infinite precision needs to be carried out. Thus, given the limits on accuracy given by physical measuring instruments and the actual indeterminacy at the Planck scale it seems to me that to ask whether physical constants are rational or irrational is not a physically meaningful question. Still, it's an interesting question. 

And similar sentiments were expressed by Michael Holquist (professor of comparative literature, Yale) & Robert Shulman (professor of molecular biology, Yale) in correspondance with the New York times that was published: 

Kant gave good arguments for time with and without a beginning, and hence he deduces this question will be forever outside the possibility of answering it. We can only speculate and give good reasons for our speculation. Notwithstanding the big bang, one can still ask what happened prior to that. 

It matters how we concieve of something: the symbol '1' concieved purely as an integer cannot be divided; but as a real number, can be; it can be argued here that the same symbol is actually referring to different concepts - though we tend to tie them together, as there is a certain relationship between the concepts. 

When physicists or mathematicians talk about 'everything' they mean it in a sense peculiar to physics or mathematics and thus its ontology. Spinoza, for example. might have been somewhat nonplussed about the mathematicians universe, the universal set, that contained everything. Without waiting around for Russells Paradox to raise its head, he might have asked - does the universal set contain God? In his ontology everything is in God. The problem here is partly language and partly what we mean by a set. Physicists when they talk of everything it means something specifically targeted at their theory. For example when Newton talked about Universal gravitation it meant tying together Aristotles Celestial & Terrestial gravitation under one rubric. Similarly given the history of physics and the way that one sees how certain developments become subsumed in others, in particular electomagnetism integrating both the electric and magnetic force, it has led to the expectation, presently unfulfilled, that there will be a theory in which all forces are manifestations of a single force. One could call this a kind of physical monism. The GUT & TOE had specific & limited strategies in which they attempted this. One way to picture this, is that each force is associated with a symmetry group - like a circle or a sphere, and this specific strategy is to try to find some group that contains them. Unfortunately the results weren't particularly impressive. One could say that the name was a little premature. 

In Lacanian theory, the mirror stage first becomes effective when the infant ego is confronted with the possibility of another ego - an other - usually taken as the gaze of the mother; but this is but a moment in the life of the ego; Can this stage of mimicry & mirroring be traversed (in more minor modes) as an adult? That is the mirror stage happens not once, but again & again; with the first (traversal) being the most important, later ones less so (thus minor); to put it another way - does remain active as a permanent part/conditioning of the egos structure & formation - at times more active at other times less so - rather than a transient formation in the egos early life; if so, under what conditions does it heighten or intensify? Wikipedia suggests that it is: 

We're paradox free because of the differing registers of both rational & irrational thinking we're capable of. 

I assumed that extension in Spinoza, means the geometrisation of the phenomenal world; but possibly - probably this is wrong. After all, how does one geometrise something like matter? (There is, in this case, the speculative notion of Lord Kelvin, an atom as a vortex, a knot of pure geometry ie pure extension, and its mass indicated by how it knots). But, this on the face of it, seems merely a speculation of my own. Ungrounded in any texts. How then should one theorise extension? What did Spinoza mean by it? How have other philosophers used it? 

None of the books and papers I've seen in Category Theory mentions consciousness. One could say that one needs to be consciousness to do mathematics or to comprehend it; but this goes for any project. However, MacClane wrote in the Introduction to Categories for the Working Mathematician 

Proof is a central occupation of mathematics as it is constituted now through the axiomatic method; but there is the wider question as to why we are justified in taking proof as central; and also is this as central as it claims to be; judgement of course is required in deciding which questions are important. 

As direct experimentation at this level is simply out of the question; other means are used: agreement with existing theories; for example ST 'predicts': 

It was Brunos theology, rather than his cosmology had him burned at the stake for heresy. The Catholic church had no official position on the then new Copernican cosmology. During the late 16th century, and throughout the 17th century, Bruno's ideas were held up for ridicule, debate, or inspiration. Margaret Cavendish, the English aristocrat & philosopher for example, wrote an entire series of poems against "atoms" and "infinite worlds" in Poems and Fancies in 1664. But his cosmology was popularised later by de Fontanelle, in Entretiens sur la Pluralite des Mondes - on the Plurality of Worlds, at which point Cosmic Pluralism entered the mainstream of European thought. 

Which is already quite close to a good critique; I mean if someone came to you and said 'I saw some leprechauns in the garden' - you'd think perhaps they were starting on a shaggy dog story. You already know from experience there aren't any. I mean, it's not a logical truth - so your intuition and judgement was already on the right track ... 

This particular arrangement he appears to have taken from Alcmeaon of Croton Are these pairs of dualities, for want of a better name, related to his own list of categories? This relationship might be in the sense of replacement. On the face of it, it doesn't appear to be plausible, as they signify all the possible categories under which the subject or a predicate of a proposition might be considered. But, following the listing of the categories, he states four ways in which they can be considered to be contraries (according to Wikipedia) so there appears to be some suggestion here of a connection. 

Godels theorems are about the expressive power of formal languages; and only tangentially touches on the nature of truth; for mathematicians, it's importance is in prompting the growth of a new field: model theory. Though we don't have a world where 2+2=5; though if we did, we should ask what does it mean? Is it also the case that 2+2=4? So that 4=5? And what would this mean ... ? Though we do not have a world where 2+2=5; we do already have a world in 2+1=0 and 2+1=3 - this one - it's a world where we have the cyclic group of order three; and many others besides. The importance of non-Euclidean geometry is generally noted in contrast to that of the exemplary geometry - Euclidean geometry; and this by negating the parallel axiom. What is not noted, is the importance of non-arithmetic arithmetics - groups, rings, fields; they are as usefully important as the usual, exemplary one; to give it a name - Peano Arithemetic. Mathematical logic as opposed to logic has moved on; logic as Heidegger points out:
