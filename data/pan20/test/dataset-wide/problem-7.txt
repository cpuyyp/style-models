The immortal may become an "Adam" or "Genghis Khan" in the sense that he may sire a large portion of the population. Adam is recognised by the Abrahamic faiths as the father of all men. Genghis had 500-1000 direct offspring by most accounts. This immortal being, by fathering one child every ten years, will have by the time that the story takes place fathered as many children as Genghis Khan. Those children will have many children as well. Being spread out across the centuries, the immortal being will likely be an ancestor of almost all living beings. 

It is very likely that future civilizations will keep different time measurement scales for different events in spacetime. For religious ceremonies each religion would need to decide if the ceremonies are to be performed as per local time of the person, or as per the time of some specific location such as Earth. Note that we already have discrepancies here on Earth now, for example the Muslim year is shorter than the Gregorian year by I think 12 days. Thus, when a Muslim tells you that he is 65 years old, he may have been born only 63 years ago by the Christian way of counting years. The marking of anniversaries such as independence days, birthdays, remembrance ceremonies, and marriages would likely be done by the local time for the places or the people. Titan may celebrate 2 independence days for every 120 times that India celebrates its independence. However, an Indian on a spaceship to Alpha Centari and back may need to celebrate 15 Indian independence days during his 700 day voyage due to time dilation. During that time, his parents only celebrated their child's birthday twice for the 15 years they were waiting for his return. Legal privileges and responsibilities such as drinking age and driving age will need to be coordinated with the time dilation experienced by the person. Perhaps national ID cards will have a timekeeping device, similar to how radiation workers wear dosimeters today. Activities that must be performed on a schedule will need their time computed as per the location where that activity takes place. The seasons of a planet do not change just because the farmers travel to other star systems. The planning to return to some planet in order to tend to the crops in season there will have to be coordinated to happen once each time the planet revolves around its sun. I imagine that we will need computers to help us calculate when the events take place, and when we must leave our current destination in order to get to the proper location at the proper time, taking both distance and expected travel velocity into account. 

Your people have a fear of the cannibals over the next hill. You kill their tribesmen but once every few years one turns up in your village, anyone who dies could be their next meal. 

Planets are gods this one is a bit out there. Say that somehow all planets are sentient beings and can telepathically communicate with the populations living within their magnetosphere. You can describe away earth's monotheistic religions by explaining that was the planet directing humans but once they leave earth and discover more then each planet would be a diety, if to a small portion of the population. This would probably continue until we discover how they are sentient and spread across the universe, or the death star starts to blow them up. 

These lime stone caves become enormous, currently the deepest cave in the world is know as the Dark Star, measuring 17km at a depth of 900m. The whole thing is lime stone and not even completely explored. It is known as the underground Everest. 

One way this could develop from current events is from corporate-run "smart cities" such as Avasa in India. There are projects like this at least proposed all over the world, as the ultimate in privatised supply of public services. The idea is that private company funds, plans, and operates a high tech, fully integrated, city. All the tasks which might traditionally have been performed by local government are instead departments of this private company - transport, power and water supply, emergency and medical services, schools, etc. As a consequence, a large proportion of the residents are in fact employees of this one company - and it's not hard to imagine the city exporting goods or services from yet more fully-owned enterprises. In return, these corporations are able to set the rules of how all these services run - rules which would in any other city have been imposed on them by public bodies before they were awarded the contract. Now imagine that these cities are a success, and the rest of the country they're hosted in is in a long economic decline. The corporations will accrue ever more money, which they will want to invest in expansion, and the waiting lists for residence of the new cities will persuade the government to allow more cities to be built. Eventually, the corporations will start offering to "bail out" existing cities, converting a depressed slum into the latest branch of their franchise. As others have pointed out, the key power to take over is the police force, but it needn't be called that. Go into a shopping mall, and you will see uniformed guards, who have the power to evict you based not on the law, but on the rules decided by management. Scale that up to the size of a city, and you might find that a conservative Christian corporation manages to "outlaw" abortion, or homosexuality, simply by firing employees and evicting residents who don't follow its "contract". The surrounding state might allow this as a compromise of getting the investment, or it might simply lack the resources to compel the corporation to comply. I'm frightened and depressed how plausible this sounds, and now I have to go to sleep! 

In a normal lifetime these skills take awhile to develop. In a simulation with accelerated speed (2x speed? 10x speed?) people who want to learn these skills put in a fraction of the amount of time. This would be especially important for slow developing adults (some forms of autism need more time to learn soft skills) or business skills like managing. Services A number of services are time intensive, being able to manipulate time would be a very nice ability to have for things like Therapy. Therapy costs as much as it does right now due to high demand and limited time in the day. If we make a 10x simulation a therapist can spend 6 real minutes with someone for 60 minutes of therapy. Other services would be things like reading. Ever want to read that whole book in a single night so you don't have to for a class/course? a 10x simulation would take care of that in no time. 

Hitler opens Mein Kampf with a warning that exactly what he was going to do is what happens when the general population takes no interest in politics. He himself entered politics because he views that the more the general populace ignores politics, the more totalitarian the regime can be. If I may get up on a soapbox, I dare say that his rally to get the general populace interested in politics is the reason for the banning of Mein Kampf. There is actually very little antisemitism in that book. 

When the aliens were led out of bondage in Misr, their deity killed off all the first-born children of Misr. So how would a deity know which house had children to be spared, and which were to be killed? The aliens simply dabbed a bit of ruminant blood on their doorposts to inform the all-powerful that this house has children to be spared. To this day the aliens celebrate how their children were spared by placing not blood, but a parchment, on every door. Tradition dictates that they honour this parchment each time they pass through a doorway by placing it close to their heart. And since it would be such a pain to take down the parchment, hold it to the chest, and place it back again each time they go through a doorway, instead they simply touch the parchment with the sixth finger of their left hand, which conveniently has an artery coming directly from the heart. Since the aliens use their left hand to honor the parchment, they must always go through the door in a specific direction. The parchment must always be on their left. 

Many weapons made prior to the industrial revolution can be made out of organics. I will start at the bronze age and move forward as that is where metal really began to take hold in military use. 

It is socially rude to hold secrets from other people. Your mind linking society grows up learning the thoughts and feelings of others so in a public space they find it rude to have secret conversations with others. This would be similar to texting while out for dinner with friends. Telepathy makes others suspicious of your actions. In a police state no one wants you talking without being heard and even in a free democracy the government wants to keep tabs on it's civilians. As a protection to their personal freedom people speak out load so bugs and video cameras capture the events. The lack of speaking makes the person socially strange. Allowing unfettered emotional contact with any random person is the trade mark symbols of a sociopath who never questions his own thoughts. 

Note that on the surface of the planet the location of the north and south magnetic poles would not change, in fact a system with such high angular momentum would seem to be more stable than our current magnetic fields which do in fact wander. The field lines would be about the center of rotation of the two cores. If you want eccentric magnetic fields on the planet, then you might want to consider a more liquid core. This is completely plausible, and you could have phenomenon in which multiple poles appear for a few years or decades. I would suggest giving the planet a thicker atmosphere to protect the inhabitants, and don't give it a moon so that the planet's wobble will be more eccentric. 

Of all the solutions yet posted, I do not see any mention of expanding the habitable zone such that two planets with long, slightly-different orbital periods would both fit. This would require a very luminous star, I believe doubling the luminosity (average over wavelengths) would triple the distance to the inner and outer edges of the habitable zone. Our solar system has two planets (Uranus and Neptune) at 20 and 30 AU, which are in conjunction about once every 170 years. To expand the habitable zone from it's current 0.7 AU to 1.5 AU boundaries, we need a star about 8-10 times as luminous as the sun. Assuming that the star is the same colour as the Sun that would be a class IV subgiant, which would be too short-lived for life to evolve on, but could theoretically support human life that arrives there for millions of years. These are not uncommon stars, so it is completely plausible that humans find and colonize one if they are out colonizing anyway. If you need to allow for longer or shorter periods between when transfer between the planets will be possible, then you can adjust for star brightness and change the size of the habitable zone accordingly. In the interest of realism, make sure that your chosen brightness falls in an area on the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram with the same colour as the Sun (above or below it on the diagram) in a relatively dense part (i.e. no Sun-coloured 100 luminosity stars). 

We can use a see through material at the poles as a green house. Have a see through material like quartz cover the top of the water ice and over time the heat from the sun will gather under it, melting the ice down to the surface. This will make the environment warm. The surface should be an easily drain able material like sand. This way as the ice melts to reveal the ground the water drains down into the earth. This will provide the environment to be dry. The planet will need a 0 degree axis to sustain this and simulate a night/day at the poles. The rest of the planet, and even above the pole it can be a ball of ice making the planet much like you wish. As per one of your comments, this sort of environment will doubtfully create human like species. 

It had never actually occurred to me that deciding which family you are joining was a reason for gender-specific inheritance in the first place, and I'm not sure it's historically and cross-culturally true even in us non-hermaphrodites. Primogeniture just means "inheritance of the first-born", with stipulations around gender an addition which varies across cultures in time and place. Primogeniture is really not about marrying "into" or "out of" families: it's not the status of the spouse that matters, but the status of the children. In short, what titles and privileges do they stand to inherit, which their parents inherited in turn? Let's say Al, the first-born child of house Li, marries Bo, a lesser child of house Ka. Li inherits a major Duchy, whereas Bo is given a minor title and a few estates. Their only child, Cho, stands to inherit both claims, but clearly the Duchy will be their most important inheritance. It might be that, due to the disgrace of house Li, Cho decides to style themselves as the first of a new dynasty: the first Ka Duke. Or, for political expedience, they might try to forge a new house of Li-Ka, encouraging their cousins to intermarry and unite the houses. If Cho marries Dee, of house Mu, who also inherits a duchy, things look different again: their first child, Eed, will inherit both titles; the minor titles might be distributed to other children. The new united duchy will either become a powerful united force, under the Li-Mu, or Ka-Mu dynasty, or it will fragment, with rival claimants on either side plotting to rest one or the other title from Eed and their descendants. Any number of combinations are possible, and European history is full of wars fought because of them, and there's no need for gender to play a role at all. 

Maybe you don't see this, but this sounds like a more militarized version of spooks from the "last apprentice" novels. Make their system a trade skill, not a common skill, this will reduce the number but improve the quality. You can ensure quality by providing quality check at the national/regional level. Keeping the numbers low enough will increase their prices and can avoid working for long periods without devolving to bandits. Making sure this position was attainable by most of the population prevents a complete caste system and provides upward mobility to the civilians that do take the initiative to deal with their own problems. Keeping the practitioners local also makes them less likely to extort their clients through force. 

There is already a company in California doing this (soliculture), they are called "smart greenhouses" and use glass tinted magenta. They claim plants grow just as well in their green houses and have the potential to produce solar power as well.
