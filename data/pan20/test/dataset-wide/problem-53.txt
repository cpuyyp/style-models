Disclaimer: When I worked in natural language processing, I wanted to get some intuition on what kind of structures would be parsable, i.e., the recipient could understand them with some varying degree of difficulty. Thus, I created a number of artificial languages just to see how it turns out in practice. So it happens, a lot of them seemed quite alien, but still had some unifying features. What follows below are some quick conclusions drawn from the ideas back then—some might ring true, other may be just plain wrong. On compression: There is one not really surprising characteristic of communication: it tends to get compressed. On average, as long as they are understandable, shorter phrases win. To give you some examples, for example we use "I'm" instead of "I am", there's "gonna" or "I'd" which can mean both "I had" and "I would". Observe that the most frequent words are short, and longer words are rarer—like an evolving Huffman coding algorithm. It might be quite obvious, but it has great ramifications. To give you some concrete examples, it might be one of the reasons behind 

TL;DR I think humans will be competitive for much longer time. Humans are versatile and not that inefficient. They will be doing all sorts of jobs, mostly these which are hard to automate. In my opinion the main problem will be the quality of life, but perhaps that could be solved via some other means. 1. There is an intrinsic value to being a human. Other humans will want to be served by humans, interacting with humans, there will be government-mandated human interfaces to a number of facilities; even if the surgery was performed by a robot, human doctors and nurses will be there helping the patient too. There will be human-run shops, hotels, guest-houses near a lake, etc., perhaps some of the rooms will be rented by robots (e.g. to make a statement or experience a curiosity). In the future human messengers might carry messages sent by AIs. 2. Humans are versatile and not that inefficient. Nature equipped humans with a number of rather good quality sensors and adaptable software. They are easier to direct than robots. Even if we build robots that surpass humans on almost all accounts, such robots will be extremely expensive. When machines break, the repair (or replacement) is just as costly. Moreover, one would have also design such robots, make prototypes, which all just makes it less and less worth it. Hence, robots will take over jobs that are specialized and easy to automate. Humans will handle special cases and hard, ambiguous or un/mis-specified directives (e.g. special customer support). 3. Humans are quite well understood. It's easy to trust human, because we know (to some extent) how a human operates. Some town, village or small country won't be able to produce high-quality robots, and imported robots might have hidden agendas to them. Even if they bring tools to make such robots, these tools might imprint hidden agendas in the produced robots. A fellow human that was born there and grew up with you is just a simpler solution. This implies a number of administrative or high-trust positions. Perhaps that could work the other way too, for example a human can witness something and test it, but won't remember the thing exactly (a bit like zero-knowledge proofs), that is, capabilities of a human scanned against modifications are within known bounds. 4. Humans will merge with robots and AIs. There will be enhancements that greatly improve our capabilities, for example like Google+Wikipedia+fast typing does nowadays ;-) That means jobs just like ours, but on steroids. For example a car mechanic with extended memory might be better at repairing a broken machine than a robot (given that it is costly enough to be worth repairing). 5. Humans like to handle other humans. In my opinion the future will bring a mass growth of bureaucracy (at least in the beginning). A big part of our daily lives will become moving and reshuffling data from one office for yet another bureaucrat and arguing between ourselves. I think that you can't go wrong with giving a character an administrative work. 6. Unknown jobs. Certainly the future will bring some new jobs, probably some of these hard for robots. You don't have to describe them in detail, e.g. you could say that Joe is a whatever-er and daily he goes to the office and whatever-s from dawn to dusk. Quality of life: This is a hard problem, because it is behind a lot of costs for humans. People strive to raise their quality of life and it is hard to accept when it drops. I guess it will have to be substituted with something, e.g. entertainment. To give a more concrete example, imagine that instead of doing boring job, an employee during working hours would play games. Yet, it would have value, because the game would in fact represent the work the employee needs to do, just using a different method and interface. I hope that helps $\ddot\smile$ 

Somehow, the tides were very important and that one domain was much more developed than any other. The forecasts are rather coarse. The forecasts are done only for places which have physical properties that make the flow easy to predict. They don't use forecasts, only observe the tides after the fact. 

To make the language more alien you could incorporate some more channels that would transmit some alien-characteristic meanings of the sentence. An example: In fact, one way to make a language alien is to just dump the whole linear structure thing. Here is a sketch of the idea behind one of the languages I constructed at the time. We start with no word order, and the structure of a sentence is driven by inflections. However, instead of the usual inflections, we make them more abstract: just for now, let's suppose that each word has a prefix with an identifier of its parent in structure, and suffixed with another indentifier that can be used by its children, for example "I ate an apple and a bannana" could be written as (the root and leaves have only one identifier). 

There are many more nuances here, but I will stop now, I think you will get the idea. There is one more final ingredient, after some phrases become very frequent, the boundaries between words and identifiers will blur and some expressions will become words on their own. Although such a language will be most probably agglutinative, it is bound to have certain irregularities, fusions and other quirks. For any language you construct, before it's ready you have to make it alive, even for a moment. Let it evolve for a bit, in your head, or when discussing with a friend. After that, you will need to redesign it a little, fix some flaws, but then there will be some spirit in it. Closing remarks: So that's the example, I hope you like it. There are myriad of ways you could combine it with other features (like the multiple channels). However, please don't make an overkill. Not all the readers/viewers/whatever will be as smart as you, and very few (if anyone at all) will dive deep enough to understand and appreciate such a language. If you make it really alien, it will just confuse them and it might negatively impact on your story. In particular, even if the language is alien, the audience might feel quite good about themselves, when they will guess the rough meaning of an untranslated phrase based on a few previous usages. It might make for a fun, subtle spoiler and perhaps a nice Chekhov's device, but won't work if the language is too complex. I hope this helps ;-) 

Too long for a comment. TL;DR Whatever you do, that effect has to be pretty strong. Explanation: If you have three moons, the tides (depending on the moons' trajectories) might be very chaotic, nowhere near the pre-industrial capabilities of tidal forecasts. We have several possibilities: 

However, when designing an alien civilization (perhaps a conglomerate of different races/species) what would be the dimensions of the civilization progress and purpose? Certainly technology works and so does morality (even if it is blue and orange one). But what about happiness, is there even such a concept for them? Certainly, whatever these would be, they would have a huge impact on the civilization progress and where it went and will go as time passes. In other words, it has quite a big impact on designing aliens for your world (esp. if the time-span is huge). The question: What are the progress/purpose dimensions that we could use for creating an alien civilization? To give some examples: 

I don't think that could have happen in a real world, as freak events are just too rare. On the other hand, as you consider a fictional species, we could make it so that it will be beneficial. First, please note that the reason for both inbreeding and avoiding it is the same: the genetic advantages and disadvantages of them. So, to make it beneficial, we have to create something that will outweigh the other costs. For example, imagine a species with psychic powers. If these are very rare, but on the other hand very powerful, it might make sense to try to strengthen them. Still, if there are other specimens holding similar powers, it will make even more sense to stop inbreeding. So to make it work, it has to be rare, but not very rare (as it would just disappear). Also it has to clearly outweigh other costs, and there has to be some big disadvantages for non-related specimens to get together, e.g. 

I don't believe that human (sentient creatures) progress or its speed is a stable process, so I would find such an occurrence very, very unlikely. Moreover, even by asking your question you assume that their technological level would be comparable. Of course, there are things like Kardashev scale, but it doesn't say very much about the civilization itself (and I get the feeling that it's not exactly the kind of "similar technological level" you had in mind). However, the whole idea is not lost at all. Should you synchronize them in any way (e.g. 5 light years away should be close enough to manage some form of communication), then such a thing might be possible, or even certain, unless the civilization would decide on keep the balance off at all costs. To give some examples: 

The thing is, in my opinion, any alien language will also obey this law, after all, communication is an expenditure of energy. Moreover, there is a well-known tradeoff between complexity and compression, and understanding/processing what the other person said is also costly. Thus, certain constructions will be preferable both in human and non-human languages. Also, aliens of lesser intelligence might use more verbose language, smarter creatures will use more complex structures. Here I'm using "more verbose" or "complex" from the alien perspective, that is, their brain might be constructed in a way that makes some things trivial while other troublesome. To give you a funny example "The rat the cat the dog chased escaped." might be a valid and short sentence of English, but it would be easier for humans if expanded, still it could be easy for an alien who starts reading in both directions (left->right and right->left) simultaneously. In short, in my opinion information theory matters to aliens too and you need an in-story reason to break its principles (and I don't think it is worth it). On linearity: If your aliens communicate with sound, then there is a great chance that their language will be linear. On the other hand, although it might be unfeasible to transfer arbitrary 2D structures this way (for any living creature there is a limit to a precision it can distinguish harmonics), it could be multi-channel transfer. In fact humans do it already: 

Civilization progress has many dimensions, for example technological, moral/ethical, happiness/subjective quality of life, etc. For each such dimension we could state a purpose that reflects it, e.g.
