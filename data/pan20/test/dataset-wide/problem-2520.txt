According to Mahayana doctrine (at least within Nyingma linbeage), different incarnations of body, mind and/or speech of a same sentient being are possible. By which I deduce that a sentient being of a lower realm could also be reborn into a human realm having, say, two bodies of opposite sexes. Hence, given the conditions listed, my questions will be: a) Can a same sentient being be reborn in a human form in two or more body incarnations having opposite sexes? b) If yes, would a sexual union between, say, two such body incarnations of a same sentient being having opposite sexes in a human form count as a sexual misconduct, provided the other requirements for a proper sexual conduct are met? Any reference to a sutra and / or abhidharma text would be of a great help. 

My understanding of this is as follows; Illusion is impure, but a water wave is beyond purity and impurity; May I be reborn in a hell to purify it and save the living beings there. 

It was said in a book by my spiritual master that 'breaking unloyalty to one's spiritual master is worse than breaking a kapala', of which I deduce that breaking a kapala is a really bad sign. Is there any root text explaining what is particularly bad about breaking a kapala and what is the meaning of it? 

The gross psychological interpretations of the 6 realms are as follows: hate (hells), craving (pretas), stupidity (animals), passion (people), belligerance (asuras) and pride (gods, or devas). These are samsaric worlds, which means that even the worlds of gods are still mundane, not 'spiritual'. That means that it is important to understand 'a realm level' for mundane purposes or for understanding another person's / one's own state of mind/existance, that is, at least from the first two Noble Truths, but it's irrelevant from the point of the Fourth Noble Truth (ayam dukkha-nirodha-gamini patipada). There are also four more realms in the Tiantai school and Nichiren lineage that give a way to liberation from the samsaric existance, which makes ten worlds altogether. These are of Learning, Realisation, Boddhisattvas and Buddhahood. As milestones on a path, they are important from the position of the Third and Fourth Noble Truths. In Nichiren lineage, this interpretation results in ichinen-sanzen concept stating that any moment of a human consciousness embraces three thousand different states of mind from the ten worlds. Because a human being can hardly encompass all the three thousand states at a time, it is not important from an [unadvanced] layman's perspective, since in terms of conventional logic we are capable of perceiving only a single state of mind within a given moment. 

Atma doubts that one could accumulate much merits by reading and spreading the Diamond Sutra, but in relation to Dhamma, yes: Iti ยง100 But! Such is not possible for whom how is certain to stingy to give material things and to say "I do not believe in charity because it doesn't cease suffering in a long term and it doesn't solve any fundamental problems in the human world." is fatal wrong. Giving in the meaning of merits means to give and not to do things that it might become as one likes it to have. Grasping for the hole world and even thinking its one own, how could one even make the first step into Dhamma? Such is the benefit of reading and teaching the Diamond Sutra, a plenty good way to cut one self and others from the path... 

Taking a cold shower is a usual way of yogis to stay awake. So if weariness arises such may help but also no quarantine. Walking backward is also a way to force mindfulness and other kinds of "dangers" which give mind a reason to stay on topic. On that level one does not need to think about concentration since one is far way and has actually problems to keep ones persistence arose. A certain danger for concentration would be if the thought come up "oh a cold shower, that would be pleasant" and then give it attention and follow this approach of the defilement beguiling. Taking a cold shower it self is also a good test in regard of ones mindfulness. Can you bear it? How is the relation of mindfulness and reaction to cold water. One could gain awakening or insight by having proper attention (yoniso manasikara) at such event. (Note: this answer has not been given with the agreement to be means of trade or the purpose of/for trade and/or keep people trapped and bound. How you handle it lies in your sphere, but does not excuse the deed here either.) 

One needs to have ambitions to gain liberation, yes. The rest will be hindrances. (Just for information: There is no such as "my" Sangha. [that is actually very "Buddhist", I and my making] There is only Buddhas Sangha and if spoken form it, it refers to the monastic Sangha. If you talk about your group, using parisa is most proper. So people and you do not get confused, as well as your mind does not see things wrong. Weather distance your self for the conventional Sangha nor distance your self form the ideal, will be of benefit for you. Step away for YOUR community might be a great start, although there is no physical need. Trying to be a Buddhist is of course the most wrong ambition, yet they naturally are like that. That what makes the Buddhists. If you like to walk the path, it's certainly another lane, Mr Crab Bucket.) 

I think that depends mainly on the tradition and/or a practice chosen by a person to follow. In Theravada, a person has to follow all the precepts (for a lay person or a bhikshu(ni) accordingly), a qualified answer to your question is to be provided by a scholar. One of the core Theravada obligations, as I understand it, is to achieve Nirvana by obligatory following of all the percepts. In Zen, a person also can be either a qualified master or a mundane follower, yet even an enlightment can be achieved within a single lifetime by any sentien being, even by ; a rebirth to lower realms can be a deliberate choice because of compassion. In addition to usual percepts, specific Zen vows are to be taken. In Mahayana, a person can be a layman, a scholar or ordained monk/nun/lama within an institution, and many depends on previous karma plus a state of mind at the moment when a person experiences death. A person can be either a layman and a scholar or a scholar and an ordained practiotioner; the number of percepts and/or vows to be taken depends on a school and its lineage. In Vajrayana, it is the tantric vows (which in some cases may contradict or exclude those taken by laymen) and their purity that define the outcome, together with a state of mind at the moment of death. A person can be a layman at a superficial appearance, and an ordained practitioner and a well-learned scholar by one's nature. A number and essence of the vows depends on a deity and a transmission lineage together with ethics. 

My questions concern Monkey Year Teaching held by Kagyu lineage (Great Phowa of Chagtsugma). Is this type of Phowa similar for all Monkey Year Teachings held through the Kagyu lineage? What is the destination land and deity of this Phowa? Are there specific samayas and life-long obligations related to this teaching? 

First, we have to distinguish between mundane devas and supramandane deities. The mundane devas can either follow Dharma or not, but usually they do not, because of their illusion of everlasting happiness. This means they are not compassionate and so they don't have a cause to deign to humans, nor human beings have an ability to see them, just like ants don't have ability to see humans and/or communicate with them, or just like humans usually don't treat ants as their peers. Second, those mundane devas who follow Dharma might be compassionate, yet they can hardly be noticed by those humans who haven't achieve an ability to see devas and/or supramandane deities. Last but not least, the supramandane deities require a practitioner to have special abilities and/or to be determined by some special causes to see them. E. g. all the - if I am not mistaken - Kashmiri women put together are the manifestation of the Shri Devi's speech, yet which mortal can perceive all the Kashmiri women at once?
