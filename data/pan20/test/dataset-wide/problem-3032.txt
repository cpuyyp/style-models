There were multiple resolutions, most of which were rejected; that means that there was considerable "sausage making" involved in the resolution. Some language was the product of compromises. I'd go so far as to wager that there was more sausage making than logic. Texas was larger than any other four states; even if that doesn't logically make a difference, it permitted classes of compromises that wouldn't have been possible with smaller states. I infer that they thought a state the size of TX deserved special treatment. (All my friends from TX will support that conclusion). The slavery issue was addressed far more conclusively by the civil war than by the legislation. 

It shows a substantial spike in mentions of "fire safety" in American literature starting in 1970 and going on until almost the end of 70s. What caused this? Was there an increase in federal fire safety mandates? Did a horrific fire incident lead to increased discussion about fires and ways to prevent them? 

The oldest I know of is the destruction of Hamoukar in Syria. In 2005, archaeologists reported finding "collapsed mud-brick walls that had undergone heavy bombardment and ensuing fire" dating to around 3500 B.C. You can read more about the discovery here. 

The founding fathers publicly pledged the lives, their fortunes and their sacred honor to the cause of expanding immigration and naturalization of foreigners. That said Pennsylvania was unique. I don't have good sources on this, but I believe Pauline Maier discusses it in her history of the ratification of the constitution, but Pennsylvania was, as far as I can recall, the only state that was in danger of not being English. (that's an oversimplification; rural PA was full of German speaking immigrants. Philadelphia, at the time the largest US city, was cosmopolitan but distinctively British. That said, the structure of the PA government was distorted by the fractious(update German) minority. If I recall correctly, one of the tactics used to force through a rapid ratification of the constitution was to not print it in German). 

I cannot find much context as to why he gave the statement so I'm not sure what he meant by it. I realize that the French Revolution of 1848 was occurring at that time, so perhaps he is emphatically stating that the ideas of the Revolution do not need to enter Belgian politics? If so, why was he opposed to those ideas? 

Auguste Delfosse, a Belgian politician, is said to have given this statement in the Belgian House of Representatives on March 1, 1848: 

Urban workforces were frequently chartered rather than embedded in a feudal relationship; their relationship with their overlords were distinctly different. Charters often conveyed rights that were denied to serfs. During increase demand for labor (e.g. after a plague or war) feudalism does not provide for incentives to serfs when the demand for labor increases. It was difficult to persuade urban workers to become serfs, which cause a conflict between two visions of society. Urban populations, generally speaking, can earn and maintain wealth; serf populations cannot. This is closely related to #1 

I have read that Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette were both buried in unmarked graves after their executions during the French Revolution. On January 18, 1815, during the Bourbon Restoration, their bodies were exhumed and moved to their current location in the necropolis of French kings at the Basilica of St. Denis. My question is, if they were buried in unmarked graves, how could their bodies be positively identified (or were they even positively identified)? 

In 1968, the Fire Research and Safety Act was passed, forming the National Commission on Fire Prevention and Control. President Lyndon B. Johnson advocated for this legislation in his special message to congress "To Protect the American Consumer" in 1967. 

Good question - you have to dig past the superficial to understand, and I'm not fond of the way it is phrased, but the fundamental question is interesting. Here is one example: 

tl; dr - encirclement creates a mobility advantage for the encircling forces. Ultimately encirclement permits the encircling commander to choose the location, time, conditions, and duration. The defending/encircled force has no options. Melee formations are tightly packed - shields overlap. If you want to survive, you want to be as close as possible to the guy on your left and on your right. They are keeping you alive. The opponents will take advantage of every inch of space between you. You have just enough room to thrust your sword (or spear) forward and back. You and your squad have trained for hundreds of hours to be able to walk forward without losing that tight cohesion - without leaving a gap large enough for an enemy sword to get through. Good squads can move forward and sideways. Excellent squads may be able to execute on the diagonal, but remember if your foot moves to the left or right you're stepping in front of a squadmate. You can see forward. Your helm obscures your vision to left and right. Behind you is a mystery. You cannot turn your body and you can only turn your head slightly. In summary, a melee formation is an armored weapon that points forward, moves forward, attacks forward and is defenseless to the rear. If you enemy can flank you, he can carve you to pieces - if you turn your shield from the front to the side, the front will kill you. If you don't, the side will kill you. There is no option to turn to the rear; people behind you can kill you at no risk to themselves. OP suggests that the formation could form a square. (Aside: Someone challenged me on the point that OP suggests they form a circle; simple geometry tells us that the circumference of the circle expands with the radius; the shields stay the same size; circle is a suicide formation; what you want and what the video linked to below shows is square.) Squares are not mobile. An excellent squad might be able to march in square, but the encircling forces will always have greater mobility. The force with the greater mobility gets to choose where and when to concentrate forces; the encircled force has no options. Somewhere in that square is the weakest link and the encircling forces can attack it mercilessly; the defending (less mobile) forces cannot adapt. The defender must accept that the attack will occur on the weakest possible location and relentlessly. Attackers can use their strongest, freshest forces against the defenders weakest, wounded, tired, forces. Encircling forces can compress the defender - squeezing them together so that they cannot use their weapons at all. Merely advance with spears. Once the defender cannot use weapons, they are standing dead men, Once you're encircled, there is no chance to win, and you know it. The only option is to break out. If you can't break out, you will die when and where your opponent chooses. At the request of several that I provide sources, I spent 15s searching youtube for video of pre-modern formation melee fighting. The narrator notes the requirement for coordination and teamwork. This is a very loose shield wall. Example - note that if the formation were encircled, the officer helping them to navigate and move would be inside the wall and blind (or dead). Participants in the turtle formation are effectively blind. It is very difficult to coordinate the activities within the turtle. If you stop to chat about which way you're going to move, you'll die. What they are doing is very difficult; they do have an officer shouting commands. They don't have people hammering weapons on those shields constantly. THey're walking on a flat field with effectively no obstacles. Imagine how that formation adapts to dead bodies, discarded weapons, mud, etc. Any time the formation slips, the encircling opponent will slip a weapon inside the resulting flaw. Aside: OP asks why encirclement is bad; OP did not ask for an analysis of how Roman forces at Cannae came to be encircled (that is a valid, but distinct question). I'm answering only the question that OP asked. Aside: I'm also relying on my personal experience in fighting multiple opponents - something I do regularly. Mobility is key. It doesn't work the way it does in the movies where the stuntmen stand in a ring (which is conveniently just on the edge of the camera frame so you can't see how inept they are) and wave their weapons vigorously but politely take turns in attacking the protagonist. The moment the combat starts, the defender needs to be in constant motion; the key to success is to move in such a way that the attackers are hampered by their partners. The specifics don't translate to formation fighting, but the principle of greater mobility = greater probability of survival = does translate. 

Were Roman gladiators ever enlisted into the actual Roman military? I have heard of Roman soldiers becoming gladiators but not the other way around. I imagine this would only happen if the Roman generals were desperate, sorely needing men for a campaign, as I doubt that gladiators were trained to fight like actual Roman soldiers. 

It looks like there was a massive spike in the occurrence of "Illuminati" in American literature starting around 1915 and ending around 1921. Why did this occur? Was their an event in American history that caused an increase in interest about the Illuminati? 

I think that ultimately this question is opinion based, but it is interesting and has already generated one good answer so we should leave it open. I think the premise in the first line is unsupported, "Appealing to the divine is a convenient way of making the subjective, objective." There are a number of ways to answer the question - the best is the test that @Semaphore suggests - a textual artifact indicating that the results of a divination are unacceptable for political reasons. I believe there are multiple examples of that happening. If I recall correctly, the Roman campaign against Hannibal featured several battles that were delayed because the general rejected the augury and sent the augur back for another try. Was that the result of the generals subverting the divine process, or was that the action of a devout general who would not reconcile the augury with the tactical situation. Every divination involves some interpretation, and should always reject interpretations that are at odds with observed reality. Henry IV's quote "Paris is worth a mass" might fit into the category, although he wasn't attempting to influence society through religion, he was abandoning his fidelity in favor of political objectives. But I cannot say for sure that his comment was completely cynical. The Chinese dictum of the "Mandate of Heaven" could be invoked - I'm not a Chinese scholar, but I understand this to be a principle that can only be applied ex post facto - the ruler has the Mandate of Heaven, and the only people who can be shown to not have the Mandate of Heaven are deposed and failed rulers. Is this subversion, or a sincere belief that heaven favors the king? Henry VIII of England, Defender of the Faith, abandoned the Roman Catholic faith because of a contradiction between his duty to his dynasty and his duty to his faith, as interpreted by the political decisions of a religious authority. Was that subversive, or a sincere conversion? Constantine fought under the symbol of the cross, but delayed conversion to Christianity for years. Some claim that was an example of subversion, others insist that it was a sincere conversion but mediated by political realities. There are many who assert that the Salem witch trials were an example of young girls living in an oppressively religious household subverting the numinous for practical reasons. Lord Bragg's recent podcast on the subject seems to argue that Tituba subverted her experience with the supernatural to fit a social narrative, influencing them away from killing her. The conversion of Egypt under Amenhotep and the subsequent recidivism has also been posed as an example. Similar accusations have been levelled against Pope Urban VIII whose condemnation of Galileo may have been based on the will of God or on the good of the church. I've read so many narratives that I've lost track, but the last dozen times I encountered writings on the Delphic Oracle, the narratives have assumed that the utterances of the Oracle were bent to fit political realities. Ultimately all religious leaders act in a nebulous area between faith, pragmatics and inspiration. They make choices that are probably sincere - it would take an act of spectacular arrogance to document ones own heresy. 

President Johnson appointed commissioners to the National Commission on Fire Prevention and Control in June of 1971. In 1973, the Commission issued a report entitled America Burning. The report evaluated fire loss in the United States and made recommendations for fire safety legislation. This report led to the Federal Fire Prevention and Control Act of 1974 which created several federal entities "to reduce losses of life and property, through better fire prevention and control". 

I have heard that Hitler, leader of Nazi Germany, and Mussolini, prime minister of Italy, met personally to discuss strategy and seemed to be pretty close allies. I have not heard much about Hitler and Hirohito's relationship however. Did they consider themselves as allies? Did they discuss strategy together?
