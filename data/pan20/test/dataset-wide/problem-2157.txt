You're a contractor when you're getting paid and a freelancer when you're unemployed. But, seriously, in my experience in the USA, here's how it works. A contractor generally works for one client on an exclusive basis through a recruiting/placement firm. They're essentially a temporary employee and will usually be expected to keep certain office hours and so forth. The projects will tend to be longer term, typically 3-12 months, although there are cases where short term projects are farmed out this way. You're paid by the hour, usually on a W2 basis, with the sponsoring company providing some benefits, taking care of employment taxes and taking a cut of the hourly rate. For example, you're paid $40/hr and the client is billed $70/hr for your time, the recruiter pockets the difference. Freelancers generally work for multiple clients and find work on their own. They have a 1099 relationship with the client companies, meaning they're totally responsible for their taxes, including employment taxes, and benefits themselves. Most projects are short term or are on an "on call" basis. Some work on site but often they'll work from their own location and only visit the client office as needed. It's common for freelancers to get overbooked and not be able to complete work for all clients within the required time frames. That's why some companies, those that have been burned, prefer to use contractors since they have greater control. There are some people who have kind of a hybrid arrangement where they work on a 1099 basis without a contracting company taking a cut but the tax laws can get messy if things aren't done right. I screwed this up once and ended up owing the IRS a huge amount of money. 

I'd recommend defining core work hours during which everyone should be in the office. For example, between 10am and noon and 2pm to 4pm. This allows you to schedule meetings, service clients/customers better, increase collaboration and so forth while still allowing a great degree of scheduling flexibility. Given how you've described your company culture I wouldn't go too strict on enforcing something like this. Just put it out as sort of a strong suggestion, stating logical reasons on why you need to do this. In most situations, people will usually get the idea and buy into it. Then they'll build their schedule around it. 

Here's one problem that will cause you to be rejected at some companies without anyone ever reviewing your application: HR automation software. The HR person will plug in 3-7 years experience in whatever into the program. It will read resumes and filter those out that don't meet the criteria. If you put 2 years on your resume, it will be filtered out by the software and no human, not even an HR human, will ever read your information. You can stretch your experience from 2 to 3 years to get by this digital guardian but you will be lying so that could cause you problems down the road. The other alternative is to try to develop contacts with hiring managers who'll be able to bypass the 'bot and HR and give you a chance. 

This is common too. Some people who've been at a company a while will be defensive about their code, especially criticism from a junior programmer. Some are just resistant to change. For example, I've encountered .NET programmers who're quite resistant to learning LINQ, MVC and other newer things and still code like they're on Framework 1.1 or 2.0. But, each software development organization is different. There are good ones and bad ones, high pressure ones and laid back ones, ossified ones and dynamic ones. The one you're in right now seems rather bleak from what you've described. If it's making you that unhappy, it may be time to consider moving on even though the pay and location is good. When you do interview, ask questions to make sure that you're walking into a situation that's a good fit for your personality and skills. Ask them how they handle portable code and standard functionality. Ask about other areas you have concerns about. Do this without mentioning your current employer's ways. Use non-threatening questions to get the answer you need without offending. 

This is kind of thing is common in corporate IT development teams. For example, you may encounter a team that's been using VB since the late 90's and, even though they're on .NET now, they still code in a VB6 style. In other groups, the corporate standard is to only use Microsoft products so being portable to *nix isn't a consideration. Others may be equally divided between IOS and Android developers who don't share code and have no desire to for 'religious' reasons. 

Pay check bouncing - I don't know if you would consider this an HR issue or a management issue. Taxes aren't being paid - If payroll, sales taxes and other corporate taxes aren't being paid this will mean trouble for all. Vendors aren't being paid - When your company car gets repo'ed or the office power gets turned off you should be ready to leave. Severe legal/ethical problems. For example, if you're being asked or pressured into falsifying information (aka lying to customers or vendors), provide a false disposition in a lawsuit and the like. Management/Owners taking excessive money out of the company, preventing it from growing and/or dealing with problems. Moderate profit taking is fine but gutting the company to pay off gambling debts isn't. You have to judge the situation as best you can here. Excessively negative work environment. You might term this an HR issue since it deals with harassment and such. But, if you're being bullied at work and the person doing the bullying is skilled enough to avoid stepping over the HR line, you should move on. Life is too short to deal with jerks like this for long. When a company is about to be bought out by another company. You can almost be certain that they already have "a you" at the other company and you'll be forced out anyway within the year. 

From a US perspective, an interviewer should not ask about anything about outside activities that's not directly work related, primarily to prevent potential lawsuits. A general question like "What do you do in your free time?" is simply too legally dangerous to ask. For example, suppose an interviewee is an active member of a particular religion, cultural or political organization. Asking about it could open the door to legal action if you decided not to hire them. Some people might even see the question as harassment. There are some cases where it might be appropriate to ask as long as there was a work related reason behind the question. For example, some positions in some companies require that the person hired not engage in high risk activities like skydiving or auto racing. Another example would be if you were hiring for a position in a company that provided services to a free time activity. In that case, you might want to ask what the potential employee thought about that activity. In one interview with an auto supply company I was asked about my interest in auto repair and customization. That would be an appropriate question to ask. In general, it's best to avoid asking open ended questions that might take the interview into legally dangerous areas but asking about job related specifics is usually OK. 

This is common too, simply because refactoring a large number of existing applications/code to deal with this has been deemed too costly. It's also likely someone tried to do this in the past and it ended up being a massive failure. If a company spend thousands on a failed refactor they're unlikely to take one up again, even a small scale one, in the short term. 

I've had them look at my personal sites and some client sites I'd been the sole developer on after the face-to-face interview. They could also download code from them (VB.NET, C# and PHP) and look the the HTML/CSS side as well. I don't think most of them looked into the code extensively though. I think that they might have reviewed it more closely if I was applying for strictly web design rather than presenting myself as an all-round solution provider. 

First, I'd recommend finding other medical treatment options if your current meds aren't helping. It sucks to be on meds that screw with you in other ways while not helping you with the problem you're having. They can even make the problem worse. Another option might be yoga or qidong / tai chi. I use this a lot myself to ease pain and stress. This can help you relax and calm yourself down. Here's a video that describes some yoga relaxation techniques and one featuring tai chi. You'll get better results if you have an instructor rather than just following videos, but videos are better than nothing. Also, you may need to make your employer aware of the mental health implications of the Americans with Disabilities Act. While I'm not a big fan of using this legal bludgeon against a company, sometimes it can be used to have draconian, outdated, work rules modified or even in getting a more comfy chair. 

It really depends on the corporate culture. Some organizations place a very high value on the time someone arrives, others on the time someone leaves, some on both and others don't care as long as work gets done and customers are served. One company I interviewed at required everyone, unless otherwise excused, to be on site at 7:30 AM every day. Another didn't have any attendance requirements although it was tacitly expected that certain personnel would work well into the evening at certain times. If you're working as an hourly contractor (through an agency and not on a corp-to-corp basis), you should arrive and leave at specified times and stay the amount of time the client and you (and your agency) agreed upon, no more, no less, unless a change has been agreed upon beforehand. The same would apply if you're working hourly in a perm position. Generally, you'll have less flexibility than perm salaried employees. So, it really depends on your particular situation how it will affect your career. 

It's to your advantage right now that the poor economy in the US right now has led to many people having lengthy gaps in their resume due to unemployment. Initial HR screeners will usually take this into account at most companies (there are exceptions). I had nearly a 6 month gap in my employment due to illness followed by a period of temporary disability and this gap never came up during interviews. Someone else I know had nearly a year off for similar reasons and it didn't come up for them either. So, it may never come up although if all you have is a year experience it will probably be more likely to come up in an interview. If it does come up, just explain, honestly, why you took the time off. I think it reflects well on you that you saved up to do this and didn't run up huge debts doing this or going to school (I'm assuming this is correct). Few people can afford take time off after college these days since they have enormous school loans to pay and other heavy debt and don't have the financial discipline to save money to achieve a goal. Edit in response to your edit: I don't think you need to mention it on your resume unless there's something related to the position you're apply for. For example, if you were applying at a travel company or if foreign language knowledge was a plus. Otherwise, it's like other personal info, you leave it off.
