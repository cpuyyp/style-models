I think the scenario you have outlined is plausible, if not necessary likely. Here is my suggestion for a different way you could implement it: Perhaps this city was built in a river valley/canyon along a long but narrow corridor. There would be plenty of reasons to want to built a city here. The river provides food and transportation, it can act as a key control point for river traffic up and down the river and the shape of the valley can provide natural defenses. In this situation, it makes sense that the rich elites would want to build up the walls of the valley. It's further away from the industrial center of the city along the river, it has better access to light and it's physically higher up. It's not much of a jump to go from here to erecting large bridges over the valley, creating more space for the upper class and making stratification more stark. Town is probably already going to be prone to flooding in the winter and spring as the river swells and wanes naturally, so erecting dykes along the river would make sense, which could gradually transition to walls as events further up river caused it to gradually become larger and as foundations were needed for the upper levels of the city. If it becomes really bad, they might even build a dam to control the waterflow, though this would require at least 1 canal to facilitate river traffic. Wrapping things up, this being a river valley suggests that it's not too terribly far from the mountains, from where a quarry could supply the building materials. In addition to fish caught from the river and crops grown on the fertile (if flood-prone) delta-lands at the mouth of the river, the rich are well positioned to feast on imported food. 

Use some of the electricity generated by the electric turbines to heat up the most important parts to keep them ice free so the turbines can turn. And waste heat rising from a multi story single building city could warm up wind turbines on top of the city. And if the wind turbines are designed to use rising currents of air, the air warmed up by waste heat from the city will provide a steady wind for them to use. 

Just as a child first learns about their own house and later about their own community as they grow older and explore farther, so an ancient society learned more and more about the world and its size as it explored farther and farther. It may be noted that the Sun and the Moon have the same apparent size as seen from Earth. And as someone travels farther and farther from home, and sees the apparent size of the sun and the moon stay about the same no matter where he goes, he can estimate how far away they could have to be to look the same size every where he went, and thus how big they would have to be to look that big at such a distance. Anaxagoras (c. 510-c. 428 BC) proposed that the Sun was even bigger than the Peloponnesus. Thus the Sun should have been at least 180 miles wide and thus at least 20,626.498 miles away to have its apparent angular diameter. Aristarchus of Samos (c.310-230 BC) claimed that the Earth and the planets revolved around the sun, that the earth rotated, and that the stars were distant suns. Aristarchus calculated that the Sun should be 18 to 20 times as far away as the Moon and thus 18 to 20 times as wide. He also calculated that the distance of the Moon was 20 times the radius of the Earth. So the diameter of he Moon would be 0.0872 the diameter of the Earth, and thus the diameter of the sun would be 1.570 to 1.744 times the diameter of Earth. Calculating that the Sun should be significantly larger than the Earth might have persuaded Aristarchus that the Sun was the center of the solar system. Eratosthenes of Cyrene (c. 276-195/194 BC) calculated the circumference of the Earth to an accuracy of 10 or 15 percent. Eratosthenes is also said to have calculated the Sun's diameter at 27 times that of the Earth, a vast understatement. Eratosthenes is said to have calculated the distance to the sun as either 4,080,000 stadia (about 399,799.2 miles) or 804,000,000 stadia (about 78,783,960 miles), the latter being approximately the correct figure. Clautius Ptolemy (c. AD 100-AD 170) calculated the distance to the Moon to be about 60 times Earth's radius, thus making the distance to the Sun using Aristarchus's calculation - 18 to 20 times the distance to the Moon - about 1,080 to 1,200 times Earth's radius and making the Sun's diameter about 4.5 to 5 times the Earth's diameter. So in the late Hellenistic era and Roman era people educated in philosophy knew that some astronomers had evidence that the Sun and the moon were vast balls of rock similar to the Earth. Lucian of Samosata (c.AD 125-after 180) wrote A True History that included a trip to the moon and war between the natives of the Sun, the Moon, and various planets and stars, which were thus depicted as places. That's right the first Space opera was written in the 2nd century AD! Ancient Greek and Romans made many types of glass, including glass clear enough for eyeglasses, telescopes, and microscopes. Lenses may have been used for some purposes in ancient times. So inventing telescopes would not have been totally impossible in Hellenistic and Roman times. Since philosophers had more or less proven that the Sun was much bigger than the Earth, and since Aristarchus, Seleucus of Seleucia (b. 190 BC), Martinus capella (5th century AD), mentioned by Copernicus, and others supported the heliocentric system, telescopic observations that supported the heliocentric system might eventually convince philosophers that the Earth revolved around the sun. The Galilean moons of Jupiter showed that celestial bodies could revolve around bodies other than the Earth. The phases of the planets, showed the geometrical relation between a planet, the Sun, and the Earth at the moment of observation. Repeated observations were a strong argument for the heliocentric model of the solar system. Tycho Brahe (1546-1601) developed a "geo-heliocentric" system in which the Sun and the Moon revolved around the Earth and all the other planets revolved around the Sun. Once the phases of Venus were discovered, only the heliocentric and Tycho's "geo-heliocentric" system could explain them, the plain and millennia old geocentric system could not. Thus observing the phases of Venus would be enough to eventually disprove the geocentric system. 

I think other people have done a good job of going into the probable genesis of such a treaty, so I'll instead go over the clauses that I suspect would be necessary to create the environment you want, as well as the obvious issues with them. As I see it, there are 4 sorts of weapons which are particularly and obviously destructive to an environment, some of which are more useful than others against military targets. They are as follows: Bio-Weapons. This includes both chemical weapons and bio-engineered nasties, which would most likely take the form of Viruses and Bacteria but for completeness sake should include genetically engineered animals as well (no Xenomorphs allowed). These sorts of weapons are a lot more effective on Civilian Targets than military ones and have the potential for spirally wildly out of the control of their creators, so it's not too hard an ask to ban them. Relativistic Weapons. This was covered in another answer, but any material of even extremely minute mass can pack incredible force when accelerated to speeds in access of several KM/s. Such a weapon could casually destroy a space habitat, though it would be a lot less effective on a planetary body with an atmosphere. Worse still, due to the speed of the projectile, it's unlikely that active defenses would be effective against it. It's an effective military weapon, if a potentially expensive one. I think it would be a hard sell to completely ban this sort of technology, but you could theoretically put limits on the number of them, their total power output or perhaps the places where they are acceptable to deploy. If nothing else, it'll be pretty obvious if a space habitat gets hit by one, so assigning blame if one is used inappropriately shouldn't be too difficult. Gravity Weapons. This is where things get really tricky. Any large mass, when thrown at a larger mass, is going to cause some pretty terrible destruction. All you really need is the thrust to maneuver a comet, asteroid or space colony into a decaying orbit and you're going cause wide-scale damage. It's so easy that a military power need not even be involved. The good news is that, once again, this isn't actually a great weapon against military targets. It's slow enough that a military installation can probably move. Even if they can't, it's not going to be particularly accurate and a fortified military base would probably survive a near (in planetary terms) miss. The real problem is that this is an effective terror weapon, both because of the results and because it's so easy to do. Super Weapons. This is something of a catch-all, which is why I've listed it last. A straight ban on any weapon of sufficient size or power would be necessary for obvious reasons. History has shown that major powers will try to cheat this sort of thing, but skirting the rules is a lot better to openly violating them. In this case, any platform that gives a military power the ability to attack without fear of reprisal will make all other restrictions start looking more like quaint suggestions than intergalactic treaty. With this in mind, pretty strict rules should be in place to make building such a platform as hard as possible. On the bright side, this is actually one of the easier suggestions to implement. Superweapons are expensive and, like with bioweapons, limiting their development has historical precedence. Sure, everyone will try to cheat, but as long as they all cheat equally, it will probably work out. 

You might want to check my answer here: Giving Tolkien Architecture a Reality Check: Dwarvish Kingdoms It describes a city within a mountain, or what can be considered a city within a single building. See ckersch's answer here: How many people can you feed per square-kilometer of farmland?1 It seems to me that a multistory city within a single building would be easier to keep warm in cold climates since the waste heat produced by lower floors would rise and help warm the higher floors. If solar panels and/or wind turbines were placed on top of the city waste heat rising from the city might warm them enough to keep them free of ice and snow. And if the electricity source is inside the multistory single building city the power lines will be protected from the wind and weather outside. Maybe the electricity would be generated by generators powered by imported diesel fuel. Maybe a nearby waterfall would power electric generators. Maybe during the arctic summer solar panels would generate electricity. Maybe wind turbines would generate electricity. Maybe nuclear reactors would generate electricity. Maybe in the future fusion reactors would generate electricity. Maybe if several cities are built in the arctic region several different methods would be used to generate electricity. Note that I don't discuss geothermal energy because that will probably be unimportant unless the cities are built near specific geothermal hot spots, and I don't know if there are any in the Arctic. 

A celestial body of some sort seems like a good choice here. Halley's Comet, for example, comes close enough to the Earth to be seen with the naked eye every 75 years. It is in fact notable because it appears so frequently. A comet that came so close to earth everyone couple hundred thousand years or would not be absurd. Comets are also mostly water, so if you are partial to dropping stuff out of space for your cataclysm, one could have been literally slammed into the planet with the effect of a sea level rise. I would expect such an impact to have other bad effects for life on the planet, but since it was drawn it in with magic in this scenario, I don't think it's unreasonable that the same magic was used to mitigate the effect. Conversely, for lowering the water level, siphon the oceans into a passing comet. This is a little less sciency, but again, magic. 

You are the despotic ruler of the entire world. This means that you have absolute rule over what is and is not law and can set any arbitrary policy you see fit. Importantly, as you are the undisputed ruler of the entire world, you have no competition or outside influences upon your kingdom. With this in mind, You have the sole last say on the value of currency Your money cannot be devalued relative to another because there is no other currency. If it is backed by a real resource (like oil or gold) then its value can be taken at face value as being equivalent to whichever exchange it is backed by. If it's not backed by a real resource, then its worth is solely determined by the value assigned to it by people, with you the absolute monarch being able to dictate that value. In short, the money is worth as much as you say it is, because no one is around to tell you otherwise. Mind you, this is something that will work better the less scarcity there is. If there is significant scarcity, then people will likely skirt your restrictions, possibly forming black markets and other bad stuff that you don't want. Re-sellers and smugglers will always exist. But why stop there? You have absolutely authority, so start seizing the means of production. Take apart artificial scarcities that do not benefit your new world order, flood the market with goods and put resources into transportation infrastructure to control local scarcity as much as possible as well. Hire as many middle men as needed to micro-manage the whole world's economy and set prices, wages, interest rates and other economic indicators to whatever place you need them to be. 

If you live in a village in Saxon Britain you are all three of those definitions, but you don't define yourself as Saxon when aliens invade, and defining yourself as human when the Vikings come along won't do you much good because they're human too. 

I think you're indirectly asking about scope. Any world deals with levels of encapsulation. The lower down the levels the bigger the frequency. As with anything the higher the frequency of something the more time it takes to develop it so therefore the more likely a person is to create quick methods of applying detail to it. Lucas vs. Tolkien The model for each franchise is identical, the scope is not. Lucas' top-level encapsulation is a universe, Tolkien chose a planet. Lucas' universe has many planets, Tolkien's planet has many regions. Lucas' universe has swamp planets, Tolkien's planet has swamp regions. It all comes down to how many examples of a specific level of encapsulation you have. If you're doing a universe like Lucas, you most likely don't have the time to describe all of your planets to the same level of detail as Tolkien did with Arda. 

That depends on how close to the time of the split you are asking from. The closer to the time, the more likely it is to be visible. Once a river finds a new route it will flow in that direction. Over time the majority of water will continue on this new route eroding more material, making it even easier for more water to choose the new route. Eventually the new route of the river would be made deep enough to accommodate the full watershed making the original route obsolete. It would become a dry-river bed. Think about gorges or creeks in this regard. It is very unlikely that both possible routes for the river to reach the sea will erode material at similar enough speeds to keep them completely equal. EDIT: To answer more fully, the speed of the shift from one route to another depends on the comparison of the erodibility of the material that the two routes flow through/over. Old route stone vs. new route stone the process will be slower. Old route stone vs. new route clay the process will be much quicker. 

The best way to survive on an otherwise hostile planet is to build a space base with an enclosed ecosystem there. The best way to keep a planet's atmosphere from escaping into space is to enclose parts of the planet, or the entire planet, with a giant roof or roofs to keep the air in, and to keep repairing the roof(s). But if you are going for a more natural way to have a partially habitable planet, I should point out that Earth is mostly uninhabitable for humans, though almost entirely habitable for various lifeforms. The oceans produce a lot of oxygen we breath, and water evaporated from the oceans is the source of the fresh water we drink to stay alive. But if you are teleported to a random position on Earth, it will probably be a spot on the surface of the ocean, and you will probably drown. An d if you are teleported to a random position on land, there will be a significant chance you will die of thirst, starvation, or exposure to hostile temperatures. I would suggest that for your planet, it might be good to calculate a mass and volume, and thus density, that gives it a somewhat higher surface gravity, so that the atmosphere is more compressed, and also a somewhat lower escape velocity so it looses atmosphere faster. And also make it with less of a magnetic field to protect the atmosphere from loss. The highest known human town, La Rinconada in Peru, population 30,000, has an altitude of 5,100 meters or 16,728 feet. This Wikipedia list: $URL$ Has nine countries with settlements over 4,000 meters (13,123.36 feet) elevation. Thus there are tens or hundreds of thousands of humans today who have adapted to living above 4,000 meters permanently, although many people have difficulty with much lower altitudes. Thus if the pressure at sea level of your planet was the same as at 4,000 meters on Earth, native intelligent beings could easily have evolved to flourish at that pressure. At 4,000 meters above sea level the air pressure is only 0.85 that at sea level. 

The simple answer is to determine which is the stronger of the two cultures, and bastardise the names from the weaker into the stronger. The theory here is that people from the weaker culture will feel the need to assimilate into the stronger to survive, which will probably require them to change their names to fit in with the acceptable concepts of naming convention. How do you Anglicise the Hungarian name Istvan? Steven (Stephen). Sharing the same language doesn't mean they share the same culture. Language and culture are completely different things. Language is a communication tool, culture is an expression of communal identity. Naming conventions themselves are pretty fascinating. There's generally 3 known conventions, of which one is now pretty much universally used in modern societies. It's important to understand that a naming convention is how we determine someone's name. There is a second layer to them which I will explain in a bit. 

Standard Anglo-cultures use the direct adoption method. I take my father's surname, as he took his father's surname etc. Just to note; traditionally, Anglo-culture is patrilineal, which is why we take our father's surname. In modern times there is the accepted practice of ambilineal naming, wherein we apply a double-barrel surname (mother's & father's combined with a hyphen). Traditional Norse, Hebrew & Arabic cultures make use of the gender classification method. Here are some examples: Norse: father's given name + -son, -dottir appended. (Still used in Iceland I believe) Karl Magnusson. Hebrew: father's given name + ben prepended. Simon ben Gabriel Arabic: father;s given name + ibn prepended. Ahmed ibn Mohammed
