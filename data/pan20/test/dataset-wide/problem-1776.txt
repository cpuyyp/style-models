What I need is to extend /dev/vda5 from 80 to 160 GB without losing data. I would like to be sure that I can't do it wrong (this is also why I did not do any experiments on my own). So if someone knows how to do step-by-step, so that it can't get wrong, I would be very grateful. It is possible for me to run another tool too, but I guess that would be much more difficult. Update 1: I have tried system-config-lvm, but I am in the same position, here is the pic: 

Here I can see the /dev/sda2 (local virtual machine) even starts on the same sector as /dev/vda2 (real server). Same for /dev/sda5 and /dev/vda5. 

Short answer: Yes Long answer: It depends entirely on how many clients do you expect each service to be handling. If you have an SQL server that is used by an application to its limits, so that it hardly catching up with its tasks, you do not want the machine to do other non-trivial tasks. But I guess you would be aware of this if this was the case, so most likely, in your specific case, there will not be any problem to use it for all the services you have mention. DNS servers are quite efficient, so unless you are going to serve public requests for very famous domains, you should be just fine. SQL servers need most of the resources usually. It depends on applications that use them. From your list, it is SQL server that you have to be careful with. Mail servers are rarely demanding on resources, so again, unless you expect to be processing hundreds of thousands of emails daily, feel free ti include. DHCP server - no problems here either. 

Have you exported the self-signed certificate with the private key and imported that to the iphone? Other users can't connect either i suppose? Since the Iphone doesn't trust the certificate now you need to import that to the phone. Otherwise you must buy a third party certificate that the iphone already trust. 

Verify the settings on the "Client" Receive Connector that the appropriate authentication is set and that the permission group is set to Exchange Users. 

Having a bit of a problem with my greenfield installation of Exchange Server 2013. Environment: Windows Server 2012, 4 Exchange Servers (collocated CAS/MBX roles), Outlook 2010. HLB is arriving next week, until then I have configured DNS RR for both autodiscover.company.com and mail.company.com. If starting outlook on a domain joined pc, autodiscover and outlook anywhere is working perfect. If starting outlook on a non-domain joined pc and enter my email address it does an autodiscover lookup using A record (autodiscover.company.com) and it resolves the guid. but I cannot logon to the server. If I do it manually I cannt enter the proxyname (mail.company.com) I have to enter a exchangeservernamefqdn, then it works. 

You already have A record that says "mx.websolutions.com.ar" is "198.50.148.166", this is required for OVH VPS. So nothing to do here. This needs to be propagated well, so that OVH servers can see it that way (but you already have this, so just saying ...). Log in to your OVH manager Navigate to Web -> Platforms (left sidebar, in the middle of the screen) and select your VPS (something like vps123456.ovh.net) At the bottom you have IP Addresses - click IP tab (the second one) In the right bottom corner, click on Manage IP You should see the table of IP addresses with third column being called "Reverse" or "PTR" or something like that. Click the "-" in this column on the row with your IP address. Then enter your host name "mx.websolutions.com.ar" and click OK sign. Wait until propagated well (e.g. use dns propagation checker to check that or just wait long enough). You are done :) 

I'm looking for a solution to updates - I really need all my flash and Java updates to be installed automatically as soon as they are available. Microsoft Updates pro - updates all versions and office products con - some big updates require administrative permissions, then I have to go around to all the computers and put in credentials myself con - only does Microsoft updates Security Center Configuration Manager / Security Center Essentials Pro - it will do all 3rd party updates that have an msi file Pro - it will do all Microsoft updates con - cost, server license, and time to setup there has to be something in between the 2 I per-fer not to devote a server to just updating, but will if necessary Anyone have any ideas? 

I would like to provide a direct connection for my SQL server on the 2nd network card that connects directly to a 2008 Web server. I'm aware that I would want to use a crossover cable and I wouldn't want to use a default gateway on either side of the connection. However I'm not sure what else I would need to configure to make this work well. Any Ideas anyone? This would be a temporary solution until I could get a vlan in place. The goal is to eliminate all other traffic as well as isolate the communication between the 2 servers. Thanks In Advance Phygg 

You could try use the Outlook Profile Analyzer to see some outlook statistics there. If not using circular logging you could look and see how many logs that are generated per day. Then I think you could use perfmon to see the amount of traffic utilized on the loggshipping NIC (if you have a separated replication NIC) 

First of try to identify the policy that might be the one samping these addresses. You can fine-tune it to be applied to just mailboxes or contacts... ... or create a new one for just contacts. To clean up the mess powershell is there for you if you need to do bulk changes. 

Are you having a single Exchange server with CAS/HT/MBX role? Clients are connecting differently nowdays. I think Outlook 2003 still connects towards the MBX while Outlook 2007/2010/Entourage connects towards the CAS role. Is the firewall enabled? 

Update 3: I have setup a similar machine locally in VMware. In my local setup, instead of /dev/vda* I've got /dev/sda* and the disk size is 20 GB instead of 80 GB and the new space that I want to add is 30 GB instead of 80 GB, otherwise it is the same. I can see in GParted the very same situation, it behaves exactly the same as the real server, the /dev/sda5 can't be resized. Here are my attempts with fdisk: 

It is hard to guess, but my would be a redirection, more specifically HTTP -> HTTPS redirection. In order to be it this case, there would need to be redirect from HTTP to HTTPS on your server and you possibly do not see those in your logs because you might have them at different place. So, the scenario would be that the client for some reason (some form somewhere misses right scheme) POSTs to HTTP, gets redirect code and navigates with GET to HTTPS. If this is not the case, it could be different redirection (like non-www to www prefix or alike). You should be see those in the logs, but you might miss them for some reason (filtering somehow based on HTTP code?). But this is not as likely as HTTP->HTTPS redirection. So, is this it or can you prove that this is not the case? 

I've been tasked to find for a solution that will allow me to use 1 storage location for 2 different web servers' applicaiton data. My problem is that these 2 web servers will both be accessing the same files. I need a way to lock the file if 1 server is using the file so it can't be accessed by the other server until the server is done accessing the file. I'm using licensed VMware ESXi 4.1 for my hosts, Windows 2008 r2 web edition with IIS. I have both of these servers hooked into redundant switches going to an iSCSI San. I'm told that I need a 3rd party software that will allow me to do this, because I'll be using ntfs for my SAN Volume that will store the data. This is an active/active configuration. Does anyone have any idea how I can make this work or what other software I might need to control the file accesss. I'm told that this ability is not suppported natively in Windows 2008 web or IIS. Thank you 

My hosting is IPv4 only. My question is whether it is possible to allow IPv6 only clients to access my web (running Window Server 2012 R2). Is this possible using technologies like 6to4 or Teredo or something different that I can just install on my server + create AAAA DNS record and it will work? Or do these technologies require configuration on both ends, so that it won't just work even if setup properly on server side? Note that I do not mind performance impact due to any kind of tunneling. Subquestion: And vice versa - is it possible for my server to access other servers via IPv6 after some kind of configuration? 

If I do the same on my Windows 10 desktop, I get success and can work with the share folder and map it. And I am not sure what I have not tried yet, but I have checked these: 1) network connection properties of server B, if server B has enabled Client for Microsoft Networks - yes; if server B has enabled File and Printer Sharing for Microsoft Networks - yes 2) I have tried advanced properties of IPv4 -> WINS tab -> Enable NETBIOS over TCP/IP (made no difference to default, both A and B have static IPv4) 3) enabling Network discovery and allowing its firewall rules in firewall.cpl + same for File and Printer Sharing and their rules; again made no difference What am I missing. How can I access shared folder from Windows Server 2012 R2 acting as client. 

Windows 2003 functional level domain which includes... 2 windows 2008 Domain Controllers with integrated DNS serves, one of the 2 servers is a RODC. DHCP is giving our both IP address of DNS servers. my question - how do I setup the DNS to roll over when one server is unavailable? Right now the first DNS server in the domain is acting like a master/primary. When I reboot the DC with the FMSO roles, (first DC), no one can log in and DNS goes completely down until the server comes back up. My 2nd DC doesn't do anything i would expect. Seems I remember that there is a setting that I can change to set a timeout of how long the first DC can be down before the 2nd DC will take over. Anyone remember anything like this? It may be that I'm not following best practices at all, although I thought I was following them when it came to designing my AD and DNS. Any ideas? 

I understand the question as follows: 1) You have bought a domain from Provider1. This is your domain registrar and you can manage your DNS record within their interface. 2) You have bought a website hosting from Provider2. This is a different company. 3) You want to connect your DNS record with your hosting so that if you type mysite.com into browser, you will see your pages loading. 4) You know IP address (let's assume it is 1.2.3.4) of the web hosting server with Provider2 and you have already created DNS A record that says mysite.com is 1.2.3.4. 5) It does not work. If this describes your situation well, then there are two things I can think of that can go wrong: A) You created the DNS record, but did not wait long enough for the record to be propagated world wide and the DNS server that you use for your address resolving, does not have this updated record yet. You can use DNS Propagation Checker to get information on how well is your DNS record propagated over the distributed network. You can also flush your local DNS cache to prevent your operating system local cache from giving you the old records. B) You have not inform Provider2 that your hosting program should accept requests for mysite.com. How to fix this depends entirely on your web hosting provider's interface. However, you can tell if this is the case if you put your address into the browser and different page than you expect (which is your web application page) is displayed to you. 

Go into Powershell or the console and look at the properties (SMTP adresses) on both particular users. It seems that one of the users might have gotten a wrong policy so that the correct smtp domain might not be listed on the mailbox. 

What type of outlook version are you using? Outlook 2003 works different from Outlook 2007/2010. Can you please specify the credentials settings for OwaVirtualDirectory and Microsoft-Server-ActiveSync directory. I would also point out the need of correct InternalUrl and ExternalUrl. By the way, microsoft-server-activesync is only for mobile devices, not for Outlook clients! 

1) So domainjoined pc works perfekt, but not non-domain joined (never gets pass the basic screen). 2) Test-OutlookWebServices = Autodiscover: Outlook Provider failure (if using -debug I cannot see any errors). 3) How come if using netstat on a client computer I can see the connection towards the server hosting the active mailboxdatabase. Should'nt I see the proxy (mail.company.com?) 4) Shall InternalNLBBypassUrl be serverfqdn, proxy fqdn or $null? When first installed it was empty, but after a reset of ews vdir it got the serverfqdn field configured!
