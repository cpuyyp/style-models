Being fresh out of school, many interview processes will ask for a resume and a copy of my latest official grades from college/university. I happen to have one of the classes I have taken, that was particularly relevant to my field, that had me finish with a terrible, but still passing, grade. (I needed 60 to pass, and got 61.4). I figured that there must be many people who pass by the skin of their teeth, therefore it shouldn't be such a surprise to an employer. But I also happen to have very good grades in basically every other course, almost always above 85, so I don't want to come across as one of the people who pass with bad grades because of their abilities. The thing is, I almost failed that class because I skipped the final exam, that was Worth 35% of the grade. This is because I had two final exams that were scheduled at the exact same time, so I went to the other one, since I could pass that course without it (I would have failed the other course by missing their exam). I had tried basically everything with the school to either move or retake one of them, but the only options available were creating other conflicts, therefore not solving the problem. I was following a non-standard study path, and ended up with many courses that were not expected to be taken at the same time during that semester. How can I explain that grade without sounding like I'm making excuses, in the context of a job interview? I feel like I have a good reason, but I guess everyone probably feels that way and the interviewer most likely heard every excuse in the book already. 

What are you not certain about? You say both offer and company are good, so you need to decide what exactly you are waiting for in the job search. Of course something better could always come around, but will it? Some candidates do not want to take the first job offer given (using the 'don't buy the first car you test drive' theory), but what if that offer is indeed the best? 

I think the key here is 'considering'. If the parties who scheduled the interview were absolutely aware that these interviewers were active candidates for the job, or if they were aware that these interviewers were even considering throwing their hats into the ring, then I would expect they would/should not be involved in the process. This is also assuming that the company has a large enough number of employees to choose from for the interview panel. At a smaller company, there may be few options. As others have mentioned, going to HR is another option. Depending on the size of the company, you may want to be careful about that, as you may be seen as someone who is 'telling' on your competitors before anything has even happened. If the other candidates have not come forward yet and you only know they are considering applying from personal conversations, I'd be careful with what you say at this point. Good luck! 

I am currently working as an intern (with a good pay). I have had trouble on my project, and took more time than what was expected of me to find what was wrong with a part of it. Now the deadline is coming, and I know I can't make it. Since the internship is almost over (2 weeks left), and I'm not studying in the same city, I can't continue working for this company after it is done. I am not supposed to work more than X hours per week, and I am not entitled to any sort of overtime. On the other hand, the schedule is flexible, so it is possible to work more hours on certains days and fewer on other, as long as we do X hours a week. In that case, I could work about 5-6 extra hours while still staying withing the allowed work hours, before that deadline. I care a lot more about making a good impression on my employers, so that I can either get hired there after I'm done with school, or at least get a decent recommendation, than I care about the money. I wouldn't mind at all working those extra hours and not saying anything, so essentially doing those hours without pay. My main question is: Are there are downsides, like breaking some sort of law (I am in Canada), to doing this unpaid overtime without saying anything, to make the deadline? On the other hand, how bad would it be for me if I failed to do it on time, when talking about recommendation letters and resumes? They originally thought this project would take 2 days for a full time employee, so they gave me a week to do it. Since I couldn't finish, they gave me an extra week, but mentioned that this was the longest they could give me, because after that my manager (who has to see the project to give his ok) will leave for some time, and we probably won't see each other before the end of my intership. I know I'm a lot behind schedule, and I am fully accepting that it is my fault. I didn't know the programming language very well, so ran into many unexpected problems that I didn't solve fast enough. 

I would say that without any proof, you are on pretty shaky ground and it would come down to his word versus yours and it's likely that the more senior employee would be believed either by the MD or your co-workers. Personally (and this is without experience of working for this type of firm/in the broker industry), if it is not noticeably affecting his ability to do his job, then it is of no business of anyones. Unless there are strict clauses in employment contracts about behaviour whilst on the company premises that he is contravening then he is not really doing anything wrong. I'm not sure what would be gained by mentioning this to your co-workers unless you already have an issue with the branch manager for some other reason. 

It's not as obvious as some people think so I'll add it here - magnets on the side of PCs/CPUs are a no-no. IT Support staff all have war stories surrounding this! 

Their first reaction is always surprise. Even if he/she wasn't surprised, that has to be the initial reaction if a counter offer is to be made. If you had asked any decent recruiter or career expert what would happen after your resignation, they would have predicted the steps that your company made with a high degree of certainty. Any company that is about to make a counter offer first has to act surprised, then say what big things are in store for you (new projects, a promotion you had coming). This is standard fare. 

One week is a fairly reasonable amount of time to provide for an answer (in case you were wondering). 

I don't think it is unethical for you at all. You have found some people you would like to potentially work with, and you are contacting them. Whether you met them at work or through a job ad seems somewhat irrelevant from your standpoint (as an individual employee). If this were a client of your firm, that might be a bit different and could be violating your contract, but as you describe it the situation doesn't seem to be an ethical question for you. I think the ethics question will probably be more difficult for the vendor if they choose to speak with you, even if you are the one approaching them. Your firm may get a bad taste about you leaving for this vendor, even if both you and the vendor are clear about your pursuit of the job. But that is not for you to worry about. The fact that you mention that you are looking to jump ship certainly helps your argument. You are looking to leave regardless, and this vendor is one option. The company may be less inclined to hold a grudge against the vendor if it is clear that you are unhappy and seeking new opportunities. 

NO! Until you have an offer letter from a new employer in your hand, do not tell your boss/colleagues/company that you are looking for another job If you have a lot of tasks assigned to you when you hand your notice in, you will still have the same amount of notice period, regardless. Part of the responsibility for handing out all these tasks is with your manager to manage handover/cover/failover - what if you were hit by a bus tomorrow? Making you the single point of failure does not always mean it is up to YOU! to manage cover etc 

It is not your responsibility to tell your boss you are thinking of leaving/they need to hire another person. I'm assuming you have a notice period in your contract and if so, this is there for their benefit as much as yours. As you quite rightly say in your post, this could lead to an awkward relationship/atmosphere which is another reason to look after yourself first. Plus, what if you do broach the subject and then do not find another position for a while? The awkward atmosphere would have to be endured for far longer than you probably anticipated. Keep quiet. Let them do their job and look after yourself!! 

In my field of work, for some reason, the hiring companies all put out their job offers at the same time (within a few days of each other), and do the hiring during the same period in the case of students fresh out of college applying for jobs. This might be because most companies offer to pay for Professional exams that we have to take in the first years of employement after we're done with University, so it might be some sort of agreement because of competition. I'm not familiar with the why. This phenomenon is happening across the country, but that specific time period differs depending on the location. In my case, I currently live with my parents in city A, where I have gone to university. City A has several companies that hire in my field, but not that many. I will be graduating in spring, and the offers in my city will be available in December. Since I was not 100% certain I'd be able to get a job on my first try, and I didn't want to live off my parents when I'm done with school, I also applied with several employers in city B, which is about 3 hours (car) from here, and a much bigger city. I am not a fan of big cities, so I would much rather work in city A, but I wouldn't mind moving to city B if the alternative is no work. The problem is that city B released all their offers recently. I applied, did a few interviews, and got one offer. I cannot reasonably wait until December to give them my answer. If I say no on the off-chance that I'll be hired in city A, then there was really no point in applying to city B. But if I say yes, can I still apply to the city A offers? Would it be professionally acceptable to do interviews with other employers after accepting an offer already, and would it be ethical, if I get hired in my prefered location, to change my mind and tell the other company I won't be working for them after accepting their offer, considering I haven't worked with them yet and they have months to find someone else anyway? I wouldn't have wasted their money on training, which will happen if I go work with them and find a job in city A two years from now. Furthermore, the current offer that I have to decide on are not hiring me for late-spring, as soon as I graduate, but for next September, because they said that they wouldn't have the resources to train me efficiently during the summer. Would getting a city A offer for May or June make a difference on the "is it acceptable" point? EDIT: The country is Canada, if that makes a difference. EDIT regarding the similar question. I am not asking whether I should keep looking, but whether I am allowed to without it looking bad. I want to apply to very specific jobs, and I had planned to before getting the offer. Furthermore, I wouldn't be looking "in case I get a better offer", but knowing fully well that any offer I would get would be better (because of the location), so I would want to take it. 

Personally, I would phone back and ask to speak to the person who interviewed you and make a casual "I just wanted to check that you had my email address correct" or perhaps "I've been having problems with emails not coming through and wanted to check I have not missed one from you" (less preferable) Make it not about chasing but just that you are confirming they have the correct information. If they have genuinely forgotten, it will hopefully prompt them to send the email through with the details. If there is another reason why the email has come through (as per your gut feeling), they will simply confirm the email address is correct. If you then do not receive anything, your gut was correct 

A lot of prospective employers now have a glance at a candidate's LinkedIn profile. I've written a couple of recommendations for ex-colleagues there in the hope that they will be seen by recruiting companies. It tends to hold more weight than the simple "number of connections" algorithm Most people put the link to their LinkedIn profile on their CV these days too (I do!) 

Recruiter here with 15 years of experience. You absolutely want to tell the recruiters you have worked with as soon as possible that you have accepted a position. Chances are the recruiter will ask questions and perhaps try to sway your decision, and since recruiters only get paid for making a placement, there is even a chance that the recruiter will go back to the companies that presented offers to see if they will sweeten the pot a bit and up the offer. If you are 100% decided on accepting one offer, be firm with the recruiters and let them know that you have passed on your commitment to your new employer. Be sure to thank them for their time, and if they treated you well you may want to let them know that you would pass their name along to anyone that you knew was looking for work. Recruiters love referrals, and you don't want to burn any bridges with the recruiter or the hiring companies themselves. You could ask the recruiters if they object to you reaching out directly to the hiring companies with a call/email to thank them for their time and for their consideration. I would have no problem with allowing my candidates to follow-up after declining an offer, but some might have an issue with it (the recruiters that have an issue are the ones you should worry about, and you may be more inclined to contact those particular companies directly). The appropriate person to address the letter to would be the interview team, and HR as well if you had a fair amount of contact with them during the offer process.
