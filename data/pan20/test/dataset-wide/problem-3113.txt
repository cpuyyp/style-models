Voting(at least in the US) was originally designed to revolve around land owner(freeholder) families. So the intention was that someone who was pulled together enough(paid taxes-as there was no income tax, had a legitimate interest in the community and most likely wasn't beholden to the very rich) to own property free and clear was the type of person who should vote, and that person's vote would represent their entire family's(and slaves/workers) view point. So in the US it was more of an argument about the family vs the individual and in fact this discussion is still continuing today revolving around the equal rights amendment ($URL$ - supported by the excellent historical figure Alice Paul. This amendment would (potentially) remove things like tax breaks for married couples among other things, and so has a group of people, especially women, who oppose it. eg $URL$ 

Almost every1 power station that produces electricity uses steam to power its turbines. Only the heat source (of energy): burning fossil fuels like coal, oil, natural gas or using nuclear fission, is different. That is why all power stations are located near a water source, so that they can have unlimited supply of water to heat. There are some steam engines remaining operational in locomotives and boats around the world either for tourist attraction or for the lack of reach of new technology. 

The first part of your question is based on a false premise (or presumption), which is that "...the trend to violence towards homosexuals has ended...". There are no indications that the mentality and the way of thinking, regarding homosexuals, in some social groups has changed. 

All these answer are right to some extent but there was one critical moment when IIRC General Preston, his artillery officer tried to convince him to take to guerrilla warfare. But Lee was already thinking far ahead. He, like Grant and Lincoln knew that the Union had to be healed back into a functioning whole. The best interest of the South and North now rested with the rapid reintegration of South back into the Union. Arguably, it was in the four years he lived after the war in which he became the hero that the Myth of the Lost Cause had tried to foist on him. He used his enormous moral authority and charisma to stamp out any violence and speed reintegration. If he'd lived another 10 or 15 years, the history of American might have been much better. Instead, in 1877, we got Civil War 1.5, the Democrats Strike back in which they murdered or drove out all the Republicans from the South while at the same launching a similar war of terror in the North to establish the all-white Unions and lock in the big city Democrat machines. The mostly Irish thugs in the North that murdered "scabs" and fought the Pinkerton's who defended them, became the basis of America organized crime, which formed a complex with the unions and the party machines. It's possible Lee could have prevented some of that had he lived longer. He did try to ensure that Freedmen were allowed their 2nd Amendment rights as well as opposing the early Jim Crow laws that sought to prevent skilled Freedman like blacksmiths from competing on an equal basis with whites. 

The strong social movements of the late 50's and 60's shed light on the subject of homosexuality and violence, and since then it has become an important social problem, seeking solution from the widespread public in the US, and later in the areas of influence of the Western World. 

we note the label Bulgari on the same Balkan area: Now, the existence of Old Great Bulgaria dates back to (at least) 632 AD (if we don't consider the Nominalia of the Bulgarian khans)and its location is on the Western Pontic–Caspian steppe which is far away from the Balkan Peninsula. Having in mind the above: Question Could it be claimed that there were Bulgarians in the Balkans long before the "...Bulgar tribes under the leadership of Asparukh moved south across the Danube in 681 AD..."? 

As said above, TED's answer was a good one, and JackArbiter was close on conclusion(that the climate is a factor), but way off on explanation in my opinion. Climate is a major factor Early on, I would say that surviving the winter required colonists to work together. Colonists and later frontier farmers would spend the summer farming, and then hunker down for the winter and wait it out. If you ran out of potatoes, etc, you would ask a neighbor if they could spare some so you could make it through. That food scaricity is mentioned here: $URL$ 

To convert all in same units: d = 4010 mi = 6453 km and u = 5 knots = 10 km/h, to get the time we use the following equation of motion: t = d / u = 6453 / 10 = 645 hours => 27 days in the ideal situation. However, in reality weather conditions like storms, ocean currents2 etc, would prolong the journey up to 6 - 8 weeks. 

In ancient Greece homosexuality was, if not a norm, at least not a subject of disgust. The same could be claimed for the ancient Roman Empire. It should be noted that, in both examples the classification of sexuality was performed based on different criteria, namely, in terms of sexul activeness and passiveness, or in other words, of dominance and submissiveness. 

There are two great myths of the Civil War. The Southern myth is that it was a matter of State's right i.e. not allowing a distant part of the country control another. In Europe, it was be like Finland making all the important decisions for Spain. Sounds good on the surface but Southern Slavarchy would trample all over the right of other states when they wished. Pennsylvania effectively outlawed slavery in 1780, 12 years prior to the constitution but in the eyes of the Slavarchy that meant nothing whereas the fact that slavery predated the constitution by two centuries did. The Fugitive Slave act and the Dredd Scott decision basically imposed slavery on all states in law and only mob violence and the lynching of the odd slave catcher held it back. But really the purest expression is found in the Constitution of the Confederation itself 

The relics were returned back after three years. Why would the relics of a local saint be of any use to Béla III, could they be used as a form of legitimation of his title, having in mind that the Bulgarian and Hungarian dynasty blood lines at that time were connected? Could Saint Ivan of Rila be heir of emperor Boris I? 

P.S. There is an interesing documentary by Stephen Fry which investigates homophobia and its origins throughout the World. One of its conculsions is the importance of laws and their latency, "inertia", long term effects and consequences on society.
