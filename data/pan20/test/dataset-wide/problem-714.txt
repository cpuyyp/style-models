When you stretch a chain the distance between pegs become longer than designed. Even fatal chain stretch cannot be easily identified by looking at the chain. There are very simple yet accurate chain scales used to identify whether the stretch is none (new chain), fair, acceptable, "replace the chain", "replace all chain and sprockets". Another way to estimate the chain stretch is to try to lift the chain from the sprocket. The further you can lift it, the more stretched chain you have. One can see the chain is stretched far above the "replace the chain ASAP" level when the teeth on small sprockets are no more symmetrical and become worn from the rear side (upper teeth of the rear sprocket). When the chain starts skipping over the teeth, whole drivetrain it worn out and the chain still looks quite good to many people and is still very strong in tension and the peg-to-peg distance is stetched in orders of tenths of milimeters. Another reason for not-stretching a chain is the momentum one can produce on such bike. The crank arm is shorter on kid bikes than on the "full size" bikes. Therefore the tensile force you have applied to the chain was lower than you are able to apply on your bike. Since you were able to load the chain with weaker forces and even hard stretch will be negligible to wrong setup the only option left is that you have moved the rear wheel a bit front. Realign it, as others already suggested, and tighten it. It is worth nothing to get the chain measured for the wear, though. 

SRAM's current lowest-level groupset is Apex, which is a ten-speed setup and Rider_X says that SRAM have never made a nine-speed road groupset. Campagnolo also only seem to offer ten- and eleven-speed, so Shimano Sora is the only nine-speed in the current line-ups of the big three. 

Drop handlebars give a rather different riding position to flat bars. They tend to be narrower (much narrower if you cycle on the tops), farther forwards (if you're using the hoods) and lower (if you're on the drops, but probably on the hoods, too). If you're not used to riding in that position, 100km per day is going to be very hard work. It'll probably hurt your back and also your neck from having to bend it more to see where you're going. I recommend sticking with what you're used to. Enjoy your holiday on a bike like the one you ride at home. If you want to start riding with drop bars, do that on time that (a) you're not paying for and (b) you don't have huge "This is going to be the awesomest week!" expectations for. 

The argument you are facing is false, obviously. The expenses may be divided in two parts, investments and running costs. Let's call investments all the money you have to pay to have a car i shape and legal. In case of a car there are money you have to pay to buy it, the insurance costs, annual oil change, etc. In case of the bike there are money to buy it, tyres, helmet, lights etc. Let's call the running costs all the money you have to inevitalby pay to get somewhere. In case of a car it is petrol, tyre wear, brake wear, etc. In case of a bike it is tyre wear, brake wear and your body fat (or a brakfast, you ate in the morning). The reason for daily commuting is based on a significant difference between running costs, which are not investments at all. Actually, not using a car results in no brake wear, no fuel consumption and limmited tyre wear and oil degradation. In my particullar case I spend 7k/yr on the insurance (mandatory insurance + windscreen insurance + animal collision), 1k/yr on motor oil and 5k/month on the fuel. Ignoring additional costs on brakes, wipers, screenwash, filters, etc. It's easy to see that the "investments" (I had allready paid in January) are a small money compared to the fuel costs (I have to pay every single month). Last year I drove 30k km - to work, weekend visits, holidays, etc. There might be a case one bought a car for one purpose: drive it to work and back.Here, switching from driving to riding may be considered as a waste of investments - money spent on insurance and owning are no more used. Suggest another use of the car - weekend trips etc. Therefore the "invested money" are reasonably used and the argument of wasted investment is proved false. One can temporarily or definitely exclude the car from the database and doesn't need to pay the insurance (and mustn't use the car). 

No, a sticker on its own proves nothing: there's nothing to stop you walking down the street, putting a sticker on the nicest bike you see and claiming that it was stolen from you. However, a sticker would suggest that the claim the bike was yours isn't completely ridiculous, especially if the sticker obviously wasn't put on the bike two minutes ago. It would provide some indication that the bike you'd found was potentially your stolen bike, rather than just another bike with the same brand and colour. But to actually prove the bike was yours, you'd need more evidence such as purchase receipts or information about the bike that you'd provided to your insurer. Of course, a thief would be likely to remove the sticker. 

I am not sure what is happening actually. If you change the gear index by one and chain goes two it is a problem. Usually caused by misaligned derailleur - you are, say, in 3.9 position and change to 2.4, index shows 3 and 2, respectively, but the chain aligns to 4th and changes to 2nd gear. If you are able to change indexes not only by 1, or by more, per one push, it is not a bug. It is a feature allowing you to downshift much faster when you need downshift fast. If you are able to downshift by 2 gears only, there might be problem, though. Maybe one lever in the mechanism isn't alligned properly and it misses to lock the first position. Old lever or twist gear systems allow this fast change by design, indexed system needs "reload" to be able to change. 

It will depend very much on the quality of the tubes. But, look, tubes aren't exactly expensive. Why not just replace them and your spares, for peace of mind and to reduce (by whatever margin) the probability of having to mess about at the side of the road when you wanted to be riding your bike? 

This depends very much on the situation, and on local law. For example, suppose the road isn't wide enough that a car can safely pass a bike. In this case, it may be better to ride two-abreast because that makes it impossible for cars to pass, whereas riding in single file might result in some cars trying to make unsafe passing manoeuvres. Conversely, if the road is wide enough to allow cars to safely overtake a single bicycle but not two bikes side by side, it's likely to be safer – and more polite! – to ride in single file. 

Do not ride in rain This is absolutely foolproof, but it doesn't solve the problem if you want/need to ride. Do not wear glasses in the rain You will have clear view, but in heavy rain and/or higher wind this is painful and may be dangerous. They who must wear corrective glasses cannot use that option for sure. Wear helmet with visor When riding relatively slow the helmet makes sort of roof over your face protecting your glasses from the rain. Visor gives extra room for protection. (Thanks, @Criggie) In high winds and heavy rain it is useless. Use hydrophobic-coated glasses Such (super-)hydrophobic coatings repell water from the surface. Some are polymer-based which are relatively cheap but are vulnereable to scratching and oils. Rare earth ceramics are investigated to sort these drawbacks out, but might be very expensive. Surf sunglasses, Adidas glasses are available. Use MotoGP helmet for wet races These helmet have double visor with sealed gap. Regradless how you sweat, the visor is still bright without any fogging. The visor is also cvered with set of hydrophobic foils (when worn out, they tear one layer away uncovering new one), or there are two cassettes for hydrophobic tape covering the visor (one cassette with unused tape and second for the used part, when the visor is wetting, racer can roll out new part), or the visor is covered by hydrophobic coating. This option is most expensive, Byt you will have ultimate head protection and comfort in cold weather. 

Using the 28T chainring doesn't move the top derailleur pulley any farther from the cog, so using a longer chain won't make any difference. It doesn't seem to cause any problems for me, though I don't use the 34T rear cog very often: it's too much of a jump in gear ratios from the next one down, which is a 24T. However, I don't have the same model of Tourney derailleur as you. Your derailleur looks like the RD-A070 and Shimano's compatibility listings indicate that this is only compatible with freewheels whose largest cog is a 28T. 

Front wheel is there for steering and braking. Rear wheel is there for acceleration and keeping the track. More stable front wheel will make it harder for you to turn and keep the desired track. On the other hand, rear wheel is fixed to the frame (exluding its rotation) and its enhanced stability also stabilise the bike and you. 

Note that hydrophobic film will create separated water droplet that will easily move on the surface - on the bike they will be blown sideways and drop off. Superhydrophobic surface will repel the water droplets as a wall repels tennis balls. 

Safer for whom? Cycling on the sidewalk transfers risk from you to pedestrians without their consent. If you feel that the roads are too dangerous to cycle on, you have the option of getting off and walking. If a pedestrian feels that the sidewalks are too dangerous to walk on because of all the cyclists, what are they supposed to do? If a child runs out of a garden right into your path, what are you going to do? How is that risk under your control? The sidewalk is supposed to be safe for them but I guarantee that, if you cycle into a small child, they'll come off much worse than you. 

It seems that you were braking only with the rear brake and used front as an emergency. This is the least effective way how to slow down. I often brake with rear wheel sliding, sometimes locked. When braking, the most of the energy is absorbed by front brakes. The deceleration puts mass to the front wheel and remove it from the rear wheel. The best way for braking is brake more with the front brakes, brace againts the handlebars and move the centre of mass as far as possible to the rear and low. This will reduce the risk of throwing off. For long descents it is better to brake hard and then release, then brake hard again. But, sometimes the best way is to find a soft place to land.
