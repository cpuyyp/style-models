There are four branches of Buddhism. Theravadin, Mahayana, and Zen Buddhism are three branches that have come to the attention of the West, Pure Land Buddhism much less so. All four offer very profound teachings of the Buddha, but have very different psychologies, values, practices, and views of Enlightenment. You must pay attention to your intuitions and feelings if you are to select one of these paths to Enlightenment. Far be it for me to try to influence your choice. However, with regard to your cultural experiences of the value of mathematics and physics, I can say that Theravadin psychology comes closest to being scientific in the sense that it is a strictly causal theory that, at least in principle, could be translated into a scientific theory. At the same time, I need to say that, just as modern physics is very difficult to understand, so also is Theravadin psychology difficult to understand and not needed to practice mindfulness meditation. In all four branches, practice is the key to progress. The choice is yours to make. I am not qualified to advise you on the nature of Hindu (Persian) branches of contemplative theory and practice. 

I suggest that a lack of discipline or motivation to practice mindfulness meditation can remedied by providing a psychological explanation of how mindfulness actually works. Such an explanation is necessarily complex because the mind happens to be extremely complex. Although an explanation can be provided in either Theravadin or Mahayana terminology, I will provide an explanation within the Theravadin tradition because it is entirely within the realm of relative truth in which an complete explanation is possible and acceptable. Within this tradition, the logical beginning of an explanation begins with the concept of sankhara. A sophisticated and useful translation of this Pali term is provided by the English term schema (as developed by Immanuel Kant), which is a mental disposition that is formed when experience is transformed (understood, interpreted into) into a belief. The resulting sankhara then becomes the cause of related perceptions, beliefs, wishes, motives, actions, and other experiences. In general, a very large system of sankhara is the cause of all intelligent behaviour, including wholesome, unwholesome, and functional actions and experiences. There are innate, developmental, educational, and traumatic sankhara. The innate and developmental sankhara cause those (mostly unconscious) cognitive processes that can be called Bodhicitta processes. Educational sankhara are those sankhara that we learn from other people. Traumatic sankhara are maladaptive (unwholesome) sankhara the result from the encounter with harmful circumstances. There are three problems with learning sankhara: (1) we make mistakes in learning, (2) the application of any sankhara requires adjustments, and (3) sankhara are never complete (except in trivial cases). Special safeguard processes have the function of avoiding, detecting, and correcting errors in learning and assist with the application of sankhara. One of the most fundamental safeguard sankharas is the psychological fact that (1) we cannot understand something unless it makes sense to us and (2) we cannot do something unless it makes sense to us. Since mindfulness meditation involves developing an objective, alert, and discerning state of mind, some unwholesome (illusory, false, invalid, poorly conceived) sankhara no longer make sense and thereby become subject to correction or modification. The process of correction is largely signless (animitta). Some sankhara are resolved only through the recollection of the experience that created a traumatic sankhara. This can be accomplished through a process called focusing, a form of self-therapy developed by Eugene Gendlin. By focusing on the "felt sense" (the body in the body), long forgotten experiences can be recalled and unwholesome sankhara can be unlearned. A third benefit of mindfulness meditation practice is a contact with the wisdom and love of the Bodhicitta (innate sankhara). Through this kind of contact, a person is able to perceive the evidence perceived by the Buddha that formed the basis of his wisdom and love. These are three ways in which mindfulness meditation actually works. In is based upon 50 years of experience. I am 76 years old and an ordained (novice) monk. 

Suffering motivates the practice of mindfulness meditation, only if (1) a person understands what type of experience constitutes suffering, (2) a person understands the causes of such suffering, and (3) a person understands how mindfulness meditation removes the causes of such suffering. There is a psychology behind mindfulness meditation that is not easy to understand. You can ask a meditation master who is accustomed to Western students. Or you can read my book on meditation. 

It is sufficient to understand the psychology of mindfulness meditation to be appropriately motivated to practice it. But relative certainty about this psychology can be based only upon skill in very advanced states of mindfulness meditation during which a person can systematically observe the unconscious processes that create karma. This advanced practice is traditionally practiced after Enlightenment by meditating on the Theravadin Abhidharma. The reasonable person seeks evidence, not certainty. No knowledge is certain. At best, knowledge can only make sense given the evidence. This is the nature of the mind. 

In general, of course, unlikely events are accidental. And physical events, such as an earthquake, are always accidental. But, if an event, such as meeting someone seemingly by accident, is caused by somebody making decisions, it is remotely possible that karma may be involved. Old friends for previous lifetimes sometimes seek one another out by unconsciously making the right decisions that lead to an “accidental” meeting. Such events are rare. And, when they do occur, there is usually supporting evidence, such as finding one another very familiar in the case of a meeting of old friends. I would suggest that you look for substantial evidence before “embracing” such an event, especially if it requires significant cost or sacrifice. 

According to Theravadin Buddhist tradition some 500 Arahats attended the First Buddhist Council soon after the death of the Buddha. I do not know what truth is findable in everything, but it is most certainly not the truth of Theravadin Buddhism and it is most certainly not the truth of Mahayana Buddhism. The truth of Mahayana Buddhism cannot be realized without the experience of Sunyata (Emptiness) and the subsequent realization of Absolute Truth. The truth of Theravadin Buddhism is in the Buddhist psychology of sankhara, which along with Nirvana, is acquired through mindfulness meditation, which is not just “any” practice, but “the only way to Enlightenment.” As for your last question, let us look at the facts. Considering that achieving Arahatship (Enlightenment in the Theravadin view) is so difficult, the sangha must have been a “massive group” to have had 500 Arahats among them. And concerning the “nature” of relative truth (there was only relative truth back then because Nagarjuna did not show up until several centuries later), we would do well to wonder what kind of truth brought 500 students to Enlightenment. Given the specific nature of the Theravadin teachings, the most likely relative truth that would qualify for such a role would be the psychology of sankhara. Relative truth or knowledge, including knowledge about sankhara, is based upon evidence. In this regard, the concept of sankhara is not an ideal. Even though an in-depth understanding of sankhara depends upon evidence acquired through the (knowledge-seeking) siddhi, it is nonetheless empirical (scientific) in nature. It is the nature of empirical knowledge that it is understandable to anyone who has the background knowledge of the context and evidence supporting a statement of fact. However, the notion that an empirical fact is “findable in everything” is nonsense. Having suggested that the psychology of sankhara helped 500 Arahats achieve Enlightenment, it would be in violation of my vows as a Buddhist monk to be compassionate and to teach Buddhadharma to not provide at least a proper definition of the concept of sankhara. From a psychological point of view, a sankhara (schema) is a sophisticated system of beliefs, memories, motives, and other propositional attitudes that make it possible for us to makes sense of experience and to formulate action-plans that make sense to us. From a Theravadin point of view, sankhara are the causes of both suffering and Enlightenment. Mindfulness meditation provides a means by which we can revise unwholesome sankhara and to recover those sankhara that provide the awareness and the wisdom that make Enlightenment possible. Just for the record, understanding sankhara is a profound challenge for modern psychology to define and explain. 

Of course, there is nothing wrong with accumulating ideas, especially if they turn out to be useful. And if the head band helps you do that, why not use it? But there can be no doubt that you are not practicing Buddhist mindfulness meditation as it is described in the Satipatthana Sutta. Indeed, the meditation you describe prevents mindfulness from doing its job. I have just published a book called "How Mindfulness Meditation Works". It will be available in a month or so. 

I am afraid you have acquired a common misconception of the Buddhist concept of anatta. At the time, the Buddha was objecting to a concept of self based upon an experience of self while in a state of full samadhi. In this illusory state, the self seems to exist all by itself without being caused in any way. The Buddha taught a concept of self that is the same as the modern scientific and philosophical concept of self. From this modern point of view, a self-concept is the product of our efforts to make sense of our common-sense experience of ourselves. The concept of self to which the Buddha objected is now extremely rare. What you have acknowledged is the confusion that comes from talking about the causes of action in two different ways. In our common-sense understanding of the causality of action, we can refer to object-causality or to process-causality. An example of object-causality would consist of talking about a baseball breaking a window or talking about a person trying to solve a puzzle. In this case, a person is viewed as an agent of his or her actions. An example of process-causality would consist of talking about the process of energy being transferred from the baseball to the pane of glass, causing it to shatter or talking about a person formulating a plan of action that may solve a puzzle. Both explanations are talking about the same thing. Both are correct, although the process-approach allows for more scientific detail. Concerning your question about changing the direction of the bus called life, I suggest you look into the process of learning explained by the Buddhist concept of sankhara and how mindfulness meditation helps you unlearned confusing sankhara. You can read my book on the subject if you like. 

In the Theravadin Buddhist tradition, the compulsive pursuit of pleasure is a hindrance (nivarana) to access collectedness (upacara samadhi) necessary for acquiring insight (panna, vipassana). Experiencing pleasure, strictly speaking, is not a hindrance. Instead, strictly speaking, a hindrance occurs only when it displaces or delays the experience of upacara samadhi. If the cemetery contemplations or the meditation on the repulsive parts of the body does not temporarily suspend your automatic pursuit of sensuous pleasure, then many months or even years of mindfulness meditation and monastic seclusion may be required to help you settle for more subtle sources of comfort and peace. There is no blame to be assigned because of a strong need for sensuous pleasure, because it is caused by a previous experience of great and tragic suffering. As you suggest, there are many meditation practices that are pleasant or even blissful. The answer to your question is “yes.” But, be certain that indifference to or “detachment” from pleasure of all kinds is not a path to Enlightenment. 

Equanimity is easier to deal with than deluded emotion. But it is psychological insight that leads to Enlightenment in the Theravadin teachings. In the Satipatthana Sutta, the objective is to gain insight both “internally” (insight into one’s own karma) and “externally” (insight into the karma of others). Hence, the more important question is not about taking action, but one about the practice of mindfulness meditation. What steps can be taken to better understand this other person? What kind of psychological history has caused this person to be the way they are? What, if anything, can one do to help this person on the path of their Enlightenment? What kind of actions might one perform (such as “cause and effect”) that would only cause the other person to be more confused, unwholesome, or perhaps more enraged? (The Buddha never taught “cause and effect.”) 

Clarification can come from looking at the fourth precept of the ten precepts, which requires the novice monk or nun to “refrain from lying.” In traditional Theravadin Buddhist practice, a monk or nun aspires to not only refrain from lying but to actively practice the opposite of lying. This practice consists of actively valuing truth, honesty, and the well-being of others. Such values have a multitude of consequences in real life. For example, to value truth is to seek truth and to be honest includes being honest with oneself. If a monk or nun is to seek truth and to be honest with oneself with regard to being actively concerned with the well-being of others, then three practices necessarily follow: (1) One must aspire (strictly speaking, precepts are aspirations rather than hard rules) to practice the awareness of the views, feelings, motives, and experiences of other people, so that one can take into account their well-being. (2) One must aspire to practice the awareness of the impact of one’s actions upon others and making appropriate adjustments. And (3) one must aspire to practice actively looking for ways in which one can be helpful to others. In the Suttas, the Buddha addressed many specific situations. In order to takes into account the many seemingly contradictions found in the Suttas, it is traditionally assumed that the Buddha was often addressing special situations. 

The Wisdom Library has provided an excellent reply to your first question. See $URL$ For a definition of Nibbana, see $URL$ When I visited Rumtek Monastery in Sikkim, India, to see the late 16th Karmapa some 30 years ago, a Tibetan friend told me that, according to Tibetan Buddhism, infants (including his own, who had just been born) are born Enlightened. This observation is neither affirmed nor denied in the Theravadin teachings. The feelings of a newborn infant are truly extraordinary, in my experience. 

Sankhara as a karmic-formation can be understood to be a schema, as defined by Immanuel Kant. From this point of view, sankhara as a cognitive process that transforms experience into belief. For example, by means of a sankhara process can take a set of sensations of a chair and "put them together" into a concept of a chair, in this way a person acquires perceptual knowledge about chairs. Kant called this a process of synthesis. Subsequent experiences with chairs can result in the growth or development of this perceptual knowledge, such as having feelings about and a desire for our favorite chair. The process of "putting together" is a form of mental action and therefore a form of kamma (karma in Sanskrit). The product of the process of "putting together" is "that which has been put together," which is also called sankhara. Defined in this way, sankhara or schemata are the cause of all intelligent behavior such as perception, feeling, believing, wishing, knowing, and having emotions. Such behavior can be wholesome, unwholesome, or functional. In advanced states of mindfulness meditation, it is possible to access the history of a karmic-formation and, if necessary, correct, revise, or unlearn it. I have written a book on how mindfulness meditation works that relates meditation to various sankhara. 

First of all, the Holocaust is best viewed as a multitude of crimes performed by a multitude of individuals. Each victim was killed or harmed by a large number of crimes. You seem to be suggesting that each crime is somehow caused (and justified) by the past actions of the victim! If so, then you are perpetuating a profound disservice to the Great Teachings of the Buddha. I have already provided a partial answer under the Buddhist Stack item “Does everything happen for a reason?” If you have in mind kamma-vipaka, then I have provided an explanation under item “What is the deal with ‘instant’ Karma?” But, if I am correct in my assessment of your view of the concept of “karma,” then you have failed to grasp one of the most profound dimensions of the Buddhadharma. Please allow me to explain. In providing an explanation, I will expand on the concept of sankhara, briefly defined in my reply to item “Unity of Wisdom.” According to the teachings of Theravadin Buddhism, the Abhidharma provides a causal description of every mental event, including Enlightenment itself, the causes of suffering, the causes of the cessation of suffering, and the nature of karma. According to the Abhidharma, each and every mental event, mental process, and mental action has causes and consequences that make sense to a person who understands the Theravadin Abhidharma. (Just for the record, a person does not need to understand the Abhidharma in order to achieve Enlightenment. Indeed, according to tradition, a monk or nun studies the Abhidharma only after Enlightenment because it is extremely difficult to fully understand and because it requires special siddhis to explore.) Nonetheless, a basic understanding of karma can be acquired through understanding the concept of sankhara. The concept of sankhara explains how all forms of intelligent consciousness are possible. From a modern point of view, the concept of sankhara is a scientific theory that is equivalent to the theory of everything (TOE) in quantum physics. In essence, it explains how the mind makes sense of experience. The concept of sankhara has a double meaning. One meaning views the sankhara as a sophisticated structure or system of interrelated beliefs, wishes, values, perceptions, motives, memories, and other propositional attitudes. This structure is formed or modified in response to experience. It is the product of a process of learning or adaptation. It makes sense of experience. The second meaning consists of the (largely unconscious) cognitive or mental processes that occurs when this system is engaged to provide an intelligent response to a specific situation. This adaptive process generally involves various adjustments and corrections that generate a perception, understanding, feeling, motive, desire, recollection, emotion, or thought process that makes sense under the circumstances. The mind has a vast storage of sankhara that, in a well-organized way, cause all of our experiences and all of our behaviour. In this context, the mental actions (karma) that cause the formation or modification of a sankhara are those actions that determine our experience and behaviour in the future. To say that such actions can cause us to be murdered by a Nazi soldier in the remote future is nothing short of bizarre and a profound distortion of the Theravadin concept of causality.
