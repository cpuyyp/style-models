You seem to be interpreting this as a huge slight and you may be over-thinking things. It might simply be that he doesn't really feel he knows you well enough to write a useful reference, just as he says. I can see why this is inconvenient but in the absence of any evidence that something else is afoot I think the best thing to do is to respect his decision and get a reference from someone who knows you better. Who knows, you might end up with a better reference from doing that, too. It certainly seems counter-productive to try and insist on a reference from someone who doesn't seem to want to provide one, regardless of their reasons for that. 

They may wish to discuss the terms of the offer with you because some aspects of it are complex. They may be expecting to negotiate an offer with you, which is faster face to face than it is via email. It may also be that back when email was less common (or even didn't really exist outside of education and very large corps at all) someone wrote down in the HR manual that This Is How Things Were To Be Done and the reasons have been lost in the mists of time. It sounds like you're rather resentful of this. I'm not sure why but it should be a good thing to talk over an offer with a potential new employer. It's a chance to make sure you're absolutely clear on the terms of the offer and that any queries or questions you have will be answered. "Arm twisting" also goes both ways, remember, though if you see the relationship in those terms before even signing up to it then you may wish to continue your search for employment elsewhere. You don't have to accept terms you dislike simply because they're offered verbally. You don't have to accept anything until its agreed on and handed to you as a written contract. The last few job offers I had were handled by telephone. Not quite face to face but still very immediate, and this wasn't a problem. I made my points, they made theirs and then we met somewhere in the middle. 

Firstly, I would suggest that if this one person that you're having a problem with then it might be either one of you that's the root cause of the problem or it might be a simple personality clash. If it's several people (as implied by 'employees') then this suggests that the problem is with you, I'm afraid. 

You should apply as normal. If they've computerised their systems then they'll know you're re-applying for the post. This really shouldn't matter unless you were rejected for some fundamental incompatibility with the employer (and that doesn't seem to be the case). Follow their usual application process to the best of your ability, no more and no less. You say you have ego problems - remember that this will not serve you well; you need to show in your application that you will solve the problem they're having which means carefully reading the person spec and job details and showing in your resume and/or covering letter how you meet those needs. Don't assume that "it should be obvious", which is a common fault I see with applicants who have an overly high opinion of themselves. 

How is the game being positioned to the employees? If they're being asked to participate unpaid, after hours; or they cannot see the value of the games then you will always have a struggle to convince people to attend. Is the aim of the game to boost morale or to improve teamwork? If it's the latter then you can mandate attendance to some degree (though if it's being done in someone's own time, don't expect mandating attendance to win you many friends). If it's the former then you need to proceed more carefully and accept that some people simply are not interested. It's much easier for a 'forced' attempt to build morale to fail than it is for one to succeed. If you want people to attend then make it optional but add incentives to attend and to participate. Prizes of some kind - maybe Amazon vouchers or lunch for the winning team, or suchlike? I'd also agree with Joe's comments about getting buy-in from senior management. If people know that the CEO will be taking part as another participant, not as just the quiz host / master of ceremonies then they might feel more encourage to relax and take part. Funnily enough, I stumbled upon an article today that talked about team building exercises and 'games' in the workplace which I found interesting. I think the whole article and the comments there are well worth a read in the context of this question, but the 'rules' at the end are worth quoting here I think: 

I don't think this is an IT-specific thing. I think its common for the "rainmakers" in a company to be treated well. It's a simple matter of investing in the core business of the company, the people who earn the company money are those the company most needs to attract and retain in order to pay the bills, including the salary of people in departments that are seen as "cost centres", such as IT departments in non-IT centric businesses. Lawyers in a legal firm might have better perks than a lawyer working as a legal adviser to a technology company in the same way that IT workers in an IT/technology company will have better perks than IT people supporting a law firm. This is a separate issue from whether or not you are being compensated "fairly" for your role in comparison to other people in similar roles in similar companies. 

I feel strongly that you and your boss both deserve the warnings you each got for deploying a hotfix live into production and then going to lunch. The fact that you were ordered to deploy the hotfix live is your bosses mistake (and possibly yours for not pushing back strongly - there are times where my bosses might ask me to do something that I know is dangerous and I'd be expected to refuse and point out why as the subject matter expert for that area). But fine, we'll give this one to your boss, this is where he earned his warning. The fact that you then went for lunch when you knew there was a live run about to take place with client data is absolutely mind-boggling. I'm sorry but this is the time at which your written warning was truly earned, and I don't see how appealing will help. You needed to be around to take responsibility and ownership of any issues that occurred with this fix and you fell down on this by going to lunch at the exact wrong time. 

If people are turning you down after accepting your initial offer then you need to ask yourself why. You should also be asking them why, if possible, too. I've always said that job interviews and application processes are a two-way street: The candidate is interviewing you at the same time you are interviewing them. This applies at the contract stage too. I've twice verbally accepted offers and then changed my mind once the written contract arrived for me to sign. On one of those occasions I discovered a problem with the terms of the contract that made me decide I didn't want to work for that company. When I spoke to them they offered to remove that term from my contract, but I felt that I didn't want to work for a company that would write that kind of contract in the first place. On the second occasion, the offer was made from their end on the basis of "I suppose you'll do" and I got another offer from an employer who said "You're exactly what we want. Come to us and we'll do great things together". Needless to say I found the latter more attractive than the former. This isn't so different from an employer offering a job and getting a contract signed "pending references" and later rescinding the offer based on something in a reference they disliked. So what do you do? 

This suggests to me that the problem may not be a fault in your work per se, but rather an issue of politics. If the CEO has decided to carve out a niche for a friend in a part of the business that affects you then this might be the whole problem in itself, not something that you are doing or not doing. As for what to do about it, if you have the right sort of relationship with your manager then ask them. If you don't feel you can do that then do you have a management peer or a mentor outside the line of fire who might be able to give you an impartial view, or share any gossip they may have heard? 

It's usually better to hand your notice to your line manager or immediate supervisor, to discuss reasons for quitting, hand-over requirements, etc. However, it's worth remembering that notice is just that, notice. You're putting the company on notice that you will be quitting (usually on such-and-such a date, in line with the terms of your contract), you're not asking permission to quit. As such, in the absence of your line management and especially if there's a time-critical aspect to your need to submit notice by a certain date, it's perfectly reasonable to hand your notice to HR. With regard to discussing your intention to leave with colleagues, I would suggest that you absolutely not do so prior to submitting your notice. I'd also suggest being very careful about what you do discuss with colleagues prior to speaking to your supervisor. If you wish to discuss your discontent (assuming that's why you wish to leave!) then I simply wouldn't do so at all, no good will come of it. I'm suggesting caution above because even now as a student, you should be looking to build and enhance a reputation for professional behaviour at all times while at work. If you wish to hand projects over then ideally I'd suggest waiting until you've talked with your supervisor first but again, if this is time critical (e.g. you wish to hand in notice during your probation notice so you can quit and finish work completely today) then obviously you'd need to hand things over to a colleague rather than just walk away and leave things floating. 

You will not raise employee morale by requiring them to attend team building events that they themselves have to pay for. You will, at least, improve team cohesion - they will all come together to hate their company managers in general and the fool who suggested they pay for something the employer should be providing in particular. The effectiveness of team building events is suspect anyway. If a group of people have low morale then shoving them into a room and making them play party games or look at powerpoint presentations that use the word "team" a lot will not improve their morale. Figuring out what has made them unhappy and addressing it head on is far more likely to be effective. If a team is unhappy within itself, e.g. team members are just not "gelling" together effectively then again, party games are not going to fix that and again, addressing the issue head on will help. There are quite a few posts on the subject on the Ask A Manager website and you should, in particular, read the spinoffs on intuit.com: "How to team build" and "5 ways to avoid needing a team building event". 

As noted in the comments, if you want chapter and verse on corporate policy for your prospective employer you will need to ask them. If you're just trying to find out what a reasonable person would expense for dining in their local area without wanting to make them think you're planning to 'soak' the expense account, I would suggest asking your Interview contacts if there's any place they'd recommend and/or that they know the company uses for entertaining. 

I'd suggest going with "I'm not sure what you're asking me for here". The more normal "Why should we hire you?" question is giving you a chance to sell your skills and how they fit with the vacancy but this question is not even really the opposite. They're digging for someone who can admit to their weaknesses, but doing so in a very odd way. As discussed elsewhere in the comments this is very difficult to answer without resorting to lame platitudes "don't hire me if you want people who won't work too hard" but it's hard to answer because it is a bad question, not because it's a good but difficult one. An interview is a two-way process and this question reflects poorly on the person asking it; pseudo-clever re-wording of a traditional interview question does not a great new question make. 

I'm assuming you're this person's manager (or at least team leader) because you talk of them working below you, but you also talk about them being a co-worker. A couple of thoughts spring to mind. Firstly as a manager, stop using and thinking the term "won" or "win" in regards to a dispute with someone who works for you. You're there to lead the team, not win arguements and if you give any slight impression that you think in terms of "wins" against your team members then you will always have problems with your team. Secondly, if they're invested in doing things one way and you're now requiring them to do it a different way and/or they have any perception that you think "I have won" then of course they're going to be upset and of course this might manifest itself as behaviour akin to sulking. If you stop picking at the 'scar' then this will fade over time. The problem really happens when their job performance is affected by their 'sulking'. Here my first thought would be to make it clear to them that they are under-performing and that they need to fix that problem. This may not always work well depending on the type of person they are, of course, but it's good place to start. Don't tie it to the previous dispute because that's not relevant to their performance issues now. If they want to discuss the other issue then that might be fine if it helps to clear the air but you need to make the point that what happened in a dispute before is not relevant to their performance in the future. 

I don't think it's a big problem that someone would reply to you in the same manner that you initially reached out to them. You asked a one-line question that could essentially be replied to with a one-line answer and that is what you got. There is quite a lot of talk about being aware of cues from prospective employers and matching responses to the questions asked, and that is what this candidate has given you. The lack of a salutation might be concerning (but as Magisch points out, could mean their automated sig has just failed) but not really important. 

Don't be rude of course, but don't let your need to feel like you're being tactful lead you to dancing around the point you're trying to make. Talking about compensation packages is a perfectly normal part of the day to a hiring manager/HR person and regardless of whether or not they agree to your requests a normal, well balanced HR person working for a normal, well balanced company is not going to think anything bad about you for countering their offer. I think therefore that the answer is to be straightforward: 

The answer is still to escalate the problem to your manager. They need to address this issue by speaking to their manager. It should be possible to build a case that x didn't get done or was done badly, or that y went over-budget due to repeated failures of the IT function. 

When responding to a job application, I feel that you should follow the job application process outlined in the advert. Clearly that doesn't apply for cold-calling (though applying to a link on a job portal isn't cold-calling, as Kate notes). However, the principle behind that does; one of the reasons you follow the process when applying for an advertised job is because hiring managers are busy doing other things and wish to manage their time, e.g. to respond to your queries when its convenient for them. Emailing them rather than calling allows them to do the same thing and this is therefore what I'd recommend as a second choice to following the actual instructions on any actual job post, if you have one. You don't want potential employers to remember you as a pain in the backside. 

It's quite possible for a job offer to be withdrawn at this stage, yes. Imagine a company that makes an offer in good faith, but then goes bankrupt or undergoes a massive restructuring program that makes the position redundant. Or for that matter, offers might be made subject to a good reference, and then obviously might be withdrawn if instead, the references they receive are poor. Equally, from the company's point of view, they may be expecting you to start but you could win the lottery or get hit by a bus. There are always risks, no matter what.
