The study of the Deligne-Mumford compactification of Riemann surfaces with boundary can be reduced to the study of the Deligne-Mumford compactification of closed Riemann surfaces together with the study of separating antiholomorphic involutions on them. More precisely, the data of a compact Riemann surface A with (nonempty) boundary can be recovered from its double S=double(A) (a closed Riemann surface), the natural antiholomorphic involution $\iota$ on $S$ and the choice of one connected component C of $S\setminus Fix(\iota)$. Thus Isomorphism classes of compact Riemann surfaces A of a given type are naturally identified with Isomorphism classes of triples $(S,\iota,C)$ (for a separating antiholomorphic involution $\iota$) such that C is of the same topological type as A. In your specific case, the doubles are tori. As Riemann surfaces these doubles can only degenerate in one way, but there are two distinct isomorphism types of involutions on the limit: In one case the fixed point set of the involution has a component consisting of the node and a circle disjoint from the node; in the other case the fixed point set consists of two circles, both passing through the node, but otherwise disjoint. The first case gives rise to a disk with an interior puncture, the second to a disk, meeting with two punctures on the boundary, which form together a boundary node. If the conformal modulus of the annulus A goes to zero (i.e. $R\rightarrow 0$, the latter case), then the geodesic contracting is simply obtained by doubling a segment joining the two boundary components of $A$. 

It really depends on your applications/goals, and the graphs you consider. Do you want to compare graph sequences or graphs of a fixed size? First let's consider sequences. The problem with property testing invariants is that they are trivial for any non-dense class of graphs (including the Watts-Strogatz and Barabasi-Albert models). In other words, $\mathcal{G}_i \rightarrow W_0$ for any graph sequences with $o(n^2)$ edges, where $W_0$ is the empty graphon. The close equivalent of such properties for sparse-graphs is the distribution of neighborhoods, which gives the framework of local weak convergence. You can also look at the degree-degree correlations(Joint-Degree Distribution), or correlations for more vertices, but it becomes computationally expensive. There are some invariants that work for any class of graph, such as the class of first-order definable properties, or connectivity, hamiltonicity, etc, but either they are a bit too simple (FO-properties) or they lack a proper way to be treated uniformly. There are many other less known invariants, either in the social network community (Between-ness, Elite/Rich club or community analysis) or in the theoretical world (a good place to start is [1]). Here the keyword is "graph metrics". If you are not interested in asymptotic analysis, you can pretty much use anything, including a mix of algorithms for sparse graphs and algorithms for dense graphs. With some applications in mind, you can also use the result/statistics of some algorithms as invariants (e.g. some routing algorithms). In that case rigorous mathematical may be out of the question, but it may be much more useful in practice [2][3]. [1] Bollobás, Riordan "Sparse graphs: metrics and random models."

The following relies on the answer of Anton Petrunin and his explanations. Set $X:=\cap_{n\geq 1} f^n(M)$. Claim 0: Each $x\in X$ is a limit point of a sequence $f^n(y)$ for some $y\in M$. Moreover, if $x\in X\cap M^\circ$, then $y$ can be chosen in $M^\circ$. Proof of Claim 0: Assume $x\in X$. Then $x=f^n(y_n)$ for some $y_n\in M$ and each $n\geq 1$. After passing to a subsequence, we may assume that $y_{n_l}\rightarrow y$. Fix $\varepsilon>0$ and $K\geq 1$; we show that for some $k\geq K$, $f^k(y)\in B_\varepsilon(x)$. Choose $l\geq 1$, such that $k:=n_l\geq K$ and $y_{k}\in B_\varepsilon(y)$. Then, since $f$ is distance non-increasing, $dist(f^k(y),f^k(y_k))\leq dist(y,y_k)<\varepsilon$. The 'moreover' statement follows, since we can replace $y$ by $f^{k_0}(y)$, and choose $k_0$ such that $f^{k_0}(y)\in M^\circ$; the latter is possible, since a subsequence of $f^n(y)$ converges to $x\in M^\circ$. Claim 1: For any $x\in M^\circ$ and $r>0$ such that $B_r(x)\subset M^\circ$ and $n\geq 1$, we have $f^n(B_r(x))=B_r(f^n(x))$. We defer a proof of Claim 1 to the end. Claim 2: $X^\circ$ is nonempty, indeed it coincides with the set of all limit points of sequences $f^n(y)$ for $y\in M^\circ$. Proof Claim 2: By Claim 0, each $x\in X\cap M^\circ \supset X^\circ$ is such a limit point. Conversely, if $x$ is such a limit point, then $x\in B_r(f^k(y))=f^k(B_r(y))\subset f^k(M)$ for (certain) arbitrary large $k$; here we choose $r$ such that $B_r(y)\in M^\circ$ and use Claim 1. Therefore $x\in X=\cap_{n\geq 1} f^n(M)$, since the intersection is decreasing. Actually the same argument shows, that $B_s(x)\subset X$ for each $s<r$ (or also $s\leq r$). As a consequence $x\in X^\circ$. Claim 3: $X\cap M^\circ$ is open in $M^\circ$. (Clearly it is also closed, as $M$ is compact and nonempty by Claim 2). Proof Claim 3: Combining Claim 1 and 2, we see that $X\cap M^\circ=X^\circ=X^\circ \cap M^\circ$ is open in $M^\circ$. As $M^\circ$ is connected, Claim 3 implies: Claim 4: $X\cap M^\circ=M^\circ$. Since $X\subset M$ is closed, it follows that $X=M$, and thus $f(M)=M$. Conclusion:Claim 4 implies that $f$ is a distance preserving homeomorphism by Całka, Corollary 3.5 and Corollary 4.4. In particular, $f(\partial M)=\partial M$. A (standard) proof of Claim 1: First assume n=1: Since $f$ is $1$-Lipschitz, we have $f(B_r(x))\subset B_r(f(x))$ for any $x\in M^\circ$. To show equality, let $y\in B_r(f(x))$ arbitrary. There exists a path (of constant speed) $\gamma:[0,1]\rightarrow M^\circ$ of length $<r$ with $\gamma(0)=f(x)$ and $\gamma(1)=y$. There exists a unique lifting of $\gamma$, i.e. a path $\eta:[0,1]\rightarrow M^\circ$ with $f\circ \eta=\gamma$ and $\eta(0)=x$. (The set $T\subset [0,1]$ of $t$'s for which there is a unique lifting of $\gamma$ on the intervall $[0,t]$ contains $0$. $T$ is open since $f$ is a local diffeomorphism on $M^\circ$. In addition, $T$ is closed: If $t_k\in T$ converges to $t\in [0,1]$, then there is a unique lift $\eta_0$ of $\gamma$ on $[0,t)$. Since $M$ is compact and $\eta_0$ is Lipschitz, we can extend it to a path $\eta_1:[0,t]\rightarrow M$, and we have automatically $f(\eta_1(s))=\gamma(s)$ for $s\in [0,t]$. Since $length(\eta_1)=length(\gamma\vert_{[0,t]})<r$ as $f$ is an infinitesimal isometry, we have $\eta_1(t)\in B_r(x)\subset M^\circ$ and therefore $t\in T$, as desired.) Since $f$ is an (infinitesimal) isometry, length($\eta$)=length$(\gamma)<r$ and thus $\eta(1)\in B_r(x)$. Therefore $y=f(\eta(1))\in f(B_r(x))$, as claimed for $n=1$. For arbitrary $n\geq 2$, note that $f^{n-1}(B_r(x))=B_r(f^{n-1}(x))$ by induction. The domain invariance theorem (applied locally to $f^{n-1}$) implies that $f^{n-1}(M^\circ)\subset M^\circ$; hence if $B_r(x)\in M^\circ$, then so is $f^{n-1}(B_r(x))$. Applying Claim 1 for $n=1$ to the ball $B_r(f^{n-1}(y))$ yields Claim 1 for $n$. 

My question is from Cazenave's book "Semilinear Schrödinger Equation", page 35. I am stuck with Step 2 of the Strichartz's estimates. The book says that $||\Phi_f(t)||_{L^2}^2=\left(\int_0^t \mathcal{T}(t-s)f(s)ds,\int_0^t \mathcal{T}(t-\sigma)f(\sigma)d\sigma\right)_{L^2}=$ $\underbrace{\int_0^t\int_0^t\left( \mathcal{T}(t-s)f(s), \mathcal{T}(t-\sigma)f(\sigma)\right)_{L^2}d\sigma ds=\int_0^t \int_0^t \left( f(s),\mathcal{T}(s-\sigma)f(\sigma)\right)_{L^2}d\sigma ds=}_?$ $=\int_0^t\left(f(s),\Theta_{t,f}(s)\right)_{L^2}ds$, where $\Theta_{t,f}(s)$ was defined earlier in the chapter, but it is not important for the purpose of this question. $\mathcal{T}(t)$ is defined as the group of isometries on $L^2(\Omega)$ generated by the skew-adjoint operator $iA$, where $A$ is the Laplacian with the Dirichlet boundary conditions on $\partial\Omega$. On the other hand there is a theorem which says that $\mathcal{T}(t)\phi(x)=(4\pi it)^{-\frac{N}{2}}\int_{\mathbb{R}^N}e^\frac{i|x-y|^2}{4t}\phi(y)dy$ for suitable functions $\phi$. I would really appreciate if someone could give me a hand. I actually struggle with the third equality, namely how the identity below is determined: $\int_{0}^{t}\int_{0}^{t} (\mathcal{T}(t-s)f(s),\mathcal{T}(t-\sigma)f(\sigma))_{L^2} d\sigma ds=\int_{0}^{t}\int_{0}^{t} (f(s),\mathcal{T}(s-\sigma)f(\sigma))_{L^2} d\sigma ds$. If I am not wrong, I need to prove that $\int\mathcal{T}(t-s)f(s)\overline{\mathcal{T}(t-\sigma)f(\sigma)}=\int f(s)\overline{\mathcal{T}(s-\sigma)f(\sigma)}$, where the $L^2$ inner product is defined by $(u,v)_{L^2}$=Re $\int_{\Omega}u(x)\overline{v(x)}dx$. Thanks in advance! 

So first, let's get a few problems out of the way, using that the intersection number is the smallest number of cliques needed to cover all edges of the graph. For all $n$, $i(K_n) = 1$. Next, we have $(*)$: $\exists n$ such that $G \times H = K_n$ is equivalent to $\exists n_g n_h$ such that $G = K_{n_g}$ and $H = K_{n_h}$ (by definition of the tensor product). Now we can say $(**)$: if $G = \cup_i K_{n_i}$ and $H = \cup_j K_{n_j}$ then $i(G \times H) = i(G) \cdot i(H)$. Claim: for any pair of graphs $G$, $H$, $i(G \times H) = i(G) \cdot i(H)$. To get a clique-covering of size $i(G) \cdot i(H)$, we just use the coverings of $G$ and $H$, as in $(**)$. We can prove that there is no smaller covering by contradiction. Suppose that there is a clique covering of $G \times H$ with $i(G \times H) < i(G) \cdot i(H)$. Then by $(*)$, we get a clique covering of (wlog) $G$ of size less than $i(G)$, contradicting the minimality of the covering of $G$. 

Question 2: Yes, there are conformal metrics on a divergent sequence of tori with Area=1 and bounded diameter: Cutting the torus open along an embedded essential curve, you obtain a cylinder, conformally equivalent to $[0,R] \times S^1$. The fact that the sequence of conformal structures diverges, means that we can choose the cutting curve such that $R_n\rightarrow \infty$. However this is not really relevant here and we just directly construct such a conformal metric for any such cylinder (which gives rise to a conformal metric on the torus). Note that any conformal metric on such a standard cylinder has the form $h|dz|^2$. If $R\leq 5$ choose just any function $1\leq h\leq 2$ which glues nicely back to a metric on the torus; up to rescaling we obtain conformal metric of area 1 and bounded diameter. If $R\geq 5$, choose $h\leq 2$ everywhere and $h\geq 1$ on a neighborhood $[0,1]\times S^1 \cup [R-1,R]\times S^1$ of the boundary (and such that it glues nicely) and arbitrary small away from the boundary, say $h=1/R^2$ on $[2,R-2]\times S^1$. Up to rescaling by a factor in $[1,10]$, we can ensure that the area is 1 and clearly the diameter is bounded. Question 3: The argument of Thomas Richard shows you can embed any cylinder of the form $[0,R)\times S^1$ for $R\in (0,\infty]$ into any torus. The cylinder $\mathbb{R}\times S^1$ cannot be embedded into any compact Riemann surface $S\neq S^2$, since it would extend to an embedding of $S^2$. On the other hand, covering maps give immersions from $\mathbb{R}\times S^1$ into any torus (but no such immersions exist into surfaces of hyperbolic type). If the embedding is supposed to be $\pi_1$-injective, then the maximal $R$ such that $(0,R)\times S^1$ embeds into a complex torus $(T^2,j)$ is determined by the length $l_j$ of the systole of the torus in the conformal class determined by $j$. Indeed one can see that the maximal $R$ satisfies $R=1/l_j^2$. 

It boils down to creativity. What we truly admire in mathematical achievements are the creative leaps when creating new theories (category theory, calculus), not mathematical prowess, which is a tool. Good problem solving is also highly regarded, but it's also admired for the creative ideas it takes while doing the proof. Computers are terrible at creativity, but insanely better than humans at raw computational power. We don't even have what can barely sounds like a mathematical model for creativity. When people thought computers could not beat people at chess, it was because they assumed it was a task that required creativity, and could not be done with only raw computational power, fine-tuned heuristics, and good interpolation from known results (in most games, this move fails, so it's probably a bad move). It's basically the Chinese room Gedankenexperiment all over again: you don't need to understand Chinese to form valid Chinese sentences given that you have a good enough grasp of the syntactic game. Gowers said in a talk that at least 90% of a mathematican's work is routine, and could very well be automated. This is exactly the same thing, to make most proofs you apply some heuristics, a few classical theorems and techniques. There's no reason to think that this could not be fully automated for a wide range of problems, given enough time. Now for mathematics, if humans were working at the low-level of axiomatic set theory, then they would have been out-competed by computers long ago. But the fact is that humans (at least, some) can work in inconsistent high-level systems, and fix the problems as they arise because they have a good intuition of what should work (take set theory, lambda-calculus, etc). Beating a human at go is the same kind of work that had been done on chess, so the misunderstanding was just on the true nature of what 'being good at chess/go/X' means, and in particular what it means computationally. We're getting a better idea on these thanks to the advances in proof theory, but that doesn't help with the question of creativity. Note that most 'creative work' can also be reduced to a short set of generic techniques (blending two ideas, changing a parameter, etc), but it doesn't really help getting to the next scientific revolution. To come back at the issue at hand, the problem is not only finding proofs in mathematics; if you were to run an excellent algorithm that would give you tons of theorems, you would be well-embarassed in finding which ones are useful, and which ones are very convoluted tautologies with little content. Computers can be much better than humans at some mathematical tasks (like we know from a while that they are orders of magnitude better at arithmetic than humans), they are already much better at specific theorem-proving tasks, and the number of such tasks will continue to grow. This doesn't address the creative advantage humans have. 

In Cazenave's Semilinear Schrödinger Equation, page 56, he describes derivation of conservation of charge and energy of the equation $iu_t+\Delta u+|u|u=0$, ($\alpha=\lambda=1$ and $n=3$, if referring to the book), where $u$ must be a function, which decays rapidly at infinity. 1) Conservation of charge Multiply the equation by $\bar{u}$, integrate over $\mathbb R^3$ and take the imaginary part to obtain $\frac{d}{dt}\int_{\mathbb{R^n}}|u(t,x)|^2dx=0$. What I do is multiply both sides by $\bar{u}$ and get $i u_t \bar{u}+\bar{u}\Delta u+ |u|^3=0$. Now taking the complex conjugate yields $-i \bar{u}_t u+u\Delta \bar{u}+ |u|^3=0$. And subtracting the second equation from the first one we obtain $i(u_t \bar{u}+\bar{u}_t u)+\bar{u}\Delta u-u\Delta \bar{u}=0$, which is equivalent to $i\frac{d}{dt}(u\bar{u})+\bar{u}\Delta u-\overline{\bar{u}\Delta u}=0$ and thus to $i\frac{d}{dt}|u|^2+ 2i\mathbf{Im}(\bar{u}\Delta u)=0$. This, however, indicates that the whole left part is imaginary, while we need the first term one only. $\underline{\mathbf{Question:}}$ Is this correct and is it here the moment when $\bar{u}\Delta u-u\Delta \bar{u}$ should be integrated over $\mathbb{R}^3$ and e.g. and Divergence Theorem used? 2) Conservation of energy Multiply the equation by $\bar{u}_t$, integrate over $\mathbb{R}^3$, take the real part and obtain $\frac{d}{dt}\int_{\mathbb{R}^3}(\frac{1}{2}|\nabla u|^2-\frac{1}{3}|u|^3)dx=0$. Multiplying the equation by $\bar{u}_t$, then taking the complex conjugate and summing up the two equations leads to $\nabla\cdot (\bar{u}_t\nabla u+u_t\nabla\bar{u})-\frac{d}{dt}|\nabla u|^2+|u|\frac{d}{dt}|u|^2=0$. This is equivalent to $\nabla\cdot \mathbf{Re}(\bar{u}_t\nabla u)-\frac{d}{dt}|\nabla u|^2+\frac{2}{3}\frac{d}{dt}|u|^3=0$. Again everything on the left side is real and we need to get rid of $\nabla\cdot \mathbf{Re}(\bar{u}_t\nabla u)$. $\underline{\mathbf{Question:}}$ Is the above reasoning correct and is it here the moment when $\nabla\cdot \mathbf{Re}(\bar{u}_t\nabla u)$ should be integrated over $\mathbb{R}^3$ and e.g. and Divergence Theorem used? I would very much appreciate if someone tells me how to tackle this. I think it is not that difficult, but am stuck. Thanks everyone!
