Is this possible with Postfix, and does anyone have documentation on how to do it? I know just enough Linux to be dangerous, so I want to be sure before I suggest this. 

The short answer is yes, that's the level of performance you should expect to see from the H200. The long answer: The H200 is the old SAS 6iR with SATA 6Gb/s support. It doesn't have the usual features you'd see on a RAID card (battery backup unit, onboard caching, RAID5/6 support). The cache determines how fast your RAID array is (along w/ the # of spindles and type of drive), so no cache = slow performance. Add the 7200RPM SATA drives (which are slow compared to a 10-15k RPM SAS drive) and that's the level of performance you can expect. 

We monitor our Dell ESXi servers using OpenManage Server Administrator. This will give you hardware info inside ESXi and setup an OpenManage node you can connect to for more hardware and array info. Instructions are here: $URL$ They work for ESXi 4.1. ESXi 5.0 requires a newer version of the OpenManage VIB and Managed Node. 

I've recently been in a situation where an Exchange email server went down and we weren't able to bring it back online after 48hrs, so some incoming emails bounced. Also, users weren't able to send or receive emails for a few days, which was a sore point and caused some early withdrawl symptoms. In a post-mortum someone came up with the idea of setting up a quick and dirty webmail server to catch those emails during the outage so that at the very least people could receive and send emails. I've never done this, but it sounds like a good idea. Has anyone tried something like this before successfully? 

Are you trying to input audio or output audio with this sound card? If it's input, you can connect almost any USB microphone and Windows Server 2008 will recognize it as a USB recording device (no additional drivers needed). Even the Xbox 360 headset will be recognized.If it's output, you can purchase a USB DAC and convert digital files to analog. Here are some high end USB microphone vendors: Rode Podcaster $URL$ Samson C01U $URL$ USB DAC Vendor: $URL$ If you really need an internal sound card, your best bet is going to be one of those Creative or ASUS sound cards w/ Vista drivers. Very few vendors, if any, are going to pay the expense for official WHQL driver certification for Windows Server when the number of potential users is a few thousand at most. 

Is there a way to estimate how much space I would save by compressing a folder with NTFS compression without actually compressing the folder? This is on a Windows 2008 R2 server in case that makes a difference. 

We have a Windows 2008 server that we want to move offsite to the cloud (we're using Rackspace). It has to talk to our Active Directory domain constantly, so we need a stable site-to-site VPN between it and our datacenter. Rackspace doesn't offer a virtual VPN device, and a quick search shows that Cisco-Windows VPN tunnels don't work well, if it all. We do have a Windows 2008 server in our datacenter that the offsite server could connect to. What is the best way to get these two Windows 2008 servers to connect to each other? 

Forward emails sent to old_domain.com to new_domain.com Autoreply to the sender that everyone's email has changed to new_domain.com 

I am running into a problem while trying to save a transaction log database backup maintenance task: 

We have a vSphere cluster of 4 ESXi servers licensed for Standard. We want to purchase some Advanced licenses so that we can use the Fault Tolerance feature in vSphere, but we don't want to upgrade the entire cluster to Advanced if we don't have to (it's ridiculously expensive). Does anyone know if you can run Advanced features on just a few specific servers in a vSphere cluster without having to upgrade the entire cluster? 

I can select all databases, all user databases, specific databases...none of them ever save. Every time I re-open the task that field is switched back to < Select one or more > option. I've connected as user sa and I've connected with Windows Authentication. Same result. Also, I've double-checked that the databases I'm trying to backup are in Full recovery model. I'm running SQL Server 2005 SP2 on Windows 2003 R2 SP2. 

You may want to install ESXi on the host server instead of fighting VMware Server. I have installed VMware Server 2.0 for 4 different clients on Windows 2003 and Ubuntu 8.10 host OSes. The hardware was simliar to to yours in that we were using 7200RPM SATA drives on a PERC RAID controller. When we tried running SBS 2003 and Windows 2003 guests on it the IO performance was atrocious (in the sub 10MB/sec category). When we installed ESXi and migrated the guest OSes on it IO performance jumped to 90MB/sec and the results were much better. I don't know how flexible you can be with the OS on that server but you may end up saving much more time by just moving to ESXi. 

Add the 'Back Up Database Task' to the maintenance plan. Edit the task. Select backup type: 'Transaction Log'. Select any database running with Full Recovery Model. Close the task. Re-open the task. Notice that the database I selected is not checked anymore. 

We have a Dell Poweredge server running ESXi 4.1 U1 that was installed using Dell's customized ESXi ISO. Now we would like to upgrade to 4.1 U2 and upgrade any Dell specific bits that were installed. I downloaded the 4.1 U2 Dell Customized ISO and tried to install over the existing installation but it doesn't look like I can do that non-destructively. I tried upgrading using VMware's Update Manager, and that upgrades the ESXi installation, but I don't think it upgrades the Dell specific bits. 

We have several Windows VMs (all user editions, no server editions). We install virus scanners inside the VMs to protect them from users. The real-time file scanning kills I/O performance inside the VM though (I see disk access times spike to 2000ms while it runs). Multiply that by 50x and you get a lot of I/O churn. We can disable real-time file scanning, but that defeats the purpose of having it there in the first place. I think creating snapshots every few hours is a better solution, but I wanted to ask if anyone else has found a better solution for this. The virus scanner is Symantec Endpoint and the VMs are running on top of vSphere 4.1. 

It sounds like Cicso's virtual tunnel interfaces let you run dynamic routing protocols over IPSEC tunnels without GRE (see here). I was wondering if there was an equivalent in Juniper's JUNOS. I didn't see anything in JUNOS' documentation but I'm hoping someone here has used it and knows the same of the feature. 

You need to run adprep first to update the Active Directory schema to recognize a 2008 R2 DC. Look for adprep.exe on your 2008 R2 DVD and run the following commands on your 2003 DC: adprep /forestprep adprep /domainprep /gpprep adprep /rodcprep If your 2003 server is a 32bit server, run adprep32.exe instead. Also make sure you change your DNS settings on all of your server network adapters to point to the new DC before you demote the old one. EDIT: Remember to move all the FSMO roles to the new DC. Thanks tegbains! 

I've seen this happen with ESXi 4.1 hosts after a patch accidentally wacked the /tmp/scratch folder. You might want to check if that directory still exists on the hosts that exited maintenance mode automatically. If they're missing, you'll want to mkdir to create it. Also, you'll want to check if persistent scratch is setup correctly on each host by following this VMware KB article: VMware KB: Creating a persistent scratch location for ESXi 4.x and 5.x 

We are thinking about upgrading to SBS 2011. We would also like a way to collaborate with our external clients using Sharepoint Foundation, which is built into SBS 2011. Is this possible? I know in full Sharepoint you can publish client facing sites where you can share documents back and forth, but I wasn't sure if Sharepoint Foundation could do this. 

First things first: SPF only specifies what servers will send outgoing emails from your domain. I came up with this record: v=spf1 a mx ip4:1.1.1.1 include:_spf.google.com include:emailpublishers.com ~all Definition: a and mx: allow your domain's @ A record and MX servers to send email. This covers your domain's @ A record and all of your MX records (may be a little redundant in this case but doesn't hurt). ip4:1.1.1.1: the ip address should be auxiliary.com's outgoing email server ip addresses. you may have to add several of these but this allows auxiliary.com to send emails on your behalf include:_spf.google.com: this allows google apps to send email for main.com (this is why the mx tag above may be redundant since main.com's mx records are google apps) include:emailpublishers.com: you'll want to ask emailpublishers.com what SPF to use for this one but I imagine it's similar. If they have one, replace this one with theirs. ~all: softfail any emails from main.com that come from servers not listed in this record. This tells spam filters to use SPF as one of the criteria to flag an email as spam. using a -all is a hardfail, which means anything the SPF record doesn't catch is spam. This can lead to false positives though. (edit) Once you're done, test it out by sending emails to a Gmail account. Gmail logs in the headers whether the email passed a SPF check. It's incredibly useful for testing. (edit 2) The 'a' in the SPF record only allows your domain's @ A record to send mail, not all of your A records. E.g. example.org with the SPF record v=spf1 a ~all would allow example.org to send mail, but not beta.example.org or testing.example.org. Fixed it above. 

Grasping at straws here, but what NICs are you using in these servers? The Stack Overflow sysadmins have had weird networking issues with Broadcom NICs that went away when they switched to Intel NICs: $URL$ 

Sure, you can always connect a machine directly to the internet and have a software firewall running on it (Windows Firewall for Windows, iptables for Linux)..:) 

Do I need the Backup Exec 2010 VMware Agent plus the Exchange Agent to backup an Exchange VM? Or will the VMware Agent take care of it (minus any granular recovery features; we're looking for disaster recovery options only at the moment)? (It shouldn't be this hard to figure out an answer to this from Symantec's docs, but I can't get a straight answer) 

Windows and Exchange updates always require reboots to finish installing, so that's part of it. With good planning and proper setup (load balancers and clustering) you can maintain 24x7 uptime so that email is always available on one server. On the client side though, there's always a brief outage (5-30sec) as Outlook figures out the CAS server it's connected to is offline and Autodiscover switches it to another. Usually you get the "The Exchange Administrator has made a change that requires you to restart Outlook" message when this happens. It's not a long outage, but it counts as an outage, so that's why you need to schedule maintenance time to do it. There's also the chance of something going wrong during the maintenance period, so to CYA you need to schedule it. EDIT: So I found out if you put a load balancer in front of your CAS servers you won't get the "The Exchange Administrator has made a change..." message in Outlook. You'll still have a brief outage as the load balancer switches you to an active CAS server. 

A single IP address will force you to host these services on non-standard ports if they both use the same port by default. For example, if your video conferencing software and web server both want to use port 80 for HTTP and you need to have both accessible publicly, you'll have to set one to run on port 80 and the other to a different port (like 8080). 

We have a 3U Supermicro chassis with 16 bays on a SAS expander backplane. We have 15 of the bays occupied with hard drives at the moment. We would like to add two more drives to the backplane, but we only have 1 bay open. Does anyone know if there is a way to “add” more SAS ports to our backplane? EDIT: More details! We have this motherboard which comes with an onboard SAS HBA: $URL$ inside this chassis: $URL$ I'm pretty sure this server uses the same chassis: $URL$ If you go through the configuration page for that server, you can add 16 HDs + 2 SAS SSDs. That means they're filling up all of the bays and connecting 2 SAS drives internally. The chassis comes with brackets to hold the SSDs but I don't know where they would plug into the motherboard or the backplane. The motherboard SAS connectors are both plugged into the backplane. 

Our company just switched to a new email domain and wants to keep the old domain around for a year as they notify everyone about the change. The old email domain was on Exchange 2007 and the new email domain is on Google Apps. Everyone is 100% on Google Apps, and the Exchange server just forwards on emails. I would like to replace the Exchange server (it's underpowered and a waste of resources just forwarding emails) with something lightweight, based around Postfix or another email server. It needs to do the following: 

Are you connecting the X25-M SSD to the backplane? There's a known issue with Nexenta and accessing the L2ARC over a backplane. Your best bet is to connect the SSD directly into a SATA port on the motherboard. Make sure it's configured to use AHCI as well. If you're running anything mission critical on this server I would switch to a SLC SSD (like the X25-E or a STEC SSD). That being said, you'll probably be ok with the X25-M if it's not. 

We have a new office that was punched down with Ethernet in every office and every cubicle. The electrician didn't mark the ports on the patch panel or the wall ports, so I don't know where say port 1 on the patch panel goes in the office. I've heard of people using a tone generator to figure out where the cables are but I'm not sure what that entails. I was also thinking of looking up ARP entries on our switches to find out what port is getting what MAC address and then cross referencing it with a list of MAC addresses on all of the PCs in the office. This sounds unreliable though. Is there a quick and easy way to label these ports?
