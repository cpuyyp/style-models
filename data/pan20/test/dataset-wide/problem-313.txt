It is plausible to believe that the Aztec Empire could have shifted toward an expansionist policy of conquering its neighbors had the Spanish not shown up in the new world. (There are some issues with the how in your explanation but the premise is otherwise fine/interesting). As an example it took the Roman Empire something like 600 years to complete its conquests. The Aztec Empire only lasted around 100 years. Without European pressure it is possible they could have expanded significantly. It would likely have been slower going at first for geographical (jungle is hard to conquer) and technological reasons (transportation and logistics and communication) but it is entirely plausible. It should be noted that once out of the jungle conquests could have become much more rapid as armies on the move fare much better in farmland and plains for both reasons of movement and food. To finally directly address your point... No. Not because the Aztecs couldn't have moved north, but because the First Nations are Canadian Tribal peoples. The odds of the Aztecs making it that far north with their style of military organization is just not feasible. Odds are they would make it into central or even possibly northern portions of Mexico but it doesn't pass the sanity test for them to move much beyond that. 

Regular, if not almost constant rain. Its possible that this environment was selectively chosen (considering they are floating around in a gas giant) and the choice would not be made without access to the things you need to survive. 

Another example would be and Engineer dealing with say ventilation systems. This person would fall into the Technician role. Though you could have a lead role here as well. 

So in my world I have a variety of nations states ranging from independent city-states to empires. I am in the process of defining the socio-political landscape of the world and have a few story centric international relationships that are partially defined. For the rest of the world and to provide more detail on those things that are already defined I am looking for a way to define (essentially give each a score) the power of each independent political entity. 

A cat's body type won't really support full blown antlers like you see on a deer. The deer and its relatives have a much more upright neck and head while a cat's head and neck tend to mostly stay on the same plane as the spine. This would make them very front heavy and while it might be entertaining to see that struggle (and feel bad about being entertained...) that wouldn't last the evolutionary process even if it formed in the first place. I can however imagine a cat with horns more similar to a buffalo/cow. Shorter, sharper, potentially used for hunting large prey or of course attracting mates. 

In short: Sapience requires specialized members of the whole to transfer and process information. So I am pretty sure you at least need one of these. (and I am not talking about NPH but that probably wouldn't hurt either) 

You don't have to weaken armor to decorate it. First, gems are never going to make plate or other metal armors better at their job. 

So living in Nebraska and living near the Missouri river I can tell you it was A LOT of water. Towns were flooded, farms were washed away roads were destroyed...plenty of damage to lives property and infrastructure. So...this is complicated for a couple reasons. 

The square-cubed law is a big problem, and makes this creature impossible. But another problem exists and that is the fact that this is a hybrid. Not only is this creature a hybrid, but it is a hybrid of two creatures drastically removed from each other on the evolutionary tree. Take a look at this. 

Rather than list off examples from history I am going to give you a rundown of things to consider when gauging size. 

So far as I am aware all venom is created in glands and generally derive from enzymes that already exist for some practical function. A mutation of the code for one of these enzymes is usually the source of poison creation. This article is exceptionally helpful in explaining the evolution of venom. 

This should pretty well explain WHY a civilization would be emulated. The short version is they simplify the world, making it a more familiar place, in essence making the world smaller. The empire leaves lasting cultural (government or social) institutions, maybe libraries or councils or trade groups, the empire leaves art and architecture that require generations of skill development (several lifetimes of student - teacher - student - teacher growth in knowledge to accomplish), and the current people must believe that the past glory days are something worth returning to. 

This one is actually pretty easy to answer. Egypt's #1 ally outside of the Middle East (and plausible #1 overall) is the United States. This takes the form of large amounts of economic and military aid. Egyptian military officers are trained by the US military in the US (I actually had a few in my classes when I was in training). If your future Egypt can keep the US on its side, or at least be patient enough for the US to get completely fed up with the UN you are good to go. The US is the linchpin that holds the UN together and without US support its effectiveness (which in my opinion is often suspect anyway, though...you're working with the whole world so its bound to be complicated) would diminish to the point where it would be little more than a puppet show. According to the UN website the US provides 28.38% of the peace keeping budget. If that goes away (not to mention the US military forces that support the UN) the ability of the organization to do much more than chastise you is severely diminished. More broadly the US is the largest donor to the UN generally. (This data is somewhat dated, but still illustrative) The US donated 6 Billion dollars more to the UN 2002, 2003 and 2004 than the second place nation (Japan) The gap between the US and Japan is MORE than Japan gave in total (5.5 billion). The total three year tally for the US was $11,398,068,755. The short version: The US stops giving money to the UN. 

If you are looking for a catlike stalking creature you have to go paw. Hooves are loud and not generally great on rough terrain nor are they good for turning in a chase for prey. Hooves are great for all out running, but paws are the way to go for agility, if this animal is a hunter, paws are the way to go. Keep in mind the feet are not simply for running but also for bringing down prey (in most cases). 

Among birds in particular plumage is a primary sources of mate selection. Peacocks, Flamingos, and many others. 

Being prior Air Force I have a literal out of the book answer for you. If anything seems confusing just ask, I can elaborate. So I will do this in two parts, (after some comments) first the basics, these are the general principles by which Air power should be used, and second creatures (like varying aircraft) have different strengths and weaknesses so we can go into that. 

That being said many stone buildings were still intact, and archeologists found Textiles, Basketry, Stone, Bone, Shell, Ceramics, Wood, Copal, Rubber, other Organic Materials, and Mammalian Remains. 

Well I see your problem. You want power to reside in more than one person/group. The crux of the issue is that you want democracy, where (ostensibly) the power lies with the people and their vote. Conversely, and simultaneously you want a king and lords that have absolute power over their domains. Power can't truly exist in both places...unless it can...nope never mind it can't. Here are some ideas that come to mind that might get you close to where you want to be. 

Create a geographical world complete with map. Define a history based on that world. There is no step three. 

So in short it can be done, but you will have to work it out really well to make it not seem contrived. 

For a good look at the mating dances check this out. If this is the reasoning you choose a couple things to keep in mind. Many of these birds also develop intricate dances for courting and some collect and create a nest...or stage so to speak. Including these facets could make for a really interesting creature. How would it evolve: Well...that's tougher. A single tail has obvious advantages for mobility and balance...more would be less useful and overly biologically complicated. Random mutation and selection is the only plausible if not overly realistic scenario. 

YES Polytheism is alive and well in the world today so the question "Would modern civilization embrace a polytheistic cult?" (I read cult = religion here) is a moot point. Yes, as a matter of fact they would. Hinduism is a polytheistic religion in the extreme there are hundreds of gods. There are also concepts in philosophies like Shintoism that one could argue make them polytheistic. In the end the drive toward any religion is a person seeking a framework for helping them navigate life. I won't comment on which kinds of religions make the most sense or are "right", in my mind they all serve the same fundamental function and that is what is relevant to this question. Should a "new" or "consolidated" polytheistic religion touch the right chord with humanity it could succeed as well as anything else. I actually feel it likely that at some point the main monotheistic religions on earth will blend together, whether that is in the form of a pantheon or a single super god amounts to about the same. 

In short...modern technology and the spread of information and knowledge limits the value of experts in day to day life. Even in the sciences, even in biology, even in micro-biology, even in bacterial enzyme identification and manipulation there are dozens, if not hundreds or thousands of experts 

To truly dominate you would need to cover all of these aspects. You need a monopoly (or near monopoly) on the use of force. You need to oversee/control the levers of industry and finance. You need to be the top of the diplomatic pile, this is the soft skills portion where influence plays a huge role, can you diplomatically solve problems or get others in line? Finally information...this is touchy in the modern era obviously what with the potential impacts to personal freedom but information goes well beyond just personal data. Permanence: Nothing lasts forever but you could find ways to make a world government stick for varying lengths of time. 

Notes: This is a pretty fundamental change to how the world works. Removing or minimizing the relevance of heavenly bodies in the day to day life of early humanity could cause things to develop radically differently. In the end I don't think you will see technologies that fail to come to be. The timing of them showing up will surely change as will, by necessity, the order in which they are created. Very interesting concept and one that allows you to tweak the world to your heart's content. Just try to maintain a logical consistency, and if you are unsure whether two developments fit into the world you are creating those would be great questions for the site. 

Eventually the lord could wall the surrounding city as well. This gives you another tax base (the local population) from which to pull funds for castle building. (oooh I added docks to the picture!) 

Now, given that you can come up with a reason for there to be complex, intelligent life on this world here is how I would see things happening. Tech stages would essentially be similar to ours with a few additional requirements of course. 

There are other methods to achieve what you are discussing but these are common enough to be well known and believable. I would generally suggest that a combination of two or three of the above makes a more believable scenario but it is not necessary. 

At this point you have geography, roads, city flavor and style, relevant sections of town and you can simply fill in the details at your leisure. Keep in mind older cities tend to follow geography while newer ones tend to grid things out. 

So. What happens in these off years, when voter turnout is significantly lower? Well voting in off years tends to be more conservative as older voters are more likely to cast a vote all the time. So a few notes on your scenario. The lower the voter turnout the easier it is for some group not in the majority or carrying a majority sentiment on a particular issue to take power. If literally everyone the government as was ceases to be. You cannot have an elected democratic government if no one votes...I have trouble comprehending a situation where literally no one votes...maybe it could dwindle over time... I suppose the most likely scenarios would be either 

I think the answer here is both. First they would resist, then embrace. First they would fight against technological change. The most prominent reason that a cultural or racial group rejects technology is that it threatens their way of life and there is generally backlash at the source of the threat. This can come from a variety of sources. 

History The sleigh and reindeer are remnants from a time long past when Santa did things on his own in the more traditional manner. When Christmas was a small event in a fairly geographically localized area he did in fact fly around and drop off presents via a genetically modified elk powered sleigh. Over time as things grew Santa learned to hone his powers and he was able to skip the travel time altogether, but humanity had become so entranced with the myth of the sleigh with silver bells and reindeer that to this day he keeps up the charade by providing each of his avatars with reindeer and sleighs. Rumor has it the fleet of sleighs numbers in the thousands. 

These are somewhat combine but religion race and culture are common concepts that leaders can use to motivate the masses. Its a simple matter of them versus us and nothing motivates the uneducated masses faster than threats to their way of life...even if that means hating another person's way of life...which is so painfully ironic. It is not simply education, though the best counter to the vile idiocy out there is certainly to teach. 

Things would certainly be different in many ways, but in others they would stay much the same and I think that is a reflection of old versus new. Building new infrastructure is one thing. New infrastructure is expensive to be sure, but it is far more expensive to update existing infrastructure. Old Cities Old cities can be broken down into (at least) two parts. Cities we consider old today, and the modern cities of today. When I speak of old cities today I mean places like Athens, Istanbul and the other truly ancient cities. These cities (at least the ancient portions) would likely change very little if at all. Which as a person who appreciates the old and its conservation is something I would whole heartedly agree with. Personal mobility would likely be the only significant change, having what amounts to a jetpack would make traversing the old cities much easier. Personal in home use (as you mentioned walking on ceilings) might change somewhat, perhaps allowing greater population density. Modern era cities would likely change significantly more but it would take a long time for that change to be uniform. As I mentioned updating infrastructure is time and cost intensive. In a similar vein to white flight odds are the well off would move out of major "old" cities to live in new neighborhoods that were completely integrated with the new technology and then the technology would work its way back into the cities New Cities As mentioned in the old cities section these new modern cities would see the most rapid change and be the most uniformly impacted places. This is your city of the future where the infrastructure and construction were designed with the new technology in mind. This is the simple bit...relative to updating old cities. Automation The more commonplace this 3D environment becomes the more automation will be necessary. Managing navigation in a crowded 3D space may well be impossible for humans to manage with any reasonable level of safety. Either you can go the self-driving vehicles connected to a massive program to control them route or you can go with the 2D routes just elevated. So similar to two level roads you could do the same for flying vehicles creating 'lanes' above the street at a fraction of the cost compared to building and maintaining roads. I am picturing a sort of metal frame that the vehicles would have to stay within. This would be complex to design effectively...LOTS of on and off ramps. Controls Either route you go you are going to have a controlling agency akin to the FAA. This is particularly relevant in the automated flying cars scenario but I think would be necessary either way. You would likely have to make elevation restrictions based on classes of mobility. For vehicles, express lanes above 100 feet, between 50-100 feet for going to a specific local location, and under 50 feet would be for personal mobility vehicles...i.e. "jet-packs" Density If you can get past the biological implications of being upside down...which is not a simple task you could drastically increase population density in city centers by allowing people to live on the ceiling. More practically and realistically it would make movement far more efficient making previously impossible routs available for transport.
