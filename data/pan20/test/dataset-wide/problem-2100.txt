And depending on your job you may want to hang a semi-casual business jacket and tie on the wall just in case, and have a pair of more formal shoes in a bag under your desk. 

And that's the problem right there. You didn't write to the listed specifications. You made assumptions about things you didn't have enough information about to make assumptions on. And if you decided to use floating point numbers to store monetary data, you made a fundamental mistake. 

In my experience wearing "less formal" clothes or footwear is rarely an issue, especially in positions without physical customer contact and certainly if there's a good reason for it (and having a foot or ankle so swollen that you simply don't fit in your regular shoes would certainly count as a good reason). 

Screens Screen brightness is a pretty rough thing in your eyes. Play with your screens, make sure that they only case as much light as they need to in order to be visible, and no more. A lot of folks prefer warmer colors as well. If your eyes are hurting, it may be worth it to consider trying some filtered glasses - The jury is still out on the long term benefits, but in the short term after eight hours in front of three monitors, my eyes don't hurt as much when wearing my pair. 

Catess, since you've only put your applications in, I'd recommend not actively persuing one at the detriment of persuit of another. At this early stage, it's great to consider which jobs you'd prefer, but since you haven't been contacted for any of them, it'd be in your favor to make sure and be attentive and respond to all possibilities with equal enthusiasm. The ball will be in your court once you have job offers to compare, but until then, make sure and keep up with any communication and diplomacy with all three possible employers. One thing to keep in mind is in this situation, even an interview does not constitute an offer. Just because you've had an interview with your dream employer, don't skip out on contact with the others until you have the job secured. 

So unless you're the person who creates the job ads for your company and you know for a fact that your company doesn't do this, there's no way of knowing the others "copied your job ad". 

I'd never consider such lines about them being casual about dress to apply to a job interview. You're there effectively as a sales person for a company trying to sell them pretty expensive services on a long term contract, dress the part. That means a suit, though no tie and maybe sneakers instead of loafers. Take a good quality shoulder bag instead of an attache case to carry your notes and other papers in. That way you give the impression of someone who's professional but knows he's visiting a place less insistent on formality than a bank. 

I'm being sent by my employer to a conference in another state. Having barely traveled of my own accord, I know nothing about how travel works, especially when (partially?) paid for by someone else. What questions should I ask my manager before I go? At this point, I don't know what I don't know. Things that may seem common place that I've never had to manage before 

This seems like something I would probably be informed of at my next eval, not a rather informal email from someone a couple levels of management above me (I'm thinking the subjects of the email were CC'd by mistake). Given the size of our company, formal changes in your position are always done with at least two members of management present. This wasn't CC'd to my direct lead (or Jim's, Joe's, or Bob's), so I'm hesitant to ask them about this, but I'm really not sure how to respond to this or if I should just ignore it until I'm told about it in a meeting. 

Your notice period doesn't start until you give notice, unless both parties (you and the company) agree to a shorter period. So no, you can't consider your notice period started until you have given notice according to the requirements set forth in your contract. 

in addition to what's already been said (iow it's none of your business if you don't already know how to handle it, and that's putting it mildly) you should not look at what people are receiving. IF, and only IF, it's your job to look at violations of corporate email policies you should look at what people are SENDING. What people are receiving is largely outside their influence, especially if you have a mail server where people can receive messages from outside the company. 

Talk to him, see why he's not calling in sick, and don't be paranoid about some bugs either. There are many diseases that are not infectious yet have you coughing all day long. Chronic stomach problems for example. 

So, I'm considering going out job hunting again, and I've read it's always good to have a portfolio of your work handy. Unfortunately, the results of my work are rather boring to most people (An JavaScript/html calendar similar to JQuery's day-picker, an active html analog clock, etc). Alternatively, I have side projects that are more interesting (an Arduino sketch for a player-guitar, an Arduino sketch for an led grid that simulates light patterns similar to what you'd find on the bottom of a pool under moving water), but less useful in the real world. I'm trying to not be too broad or make a question which only has subjective answers, but I'm also trying to understand what sort of code and projects a recruiter might be interested in. I feel like my utilitarian code is more useful in the real world, but my side projects show more of an aptitude and ability to problem solve. Which would a recruiter be more interested in? 

Quite simple. If you already have 10 applications running and are in the last stages of negotiating a potential contract, there's less opportunity there for them (and they'll have to take care to not send your resume to the companies you're already talking to or have talked to recently too of course). It's also a means to gauge how serious you are. 

Again: it doesn't matter if your ideas have merit. Your status means that they won't be perceived as having merit. And there's nothing you can do to change that by having an attitude about it, only time and gaining the respect of your colleagues as somebody who knows what he's talking about MAY do that. 

Maybe in your case the new system does add business value (and anyway, the rollout seems too far ahead to do anything about it if it doesn't). But keep in mind that the concerns of your users aren't automatically invalid because the user is older than you are. She may be set in her ways, but that may well mean that her way of doing things is the optimal way and the new system will degrade her (and everyone elses') job performance, and THAT is bad for business. 

You have to remember, there are a lot of things actually going on when you are at your office chair (or your bed with a laptop). Here are a few common aggrevations from office life, some I didn't even think of until they were pointed out to me. Keyboard 

So, I am the SME in one area, and a backup SME in an area that overlaps. I cover my coworker's (Let's call him John) area while he's on PTO, and he does mine. A few weeks ago, he came by to let me know that he would be leaving the company as a heads up, but asked me not to discuss it with anyone. I kept silent, assuming he would give a customary two weeks notice, at which point we could start planning a shift of responsibilities. His final day is a little over a week away, and we're getting to the point where I really should start talking to my manager to let him know my attention is going to be divided. While the two areas overlap, there is generally enough work to do in both that it will affect my performance trying to cover both areas, I would like to Inform my boss in advance so he can plan. The thing Is, I want to respect my coworkers wishes (he didn't need to tell me). I've asked him about it and he said "He'll let them know" but isn't telling me when. How can I approach this situation? Edit: As per Alroc's comment, dual coverage is a company standard to improve bus factor. Every person has a dedicated backup (most of the time it's a paired backup in two related areas, but sometimes not). Additionally, to my knowledge. I'm the only person he has told. I know explicitly that he has not told our team lead. 

Just think how uncomfortable those Chinese people would be if they visit your site and you take them to an organ concert in a church where they have to sit perfectly still and not say anything or even smile until they're out after 4 hours. When you're in a different culture on business, you'd best humour your business partners and go with the flow. Maybe some polite hints that you'd like to see other kind of entertainment might give them an opportunity to show you other things in their area, but don't put it bluntly or rudely as it's bad for business (and remember, when you're traveling on business you're in function as long as you're in company of business partners, even if it's on paper a social gathering). 

welcome to the real world. Happens all the time. Expect to get blamed for missing deadlines you warned were impossible before the project started. Expect to get blamed for architecture flaws imposed on you by others despite your warnings that you submitted in writing to management. Expect to get blamed for bugs that existed in the code before you even started working with the company. Expect to be blamed for hardware failures of the hardware running the software you're maintaining. (yes, I've had that happen too. Someone trips over a power cable, computer fails, and they blame our software for the computer turning off, our management blame the developers initially until we figure out what really happened).
