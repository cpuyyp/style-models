It means to honor the Buddha by working on purifying the mind and attaining freedom from suffering as he instructed. 

Buddhists in Asian countries have a practice of offering the best portion of the meal before noon to the Buddha before they start eating. You can also show your gratitude to your parents/wife/friends who prepared it. More importantly, you can practice Satipattana while eating 

Here in Sri Lanka we have Dansal(alms giving stalls) on poya days. Just like how Anathapindika used to do in Buddha's time. Anyone and everyone can come and take as much as they like. I had free ice-cream on last Poson poya day. Usually they give away food items. But recently some have even started giving away phone reloads. 

Doubt(Vicikiccha) is a defilement. Do Vipassana meditation. Samatha is not necessary. Once you attain the first stage of enlightenment(Sotapanna), doubt will be completely cut off. Do not stop the meditation to think up theories regardless of what you saw or felt. That will either take you in wrong paths or slow you down at best. If a thought of doubt enters the mind, note it as doubting... doubting... doubting... until it goes away and then get back to your default place of focus. Keep meditating until you reach Nibbana. 

Rebirth in a Buddhist context does not involve a belief in a soul. It merely refers to the continuation of the mental-physical causes and effect process after death. It should not be confused with the Hindu belief of reincarnation. However if a person clings to the view that everything ends after death, he/she wont be able to attain Nibbana as it falls under Uccedavada. 

Attachment to anything causes suffering. Not just the end result. But lay people are not expected to give up worldly goals as long as they don't break the 5 precepts, don't get into wrong livelihoods etc. Such conflicts occur when one tries to implement aspects of monk life while still staying in lay life. 

A real Buddhist is a person who takes refuge in the Buddha, Dhamma and Sangha. Dhammapada, along with it's stories are a part of the Dhamma. So if you reject the stories and still claim to be a Buddhist, you are essentially saying that you don't accept those stories as a part of the Dhamma. But it's a bad practice for a person to start deciding what parts of the Tipitaka or commentaries belong to the Dhamma. Especially someone who's neither enlightened nor omniscient. Because that habit can leak into much more important teachings as well. Like questioning if there's rebirth or Nibbana. Because you don't yet know them by direct knowledge, just like psychic powers. So you are taking them on faith. There's a way to attain psychic powers and it's explained in the text. Just like the way to attain Nibbana. So why not take psychic powers on faith too? It's not like you can disprove them. Vicicicca(doubt) is one of five hindrances obstructing the path. You are rejecting the stories because of your Vicicicca. Not because of your direct understanding that the stories are false. So you are actually empowering a mental state which is harmful to the path instead of gaining any real knowledge about the authenticity of the stories. On the other hand, if you can simply accept them on faith, Vicicicca has little room to enter your mind. That'll also make you less distracted when you listen to the Dhammapada. 

According to the Abhidhamma, a single cognitive experience consists of 17 continuous thought moments. Here is a useful Abhidhamma manual which explains those 17 thought moments. Look for the "Mind in its passive and active forms" section. 

By practicing monastic life, if you mean becoming a monk, it's a no go with your current condition. But if you just want to practice meditation, staying at a monastery, you still have to give up Marijuana and Nicotine. No serious monastery would allow you to smoke while you stay there. Some monasteries allow lay practitioners to take just 5 precepts and have food in the evening as well. But usually you have to bring your own food for evening meals. I would suggest for you to do an online meditation course and to get advice on how to give up your addictions while consulting a doctor to treat your ailments without Marijuana and Nicotine. 

If it's a bad idea and if you are his friend, you should try to convince him not to go too. Explain to him why it is a bad idea. If he listens to you, you would've done him a service as a true friend. If he does not listen, that's his Karma. 

AFAIK, breaking precepts that result in unwholesome Karma is never excused in Theravada Buddhism. Especially the five precepts. Here are few examples of the Buddha using Upaya: 

Theravada Buddhism is not a representative of Hinayana. Just because some choose to call a derogatory term to certain traditions, doesn't make them representatives of the term. ex: If someone calls you a peasant, does it make you a representative of the word? Even if one does not mean it as an insult anymore, it's technically incorrect to use the word as Theravada Buddhism clearly recognizes and supports attaining enlightenment through all three Bodhis. 

It depends on what the society consider as an adult. Back then in India, women always had a guardian regardless of their age. But things are quite different nowadays. In most countries when one reaches 18+ the society consider that person as an adult that no longer requires guardianship. Any care given after that is optional and any care accepted after that does not make one a minor, unless there is such an understanding between the 2 parties. In other words, when you become an adult by law, if your parents continue to give you food and lodging with the mutual understanding that you will not be sexually active with someone without their permission, it breaks the 3rd precept. 

Meditate on the doubt until you realize that it's just another mental state that arises and falls and that holding on to it is useless and does not lead you to freedom from suffering. Take it on faith, accepting the fact that you are not capable of knowing all that is possible with your current state of mind. And then do #1. Do Samatha meditation, follow the instructions given in the Visuddhimagga that lead to attaining magical powers. Waste your life trying to scientifically prove or disprove whether supernatural powers are real or not. 

It's similar to going to a funeral, seeing the dead body and realizing that your turn is coming too. Jealousy is a subset of aversion. Aversion is 1 of the 3 evil roots that causes suffering. So if you realized that and got rid of your jealousy, that's inline with Buddhist insight. 

There's a high chance you might be just practicing Samatha instead of Vipassana. When you sit for meditation, If you feel a pain, itching or any other sensation on the body, being mindful of those is Vedananupassana. In Samatha you just ignore those and focus on the breath. That's not Vipassana. If the mind starts to wander, thinking of past/present/future thoughts or if it becomes focused, being mindful of those mental activities is Cittanupassana. In Samatha you just ignore those and focus on the breath. That's not Vipassana. If you hear a sound, smell etc. or if desire, aversion, laziness etc. arise in the mind, being aware of them is Dhammanupassana. In Samatha you just ignore those and focus on the breath. That's not Vipassana. 

Because of clinging. Clinging to family, clinging to lovers, clinging to property, clinging to comforts, clinging to all kinds of sensual pleasures which the monastic life wouldn't have. 

If you are looking for supernatural powers, Samatha meditation practices are what you are looking for. Read the Visuddhimagga. It has detailed explanations on how to attain various powers. But make sure to find a good teacher who has experience with Samatha meditation. Trying to do it without guidance can be dangerous! They say you can go crazy. 

AI is a concept. Not a reality. AI in essence is simply electrified hardware. A computer is Rupa. Electricity is Rupa. There has to be Nama involved to talk about rebirth or having a consciousness. A computer might beat a man in Chess. But it's still just matter. No mind involved. 

The forming and the destruction of the universe has nothing to do with Nibbana. Space is a secondary Rupa element and time is simply a concept based on the change of conditioned phenomena. "bubbles forming in boiling water" is an analogy for a physical behavior. Nibbanna is not physical and whether the beings attain it or not, the world systems keep getting destroyed and reformed. It appears that the word 'Nirvana' is casually thrown in there to make some kind of connection with Buddhism or his notion of it is different than the Buddhist definition. This article says he is a Pantheist. Pantheism can be a convenient diplomatic stance for scientists who wouldn't want to lose the majority theistic audience in the USA. 

Yes, they commit Kamma just like humans. But their range is limited compared to us. They are unable to commit highly potent good/bad Kamma except on rare occasions. Their minds are clouded by ignorance most of the time. So it's highly unlikely for them to commit a Triple Rooted Kamma required for a perfect human birth. Examples of animals committing good Kamma(first 2 are highly potent due to the purity of the recipient): 

For Lay people: 7th of the 8 precepts Nacca-gita-vadita-visukkadassana mala-gandha-vilepana-dharana-mandana-vibhusanathana veramani sikkhapadam samadiyami - I undertake the precept to refrain from dancing, singing, music, going to see entertainments, wearing garlands, using perfumes, and beautifying the body with cosmetics. The 8 precepts are usually practiced on Poya days and when you stay in a meditation center
