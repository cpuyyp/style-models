Nobody knows - yet. But one can say that these rings are too numerous and too regular in shape to be related to either kimberlites or (even more bizarrely) Oklo-type natural nuclear reactors, as some have suggested. For what it is worth, here is my own hypothesis: The areas concerned are all periglacial in an area of abundant boulder clay. In colder analogues, particularly in Siberia and further north in Canada, such environments contain 'pingoes' aka 'hydroloaccoliths', which are frost heaves in the shape of ice lenses. See, for example, $URL$ . These are feedback processes of circular ice formations which develop in permafrost tundra areas. The circles you refer to are exactly the right shape, diameter, distribution density, and geology to be 'fossil' (melted) pingoes. Consider what happens when a pingo develops. The ground is highly crazed with fractures over a disk shaped area. If there is brackish groundwater in the area then the ice freezes as pure water, thereby partitioning more saline groundwater to the perimeter - thereby leaving a high-salinity ring of brackish water which subsequently stunts tree growth (as you observe). When the ice eventually melts the pingo collapses to appear much like the surrounding boulder clay, but with a fractured and much more porous texture. Wherever there is a confined or semi-confined aquifer - which is very common because thick layers of impervious boulder clay behave as a confining layer - there will be a tendency for groundwater to rise as artesian (non-overflowing) conditions. Hence the 'bulge' of the apparent water table, which you also observe. If this explanation is correct then the ring would be a natural exit and pressure release point for confined groundwater, and hence for entrained methane. Methane builds up under boulder clay, especially where the clay overlies peat deposits, such that oxidizing organic matter reduces the water. Moreover, this redox contrast, between surrounding oxidized near-surface/perched groundwater, and the reduced groundwater exiting from the ring, would also influence the nutrient availability, thus contributing to the ring of stressed vegetation. As for the change in electrical potential, that is easily explained as deriving from the contrast between normal and residual more saline groundwater. Also, if the pingo was weathered during its evolution, then there would be a difference in clay content, which would also contribute to the electrical differential. Indeed, that is to be expected when a hill (the pingo) is drained by meteoric water, taking with it any dispersive clay (another common feature of boulder clay). So no, sorry to disappoint, but the explanation is probably just normal periglacial hydrogeology - no gold deposits involved. The test to verify this hypothesis? It needs someone to run a traverse across such a ring, measuring the hydrostatic pressure variation (horizontal and vertical), soil salinity, and soil clay content. 

This is a very good question. I just took a look at Erlund's paper and note that the geochemistry may say some interesting things about the origin of the magma. The authors were much more interested in the processes that affected the magma after it was formed and do not get into the origin of the magma very much. But the Mexican belt is a subduction zone and the key is that it is subducting relatively young oceanic crust. When the crust goes down young and therefore relatively hot, the crust can melt. The magmas generated when the crust melts are very different than those that form when water is dehydrated from the crust and goes into the mantle and causes melting (the typical process in arcs). It turns out that young crust melting gives a very distinct rock that displays a very specific geochemical signature called adakites. There are adakites all through the Mexican subduction zone. The Par√≠cutin rocks are right on the border as far as whether they match adakite signatures and they could be partial melts of the slab. Sr/Y and La/Yb are the keys but they did not analyze Yb and the Sr/Y ratios place the rocks just on the border of the adakite field. The rocks have very high Al2O3 which is another characteristic of adakites. 

So back to these 2 bodies of water in question. Some people consider the Caspian sea to be a lake and others consider it to be a sea. While historically, it might have been part of a sea, it is landlocked now so it would be more suited to call this the Caspian Salt Lake, thus making it the largest lake on Earth and also the largest saline lake. The Great Lakes are also in question, to me at least. While the majority of the world considers them lakes and they were historically a lake(really, the rivers and small lakes in that area connecting them are so small in comparison that it is basically 1 body of water), the Erie canal has since then connected the lakes to the St. Lawrence River. So it would be more suited to call this the Great Freshwater Sea. I have no idea how this would rank up to other seas like the Mediterranean Sea in area but it would be the world's only freshwater sea. So why are the Great Lakes not considered a freshwater sea when other than the freshwater, they are essentially like any other sea? 

There are micro-tectites galore, strewn over thousands of square kilometres. But remains of the actual bolide? Hard to say, because the impact crater is now buried under 600 metres of sediment. Earlier this year the joint IODP-ICDP drilling program drilled to a depth of 1300 metres. As far as I know, their findings are not published yet. 

Perhaps surprisingly, the average rainfall per unit area over the ocean and continents is not much different, namely about 3.0 mm per m2 per day between +/-60 degrees of latitude (where most of the rain occurs). The oceanic average is based upon IR satellite date of cloud-top temperatures, which correlates pretty well with rainfall. Thinking of tropical rainfall, and particularly monsoon rainfall, there are many regions where the mean annual rainfall exceeds 6.0 mm per day. Against this must be considered the great desert areas where average rainfall is almost nil. The latitudinal variation is graphed in $URL$ . 

From me looking at maps, excluding the Caspian sea and the Great Lakes, I see these in common for seas and lakes: Seas 

I know that St. Elmo's Fire is a form of plasma that occurs during thunderstorms that is similar to lightning because it is formed by a difference in charges. But why isn't it dangerous if St. Elmo's Fire is around you? For one, the fact that there is a charge difference usually means an electric shock, whether that is a tiny bit of static electricity from touching metal or a lightning strike. Yet St. Elmo's Fire is caused by a charge difference but doesn't give you an electric shock. Also if there is a charge difference around you, lightning is more likely to strike you, even if you are as low as you can be. This can lead to heart problems such as tachycardia, fibrillation, or asystole. It can also cause uncontrollable muscle movements which itself can be dangerous because if your muscles are out of control you can end up anywhere. Muscles being out of control can also mean things like vomiting, lots of mechanical digestion, high blood pressure and more from involuntary muscles being out of control. In any case it is dangerous to have voluntary or involuntary muscles out of control. It can also cause nervous system problems, in particular excitation toxicity from positive charges continously reaching neurons until they don't send a signal. So with all the health problems that can result and the difference in charges itself without an electric shock, why is St. Elmo's Fire not dangerous? 

Firstly I would disagree with your premise that 'most of Earth's sand contains tiny shells resembling sea shells'. Such biogenic sand is certainly true of some biologically productive sedimentary environments, but certainly far from all. For example, try finding shells in most of the sand in the Sahara desert, or any other desert for that matter. You will only succeed if the sand is reworked from previous biogenic sandstone. As to the resolution of shells at the apparent scale of your photograph, it depends upon the biota involved. The bioclasts vary from several millimetres to true microfossils - far below any visible resolution, and maybe even below resolution of small microscopes. I assume that any close up photo of Mars sand would have been magnified, contrast stretched, and computer image enhanced. Had there been any bioclastic grains, I am sure it would have been front page news around the world. 

no, it is not due to lush vegetation (that was not around until just hundreds of millions of years ago). The period around 2.5 billion years ago is known as the great oxygenation period. No one knows for sure, but it was probably caused by anaerobic bacteria producing oxygen for the previous billion years. They basically destroyed their environment by oxygenating earth. We have copious quantities of iron-ore formations (the banded iron formations) around this time to prove that the earth basically rusted. The free iron in the oceans picked up oxygen and precipitated out Fe2O3. Finally oxygen got high enough about 700,000 years ago to allow the first multicellular life to evolve. BTW I think the diagram is pure speculation but would alsolike to know more about the source 

I suggest that all the relatively small earthquakes in Oklahoma that have done minor damage are the result of fracking. I don't know much about earthquake history in Oklahoma but I would not expect the center of the continent to be that active (Cairo, Illinois area being an exception) 

It's actually an inordinately difficult problem. Neither the land nor the sea level is stable. A tide gauge along a coast needs 30 to 40 years of data to filter out the very noisy tidal and other weather signals. By the time one has homed in upon a precise average, one is already within the time-frame of land uplift or subsidence, and that is before we even think about the complexities of climate-change generated sea level rise, or quasi-decadal oceanic oscillations. Then there is the question of Earth's non-homogeneous gravity which affects local sea levels. For example if we correctly measure the elevation of a Himalayan peak relative to average sea level at the Gurarat coast, west India, we get an elevation of 'h1'. We can then measure the same peak relative to sea level in the Ganges delta, east India, which we will call 'h2'. We can make all the usual corrections for Earth's curvature etc., yet h1 will be different to h2 - though both are 'correct'. There is no stable bench mark on 'God's Earth', so maybe the answer is to get off the planet completely. Satellite orbits are not perfect, but they are predictable, so satellite-based measurements of elevation are the best available.
