I have some knobby cross-specific tubular tires (Challenge Limus 33) mounted on a bike and I want to change them in exchange for slick tires for a period of riding primarily on the pavement. While they are excellent tires, and have a lot of life left, the road noise is undesirable. Can these tires be reused after they have been separated from the rim tape and/or glue? 

I'm riding a new bike (new to me) and I am unfamiliar riding with some of the components, specifically the cantilever cross brakes. On my road bike, I toe in the brake pads to help with noise, feel, modulation, etc. On this bike, the brake pads contact the rim pretty much evenly and don't have much modulation. They are making a fair amount of noise right now. I've done the obvious things to fix this besides toeing in the pads. However, they don't really sit in and tilt around slightly on a rounded bushing when loosened like on normal road calipers, allowing for toeing in. Is it possible to toe in the pads on these brakes? If so, how? 

So my question is what makes a "trials" bike, and, what are the most important features to consider when either buying a used one, or building one myself? I'm specifically interested in the wheel sizes ( why choose one over another ), dropout types and rear spacing. 

I am going to build a bikepacking bike and was thinking about what type of tires to use, tubulars, clinchers, or tubeless. I own a road bike with clinchers and a cross bike with tubulars, but have no experience with tubeless. In the context of bikepacking and riding long distances in the great outdoors, often far away from any type of help, I'm wondering which tire choice is best suited for reliability and ease of service? I'm kind of assuming gluing on new tubulars and carrying them, is a bad option, although I love the comfort and grip that come with low inflation pressure. Clinchers are great but I might want to run low pressure without worrying about pinch flats. I don't know much about how tubeless tires ride or how easy they are too service. Is there a preferred setup for bikepacking? 

During the 2017 Tdf, Tim Wellens abandoned during stage 15 due to bad allergies and not being able to breathe. The commentators said that his team would not "give him a waiver" to take allergy meds. What exactly is a "waiver for medication"? Why does one need one during a major race and why would Wellens' team not give him one? I can see how something like pseudoephedrine or a steroid could cause someone to test positive for prohibited substances in a race with strict substance rules and testing. Is this the entire reason that he was not granted a waiver? I would think Wellens could/should have taken something benign to help, like a benedryl, in order to continue the race. 

You will never really know until you get a fitting and ride it for some time, then you can really say, "Oh I wish I had gotten a bike with less reach", or "Man, I wish I had gotten a frame more less trail or a shorter wheelbase. 50cm actually seems a bit small for someone 5'7" (I would think 52-54). But, there are numerous adjustments you one can make once one has ridden the bike and knows the pain points. Also, recommendations for sizing vary depending on the manufacturer and what type of bike it is. Other than fitting charts which you have obviously found and used, you need to be on the bike to know if it fits you, not just a generic person who is 5'7". 

Does a race quality carbon wheel set stay true longer than an aluminum one (with equal abuse/mileage) ? It seems like the properties of carbon would resist flat spots and warping better than aluminum. Is this the case? Also, is carbon easier to true than aluminum? Aluminum can get bent badly and be rendered useless; does this happen with carbon or does it just crack? Thanks 

Evidence, not sure. I can say I've used the Park Tool chain cleaner, which is pretty much a bath, along with Simple Green solvent for years with no problems whatsoever. 

There are many ways to remove grease/oil from a rotor at home. A simple degreaser will do the trick. Make sure to use a towel that doesn't already have grease on it. If the degreaser isn't cutting it, you can move on to using ethanol or isopropyl alcohol, which most people have in the house. If you are still having a hard time, try pure acetone (nail polish remover). Get the non scented, non colored kind. It's usually less than a dollar for a bottle at the pharmacy. I'd also suggest using rubber gloves to protect your skin while using any of these chemicals. 

Front QR is to be exactly parallel to the fork arm. Rear QR is to be positioned exactly half way in between the chainstay and the seatstay, oriented to the inside of the frame. 

I was wondering if it is possible to to use a magnetic trainer as a dynamo. While riding on trainers, at a gym, or at home, I always think to myself, "I wish I could capture all this energy and put it to good use". Has anyone ever turned a trainer into a dynamo? If so, I'd like to know what modifications are needed and what tools and parts are necessary, plans, etc. Moreover, I'd like to know if it is then possible to use this dynamo to supplement power to ones' home, as opposed to just storing it. While discussing it with a friend, the main challenge that came to mind was converting the current to A/C and synchronizing the phase, voltage, frequency, etc. with the power coming into the house. Probably a bit overkill if you're not an experienced electrician (which I'm not) but maybe I'm wrong. If hooking one up to the home is not realistic, is there any simple configuration that one could use to provide useful energy and store it? 

I'm looking for an 11 speed 12-25 cassette compatible with a SRAM drivetrain, however I don't think SRAM makes one. They list specs for their 11 speed cassettes as follows: 

I normally ride regular 700c alloy wheels around town and for sport. Not deep section in any way. They're great, no noise or complaints. Recently I got a pair of really nice mid section wheels (Zipp 303 firecrest disc). Last time I was riding them, I noticed a "wooshing" sound when cornering hard and certain times while just riding fast. I've also heard this noise when being approached from behind by a rider who is passing quickly, much to my chagrin. Often they are riding a nice bike with a pair of deep section carbon wheels. Since I've never heard this on any other bike I've ridden except the one with the 303's, I've attributed the sound to the wheels. So my question is, am I correctly attributing the sound to the wheels and, if so, why do deep section wheels sound different than a regular wheel? If it is the airflow over deep section wheel hoops thats "wooshing", does that mean a less turbulent airflow, i.e. that of the 303's vs an alloy hoop, can and does generate more noise than a less aerodynamic wheel with more turbulent airflow? 

I'm beginning to see manufactures making carbon hubs and am wondering if they have the potential to perform better than conventional metal hubs or if they are just a way to save a couple of grams of weight, possibly at the expense of performance. Edit: These are the hubs I was originally asking about, manufactured by enve. They have a full carbon shell and flange. The flange is not drilled, the holes are molded as such. 

The article mentions reducing "unsprung weight" as an advantage, what does this mean and why is it advantageous? Quote from yamaha-motor.com.au: 

The frame comes stock with 160mm rotor in front and a 140mm rotor in rear and uses a spacer for the front post mount only. From this link, it looks like you need the 20p spacer, which Avid says is OEM only. However the spacing dimensions are 12.5mm top and 7.5mm bottom. You can probably find spacers of those dimensions to mount it without the OEM spacer. I have the same bike with a 160mm rotor in front and I can confirm the dimensions are 12.5 top and 7.5 bottom and it looks like spacers would work as well. Here is what the spacer setup generally looks like - 160mm with OEM spacer on front, and 140mm mounted with no spacer on rear.
