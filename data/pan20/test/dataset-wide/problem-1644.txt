Any coating with carnauba wax will not rinse off in water, nor will it wash off with vinegar. It is soluble in ether, but that's not a big help. Any coating with shellac will not rinse off in water. You will need to use an baking soda (alkaline compound) to remove it. The polyethylene emulsion will depend on the particular compound used. 

Without getting into the blatant commercialism on the site, I'll concentrate on the 'detoxification' recommendation of: Coffee Enemas. These are most often touted as being either detoxifying (as in the Gerson Therapy), a preventative for cancer or a treatment for cancer. There is no evidence that coffee enemas are beneficial.

I have to go pick up my son from daycare, but I'll discuss the ozone portion shortly. ...shortly is about a week later! Sorry guys! Life intruded. Nothing on the Gerson page specifically mentions ozone therapy, at least not that I've seen. Anyone suggesting you inhale ozone is, quite simply, an idiot. They're also putting your health at risk. Ozone is a pollutant in the atmosphere. (It's vital in the stratosphere, but tropospheric and atmospheric O3 is a pollutant and detrimental to human health.) Ozone exposure has been long known to exacerbate asthma. See McConnell, et al Asthma in exercising children exposed to ozone: a cohort study Ozone in your indoor air will also react with any VVOC, VOC or SVOC - very volatile organic compound (formaldehyde, methanol, methane), volatile organic compound (benzene, limonene), or semi volatile organic compound (PAHs) - the same as it does when it creates photochemical smog outdoors. 

Did the military drop it without parachutes? Almost certainly. It's a standard method with standard procedures to follow. Was it destroyed on impact? Probably not. A certain amount of breakage can be expected, from containers that fail to open properly, or from supplies that land badly. If all the intact supplies have been removed, it would give the impression that everything was destroyed on impact. 

All species of hardwood tested were found to have bacteriostatic or antibacterial properties that plastic lacks, which compensated for the inability to easily clean the wood's pores. 

Can they form near the the equator? Yes. Cyclone Agni from 2004 is probably the best example of this: according to the India Meteorological Department, it was 1.5 degrees north of the equator when it became a tropical cyclone, and before it reached that strength, the circulation center may have crossed the equator twice. Is it normal? No. There are any number of sources that will tell you that tropical cyclones normally form at least 5 degrees poleward of the equator (eg. this NOAA page (warning: contains Geocities-style web design)); most of these trace back to work by William Gray, but the general situation can be summarized by the following image: 

You've got two questions there: 1) Did the NSA pay RSA Security $10 million to make Dual_EC_DRBG the default? Quite likely. The way the statement by RSA Security is worded does not deny the core allegation of the Reuters report: 

Did they? It's easy to find people claiming they made the statement, but I've been unable to find a quote that actually traces back to the WHO. Are they likely to have made the statement? No. According to a CDC study, in the United States (a location not generally considered a hotbed of starvation), the average adult woman in the year 2000 consumed 1877 kcal/day, far below the 2000 kcal/day threshold the WHO supposedly uses. The 2100 kcal/day in the report found by Geobits is a population average: averaging across everything from a newborn baby to an adult male performing heavy physical labor. Is there a definition for starvation based solely on calories? Probably, considering the number of people who like defining things, but I doubt anyone would take it seriously. Virtually everyone (eg. the FAO) defines "starvation", "chronic hunger", or "undernourishment" as simply "insufficient energy intake to meet energy needs". 

Given that Dundee voted Yes to independence and their representative claims there was no impropriety with the counting, I find it implausible that the vote there was rigged in favour of voting No! I don't know where the first image you have is from though. 

This means that nearly all cervical cancer cells contain HPV DNA. I don't know if any studies have been done to infect animals with an HPV equivalent to see if they develop cervical cancer. But a correlation of 100% is pretty compelling evidence by itself. 

This means that the effects of a USA vs EU airbag is quite different. The US airbags will save the life of an unbelted adult, but can cause injuries in the process, especially to children. 

This shows that not only did humans evolve in response to milk consumption, but the cattle evolved to better produce that milk, as cows were under selective pressure from human preferences. 

And this was confirmed in landmark experiment in 2011 published in Science. Here a worm (C. elegans.) which normally reproduced both sexually and asexually was modified to isolate a strain which only reproduces sexually, and one which only reproduces asexually. They then infected the worms with a bacterial parasite (S. marcescens) which can proved lethal within 24hours if the worm is not resistant. Both the worm and the bacteria can evolve resistance/virulence over time. In this experiment the sexually reproducing worms had a much lower mortality than the asexually reproducing species when infected with the bacteria. This effect was much greater after being co-cultured with the bacteria for 10 generations, where ~70% of the asexual worms died while only ~18% of the sexually reproducing worms died after 30 generations. The asexually reproducing lines all went extinct after 20 generations.
