Please refer to the instruction given to Potthila by seven year old Arahant,"six openings in a mound where an iguana make it home, to catch this iguana, close up the five exits, wait for to come out from last exit." So you will see the benefit of meditation with closed eyes. At the same time, during every day activities, you can do mindfulness practice in every moment. Our mind is constantly disturbed by lobha, dosa and moha, once coming out of sitting meditation practice, your mind is so calm and undisturbed with Samadhi that clear the delusion previously covered. It is not hallucination. 

Everything it depends. Buddhist know exactly what is karma and its result. It is not like in the court in front of the jury, plea guilty or not or what will be the punishment, or trying to dodge with excuses. Everything done with good or bad intention carry its karma. And if one did it towards which types of person who is laymen or Arya. Also it is important in which way you apologize to this person one insulted through which person. But good karma goes far beyond bad one and it depends how good and how bad. Some examples as stone sink under water but kept on the boat big enough to keep it cannot sink. So not to do the bad karma is the very first thing. If one did it, apologize directly to that person, if that person is no more, apologize through an Arya(Triple gems) and to get the big boat, practice insight meditation earnestly. 

Because of the long samsara one had passed through, some places if one had frequently got through(for many rebirths) with unsurpassable worldly feeling/Tanha, it might be difficult for concentration. But only the Buddha know exactly all the being samsara and their attached Tahna. But it is not for every body. So generally it is not applicable for everybody (only in exceptional case). The same applied to past work habit, food fondness etc. The most important thing is to relentlessly work hard toward nibbana following the Buddha teaching. 

Giving offering to animal, human being, a person with sila, a person of four Arya (sotapanna etc), to Buddha, dedicated to whole Sangha, giving metta, having insight meditation all these are stepwise higher degree of dana, while noting matter(rupa) during insight meditation, 500 millions deeds just in a wink of time one got dana merit, while noting mind(nama) during insight meditation, one billion deeds just in a wink of time one got dana merit, topmost dana, unsurpassable dana, dhamma dana, Buddha and arahant used to praise such dana. How can the tank ever be empty or nothing left to give? 

Not only anatta, all three characteristics: anicca , dukkha and anatta if one realize will definitely help. Depend on the personality and past deeds, one will come to know through insight meditation, the true nature of these three characteristics and get enlightened. If one have much more dukkha, he/she will suffer great difficulty to get through the severe pain during meditation. Enlightenment through truly realizing Anicca is smooth and just to know what is what. In case of anatta, it is more and more subtle. 

It depends on three things. If one has big enough karma either good or bad to carry through afterlife, it will surely be carried through. If no such big or remarkable karma, the last moment recall what one regularly or frequently done karma which is passed over to immediate afterlife. If no two above is in effect, the very last moment karma reflection will have its effect. So it is not to question 50:50. 

Brain is just matter(rupa) not nama. Brain is just like the something recording what is happening. Not to mention Arahantship, once Sotappana, this attainment of Noble truth never get destroyed not only in this life, it will be beyond life. So all Arya never lost their dhamma, even brain(mere rupa) is destroyed. 

Once one achieved stream-entry, one will know what is what. The same applied to once returner, non-returner etc. In layman term to make clear, if one go to a retreat home/dwelling, the entrance to the dwelling is the path(magga) and the dwelling where one(stream-enterer) stay is fruition(phala). But magga is very very short just like passing by the entrance while phala is the stage where one (stream-enterer or once returner or non-returner or arahant) can be in this stage for long enough depend on the concentration achieved just like dwelling in a retreat home. If pre-determined before meditation session, can stay in the specific fruition stage for a definite period of time. 

Layman(non-Arya) is blind with lobha, dosa and moha , so no wonder cannot see through Arhat, but if you follow his teaching and get enlightened, you have no more doubt. Exactly to say, Sotapanna can teach one to be a Sotapanna, Sakadagami can teach one to be a Sakadagami, Anagami can teach one to be a Anagami and Arahat can teach one to be a Arahat. If you follow his teaching and get enlightened, you have no more doubt. Nowaday, still there are Arya. Try to catch the train if not will be left. 

If your target is nirvana, picking up everything on your way delay your journey. Just like passing through the path on fast going train, you will see the things left by easily while walking through , you will see the things more and more. What I suggest is focus more attentively on meditation without embracing anything just noting "know it." Actually you are definitely on the right path. Keep going paying respect to Dhamma and your meditation master. 

There is so many hindrance to focus in meditation. To overcome this, one must be truly modest first. To take refugee in three Gems and also to the meditation master. To ask for pardon for all the misdeed physically, verbally or mentally either knowingly or unknowingly. Also to forgive everybody for their misdeed to you. All the preparation made with strong belief, it is easier to get concentration. After that with the most comfortable, posture, start noting mindfully "breathing in, know it, breathing out , know it" focusing at the tip of the nose and no where else. Still difficult to focus, just remember Arahan or any qualities of Buddha which you prefer and after that resume meditation. It will surely help you. 

Buddha sasana is Sila, Samadhi and panna. Depend on this one will see through the dhamma to certain extent accordingly. If to compare Buddha knowledge to the deep deep ocean, sotappana has one length of bamboo plant, sakadagami, twice, anagami, thrice, and arahant, four time of that bamboo length to measure the depth of deep deep ocean. So rupa and nama how come and go, you can see through depend on your level. 

Yogi with dedication work hard in meditation achieving lower nana stages step by step , will attain the knowledge of equanimity regarding the formation where all notice on phenomena is so clear cut that each and every detail can be noted without much effort and to the exact timing. With more effort and further concentration, noting on these phenomena become faster and faster , more and more subtle with great moment until all of a sudden, all these cease to be, reaching gotrabhu. 

Glad to hear you achieved certain steps in insight meditation during retreat. Your achievement will never go back if you continue mindfulness in every day living noting not detailed but grossly as when you eat , just "eat", when you walk" walk", or "move", when you touch water, "cold" or "hot", like that as simply doing as possible so that your concentration will surely help you at your short sitting meditation. All these concentration will surely lead to higher stage of insight meditation. 

We have passed through the Samsara with no beginning, through these rounds of birth and rebirth we have come across many peoples, things with what we now in this life sometimes face again and again depending on our karma. In accordance with our morale, concentration and panna-wisdom, we see these reflections sometimes in the lucid dream. If one come across like that, one should note them with mindfulness, at the same time contemplate the effect of karma and dreadful knowledge of long long samsara passing through and try to cut off these attachment working hard for emancipation by means of nothing but insight meditation. 

As you have breath as meditation object, and the more you concentrate , there will be a stage of less experience of body and mind. It is one of the progress depending on the individual concerned. At that point , actually no need to increase your energy. Meditation is should not be as what you want. This is the nature you have to observe mindfully. Otherwise you will not see the three basic facts Anacca, Dukkha, Anatta. If you go on meditating breathing mindfully, it will become more and more subtle and fade out, come again and again like that. These are the stages you will be observing in meditation. So try to keep on doing and never try to change it.
