Aside from the psychological question of whether to act or remain static with respect to harm and blame, such as in the Trolley Problem (or Train Track Dilemma), it seems that many folks like to think in black and white. Recent discussions pertaining to terrorists comprise one set of examples relating to whether to kill or let be, ban or accept. Another important consideration, which is probably more related to ego, beliefs of soul and causality, and ideas of punishment, is that it feels better (emotionally) to put others into categories of good and bad, good and evil, without considering the finer details and factors of causality involved. A person is often seen as either "civil" or "criminal", as if these words really describe a person's value or virtue whatsoever. Hence, if people see Hitler as being "evil", they may feel that any showing of sympathy is intolerable and unbearable. After all, why would you help a "bad" person? Society would need to accept the idea that causality is complex and that most ill events cannot rightly be blamed wholly on one entity. Furthermore, it is absurd to think that Hitler alone "did" what they say "he did". Leaders are often spoken of as if they personally enacted all the events that unfolded under them. Also, what is to say that there were no pressures on Hitler from others? Could there, for example, have been friends, family, or lovers peer-pressuring him to act in certain ways? Maybe some person or entity was even manipulating him in one way or another. I doubt he was magically impervious to influence from others. Moreover, Hitler is by no means whatsoever more evil in nature than a relatively large portion of society both then and now. A great many people exist today, who if they were in a position of great power, would do great harm to a great many other people and or things. Taking it even further, imagine putting a 4-year-old child into a position of great power. That would be quite scary indeed. Are 4-year-old children then evil monsters? Well, perhaps, but the point is that society involves interaction, and almost all large-scale events could not have happened without a great many hands at play -- both physically and in terms of social and or financial influence. 

In Three Dialogues, Berkeley advances a theory of subjective idealism. Things only exist as experiences of individual consciousnesses. These things are static and themselves unthinking, as they are pure ideas. And they persist even when we are not looking at them because God is looking at them all the time. Here's the thing, though---if esse est percipi, how do we exist? We aren't always perceiving ourselves. We sleep, for instance. And our actual selves are not just pure ideas. We are active and thinking. So we can't exist in God's mind in the same way that, for instance, a tree does. If only unthinking substances can be perceived, and only that which is perceived can exist, how does anything exist to do the perceiving? 

The best response to a "counterexample" to Kant is, "So what?" Providing counterexamples completely misses the point. Kant's task is to start essentially at the beginning, by analyzing the pure concepts of morality, duty, freedom, etc, and to see what he can make with them. While we would of course like to have the results of this investigation match up with our every moral intuition, we cannot possibly require this. Then we would be stipulating the correctness of our intuition, something which we have no justification for. 

Of course we do have some rational beliefs, so we have to put some trust in the mechanisms by which we acquire beliefs. But of course we also have some irrational beliefs, so we shouldn't just trust in our ability to form beliefs blindly. In fact, we can be certain that our belief-forming mechanisms are sometimes unreliable, or else we would never have wrong beliefs. 

If the following answers are strictly related to one particular religion only, you may ignore this. If you can find anything sensible/true, you may search other websites and test them. 

This is because you are not quite sure whether that is a good thing and also that (good thing) would happen smoothly. Something that works against your ego would also make you sad. But this depends on your character. Otherwise the outcome would be in the form of rage. 

(Though I am not a native speaker of English, I guess) This term is often used for getting the MINIMUM requirements for creating a mental picture of something. We can use "What is" for the minimum information (as a word) and also for a very extensive explanation that contains different types of information. Let's check whether the usage 'MINIMUM' is correct or not. A person (especially, if he doesn't know English well) often uses/can use "What?" to mean "What is?" if he can't hear or understand the question he was asked; no matter whether it is a wh-question or a yes-or-no question. The shortest response will be "What?" to mean "What is?". Here "What?" is used just for repeating, sometimes for an explanation. So we can confirm that the usage 'MINIMUM' is correct. Other wh-question words can be reworded using "what", I think. E.g.: When --- at what time where --- at what place who --- what person (You will have to add "is" to each word given above.) I think this is possible with other wh-question words also. If all these question words (given above) can be compared to tools, "What is" acts as our hand for holding those tools. I mean, we can't use tools without our hand. Similarly, other wh-questions would be useful only if they got the help of "what is" (as the soul). E.g.: The question, "Who is that person?" won't be meaningful if it doesn't mean "What is the name of that person?", "What is his relationship with this area/the other person?" etc. $URL$ To summarize: "What is" is an alternative term that can be used instead of any wh-question words. So it can mean all the meanings that wh-question words imply. 

Doing nothing may not be ideal, but in itself it is practically neutral. Implying that a person is acting immorally by doing nothing is implying that the person has an obligation (or duty) to act upon these types of situations. A security guard or police officer is a person specifically paid by society to act in this capacity. For such a guard or officer to do nothing would indeed be grounds for immorality (and failing to do one's duties). As for solutions to this problem, I have two possible suggestions: 

The basic premise here is that there are more ways to have a positive effect on the world than directly getting involved in specific instances of wrongdoing. Sometimes just bringing an issue to light, especially if you have clear evidence of the wrongdoing and a clear argument as to why it is wrong, can make a big difference in the long run of society. The history of humanity will always have wrongdoing in it. In fact, these events may even be necessary since we learn from our mistakes -- and without mistakes, we can hardly learn. Pointing out mistakes can go a long way, even when done after the fact. On the topic of Trump and Hillary, if you honestly would rather not vote for either, then another option is to speak out your reasoning. Explaining why you do not accept either candidate lets others in a similar situation know they are not alone. For maximum effect, be honest, clear, and well-composed. Remember: The long term is bigger than the short term; you may not be able to change a particular election cycle, but you can still have an effect on society. 

Infinite Thought, Introduction by Oliver Feltham and Justin Clemens, p 25. There's a bit of a mistake here, because (p 24, itself citing Being and Event 146) 

In Affect: What is it Good For?, Mazzerella distinguishes affect from emotion. The key difference is that affect is presubjective. I have a pretty good idea of why emotions have to be subjective, and what it means for them to be subjective. But I want to say that anything capable of experience is a subject. Is that true? If so, how can a component of experience be presubjective? 

(OGM 1:13). The triumph of slave morality came about when Christianity conquered the west---Christians being the inventors of slave morality. (Actually here Nietzsche says Jews but he's pretty clearly not talking about actual Jews; he has nothing but praise for the Old Testament.) This is probably the weakest part of the argument and some later commentators take the slaves' revolt in morality as either semi-mythical or tied to capitalism. Now unless you are already inclined in a Nietzschean direction this should all seem pretty implausible. So much of his argument depends on how it all hangs together as a coherent story, and I cannot present very much of the story here at all. So I'll leave you with a motivating example: 

The answer to the question you ask in your title is no---that's actually a formal fallacy called denying the antecedent. But I think you're asking about the contrapositive instead. The argument presented looks like this: 

Unjust prayers You correctly note that God , even when such a prayer entails injustice. This is however not a problem with prayer but rather our flawed application of it. Of course God will not grant a prayer for an unjust action; such a wish is, I think, probably to be counted as a sin. Prayer generally But of course these are not the only kinds of prayers. The more interesting question is, why pray at all? After all, God has perfect knowledge, and God's will is immutable, so if you are in the kind of trouble that God would help you with, God is already knows about it and is already either going to help you or not. From Aquinas's Summa Theologica, Part 2.2, Question 83, On Prayer, Article 2, Whether it is becoming to pray?:
