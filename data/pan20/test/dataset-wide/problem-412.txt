In the case of the katana, speed and cutting edge were primary. If you could create a lighter, tougher blade which held a very good cutting edge then that may be advantageous to the wielder. In contrast, one of the defining characteristics of a long sword is its weight. To make it considerably lighter, even while maintaining all other characteristics may make it an unsuitable weapon for the situation. Once firearms made heavy armour obsolete then lighter, faster edged weapons returned to the European theatre. There may be a place for your weapon with late cavalry units. 

The most common factor in successful suicides is "access to lethal methods" What survivors of jumping off bridges almost universally say is that on the way down they realised that everything in life can be fixed, apart from the fact they've just jumped off a bridge. 

Taiwan Taiwan is a strange case. As you're probably aware PRC claims Taiwan is part of its historic territory. This is true. The reason they don't control it is that Taiwan is actually the Republic of China, the old nationalist government that lost the communist revolution but they're still hanging on in Taiwan. This is why their status at international level is so complex. Should the communist government (and population) suddenly disappear then technically the government in Taiwan gets to step in and take control of the territory. 

For the transit generations the ship has to be enough, they have no choice, but for the final generations there's going to be a mounting excitement. For the first time in 600years something is going to change. A new world! A new home! There's a chance they might stand on a planet, if only they could live long enough. Many people might not want to actually move off the ship, but then there's no reason why everyone should, as long as the ship is intact. The advantage of a generational ship to a colony is simply that they don't actually have to disembark. The young and adventurous can go off to tame the wilderness, while the old stay home. Growing food, running communications, mapping the planet, running the labs, making sure you can actually eat the local vegetation/animals. There's a lot that can be done from orbit. Even if everyone wants to go planet side you'll probably have to force some people to stay on the ship for another generation just for some of these functions. The opening of a new world will trigger the wild west mindset in some people, but not everyone, and that's just fine. 

It's as much modern attitudes to sickness that have changed as modern medicine. In most western countries it's considered unacceptable to spread it around. Consider a normal person with a severe illness. Most people in such a situation would call in sick and not go to work. Those who do go in are frowned on by colleagues for risking other people's health. You don't "man up" and go in regardless because that's antisocial. This means that even though we live in a high density world, and theoretically diseases could spread very rapidly, our attitudes and behaviours while sick will make most diseases self limiting. 

Similar to the North American plains? Every time they try to settle there 60 million buffalo migrate though their crops, trampling everything, demolishing the wattle and daub buildings and taking the domestic cattle with them. It's all a bit demoralising really, so they stuck to the edges instead. 

1 A non-zero probability is a non-zero probability, you could also win the lottery every week for the rest of your life, it's non-zero. 

I'm going to say yes, with a very strict condition. You must justify a reason for plants to need to be intelligent and communicate. That's going to be the hard bit. As soon as you can do that they're free to evolve into an advanced race. This means that in practice the answer is no. You're better off waiting 100million years for some sort of animal life to evolve to intelligence. 

There are advantages to doing this in the water over doing it on land, including shockwave propagation due to the incompressibility of water meaning they don't have to be particularly accurate to hit a large number of targets, but your intended principle is there for you to work with. Given a pack hunting Velociroopter that rounds up the prey as ocean predators do, rather than land predators who tend to run it down, then attacks a target with the tail meaning they less vulnerable to horns or other defences. Perhaps it could be a viable hunting technique on land as well. As for your primary question: What would be the personality of such an animal? Controlled, sociable, pack hunting. Probably high intelligence with solid communication. Definitely not a nutter. In fact less aggressive, it's fundamentally a lower risk attack. 

Fuel expires, tyres rot, most importantly: batteries go flat. Most of my cars of recent years have been inaccessible with a flat battery, even trying the key in the lock gets you nowhere because that apparently just sends a signal to the servo to open the lock. (Information from direct experience) 

You'd get significant sexual dimorphism. Firstly, there's no reason for the males to be intelligent, there's no apparent advantage to it. It's a lot of energy to burn for such a short lifespan. I'd also expect them to be considerably smaller. Since one sex is intelligent and the other not, you'd need a system by which the females picked partners. Are they strong? They can't risk fighting as males are not disposable. Are they colourful or showy? Devious? A mix of all the above? Sex balance among the spawn: You'd need significantly more males than females. At least one male for every litter that a female would bear in her lifetime, per female offspring, per litter. They'd have to breed like rodents. You'd probably need to have a flat minimum of one female and four males per litter to increase population at all. This still only allows a maximum of 4 litters per female, which is ridiculously low in the real world. The males mating to death? Not such a problem. Though in these cases they mate with as many females as they can before they crash and burn, and for some reason nobody has mentioned the elephant in the room that is the praying mantis. 

Not at all. There are many places with these characteristics that do not have major city status and the elements that you have selected were often secondary. London is the city I know best so we'll use that as an example. Access to the North Atlantic: Completely irrelevant for the first 1500 years of the city's existence. Even when it became relevant, there were better ports to use, Bristol, Southampton, Liverpool. London was built for easy access to France and is the merger of the cities of London and Westminster (aka Ankh and Morpork). What you need to build a major city: Let's start with what you need to build a city at all: Water London sits on a massive underground fresh water reserves, it also has a lot of (mostly now underground) fresh water rivers running through. To make it a major city: Communication, trade, transport. For much of history these were the same thing. The only way to get anywhere was by sea, even until the industrial revolution, it was cheaper and easier to ship from Lisbon to Liverpool than to go overland from Liverpool to York. Trade and transport are still key, hence why the British Government is desperate to expand one of the London airports. Make it your capital. How many of the cities on your list are not the (state or) national capital? (Hong Kong is a special case, Shanghai was a different special case). People are attracted to the centres of power for whatever reason, once this has started it tends to continue. People go to where the jobs are, the jobs go to where the people are. Outside Dubai City, the rest of Dubai is a wasteland. The main reason London is a key global city is Empire. It was the centre of the world for a century. Capital of the last global empire. The wealth of the world passed through London, as did the people of the world. The city is built on that. It's not the best port, not the best harbour, it's not the best building land, most of the area close to the river is below high tide and marshland. The tide in the river flows too fast etc. Political Will. This is the difference between a merely big city and a major one. 4 of the cities in the top 10, Hong Kong, Singapore, Shanghai and Dubai, were built by a government basically saying, "we want a major city, put it here". In these cases a small settlement or port already existed, but was expanded by political will. In conclusion. The factors you provide are required to make a great city, but they will not alone cause a great city to exist. 

Oh boy, magic wielding chinless wonders Breeding for a single trait always causes issues, as any critic of pedigree dogs will tell you. If you want the society to be stable, you need to allow a level of social climbing. As it stands you have a rapidly decreasing, increasingly unhealthy, aristocracy who aren't going to survive much longer. The thing with surviving aristocratic families is that they rarely let vanity stand between them and survival of the family line for long, if they do they cease to be a surviving family. "Pure blood" is a vanity issue, lack of money and bad genes are a survival issue. In this case you can add magical power to the survival side. In the long run, (money and) power is likely to be the driving factor. A peasant with a bit of power rises a little. A rich merchant's daughter with a lot of power can rise a lot. The father can gain a lot of credit by marrying her off to some inbred scion of a great family in dire need of a little genetic diversity (and an injection of cash). In time the wealthy and magical become junior nobility. Junior nobility can become senior nobility by some great act. Members of the establishment can in time join the aristocracy. The sons of the aristocracy sow a few wild oats among the peasants, meaning the occasional peasant crops up with magical power. This allows a little outbreeding in what is otherwise going to become a highly inbred and dying society. 

You may want a blade you can drop down the outside to clear away the buildup of bits of zombie on the cutting edge. As a final note on this 

Opium Its long history allows it to be referred to at just about any technological level also it can to be something known rather than having to discover it along your story line. You can discover the plant growing rather than having to discover knowledge about it. 

The trick here is to be paid twice for the same job. Abuser elimination as a service The first question is as follows, what went wrong in your market that the NGO is buying the rights when they should either be being paid for the service of removing the person in question or accepting a contract to remove the person pro bono publico? The victim should be paying the organisation, not the other way round. After that it's just a matter of selling the right to legally kill someone into a suitably sociopathic market. One person removed, two paychecks. Depending on the culture, you can now add other options. Battle Royale for example, all the targets are rounded up, placed on an island and the survivor after a week gets to live (at least long enough for the post production interviews). Television rights provide the funding. The Running Man, again a TV game with the winner getting a tropical island holiday (there are never any winners). There are any number of ways of making money out of televising the hunt. 

The gold ring both makes you a lord of the realm and the ultimate outlaw. Luckily King James I of England was originally King James VI of Scotland so the usual Scottish rebellion is quiet quiet at this point in history. The biggest problem I can see here starts like this:
