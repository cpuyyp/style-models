I think your problem, really, is that there is no one acting as a technical authority. There needs to be someone who is responsible for the final decision when the team is divided on which way to go. It's difficult to develop software, especially in a business setting, purely by consensus. Everyone developer will have a certain amount of bias: maybe they want to use a technology they've never used before, maybe they want to take as many shortcuts as possible because they're feeling lazy, or maybe they want to re-write an entire library because "that's not the way I would have done it". You need someone to control these tendencies. I can see why your manager is hesitant to comply with your request. When you say to her, effectively, "the team isn't listening to me, you should promote me so that they have to listen to me" then obviously you've got a vested interest. If you genuinely want the team to function more effectively, rather than just to get your own way because you're feeling stubborn, you should suggest to your manager that a role is created which has the ultimate responsibility for any technical decisions that are made. You should note the benefits this will have for the team. Tell her that you would be more than happy to apply for this role but ultimately that you will be happy as long as someone is responsible for giving the team direction that it needs. 

Simply present the context of your discussion and explain that you are sending this email because she/he asked you to do so. Then reaffirm your interest for the summer internship. Do not forget to add you availability in case she/he wants to contact you by phone. It will perfectly do the job, while emphasizing your interest and motivation for this internship = perfect. Sometimes, when recruiters ask for an email reminder it's simply to be sure the applicant is still motivated and interested in the position. Tricky I know ;-) 

If you send your application and get no feedback you won't know if it's because of you not being able to speek Flemish or something else. If I were you I will simply ask this question: 1. Trying to ask recruiter by email or LinkedIn 2. Trying to call the company so as to ask someone 3. Sending my application anyway 4. Trying to reach someone again so as to explain the situation Do not be discouraged by not having a straight answer (or an answer at all) recruiter might be really busy (despite what you heard ^^) Do not wait so long before calling them to have your answer and do not hesitate to send your application in the meantime, it would be a shame being late for this application just because of this missing information. Best of luck ;) 

Yes, that's what the text you quoted means (but then I am not a lawyer and have no idea what other German statutes or case law might be relevant – note that this is the German implementation of an EU directive). But even if taking all 30 minutes before the six-hour mark is not mandated by the law, it does not seem forbidden either (“Die Ruhepausen […] können […] aufgeteilt werden.”) So your employer is probably within its rights by implicitly forcing you to take your breaks in that way, as long as you never have to work more than 6 hours in one chunk and have at least 30 min break in total (what the employer has to do is plan a break, not let you take it whenever you want). At the same time, it's not uncommon to see time tracking systems that implement such requirements incorrectly and your recourses are typically limited (I have seen much worse, to the point that it became a contentious issue in the organization). Employees or their representatives can ask to have the system fixed but until then, you don't necessarily have any basis to be compensated for those 15 min. Now that you know how the system works, it's up to you not to lose them, for example by taking a 30 min break in one chunk. You also have to ask yourself if you really want to make a fuss about this (and if you do, it's probably best not to do it alone but, e.g., through a trade union). 

I don't think this is rude at all. It seems like an honest attempt to assess what you know. As for the fact it happened with every question, perhaps you were misinterpreting his questions, or you went off on a tangent, or maybe the two of you were just on a different wavelength. If he actually thought your answers were bad or that you didn't know the answer, he wouldn't bother to rephrase. It would be a waste of time for both of you. 

I would like to reiterate what others have said: if an interview leaves you feeling uncomfortable, the place probably isn't for you. Don't be afraid to turn jobs down. You deserve to have a job you enjoy. 

I know people will disagree with this, but just to play devil's advocate: discontinue using it and wait to see if they contact you. They'll realise their mistake eventually. In the best case for you, they'll see they have a large amount of unused balance and they'll get a refund from the card provider, or reassign the funds to other employees, or splash out on a big team meal (just kidding - get back to work, slackers!) and they'll consider that the end of it. In the worst case for you, they'll contact you and ask you to pay back what you owe them. Do so promptly and do your best to make the process easy for them. If you do this, they won't hold it against you. Financially, this will result in the best outcome for you in the average case. Is it ethical? We all have different opinions. You'll have to decide for yourself. That's more of a question for a different site. 

Many useful answer but I feel another perspective might be useful. Sounding arrogant is to some extent in the eye of the beholder. In some cultures (national and/or corporate) sharing knowledge or correcting a superior might simply be unacceptable. One answer is therefore: Realize this, try to accept it and do your job as good as you can. If you feel this is impairing your own development or future career or if there are legal ramifications or risks for third parties, this might not be the right course of action but ultimately you are not responsible for the whole company and all your coworkers. Besides, is your team unable to function or deliver anything of value? Can you explain some practical benefits to your preferred approach (as opposed to it being new and considered a “best practice”)? If not, it would suggest that your coworkers' approach is good enough. 

In countries/jurisdictions where the law does not provide for clear limitations like this, employers might be tempted to slap a broad non-compete clause on everybody's contract – that might be the source of the story you read – but that does not mean they would necessarily bother with enforcing it in each and every case. And I currently work for a very large company, in a locale where the rules are pretty lax, yet my contract only has a very reasonable non-compete clause so don't let this stop you from applying wherever you want. If that's really a show-stopper for you, you can always ask about it after you got an offer and before handing in your notice for your current job. Finally, a friend of mine once switched from an employer to another one that was clearly covered by her non-compete agreement but her new employer was willing to cover any damages/penalty she might have to pay for breaking her contract and approached her former employer to negotiate directly with them. 

You cannot work in these conditions, a the end, you will lose your motivation and implication. You definitely don't have to accept it. But you have to figure out if you will be willing to quit your job if the situation does not change. If I were you I tried to discuss it with my manager or HR services once again explaining very clairly how this situation affects me in order to find a solution together. If they do not seem to care at all, I will simply start looking for another job. 

I totally agree with Nameless, the answer above seems really great to me. Do not forget to add your availabilities so as she could contact you whenever she wants. Be careful not to appear impatient is a really crucial point. Do not be affread by not getting any reply within a week, she must have a lot of email and projects to follow on (such as everyone). It is not anormal. However it is a good thought to email her again in order to reaffirm your interest in the position. In doing so you will show your motivation and remind her of you both at the same time. 

It's not uncommon but they vary a lot and the devil is in the details. Depending on the country/jurisdiction, there might legal restrictions curtailing the enforceability of such a non-compete clause: 

It's not an obvious double standard because you are not in the same position to begin with, being male. You just wrote you hadn't actually thought about it before, that's a luxury women don't have in general. That's just a fact. That's why it makes perfect sense to consider that the exact same words don't have the same meaning when uttered by a woman. That context makes all the difference. From that perspective, what you should do about the whole situation is educated yourself about the issues and focus on the more pressing problem (it's not men's rights or your boss relatively minor inconvenience…). 

Trying to provide a somewhat more nuanced answer between Alec's and Joe's, I would say it feels a bit mean but he does have a point. While it might feel intrusive, there are certainly other jobs in which this could be a problem. On the other hand, it's absolutely not true that it's going to be a problem everywhere. It all depends on the type of job, whether you clock in or not, etc. I have had jobs where I was mostly free of my use of time. I hope that if someone would have spent hours on the loo, people would notice and worry a little but, whether I came at 9 or 11 and went to the loo right after arriving, before leaving, or after lunch made absolutely no difference. In those type of jobs (i.e. outside of an assembly line or call centre in which every minute is controlled and accounted for), it's also illusory to think you can micromanage employees and increase productivity by curtailing toilet breaks. As long as you are not spending hours on the loo or otherwise slacking off in a big way, whether you do it just after coming to work or later in the day should therefore not make any difference and your boss complaining about that has more to do with asserting his power and control over you than anything else. Still, that's a factor in many workplaces so, even if I don't agree with some other answers' attempt to legitimate this, you have to recognise that it's not uncommon and be prepared to deal with it in the future. Practically in this case, since you are already on your way out, there is no need to overthink this. If preserving your relationship with that manager is important and you really can't help but go to the loo around that time, try to arrive earlier and do it before 11. It's just one month, after all. 

It is perfectly polite to ask for him to do that. Unfortunately, as others have already said, your request wasn't worded as well as it could have been and it did come across as if you were asking for their email. That's not necessarily a faux pas, but it's reasonable for him to have declined your (perceived) request. But what's done is done. There's no use now in agonising over the wording or the level of ambiguity in what you said (as some other users seem to be doing). What I would do now is send a very short email just to clarify. Something like: 

It sounds like a reasonable thing to ask but I'd expect they're only going to tell you what you want to hear. Remember as much as you're selling yourself in the interview, they're also selling the job to you. They have a somewhat vested interest to lie emphasise the positive aspects. "Of course we're accepting of transgender people" - no reasonable professional person would say anything else, regardless of their personal feelings. Perhaps the best way to get the answer you're looking for is to ask them to show, don't tell. "What support do you have available to LGBT staff? What's your policy on discrimination or workplace bullying?". These are questions with concrete answers. You can't BS your way through them. As with a lot of aspects of a new job, it can unfortunately be difficult to get a true sense of the place until you're actually there. I don't think it applies to you, but you should always try to use any contacts you may have within the company to get an unbiased opinion - a friend, a friend-of-a-friend, an ex-colleague. If there's no one like that, you just have to try your best to get a feel for the company. Perhaps a start-up is more likely to have a younger, more liberal, more progressive view of your gender identity. Perhaps a larger, more corporate place may have more structured support available. Good luck at the new place and with your transition. I hope it all works out well. 

It's not unheard of but certainly not a given so it's completely normal to provide one but also completely normal not to. It can be something you can negotiate individually before you take the job or something that is available to all new hires under certain conditions or provided for in collective bargaining agreements. But if your contract and/or company rules don't foresee it, you are out of luck. It's not something you can expect or that your employer necessarily has to provide. You can always ask (but it seems you have done that already) but there is no point in pushing it, especially if, as you wrote in a comment, you are not willing to walk away. Another solution to your rental problem however could be to ask for a salary advance from your employer. Unlike a relocation allowance, it will probably be taxed like regular income and you would have to pay it back in the coming months but it could save you money compared to staying at hostels and avoid a lot of stress. This is something I have seen in your situation (new hire from abroad who need money for a deposit - as opposed to being in debt or spending it on something crazy).
