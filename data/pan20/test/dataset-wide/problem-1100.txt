I apparently cannot figure out the key words to google search for what I want, so I need help finding out how to do this. I feel like this may be a duplicate, but I just cannot find this anywhere else. I would like to be able to easily save a bunch of create table/view/proc scripts to a file. The file has an easy-to-execute format that will drop and then re-create all of the objects, so it can be run on multiple databases. This format works well for me as I have to make changes to some objects during development, and then make the same changes on multiple other databases. I can just change the database and click execute. However, some of the scripts have A LOT of quotes in them, and it gets QUITE annoying to have to double/quad quote them every time I make a change or add a new object to the file. For instance... 

The problem is, as seen above, the records that have a and of 'IN', have a of "OH". This leads to the output to not contain SUI records for "IN" because no records have an of "IN" Is there any way to force "IN Employee SUI", "IN Employer SUI", etc... to appear with values of 0? There are many states where the State/SDI State and SUI State are different, so I cannot hard-code the logic in there. And here is some dumbed down similar data with my current query. The values aren't important in this question, only forcing the SUI records to appear for the state, "IN'

What is the possible use of owner of an SQL Server Agent job, I wonder? Removed, and left it blank and the job still succeeds 

Online MSDN article "Execute Statements Against Multiple Servers Simultaneously (SQL Server Management Studio)" (SQL Server 2012) states: 

I have a weekly and nightly SQL Server Agent jobs executing a weekly and nightly maintenance plans, resp. These weekly (on Sunday) and nightly (on other 6 nights of the week) maintenance plans differ only in the 1st task from total consecutive six steps. That is, in nightly/daily maintenance plan the 1st step is "Reorganize Indexes on all User databases" and in weekly/Sunday maintenance plan the first step is "Rebuild Indexes on All User Databases". Is it possible and how to run just one (instead of two) maintenance plan, all 7 nights of week, with condition that on 6 days the 1st step is one (Reorganize Indexes) and on the rest 1 day of week the 1st step is another (Rebuild Indexes) ? 

After installing Download SSDT for Visual Studio 2010 then Download SSDT for Visual Studio 2012 from Download SQL Server Data Tools - October 2013, everething seems started to work but I am eager to understand whether VS2012 setup damages SQL Server 2012 (i.e. VS2010 Shell) Data Tools for everybody or just me? 

As per output :- It is showing port 5432 which indicate there is no other cluster of postgresql with port 5433. Also command output show :- Your cluster main service is not running kindly restart that cluster using 

Now reload after changing in conf file On Standby server check recovery.conf file IP address of master must be contain following 

As per Primary server you have 1 table in your database ? Just setup mater-slave replication with reaming 5 servers as 5 slave and primary server as Master. Master will replicated data to all five respected slave server and you don't need to create tables For replication setup kindly follow the link :- $URL$ 

This changes all objects i.e tables, sequence,function etc owned by old_role to the new role. You don't have to think about what kind of objects that the user has, they will all be changed. This changes the objects only if u wanna change ownership of that database itself just use This is the best method as there will n number of tables, sequence rather going for loops and bash scripts 

You just need to correct archive_command just replace IP-address of path to which wal files will be archived e.g Also make sure the path permission is set to postgres user if not 

I have a dataset text query and I would like to have an ORDER BY in it. The issue is in SSRS, the ORDER BY is not working as desired. However, when I run the query in SSMS, the output is ordered as I would like. This image is in SSMS where it is working properly. The payroll = 000004 is just to isolate a specific payroll to make it easier to read. The ISNULL(OrderByNumber, 1000) is just to put the total row down at the bottom. 

I have a report that is "working" fine except for an issue. I have four dropdown list parameters where I am getting the values from queries. When I select a value from a dropdown list, it selects the next value below what I wanted to select, and "removes" the first value as an option. For instance, one of the dropdowns holds a list of payrolls. When getting the list from a query, it returns payrolls 1 through 121(or so), which is perfect. However, if I try to select any of the payrolls, say payroll 10, it will show me that I selected payroll 11, and the option to select payroll 1 will no longer be available. ALSO, possibly tied to the above, the report sometimes refreshes when I select "view report" and I have to try to choose the payroll again. These are not cascading parameters. The values are all derived from two queries where I am selecting a distinct list of employees for two of the parameters and a distinct list of payrolls for the other two. I am at a loss as to why this type of behavior is even possible. 

The rebuild of indexes takes appr. the same 55 min. with both "Do not rebuild indexes and "Rebuild indexes offline" "For index types that do not support index rebuilds" with "Keep index online while reindexing" checked 

On Windows 7 Prof I have installed SQL Server 2012 R2 with, as I am pretty well remember, client tools. Then, I tried to install Visual Studio 2013 Ultimate but failed. Then I've installed VS2012 Prof (30-day trial). Now, on launching SQL Server 2012 (i.e. VS2010 Shell)) Data Tools --> New Project I am getting: 

incur limitations on the whole server, the instance of server or specific database created as contained one? Apparently, it is only to contained database but, then, why it should be enabled server-wide first? and what does it incur (for example, if I enable it on server but did not enable it on any particular database)? 

I am having a maintenance plan configured with Windows Authentication being run by an SQL Server Agent job with owner 

In all cases I was using a domainUser login with sysadmin role for setting SQL Server Agent service and owner of an SQL Server Agent job (or, in the latter, tried also ), Windows Authentication to in used by them maintenance plans. The used domainUser is part of (local) Administrators group in each of the Windows (machines). The SQL Server Management Studio is run . How can I troubleshoot these errors? What should I check and look for? Specifically, I do not quite understand: 

If it matters, here is a screenshot of what I have in the detail view of the parent report. I am showing this to give context. Basically the parent report is a single cell of a table, which will feed a parameter to the sub reports, so the sub reports will only display records for a single payroll at a time. For instance, page one will be everything from payroll 1, etc... 

However, while only two states are pictured here, there could be 50 states. That part is done and looking good. The trouble I am having is to have the totals across all states at the bottom. At the very bottom of this post is a quick look at my parent report in SSRS design view, if that seems the best way to go. Below is an example source data table and my current query. The ordering doesn't really matter, it is just for ease of viewing. I am using a cross apply, but whether cross apply or pivot, it doesn't matter to me. 

With tons of values in the Cross Apply, it just gets annoying. How can I easily export the definition of an object to have double/quad quotes? 

I've tried to set Mater and Target Servers on various cobinations of SQL Servers 2012 R2 on Window Server 2008 R2 and Windows 7 machines but always getting one or 2 of the following errors during setting either target or master server: * 

while executing a rebuild from mentioned article and observe that it is being delayed until index rebuild finished What is blocking and how to avoid it?

Isn't it self-contradictory paragraph ("until" vs. "retained")? Then, if "the isolation level from the last SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL statement is retained" after closing the connection and returning it to a pool, how it should be understood: 

And here is the results I get in SSRS preview. Not ordered how I want at all :( As far as I can tell, SSRS should support ORDER BY in the dataset query. I also tried removing the ISNULL( ,1000), and the order by still didn't function as desired. Thoughts? 

I have a query that is working fantastically, except that I would like to force some records to appear. I am using SqlServer 2016, and this query will ultimately be used in a VIEW and used by SSRS 2016. If the desired behavior can be done in SSRS, or even changing to a PIVOT or some such, I am open to that option. I will put some DDL down below to mimic the example images shown. The data I am pulling from looks like the below: 

I need to troubleshoot an issue I am having, and I need some help understanding how sp_msforeachdb works in order to overcome my issue. What happens is every time I run sp_msforeachdb, I get an error An example of my code is as follows: 

I need to get some totals output in SSRS that I am having difficulty putting together. I am not sure if I should do the totals for the below query within the query, or in SSRS. The output is going to be presented as one long table in SSRS. I have some example DDL and fake desired output below, but to describe what I am doing, here is a quick snapshot of what I am trying to mimick in SSRS. 

5) If still unable to restore the database kindly take a fresh bkup with remove .pg and try to restore again. 

1) First switch to superuser 2) then created a new database --DROP is already created 3) now change the director to backup file path i.e 4) Now just run this to restore ur dump custom file 

The last_autovacuum is nothing but the last time at which the autovacuum daemon done the vacuuming process on tables The pg_stat_all_tables view will contain one row for each table in the current database (including TOAST tables), showing statistics about accesses to that specific table 

Restart the slave machine now And if u still unable to connect check 'replication' user privileges on master db it should have replication privileges 

On Master, pg_hba.conf IP address of slave machine will come. On slave , recovery.conf file IP address of master will come. Make sure both slave and master can ping each other . 

Yes it is possible the logical backup will be having data before failover say u took it on 3pm it will have complete data till 3pm And suppose you fail-over the master say on 4 pm the wal-files will have records of changes done from 3pm to 4pm. So just create a postgresql instance with help of pg_createcluster and inserted the dump file first. then copy the wall files to path which is default path for most postgresql installation. then finally restart the services 

After desperately trying everything from restarting and updating SSRS, to clicking my heels three times and throwing salt over my shoulder, the solution is to not use the Microsoft Edge browser. When I switch to using Chrome/Firefox to run my SSRS reports, the behavior is removed. Microsoft Edge version: 38.14393.0.0 

This gives a good idea of what I want to do, but SSMS doesn't like it, saying , and I'll start working on sample data to help, but I wanted to get this out now in case someone knew what to do off the top of their heads without data. 

I am getting a typical group by error that one would see when a field is not in a group by or an aggregate in the select. 

However, it does not matter what query I have as a parameter to sp_msforeachdb. Every time I get the same error. I do have a database that starts with '61s1d', so that makes me think it has an issue with the DB name, but I honestly do not know what is going behind the scenes on sp_msforeachdb. Things to note. 

I have a view in which I need to Group By or SUM OVER Partition By year and quarter, but the year and quarter will be computed within the view. I would like to keep it all within a view instead of needing tables and SPs. The goal is to get SUMs by of all records within the first quarter of a year, spanning over multiple years. What I have is:
