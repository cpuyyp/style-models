What's interesting is that the earliest known legal code, the Code of Ur-Nammu was a series of if statements: 

Since it seems like you're looking for constraints to help construct your language, I thought one helpful approach would be to lay out exactly what sounds you have to work with. I've taken a chart of the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) from Unilang.org and annotated it to indicate the sounds which are impossible without lips - crossed out in red. 

The only reasonable solution I can see would be if the sun appeared similar to our sun to people on the ground, but was in fact something with far less mass orbiting far closer. No natural entity or phenomenon really seems to fit these criteria, so it would have to be some kind of megastructure. It could be purely artificial, like a moon-sized heat lamp essentially, or you could posit that some advanced technology (magic) allowed the creation of a miniature star, fuelled by some means other than its own mass. Perhaps an extremely handwavey wormhole type arrangement siphoning off plasma from a real star elsewhere and containing it within a field of the appropriate size? 

Whatever is cheaper Your version of magic may include conservation of energy (???), but any type of free-market system (that is, there's no law saying what you must use) will lean on conservation of profit. If the protag's in an area, there's going to be leaning on whatever is in large abundance - If the area is like Venice, you're going to leaning largely on water travel. If you're in an area where you can hire an augmented 'running man' cheaper than purchasing and maintaining a horse, camel, mule or dog team, you will. There are also externalities to consider - If you're in a city or urban environment, do you want to deal with domesticated animal waste? Where are the animals kept when not being used? If you're in a rural environment, how does the environment impact an augmented person? Rain, Heat, et cetera? (I'm thinking of the story of the British trying to use the Irish for Slave labor, but they couldn't take the heat in colonies, which led to the slave trade to Africa) Are you advancing the plot in some manner? Is this a debate that the characters are experiencing, or the society as a whole is discussing? Are the augmented humans actually willing (skilled worker) or brainwashed to be willing (serf/slave)? Will there be a progression of enchantment, where today's work animals or augmented people pulling wagons will be replaced by self-pulling wagons? 

Just an idea that occurred to me – if you wanted a world that was geologically plausible on a planet similar or identical to Earth, you could always use the geography of Earth at an earlier time period, or even Earth with a higher/lower sea level. This doesn't allow you to "alter it in any way you wish", unfortunately, but it would allow you to browse the various continental configurations throughout the Earth's life and choose the one you like the best. Geography is a fairly different concern than geology, and you have a lot more freedom in this regard. You can probably draw a political map any way you like, as long as you account for certain reliable factors from human history such as civilisations liking water, political borders being demarcated by natural geographic features like rivers and mountain ranges, and powerful states having a preference for controlling their whole local landmass given the opportunity (e.g "Manifest Destiny" in the US, various attempts to "unify" Europe) Some resources: 

The most politically correct one would be the one selected by that minority group. In all cases of vernacular syntax, there's a wave of names that will be attributed to a certain group or groups. It follows a fairly recurring progression: 

Regardless of the size of the buildings, there has to be some basis on who actually lives in that space. In the Burj, no one lives in the tower, just the Y shaped base. If you're covering the planet with megastructures, and looking for the maximum number of people, you would use something similar to existing megastructures. The most populous metropolitan area in the world currently is Tokyo, Japan, with 37,833,000 people in an area of 5,200 square miles. This is approximately 7275.5769 people per square mile, which is a lot... unless you've got approximately 154 usable, habitable floors on the thing, which is a cozy 47 people per floor, per square mile. If you're going Coruscant-level construction, covering the entirety of landmass on Earth today (57,308,738 square miles), that will give you 4.169541303609522 × 10^11 people... about 417 billion Average Joes. 

A familiar trope that is sadly very much in line with reality is that if they have sufficient money, influence, manpower and cunning to begin with, they could begin by seizing control of the many (and large) areas of the planet that other people with money and influence tend not to think about very much. They could, for example, deal with/infiltrate/ultimately control the hundreds of little terrorist groups we probably haven't heard of. They could operate in any or all of the countries that westerners can't name and tend to lump together as our vague concept of "Africa". The only thing they would have to be careful of is not interfering with (and thus attracting the attention of) all the other powerful developed-world interest groups that are operating under more or less the same general principles right now, i.e. don't interfere with the supply of minerals to US corporations, recruit too many sweatshop labourers, or pirate any essential shipping routes. Think what had to happen for you to hear about Al Qaeda; now as long as our shadowy organisation doesn't do something like that, they're free to control the Afghan heroin trade, the South and Central American cocaine industries, any number of diamond and rare earth mines, and oil fields; think of the manpower they could muster simply by feeding and housing the millions of desperate people in any number of different places, or by creating an ideology that spoke to the even larger number of people with a great deal to be angry about and very little to lose. The best part about this strategy is that if any one of their proxy groups or individual operatives were to attract attention, it would be trivial to cut them loose, and let people's prejudices lead them to assume "those people" are "naturally like that". Anyone who suggested there was a monolithic organisation arming hundreds of unconnected terrorist groups and drug cartels, inventing new religious sects, and working in accordance with a colossal master plan would be dismissed as totally demented. Meanwhile, when the world powers responded by crushing the little people who got caught holding the rocket launchers, burning their fields, bombing their villages, and so on, they would only be exacerbating the desperate, unjust and anarchic conditions that made the developing/underdeveloped world ripe for their taking in the first place...
