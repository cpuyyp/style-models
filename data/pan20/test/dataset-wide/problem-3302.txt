the process of assigning a thing to a location (assignment? reference? indexing?) the thing that is assigned (referent?) the location that refers to the thing (pronoun? anaphor?) 

Spanish (at least in Mexico) distinguishes two different deixis factors. I'll show it phonemically instead of orthographically: 

In American Sign Language (ASL) a certain kind of anaphora is found by assigning things in the discourse to physical locations around the speaker. For example, if you say "my brother's new house" and gesture to a point off to your right, you've now assigned that referent to that location. Then you can gesture to that location again to use it like a pronoun, referring to your brother's new house without naming it again. Then you might say "the piano that fell on my car" and gesture to your left, and now you can gesture to that location to talk about the piano. What are the proper terms for referring to this sort of concept? 

In short, I'd say Khitan is probably the most like Kanji in its relationship to Chinese. Tangut seems more like Hangul: an independent writing system that, because of its place in the Chinese cultural sphere, was made to look more or less Chinese-ish. 

Many languages disallow vowel-vowel sequences in a word or phrase, instead inserting an extra consonant between them to keep them apart. Some versions of English do this, like when Kennedy would say 

It is possible that certain pronouns were borrowed into Uralic languages from Indo-European tongues. Other borrowings that would seem rare have found their way into the family, such as the Hungarian "száz", Finnish "sata", and Khanty "sot" for 100, which night have been either from an Indo-Iranian root like "satem" or Slavic "sto/sotnya". Scythian, an Iranian language, existed in central asia thousands of years ago and surely interacted with the early Uralic tribes; thus it might not be inconceivable to say that there were some borrowings from a more advanced society, and that there might have been some bilingualism. Scythian could have been a supplier of valuable items from the rest of Asia, like gold and spices, and therefore, it would have benefitted tribal chiefs and noblemen to know Scythian or a related language. However, there is still the possibility of false cognates here, like Hungarian "ház" for "house" (Finnish: koti; Proto-Germanic: husan). Such might be the case in the relative pronouns. As for "sinä/se", there would not be enough data to prove that the voiceless dental in Indo-European becomes a voiceless sibilant in Uralic, that is to say that "*tuH > se" is inconclusive at best. Nevertheless, cognates false or not never definitively prove a genetic relationship. The grammar and morphology must be considered. Finnish has thirteen cases, like the essive, partitive, and illative, which do not correspond morphologically with the eight cases of Indo-European well. Furthermore, cases are not normally innovative, and are usually barrowed from other languages that have them, like the adessive and illative cases in Lithuanian. Moreover, Finnish observes vowel length, with is not common in Indo-European languages, which might employ pitch-accent. 

So if I'm talking to you about something that's here in the same room as us, I'd say it's . It's here where both of us are. If I'm inviting you to come across the room to sit over here by me, I'd invite you to come . This emphasizes that it's over here by me, not "here" where we both are. If I'm talking about something over near you, I'd say it's . If I'm pointing at something far off, something far from both of us, I'd say it's . 

silent |k| This one doesn't come from Latin at all. In Old English, the word "knight" was pronounced /kniht/ -- both the |k| and the |gh| were pronounced. Over the centuries, spoken English changed so that now |knight| is pronounced /nʌjt/. The /k/ disappeared, but the |k| didn't, so now there's a mismatch between the spoken and written forms. 

Many languages have a suffix (or some other alteration) that gives a pejorative meaning to a word. For example, in Spanish: 

This is a very common phenomenon, where a sound in a language can be spelled in multiple ways, or a certain spelling can have multiple pronunciations. To give a quick answer to your question: Written and spoken forms of a language can change independently. Let's start by looking at the two cases you mention: |x| and |c|, and we'll also look at silent |k|. We'll follow the convention of putting spellings between |vertical pipes| and putting pronunciations between /slashes/. |x| might as well be |ks| Why do we have |x| at all? Historical accident -- the letter |x| was used to spell /ks/ in Western Greek, then was borrowed by the Etruscans, then by the Romans, then by the Saxons. Usually when people borrow a writing system, they borrow the whole thing, even if it's not a perfect fit for their own language. |c| says either /k/ or /s/ Two questions come up here: Why does |c| have two sounds? Why do we have |c| in the first place? 

This is the realm of pure fiction and art. There are several attempts in the origin of language to speculate on what plausibly could have come first-- for example, in Adam's Tongue, there is a discussion about if the earliest syntax was non-recursive "beads on a string" or if it used recursion and would be diagrammed with tree diagrams that look something like the sentence diagrams you saw in English class. But that is a long way from putting together a specific list of rules and saying, this is how they would have formed sentences. 

There seems to be some controversy about how an obviate proximate system works. I get that it doesn't work like a nominative-accusative or ergative-absolutive system. In some attempts to illustrate obviate-proximate systems, multiple sentences are used and the entity that gets the case ending keeps it for the entire discourse. So I think ah ha! So the system must rely on who is who because in one of those sentences is was made obvious by context or the like. This is one example of an illustration that relies on two sentence (or actually one sentence joined with a conjunction) Then the next illustration uses only a single sentence (all the examples on wikipedia are like that). So then I think, well this must not be a discourse level phenomenon. So how does an obviate proximate system work and what gets marked in a single sentence utterance? 

This is actually an very intriguing subject. I contend that, in fact, -alis/-alia are related to -ly/-lik/-lich, and that Hittite actually exhibits this feature in the autonym Nešili ([language of] Neša+ili). If you would like to ascertain whether Russian (about which I will confidently say I know very little) borrowed -аль from Latin, first look at the relationship the two languages have had over time. Then look at the words on which the morpheme is affixed. If they appear to be mostly borrowings, you could probable stop there. However, if you find them veritably Slavic, look to other Slavic languages for similar endings: start with Ukranian, then Belorussian, then go on to Polish (which is very conservative, and if there is any truly Slavic cognate to -alis, it would likely be in Polski), Slovak, or Czech. At this point, if you haven't found what you seek, chances are it won't be in the Southern Slavic languages either. 

It is impossible to really know for sure how a feminine marker "originated" in Indo-European, since the exact nature of gender there is unknown, since Hittite conveys only two genders (or states): animate and inanimate. Furthermore, "animalia" is a neuter plural. Nevertheless, it suffices to say that the Semitic ending in Arabic ة-/ية (-ah/iyah) is not at all related to the Indo-European one. Take for example a Berber word for "house": "tamdint"; the t-t indicates a feminine. The root is "mdn" like "مدينة" (medīnah, city) in Arabic, which becomes "مدينات" (medīnāt, cities) in the plural. Therefore the Eurasiatic theory is far-fetched. I might not have fully answered your question, but at least this hopefully narrows it. I think it is important to ponder this sort of thing, but the answer will likely never be known.
