Records occasionally get destroyed in accidents. You could claim you were from that area and get new documents that couldn't be checked. Another dodge I heard was to get birth certificates from people who died young in the same year you were born, and use them to request new documents. 

Well, unless the EMP plane is a suicide plane, it needs to have protection from EMP just to stay up and use its weapon more than once. So the other side just needs to steal that technology itself. 

An expansionist religion almost certainly needs a single, compelling message to deliver unto the heathen and convert them. It seems human nature that whoever comes up with this message, be it one man or a even a small committee, would then be imbued with the aura of a prophet or the equivalent. For example, the US "Founding Fathers" have a certain degree of that aura even though the creation is secular. I can only see it not being so if the document produced is something like the volumes that bureaucrats turn out these days...huge volumes nobody reads. And then nobody would adopt them and the religion would fade. 

In theory you can move a black hole. If you pump charged particles into the black hole, it keeps the net charge. This would make the hole respond to an electric field and in theory movable. Of course, if you have the technology to create immense charged beams and huge fields that can move a multi-solar-mass item about like a billiard ball, you might as well just use this stuff on the target right off, and skip the messing about with a black hole. 

Easily, but not for long. The water in a desert lake fed from the sea would be supersaturated with salt, and the inflowing salt would precipitate all the time, slowly filling up the depression. Unless the channel from the sea widens too quickly, in which case you get something like the mediterranean sea. 

There is a launch window from Earth to Mars every 800 days or so if you want to do conventional ballistic tajectories. If the orbits of the two planets were even closer, that would make the two planets more similar in habitability, and it could easily take five years or longer for the inner planet to make one orbit more than the outer. Of course the orbits can't be too close or they become instable. I haven't seen the calculations how long the average orbital period in the habitable zone of lighter or heavier stars would be, but probably different from our 365 days. Other possibility: A multi star system, where the differences are simply huge and you need swingbys with larger planets in both subsystems to make the tranfer oeconomically feasible. 

I'd say you could easily scale the large sailing ships of 1900 by a factor two (-> 220m long or so), giving a factor eight in tonnage (-> 40 000 tons). Modern materials and technology keep the crew size in the same region, 40-50 people. Going away from full-rigged to schooner rigs or multi-mast sloop is possible with modern fabric and keeps crewsize further down. Speed of practically any kind of ship scales with the square root of lenght, so you'll get around 14 knots average, unless you have a route with just very little wind. Modern weather forcasts will help here, too. Port maneuvers are helped by an electric bow thruster powered from a towboat (pusher) that runs on batteries charged on land. Towage was a huge problem at the time, when slighly adverse wind conditions at the port could allow tugboat owners to extort the profit of the whole voyage. Definitely something you want to organise. 

Without going into speculative climatology, I'd figure that the Baltic Plain would be covered with forest, much like North Russia now. What is now the Russian forest would be drier and colder, so more like Central Russian steppe. The major rivers could still have been used by Scandinavians to create "Rus" states in the area, but like Russia in real history these would be somewhat backward due to distance and issues with steppe nomads. So it would be like pushing Russia west over Poland, Finland, and the Baltics from the very beginning rather than after WWII. Vikings might have pushed west more than east, making England and France Norse. England in particular might have been like a displaced Sweden and less of a mix of influences. 

There was an earlier post about the moons of Saturn Janus and Epimetheus, that share virtually the same orbit. When they get close, the two swap orbits until the next encounter. This seems to be stable for them. So a 4 body solution for our Solar System would be 4 earthlike planets, 2 in Earth orbit and 2 in Mars' orbit. All should hold oxygen like Earth does and be suitable for life. 

You seem to think those people would have an unfair advantage over, and would use it to the detriment of others. First let me say (and I'm an atheist) that jealousy is a sin. Don't be jealous. Secondly, many people have advantages over others (money, health, education, bodily strenght, intelligence, beauty, whatever), and most people agree that the same law should apply to everyone. Thirdly, most societies have laws in place to keep people from exploiting their advantages in an unfair manner, and expect wealthy people to provide to the public welfare overproportionally. Now what should happen? Some of your nonsleepers could become very rich, so they should pay higher taxes. Same applies to other rich people. Some could become politically powerful. So are some groups of people today, and most of them haven't "earned" it. Or some of them could form a syndicate to enslave the rest of mankind, which is the moment to arrest them, and put them on trial, like you do with every other group of criminals. And yes, perhaps they should have their own sports competitions in some cases, like men and women and people with disabilites do. Nothing that the legislative should be concerned with. 

One of the major, if not the major, theories of how speciation occurs is allopatric speciation. You mention how a large population drowning out a new trait before it can spread is an issue with you, and so it is in conventional theory. This model posits that at the edge of a species' range, small groups will form a cluster breeding mostly internally, thus allowing a favorable change to take over the group. This group will also have additional pressure from the marginal fit it has to the environment, and thus a 'need' to evolve. Then if the environment in the whole changes to fit this group, it may spread out over the whole range. 

One thing that would be different is that the "blood tie" is missing. So either a sentimental tie to the one you found replaces it, or this would be a public duty. 

According to historian Peter Heather, the force that leads to the weakening of central governments in feudal states of the Middle Ages is due to the limitations of the non-cash economy in these times. Basically, in Ancient times, an Emperor could reward a follower with cash and jobs that come from tax revenues. These recur every year, so he can keep granting favors without losing his own assets and power. In Feudal times, the grants must be in land, which the follower uses to support himself. A land grant once given, is gone, and the king is now poorer and the noble classes stronger. An exception is if the feudal state is on a border with a weaker foe, and can expand to grab more land or loot which can enrich a worthy follower but not eat into the King's lands. But this usually doesn't last long. So the key seems to be for the King to find a "renewable" source of wealth or value that he can dispense to nobles as a substitute for grants of land. 

If temperature, radiation levels and water are OK, and you find a high oxygen level, then it is safe to assume some sort of life. Oxygen can be present without life, but not to >10%, and not on a planet that has an average of 25Â°C, water, and is not radiation hell due to an unstable mother star. Don't be to excited: Could be the only thing you finde are rocks coated with a thin, slimy cover of alien cyanobacteria. ;-) There is a readymade plan for a space-based coronagraph that could easily take the necessary spectra. NASA didn't (yet) like the plan, because it requires an extra satellite which is flown at a distance of kilometres from the telescope in the direction of the target. So it eats a lot of fuel and doesn't last very long. ;-) Bit more sci-fi? Google for the "exo earth imager". 

Definitely YES, for two reasons: Firstly because all their genetic parents will be rather on the clever side, as was already noted in the other answers. Not clear if the effect will be large. Secondly because those kids will grow up in a world without war, hunger, and poverty, much less drugs, and well educated parents, good own education, and proper health care. All kids have a good chance to live up to their potentials. 

I've heard that same stat used for dying by being buried alive...as you fix other problems and become less vulnerable, the chance of dying from one of the other causes goes up. The stat says nothing about immortality increasing your chance of cancer. If it did, then the 'eternal life' would have to be balanced against the decrease due to cancer risk. If this was negative, it wouldn't be worth taking the treatment. The behavior changes seems a stretch, as we already live with not knowing when we die. 

The main costs of a horse in real worlds is the food cost, and breaking and training the wild horse to obey the owner, and the cost of land for the horse to run around on and exercise. Having horses underfoot wouldn't allow anyone to "own" or "use" one at need unless these are provided "free" somehow or are magically unneeded. 

Just set up a system of GPS-like emitters on the surface as you go. As long as you were in range of one, you have a position on the map. If there is no ionosphere, you just need more of them. 

A major need that probably far outweighs items like tourist areas is that the building, fueling, and servicing of the space craft themselves requires a certain technology level of the host region. Borneo might be great for launches, but if the mechanics all live in the US that adds a lot of cost to the system. This service industry might also require space to work, so a tiny island is a suboptimal choice for that reason. The launch and landing areas might need wide spaces for safety. The passenger traffic in and out is important, but could be done by a fast train system or large airport without requiring it to be that near current major sites.
