Mars has no environmental regulations The environment is already incredibly hostile to life. You could make anything on mars and just dump the waste outside. No harm, no foul. Right now, that won't help that much, since you still have to get everything to Mars in order to turn it into stuff, but once we start mining asteroids, we can do the heavy (dirty) industry on Mars and export the finished goods to Earth. 

Solvent putting enough holes in gas bags made with ballistics in mind might actually be really hard. If you use something that can dissolve the cloth, it might penetrate much more effectively than ballistics. It's the difference between shooting bubble wrap with an arrow, and spraying it with acetone. 

Maybe they used to have real magic. Then it dried up, and now they have to fake it or get Game-of-Thrones'ed. 

Stone Age Tech The pacific Islanders were able to colonize the most remote islands without any technology you might consider 'advanced'. In fact, their sailing technology has been quite sophisticated for a very long time. They can effectively live at sea indefinitely. There's a good argument that the Ancient Egyptians sailed to the Americas, too: $URL$ The limiting factors in crossing a large ocean are not technological. Wind Conditions: Are there prevailing winds that allow for travel in both directions? The more consistent the wind, the easier the trip. Sea State: How rough is the trip? Rough winds and waves can make a trip much, much harder. For example, for a long time, it was more difficult to round the Cape of Good Hope in S. Africa than it was to cross the Atlantic. How frequent and how strong are storms? Is there a hurricane season? If storms are infrequent, it will be relatively safe, but the more frequent the storms, the more dangerous the trip. How cold could it get? Again, the colder it might get, the more dangerous the trip. The Vikings could cross to Greenland in the summer, but had a hard time getting to England in the winter. How abundant are fish? Pacific islanders can feed themselves on the go by catching fish. There is (was) a lot of life in earth's oceans. How frequent is rainfall? Stores of fresh water can be harder. With frequent rainfall, they won't have to worry about fresh water. It's also possible to collect water from condensation every morning, but this takes up a fair amount of space, so its hard to do on a ship. Most importantly: Does anybody feel like making the trip? People need reasons to make such a journey, especially when there might not be a destination. The Chinese could have discovered & colonized N. America whenever they felt like it, but they didn't for cultural and economic reasons. 

They might affect the wind more than the waves. If the islands are flexible, they will move up and down with the water, and won't sap much energy from the wave. With the sun hitting the island, making it warmer and changing the air pressure, it might cause the wind to change. A lot of weather is created by the differences of land & water. Without land your planet's weather might be a lot more homogeneous, and might not get many hurricanes. 

Yes, they could survive. Source: I bought a school of harlequin rasboras, and one of them had a problem with its swim bladder. It was constantly swimming up at a 45 degree angle, almost jumping to stay with his buddies. A month later, I've still got the same number of fishies, but I can't tell which had the injured swim bladder. It must have healed. Generally speaking, if the shot isn't to the head or heart, it can be survived. 

I doubt it. They used canaries because they (and other birds) are more sensitive than humans to toxic gasses. A canary's respiratory system is 20% of its bodily volume (according to this site) $URL$ Perhaps really large bugs would also work - the ones that are at the limit of a thorax based respiratory system. They could use pet tarantulas instead. 

You might need two sets of signs, computer monitors and stop lights. A color contrast that is clear to one species might appear a flat color to the other. There could be whole aspects of fashion that are literally invisible to the other species. in the case of humans and aliens, perhaps the aliens literally cannot see the differences in human skin color, but our hair or eyes might wary wildly to their perception. It might also be useful in engineering, like how Geordi from Star Trek was able to see things that were invisible to the human eye. 

The creature could reproduce by budding. Either Sexually or Asexually. Instead of growing their young in an egg or a womb, they simply grow out of their parents. 

I would use a week's travel as a rule of thumb. If it takes longer than 7 days to get somewhere, it will probably have its own government. There are exceptions to this: USA, Rome and China, for example, but in most countries, for most of history, you could travel internally anywhere in the country in 7 days. 

Make it a bubble of Time. Time and Gravity go together. If you slow down time just a tiny bit, you will create a gravity field. Gravitational Time Dilation is part of Einstein's theory of Relativity. The closer you get to an object of mass, the slower time moves for you. Want to have the effects of mass? Find a way to slow down time. 

Plants by themselves usually handle warmth and moisture very well. In the short term, most of them would thrive. Over the next few years, there would be massive ecological changes as some plants out-compete others in the new environment. Your world is going to get devastated by storms, though. If your world is heating up and 1 degree a month your atmosphere is going to be incredibly turbulent. You are going to see Cat 5 hurricanes, tornadoes, the works. Anything that's not bolted to the ground - and a lot of things which are bolted to the ground are going to get uprooted. Other areas are going to see massive flooding. 

Sounds like it would work to me. Get the dust moving fast enough and it should act like a shield. Keep in mind, though, that it would act like a gyroscope, increasing the ship's inertia. If you are accelerating the dust to relativistic speeds, it might make it almost impossible to accelerate or change direction. The dilemma for ship captains would be whether they try and Dodge, or turn up the shield and hope for the best. 

If you're looking to create an air-planet, have you thought about setting it in a nebula, and part of it just happens to meet Goldilocks conditions? Or what's wrong with having a nitrogen-oxygen gas giant? Here's a reddit thread about it: $URL$ 

Furs & hides. Harpies would be really good hunters. If you can fly and shoot a bow, you can kill a lot of critters. 

Yes, but the counterweight has to be past the geosynchronous orbit. Sort of like a cat's tail. The point of geosynchronous orbit is the fulcrum on which the whole elevator will balance. 

Absolutely. We used fossil fuels because they were there and they were easier than the alternatives - not because there were no alternatives. As AlexP said, water mills powered the first factories. 

We respect their decision We don't try and contact them. There are so many reasons that contact could be harmful - to them as well as us. We can't know the specific reason that they have not contacted us, but we can trust them enough to believe that there is a good reason. Space is really, really big. There is plenty of room for us both to do our own thing. In a few hundred thousand years - still a cosmic eye-blink - they might change their mind. If we know they exist, and respect their decision not to form contact - we have already taken the first steps. We have looked each other in the eye, then gone back to our cell phones. Best not to appear to eager, y'know? 

Drill you can get down through the ice either way. When it comes time to go home, your submarine needs to be able to climb out of the ice. You may be able to get out with an ice volcano, but I wouldn't want to count on it, if I was on the sub. I'd want the ability to drill upwards at an angle and haul myself out on treads. 

All the parts of the machine are wireless Most robots are operated with wires connected to a computer, but it doesn't need to be this way. If your robot is going to be taking damage, the wiring is a weak point, since a cut wire can disable the robot. As an alternative, parts of the machine can communicate to each other via wireless (like bluetooth). Your projectiles could work by: Jamming the signals The projectile broadcasts a powerful signal on the same frequency as the wireless, preventing the parts of the machine from receiving signals. Decrypting the packets and issuing new commands This is a little less plausible, since encryption is hard to break and very easy to upgrade, but if your projectile can read the packets and transmit them back to a server, that server could get going on cracking the encryption. Once cracked, the projectile could pretend to be a part of the machine and issue new commands. 

A rookery. A large group of ravens with cock-fighting barbs on their legs. They can out-maneuver the larger dragons, attacking its rider and weak points, like the eyes. If you have the right kind of wizard, you could even put bombs on some of the ravens, and have them akbar into the oncoming dragon. They might not even need any training - they could instinctively attack the dragon as a flock, just like dolphins will attack sharks. 

If they can figure out how to make a screw driver, they can probably get the rest of the way to a computer. Perhaps they can hold one thing in their mouth and another in their anus. Instead of chairs, they could wrap themselves around a cleat to gain purchase. Humans are arguably intelligent and definitely worm-like - and we managed. 

Mankind's ability collaborate large groups (hunting parties and armies) outweighs any advantages other species may have. Humans have not always been at the top of the food chain. There used to be a lot of animals that would prey on humans. The Haast's eagle is one example: $URL$ Bears, wolves, elephants and lions have also been driven out of most human areas. If there is a species out there which hunts humans - even only occasionally, we hunt it right back until it's gone. If someone died in the night with fang-marks in their neck, every man in 50 miles would get together and crack open every tomb until they found the vampire. Then the vampire would wake up and be surrounded by 800 men with stakes. If he turned into a swarm of bats and flew off, they would individually stake every bat for a hundred miles. If the elves in the forest punished a human for poaching on their land, it would be even worse. Some lordling would see an opportunity to take the forest for himself, rouse up a mob that outnumbered the elves 10 to 1 and go collect their ears. If the humans are vastly outnumbered by an inferior species intent on their extermination, well, we have examples of that, too. Israel stood against millions of Arabs and beat them all like rented mules. tldr; humans are the most dangerous & aggressive species we know. 

People move around. LGBT's especially tend to cluster in a few places where they can practice their own culture. For example, the ratio will be higher in Manhattan than North Dakota. We don't actually know what causes homosexuality. Most people accept that people are 'born that way', but there are plenty who become homosexual while in prison, then go back when they get out. There is poor historical data. While we know that people were freaky since Socrates, we haven't been counting things like this for very long, and the numbers are heavily influenced by culture. There will always be some that do not report accurately. How many? Well, how many deer did you not-see on your way to work? As far as I know, we don't know what causes homosexuality. It could be a recessive gene, or a common mutation (like dwarfism), or it could be additives in the water. Maybe some kids just played with glitter too much. Who knows?
