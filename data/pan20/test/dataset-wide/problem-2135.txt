Being fresh out of school, many interview processes will ask for a resume and a copy of my latest official grades from college/university. I happen to have one of the classes I have taken, that was particularly relevant to my field, that had me finish with a terrible, but still passing, grade. (I needed 60 to pass, and got 61.4). I figured that there must be many people who pass by the skin of their teeth, therefore it shouldn't be such a surprise to an employer. But I also happen to have very good grades in basically every other course, almost always above 85, so I don't want to come across as one of the people who pass with bad grades because of their abilities. The thing is, I almost failed that class because I skipped the final exam, that was Worth 35% of the grade. This is because I had two final exams that were scheduled at the exact same time, so I went to the other one, since I could pass that course without it (I would have failed the other course by missing their exam). I had tried basically everything with the school to either move or retake one of them, but the only options available were creating other conflicts, therefore not solving the problem. I was following a non-standard study path, and ended up with many courses that were not expected to be taken at the same time during that semester. How can I explain that grade without sounding like I'm making excuses, in the context of a job interview? I feel like I have a good reason, but I guess everyone probably feels that way and the interviewer most likely heard every excuse in the book already. 

I am currently working as an intern (with a good pay). I have had trouble on my project, and took more time than what was expected of me to find what was wrong with a part of it. Now the deadline is coming, and I know I can't make it. Since the internship is almost over (2 weeks left), and I'm not studying in the same city, I can't continue working for this company after it is done. I am not supposed to work more than X hours per week, and I am not entitled to any sort of overtime. On the other hand, the schedule is flexible, so it is possible to work more hours on certains days and fewer on other, as long as we do X hours a week. In that case, I could work about 5-6 extra hours while still staying withing the allowed work hours, before that deadline. I care a lot more about making a good impression on my employers, so that I can either get hired there after I'm done with school, or at least get a decent recommendation, than I care about the money. I wouldn't mind at all working those extra hours and not saying anything, so essentially doing those hours without pay. My main question is: Are there are downsides, like breaking some sort of law (I am in Canada), to doing this unpaid overtime without saying anything, to make the deadline? On the other hand, how bad would it be for me if I failed to do it on time, when talking about recommendation letters and resumes? They originally thought this project would take 2 days for a full time employee, so they gave me a week to do it. Since I couldn't finish, they gave me an extra week, but mentioned that this was the longest they could give me, because after that my manager (who has to see the project to give his ok) will leave for some time, and we probably won't see each other before the end of my intership. I know I'm a lot behind schedule, and I am fully accepting that it is my fault. I didn't know the programming language very well, so ran into many unexpected problems that I didn't solve fast enough. 

I like Fred Penzel's articles about OCD. Here's a nice starting point: $URL$ Note: I'm not saying you have or don't have OCD. I'm suggesting that you get screened for it; and I think you may find it helpful to learn more about it. When going for an evaluation, it can be helpful to take a filled-out OCD checklist along. This can jump-start the evaluation process. 

I just started a new paralegal job, which I'm really excited about. This represents a career change for me. But I have a big problem. I work closely with one person, let's call her J. When I went for my interview it was in the morning, and I didn't notice any smell of cigarette smoke in the office or when J. was near me. She didn't mention to me that she smokes. However, on the job, I learned that J. steps out for cigarette breaks outdoors and brings the smell of cigarette smoke back in with her on her clothes. As the day progresses and she starts to feel the pressure of work, the frequency of the smoke breaks increases and the smell gets worse. The smell really bothers me. Some of this is subjective, but some is based on observations I've made in the past, that when I'm exposed in this way, I often tend to come down with a respiratory infection, which includes laryngitis, and then I miss some work days (sometimes as much as ten days), and I have a hard time functioning in general. We don't share an office. Our offices are adjoining. If I could convince her to talk to me on the phone, and to use screenshots sent back and forth via email or stored in our networked file sharing system, I think I might be okay. There is an air purifier in a third person's office and I think that moving it into J.'s office would be helpful. On the morning of the first day of work, the head person in the office (the one who has an air purifier in his office) had J. and me meet with him to talk over some logistics of the job. At that time, J. informed me of her custom of taking smoke breaks but emphasized that she never smokes inside. I said I was glad to hear that she always goes outside, given that I am, as I said, "violently allergic to cigarette smoke." So, they both are aware of my sensitivity. I've had an irritated throat for the last few days and even after two days of rest and clean air at home, I have the feeling that my body is struggling with this, and that the jury is still out as to whether the Tuesday, Thursday and Friday exposure last week is going to put me down for the count. Especially with the new exposure coming up this week. I don't know if I have any rights about this, but even if I do, it seems too early to bring up my rights. This firm consists solely of the owner of the air purifier, J, and me. Any suggestions for how to handle this would be much appreciated. I haven't counted the smoke breaks exactly, but I'd guess there are two in the morning and five in the afternoon. I live in the U.S., specifically, upstate New York. I checked what the local health department has published on the subject and have not found that J. is breaking any local ordinance by smoking next to the front or back door. I'm thinking that air purifier might be my salvation, if I can just get her to stop visiting my desk to collaborate about projects we're working on together, when she's just come back in. Edit: More precise information about the layout: There is a long hallway with a front door and a back door. My desk is in a widened part of the hallway, about 2/5 of the way back, opposite the door to the conference room. The first room as one enters the office is the one that currently has the air purifier in it. The second one is J's. (The third is the conference room.) When everyone is in the office, all the doors are open. But as you can see, my office does not have walls or doors. I'm not sure how effective the air purifier would be in my area, but I'm game to try. 

If this is happening to you often (and it sounds like this isn't a one-off) the best thing for you to do is to create your own plan to track your progress through it. If your plan says that X feature should be complete by week 1 and you're approaching the end of week 1, you know you have to get a move on. That should keep you making expected progress throughout rather than the nasty surprise near the end when you realise it's only half done. 

I feel your pain, but just to offer an alternative point of view, I have had many situations when people have emailed me asking for me to perform a task like that and it's incredibly frustrating when they email again 20 minutes later with "please do it, it's delaying us". As a developer, I like to come to the end of a section of code before checking my emails or acting upon them and I'm also in meetings relatively often so emailing me and expecting me to jump on it within 15 minutes is pretty irritating. Now on to my answer. I would suggest having a schedule with them where they do whatever is required of them every day at a specific time. Would that work for you? You can get a fresh build of the code daily and they can schedule it in so that it is not an irritant for them either. Can any of the tasks be automated (by them or you)? 

Have a look at sites like $URL$ There are a lot of resources out there aimed at making it fun to learn to code. Try to find one close to the skills you're using at work and build it from there. Once you've built up some confidence with a technology, come up with a little side product for you to work on at home. Don't choose anything too ambitious, and then use Stack Overflow for specific questions and issues with your project. You'll start to feel more confident in tackling the programming books too after a while. On the other hand, if you try the above and are still feeling like you don't enjoy it, there is nothing wrong with a move to testing. It's a very valid career path, not too badly paid and you are likely to still have chances to dabble in coding if you feel like it. 

Because of a specific bus Schedule, I can either arrive at work at 7h25 or 8h55. Leaving work is a bit more flexible. I do not want to work until 5pm on an average day, so I'm usually aiming for a 7h30-15h30 work day. Very few people actually show up that early, most people seem to like 9-5 more. I personally never call meetings before 9h30 in the morning, because some members of my team would not be there on time. That just seems logical. On the other hand, the "optional" hours at the end of the day (after 3h30pm) don't seem off limits. Many people call meetings during those hours. I guess it's easier to ask someone to stay a bit later today, than it is to figure out how to reach them before they come in to make them get to the office earlier. I'm pretty sure nobody is trying to be inconvenient here. There are meetings at almost any hour of the day. One specific person probably figures "well, 15h30-16h30 is the most convenient, and X won't mind staying a bit later today, he'll have less work to do the rest of the week!". That makes sense. I wouldn't mind every now and then. But in my position, I happen to have to attend meetings with many different groups of people, and of course different meeting organisers. The accumulation of those really screw up my Schedule. Of course, I could just invite some of those people to 7h30am meetings, in a passive-agressive way, but that's really not something I'd be comfortable with doing. There's also the same problem with people who seem to notice when I'm about to leave the office, and choose that specific time to come see me and ask questions about work (that could have been asked earlier or could wait until tomorrow without creating problems), or just to discuss work-related things, which also force me to stay later, while of course the same never happens to them in the morning. So the Question is: How can I politely make people understand that if they aren't willing or able to get to work earlier for some tasks, they shouldn't expect me to stay later for those same tasks? Of course, feel free to tell me if I'm the one being unreasonable. I don't think I am, but I could be wrong. 

For an entry level technical position requiring a bachelor's degree, if HR begins the salary negotiations by stating that there will be a significant increase after six months, and another increase after another six months, what does this mean? Is there a flat general figure, or approximate percentage, you can tell me, based on your observations? Reason for asking: hoping this will help us develop a figure to state during the salary negotiations. Notes: area in question (in the U.S.) has salaries that are slightly below national average; company is in a period of expansion; company currently has about 500 employees. Edit: For the purposes of this question, please assume that the contract, when it gets written, does spell out the two raises. (I have read other threads have made clear that one does have to be careful about that.) My question has to do with trying to calculate backwards to arrive at a figure and a negotiation strategy. (Reason: We are having trouble figuring out what the entry level rate for this type of position is.) 

See your primary medical provider ("GP"?) and get a letter with a diagnosis (e.g. "anxiety disorder"). Take that to your employer and ask for a reasonable accommodation. Here is a site that I think will help you: $URL$ It's based on disability laws in the U.S. but the basic approach should carry over. Take a look at Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP) as a therapeutic technique. This is a long term approach. For example, my son got over a specific phobia using this approach but it took one year to work his way up to the phobia and another to work through the phobia. It's very step by step. I wrote a bit about this therapeutic technique on another SE site. Some people find a high dose of SSRI (ramped up slowly), and a tiny preventive dose (spaced at intervals) of something in the Valium family such as Xanax, helpful in conjunction with the above (both 1 and 2). When I say "tiny," I mean you might need to break the tablets up into quarters or work with a compounding pharmacy to get really small doses that don't leave you too sleepy to work. Medication should of course only be considered through a careful discussion with your medical provider. A GP should be able to screen for OCD and discuss medication options with you. 

The reason your CV isn't giving people the impression you're doing great in your current job is that you don't tell them that! Your list of duties is very terse and tells me nothing about what you have achieved. In fact the word "Duties" implies that you were just doing your job, nothing to see here. Make it "Achievements" or something like that instead. Instead of things like "Configure MySQL database for the SIP infrastructure.", you need to focus on great projects you've done and why you were so effective, what was the end result? Here's a line from the graduate role in my CV: 

Your CV should make people think "wow, he's good" not just "yeah, he's a developer". You come across as an enthusisastic person in your question so inject some of that into your CV. 

I think you're looking at this the wrong way. Your first programming job should be the one where you learn the most. You want to use it to absorb all the knowledge of your colleagues and become a decent programmer in your own right. As long as you're making enough to live off without getting into debt, try not to think too much about the salary, think about everything else you can gain from the job. Later jobs will pay you more for this knowledge. In short, move on when you're not learning very much any more. 

You need to remember what the drawings are for. Yes, a picture can be worth a thousand words, but it can also add nothing. A Venn diagram may communicate something, though not much added value, yet there is no added value at all in drawing a picture of a python after saying you can code. If anything it's confusing. 

When I wanted to do some research, I was able to get a pass to access the local university's libraries for 6 months. Had to go through quite a few checks but it only cost me about £25. This is in the UK though, not sure if it is similar near you but it may be worth a try.
