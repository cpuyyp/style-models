The tapered spacer is usually for water proofing the headset (dust cover), you can remove it as long as there is enough pre-load tension when assemble back the stem. It is actually quiet useful to keep all the dirt and water away, especially if you leave the bike outside the rain. There usually is a set of O-ring(s) inside to keep the water dripping down the steerer tube. 

There are of course combinations of front and rear gear that causes the chain-rub. The general rules are: 

Find the centre of mass of your bike, which is usually just above the BB+downtube. There are two strategies for carrying the bike, assuming that the bike does not have any heavy accessories such as pannier rack+bag, which would otherwise alter the centre of mass of the bike: 

There should be no problem. Just make sure your rear-derailleur shifter is 7-speed. I have use this setup in the past Shimano Exage 300X 7 speed SIS DT shifters Shimano RD-5501 GS 105 9 speed long cage RD SunRace 7 speed HG freewheel 13-28t and it works 

I need to know if this is indeed aluminium? (weight 1.2 kg for 15 inch frame hybrid, is not ferromagnetic). If it is, why would it have a few green/white rust, especially at the weldings/joints? What is the material that has yellow/bronze color outside the frame? Is it a primer? Or anodized? I would really appreciate your help and knowledge on this matter. I would really want to paint it, but I have no idea which primer I need for this frame (aluminium or anodized...) Disclaimer:From other question/answer (I did have a look) I guess it is aluminium, but then the rust and the color does not match Aluminium characteristics and therefore, I would like to ask. 

There is no BB Spacer for a square taper crankset (and is a very bad idea to start). From the image, it looks like you have an (square) ISO crank on an JIS (low profile) spindle. I can see the outer square of the crank was severely deformed. There is not much you can do but to start thinking of changing the crankset, or keep holding on to it til the day it depart. 

Using polishing compound WARNING: if this is your first time tinker with carbon fiber composite, I would recommend you to read up carefully, beside from my general guide in here. a) Use sand paper to lightly sand down the scuff. Make sure you do not sand into the carbon fiber. The sanding would produce black powder if you make this mistake. b) Apply polishing cream/grease to make the surface shiny, with a cloth. Advantage: i) stress-free, ii) simple and quick iii) cheap Disadvantage: i) might require you to re-apply the polishing compound ever 3-6 months. Using epoxy (cold setting, Bisphenol-A-Diglycidylether + Triethylenetetramine) Preparation: Epoxy resin and hardener, release film (or alternatively, electrical tape) a) sand down lightly. Do not sand into the carbon fiber. b) Tape around the tube for both ends of the fixing area, approximately 1.0 cm away from the sanded area. c) Apply the epoxy. Do not smear the epoxy yet. d) Apply release film/electrical tape and use pressure to smear the epoxy over the surface. Advantage: i) gives a very shiny surface if done correctly, ii) permanent surface Disadvantage: i) moderately difficult task, ii) expensive and arduous project 

Just a rough guide, but please make sure you check maximum tyre pressure, then subtract 10% ( just don't do bicycle stunt indoor...) Edit 2: This is for your maximum Cold-Tyre Pressure only. Your target should be within recommended (i.e. Cold-Tyre pressure at recommended pressure and make sure +10% and it should not exceed Maximum pressure). So I believe the answer is 10% more of the recommended pressure would not do any harm if put in the garage (checking a few popular tyre in the shop) ============================= EDIT: I have one tyre blown up when I put close to recommended maximum pressure, and let it exposed to the summer sun locking to the pole. It was the loudest bang I have ever heard.. and I would be extra careful from now and then when pumping an old tyre pass recommended pressure (leave alone the maximum recommended) 

"Ball bearings depend on the continuous presence of a very thin -millionths of an inch - film of lubricant between balls and races, and between the cage, bearing rings, and balls." Pitting happen very often when user over-tighten the hub, or forget to re-adjust the hub between winter/summer (depends on where you live, in Scotland I need to give a proper re-adjustment every half a year); especially from Winter to Summer, if you have the hub adjusted in the winter for good fit. This leads to little/no lubricant between the balls and the hub. Use good quality Ball Bearing Use grease specifically designed for bearings. So that you do not have to service the hub too often I wouldn't go too far before seeing the picture of your cones to see what actually caused the failure of your hub. Could you please upload a picture? EDIT: from the picture, it looks like the cone is either (1) being installed incorrectly (pitting appears only on a particular side), (2) Over-loading or wrong handling, (3)less likely, but I will not rule-out, is that the cone is machined with defects: asymmetrical 

If your headtube is 34mm in diameter then only EC34 Headset can fit in. This means that you can only go as much as 1-1/8 inch fork. Unfortunately there is no conversion kit that I have heard of for adapting 34mm headtube to 1.5 inch steerer. If your headtube is larger than 34 mm, you might have a chance. Take a look at this doc: $URL$ 

If you are looking for pedalling performance, adjusting the seatpost (up and down) and the seat (back and front) is the answer. There are literature about adjusting seatpost so you can look them up on the internet; youtube also have many video demonstration. Adjusting handlebar height is more about efficiency. In general: 

I'm planning to buy an electric bike kit. However, I don't really like adding the display for aesthetic reason. However, the display (either LED or LCD) has function on/off and low/mid/high power on some model and this confuse me. Can I just have BLDC motor, controller, battery, PAS, and brake sensor and hope it will work? 

I have plenty of near-miss incidents. Most of the time I just awkwardly cycling along with the 'near-miss' driver* (urban, so plenty of traffic lights). And it truly feels awkward! This time I tried to approach the driver, just to say if he/she ok. The problem with near-miss is that I am usually shaken, for obvious reason. I believe the driver would feel the same. So I thought it would be best for both to stop and talked about it, make sure that both of us is OK to continue the journey, rather than keep thinking about the incident. One time, the male yells at me I shouldn't be on the road, albeit he was in the wrong?? Another time, the female driver bursts into tears saying sorry?? Is approaching driver after near-miss is a bad idea?? *'Near-miss' drivers in my area are usually considerate, but they are human and prone to making mistakes. If he/she is inconsiderate, I would just shrug it off. This question is not about angry driver at all. 

So the importance of tyre pressure in gaining traction is really minimal in comparison to other factors. It is similar to winter tyre and summer tyre on car, you can get better traction by deflating summer tyre but never get it to be as good as winter one. 

If there is a strong resistance. My guess is that you have a limit screw preventing the fron derailleur shifting to bigger chainring. Check limit screw Check if front derailleur can move freely (unscrew both limit screw and pull the cable to see if front derailleur move). Sometimes front derailleur corrodes to the point that it cannot be moved. 

Well, it depends on type of brake and how fast you would like to stop the bike, at what speed, and at what momentum. If you just want a number to work with (for your home work?), I can give you. A normal cable brake on flat handle bar would need about 40-50 N (3-4 kg) for hard stop, about 20-40N (1-2 kg) for normal deceleration. Same stopping power with drop handlebar and caliper brake would need about 1.5 to 2 times as much (comparing Figure 1 and 2), depends on hand position (leverage). Typically hands at hood position requires more force for same stopping power in comparison to hands at drop position. Same stopping power with hydraulic disc brake needs about 0.5-0.7 fold. This depends on the rotor size/pattern and type of ceramic and thus it is hard to quantify. But the general still holds, if you are designing a disc brake that has an enormous stopping power for normal stopping, you actually degrades the modulation ability of said brake. 

I have seen quiet a few road bike with a Z-shape seat stay until now, e.g. specialized Roubaix Does it serve any purpose? What's the advantage of this design in comparison to a straight-bar seat stay? 

If you are asking only tyre pressure, I would put 90 psi minimum riding it wet condition. Running a lower pressure increase the risk of snake-bite puncture, side wall split/cut. However, more important factors regarding traction upon cornering are: 

Set of Allen (hex) key: usually 4,5 and 6 mm would do the job. You can use these Allen key for disassembling handlebar, stem, seatpost, and most pedals Adjustable wrench or (usually) 15 mm wrench: (check if needed) in order to remove the pedal. You could usually remove the pedal with 8 mm Allen key (sometimes could be 5 mm, 6 mm, or 10 mm). Check if there is a hexagonal recess in the pedal axle (crank side), and better, check the size so that you could buy a correct Allen key. The size would be the distance between two opposite (parallel) flat sides of the hexagonal recess. If it is too much trouble, just buy a set of Allen key from 3-12 mm. It won't cost much. You could remove the wheel simply by hand (check if the wheel is clamped by skewer). 

Bicycle helmet is to protect the head, which has the most important organ in human. You could still live a normal life even with broken/ lost limb(s). But a head injury could change your life forever. A helmet is like a wall between life and death. The priority goes by protecting the most important thing to you first (i.e. your life), not by preventing the most common injury. Having a priority list, you could fulfil the ' safety pyramid' for extra protection, e.g. helmet, arm/leg guard, gloves, boots. However, it is impractical to get a full body armour for just cycling. The risk of body injury that could lead to life and death situation whilst cycling is rather small. Thus, this is often ignored. As Frisbee also mention, the brain is also a very sensitive organ. Yet, a seemingly 'minor' damage to the brain is often lethal. Therefore, the head needs protection, albeit a small possibility. I have witnessed two head injury accidents (while cycling) in my life. One happened a few building block away from my house. It was a classic cornering accident type. The person lost balance (clipped the pavement), and hit her head directly to the pavement (no helmet). She unfortunately pronounced dead at the scene. The second incident happened on the street. The person was riding in a freezing condition. It is with such unfortune that the person lost control on a straight road and hit his head on the raised curb. He is fiancé of my wife's friend. He is still in coma at this moment (since 3 years ago). Needless to say, your argument is flawed. It is similar to a statement that: 'I have never been in an accident that an airbag is activated, so is airbag redundant?' 

This is for the Freewheel (Not Cassette Freehub) swapping problem. I would like to know if it is feasible, regarding the axle breakage. Assuming that I have: 

Always remember, cycling technology is driven by reducing the weight of the bicycle. Having a shaft that weighs half the weight of your bicycle is something you should avoid. These are consideration when building a shaft: 

You could try epoxy as a start (I usually use EpoFix). Remember to: - sand and roughen the contact surface - clean the surface by alcohol to dissolve any grease/oil - mix epoxy and glue the two parts together. - note that if it is your first time mixing epoxy, you might want to practice before making any kind of permanent structure. This epoxy adhesion is plainly for adhesion for obvious reason. Torque and pulling/compressing in the beam axis are ok. However, any extreme bending/loading on lateral direction my cause failure to the adhesion. You could try to patch this up by adding an outer layer of carbon fiber+epoxy (~4 layers) on top of the initial adhesion. This improves the structural characteristics of your joint. If you could advise which part of the bike you are working on, I might be able to give a more detailed answer. 

Ideal Gas equation: pV=nRT With +15oC and -20oC the pressure ratio between the two is: p1/p2 = (273+15)/(273-20). Or 13% higher pressure when put in the garage. However that is assuming you are pumping it to maximum pressure, that the tyre can no longer (or very slightly) expand, making V (volume) constant. That is the basics for your assumption. However, the tyre would flex and expand ever slightly. So, 5-10% would be good approximation to me, depending on how much you put into the tyre, and how big is your tyre. Saving you all the calculation, I would suggest for 

Assuming you are talking about chainring (not sprocket), it should be fine. You should only be worry with an 8- or lower-speed chain on a 9- or more speed freehub. $URL$ 

Ignoring 1, 3rd cause starts to occur at much higher temperature and require time than 2nd cause (which occurs at around 120 oC for moderately contaminated mineral oil*). That is why you need to check your mineral oil before setting out on a trip. Pad fade is the main factor in Mechanical Disc brake fade. Unless you are not braking heavily and continuously for more than 10-20 minutes, you are fine. In number, if you are going down 20% gradient hill, braking continuously to keep your constant speed at 18 kmph (11 mph), the braking power is around 1078 Watts for 110 kg (bike+load+rider). That means, referring to **, you can safely brake for hours, if not hundred of hours for the iceTech. Refer *$URL$ **$URL$ 

This subject is about the performance on a bicycle Cycling is aerobic exercise in nature. 1) Fast twitch vs. Slow twitch muscle In high gear (low cadence and higher force per pedal stroke for the same output, in comparison to higher cadence) you recruit more of your fast-twitch muscle, and thus you are doing more anaerobic (not aerobic) exercise. It's OK if you're going to commute half an hour or so. But if you were to cycling 2 hours upward with some hills, in high gear, I bet all my savings that the next day your body will be in pain because of the built-up lactic acid from anaerobic activity (if you ever finish :D) 2) Blood supply to muscle: As most of your soleus muscle (calf) is slow-twitch type, rich oxygenated blood supply is a must when you exercise. However, if the oxygen supply is insufficient, your muscles will begin converting glucose into lactic acid instead of energy, anaerobic exercise takes over, power output drops and fatigue sets in. Unfortunately, anaerobic exercise can only continue for so long before your muscles run out of energy completely and become fatigued. This is another important reason for pedalling in high-cadence and help the blood supply circulate much more efficiently. 3) The last point I wish to make about high cadence: You can always have a high enough cadence, beyond which, the increase in your output power is minimal in comparison to the increase in your muscle expenditure in energy. Or in another word, it becomes inefficient, just as how an old-fashion electric motor works. 

To my standard, if I kick/push the crank (freewheel direction) as hard as I can and it does not rotate more than 1 rotation after the push, I know that it is time to service. I actually aim for 1.5 to 2 rotations Usually lubing the chain will do the job. This happens after one winter, and the chain usually shows signs of rust. This is on my Cobra steel dutch bike, with partial chain guard. It is my winter bike. So I rarely wash it after rides on rainy winter days. A wash every fortnight/winter would suffice. The idea is that winter bike requires less maintenance in tougher weather condition. So if one have to do a lot of maintenance for a bike in one winter, maybe it's not really meant for winter. Regarding the screws/bolts, I have replaced them all with titanium material. They do corrode, but not as bad. I also put a little lithium grease on them, and by little I mean a very thin coat. The grease never cause me any trouble. Regarding the spokes/nipples/hub, unfortunately there is not much you can do except replacing them when they fail. I heard a rumour from our local bike club that you could grease the spokes/nipples a little and slow down the corrosion. It sounds tedious so I have never tried out.
