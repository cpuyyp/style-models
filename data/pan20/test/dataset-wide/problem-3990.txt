In fact both theorems are true for probability measures on $\mathcal{D}'$ and $\mathcal{S}'$ and they were proved before in the thesis of Xavier Fernique. The paper that came out of it is: "Processus linéaires, processus généralisés". Annales de l'institut Fourier, 17 no. 1 (1967), p. 1-92. 

The space of temperate distributions $S'(\mathbb{R}^d)$ is often equipped with the weak-$\ast$ or with the strong topology. When defining the notion of a probability measure on $S'(\mathbb{R}^d)$, this makes no difference since the corresponding Borel $\sigma$-algebras are the same: see for instance this article by Becnel. However, when it comes to weak convergence of probability measures, the topology cannot be ignored. Even though $S'(\mathbb{R}^d)$ is not a Polish space, I am using the standard definition: $\mu_n\rightarrow \mu$ weakly if for all bounded continuous functions $F:S'(\mathbb{R}^d)\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ one has $$ \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} \int F\ d\mu_n\ =\ \int F\ d\mu\ . $$ My question is: does weak convergence for the weak-$\ast$ topology imply weak convergence for the strong topology? The reason I ask is that the strong topology seems to be the preferred one in the literature on topological vector spaces. On the other hand, the weak-$\ast$ topology is very nice as far as probability theory goes, in particular Prokhorov's Theorem and Levy's Continuity Theorem hold for it. 

Yes this is true and stated as Theorem 14.27 in the book Holomorphy and Calculus in Normed Spaces by Soo Bong Chae. If you need even more sophisticated generalizations, you can also look at the notes related to Section 2.76 on Page 415 of Complex Analysis in Locally Convex Spaces by Seán Dineen 

An excellent introduction for a mathematician without previous exposure to quantum field theory is the book by Gerald Folland: "Quantum field theory, a tourist guide for mathematicians", ISBN: 978-0-8218-4705-3. To understand the standard model, one first needs to learn about quantum field theory, since this is an example of QFT model, although a rather formidable one. I think you will have a hard time finding a more pedagogical introduction to this subject than Folland's book. 

Only a small addendum to the excellent answer by Paul Garrett: A place where the Fourier transform is worked out explicitly (in 1d) is this preprint by Burnol. See in particular Page 13. 

The problem has been solved in the reference indicated in the comment by Vasu Vineet, namely: "Combinatorial Operators for Kronecker Powers of Representations of Sn" by Alain Goupil and Cedric Chauve. However, one cannot say that the formulas in Propositions 1 and 2 of this paper are "nice". 

It seems the author is implicitly using translation invariance so that $$ \langle \sigma_x\rangle_P=\langle s^{-d}\sum_{y}{}^x\ \sigma_y\rangle_{P}\ . $$ Then insert $1=\int \prod_{x'} \lambda_{s} \delta(\lambda_s\sigma_{x'}-s^{-d}\sum_{y}{}^x \sigma_{y}'') d\sigma_{x'}$ in the numerator and denominator of Gibbs expectations, and finally integrate over the original spin field $\sigma$ or $\sigma''$. 

Of course the physics literature is full of references on path integrals. One would not know where to start. Kleinert's books suggested by Alexander must be a good choice. On the rigorous side you might want to have a look at: 

Update: In the trace of five matrices case one can prove nonvanishing as follows. The invariant $L_\lambda$ corresponding to $\lambda=(5)$ is $$ L_{\lambda}(T)=\frac{1}{5!}\sum_{\sigma\in\mathfrak{S}_5} \varepsilon(\sigma)\ {\rm tr}(A^{(\sigma(1))}\cdots A^{(\sigma(5))}) $$ when $T=A^{(1)}\wedge\cdots\wedge A^{(5)}$. Now take the following $5\times 5$ matrices. Let $A^{(1)}_{12}=A^{(1)}_{21}=1$ and all other entries zero. Let $A^{(2)}_{23}=A^{(2)}_{32}=1$ and all other entries zero. Etc. Let $A^{(5)}_{51}=A^{(5)}_{15}=1$ and all other entries zero. Namely, consider the graph given by the cycle $(12345)$. For each edge in the cycle take the adjacency matrix of the corresponding one-edge graph. If I did not mess up my computation, the corresponding specialization of $L_{\lambda}$ is equal to $1/12$. This can be generalized for a partition $\mu$ of $q$, also with distinct parts congruent to 1 mod 4. One then defines an element $T_{\mu}=A^{(1)}\wedge\cdots\wedge A^{(q)}$ as before. Namely, build a graph $G$ with vertex set $\{1,\ldots,q\}$ made of disjoint cycles with lengths given by the parts of $\mu$. For each edge in $G$ build the adjacency matrix of the corresponding one-edge graph to get the $A$ matrices. If one has a part $\mu_a=1$ corresponding to a cycle $(j)$ then take the matrix with $A_{jj}=1$ and all other entries zero. A quick combinatorial argument shows that $L_{\lambda}(T_{\mu})$ is an invertible diagonal matrix (with rows and columns indexed by partitions). By construction products of $A$'s give zero most of the time unless $\lambda$ replicates $\mu$. This immediately implies that $N(q)$ is the exact answer to the OP's question. 

I am currently reading the famous article "Universal Properties of Maps on an Interval" by Collet, Eckmann and Lanford related to the Feigenbaum-Coullet-Tresser universality. I am in particular interested in Theorem 6.3 page 236 in that article. See the article for the precise statement, but very roughly the theorem says: Consider a transformation $T$ on an infinite dimensional space which has a hyperbolic fixed point with one unstable direction with eigenvalue $\delta$ and a codimension one stable manifold. Then there is a change of coordinates to a new system (x,y) where: 

Let $\mu$ denote the centered Gaussian measure on $S'(\mathbb{R}^d)$ with covariance $$ \mathbb{E} [\phi(f)\phi(g)]=\int_{\mathbb{R}^d} \frac{\overline{\widehat{f}(\xi)} \widehat{g}(\xi)}{|\xi|^{d-2[\phi]}}\ d^d\xi $$ where $[\phi]>0$ is just a symbol for a real parameter (minus the Hurst exponent). The above random field is denoted by $FGF_{s}$ with $s=\frac{d}{2}-[\phi]$ in $URL$ If $[\phi]<\frac{d}{2}$ then (via the nuclear theorem) the distribution $C(x,y)=\mathbb{E} [\phi(x)\phi(y)]$ in $S'(\mathbb{R}^{2d})$ is given up to a multiplicative constant $\gamma$ by $$ C(h)=\gamma \int_{\mathbb{R}^{2d}\backslash{\rm Diag}} h(x,y)\ \frac{1}{|x-y|^{2[\phi]}}\ d^dx\ d^d y $$ for all text functions $h\in S(\mathbb{R}^{2d})$. Here ${\rm Diag}$ denotes the diagonal. The space $S'(\mathbb{R}^d)$ is equipped with the weak-$\ast$ topology and the corresponding Borel $\sigma$-algebra. For $U$ an open set in $\mathbb{R}^d$, let $\mathcal{F}(U)$ denote the $\sigma$-algebra generated by the maps $\phi\mapsto \phi(g)$, for $g$ a test function with support in $U$. Let me call a measurable map $\Xi:S'(\mathbb{R}^d)\rightarrow S'(\mathbb{R}^d)$ local if for any open set $U$, and any test function $f$ with support in $U$, the map $\phi\mapsto \Xi(\phi)(f)$ is measurable with respect to $\mathcal{F}(U)$. If $[\phi]>\frac{d}{4}$, is it possible to have the existence of a local map $Sq:S'(\mathbb{R}^d)\rightarrow S'(\mathbb{R}^d)$ for which the random variable $\phi\mapsto Sq(\phi)(f)$ has finite variance and zero expectation for all $f\in S(\mathbb{R}^d)$, and such that the restriction of the covariance $$ \mathbb{E} [Sq(\phi)(f)\ Sq(\phi)(g)] $$ to the complement of the diagonal is given by integration against $$ 2 C(x,y)^2=\frac{2\gamma^2}{|x-y|^{4[\phi]}}\ ? $$ Perhaps a better reformulation of my question is: is there a no-go theorem which rules out the existence of such a "pointwise squaring" map $Sq$? If $[\phi]<\frac{d}{4}$, I believe such a map can be constructed following, e.g., this article by Da Prato and Tubaro. This article by Albeverio and Liang seem to point towards a negative answer as far as the existence of $Sq$. On the other hand this article by Magnen and Unterberger seems to point towards a positive answer. Of course, I did not mean to say that these two articles are contradictory. They apply to questions which are different from (yet related to) the one asked here. If finite variance for $\phi\mapsto Sq(\phi)(f)$ is too much to ask, I would settle for $\phi\mapsto Sq(\phi)(f)Sq(\phi)(g)$ being in $L^1$ if the supports of $f$ and $g$ are disjoint. 

The problem of defining a QFT functional integral is a well posed mathematical problem (see this MO answer for details). In a nutshell, one starts by putting UV and IR cutoffs as is familiar in the theory of Schwartz distributions and one lets bare couplings vary with these cutoffs. The problem is to find the set of all weak limits for the corresponding probability measures on Schwartz distributions. The main difficulty is to construct such weak limit points that are not Gaussian or free measures. One would also like to parametrize this collection of weak limits by a finite number of parameters called renormalized couplings. The main tool to do this is the renormalization group (RG). In this MO answer I briefly explained what the RG is, but I did not give details about how the RG provides a strategy for solving the above problem about weak limit points. For more explanations about this strategy see my article "QFT, RG, and all that, for mathematicians, in eleven pages" and my answer to the physics.stackexchange question Wilsonian definition of renormalizability. What Robert said "I think there is a feeling that the "easy" questions have been answered, and much of what remains may be impossibly hard" is not quite correct. There are plenty of doable problems to work on at present in CQFT other than $YM_4$. For example one has analogous conjectures for the 2d Gross-Neveu model and the 2d $\sigma$-model. These are not impossibly hard like $YM_4$ and they do not really require extraterrestrial "new ideas". As in the millenium problem, what one has to do is a construction of the model without UV cutoffs and in infinite volume together with a proof of mass gap. Another interesting problem (the one I focused on in the above references) is to make contact with conformal field theory. The good class of examples to study in this regard are three-dimensional $N$ component phi-four models with fractional Laplacian $(-\Delta)^{\alpha}$ in the kinetic term. The cases $N=1$, $\alpha=\frac{3}{4}+\epsilon$ as well as $N$ large, $\alpha=1$ should be not be impossibly hard. Other problems of current interest are: proving the operator product expansion and conformal invariance using the RG. As for what I personally think is most important problem in constructive quantum field theory today, it is to develop a rigorous Wilsonian RG formalism for handling space-dependent couplings. Question B: This one is not moot. It is a fact that there are more mathematicians working on the topological aspects of QFT rather than its analytical aspects. I think this state of affairs is simply due to the status quo, i.e., it's just the way things are. With regards to the North American situation in particular, I think the main explanation is that if a graduate student would like to work on the analysis of QFT, chances are there would simply be nobody in their department to teach them the subject to the point of being research-ready. I think there is nothing more to it, but this could change in the future. 

Just a small bibliographical complement to the very nice answers already given. The identity of the two $\sigma$-algebras is proven in Proposition 2.1 of the article An investigation of the properties of generalized Gaussian random fields 

Maybe you need the theory of cumulants also called semi-invariants. For two random variables $X,Y$ the correlation (or second cumulant) is $v(X,Y)=E(XY)-E(X)E(Y)$ where $E$ denotes the expectation. Pearson's formula makes a dimensionless quantity $$r=\frac{v(X,Y)}{\sqrt{v(X,X) v(Y,Y)}}\ ,$$ i.e., $X$ and $Y$ might have units like centimeters but $r$ is a pure number. The third cumulant generalizes $v(X,Y)$ and measures a correlation of three variables `altogether', i.e., not indirectly resulting from their pairwise correlations. It is $$ c(X,Y,Z)=E(XYZ)-E(X)E(YZ)-E(Y)E(XZ)-E(Z)E(XY) $$ $$ +2E(X)E(Y)E(Z). $$ However I don't know what the natural or standard dimensionless analog of $r$ would be. A possibility is $$ \frac{c(X,Y,Z)}{\sqrt{v(X,X)v(Y,Y)v(Z,Z)}}. $$ All this is about random variables, say discrete given by a finite sample $(x_i,y_i,z_i)$, $1\le i\le N$. Now in statistical estimation you might have things like $1/N$ turning into $1/(N-1)$ in the correct formulas to use.
