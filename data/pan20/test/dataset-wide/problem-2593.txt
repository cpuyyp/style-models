One could say that the meaning of the word Dhamma is related to the word Concept. The concept of "Nibbana" would therefore exist until all temporary realities cease, then what was conceptualized will be known as it is and known to not have the characteristics suffering, being discerned as ultimate peace and happiness. The thinking about it and the Idea has characteristic of suffering because it only temporarily gains footing in the system in which all is happening. The concept is not the real thing if u know what i mean. So nibbana as a concept is in that sense a formed idea therefore will change, gaining temporary existence in a system. Nibbana as a reality is a possible state of the system, a state in which existence and matter gain no footing, this is brought about by tweaking the states of energy and information existing within the system. 

Question does not apply. Nibbana is unconditioned, uncaused, unmade. The proper question would be what are the conditions for cessation of All/aggrigates 

My guess is that a Sotapan would look into alternative removal of the worm but eventually probably get rid of it one way or another. 

What is dangerous that is harmful, stressful, undesired. What one is averse to that is perceived as stressful, undesired and harmful. Difference is that Aversion is to be uprooted as Defilement, Danger is to be avoided. Seem to me that it is a matter of evaluating the object of referrence, in this case the relationship. Does OP rightfully perceive danger? It is perceived as abusive by OP, if OP s perception is well developed as in he is a wise & well-discerning person then definitely he should run away once he starts perceiving the danger in such association. It would be like seeing a punch coming and not moving away, you dont have to but all things considered you probably better off moving. One who has a relationship has worry about relationship. When there is no relationship, there can be no abuse of that sort. 

Else? For developing of non-distractiveness association with people collected in mind, avoiding restless people and mindfulness of arising and ceasing of phenomena in general according to Buddhagosa s commentary I think this is it for your concentration problem OP, dont think i have to state the seemingly obvious in regards to your leaks:) In regards to feeling inferior, 

When in Coma it is not unconditioned, because it has being in coma as condition. Nibbana is not detachment from the world because is not detachment of something from something. If one is similar to the other in the aspect of detaching from the world, i dont think it can be rightfully be said to be so but maybe in some context. Nibbana is when suffering or anything that has the quality of suffering, impermanence, uncontrollability and stress does not gain footing. Gelañña Sutta: "... "Just as an oil lamp burns in dependence on oil & wick; and from the termination of the oil & wick — and from not being provided any other sustenance — it goes out unnourished; in the same way, when sensing a feeling limited to the body, he discerns that 'I am sensing a feeling limited to the body.' When sensing a feeling limited to life, he discerns that 'I am sensing a feeling limited to life.' He discerns that 'With the break-up of the body, after the termination of life, all that is sensed, not being relished, will grow cold right here.'" In case of a coma that state is brought about by putting a person in coma. One could seemingly say the same about Nibbana as being brought about by doing the 8FNP but that is a fallacy because 8FNP is to cessation of [suffering], not the Arising of something. Also when someone is in coma, i assume, his faculties will be dull, whilst someone who has entered the cessation will have exceptionally clear faculties. 

So there it is very safe to say based on the Sutta Pitaka alone that there are Noble People who have not realized Nibbana and the Three Fetters but have Right View, wereas the other becomes fixed in Right View. 

That being said it is possible to feel an unpleasant feeling of the flesh without feeling an unplesant feeling not of the flesh. 

Try rather to catch urself in the process of thinking about yourself, that is thinking. If one grouped all thoughts and ideas into one cathegory and called it all "thinking" one could see that the idea of self etc it is merely an idea, a concept that exists in the thinking faculty, just like forms and colors exist when there is seeing, so does ideas of self when there is thinking. The Buddha was perfect in conduct, that implies verbal conduct too. He talk very well and used personal pronounce perfectly too, he would not have talked in english but for translations they put enlighs I, Me and etc. So avoiding words is probably not something useful to adapt and was never recommended by the Buddha afaik. if anything i heard a good disciple is skilled in words and their use, so probably studying linguistics and general semantics is a better practice. 

I might get into trouble but imho fwiw; "Hinduism" - Bunch of teachers more or less teaching Samatha Meditation, beliefs are traced to those meditative attainments and the interpretation of those. "Buddhism" - Bunch of teachers more or less teaching based on the teachings of a Perfect being who fully explained the Samatha techniques and attainments and discovered a higher meditative state than what was not previously known to "Hindu teachers". The practice leading to that exalted state is called the "8 Fold Path". If you have confidence in that meditation techniques allow one to reach the special states and that one can learn valuable lessons from these experiences that would make one more or less of a Hindu or Buddhist depending on the level learning, poundering with reason, coming to agreement and personal verification. In regards to rebirth and other claims like that depend on conviction a lot so as i see it they dont really make or break a "buddhist" as most Buddhists have skeptical doubt periodically. Id recommend taking a look at Brahmajāla Sutta: The All-embracing Net of Views $URL$ It is quite dense but im sure it will be illuminating. 

You are learning that breath is unstable, mind is unstable, you cant just look at the breath. There is a lesson here. 

As i see it, as an ascetic one has no interest in anything else than realizing the Dhamma. If say one in training decides to practice extreme asceticism to starvation for reasons other than thinking that it is great thing to do but maybe circumstances make one choose between a livelihood that severely impairs the practice or starvation one could make a case for it being at least seemingly a better option relatively speaking, i dont think it is optimal but it is always an alternative. One has some 1-2 months or even more if one brings stored food to get as much work done as possible. I mean that it is in a way a burden to not sever the connection to laylife completely. More to illustrate if say one person became got some attainments in time when and where it is prosecuted and given the option to go his own way or to be hindered by circumstances. He might choose to just go do his thing and not teach anybody anything.
