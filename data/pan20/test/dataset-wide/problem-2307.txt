Those grackles are engaged in a courting behavior, most frequently called “bill tilt.” It's also been called “head up” or “head up threat.” While establishing pairs for mating, males vie for the attention of the females. Usually as the birds arrive, a group of males will chase the females. Gradually the males drop off until there are fewer males vying for the attention of each female. Once they settle in at the feeding and nesting areas, the males begin the process of establishing dominance, thus increasing their chance of attracting the specific female who'll become his mate. The males won't do the head tilt unless at least one other male and one female is present. The females may also do the head tilt, but once the pair is established, they both discontinue it. In each group, the male who can tilt his head farthest back and hold it the longest is considered dominant and the other males respect that. Although the grackles may engage in some physical sparring behavior to establish dominance, much of that is avoided by this behavior. From page 208 of Stokes Backyard Bird Book: The Complete Guide to Attracting, Identifying and understanding the birds in your back yard.: 

Oars are used primarily for rowboats and sculls, although there are other popular oar-driven vessels. Paddles are used primarily for canoes and kayaks. Paddle design even differs between canoes and kayaks. Canoe paddles have long handles with one blade on the end. Kayak paddles have blades on both ends. Oars are attached to the boat using oarlocks, which come in many shapes and sizes, and can be adapted for a number of different types of boats. Because they're attached, the motion of oars is controlled by the legs, knees and arms. Paddles are not attached to the boat, so they're held by the hand, or both hands, depending on the situation. The strokes of a paddle are controlled by the user's torso. Both oars and paddles are made in a number of different materials. Varieties include wood, fiberglass, plastic, as well as nylon and composites. They also both come in different sizes, shapes and designs. They're tailored to the size of the user, the number of users per craft, and the shape or purpose of the boat. Paddles and Oars offers information, descriptions, pictures and recommendations for choosing which works best in any given situation. My thanks go to @Erik for providing additional pertinent information regarding oars: 

The article references work done by Nikolaas Tinbergen, a Dutch ethologist and ornithologist, who earned a Nobel Price for his work in animal behavior. Tinbergen believes four questions that are asked of any animal behaviour can be applied to this observed behaviour of the seagull dance. His belief is that every behavior has a cause, development, evolution and function. 

The sounds are described and Illustrated in Peterson's Field Guide to Bird Sounds of North America Interestingly, the specific calls will be used between males and females or males and males while in a group. Much like the head tilt, the male uses it only in the presence of other males. Once he has found a mate, he doesn't use either again, and neither does she. 

To determine what to avoid, agreement across sources is that insects which are brightly colored, furry, or have a strong smell, should be avoided. The color can be a signal to predators that they contain poisons, which would also be toxic to us. They also tend to be the insects with stingers, including ants. Even if they're safe to eat, we can get hurt in the process. Secrets of Survival offers a good summation: 

Squirrels bury nuts for future consumption, sometimes many months away. I recently learned that tree squirrels, including Eastern grey squirrels, sometimes dig empty holes, pretend to drop nuts in them, then cover them back up. It's a behavior which is generally called either "tactical deception" or "deceptive caching." It takes place in all squirrel habitats, including backyards, forests, and anyplace where food is available. Squirrels do this so that other squirrels, or nut-loving animals, will spend time digging in a recognizable hole, only to find it empty. If squirrels can be deceived in this way, then how do they know where nuts really are? There has to be something to it other than random digging, which seems especially hard to believe in large forests. How do squirrels actually find nuts, either buried by themselves or by others? 

If the birds, even when not breeding, haven't moved away on their own, you can seek removal or relocation assistance, however, and this is very important: Never try to remove or relocate even one of these birds, either on your own, or by calling a "relocation specialist" People advertise themselves as "certified" or "licensed" in order to make money, so be careful when seeking help. Only people with certification from the Environmental Protection Agency are authorized to help, and there's a strict process they need to go through to receive the proper certification. 

Presenting most frequently as either a vine or bush, it can also be tree-like with a thick stem, growing to 9 or 10 feet tall. As with others in the family, the most tell-tale sign is leaves grouped together in threes, called leaflets, the middle being the longest. They're green throughout the summer, turning red in the fall. The leaves are often, but not always, shaped like those of a regular oak tree, although it's actually a member of the cashew, not the oak, family. Also, it's technically allergenic, not poisonous, which makes it less dangerous, though not necessarily less uncomfortable, than some other plants! The Sure-Fire Poison Oak and Poison Ivy Identification System is an extremely comprehensive 14-page booklet, with detailed information about the various types of poisonous plants; instructions for discerning their characteristics; drawings; and location maps. Unfortunately, your pictures appear to match many of the criteria: 

I've been told that the only place Emperor penguins live is Antarctica. They live in colonies which can be anywhere from 500-20,000 birds. Unlike some other birds, including other penguin species, they only lay one egg at a time, and on ice rather than land. Thousands of people travel to Antarctica each year hoping to see the Emperors. Excursions take place in the form of cruises, airplanes, and helicopters, combined with long walks and camping. Those who've gone report that it's an absolutely magnificent and unforgettable experience. Since each pair only has one egg per breeding season, if I were fortunate enough to witness these penguins during the incubation period, would I see males, females, or a combination of both? Also, in order to plan the trip, how long of a window would I have, meaning what's the length of the incubation period? 

Judging by when the article was written, he would have been referring to the years 2012 and 2013. As for why they wash up on the beach, it's usually because they're deceased. Sand dollars live in the subtidal zone, which is an area close to the water's edge. It's shallow, but not visible, even at low tide. Most of the time they're submerged in the sand on their side, though sometimes they're lying flat. Here's a good description from the Monterey Bay Aquarium. 

Conservation: (I'm adding this because you said you like him, and because I like him!) The grey partridge is "Globally Threatened" and has had a "Severe Decline" in its appearance in the UK over the last few decades. As I mentioned earlier, the primary problem is destruction of their habitat, so they have less to eat and fewer good nesting places. This is happening for many reasons. The Game and Wildlife Conservation Trust (GWCT) is working with the British Government to create ways to bring back the grey partridge population. I encourage you to check out their long term monitoring project called the Partridge Count Scheme. They use information from all available sources to try and help in the fight, and ask anyone to please report sightings, including you! Even your one little bird visit will make a difference for the future of these guys. 

Here's another example of what a boat plate can look like, with the same accompanying text: Source This one's not easy to read, but it's interesting to look at: 

What you're seeing is a huge washing up of tuna crabs, Pleuroncodes planipes, which has created "red beach" all up and down the California shoreline, as well as other states. It's not an uncommon occurrence farther South, and is quite frequent in Baja and along the Mexican coast. There are some interesting scientific theories as to the cause, the changing weather and tide patterns caused by El Nino being one of them. Although the most recent large scale event in your area was the first since 1983, you'd be interested to know that the species itself was first discovered right there in Monterey Bay!

It's also extremely important to crush peanuts. More than one source said that mother birds may grab peanuts whole and try to stuff them down the throats of their young, choking them in the process. 

When I was younger, during the late 1960's and 1970's, my Dad had a personal-size sailboat, called the Sunfish. He loved it because it was lightweight, easy to sail on his own, and had room to include a few young children if we wanted to go with him. It was also easy to right by himself after capsizing, which we frequently did on purpose just for fun. We used it regularly, on freshwater lakes and ponds throughout Massachusetts, where we lived. I would call him an accomplished solo sailor. Each year during that same time period, we spent the month of August in Nantucket, an Island about 30 miles off the coast of Cape Cod. Almost every day we sailed throughout the ocean waters of the region. Some areas were calm, and others were quite choppy and rough. One day while he was out in the Sound by himself, a thunderstorm, including lightning, arose. He wanted to wait it out, but the Coast Guard spotted him. They brought him in, impounded the boat, and he had to pay a fine to get it back. I don't know if there were actual written rules he didn't follow, or if the Coast Guard just considered him a danger to himself, or a reckless person, and reacted accordingly. What are the current rules in 2017? Can a Sunfish be sailed during a thunderstorm in waters off the Massachusetts/Cape Cod region? Is a permit required? Are there separate rules because of its design or weight class, or are the rules the same regardless of the size or type of boat? If this question is easier to answer without it being specific to Massachusetts, that's fine. I just didn't want to make it too broad, especially since rules may vary from state to state. Feel free to expand it to increase the amount of useful information for the community. 

When checking to find out what kind of earthworm we might be discussing, I found sources listing anywhere from 100 to over 6,000 species. That wasn't very helpful so I'll just skip it and assume you have some common variety of earthworm that's present around many parts of the world! The short answer here is that they were most likely trying to get to a place where they could dig a tunnel, and succumbed to the elements along the way. The actual elements, however, may not be exactly what we had in mind. It doesn't sound like it got cold enough to freeze them, so I doubt that's why they died. (An interesting fact from here is that earthworms can freeze solid and still live if the freeze is slow and they do not thaw out and refreeze often. I don't think that applies here, though!) Likely it was a combination of things, including a few that DudeOnRock already mentioned. Earthworms always have tunnels, but as the weather gets cooler, they dig deeper and wider in preparation for the winter. A quick temperature drop can cause them to come out for a short while instead. They don't come looking for warmth, though, but as a mission to find a different place in your yard to dig more trails and hunker down for the winter. They may also grab some snacks, like bugs, along the way, to give them energy for the cold weather to come. Your stones are pretty tight, but there may have been something in the crevices that they wanted to eat. The most common cause of environmental earthworm death is dryness, and I think that's the bottom line here. Something happened along the way which caused them to dry out, which resulted in their demise. Earthworms breathe, meaning get oxygen, through their skin. Without enough oxygen, they literally suffocate. In order to absorb the oxygen, however, they must be wet all of the time. This explains the coating of slime (mucus). It's protective. 

Dr. David Adams, a dermatologist at Penn State in Hershey, Pennsylvania, puts the resistant figure at around 25%. He's quoted in an article published in Science Daily in July, 2015: 

I live in the Northeast United States. We have a lot of evergreens, other trees and bushes in the yard, so there are birds and squirrels here year-round. Nature provides much of their diet, and we provide supplementary food, and also make sure they have water. We take our part seriously. We have lots of birdbaths, and keeping water thawed isn't easy. We crack ice out and refill them on a regular basis, but we'd like a heated one that will keep the water thawed by itself. I've been looking online and found some that are controlled by thermostats. The most common turn on when the water begins to freeze, raise it to 35°F, and shut off when it gets warmer. They're rated to -10° or lower. They have electrical cords underneath, and are made to attach to extension cords too. This type looks good to us, as long as it's guaranteed for electrical safety and accurate temperature. They come in either one-piece or two piece, with different types of edges around the rim. We want something that the birds can stand on without slipping, no matter what the weather conditions. We want it made out of something that won't crack under the weight of heavy snow or ice. We don't want weather or animals to be able to knock it over. We'd like something that is easy to clean. We definitely want something with a written warranty to cover all of the above criteria. Which type of free-standing, thermostatically-controlled birdbaths would meet our most important criteria?
