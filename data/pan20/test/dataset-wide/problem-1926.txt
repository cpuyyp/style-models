In Illinois, the "official" way to find the "official" address of a business appears to depend how the business was organized. That is, the business could just be someone operating under an assumed name, or it could be a corporation, or it could be a limited liability company, etc. For an assumed name, the name and address must be registered with the county. See (805 ILCS 405/) Assumed Business Name Act. A corporation must have a registered office in the state. See (805 ILCS 5/) Business Corporation Act of 1983. The laws pertaining to other business organizations appear similar, and it looks like you can find a whole list of them in the Illinois Compiled Statutes. The link lists the laws pertaining to the various business organizations in about as clean a format as I have seen. Now, it appears that the Illinois Secretary of State has a page allowing you to search for information about a corporation or LLC. However, since assumed names are just registered with the county in Illinois, you would have to find the county administration offices to get that information. Finally, if the business is in violation of the registered address laws, you may have to discuss with a (perhaps different) lawyer how to serve them. In Minnesota, it is permissible to serve process on the Secretary of State for certain similar circumstances, but I do not know whether such a mechanism exists in Illinois. 

Recruiter here with 15 years of experience. You absolutely want to tell the recruiters you have worked with as soon as possible that you have accepted a position. Chances are the recruiter will ask questions and perhaps try to sway your decision, and since recruiters only get paid for making a placement, there is even a chance that the recruiter will go back to the companies that presented offers to see if they will sweeten the pot a bit and up the offer. If you are 100% decided on accepting one offer, be firm with the recruiters and let them know that you have passed on your commitment to your new employer. Be sure to thank them for their time, and if they treated you well you may want to let them know that you would pass their name along to anyone that you knew was looking for work. Recruiters love referrals, and you don't want to burn any bridges with the recruiter or the hiring companies themselves. You could ask the recruiters if they object to you reaching out directly to the hiring companies with a call/email to thank them for their time and for their consideration. I would have no problem with allowing my candidates to follow-up after declining an offer, but some might have an issue with it (the recruiters that have an issue are the ones you should worry about, and you may be more inclined to contact those particular companies directly). The appropriate person to address the letter to would be the interview team, and HR as well if you had a fair amount of contact with them during the offer process. 

Taking at face value your assertion that this employee's participation and presence is required for every topic under discussion at the meeting, I would have little to add to the other answers. However, there are a couple considerations from the employee's perspective: 

I have a software product that may have some appeal to a relatively small, vertical market. I am considering hiring a salesperson part-time (which can be in addition to the salesperson's other work provided that there are no conflicts of interest) to sell this product, customizations to the product, etc. What should I look for in such a salesperson? 

I am aware of sites such as salary.com for finding traditional salaries. How can I find a reliable source for average sales commission rates for my area, industry, etc.? What factors would influence the average rate? Google has not yet given me anything vaguely complete or reliable so far. My perspective is that of a small business owner who might hire a salesperson. 

Are there additional tasks in your workload? Make a quick list. For this answer, I will presume that the list above represents your complete workload. Given that spending time on one task takes time away from other tasks, it is important to the business that the most important business priorities are delivered the fastest. In an abstract sense, the task with the highest business value (highest profit, regulatory benefit, cost savings, etc.) and the least cost (delivered in a shorter timeframe, purchased off-the-shelf versus development in-house, etc.) is the task that should be accomplished first. Usually -- as I believe is the case here -- the value vs. cost is not entirely clear. Fortunately, you don't have to rank all your tasks this way, since business priorities change all the time. Just rank the top few. In a more practical sense, I would recommend: Organize your thoughts and tasks. Look at your task list. Are there tasks (such as lower-priority defects with the internal website) that can be delayed until after the launch of the two websites? Are there parts of tasks that can be reused, especially between the two websites? Are there libraries (free or paid) that may solve parts of your problem for you? Don't spend much time on this effort, but even a few minutes organizing this list will help you have a conversation with the business stakeholders. Get agreement on business priorities for your tasks Now that you have a list, find out which tasks in your workload have the most business value from the perspective of your management. This means asking your manager -- and anyone else your manager believes should be involved -- to decide which tasks in your workload take priority over the others. In your situation, the two questions I would most likely raise are: 

What are you not certain about? You say both offer and company are good, so you need to decide what exactly you are waiting for in the job search. Of course something better could always come around, but will it? Some candidates do not want to take the first job offer given (using the 'don't buy the first car you test drive' theory), but what if that offer is indeed the best? 

I think the key here is 'considering'. If the parties who scheduled the interview were absolutely aware that these interviewers were active candidates for the job, or if they were aware that these interviewers were even considering throwing their hats into the ring, then I would expect they would/should not be involved in the process. This is also assuming that the company has a large enough number of employees to choose from for the interview panel. At a smaller company, there may be few options. As others have mentioned, going to HR is another option. Depending on the size of the company, you may want to be careful about that, as you may be seen as someone who is 'telling' on your competitors before anything has even happened. If the other candidates have not come forward yet and you only know they are considering applying from personal conversations, I'd be careful with what you say at this point. Good luck! 

From these questions, gain agreement on which work is to be done first. If production support issues are the most important, they get done first. If some production support issues can wait until after one website or both websites are done, work on the websites first. Important: "agreement" does not mean "set in stone." Business priorities can and do change all the time. As long as you recognize and the business stakeholders recognize that changes come with a cost, if your manager (or other "boss") changes your priorities, and you have advised the business on the cost, then your priorities have changed. Keep the business updated at least daily on your progress This doesn't need to take long. A quick e-mail should suffice. Raise any new issues that someone else could reasonably help you resolve. If you are waiting to get a question answered, work on your next priority That way, you are continuing to make progress. Don't push yourself past your level of productivity You have a job that requires you to think -- or at least, we hope so. It does no one any good for you to keep working when you are too tired to continue. Get some rest and come back the next day, rested and ready to work. You are in a tough situation. You may or may not get everything done that the business wants. But -- the business is almost certainly better off if you deliver something usable. If you can get your first website done in a little under half the time allotted -- or at least the most important, usable parts of that first website -- you are in a great position to reassess the situation with the business. Good luck to you. Many of us have been in situations like this, and while you cannot and should not constantly work in crisis mode, know that you can survive this ordeal and maybe demonstrate more worth to this employer -- or a more reasonable, future one. 

Recruiter here. When I coach candidates on salary negotiation, I always tell them that they are free to speak to the client directly about compensation if they want, but to keep in mind that any number they throw out puts a relatively hard cap on what I can get you. If you list 70K as your desired salary, chances are they will offer a bit less (sometimes, but rarely more), and it will be difficult for me to ask for 73 at that point. Assuming you are not working with a recruiter, you don't have an intermediary or an agent in your negotiations other than yourself. Some of the examples above about insurance contribution being higher than expected or 401k or target bonus being lower than expected are possibilities. Being offered less vacation time that you currently have or than you expected is also an easy one, as vacation days have a quantifiable value (to spitball some numbers, there are 52 weeks x 5 = 260 weekdays/year, subtract say 10 holidays = 250 working days a year, so every 5 day week you work = 2% of salary). The example about commute distance could make you look a bit unprofessional, as in most situations you probably knew the location of the job before you interviewed and applied for it. The other examples about asking for more bonus, extra vacation time, or to change the 401k vesting schedule are not entirely realistic in most cases. Larger companies will probably laugh at the suggestion, small companies may be able to accommodate bonus or vacation but probably not changing a 401k schedule. One valid reason that some candidates will give to increase the requested compensation is a higher responsibility level or work expectation than you expected. Companies will know that if you apply for a job with say no leadership role and they ask you to lead a team, you may want to be compensated for that responsibility. 

These factors add up to the next three weeks being great real-world experience you can use both in this job and when interviewing for future jobs. Now: most managers, in my experience, do understand that your time comes with tradeoffs. In other words, if you are spending time on one task, you are not spending that time on another task. You seem to characterize your current workload as: 

Although it is possible that none of these items apply, it may be worth considering whether the employee thinks they do and addressing her misconception from that perspective. 

Production support ("we have just released on production our new internal website and we are constantly running on bugs related to it"); and Creation of two websites in a rapid timeframe ("I have been given the task to complete two websites in twenty-one days") 

You may have an interesting opportunity here, actually, though it may be tough to perceive this opportunity through the pressure you feel. Why? 

Her presence may not truly be as required as you think it is, and she knows it. I have no way of knowing whether this is the case. However, she may not feel comfortable telling you her presence at the meeting is not beneficial to your organization. Her presence and participation truly are required at least some of the time. However, she may feel she is having trouble meeting deadlines or taking time away from other parts of her job for the meeting. If that is the case, it may be beneficial to work with her to determine what the roadblock is. If it is possible that she needs to be present for questions, she could be less disruptive by attending the meeting remotely, even if she is actually in the office. We do this all the time at my current client's office: for example, software developers working on one of the major business projects are part of the weekly status meeting for the project, but they typically remain in their cubes (or remote, if necessary) with the headset on, listening for questions to answer. That way, the development work does not disturb the meeting. 

This problem isn't about you, it is a problem with the company that frankly you should not want to deal with. Some extra hours during crunch time in software product development are expected, but what you are describing are sweatshop conditions that should be unacceptable to most engineers. If a company is asking or demanding employees to work 80 hours a week, the problem is that the company needs more engineers. What probably happened here is that the company underestimated the amount of time and effort would go into this project, and they are trying to make up for it. Paying engineers some amount for overtime worked is a nice gesture, but to expect employees to be available for 80+ hours a week is simply not sustainable for that period of time. If you are new to the business you may not know this yet, but I would say you could probably make the same amount of money and work half the hours. Other than the fact that you are burning out, you mentioned poor software quality. It is one thing to work long hours and to sweat for a product development effort that is incredibly successful, but exerting this much of your time into something that appears to be a failure at this point is a bigger issue for your career. This company's business model is unsustainable, and you will see turnover continuing which means fewer mentors to choose from for a young engineer like yourself. Find a company with a more reasonable work schedule. 

You are in a position of real responsibility, in essence serving as a lead developer. You may have more influence than it seems. You recognize your current limits and know that you have more to learn. 

Which production support issues have a higher priority than the two websites, and which production support issues can wait? It helps if you can help to identify temporary workarounds for more minor issues. It also helps if you have anyone else in the business who is able to triage the production support issues for severity so that you don't have to do it yourself. Of the two websites, which one is more important? Yes, yes, they're both important. But, pretend that only one could be done. Which would it be? 

It's been my experience that knowledge workers don't like being dictated to about policies for which they see no purpose. You do state a purpose, but the employees you are managing seem to think it is not a good one. Further, there are probably alternatives that you have not considered, and given what sounds like an issue being "dictated from above," your employees may either not have thought of them, do not feel comfortable proposing them, or feel that they would simply be shot down. If the only reason you are implementing the policy is because of tension with people in other departments, it's your job to manage that tension so that your people can work most effectively. I don't think that's the only reason, though. For example, what if a developer is needed to fix an urgent production issue that happens at 8:00 or 9:00 or whatever other time? However, it is unlikely that you need all your developers present to fix that issue. What if you had a rotating (unless someone volunteers) "early" schedule, so that each developer takes a turn being required to be there at 8:00 (or 9:00, etc.)? That solution seems more likely to satisfy both the business needs and the desires of your employees. Everyone "shares the pain" (or inflicts it on someone who doesn't mind it). People can come in and work most of the time when they feel they would be most productive. This is just one possibility, but it may generate discussion with your employees about how to solve the real problems and satisfy everyone's interests here. If you choose to go down the more disciplinary route, and the "start time" issue truly is important to your developers, you will lose your good ones to other employment. Your employees are likely to feel insecure in their jobs (what if some real emergency actually happens one day to make someone late?). Further, this can be seen as a shift in management in the wrong direction (from your employees' perspective), since they did previously have experience working under someone else. It's up to you, of course, but I would urge you to take a step back and try harder to see the situation from your employees' perspective. You have a job to do, of course, but I think there are solutions that better satisfy everyone's interests than the one you are proposing.
