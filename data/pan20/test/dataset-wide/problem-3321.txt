(First, an apology: I don't speak Spanish, and ran your question through Google Translate to understand it. So I may be misinterpreting things.) If I understand right, what you're asking is: "is there any neurological evidence to support Saussure's theory of the signifier and the signified?" In other words, is there neurological support for the idea that we store words separately from the concepts they represent, with links between them? I don't know of any neurological evidence, but there is some psychological evidence for it. In particular, "priming" works on both levels. When someone is shown a series of letters (or played a series of phones), and told to determine whether it's a valid English word or not, they'll react more quickly and more accurately if the word has been "primed" in their mind first. You can "prime" a word by saying something that sounds similar (a similar signifier), or something with a similar meaning (a similar signified). This is usually taken as evidence that we store words both by their sound and by their meaning: we have a section of our brain that stores sequences of phonemes, sorted in some way, and a section of our brains that stores semantic concepts ("lemmas"), sorted in some other way. And words are stored as links between these two data structures. 

To supplement Nick's excellent answer: The mainstream view of PIE now is that it had no /a/ vowel (in the oldest stages we can reconstruct). Instead, it had three(*) "laryngeal" sounds, which weren't actually particularly laryngeal, but the name has stuck. They're conventionally written *h₁ *h₂ *h₃ and there are various theories as to their actual pronunciation: personally, I like the idea that they were /h x ɣʷ/, but there's not enough evidence to be sure. (*) Some people suggest that there were four or even five, but this hasn't caught on. But in every Indo-European language known at the time(**), these "laryngeals" never appeared directly. Instead, they only appeared as a "color" on the surrounding vowels. In other words, *h₁ *h₂ *h₃ first affected the surrounding vowels, then disappeared entirely. (**) Hittite was discovered after the laryngeal theory was proposed, and did actually show direct evidence of some laryngeals. Which adds quite a lot of evidence to the theory. In particular, *h₁ turned *e into *e (no change), *h₂ turned *e into *a, and *h₃ turned *e into *o. If the laryngeal came before the vowel, the result was short; if it came after the vowel, the result was long. So Wiktionary is showing the (more modern) reconstruction of older PIE, while the laryngeals still existed, and Etymonline is showing the (older) reconstruction of later PIE, after Hittite split off and the laryngeals vanished. Note, as the others have said, that Etymonline is also ignoring several important distinctions in PIE: *ǵ and *g are separate phonemes in every reconstruction I've seen, and there's significantly more evidence for them than there is for laryngeals. (See the centum-satem division for examples.) 

I think the unmarked forms of the pronouns survive in their quite particlar context (as the entire subject of an overt finite verb) because this context occurs very frequently in language, i.e. subject + finite verb, more frequently than perhaps any other syntactic construction. 

Sentence 1b is strongly marked; it needs a quite special context for it to occur, but given this context, it can be acceptable. It involves copular inversion; the subject NP has inverted to the other side of the finite verb, forcing the predicative adjective to appear in first position. Copular inversion in English is a remnant of the V2 principle of Germanic languages. Now with examples 1a-b in mind, consider the following sentences: 

The terminology in this area was established in the 1960s and 1970s, during the heyday of Transformational Grammar. At that time, the "base" denoted deep syntactic structure (D-structure), as opposed to surface syntactic structure (S-structure). The specific architecture of the syntax in the theory has long since been revamped entirely, but the terminology from that era remains. Modern syntax still uses terminology such as "base generated" or "base position" when it wants to acknowledge that a given constituent is in a derived position, meaning that it has been moved or copied into its surface position. Modern GB (Government and Binding) and MP (Minimalist Program) theory do not, however, acknowledge deep structure in the sense that it was understood when "base component" was a clear reference to deep structure. My understanding of deep structure is that it was not created by transformations, but rather the transformations applied to a deep structure yielding a surface structure. The lexicon provided the lexical items (words) for the construction of deep structure, but it played little to no role in the transformational genesis of surface structure (from deep structure). 

The modern Greek alphabet contains only 24 distinct letters. But in lowercase there are 25 glyps: sigma is written ς at the end of a word and σ otherwise. 

To preface: "similarity" depends on the listener, as well as on the sound itself. Categorical perception is a powerful force. To a native English speaker aspiration is almost imperceptible, while /s/ and /θ/ are clearly distinct; to a native Hindi speaker, the opposite would be true. The best way I know of to objectively define phonetic difference is in terms of distinctive features. Every sound can be written as a combination of these features: for instance, /t/ is a "voiceless alveolar plosive", meaning that it lacks the "voice" feature but has "alveolar" and "plosive". Some features are boolean, such as "rounded" for a vowel. It's there or it isn't. Others have multiple comparable values, such as "place of articulation", where bilabial is closer to labiodental than it is to velar. Still others are generally incomparable, such as "manner of articulation" (is a click more like a fricative or an approximant?). Unfortunately I don't know of any definitive, established network of phonemes based on these principles. But a distance metric could be established based on your needs. For example, here's my attempt at a simple distance algorithm, written in Python (representing phonemes as dictionaries). 

Early Romance did not like having two different vowels next to each other with nothing in between (in linguistic terms, "in hiatus"). So a glide consonant was inserted between them. If the first vowel was /o/ or /u/, this glide tended to be a /w/ sound. (This article has more information and examples in different Romance languages.) Then the /w/ phoneme evolved into /v/, probably through /β/. This is a well-documented process which produced most of the /v/'s in Italian, such as the initial sound in vino; in Classical Latin, that initial consonant was a /w/. 

The question is struggling with what school grammar (the type of grammar that many of us were taught in middle school) considers to be a clause as opposed to what theories of syntax consider to be a clause. According to school grammar, a complex sentence consists of two or more clauses, where a clause is generally understood to contain at least a subject and a predicate, e.g. 

The expressions clean, silly, and into a meditative state are resultative adjuncts because they give the result of the scrubbing, worrying, and soothing. In these cases, they are predications over the object, not over the subject. The syntactic analysis of such adjuncts is that they are direct dependents of the verb. The adjectives drunk and angry in the examples in the question are more accurately characterized as depictive adjuncts. They depict the state of a participant during the process expressed by the verb. Depictive adjuncts are typically predications over the subject. An appropriate umbrella term that subsumes both resultative adjuncts as well as depictive adjuncts is participant-oriented adjuncts: clean, silly, into a mediative state, drunk, and angry are all participant-oriented adjuncts because they assign a property to one of the participants in the sentence. Note that one can distinguish between participant-oriented adjuncts and participant-oriented complements. The following sentences illustrate participant-oriented complements: 

These sentences are all fine, indicating that when clean, silly, into a mediative state, drunk, angry do appear in them, they are adjuncts (not complements). 

Consider modern Russian, which has six cases: nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, instrumental, and prepositional. In the first declension these are indicated for the most part by single vowels. 

This phenomenon is called rendaku, or "sequential voicing". Many phonemes in Japanese occur in voiced/unvoiced pairs. In kana writing, these are distinguished with a dakuten "voice mark" over the voiced version: for instance, か /ka/, が /ga/. (Side note: in a few cases this reflects historical rather than current pronunciation: /h/ voices to /b/ because it was originally /ɸ/, and /β/ isn't distinguished from /b/.) Rendaku means that the first sound in the second part of a compound becomes voiced...most of the time. In reality, it's not quite this simple. There are a few additional rules: 

The German case you cite is separate from the English one. In Germanic languages in general, there never was any third-person imperative. But when German borrowed the T-V distinction from neighboring languages, the second person plural (Ihr) took on a polite singular meaning. And later, when this stopped being polite enough, the third person plural (Sie) took over that role. But German had no third person imperative, so the subjunctive was used instead. Bitte rufen Sie ihn is syntactically a subjunctive, and thus the Sie isn't optional (since German isn't pro-drop), unlike in geh [Du] weg. In English, however, and in informal German (using the original second-person pronouns Du and Ihr instead of Sie), the subject pronoun is usually implicit. This is by far the most common case cross-linguistically, at least in my experience. By "implicit" I mean that the pronoun still there, but it doesn't appear on the surface. In a language like Ancient Greek, which marks person on the verb even in the imperative, this implicit pronoun still triggers second-person marking. And in English (and several other languages), the implicit pronoun still triggers reflexives: "go let yourself out", not *"go let you out". This would only be expected if there were an invisible subject pronoun there, C-commanding the reflexive. (There are, in fact, certain constructions that look like imperatives but don't have this implicit subject! My introductory linguistics professor would use "bless you" as his only example of this, but "damn you" and many other expletives fit also. See McCawley's paper under the pseudonym "Quang Phúc Đông" for the details.) The subject-verb inversion here is particular to Germanic, and doesn't quite match any other construction in the language. For example, English negative imperatives use "do"-support even when the verb is "be": "Don't [you] be late!" This doesn't happen in normal indicative sentences: *"He doesn't be late". So the best I can say for this is, it's a special construction used only for imperatives. 

By acknowledging that one has a particular construction, one is in a sense admitting that there is no real grammatical "explanation" for the phenomenon. It simply exists. Finally, note that there are certain apparent exceptions to the principles mentioned above. There are uses of personal pronouns that actually allow modification, e.g. 

Sentence (a) is the starting sentence. Sentence (b) shows proform substitution; the personal pronouns he and her have been substituted in for the noun phrases the man with the hat and the woman with the scarf. Based on the acceptability of sentence (b), one concludes that both the man with the hat and the woman with the scarf are constituents. Definite pronouns such as he and her (and them) take the place of constituents, in this case of complete noun phrases. The unacceptability of sentence (c) reveals that the strings the man and the woman in (a) are not constituents. In other words, the definite personal pronouns he and her cannot take dependents (=modifiers), since they necessarily replace an entire noun phrase. This fact explains why them who lost their money in the question is bad English. The relative clause who lost money is a postdependent (=postmodifier), and as such it cannot modify them (because them as a definite personal pronoun cannot be modified). The plural demonstrative pronouns (these and those) behave differently. They can take postdepndents (=postmodifiers, i.e. a modifier that follows them), e.g 

This is called an "expressive loan": when a loanword is reanalyzed to fit into the patterns of the new language. If an unfamiliar, archaic, or foreign word shifts into something meaningful in the new language, such as expatriate → ex-patriot or Alzheimer's Disease → old-timer's disease, then that's called an "eggcorn". And if the loanword keeps its original form but is given an incorrect etymology in the new language, that's a "folk etymology". There's significant overlap between these three. 

Capitalization is also a part of orthography. German orthography for instance specifies that nouns must be capitalized, and also that the phoneme /x/ is written «ch», and that «ß» is a part of the alphabet, and so on. The distinction between different types of dashes can sometimes be important, but people who are not typesetters usually don't care. As a counterexample, written language can certainly affect spoken language, through phenomena like hypercorrection (when something changes because people think it's wrong, even if it isn't). The «th» in "clothes", the «l» in "falcon", the «h» in "forehead", the «k» in "ski", and many others used to be silent in English. But due to the spelling, people now usually pronounce them. Using their metaphor, you wouldn't expect a misleading map to actually cause changes in the territory, with lakes appearing suddenly due to a blue spot on the map. I can read Ancient Greek, but my pronunciation is atrocious and I doubt I could find a toilet in ancient Athens. To a lesser extent, I can read the difference between aspirated and unaspirated consonants in Hindi far more easily than I can hear it. Usually written English isn't considered a separate language from spoken English, for instance. Whether or not the orthography is truly part of English can, again, be debated, but even if it's separate, it's not a language in and of itself. Most people wouldn't notice the difference, especially in the age of ASCII text. English orthography is indeed an enormous mess. Usually there are historical reasons for the weirdnesses, such as the Great Vowel Shift, but this is little help to a child trying to memorize irregular spellings. Handwritten text tends to be a bit sloppier than typewritten text in certain ways. The precise width of different dashes is one of them. I very much doubt they could be distinguished in my handwriting, or that of most people I know. 

Proform substitution is a test for constituent structure that is widely employed in beginning textbooks for syntax. If a definite proform can be substituted in for a string of words, then that string is likely a constituent. In this case then, his can be substituted in for Ali's, indicating that Ali's is a constituent. Similarly, his can be substituted in for Ali's father's, indicating that Ali's father's is also a constituent. Consider these facts with respect to the first DP tree in the question. That tree shows Ali's as a non-constituent, hence my conclusion is that the first tree in the question is also incorrect. The traditional NP-analysis, which would show Ali's as a constituent, is more defensible. Concerning the second tree in the question, I think the constituent structure shown would be accurate for the NP Ali's father's mother, because the combination Ali's father's would receive the status of a constituent. But the labeling in that tree is all off. 

Both of these sentences are perfectly acceptable. Whether or not one elides call is up to the speaker. Given this observation about ellipsis in general, examples of the partitive genitive should allow the elided noun to occur if they are indeed instances of ellipsis. I think the noun cannot appear, however: 

In these cases, the preposition of appears optionally. With what, the preposition of cannot appear, e.g. *what of a beautiful child. Furthermore, the indefinite article is obligatory in such cases. With what, the indefinite article need not appear, e.g.
