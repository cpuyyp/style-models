There is some quibbling about what reproducing an effect actually means, but, as @MoziburUllah points out, modern science is reproducible because it adopts the assumption that to be useful, things have to be reproducible, and limits itself to those things. (So asking 'Why?' here is like asking why the wall you painted blue, is blue.) Religion and magic are actually equally common. But people prefer to call their magic religion, when they can get away with it. The idea that supernatural forces affect real life is a valid religious principle in almost every religion, even those without gods. Various religions allow for 'higher' and 'lower' levels of supernatural status. For instance, traditional Roman Catholicism allows for a belief in the power of individual prayer, directly to God via Christ, and also for 'intercessory' prayer, where one appeals to the specific concerns a given Saint expressed in life or in previous intercessions, and you speak to them by name, to more easily make one's case, but ask for smaller favors. When analyzed and organized, this latter practice can be come a form of magic known variously as Santeria, Condomble, Voudou, etc. But it is not different in real basis from the orthodox religious practices. One is speaking to identified dead people who have responded in the past to messages with certain contents, often delivered in a specific ritual form ('Hail Mary, full of Grace...') and you expect them to respond, so that your emotional energy has some effect on the world. So some religions are structured in a way that makes an arbitrary distinction between magic and more genuine religious expectations easier to make. It is easy for me to look at my grandparent's prayers to Mary in three different forms, St. Thomas and St. Jude as more 'magical' than my sibling's prayers "In Jesus Name". Other religions, like those that choose to call themselves 'Witchcraft' and 'Satanism' on purpose, abolish the distinction and choose to call it all Magic, to make the point of identifying with the less refined, less pretentious practitioners of other religions. However it is made, the distinction within a religion is only relative. It is all religion, and, when effects are sought, it is also all magic. In the best cases: cultures like Louisiana slave populations constituted from randomly selected African nations, with multiple religions that respect one another; or periods of Islamic history when folks were OK with competing-but-not-hostile leadership of the same religion; or periods of Christian history when Alchemy and Astrology were seen as "echos of God's Will" -- people have used the word 'Magic' to refer to the other peoples' miracles. When they are 'loas', Vodou is magic, when they are 'Saints', it is religion. When a Sunni cleric writes a verse on a special slate and cleans it with appropriate reverence in order to shorten the term of a disease it is magic to more 'modernized' Muslims, but proper religious devotion to some ultra-Orthodox Muslims. When a Christian Astrologer casts your chart and believes in the influence of Mars on you that week, it is magic. But it is the remnant of a genuine religion, in which that person, to some degree, still believes (even if they need a big dose of Jungian psychology to wash it down with). Monotheistic 'Manicheanism' from time to time invades those cultures and turns all such relativistic Magic into Satanism and Witchcraft, or into 'superstition' (while protecting itself, somehow, from being similarly identified, though it is belief in something standing above reality, which is the etymology of the word). But that is a very local interpretation, and it does not even apply to large swaths of the major monotheistic religions outside strict orthodoxies. 'Magic' seems like a separate category to cultures like Europe where rigid monotheism repeatedly overlayed and alienated other religions and pushed them into a secondary status, without eradicating their practices. But if we look at places not overridden by Manicheanized forms of monotheism, it looks less that way. Is praying to Ganesh religion or magic? How about Shinto observances? Or the calendar rituals preserved by Confucianism? The distinction of magic from science, before the modern period, is equally weak. Was Arabic Alchemy magic, religion, applied philosophy, or underdeveloped science? Which is Kabbalah? The distinctions become silly, even in the West. 

Much of philosophy is true but vacuous: dualism vs monism, various theories of mind, etc. They are interesting, but ultimately don't have real bearing on life. Proving something does not prove a workable way of addressing the world does not make it untrue or sophistical. Nor does it mean that older solutions might not in some way be better than ones that are more correct. It would be difficult if not impossible to live your life thinking of everything in a way that takes relativity and quantum dynamics seriously at every moment. But they are real. In my interpretation, the problem we seem to be having with postmodernism is in wishing it had more significance and guiding value than it really can provide. We marry it to other objections to modernism and logical positivism and claim it vindicates or supports them them. But it did not provide those, other forms of sophistry did. We mix up together the effects of having too much information in our culture for people to digest, the war between science and religion that we created and all of the sophistical dancing it has spun into our worldview, our own conflicting history of Christian morality promulgated through extremely anti-Christian execution, and postmodernist awareness of social reality. And we pretend this holds together as a piece and that it proceeds primarily from its latest contributor. At the same time in terms of really providing a better solution for the problems it addresses, one needs to do so by taking it seriously, if only as an adversary. I cannot speak directly to Sokal & Bridgemont, but most of those who object to it fail to do so. If you want to criticize postmodernism from any point other than from inside itself, you are not going to manage this by looking at its effects, only its causes. You need to provide the kind of solution for realistically describing our own process of definition and reasoning that Wittgenstein and Quine finally gave up on. We have no problem identifying and addressing sophistry, throughout the history of philosophy. This is why we name that subject after the given group of people against whom our leading lights of ancient philosophy stood in the west, the professional sophists. Had they not won, we would not idolize them. 

If the argument is truly formal, you can take that inventory. I can know, when doing algebra (or deductions in the kinds of logic that are 'algebras') whether or not I have obeyed the rules. I can check at each step, because the allowed variations of operations are stated. But truly formal arguments work on models that need to be interpreted. It is only if there are any elements of interpretation, that your argument holds water. In that case, this is not wordplay, but is about the general weakness of linguistic conventions. Wittgenstein would agree that proof is relative to a language game, and there is no global language game with a single standard of proof that will apply in all the others. (To my mind, that is what you have proven (if not very clearly...).) But within the context of any game in question, even without formalism, proof is still well-defined. The current rules in a court of law, for instance, are understood. They are open to change, but reaching a closing move within the current rules still produces effective action. Relativism only matters until it doesn't anymore. The question is not whether there is proof, but what kind of proof is expected by whom. I can prove one earthworm plus one earthworm is two earthworms, but then what if one bites the other in half? Each half worm is a whole worm, the way worms work. Does math or biology win? Do we throw out the mathematical principle as not proving anything because it has exceptions in other domains? No. It is not just a word game, it is a divergence of perspectives. (To put it in your terms, the math is overly precise and thus often wrong.) Skepticism is a particularly useful perspective sometimes, and a pointless one at other times. But the fact that nothing can be proved to an absolute skeptic generally does not matter to anyone else, because humans tend work only inside some minimal set of games. 

From a naturalistic version of Kant, I would propose the first question we should ask, is, What if this were perfectly ordinary? Would anyone be deprived of consent or value? Would people be able to retain their conscience? And if the normal became compulsory, how much would those answers change? (These are softened and naturalized versions of Kant's four forms of the Categorical Imperative) Given that this is a very resource-intensive substance, at a certain level of consumption it can only be provided in a way that is extortionary. How low is that level, and what are one's odds of a user remaining below that level? We could explore that, and for a given individual it may be sustainable. But the third point is the most relevant -- in general people are generally not free to chose their ultimate level of use, it is set by personality factors and biology. Experience suggests that biology chooses an unmaintainable level for most of us. So the substance itself sets up a contradiction that pulls users into an immoral state of inadvertent classism. Users come to need this, and the average user cannot allow the price to reach its fair level, or they will physically suffer. Yet they will be drawn to seek it out, and pay what they can. So the market will not abate. If this were more ordinary, therefore, the odds are quite high someone would get badly oppressed, whether or not the exact system that serves this problem now would arise in all of its intricate complexity. Conscience probably could not be maintained. And if experimentation with the substance became so common people really felt they were not participating in the society without taking part, many people would be put through painful withdrawals pointlessly. So just going out and buying cocaine is a bad idea for a good reason. 

I am not going to attempt a survey, just an example raised in my mind by a different question. I think that various modern moves, e.g. Searle's dismissal of the notion of mediating subjective experience in favor of naive direct experience, are motivated indirectly by folks like Maturana. Given its timing, even without tracing the roots, the overall revival of an active role for the mind, dismissing partitioning of the mind and body, layers of representation, etc. proceeds from modern theories of internal modelling and feature detection, as opposed to traditionalist representationality. I personally don't think the folks moving that direction have taken in the science correctly, and I think Maturana himself proves Searle's position inadequate. But, as I see it, the science is creating a new thread within discussions of mind that finds models more compatible with post-Modernism without loss of meaning. 

I would argue that emotion covers the entire range of human thought, and that separating out a given set of subjective experiences as emotion is ultimately misleading. This may simply be an oversimplification of the data @labreuer lays out in his answer. But I think that data suggests that emotion is not just a component of reason, but the central process of reasoning. What makes a logical conclusion acceptable to your mind? One would like to imagine there is some internal computing system that objectively labels logic good or bad. But in the end, what convinces us of a logical truth is the feeling of clarity. This is an emotion. (I would claim it is a mild form of the very emotion of joy in power that Nietzsche promotes, the natural reaction to knowing one's will is in accord with reality.) The same is true for memory. Not only is recall largely governed by emotional state, but I would argue that the certainty or doubt we have toward a memory is entirely a feeling, and emotion. Without that feeling of doubt or certainty, the memory fades. So knowledge is, in a very real way, also an emotion. You feel that you know things, and if you do not feel any certainty or doubt about them, they are not part of your fund of information. Things towards which you feel no real belief or disbelief, you are certain of remembering having learned, so you only kind of meta-know them to begin with, but your indirect relationship to the knowledge is still through an emotion. If logic and memory are based on emotions, what is left of thought that is not governed by emotion? To my mind, nothing. So to whatever degree the whole of thought is reliable, emotion, being the whole of thought, is reliable. Not just pseudoscience, but real science is when the feeling of clarity compels us to trust some perceptions and not others. And no, we cannot ever know science or other belief is not deceiving us. We can just chip away at the probability we are wrong by testing our feelings against outcomes.
