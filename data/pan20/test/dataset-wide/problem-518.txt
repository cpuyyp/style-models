This question is confusing with some misstatements but I am going to try your "asymmetry of forces". If this is not what you mean on "asymmetry of forces" then I suggest you clarify as many people have tired to answer the question in a number of ways. Work is done on the rubber to deform it. Work is the integral force in the direction of the work. Work and heat have the same unit of measure. Yes conservation of energy applies. On the front edge work (integral of f x ds) is performed on the tire to displace it. The tire is not like a spring where the work is given back on tailing edge. Virtually all the work is translated to heat (friction in the rubber). Heat is more intense than you would think - it takes a lot of work to produce a heat. You get a very small spring back from the rubber back on the tail end. The heat does not just accumulate as temperature - the heat is then transferred to the atmosphere. The deformation on the front end also does work on the air in the tire. On the tail end the air in the tire does work tire to push it back out. Most of this work is given back. Some of this work on the air in the tire is translated to random kinetic energy (temperature) and that equates to work not given back on the tailing edge. The other problem there is on the tail end due to the delay most of this work pushing back is not even against the road to propel the tire. It is is work done on the rubber and atmosphere. A tire with more displacement has more resistance. That resistance is more more heat. There is conservation of energy. 

Since drag is related to velocity squared at low speeds anti-aero won't do much. Bulky regular clothes but that won't change your aerodynamics much. Why not just divert and take a longer route to commute? 

I disagree with your assertion that a metal bike is better because gives you warning It is not common that you see a slight bend prior to total failure. And a sight bend will typically result in injury also If the fork bends and traps the wheel on the frame you are going down Brittle failure is when it snaps and plastic deformation is when it bends. Metals can also suffer from brittle failure - especially aluminum A high carbon steel (designed for hardness over strength) can have brittle failure With loading metals fatigue and often with no visual indicator Titanium is the least brittle followed by steel then aluminum Titanium is also expensive Correct a 3 lb carbon frame is not as strong as 6 lb steel frame But 6 lb steel is not twice a strong 

Depends on the trails and the type of riding and how big of tires you can put on the road bike. Based on frame and brakes you are probably limited to 28mm or 30mm. Still a lot better than 25mm. If you are dealing with sand and/or big sharp rocks then 30mm is not enough. As for mud just don't ride mud. Mud need excess clearance. So you might as well just go with touring type tire and give yourself a bigger footprint to deal with traffic issues. It is not going to be CX bike - the best you can do is beef it up. What I am saying is you probably can't beef it up so much that stops being a valid road bike. Ride it and get a feel for if you want to get a second bike. You may decide you want to leave your road road and get a second mountain bike. I would not go with a separate set of wheels. Your brakes will probably not take a wider CX rim so you are just going to get a beefier road wheel. A beefy set of wheels is going to be $400 and you should not be riding a road frame that hard. Look for a used CX. Season just ended and you can find some good deals. And CX varies a bit - a pure race may only take 35mm tires. Get one that will take 38mm or larger. And don't rule out a mtn bike - you can find some decent used mtn bikes for $400. You can throw $400 into your road bike and it is still not going to be a good trail bike. 

There are so many styles of bikes now that it is hard to decide. Bike shops will help you select the proper bike and fit you to the bike. As a newbie I would not decide over the web and order online. In a comment you asked about efficiency (and distance). Distance does not affect efficiency. Over a small distance efficiency is just not as big a factor. I am used to miles so will report in miles. That is about 12 miles. So at 12 mph it is 60 minutes and at 14 mph it is about 50 minutes. You should get a 2 mph bump on a cyclocross (for me it is 3-4 mph). So a difference of like 10 minutes. But you may want the exercise. Not all of that is the style of bike as the cyclocross is also going to have more narrow tires. On a longer distance the drop bars are are nice. You can vary hand position to spread fatigue and more aerodynamic. For your commute can go either way. But if you want to go on some 40 miles road rides then cyclocross (and some more road type tires). I have done 100 miles on my cyclocross (with road tires). 

There are good bike bags for lap tops. Need water proof, padding, and solid mounting. Mount and unmount rapidly. Also consider how it carries off the bike. Does it look like a brief case so you can use it like a brief case during the day. To deal with length on the front wheel can help - that is how I carry. I don't like putting out a names but like the Otlierb Office. As far as damaging it takes a bit of shock to break a lap top. The vibration on a bike is not likely to harm a lap top hard drive. I have dropped lap top hard drives on the floor and not broken them. One thing is power it all the way down (not snooze) so the drive is parked. A pack tends to be soft so it will conform to your back. I have lost a couple screens due to the flex. I think a semi rigid bike bag is better than a pack. The quality of the laptop is a big factor Look for a laptop with a metal case Soft plastic will bend and hard plastic will crack Cheap hinges will wear out I used to do lap top repair 

Since no answers I will post my comment as an answer Car wheel cleaner. It is made to deal with brake dust. But I would not user car wheel cleaner on paint. For hard to clean on paint I use a cleaner wax. 

Depends on how viscous and deep the mud is. If the mud is viscous like clay and maybe leaves mixed and a fat tire can float and still get traction then the bigger tire is better. But with normal mud and less than 6 inches deep then a thinner tire that will sink to the bottom for traction and might do better. I was in a cyclocross race recently where we had a few inches of rain over the prior 2 days. There were both mountain bikes with 2+" tires and cyclocross with 33-35mm. The cyclocross were more effective. Even muddy grass the smaller tires did better. The bigger tires got pushed around and still did not get good surface traction. The other factor is the amount of mud you are going to carry. A fat tire is going to hold a lot more mud and get heavy. 

Not going to delete to lose the down votes. The stated question is advantage is nitrogen. Not should I use nitrogen. I cover the technical side of the characteristics of nitrogen versus air and the chemical and physical reason for the differences. 

With panniers. I know you are looking for a faster bike but I have carried a case of wine on that bike many times and up front and it rides fine. A benefit of up front is you don't have the weight swinging behind you when you accelerate. Down side is with bags attached it is hard to ride no hands. 

First save the valve out of any tubes you discard (if the valve is good). And you can buy valve core separate. The valve was two sets of thread. One to open and close the valve and the other to remove the valve core. Removing the pump can loosen the valve core. You can use a tool such as core removal tool or a small pair of pliers to tighten the core. If it gets loose I use just a dab of locktite on the threads but you must be very careful to not get any on the gasket or the valve will stick. I have a bad set of tubes and did this to all of them up front. Just a dab on the threads in the middle. And open the valve before you tighten it. 

And I don't understand the number and magnitude of the negative numbers. Even when it looks like you were in a cadence your negative were 1/3 the positive. And in a stretch you have negative that are some on the biggest numbers. 

As others has said P = F X V Lets say it felt 10 KG - under the force of gravity that is 98 newtons - lets just round up to to 100 N Let say you were doing 15 kmh 100 N 15 km/h * 1 h/3600 sec * 1000/1k = 100 * 15 / 3.6 = 41.67 watts If if felt like about 10 KG and you were doing 15 kmh then about 40 watts Something like Gruber power assist is 200 watts 

If you know exactly where the edge is then you stay on that edge and that is maximum braking. The problem is you don't always know exactly where the edge is. Modulate near the edge is way to manage that unknown. You are accepting that you will spend some time in the kinetic range. Let's say you know within a 5% error where the edge is then you would be better off just braking at 95% if the ratio of static / kinetic > 1 / .95. Sorry to get mathematical on you but your mental estimate of max static is more like a bell curve. So if you come off max by 5% and still modulate you may only be in the kinetic range 5% of the time. If you feel yourself in the kinetic range more then you back off. Modulation is both a method to manage and measure the unknown max static. In real life you push it and then back off. This is OK in a straight where you can skid and typically not fall. Into a corner it is more problematic as a skid can turn into a fall. Max braking is not typically the fastest way around a track. 

Mud is even difficult for experienced riders. And a fat tires is not always better at mud. If you need to dig down to get to solid ground a more narrow tire can be better. Sand is where a fat tire is nice. But even soft deep sand is going to be a challenge on a fat tire. I would look for a 29" mountain bike that will take up to 2.4" tires. And there are are mud tires. Mud tires does not just get better traction but they shed the mud better. 

I suggest your analysis is flawed Finger strength to cable pull has a lot of variability: - internal leverage in the brake lever mechanism - where on the lever the force is applied - on the brake mechanism itself you have different leverages Most mountain brakes are used with two fingers and many levers are not even long enough for 4 fingers On a drop bar are you on the hoods or in the drops If you want some good numbers then you need to put a weight on the brake cable And most brakes can skid a tire. Once you skid the tire (rear) or go out font (front) the max does not come into play. What are you trying to accomplish here?
