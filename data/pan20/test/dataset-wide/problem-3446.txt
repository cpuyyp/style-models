What would be economically most efficient is that for the price of oil to reflect all its costs, including all the pollution costs. A price that high would destroy a lot of demand, and incentivise all the cleaner alternatives with less need to subsidise them. Professor Jeff Sachs has spoken emphatically of the advantage of a low oil price, for the COP21 negotiations. Firstly, it makes a lot of the existing resource uneconomic. And secondly, it cuts oil companies profits; they are a very powerful, very vocal lobby, and deep cuts to their revenue weakens them. So, low prices received by producers is good, because it will minimise new resource extraction (and exploration); and high prices paid by consumers is good (because it reduces oil consumption). And the gap between the two is optimally filled by a carbon tax across all greenhouse-gas emitters. 

Feminist Economics is a broad field covering, broadly, how gender relates to the trade-offs involved in circumstances of scarcity. Economics as a field was dominated by men for a long time. As a result, the questions that were asked were artificially limited, as were the answers that came. Feminist Economics sets about correcting these historical gaps, and the power imbalances that result from them. As it progresses, the work it establishes just becomes known as economics: it gets incorporated into the mainstream of economics. For example, see the work being done one measuring progress as something much more comprehensive than merely the sum of all monetary incomes. 

It was successful because it combined three things at the same time. Firstly, it increased available currency at a time when currency was scarce for any but the rich - so everyone was more solvent. Secondly, it had a negative interest rate, so the encouragement was to spend quickly. And thirdly, it was a local initiative, and belonged to the town, at a time that was particularly introspective - isolationist, even. 

There were two substantial reasons why Britain led, and the world followed, in recapitalising the banking system. The first is that a very large proportion of citizens' money on deposit at banks is protected by the State anyway, so the State was already liable for that cost. The second is that the banks are responsible for carrying a very large proportion of transactions. And if a bank can't deal with other banks, either because it's insolvent or because it presents significant counter-party risk, it ceases to be part of the global network of transactions. If that network jams up, then a huge chunk of global economic activity ceases, both within the affected countries, and between them and the rest of the world. The consequential global depression would have been much deeper, and potentially even longer, than what came about. There are a bunch of other things that happened, that needn't; and they made things worse (e.g. the open-ended bailout of bank bond-holders). And there were things that could have been done, that would have made things better, quicker, that weren't (e.g. the cancelling of the personal debts that triggered the massive liquidity crunch in the collateralised-debt markets). But in terms of the lessening of a global economic disaster, bank recapitalisation was very effective. 

There is no clear separation between what is and what is not a start-up. It's a non-technical term, and so has all the usual blurriness and context-sensitivity that goes along with that. A start-up is usually taken to have come from nothing, with a new product or service (or new variation of existing ones). Its founders typically put in all the equity themselves, perhaps leveraged with some debt (maxing out personal credit cards, for example); and then manage it, and typically provide (almost) all the labour inputs themselves. And as a founder, it consumes all your time and energy. Whereas some young companies are spun out of existing enterprises. Some young companies start with an existing product, and/or have separation of ownership, management and workforce. They would typically not be referred to as start-ups. 

It's lots of things, which added together means it's not going to happen. Firstly, the initial calculation of area required was just to illustrate how small the world's energy use is, compared to the amount of energy we receive in sunlight, even after compensating for the 20% efficiency of PV modules. So it wasn't actually intended as an engineering solution. Secondly, there is little political interest globally in becoming completely dependent on a handful of North African countries for electricity supply: most countries made that mistake with oil and OPEC, creating decades of geopolitical mess. Thirdly, it's not a great renewables scenario, because the amounts of energy generated in any two spots of that 1.2% of the Sahara are very closely correlated over all timescales from hours to decades, which means the whole output of the theoretical farm would not show a lot of smoothness. It doesn't span that many timezones, so there'd be several hours every day with no output, for the entire world. Now, that can be addressed with back-up power - just use excess PV to generate hydrogen which is stored, then burnt when its dark to generate electricity then - but that's when it starts getting expensive. It's cheaper to diversify both the types of energy harvested (wind, tidal, geothermal, hydro, biomass), and the geographic area over which it's harvested (both latitude and longtitude), which significantly reduces the storage requirements needed, and reduces the risks associated with intra-annual and inter-annual variability of supply. This also hugely reduces the geo-political implications, and means that all countries get a decent chunk of internal investment from the project. 

Yes, there are lots. Several state-owned energy companies succeed in international competitive markets, for example. EDF is majority-owned by the French State, and is a successful competitor in energy markets in other countries; e.g. GB electricity retail. DONG is majority-owned by the Danish State, and is a successful competitor in energy markets in other countries; e.g. UK offshore windfarm installation. 

Because you can't push on a piece of string. As in the Great Depression of the 1930s, we've collectively got massive personal debt, depressing demand, moving us towards deflation, which pushes up debt, and so it goes. We've also known since the 1930s that monetary expansion in and of itself cannot stimulate demand under these conditions: it can only create space for demand to expand into. Add in the international fashion for fiscal contraction, a demand-suppressant, and that's how we get QE without broad-money expansion and without inflation. We do have potential inflation. And at some point that potential will be realised. But not while there's this huge overhang of personal debt. It might get worn down over a long period of deflation, through defaults. Some other inflationary shock might inflate some of the debt away. And enlightened policy-makers might engage in a large exercise in personal-debt cancellation. 

If either of those do not hold, then Malthusian theory does not hold. And it turns out that neither of them hold: 

Anyone can buy corporations as long as their money is good. That's as true for governments as it is for individuals. So as long as their money is good, they can pretty much buy what they like. A country that carried on printing money would soon find it had inflation & currency depreciation. That is to say, it's money isn't as good as it used to be. So now, it needs more money to buy assets. That's the limiting factor, right there. 

Denesp's comment is your full answer: it's a badly-drawn chart which fails to do its one job, that was to illustrate that the long-run cost curve consists of joining up the minima of the short-run cost curves. 

So for those two reasons, when we move from dirty energy to clean energy, the global economy will become much less coupled to changes in short-run marginal costs of energy. 

The oil price has fallen because production is very high, demand has not risen in line with production, and so the world's existing oil stores have filled. Neither hydro, nor wind nor PV are substitutes for oil, so they can't directly drive down oil prices. To explain: hydro, wind and PV generate electricity; but very little oil is used to generate electricity. Machines that do consume oil products - and these machines are predominantly vehicles - cannot just choose to use electricity instead of oil products. They require different engines. In the long term (let's say the next 30 years), as vehicles get electrified and / or switch to cleaner fuels, renewables will make oil consumption obsolete. The first million electric vehicles took 30 years to sell. The next million vehicles will sell in 18 months. (source: Bloomberg New Energy Finance). But those long-term effects aren't priced into today's price of oil, because the oil that is stored, and being extracted today, will all have been burnt by then. If you want to see signs of the long-term effects, then you might find them in the share prices of oil, gas and coal producers, which are supposed to embody long-term information. 

Having read the machine translations of the news articles, it seems to me that there is a misunderstanding about what is being proposed. The proposal is not to destroy value. The proposal is to introduce notes for a new currency, very quickly, in a way that does not involve destroying value. The cash economy needs tokens of exchange: notes and coins. A new currency normally has months or even years of preparation, to do the design, testing and massive-scale printing. A New Drachma simply wouldn't have that time to come into existence. So, the problem to solve is: how to get a sufficient number of currency notes into circulation to keep the Greek cash economy moving? Greece already has lots of Euro notes, but a New Drachma would be a different currency with a floating (and in this case rapidly dropping) exchange rate. So the proposal is to use existing notes, but to transform them with an irreversible process into New Drachma. This would be undertaken by the State. Every time a Euro note comes into a bank, the bank would get a digital Euro credit in exchange for the physical note. The note then gets transformed into a New Drachma note, and returned to circulation. The ECB gives a digital Euro credit to the Greek government for the total value of the notes so transformed. Remember, physical currency has no intrinsic value: that's part of the reason it's so useful and so effective. Let's break the process up into stages: 

The word rent has two different meanings. One is the lay meaning: the price paid for the use of property for a fixed period of time. The specific technical meaning within the context of rent-seeking is as set out in the link in your question. This is a different meaning to the lay meaning. It is not the same meaning. It is different. The same word can be used to mean two different things. Even though it's the same word. One word, two different meanings. We use the context to determine which is the appropriate meaning. As the context in your question is economics (something of which you are well aware, as you have posted this question on the Economics SE), then the technical meaning, as defined in the link you provided, is the relevant one. Not the lay meaning. So rent-seeking, is about seeking economic rent (technical sense); it is not about charging the rent (lay sense) for the use of the property. Lobbying and rent-seeking are different things. Lobbying may or may not involve rent-seeking. Rent-seeking may or may not involve lobbying. It's like asking whether fish is the same thing as chips. You can have fish with or without chips. You can have chips with or without fish. Just because they often go together, does not mean they are the same thing.
