Expanding on @VCG's comment, which pretty much answered the question: You can model this by adding a simultanous first move (to sign or not to sign) for both players. If they both choose to sign the contract, a predesignated outcome $A$ is realized and they get the corresponding payoffs. If they do not both sign, the original game is played. Whether they will sign the contract or not will depend on their beliefs about what payoff they could expect in equilibrium. If a player's expected payoff from the original game is larger than what they would get in $A$ they will not sign. (There are similar considerations in Aumann's correlated equilibrium, though there is no enforcable contract there.) An example for when you would not sign the enforcable contract: Consider a game of chicken with the payoffs . (Source: Wikipedia) Suppose players could sign a contract forcing them to chose the "Chicken" strategy. A player will not do so if for some reason she expects that the other player will play chicken anyway, allowing her to collect a payoff of 7. In fact, using forward induction not signing may serve as a signal: The only reason he would not sign the contract is because she expects to win a larger than 6 payoff. The only way she can do this is by playing "Dare". Thus if the other player was willing to sign the contract, she she effectively signalled that she intends to play "Dare" by not signing the contract. Unfortunately according to the logic of forward induction the other player will also not sign. 

Has evolutionary game theory ever been used to successfully describe an ecosystem or a reasonably closed subsystem of the economy? A frequently used example is about side-blotched lizards but I don't know of any others. And has it ever been proven that in this case the main factor is really relative fitness of strategies and not some other factor, such as the dynamics of gene recombination? 

One of the key (and often criticized) assumptions of Game Theory is the rationality of the players/agents and common knowledge thereof. That is the agents will make the best decision for themselves given the information available. This assumption basically says cognitive costs are negligable. E.g. I can easily tell wether it is optimal for me to buy luggage insurance. In reality I would probably need to look up statistics and make some basic calculations. Agent-based modelling frequently uses heuristic behavioral rules instead of optimization. In some circumstances this rules are not optimal, but very close. A nice example is the gaze heuristic: 

By social welfare your professor probably means total economic surplus which is the sum of consumer's surplus and producer's surplus. 

Suppose there is a linear demand function $D(p)$ describing the demand of an individual consumer. This is derived from a utility function or is just observed, but let us assume it is correct. Now suppose that the product is available at price $p$, but the store insists that each consumer buys a minimum amount that is in fact larger than $D(p)$, but only by very little. Say it is $D(p) + \epsilon$, where $\epsilon < D(p)/100$. Can I say without additional assumptions that given the options of buying a quantity $q$ where $q \in \left\{0\right\} \bigcup \left[D(p) + \epsilon,\infty\right)$, the consumer will choose to buy $D(p) + \epsilon$? My argument is that this will maximize her consumer surplus given the constraint on $q$. As I specified that this is a linear demand function and $\epsilon < D(p)/100$ you can do the math, but it is easy to see that the surplus will be positive for any continuous demand function given a small enough $\epsilon$. Is this an accepted line of argumentation? In most models it is accepted that consumers seek to maximize their utility. I am not sure however if one can argue absent a utility function that surplus maximization is the goal. A workaround would be specifying a quasi-linear utility function supporting $D(p)$ but I would like to avoid this if possible. 

How come they accepted the 8 euro offer if they could have gone to the people who pay 15 euros as well? Could it be that matching the suppliers and the customers has same value? If what you are doing is truly trivial you will get nothing. If what you are doing is not trivial but relatively easy then you will soon have a competitior who is offering 10 euros to steal your workforce. And competition should eventually price the value of your activities. Of course the real world is more complicated, but in your example the work of the matchmaker has value. In response to the edit: 

Using Google translate I have read some of the articles you referred. It seems to me that the problem the Swedish economists are talking about is that Greece will need its own currency (this is debatable). However it takes a long time to get currency in sufficient amounts. 

Sure, because dollars are nominal goods. Perhaps a ticket to Star Wars Episode CXVIII will cost one trillion dollars. If you meant today, without huge changes in the price level: Yes, there is way more than one trillion dollars of wealth in the world. Depending on the laws of physics and psychology there is probably something you would be able to market for this amount. (Private luxury homes in other dimensions.) Coming up with it is another question, but there is no law of economics that makes this impossible. 

It depends on what you mean by generically. The Prisoner's Dilemma has exactly one equilibrium. If you generate the payoffs in your $2 \times 2$ game by drawing payoffs from continuous i.i.d.'s then there is a non-zero probability (seems to me that the exact number is 25%) that you will get a game similar to the Prisoner's Dilemma, i.e. a game with strictly dominant strategies for both players. There is also a 'smaller' class of games with even number of equilibria, you can read about them here: $URL$ 

Clearly false. One of the largest skyscrappers in Tokyo has an area of 2,630,300 square feets. Estimating value per square feet to be \$5000, its value is less than $15 billion. The houses in Los Angles alone were worth an estimated $2.5 trillion this year. Assuming that both estimates are off by a factor of 10, and the skyscrapper was once worth ten times as much while the LA homes were worth ten times less, the skyscrapper's value would be still less. And the comparison was just with the value of LA homes, not the entire state of California. @BrianRomanchuk's version may be much closer to the truth. To be honest I still find it hard to believe. Perhaps they measured net worth of California. 

Would you like to buy a pack of sugar flavored amazonian soil for 500 dollars? You can probably answer this question even though you have never heard of this product before. Being able to answer this question, being able to place the newly available consumption alternatives within your ranking is the assumption of completeness. The same is true if a type of good is replaced. The set of consumption alternatives is changed, but given any two you can still tell which one you prefer. 

Arc elasticity can be measured empirically, point elasticity can only be approximated. In case of small changes the two should be reasonably close. Point elasticity requires some knowledge of calculus. 

One is an algebraic formula, the other is the geometric representation of that formula. They are the same as much as a straight line and the equation describing said line are the same. 

For any game, trembling hand perfect equilibria are a subset of sequential equilibria. What is a simple example where a sequential equilibrium is not a trembling hand perfect equilibrium? Is it possible to create a normal form example? Links: Kreps-Wilson: Sequential Equilibria Selten: Reexamination of the Perfectness Concept for Equilibrium Points in Extensive Games 

Another reasoning could be that people would be willing to take larger loans from commercial banks to cover their increased spending needs. This increased demand for loans drives up interest rates as well. 

Until the last paragraph your interpretation is correct. $(a,d)$ is not a strategy profile, it is merely a 'history', a way that the game can play out. A strategy of a player is a function that chooses an action in each of her decision nodes. As you can see in your graph Player A has three decision nodes while B has two. Hence any strategy of player A will consist of three elements, while any strategy of B will consist of two elements. So $(agi,de)$ is indeed a strategy profile. The corresponding history, what will happen if the players play these strategies, is $(a,d)$. The corresponding payoff is (1,2). I am unsure what you mean by having to account for all possible strategies. Do you want to see what it means when an equilibrium is not subgame perfect? That would be $(ahj,de)$. No player can gain by unilaterally switching to another strategy, but if we were to reach player A's second or third decision node his action would not be optimal. But $(ahj,de)$ can be an equilibrium because the history given by this strategy profile never reaches these nodes. Do you want to find all the equilibria that are not subgame perfect? In that case you should write down all possible strategies: There are 2^3 strategies for A, 2^2 strategies for B. Make a matrix using these as row and column labels. (Not sure if you really want to do this, as it is rather large.) Then you calculate the history and payoff for each strategy profile, creating a payoff matrix. In this you will find many equilibria. The ones that are not $(agi,de)$ and $(bgi,df)$ are not subgame perfect.
