Compare the relative position of the flat bar and the saddle on your current bike. (ie. is the flat bar higher/lower than the saddle ? How long is the stem? ) When you demo road bikes, check that the top of the drop bar is at least close to the same height wrt to the saddle as your current flat bars. Drop bars aren't that big a change, but you have to be able to get the fit roughly close. 

(axle width) Maybe, there is a pretty good chance your bike is already at 130mm O.L.D. spacing. Road bikes would be at 120 or 126mm from that era, but a mid 80's MTB has a reasonable chance of being at 130mm. 

I'd say that for loaded touring the place to start is tires, not wheel size. You need a bike that can accommodate larger tires. 32mm at a minimum and 40+ if you plan to travel on dirt roads or take on very heavy loads. It's generally easier to find a 26" wheeled bike that can take larger tires, but if you find a 28" bike that can accommodate larger tires that will work fine as well. In theory if you build a 26" wheel and a 28" wheel with the same rim and spoke type/count, the 26" wheel will be stronger. But there are plenty of people touring with 28" wheels. The most important thing is to get a frame that fits you and has a comfortable geometry. If you're less than 170cm or so in height, 26" wheels might make more sense on a bike that small. Look at bikes that are built for touring and see what their specs are in terms of geometry and wheel size. Wheel size is the last thing you should be worrying about. Look at the specs for this bike $URL$ In the smaller sizes it comes with 26" wheels and 28" wheels in the larger sizes. 

Your current bike has decent wheels and reasonable components. If they have been maintained well I don't think you'll see much difference there other than 10spd gearing. The big change to a new bike in that price range will be the frame. It is much easier now to get a frame that actually fits your riding style, I see you have an adjustable angle stem. Since carbon frames allow a lot more design freedom and riders have come around to the idea that the typical rider does not need a "racing" bike unless they are actually racing, it's much easier to get a frame that actually fits you and your riding style. The new bike will be lighter and you'll feel like it's faster, but it won't be that much faster in a typical ride. Humans are very low power engines so even a little loss in bike weight will make the bike accelerate faster, but you'll still get to the same limits in top speed. Climbing will be a bit easier, but not much. Bikes have gotten much more expensive in the last 10 years, 1500 euros is entry level at this point. You can get a nice bike in that price range, but some of the components will not be a nice as the ones you currently have. If you like the gearing and the way the shifters work on your current bike, you might consider upgrading just the frame. You should demo a current bike and decide if you like the shape and fit of the middle range Shimano and SRAM brifters. Having a bike that is comfortable and fits well far outweighs any minor gains in lost weight. 

Wash it with mild soap and water. Use an old toothbrush to clean and low pressure water to rinse. Put in the sun to dry. There are very few things on bikes that will actually rust any more. As long as you avoid high pressure sprays[1] and make sure its' dry before you store it, there's almost nothing on the bike that will be affected by soap and water. [1]- High pressure sprays can get water past bearing seals and that is not good. 

I have used Shimano 10 speed cranks with 9spd chain, derailluers and gears. Without actually having tried it with the Campy components you list, I see no reason why it shouldn't work. The only difference between 9spd and 11 spd chain is the exterior width of the chain. The interior dimensions are identical (i.e. 3/32 of an inch wide, 1/2 inch long). The one issue you may run into is that the front chainrings may be slightly closer together than a 9 speed crank. When you are using gear combos that involve the cross chaining on the small chainring, the extra width of 9 speed chain may catch on the larger chainring. The shifting may not be as precise and fast as an all 11 speed setup, but of all the parts of the drivetrain the front cranks are the least "speed specific" and the easiest to interchange. 

Unless you plan to do a lot of sprinting up muddy hills to jump barriers, the studs are just extra weight that makes annoying noises when you're walking around. SPD is great for touring since you can easily walk around in the shoes, the studs detract from that without adding much benefit. You can get small "set screws" to fill the holes where the studs would go. This prevents the threads getting filled with dirt in case you decide to use them later. $URL$ 

And Yellow Jersey is exactly the kind of shop you'd expect to find that stuff. The one in the image is for Road shoes, but I think could easily be adapted to SPD shoes with some work with a dremel tool. They say they will make a custom cleat for just about any shoe. You do realize that because SPD shoes have the cleats embedded in the outsole, you'll need to at least grind a slot in the tread of the shoe. It occurs to me that just grinding the slot in the tread of the shoe and then grinding off the tabs on a standard SPD cleat would get you pretty close to what is required. 

Your front derailler is not designed to work with 50/34 rings and it may not shift well. The slightly wider gap of a 10 spd crankset may get the 11 speed chain caught in between the chainrings. 

Everyone that rides a light road bike long enough eventually has this happen to them regardless of the bike. It is terrifying and many people never trust their bike again after that, but it's not the bike. Speed wobbles on a bike are always blamed on the components or frame, but are almost always caused by a harmonic interaction between the rider and bicycle. It is certainly possible for there to be a mechanical problem, but if there were it would show up at slow speeds as well. This article explains the mechanism $URL$ The natural reaction when this starts to happen is to grip the bars tighter and that almost always makes the problem worse. If you play around, you can get any reasonably light road bike to shimmy at lower speeds by "shaking" the handlebars. FWIW, I feel like this is much easier on steel alloy bikes than either aluminum or carbon bikes. I think this is due to the better spring response of steel compared to other materials. This is something that is worthwhile to mess around because you'll learn to recognize the initial oscillation and how to damp it out before it becomes dangerous. 

My guess is that if you have 12-28, you might not have a Shimano 9 spd hub. Generally Shimano road clusters top out at 27t. That sounds more campy-like to me. That's the first thing to figure out. Shimano and SRAM clusters are interchangable, Campy are not. If you have a shimano hub, it's very easy to build 'custom' cassettes with Shimano 9spd parts. It's just not cheap. If you've got the tools to remove the cassette, you can get an 14-25 $URL$ and mix and match with your current cassette to get the gears you want. It may be possible to do the same kind of mix/match with campy 9spd cogs, it's just more expensive. You can get 14-28 campy cassettes. $URL$ If you can find them, junior racing cassettes are a good solution. Junior racers have gear limitations so they tend to have clustered but lower gears. Currently they only seem to be available for 10 speed cassettes, but you can get 16-27 cassettes. If you poke around enough on the web, you can find small companies like IRD that will make all kinds of custom cassettes. They aren't cheap though. $URL$ 

The best tires I've ever used for linking up dirt and road in the same ride are Avocet Cross II's. They had a "negative" tread. (i.e. grooves in a mostly slick tire.) Unfortunately, they are no longer made. 

The only study I know of concluded that cross chaining in relatively modern 9spd gear systems at the angles typical of bicycles had no measurable effect on the efficiency of the gearing system. Even back in the bad old days of 52/42 with five cogs in the back, I never worried about cross chaining. Use the gears you like and replace the chain when it starts to show wear and your relatively expensive cogsets will last a very long time. Riding with a worn chain destroys gears, not cross chaining. 

Training plans are all well and good, but the first goal is to be able to ride 9 hrs. There is no substitute for doing long rides to prepare to do a long ride. In my experience, for just developing pure endurance you get 80-90% of your training effect from a long ride. The rest of your training should be focused around reducing the recovery time to enable you to do your next long ride. There are also lot's of logistics around eating and drinking for 9hrs on the bike that you'll have to figure out as well and there is simply no way to know what will work for you without getting some 5-6 hr rides as practice. Given that you'll be inside the next 3 months, you should probably focus on consistency with some intensity work. Do as much cross training as you can. It's very hard mentally to do significant endurance training on trainer. If you can find another activity like XC skiing or a similar winter endurance sport, that would be beneficial. The most important part over the winter is to stay consistant and to not mentally burn out. You want to be raring to go when the weather gets good, not disgusted with riding due to burning out on the trainer. Going to the gym to work on flexibility and core strength is also a good winter activity. 9hr rides will make muscles painful that you normally don't notice riding. Once the weather gets nice start working towards a regular extra long ride at least every 2 weeks, every week would be good if you recovering in that time. Start at 3 hrs and add a half hour until you start to reach a point where you can't recover in time for the next ride. Stay there for a while until you're ready to make the next increment. You'll know you're ready to move to the next level when you're excited to do a long ride, if it starts to feel like a job or an obligation, that's the time to step back. Endurancing training is as much about managing recovery as it is actually training. People with the mindset to enjoy endurance sports rarely have trouble with training, but they almost all struggle with overtraining. Learning when to push through and when to back off takes a very long time. As a relative beginner, I'd urge you to err on the side of caution. Taking a rest week every now and then should be part of your plan. Taking a week off will not significantly affect your fitness at all and might provide suprising benefits. Overtraining that extra week can destroy months of training with injury and illness. 300 km in 9 hrs is a very ambitious goal. If you want to be confident I would want to be doing training rides of at least 6 hrs, 7 or 8 hrs would be better. You'll also need to taper at some point before the event. Plan on at least 2-3 weeks of reduced effort leading up to the race.
