I do not think there exists any single set of simple exercises or advices, which can ease your situation. You have too many and too complicated difficulties. On the other hand, I feel sure you will benefit much from appropriate training. One of my supervisors has confirmed this story: $URL$ I hope, you will get inspiration/understanding for how big difficulties you can overcome, if you really want. Sometimes people ask me how I can afford a personal trainer. I think most people can afford one, if they have to do it. Think about your life in the next five years if you do nothing. A skilled supervisor or personal trainer might heavily improve the quality of your life too. 

Do not regret this break from your weightlifting and take the opportunity to become an even better weightlifter. The trainers I have had, most often has used about half of the workout for yoga exercises to improve flexibility, range, mobility and core strength. Exercises like over-the-head-squats demands extremely high flexibility. You can highly improve quality of your squats by doing air squats in front of a mirror. You can improve your core strength and stability far beyond what you think is possible just by doing functional training and calisthenics - without any equipment. If you can afford a little for a smaller device, I will definitely recommend you a cheap suspension-trainer aka TRX (cheap ones are as good as the expensive ones), which you easily can attach to a door, and sliding exercises like this: $URL$ You can just use floor-cloths for sliding exercises. I use to do so. If you dare to try advanced exercises, Switch ball can take your weightlifting to the next level, but I recommends proper instructions. If you have room for more than that, then get inspiration from crossfit and use sandbags (or water bags), tires, logs, etc. as weights. 

Fasting is overrated and unproductive. I agree with Chris. You want to keep your body in an anabolic state and keep your blood sugar balanced as often as possible. These fasting programs are just a gimmick to sell, e-books, programs, etc. Your fasting for the day should occur when your head hits the pillow for 8 hours. Good luck with your future endeavours, Mike 

You have to sit on the actual seat and see for yourself Jitendra. A good rule of thumb is when you are seated on the bike that one of your legs is able to hang completely straight with no bend and hook into the pedal. Hope that helps, Mike 

You are not going to do any 'damage' to your body or cause your muscles to breakdown. I might do the 'ups' before you run and then walk home afterwards. 

It sounds like your legs have a hard time buffering the lactic acid build up you get from cycling. You might have a lower percentage of slow twitch muscle fibres in your legs than the average person, which could effect your endurance. What about carbohydrate intake ? If you are lacking sufficient glycogen content in your muscles it will definitely have an effect on your performance in any activity. 

Doing something is always infinitely better than doing nothing. On this site, I consistently try to make one tremendously important point; walking is exercise! There's so much to be said for an exercise where you're simply moving, but keeping your back straight, chin up, and your heartrate slightly elevated. If you're able to do this for even 15 minutes per day, you're well on your way. I like to recommend 30 minutes, with the extended caveat that it shouldn't be a part of your work day. For instance, walking back and forth between office cubicles is NOT exercise. But taking a walk outside, in a variety of uphills, downhills and flats, is amazing for you. And it also help with other aspects of your fitness, for instance mentally, but allowing you to clear your mind, get some fresh air, and it can almost be meditative if you'd like it to. 

It's called "Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness" (DOMS), keyword being "Delayed". The soreness is caused by eccentric exercise, that is, exercise consisting of eccentric (lengthening) contractions of the muscle. Isometric (static) exercise causes much less soreness, and concentric (shortening) exercise causes none. It's normal for DOMS to occur a day or two after the training, and last for another day or two. Source: Muscle Soreness and Damage and the Repeated-Bout Effect by Ken Nosaka, PhD. 

Mephisto, I think the front plank and the bridge are great core stability exercises. What I would do is use them as a 'warm up' before you train the compound lifts in your routine. Even though the other exercises you are performing use those muscles, I wouldn't eliminate them from your plan. They still have value. I would add a side plank in there as well. It activates more muscle than the front plank does. Hope that helps, Mike 

Make sure you are giving yourself sufficient rest and recovery time in between your warm up sets so you can get to your true 1 rep max. You should be able to figure it out after 3 tries. 

I am curious as to what others experiences with this training program are. Did you gain the 5-12 lbs of muscle over the 6 week period that promoters such as Charles Poliquin claim to be the norm ? While I realize that the excessive volume is the driving force behind the hypertrophy gains, I am wondering whether a load that equates to 60% of one's 1 rep max will stimulate enough muscle fibres to lead to a significant amount of muscle growth. Looking forward to the responses. 

The body is a funny thing. There is no real way to predict how and where it will store fat. The one observation I have made with my own body is that I typically lose fat first from the places I have most recently put it on. The hardest places to lose it are the places that have had it the longest. I am sure you have heard that you cannot spot reduce. This is very true. I wouldn't sit around worrying about it. Anxiety leads to excess cortisol production which leads to fat gain. Try and get pro-active with your diet and exercise instead. Sitting around thinking never did anyone any good. In terms of the excess skin, that is due to a loss of elasticity. I don't think there is much you can do about that outside of getting a tummy tuck. On a positive note, the leaner you get the less that skin will appear 'loose'. I hope that helps, Mike 

Start doing biceps curls and continue until your biceps feel tired and hurts terrible. Now you know how it feels, when you use your biceps. (You probably already knew that.) Doing exercises known to isolating just one muscle or muscle group let you learn how it feels, when you activate exactly that specific muscle, and this knowledge is easely reused doing more complicated exercises. Using this technic you can learn to feel even small deep muscles covered by larger muscles, like e.g. Gluteus medius. Of course, you need to know isolating exercises, and such exercises can commonly be found in the litterature. 

No. Maltodextrin is absorbed almost as fast as grape sugar aka dextrose aka glucose. It is just an industrial replacement of pure starch. While glucose can be useful for drinks consumed during the games, it is not recommend for restitution. You will need slower carbohydrates preferably combined with smaller amounts of fat and protein to stabilize your blood sugar in the break and last during the next game. Even 150-200 kcal is a "small" meal compared to supposedly 600 kcal burned during the 60 minutes game, your body prefers a stable supply of energy. If you feel like your blood sugar is low right after the game and you need a boost, I will suggest you to eat a banana, which contains about that amount of calories you ask for and small amounts of fat and protein. It is absorbed much faster than whole grain products, but not as fast as maltodextrin dissolved into water. 

Stick with real food. The only time protein powders are useful is post workout. They are highly insulinogenic. So they are not an ideal protein source over the course of the day if you want to stay lean. Stick with chicken, turkey, eggs, beef, dairy (greek yogurt). If you have an aversion to animal products, beans, nuts and legumes are loaded with protein as well, you just need to combine them with grains to get the full compliment of amino acids as they are incomplete on their own. These foods are all loaded with protein and they are much more filling, satisfying and sustaining over the course of the day. Keep it simple and avoid overthinking it. 

Not being able to you in person, it is hard for me to say what this is doing to your body. I can say that after 2 weeks, the majority of your strength gains can be attributed'neural' adaptations. Meaning that your brain has become more efficient at sending messages to the working muscles. After 6 weeks, a higher percentage of your strength gains will be as a result of 'hypertrophy'. Which is an increase in the size of your muscle fibres. Stay the course, be consistent with your training, diet and recovery and should be pleased with your the results. Hope that helps, Mike 

You are doing cardiovascular workouts to improve the transportation of oxygen in your body. When you say a person is in a poor shape, that is he or she becomes breathless just after short time of light physical activities, you actually mean he or she has a poor oxygen transportation. The way you do such workouts is usually by working as hard as possible in the aerobic area to maximize your need for oxygen. You can have a good individual indication of the level of oxygen transportation by measuring the heart rate (HR). Note that you cannot compare the HR of two persons and conclude that the one works harder or has a better oxygen transportation than the other one. If you measure the HR of yourself during a single workout (but not during e.g. a year) it is common to assume that the maximal transportation of oxygen take place when your measure the fastest HR. While it use to be optimal to do exercises with many fast repetitions, you can do literally any exercise you want for cardiovascular workouts. It is just extremely hard to work as hard as maximal oxygen transportation / HR takes place by doing a plank compared to running fast or jumping. That fact leads to a reasonable definition of cardiovascular exercises: Exercises, which makes it easy to push your body to work in such a way, that maximal oxygen transportation takes place. 

I think a lot of it comes down to protein intake. If your calories are low and your protein intake is low, then a lot of your weight loss will come from muscle. If you up your protein and maintain the calories where they at, then you have a fighting chance at losing the majority of your calories from adipose tissue (fat). 

Front planks, side planks, rollouts w/stability ball, barbell or wheel, jackknifes w/stability ball, pikes with stability ball, front plank/stir the pot on stability ball. 

I would keep your protein shakes to post workout only. Whey protein is highly insulinogenic. So it is the ideal choice to drink after you train, but you don't need to drink shakes during the course of the day. Stick to eating whole foods, Meat, eggs, yogurt, beans, nuts, etc. Whole foods will keep you fuller and keep your blood sugar balanced throughout the day. If you are really concerned about staying anabolic throughout the day, buy some BCAA's (branched chain amino acids, valine, leucine and isoleucine) and take 5 grams with water every couple of hours. Definitely take 5 grams pre, peri and post workout as well. I hope that helps. Mike 

If you are not feeling pain, there is no reason to be concerned. Dip belts are good, you can also buy a weighted vest. That way the weight is more evenly distributed. 

You're getting caught up in details. I doubt even the creator of the program can tell you why the dumbbell press is between two barbell presses. Sure, you should do all of them, but you should also do a large number of other pressing exercises and variations and orders. So the order s/he presents is good. 

I think all your reasons are valid reasons to lose motivation, and you have to tackle each one independently. But you have to remember one of the fundamental rules of success in anything, including your gym ventures: Motivation is going to the gym because you look forward to it, and enjoy it. The downside to relying on motivation, is that it is a fleeting emotion, and one that is hard to invoke on command. Most often, you find motivation in periods before the work, and find it disappearing as soon as the time comes to put in the work. Discipline is going to the gym even though you don't look forward to it, or enjoy it. This is predicated on the idea that you are able to do hard work for delayed gratification. I.e. you won't be feeling good there and then, but you're hard set on reaping the rewards later on. The bottom line is, if you have periods of low motivation, you need to rely on discipline to get your ass back in the gym, lest you end up not going at all. But discipline is hard to come by. Discipline means acting against your own wishes for the right now, in order to get paid later. And in the end, since we all experience lack of motivation, it's discipline that separates us from those who never go to the gym at all. The same goes for anything where you need to put in work. If you take anything at all away from this post, let it be this: Delayed gratification! If you learn to appreciate working for delayed gratification rather than instant gratification, you'll be fine.
