If you can settle for complex numbers, then there is the following simple argument. By the symmetry of the Hodge numbers, you have that $\dim H^p(X,\mathcal{O}_X) = \dim H^0(X,\Omega^p_X)$. So it suffices to show that the latter numbers are birational invariants. But whenever $X\to Y$ is birational, then its locus of indeterminacy has codimension at least two. On the other hand, Hartog's extension lemma says that functions (hence also p-forms) can be extended to the whole space if they are defined off a codimension two subset. One concludes that any birational map induces an isomorphism of global sections of the sheaf of p-forms, so we are done. 

Let $A$ be an associative algebra, $M$ a right $A$-module. Suppose we are given an $A$-module homomorphism $M \to A$. Then we can make $M$ itself into an associative algebra via the multiplication $$ M \otimes M \to M \otimes A \to M.$$ The same construction works if $A$ and $M$ are cochain complexes, ie when $A$ is a dg algebra. In this case one can moreover prove that the construction is well defined on the level of the derived category: if $f,g \colon M \to A$ are chain maps that are equal in the derived category, then the resulting dg-algebra structures on $M$ are quasi-isomorphic. This seems like a natural enough construction that it has been studied before. Does it have a name? Is there a reference in the literature to the claim that this is well defined in the derived category? 

The answer to the main question above is indeed positive: the restriction map is nonzero for all $k \geq 2$. This was proved in Section 5 of my paper Tautological rings of spaces of pointed genus two curves of compact type. Compos. Math. 152 (2016), no. 7, 1398–1420. The idea of the calculation is that these are Eisenstein cohomology classes for the Siegel parabolic subgroup, which corresponds to the 0-dimensional boundary strata in the Baily-Borel compactification. Therefore one can reduce to a calculation on a deleted neighborhood of the 0-dimensional part of the boundary. Such a deleted neighborhood can be described as a fiber bundle over a smaller locally symmetric space. In the end one ends up changing the problem from considering the submanifold $A_1 \times A_1 \subset A_2$ to considering the submanifold inside $A_1$ given by the image of the imaginary axis. This is equivalent to reformulating the problem as an assertion about classical modular symbols. 

Yes, this is still true, if we assume that $E$ is the underlying local system of a polarized variation of Hodge structure on $\overline X$, which takes care of most local system of "algebro-geometric origin". Deligne's result comes from a combination of the following three results: 

Yes, this is true. See Albrecht Dold, "Homology of symmetric products and other functors of complexes", Ann. of Math. (1958). 

Update: The relative formality theorem mentioned above has since been improved by Tourtchine and Willwacher $URL$ : the same conclusion holds for any $m \geq n+2$. So this covers in particular the case you care(d) about. Moreover, their result is sharp, in the sense that relative formality fails when $m=n+1$. To my knowledge the only nontrivial case where all the higher components of this $\infty$-morphism have been worked out is for $e_1$ mapping into the framed little disks, which is due to Alm $URL$ The "correction terms" end up being expressed in terms of period integrals on the moduli spaces $M_{0,n}$, and thus (using the work of Brown) in terms of multiple zeta values. 

In this paper of Deligne and Mumford they define the notion of a stack. This is a generalization of the notion of a scheme, introduced to accomodate moduli problems where the objects parametrized have automorphisms. For a (non-)example, the Grassmannian is the moduli space parametrizing $k$-dimensional subspaces of a fixed vector space $V$; the fact that $V$ is fixed menas that such a subspace has no automorphisms, which explains morally why the moduli space is a scheme in this case. However, curves often do have nontrivial automorphisms, and for this reason the moduli functor of curves is a stack, not a scheme. The notion of stack introduced in their paper is what's now called a Deligne-Mumford stack. These are the stacks closest to ordinary schemes. The important property of a Deligne-Mumford stack is that the automorphism group of any object is finite. Now the automorphism group of a smooth genus $g$ curve is finite if and only if $g \geq 2$, and this is why they make this assumption. It is common to also consider curves with marked points. These are parametrized by a moduli space $M_{g,n}$. More generally, a curve of genus $g$ with $n$ markings has finite automorphism group if and only if $2g-2+n >0$, and the stacks $M_{g,n}$ are of Deligne-Mumford type if and only if this inequality is satisfied. There is a more general notion of Artin stack, which accomodates also infinite stabilizer groups. If you don't mind working with Artin stacks then the moduli spaces $M_{g,n}$ for $2g-2+n \leq 0$ are perfectly sensible objects to consider, too. 

The answer is yes. This is because these groups are fundamental groups of complements of fiber-type hyperplane arrangements; the fact that such groups are residually torsion free nilpotent goes back to Falk and Randell. Indeed we are considering the fundamental group of the moduli space $M_{0,n}$ of genus zero Riemann surfaces with $n$ distinct ordered marked points. Since the group of Möbius transformations acts 3-transitively on the Riemann sphere, we can take the first three markings to be $0,1,\infty$. This identifies $M_{0,n}$ with the space $$\{(x_1,\ldots,x_{n-3}) \in \mathbf C^{n-3} : x_i \neq x_j, x_i \neq 0, x_i \neq 1 \text{ for all }i,j\},$$ which is of the required form. 

Am I missing something? The group $M(0,2g+2)$ is the fundamental group of the quotient $X_{2g+2}/\operatorname{PGL}_2$ (which exists as a manifold/algebraic variety and can be identified with the configuration space of $2g-1$ distinct ordered points in $\mathbf P^1\setminus \{0,1,\infty\}$). Then $\pi_1(X_n) \to \operatorname{Sp}_{2g}(\mathbf Z)$ factors through $M(0,2g+2)$ because the universal family of hyperelliptic curves is $\operatorname{PGL}_2$-invariant. 

One can define the Chow groups of a Chow motive $M$ by the formulas $$ \newcommand{\Hom}{\mathrm{Hom}}\newcommand{\L}{\mathbb{L}} \newcommand{\Ch}{\mathrm{CH}} \Ch^s(M) = \Hom(M,\L^s) $$ and $$ \Ch_s(M) = \Hom(\L^s,M).$$ Here $\L = H^2(\mathbf P^1).$ A reference for this definition is e.g. Scholl's text in the first Motives volume. When $M$ is the motive of a smooth projective variety $X$, then $\Ch^s X = \Ch^s M$ etc. But I must confess that I don't see why the definition of $\mathrm{Ch}(M)$ given in the question is consistent with this. 

abx has basically answered your question in a comment, but let me add some detail. There is no natural such direct sum decomposition; you are probably thinking of the Bloch-Beilinson filtration on Chow groups, whose existence in general is only conjectural. A very nice reference is a paper by Jannsen in one of the "Motives" volumes. There are some examples where the conjectural filtration is expected to split, so that one really gets a direct sum decomposition. If $X$ is an abelian variety, then there is the Beauville decomposition of the Chow ring, which is defined unconditionally using the Fourier transform. It gives rise to a graduation (as opposed to a filtration) on Chow groups, satisfying all expected properties of the BB filtration except a conjectural vanishing property. A conjecture of Beauville predicts that for any hyperkähler variety $X$, the Bloch-Beilinson filtration on the Chow groups of $X$ splits. Here a direct sum decomposition satisfying all expected properties was constructed by Beauville and Voisin in the case of a K3 surface. 

One application is Deligne's theorem on the degeneration of the Leray spectral sequence. Strictly speaking this is not an interesting fact about smooth projective varieties but about families of smooth projective varieties, and their relative cohomology $\mathrm R^if_\ast \mathbf Q$. More precisely, the result is that for $f \colon X \to S$ a smooth and projective morphism of $\mathbf C$-varieties, there is an isomorphism $$ \mathrm Rf_\ast\mathbf Q \cong \bigoplus_i \mathrm R^i f_\ast\mathbf Q[-i]$$ in the derived category of $S$. In particular, the Leray spectral sequence $E_2^{pq} = H^p(S,\mathrm R^q f_\ast \mathbf Q) \implies H^{p+q}(X)$ degenerates, but the derived category result is "universal". The proof is very formal and the key idea is the existence of a Lefschetz operator and a decomposition into primitive parts on the relative cohomology. Deligne's paper is very readable: Théorème de Lefschetz et critères de dégénérescence de suites spectrales 

It shouldn't be hard to adapt the proof for unpointed curves. The idea is the following. If $\newcommand \G {\mathcal G} \G$ is a sheaf of groups on $X$, say a topological space, then $H^1(X,\G)$ always classifies isomorphism classes of "locally trivial things over $X$ such that their sheaf of automorphisms over $X$ coincides with $\G$". Example: if $G$ is a finite group, then $H^1(X,G)$ classifies $G$-torsors over $X$. The proof is purely formal and is easiest to carry out in Cech cohomology. Let's say deformations = 1st order deformations to avoid repeating myself. All deformations of smooth affine varieties are trivial. This means that deformations of any smooth variety are locally trivial, and so can be classified by their sheaf of automorphisms as above. An automorphism of a trivial deformation is the same thing as an infinitesimal automorphism which (on a smooth variety) is the same thing as a vector field (a section of $T_X$). So $H^1(X,T_X)$ classifies isomorphism classes of deformations of $X$. Now do the same thing for infinitesimal automorphisms that fix the $p_i$. This is the same thing as a vector field which vanishes at each $p_i$, which is the same as a section of $T_X(-p_1-\ldots -p_n)$. Intuitively (differential-geometrically) this is clear: a vector field on a manifold is an infinitesimal automorphism because you can flow along it, and this flow fixes precisely those points where the vector field vanishes. This assertion is enough to finish the proof. So I would look at how Hartshorne identifies automorphisms of $X \times_k k[\varepsilon]$ over $X$ with sections of $T_X = \mathrm{Hom}(\Omega^1,\mathcal O_X) = \mathrm{Der}(\mathcal O_X,\mathcal O_X)$ and modify that proof to take into account that the automorphism should fix a number of points. 

To me it seems most natural to show that the norm determines the scalar product via the two formulas $$\Vert u + v \Vert^2 = \Vert u \Vert^2 + \Vert v \Vert^2 + 2\mathrm{Re}\langle u, v \rangle$$ and $$\mathrm{Im} \langle u, v \rangle = \mathrm{Re}\langle u, -iv \rangle.$$ Both of these are immediately obvious, in a way the polarization identities are not (IMO). 

Yes, $M_{1,n}$ is affine. More generally, $M_{g,n+1}\to M_{g,n}$ is an affine morphism for any $n \geq 1$. 

Addendum, Jan 23 2013. Sorry if it is poor form to bump an inactive question only to advertise your own work, but I just ran across this old question. When I had thought some more about this I realized eventually that what I described above is really a special case of the notion of a colored PROP/operad, except the collection of colors do not form a set but a category. In this case there is only one color but its automorphism group is $G$, that is, the collection of colors is exactly the one-object category corresponding to the group $G$. The notion of a PROP/operad which is colored by a category is defined in my paper $URL$ . This is actually somewhat more general than what Salvatore and Wahl define, even when the category in question is a group. 

I don't know much about these things but I think 1. fails even if $X$ is a point and $Y$ is a line. Let's say also $R$ is a field. Then the category of constructible sheaves on $X$ is just $R$-Vect which is in particular semisimple, but the category of constructible sheaves on $Y$ is not semisimple: if we choose a sheaf on a point $p$ and on the complement $U$ of that point, then there are in general many non-isomorphic choices of a sheaf on $Y$ with given restrictions to $p$ and $U$ which fit in a short exact sequence. So their derived categories are not equivalent either.
