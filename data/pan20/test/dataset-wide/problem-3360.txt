One example is the evidence for bǎ becoming generalized as a focused object-marker in Chinese. Post suggests that the points noted above: 

In a way, yes. The thing about mass nouns is that the things they refer to are usually inherently plural/collective/inseparable, like flour, milk, dust, and grass. Those things are most commonly encountered or discussed as, well, masses of a given substance, rather than individual pieces of said substance. So, it would be somewhat unusual for a language to explicitly mark the 'mass' form of a mass noun, because that would suggest that 'a drop of milk' is the run-of-the mill, everyday way of talking about milk, while 'many drops of milk as one mass' needs to be explicitly indicated because your audience couldn't assume that's what you meant. In effect, you would end up with a similar system to the singular vs. plural marking that happens for count nouns, and it would erode an existing distinction between mass nouns and count nouns. So instead, what some languages do is mark the singulative form of a mass noun, which means basically that there is a marked form of the noun to indicate when it is a piece/part of the unmarked mass noun. In English, we can only do this in a roundabout way: a grain of rice vs. rice, but if we had a singulative marker, say *-op, we could just say *ricop and rice, in the same way as in Bari, you have lɛ-tat 'a drop of milk' and lɛ 'milk'. A system like this means that, although the mass form of the mass noun is unmarked, mass nouns have their own specific morphology as opposed to count nouns, so are easily distinguished from count nouns (unlike in English, where mass nouns don't take any special morphemes). Singulative marking is encountered as part of the tripartite number marking patterns found in many Nilo-Saharan and Niger-Congo languages. A tripartite number system exhibits three principles of number indication, namely pluralisation, singulativisation, and substitution of number morphemes, as discussed in this paper on Western Nilotic noun morphology by Storch (2007). Here is an example from Anywa (Anuak) from Reh 1996 but reproduced by Storch: 

I used to start learning a few languages, admittingly my interest ,stamina and brain force didn't last for more than a couple of days each. Nethertheless, I noticed , that the different grammars explained clauses being divided into Subject and Verbs as their minimal requirements. Now, Subject is a sentence part and verb is a part of speach, furthermore other definitions of clauses name Subject and Predicative as the minimal requirements for a clause , which is a blessing feeling of absence of cognitive dissonance since in this case both are sentence parts. But why is it so? 

At this point I don't want to explain my personal crackpot theories on how names for numbers emerged and I assume that anything remotely connected with the origin of language is highly speculative and hard if not impossible being researched empirically. Nethertheless, centuries of speculation might have culminated into a few theories which might be considered an educated guess or even more. Here I limit the theories onto the origin of the names for numerals, what probably doesn't make it much easier. 

In korean, consonants are divided into three categories of articulation or coarticulation, one of them is called Tenseness. In korean orthography, tensed consonants are written with a reduplicated consonant sign. In IPA orthography, they are written with a pair of vertical parallel lines at the bottom of the letter: 

I understand the field or fields have to be quiet extensive, therefore I don't ask for a description, but rather a list of the names of the linguistic subfields, theories and significant people dealing with it, maybe with short annotations. 

Now I don't know if this contradicts some basic principle in linguistics, but a friend of mine,Aslan, who admittingly tends to be a crackpot, but has also proven to be smart, claims, that this is the case in one of the Balkan languages he speaks. The example I provide is necessarily just wrong grammar I had to make up, to exemplify what I mean. 

In the movie Prometheus, David, an Android tasked with maintaining the functions on the space ship while his human comrades are sleeping in cryostatic chambers, is learning PIE during his off-duty time. In one sequence he is repeating after his holographic teacher a text in PIE. One sound in the word akwunsez sounds odd, it sounds like some one is beat boxing, a sound generated with probably only the larynx and its epiglottal membranes in a loud way. You can hear it here, about the time stamp of 1:10 David is beat boxing very ancient lyrics Is this sound one of the exotic ones I asked about , are there more ? 

He then goes on to suggest that there might be a stronger correlation between more compounding and 'deeper' grammaticalization; the obsolescence of basic source lexemes for the grammaticalizing forms (the source lexemes typically being replaced by compounds) might actually encourage the partially grammaticalized versions to shed their lexical-like attributes, and allow behavioural restrictions to become more firmly established. There are other hints of similar observations around, but these sorts of things can be very difficult to tease out in the early (or mid-term) stages, and require a lot of data, so I think it will be some time before we know for sure whether some of these languages are becoming more agglutinating. Seeing as there is really no such thing as a purely isolating language, we also can't know for sure whether some of these languages are on their way to becoming more or less isolating - they might not be ready to move on to agglutinating if they're not done with the isolating stage! 

And you can see that in this, the mass/collective noun 'butter' is unmarked for the collective form but marked for the singulative formation, with distinct morphology from the plural formation and the 'replacement pattern'. In the example given above, and others typical of the tripartite system, for a noun like 'bell' the underlying form is a singular, with a morphologically complex plural, while the morphologically unmarked and thus underlying form of ‘butter’ is plural/collective/mass both grammatically and semantically. A singulative noun is typically a word that denotes an item that is singled out from a mass or group of similar items. Items that normally occur in pairs or larger numbers are expressed by nouns that are semantically and grammatically plural or collective and morphologically not overtly marked. For a noun like 'loincloth', with the 'replacement pattern', both forms a morphologically complex, and neither may be underlying. Of course, the semantic distinctions made by speakers of a particular language are crucial to determining how a noun is treated for number marking. This is discussed quite a bit in this paper by Dimmendaal on number marking and noun classification in Nilo-Saharan (2000) (access via an institution). He argues that that there is a continuum between 'object' and 'substance', with the end points of this continuum being universally distinguished (i.e. the most 'county' count nouns and the most 'massy' mass nouns), but with intermediate cases being "linguistically malleable" across languages. This is not just true for, say, Nilo-Saharan languages compared to Indo-European languages - it can be true for even very closely related languages, because there is an enormous amount of variation in how these systems work (particularly in the parts of Africa relevant to the Niger-Congo and Nilo-Saharan language groupings, where there are large amounts of linguistic transfer between languages which are geographically close but genetically distant). Dimmendaal also gives examples from some other languages which show structural similarities to the the singulative marking patterns in the tripartite systems of Nilo-Saharan, such as Russian gorox 'peas', gorošina 'pea'. In the Native American language Kiowa, nouns which are inherently singular or dual take a number suffix to mark plural, while other nouns which are inherently dual or plural ('bone', 'rib', 'wing') take a singulative marker. So, basically, mass nouns are 'marked', or indicated, by virtue of being morphologically unmarked but having a clear singulative counterpart, and unique noun morphology. The above points do not take into account the complex interactions between noun classifier systems and number marking in Nilo-Saharan languages, nor external ways of indicating the 'mass-ness' of a noun (the classificatory verbs discussed by @Daniel Briggs) - there are also many other ways to indicate this beyond the noun morphology. 

In another question someone pointed out, that at least some slavic languages use word order to express the grammatical category of definitiveness. For instance in Polish: This example has been flagged by some as incorrect, but my expertise is too limited to evaluate 

Let me clarify the question, There are traditional grammars to describe the working and structure of languages, mostly with the purpose of teaching someone to speak the languages. So, it is approach is simply educative and theoretical inconsistencies within the grammar used are neglected , it only has to work as a teaching instrument. Then, there are descriptions of languages with the purpose of describing them for further linguistic evaluations. Maybe to have a common system of description to compare languages with one another, to group them according to some criteria, to follow their development through time by observing its change of grammar, to describe their structure precisely for computational evaluation and so forth. Now, at this point I don't know how deep an answer to this question can get, if it is too comprehensive, please try to point out some relevant differences. 

As for the languages I know I think to believe, that a subordinated clause comes in a chunk and not scattered throughout the main clause. For instance: 

Do you know futher examples of languages with free word order, highly flectional languages like Balto-Slavic, Ancient Greek or Sanskrit or agglutinative languages like Korean and Japanese with a free word order except for the predicate or others that use word order to convey some additional meaning? 

Is there a field of linguistics which deals with analyzing them and establishing grammatical characteristics for each type of text. Maybe, after a statistical evaluation of text types and comparison with each other one could come up with stable or frequent characteristics for each text type, perhaps differences like: 

According to the definition I read on anaphors, it is an expression, which refers back to a word. As examples what this anaphoras can be I was given a pronoun and adverb: Anaphor realized by a pronoun: 

The idea that literacy may slow the process of language change has been around for a while, but as far as I know there is no comprehensive study of this, partly because there are lots of issues with finding groups which are otherwise comparable except for literacy rates. There is a key paper on the topic called Literacy as a Factor in Language Change (Zengel 1962) which hypothesizes about this but doesn't actually provide any real evidence for it - Zengel is basically surprised by the higher-than-expected rate of retention of vocabulary items in a small sample of English and Latin over 1000 years, and suggests that this could be because literacy was primary and integral in these languages and therefore added extra stability. This study excluded natural phonetic change and structural change in the words because, of course, this was rampant, so Zengel just looked at word stems. (A glance at just about any English sentence is good evidence for the fact that sound change stampedes on ahead, regardless of spelling systems). Some arguments against the literacy-slows-change idea are contained in Chapter 3 of this book on Literacy and Lexical Diffusion. It's an accessible discussion, basically arguing that literacy actually introduces rapid and widespread language change, and that literacy itself is diverse and variable rather than uniform and stable. Furthermore, even in so-called literate cultures, widespread literacy is generally still a relatively recent phenomenon. An additional point to think about is all of the types of changes that can be observed in English usage through the use of new digital mediums of communication - these occur very rapidly, directly mediated by literacy. 

@hippietrail, re: your query about which language the documentation should actually begin in, it's generally thought that your work is most valid if all of the data are collected through the actual language you are documenting. This means that you can either essentially start out 'mute', and learn from scratch, or try to learn some of the language before you start the project. This is all well and good, but for languages that are under-documented (or undocumented), you would be lucky to find sufficient materials available to help you learn the language on your own, before going into the field. So, mostly, people will first learn the lingua franca of the area - if you plan to work on a small native language of Africa, the lingua franca might be Arabic, French, English, or a dominant native language like Kiswahili. And yes, in Australia, the lingua franca might be Kriol. Then, ideally, you'd gradually learn the language you are actually documenting, and use this to verify data you already have, and continue collecting more. In reality, this situation won't always work - it's far more time consuming for the linguist if it's necessary to get an extra language or two under your belt before getting down to the nuts and bolts of documentation, and funding might not always allow for those extra few months as a learner. Not all language documentation entails years spent working on the one language - sometimes an opportunity arises to just work on a language for a short time, or on a specific feature, and it's important to make the most of these opportunities because some documentation is still better than no documentation. In those situations, you might be more likely to end up working with educated speakers who are as fluent in English (or any given language) as you, and that's ok too, as long as you're aware of the possible pitfalls of the 'translation method'.
