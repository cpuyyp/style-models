Storing Nitroglycerin You don't store it as straight liquid nitroglycerin. You're an animal! You need to be able to run, jump, fall, etc. without exploding body parts. So, what do you store instead of nitroglycerin? First, let me introduce you to guncotton, aka nitrocellulose. It is chemically very similar to nitroglycerin, but a lot more stable. It was even, for a long time, the primary military explosive substance. If you mix nitroglycerin and guncotton, you can get a double-base explosive powder. Aka, modern smokeless gunpowder. The advantages of storing your nitroglycerin mixed with guncotton as an explosive powder should be obvious. Explosive, yes, but stable under ordinary conditions. Ignition temperature is hundreds of degrees. Can be shaken as much as you want. Unfortunately, figuring out how to create double-base explosive powder is beyond my chemistry knowledge. If I remember tonight, I will try to google around for it, but searching "how to make gunpowder" at work seems like it might not be the best idea. 

If we knew, we wouldn't need spells The thing about what we do to animals, is that we don't really know how they feel about it. Many people honestly say that they don't believe animals can suffer or feel pain, and that's why it's all justified. Others enjoy the benefit of the doubt. If we could speak to animals, we could know for sure how they feel and decide accordingly. A moving speech from a cow would probably make many people go vegan (others would argue that these animals wouldn't even be born if it wasn't for us needing them for food). If they turn out to be feeling-less, we would use them even more. So the real question is, what would they say. What would they say? I believe what they would say is exactly what they say now, in actions and demeanor. When my dog says "woof" I know what she means. It's not complex ideas, mostly emotions and basic needs. I doubt an animal would evolve the complex skills of symbolic thinking without being able to use it. I also highly doubt that they can express emotions without feeling them, as some think (I doubt that's even logically possible) So lab animals would probably say "I'm scared", "I'm in pain", "I don't like the person in the white coat" etc. Nothing we couldn't have guessed already. To conclude 

They all omnivorous creatures, and have enough food on their respective living environment, and anyway would get few - but still a little bit of - food from another living environment. Their environment fit quite good for their respective natural liver, but they wouldn't be able to live in another. (As humans wouldn't have any reason to prefer to live underwater rather than on ground) So they basically don't have any good reason to colonize another living environment. They have all the same aggressiveness and imperialism level: the one of human kind. My question is: as none of them is a direct threat for the others, at least not for territory quest, what their relations would be ? Would one of their kind seek more wars with themselves or with one of the two other civilization ? 

They don't filter, so they don't hear while flying. To not hear is obviously a weakness, as they couldn't hear neither close predators noises, nor shout from other species member that would want to yield a danger. However, to fly is a much better advantage. For small animals of this size, there are many carnivorous animals stuck on ground that would stop to be a threat as long as they are airborne. And even if the noise would probably alert and attract many other predators around, your creature would simply have to fly on an upper position, like a tree, to be safe for a while. In order to communicate together while flying, maybe they could develop a new form of language rather than noises. They can for instance develop a 3D movement code, like bees waggle dance. 

Suppose I'm a rich, well-connected psychological scientist with a lot of spare time, and I'm sick of WEIRD science. 

By the courtesy of the other dead I don't know if all cultures believe in souls ascending to heaven, so relying on your enemies in battle may not be wise. However, since not all your dead are trapped (those who are reachable can be helped), it could be a matter of courtesy in those cultures to not ascend the minute you are free, but have a look around, especially in times of war, for fellow souls which are trapped and free them before you go. Army units in particular can have it planned ahead that everyone who dies makes sure all the others are alive or descended. 

Fake knows doesn't hold forever, but since time is of the essence it could help. It also won't work in high profile cases where a team of well trusted hindsighters could verify exactly what happened, but it should at least give any culprit some hope of getting away with stuff given a good lawyer. 

So magic can be used to improve technology. To make and use a research laboratory on any science topic is really easier than in your world than in our. 

So finally, I think magic and technology can help each other to progress. They are complementary, as technology is longer to prepare for usage but magic is an energy eater. So yes, technology and science shall evolve to modern standards, and probably further. 

The scenario is the following: a civilization with technology level similar to humanity's current, on a planet similar to Earth, shall be hit by a massive celestial body in approximately one year. The impact would be around three times more powerful than the one that caused the end of dinosaurs, but still not enough to completely destroy the planet. The civilization know about it one year before impact, and know precisely when and where it would crash. My question is: what would be the best way to save as most people as possible ? Is there a way to destroy the asteroid ? or at least to damage it and reduce the impact strength ? Else, what kind of preparations could be efficient, for the impact itself as well as adaptation to what the planet and its life forms would become after it ? Is there a chance of long-term survival at all ? I wonder as much for the explosion (or waves, depending if the asteroid crash on land or on ocean) as for consequences for potential survivors: animal and vegetable kingdom would be shaken, so if a large group survives, could a civilization rebuild just after? 

Animals see "visible" light via rods and cones, and humans have 3 different types of cones to see different wavelength ranges (i.e., colors) of light. Tetrachromacy is condition where an animal has four different types of cones. This fourth type of cone does not expand the visual spectrum, but can allow better discrimination of colors within it. So. @AndreiROM wonders why you couldn't fit all 3 sets in one pair of eyes, and the answer to that is simple: real estate. Eyes are packed full of as many rods and cones as can fit. While there's 3 (or 4) types of cones, they all sample a narrow, overlapping spectrum. If you wanted to pack two more wavelength ranges in, you'd have to cut your cell density for each spectrum to 1/3. Or, have different pairs of eyes. But, this creates significant problems. First and foremost, 3 independently functioning eye pairs means 3 independently functioning visual cortices in the brain. The visual cortex is a significant proportion of the brain, so replicating it a bunch is going to make things pretty screwy. Even with two eyes, our cortex has a tendency to cheat and only actually process one eye and only occasionally sample the other. So, we cheat. One visual cortex. Slightly expanded because some additional complexity is unavoidable. But, we only use one pair of eyes at a time. That way, the cortex won't get overloaded. Since we're on completely separate wavelength ranges, having all three overlap at once wouldn't be terribly useful anyway (it would be like looking at one of those 3D eye puzzles when you haven't seen it yet). Why would they overlap? One visual cortex; this is the price we pay for not being a bobble-head. This adds some interesting elements to the system. Under normal circumstances, one of these humanoids would only have one set of eyes open at a time, and the other two closed. This is because having unused eyes closed protects them, and it's also the simplest "off" switch. It also gives them the ability, in certain, very specific circumstances, to open multiple sets and overlay the information, if that does become advantageous. Imagine trying to code break a message that requires you to see in 3 wavelength ranges at once when you have just the one pair of eyes. But now we're back to... why do they need three sets of eyes to begin with? Visual wavelength ranges are certainly a possibility, but you'll need to find a dire biological reason for them to need eyes that can see in those wavelength ranges. Maybe there's areas of poison gas that can only be seen in ultraviolet. Maybe their prey can't be seen at night except infrared. Anything that can only be seen in a particular range and seeing it would vastly increase either survival or mating chance will exert evolutionary pressure on developing a system to see in that wavelength range. While they are predators, something to consider is that there are very few species that nothing kills, particularly since most species are willing to kill members of their own species. That means defensive abilities are still important. In this case, whatever the outside set of eyes, those are your "prey" eyes (the eyes that are most useful when something is hunting you). They have a much wider field of view, but much smaller binocular overlap, which means they're good at noticing things from more directions, but bad at focusing on them. There are alternatives, most notably spatial frequency, but either way would work if you apply the appropriate evolutionary pressures. 

I've got a planet similar to Earth, with three species rising from prehistoric nomadic life to sedentary civilizations at the same time and learning speed, but in three different living environments: 

Religions were made in ancient ages and earned their "success" partially by bringing two kind of answers that couldn't be found at these times, like how the world was created, how human race emerged, etc. With a 24th century technology and knowledge level, it would be hard to do the same, especially for an AI, that would be more rational than a human and would prefer have a scientific answer than anything else to a problem. However, a religion derivative that made victims since antiquity has still success today: sects. The main difference is that their leaders don't even trust themselves their own directives, but use it on credulous people to steal their money and/or freedom. This strategy could be used on artificial intelligences. On two ways: By humans A human - or group of humans - could persuade an AI for anything to be true, by hacking or manipulation, and convince it to do anything. It can then use it as bodyguards or slaves if AI think this human is a divine entity, or, in a better way, make it think that its only purpose is to serve humans and to never attack them. So this strategy could be used as well for a good purpose as for a bad one. By another AI Some humans manipulate other ones and persuaded them to do absolutely anything they want. It is possible for a smart and resourceful AI, with probably high hacking skills, to do the same with its fellows. This time, it would probably be for the worst: an AI starting to manipulate other ones for its own purposes is probably a rogue one, and it looks like a good start for a science-fiction story scenario. 

Let's think about this from a human perspective. After a certain age, all women are infertile. While not as striking an event as menopause, men's fertility declines precipitously as well. If these people were still evolutionarily "useless", one would think evolution would put in a kill switch so they weren't a drain on resources, but that is demonstrably not the case. So, what use, evolutionarily, is a post-child creation human? 

The bad news: nearly all vegetation in the area is going to die out. When talking about what would not be available, it's actually easier to say what would still be available; we're talking about a complete ecological collapse scenario. 

A person born without "the normal five" senses would die in under a week due to lack of food, since they would not be able to eat. Even with extreme medical intervention, their lifespan would be, at best, months. Digging deeper, someone with no senses probably wouldn't be able to contract any muscles, including smooth muscles. If you're lucky (if), the heart beats. Even then, if you got food into their stomach, they wouldn't be able to force it through their intestines in a normal fashion. Hormone levels would not be properly regulated, including hormones that would be immediately deadly if unbalanced (like insulin). Assuming this baby even made it to term (because of the stabilizing influence of the mother), it would be a still-birth. 

I think this is a key point. The weakest men and women would feel useless if they cannot try something else than magic. So I think they would be the best engineers/scientists, eager to prove their values. They would use their little power to increase their potential and making experiences to make technology progress. 

Hide the sun. If you find a way to completely block the sunlight to shine on a planet, you can be sure every life form should disappear quickly. 

... Where technology doesn't. Take one of the technology improvement that ended the middle age: navigation. If I understand your world, magic can be used to cross large water bodies. But to travel - and transport commodities - through oceans is not at all a "simple things", so if it is possible, it would be only by the magic masters of your world. On the opposite, a caravel made by engineers (who, once again, could have used magic to make it) would be able to travel as many times as it want with less energy. And on board, sailors can use their own power to make the ship travel faster, or the travel itself more comfortable by making food appear, etc. 

They are not really fire-proof Much like ruining a dishwasher with water, you can burn a dragon with fire - if you direct it to a weak spot. There's no reason why the outer belly of the dragon should be fire proof. Also, when it breathes fire, the fire doesn't stay close too long. It's most likely created outside the body. Fire is much more dangerous when someone pushes it at you. 

You don't know this, but in the program that is your consciousness there are break points. I.e., points in which the program stops, and you have a chance to reflect on it and perhaps change it. The way this works is that you suddenly have an out-of-body experience, in which you realize that time has stopped and you have an ability to change certain things about yourself (see details below). You know that once you 'resume' yourself you will forget that this ever happened, and you don't remember it ever happening before although you are aware it's possible that it had. What you can do:
