There are several differences between a plain cotton t-shirt and a cycling jersey. @Mac has already highlighted the sweat wicking potential. Some jerserys are tailored, so they'll certainly be more comfortable and possible aero-dynamic. After all a tight t-shirt won't necessarily be worse aero-dynamically - it might flap around less, aside from the different flow properties of the chosen materials. Many jerseys have other attributes though: pockets, zips, reflective strips, longer backs - all of these things might help make other aspects of your attire more stream-lined. 

You have two choices - many manufacturers have their own branded racks, in which case, as you're buying new, you might want to try to get the sales rep to throw in a set at no extra cost. Possibly a better thought is to have a target brand and model of rack in mind. For instance, I have a Thule set, which works by having two bars straddling the roof of the car, with the bike racks bridging between the bars. The bars attach to the car with model-specific 'feet' which are easily disengaged from the bars. So it is possible to use the same bars and racks (and boxes and so on) on different cars, just by removing the feet and replacing them with alternatives. (I've loaned my bars and racks to friends in this way.) All you need to make sure of here is that the model-specific options are available for your car - and the manufacturer's website should help with that. Indeed, the rep who sold me my most recent purchase was able to give me the Thule part number! If there are practical reasons why a roof set up isn't going to work for a particular model (e.g. it's an open top) then there are alternatives around rear-mounted racks (although many of these are dependent on a tow hook). 

Do a lap of 20km together then Ken can carry on and meet back at home/wherever after completing his ride, considering that lighter 20km as a nice sociable warm up. (The alternative would be for Ken to ride 40km hard, first, then meet to use the 20 as a warm-down.) Maybe ride the opening 20km together, then Ken leaves Barbie at a suitable café, she can relax, have a drink and recover for a while, Ken spins off and rides hard, and comes back at the cafe, they ride home together at Barbie's pace. Over time, stop at different cafés according to Barbie's preference for the opening spin and the closing warm down. You both get to visit different cafés and neither of you get stuck in a rut of particular distances! 

To be honest, I think you handled the situation pretty well as it was. You've got to get yourself to the bottom of the mountain safely and even in locales which have laws about deliberately impeding following road users you will have to allow people to pass in a manner safe for you, this isn't necessarily going to be immediately. Seems to me that this particular cyclist was just a little too impatient - he'd almost certain have yelled something at you if you'd pulled straight over the moment you'd seen him. Your responsibility is to get home safe, not to jeopardise that just so some hot-head can beat his Strava segment performance. 

Generally speaking, and this is really general, there are two flavours of bike shop - the big brand, 'big box' shop like a supermarket and then the 'Local Bike Shop' (LBS), much more like the local corner shop where the shopkeeper is, allegedly, more interested in the customer. Gross oversimplification I know, but you get the idea. From the LBS I would be absolutely shocked if they allowed a customer to buy a bike without asking some questions about the prospective use. That said, even in a big box store, it's going to be unlikely that you could pick up a boxed new bike and just take it to the till without any involvement from the sales person. These days, the build quality on new bikes (especially on the known large brands), is close to perfect. Any defects you'll have will stem from local assembly - loose nuts, under-inflated tyres, etc. If the bike looks, even to the uninitiated, as if it will do the job, it probably will. 

It's not a study per se, but the Wattbike gym machine has a useful power output meter which shows the power being applied by each leg (explained in more detail on their website). The basic premise is that by smoothing out the push and the pull you can see a visible effect on the power curve on the display. The real key (from personal anecdotal experience) is that clipless pedals assist in these actions because the pull isn't just employing a different set of muscles in the leg and adding more power (although it is doing that), you're also reducing the total down time in each cycle. If you're just pushing, there's going to be periods where either neither is pushing and thus the bike/revolving weight is decelerating or even where both are pushing and counteracting each other. Clipless pedals aren't going to assist in the latter case, but they will in the former. So by pulling you're helping to compensate for the lag in the cycle until the other leg starts pushing and we all know that maintaining a speed is generally easier than accelerating to that speed. So if you've got even 5-10 degrees (or more) of arc in every cycle where neither foot is pushing (see the wattbike examples of a bad transition, the curve that looks like a figure-of-eight) then you're having to work to regain the previous power. While if you're managing the leg-to-leg transition, the effort doesn't drop off so much (resulting in a 'peanut' curve) and you're not losing as much power. Additionally, as suggested here, the clip is allowing you to attach at a better point on the base of foot, rather than on the ball of the foot which is demanded by your not being attached. 

In addition to the cool dark place, I would also suggest keeping them in their retail box/container to minimise the chance that something could brush against them and puncture them. (This is from experience - I left some on a shelf in a shed and some garden implement or other ripped a hole in the side!) N.B. this is the main reason for having the little cap on the valve - to avoid accidental self-puncturing. 

My favourite base layers are Merino wool, in particular from Rapha. They are seriously not cheap, but they are definitely worth it. Very warm in winter with the long sleeve, but surprisingly cooling in the summer with the short/no sleeve. 

I think you've answered your question - as tight as you can (I'd throw in by 'hand' because that would seem to feel right, once you use vices and so on, it's going above and beyond reasonable tightness). Bear in mind that you need a little slack because the teeth on the two cogs won't match exactly so you need to allow for some give to line them up independently, but enough to pinch a small amount seems fine. 

I'm not necessarily sure that the number of gears here is the key issue - it's going to be the upper and lower range: what are the extremes of your gear ratios (or gear inches, if you'd prefer)? Maybe your largest gear just isn't large enough. Maybe you need a bigger front cog (or a smaller rear one) to allow you to get up to the same ratio that he can use. 

If you're in the correct position, you can either fight, flight or embarrass. If you're in the wrong place, than just admit you're wrong, wave an apologetic hand and move on. Assuming you're in the right (and it sounds like you were), then first option is to fight. A scowling look, with a snarling "what?" and then pointing out the helmet cam on the lid generally works for me. (Whether the camera is on or off doesn't matter, most people don't like the thought that their fractious behaviour could come back to haunt them). Second choice is flight. Just cycle on out of there, don't stop, don't look back, just bravely run away. There's no shame in that. The car is bigger and heavier than you and will beat you in a fight. Running away from a bully doesn't help to change their behaviour, but you'll live to fight another day. They don't give out bravery medals to cyclists adopting the primary position. Finally, there's the more nuanced option to embarrass. It really helps here to start smooth and make direct contact. I'll sometimes hold their eye and start talking. They'll then be forced to open a window (if it's not open already), then I'll make a spurious guess at why they were beeping me "oh, sorry, did I drop something and you were letting me know?" - ultimately you're trying to get them to tell you that they think you shouldn't be there. At which point you can invoke the helmet cam, or just call them an narrow-minded, blinkered idiot and just carry on your day. Sometimes, instead I'd ask them if they'd have behaved like that if I'd been a cop, or their mother, or their child. Chances are very slim that they would. Just force them to think for a moment. 

I can't speak as a user of them, but I can as one who has followed them. They seem to work reasonably well, but they aren't as good at protecting people behind you - the arc behind them is narrower than the traditional curved in guard. I would think that in this regard, wider would seem to be better In this they are better than the horizontally flat guards you see, which do nothing to protect those following you. If you're only worried about your back and legs, these seem fine - but if you're concerned for your fellow travelers, I'd be less keen on them. 

Nothing - you're not missing anything; going out and riding 100 miles on your own is fine, but going out on an organised ride is a different experience. Maybe it's about the camaraderie, following someone else's route, not having to think about the route - just follow the signs or the provided GPX, the provided rest stops, mechanical support, accurate timing, supporting a charity, getting the t-shirt at the end or just swapping stories after the event. And sometimes it's about the peer pressure. If you're on your own and you wake up that morning and the weather's a little sub-optimal or you don't feel tip-top, you'll just turn over and go back to sleep. But you've paid 100 $CurrencyUnits, so you'll get up and do it. Or you're half way round and you feel like stopping or taking a short cut. Or suffering up that climb. Nothing like a cheery "come on, mate" from a colleague to get you sparking again and finishing something you might not have finished. 

The received wisdom has always been that, in an emergency stop, just pulling hard on the front brakes will massively increase the probability of a flip - especially if you're on a downward slope. The back brake is generally more for minor corrections, a bit of extra control on the speed, but implicitly not about outright stopping. In a peleton or paceline, where brake usage is generally frowned upon, if you do need to dab the brakes, then using the back ones will also send a message to the rider behind when they see it clinching - almost like a car's red brake light. Contrary to that, use of the front brakes is hidden to the rider behind - but they'll quickly notice that you've slowed down (and that is the way that reputations are forged). Personally, my commuting fixed doesn't even have a back brake, so I'm hovering around 100% usage of the front brake, that's if you don't count the drivetrain as a brake - and I know that almost all speed control is done without that front brake at all, the only time the brake is engaged is in the last few yards before junctions and lights when legs alone can't do the job quickly enough. It feels to me that usage of 95% seems high - but that could just be my style, maybe a little more defensive born of so many commuting miles! 

I'd maybe ask the cyclists themselves - maybe ask them to bring useful spares and have an amount of petty cash on hand to reimburse them. They might be able to bring in old lights (let's face it many of us always leap to the newest kit and have drawers full of old kit lying around). The basic tool set should include tyre levers, an adjustable spanner/wrench or combination bike tool, Allan keys (hex wrench). If you're prepared to keep things topped up with consumables as well, that would be great - but you'll be forever replacing the inner tubes, but while you might need a mix of sizes, starting just with a few 700x25c would work. I'm not convinced about spare helmets - apart from the whole obligated helmet wearing debate - you might be opening yourself up for liability if someone got badly injured in an accident while wearing one of the loaner items. Many lights these days are rechargeable themselves, either through USB or directly to mains, so making sure that there are charging sockets and a charged USB hub could be good, maybe a battery charger would encourage people to switch to that style of battery. 

You'll almost certainly be in bucket 1, although if you're asking the question, then assume the answer to bucket 3. 

The CO2 inflater is, for me, only an emergency option. It lives in my saddle bag to get me home after a flat. I haven't rigorously investigated it, but anecdotally I think that tyres inflated with CO2 deflate by themselves more quickly than air-inflated tyres do. Fortunately I haven't punctured too much recently, but the last couple of roadside fixes with CO2 inflation have deflated overnight which, when re-inflated with air, have been fine (i.e. no secondary punctures). 

The fixed gear mechanism is very simple - the cog is wound onto its thread so that when you pedal forward you are tightening the screw (as well as moving the bike forward). The opposite is also true, when you apply backward pressure, you're not just stopping, you're trying to loosen the screw. Most often you won't budge the cog, but it is possible that a lot of backward pressure (e.g. slowing down or tricks like track stands) and without a way to inhibit the cog loosening, the cog will loosen (and indeed come off). This is what I imagine is happening here. A loosening of the cog and lack of connection between your leg direction and the wheel's motion. You did nothing wrong by just flipping the wheel and using the other side. The key is the lockring - this attaches to the hub but on a contra-thread, so you tighten it when the drive cog is tight, but backward pressure doesn't loosen it. The issue is safety. I used to ride without a lockring, but after a few instances of the cog coming loose, I relented - it is certainly safer on the road and for the sake of a few dollars/points/local currency units, there's no real downside to a lockring (apart from being a little fiddly to remove, but you don't do that very often). 

There's no fundamental difference between using a CO2 and using an old/portable hand pump - you guess. The major difference, obviously, is that the CO2 cartridge inflates the tyre much, much quicker, so you can get from 0 to 80/100 in a fraction of a second rather than after many, many hand pumps. But the checking is the same - how hard is the tyre when pinched between your fingers and does it bounce 'properly' when dropped? Unless you were really unlucky, you still have another tyre to use as a control and to compare the relative pressures (you'll be running the two tyres at roughly the same pressures, I assume, and the tyres themselves will be similar, probably the same model of similar age and wear). The CO2 is only designed as a stopgap until you get to a proper shop with a track pump, so underinflate if you're concerned - enough to make sure that your rims will be protected!
