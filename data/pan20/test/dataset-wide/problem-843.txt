It would be more accurate to say that a black hole eventually turns whatever falls in it into equal quantities of matter and antimatter. The difference between matter and antimatter is defined by some conserved (or approximately conserved) quantum numbers. For example, matter baryons and quarks have positive baryon number, while antibaryons and antiquarks have negative baryon number. Leptons (e.g., electrons, neutrinos) and their antiparticles have a corresponding lepton number instead. Semiclassically, a black hole evaporates through Hawking radiation. For astrophysically large black holes, this will be overwhelmingly be in terms of photons, which are their own antiparticles, but once the black hole evaporates to a small enough size, it will also radiate massive particles as well. Because there are no long-range forces that couple to baryon number or lepton number, a black hole is under no obligation to conserve them, and thus should radiate equal amounts of matter and antimatter, regardless of what fell into it. This is unlike, say, energy-momentum, electric charge, and angular momentum, the presence of which makes a difference in the long-range gravitational and/or electromagnetic fields. Thus the total amount of charge the black hole will radiate should match the total amount that fell into it, etc. Unless, of course, quantum gravity gives us more surprises, which is definitely possible. 

Since I don't have Walter's book, I'm uncertain as the context of the derivation of the equation you quote. Therefore, I've simply re-derived it here; apologies if there's some repetition of things you already know, but perhaps it'll be useful for anyone else reading this regardless. Constants of Motion The Schwarzschild solution is the unique nontrivial spherically symmetric vacuum solution of general relativity. In the Schwarzschild coordinate chart and units of $G = c = 1$, the metric takes the form $$\mathrm{d}s^2 = -\left(1-\frac{2M}{r}\right)\mathrm{d}t^2 + \left(1-\frac{2M}{r}\right)\mathrm{d}r^2 + r^2\left(\mathrm{d}\theta^2 + \sin^2\theta\,\mathrm{d}\phi^2\right)\text{,}$$ and one can immediately note that that the metric coefficients are completely independent of $t$ and $\phi$, which implies that $\partial_t$ and $\partial_\phi$ are Killing vector fields. They are important here because along with generating symmetries of the geometry, they also produce conserved orbital quantities in the following way: given an orbit with four-velocity $u^\mu = (\dot{t},\dot{r},\dot{\theta},\dot{\phi})$, the inner product with a Killing vector field is conserved: $$\epsilon = -\langle\partial_t,u\rangle = \left(1-\frac{2M}{r}\right)\frac{\mathrm{d}t}{\mathrm{d}\tau}\text{,}$$ $$h = \langle\partial_\phi,u\rangle = r^2\sin^2\theta\,\frac{\mathrm{d}\phi}{\mathrm{d}\tau}\text{.}$$ The overdot indicates differentiation with respect to any affine parameter of the orbit, which for timelike geodesics appropriate for massive particles we can take without loss of generality to be the proper time $\tau$. An alternative way to find these constants of motion is to integrate the $t$ and $\phi$ components of the geodesic equation, but in this way they can read off immediately from the metric. These are the specific energy and specific angular momentum of the orbit, respectively. Also note that the coordinates are analogues of the spherical coordinates for Euclidean space, where $\theta$ is the zenith angle while $\phi$ is the azimuth; if we take the orbital plane to be the equatorial plane ($\theta = \pi/2$), then $\phi$ would represent the true anomaly. Effective Potential Substituting the above constants of motion into the timelike worldline condition $\langle u,u\rangle \equiv g_{\mu\nu} u^\mu u^\nu = -1$, i.e., $$-\left(1-\frac{2M}{r}\right)\dot{t}^2 + \left(1-\frac{2M}{r}\right)^{-1}\dot{r}^2 + r^2\dot{\phi}^2 = -1\text{,}$$ one can immediately derive the effective gravitational potential: $$\frac{1}{2}(\epsilon^2-1) = \frac{1}{2}\dot{r}^2 + \underbrace{\left[-\frac{M}{r}+\frac{h^2}{2r^2} - \frac{Mh^2}{r^3}\right]}_{V_\text{eff}}\text{,}$$ or if one insists on a formal comparison with the Newtonian effective potential ($L\equiv mh$), $$E = \underbrace{\frac{1}{2}m\dot{r}^2 + \frac{L^2}{2mr^2} - \frac{GMm}{r}}_{\text{Newtonian form}} - \frac{GML^2}{mr^3c^2}\text{.}$$ Orbit Equation Differentiation of the above effective potential gives $$\ddot{r} + \frac{M}{r^2} - \frac{h^2}{r^3} + 3\frac{Mh^2}{r^4} = 0\text{.}$$ In terms of $u \equiv 1/r$ with prime denoting differentiation with respect to $\phi$, $$u''= \frac{\mathrm{d}\tau}{\mathrm{d}\phi}\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}\tau}\left(\frac{\mathrm{d}\tau}{\mathrm{d}\phi}\dot{u}\right) = \frac{r^2}{h}\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}\tau}\left(\frac{r^2}{h}\left(-r^{-2}\dot{r}\right)\right) = -\frac{\ddot{r}r^2}{h^2}\text{,}$$ this gives, after multiplication through by $-r^2/h^2$, $$u'' + u = \frac{M}{h^2} + 3Mu^2\text{.}$$ However, there is really no need to consider a second-order at any point; there's a simpler one in terms of $V \equiv V_\text{eff} - h^2/2r^2$, the effective potential sans the centrifugal potential term: $$\begin{eqnarray*} \frac{2}{h^2}\left[\frac{E}{m}-V\right] &=& \frac{\dot{r}^2}{h^2} + \frac{1}{r^2} \\&=& \frac{1}{r^4}\left[\frac{\mathrm{d}r}{\mathrm{d}\phi}\right]^2 + u^2 \\&=& (u')^2 + u^2\text{.} \end{eqnarray*}$$ 

To have physical content, we need to not only interpret spacetime as a four-dimensional manifold, but also say something about what the curvature is in terms of physical quantities. Given the stress-energy-momentum tensor $T_{\mu\nu}$ and its trace $T$, the Einstein field equation provides the Ricci curvature: $$R_{\mu\nu} = \kappa\left(T_{\mu\nu} - \frac{1}{2}g_{\mu\nu}T\right)\tag{EFE}\text{,}$$ where $\kappa = 8\pi G/c^4$ is a constant. So does that mean that matter attracts or not? Well, it still depends: locally, we can say that under gravitational freefall, a small ball of initially comoving test particles with initial four-velocity $u$ will contract whenever $R_{\mu\nu}u^\mu u^\nu\geq 0$. Substituting in the above Einstein field equation, we get the strong energy condition, which basically boils down to 'gravity is always locally attractive'. However, even though the strong energy condition might not necessary hold (and gravity can be repulsive, e.g. on the cosmological scale due to dark energy), it holds under ordinary circumstances. That's because in the local inertial frame comoving with $u$, the trace of the stress-energy tensor is $T = -\rho + 3p$, where $p$ is the pressure (pretending for simplicity that we're dealing with a perfect fluid; otherwise, we can take average of the principal stresses), while $\rho = T_{\mu\nu}u^\mu u^\nu$ is the energy density. Therefore, the time-time projection of the Einstein field equation is (in units of $G=c=1$): $$\mathbb{E}^\alpha{}_\alpha \equiv R_{\mu\nu} u^\mu u^\nu = 4\pi(\rho+3p)\text{.}$$ Since energy density and pressure have equivalent units, to compare, ordinary water has a density of $(1\;\mathrm{kg}/\mathrm{L})c^2 = 9.0\times 10^{19}\,\mathrm{Pa} = 8.9\times 10^{14}\,\mathrm{atm}$. Ordinary matter has overwhelmingly higher energy density than stress. The above time-time projection of the Einstein field equation is the direct analogue of the Gauss' law for Newtonian gravity (matter density) or electromagnetism (charge density). In the weak-field limit (small deviation from flatness), we can use this to recover Poisson's equation for Newtonian gravity; see also part of this answer. In other words, the Einstein field equations guarantees that not only is ordinary matter locally attractive, but that in the weak-field limit, it is essentially Newtonian as well. 

The energy as measured by whom? Imagine a family of stationary observers everywhere surrounding the black hole, or at least along an infalling particle's trajectory. Those observers measure the speed and energy of the particle as it falls past them. As the particle nears the horizon, they will report speeds arbitrarily close to the speed of light and arbitrarily high energies. But to a far-away stationary observer, those observers near the horizon are experiencing increasingly divergent gravitational time dilation, and the orbital energy of the particle stays constant. Flinging a particle of mass $m$ into the black hole will increase the mass of the black hole by $m\epsilon$. 

The comoving radial distance, which is also the proper distance at current epoch, at redshift $z$ is given by $$D_\mathrm{C} = \frac{c}{H_0}\int_0^z\frac{\mathrm{d}x}{\sqrt{\Omega_\mathrm{M}(1+x)^3 + \Omega_k(1+x)^2+\Omega_\Lambda}}\text{.}$$ For a spatially flat cosmology, $\Omega_k = 0$, and so matter and dark energy density parameters are related through $\Omega_\mathrm{M} = 1-\Omega_\Lambda$. From WMAP, $\Omega_\Lambda = 0.721\pm 0.025$ (and various refinements for measurements of dark energy density), from which it follows that every object comoving with the Hubble flow at redshift $z\gtrsim 1.4$ has superluminal recession velocity from us. This corresponds to a light travel time of $c^{-1}D_\mathrm{ltt}\gtrsim 9.1\,\mathrm{Gyr}$. The most distant objects found by the Hubble telescope have $z\approx 12$, corresponding to a light travel time of approximately $13.4\,\mathrm{Gyr}$. Therefore, we do routinely see objects that have superluminal recession velocity from us. I found the light travel times with the help of this cosmology calculator. 

Formally, an event horizon is the boundary of a region of spacetime that's not in the causal past of future null infinity. In other words, the boundary of a region from which even idealized light rays cannot escape to infinity. Whenever the event horizon is smooth, it is also null hypersurface--i.e., the direction perpendicular to it is a light ray. Because the event horizon is defined in terms of the infinite future, the definition is very non-local, and one would need to know the entire future history to be sure where the event horizon is. As such, it is only one of a half-dozen different types of horizons used to study black holes. Though the event-horizon itself is a three-dimensional hypersurface in spacetime, it can also be viewed as an evolving two-dimensional membrane made of a viscuous electrically conducting fluid with finite temperature and entropy but zero thermal conductivity. 

Let's say you have a rocket near a Schwarzschild black hole. Near the horizon, the thrust required to keep stationary goes to infinity; in this specific sense, the gravitational force becomes infinite at the horizon. If the rocket is hovering above the horizon, then the difference in gravitational forces becomes arbitrarily large near the horizon. This can tear it apart. However, an object falling into the black hole will also gain a velocity arbitrarily close to the speed of light (as measured by a stationary observer as it passes) as it gets closer to the horizon, meaning it will be length-contracted. It shrinks to zero size. As a result, the difference in 'gravitational force' across it is more complicated, and in fact remains finite. 

Actually, the point of that calculation was to show that it's at least prima facie plausible. The Schwarzschild radius calculation doesn't rule out the black hole--quite the opposite. However, it's also not appropriate for reasons I explained above. The more relevant one actually does have mass more than one order of magnitude apart, and shows inconsistency. So if GTR with Λ is correct, it's unlikely because the ΛCDM error bars aren't that bad. However, even if we still treat it as "close enough", that does not by itself imply what you want. The question of what kind of black hole all the mass of the observable universe would make, if any, is quite different from whether or not we're living in one. The black hypothetical needs to be larger still. The biggest point of uncertainly, though, is the cosmological constant, even if GTR is otherwise correct. If we're allowed to have very different conditions outside our hypothetical black hole, then we could still have one, but then we get into very speculative physics at best, and just complete guesswork at worst. So treat the above answer as conditional on the mainstream physics; if that's not what you want, then there can be no general answer besides "we don't know". And that's always a possibility, although not a very interesting one. 

It does work, in the sense of being consistent with observations. In fact, in the standard ΛCDM cosmological model, space is infinite and Euclidean. 

A spherical cap has surface area of $A = 2\pi Rh$, and here $R = 21\,\mathrm{kly}$. Now, I'm unclear what cross-sectional radius means if measured as an angle, but I take it to mean that the opening half-angle of the cone is $\frac{\vartheta}{2} = 5^\circ$, in which case $$A = 2\pi R^2\left(1-\cos\frac{\vartheta}{2}\right) \sim 10^{39}\,\mathrm{m}^2\text{.}$$ Thus, the power would be $P\sim 10^{12}\,\mathrm{W}$, but note that in addition to the assumptions you've just listed, we're only talking about a particular radio band. 

You seem to be using that word in an idiosyncratic sense I'm not familiar with. In any case, you're mistaken about what "the universe is infinite" implies. 

That is not entirely incorrect. The Schwarzschild spacetime of an uncharged, nonrotating black hole in the Gullstrand-Painlevé coordinates is $$\mathrm{d}s^2 = -\mathrm{d}t^2 + \underbrace{\left(\mathrm{d}r + \sqrt{\frac{2M}{r}}\,\mathrm{d}t\right)^2}_\text{suckhole} + r^2(\mathrm{d}\theta^2+\sin^2\theta\,\mathrm{d}\phi^2)\text{.}$$ Where it deviates from ordinary, flat Minkowski spacetime is entirely in the middle square term. Here, the time coordinate $t$ is not the Schwarzschild time, but rather the time measured by an observer free-falling from rest at infinity. The last bit, if adjoined with the $\mathrm{d}r^2$ term one would get by multiplying out the middle part, is ordinary Euclidean $3$-space written in spherical coordinates. If you recognize from Newtonian gravity the quantity $\sqrt{2M/r}$, or $\sqrt{2GM/r}$ in ordinary units, as the escape velocity, then the picture is very peculiar indeed: according to an observer free-falling from rest at infinity, Euclidean space is sucked into the singularity at the local escape velocity. The event horizon is the surface at which the speed at which space is "falling" at the speed of light. This is an additional reason why sonic black holes are good analogues to their gravitational counterparts. In a sonic black hole, there can be an actual "suckhole" that drains a low-viscosity fluid at an increasing velocity, up to and faster than the speed of sound in that fluid. This forms an acoustic event horizon that is one-way to sound and is expected to have an analogue of Hawking radiation. The corresponding structure for charged black holes is similar, and for a rotating one more complicated, although can still be described as "sucking" with a certain additional twist that rotates the free-falling observers. 

At whichever point you decide to call them two objects rather than one object. It's a completely arbitrary choice that depends on you rather than gravitational physics. What's going on is that gravity can be described by a mass density distribution, and which part of that distribution corresponds to "one object" and which to "another object" isn't important. You may be confused by Newton's law of gravity that says the gravitational force force is proportional to the product of the masses and inversely proportional to the distance between them squared. But this law only applies to spherically symmetric objects. It only applies to you exactly if you're a spherical cow. This kind of arbitrariness actually applies to the Earth as well. Even if the Earth were perfectly spherically symmetric, one could say that Earth's gravity is due to the influence of the northern hemisphere and the influence of the southern hemisphere, etc. Whether you consider the Earth to be one object, or two, or a trillion, depends on you. The Earth isn't spherically symmetric. It's closer to an oblate spheroid, since it bulges at the equator. But it isn't exactly that either, having mountains or other topographical feature, to say nothing of mass density variations inside the Earth. In principle, one could describe its gravity including people and trees or whatnot. Gravitationally, there is no fundamental difference between you and some rock. That you consider yourself to not be "part of Earth" is a choice you make for other reasons. If you distance yourself from the Earth, there is a difference because the mass distribution would change. But again, whether you consider this to be "only one gravitational influence" or "the Earth plus you" is up to you, and this holds true regardless of whether you distanced yourself or not. 

If you're referring to one of Anderson et al.'s analyses, the value is $43.13\pm0.14$. Under GTR, this value is compatible with any $J_2$ up to about $$\begin{eqnarray*}\frac{J_2R^2c^2}{2GMp}\lesssim 0.0067 &\Longleftrightarrow & J_2\lesssim 2.3\times10^{-6}\text{.}\end{eqnarray*}$$ But what is the Sun's quadrupole moment? This is a somewhat sticky question, but the results of lunar laser ranging experiments are incompatible with $J_2$ of more than about $3\times10^{-6}$, while using helioseismology, Pijpers (1998) estimates $J_2 = (2.18\pm0.06)\times 10^{-7}$. Using Pijper's value yields a GTR prediction of $43.01''$ per century, which is compatible with Anderson et al.'s analysis. 

Without some reference to compare to, time passing more slowly makes no sense at all. But every clock has its own proper time that measures time along its own worldline. In cosmological models, the cosmological time is the proper time of a certain kind of ideal observer: one comoving with the Hubble flow. In other words, imagine space filled with observers for whom the universe looks as close to the same in every direction as possible (zero CMBR dipole anisotropy). The cosmological time is what's measured by their clocks. As such, there is no time dilation... because we defined our time coordinate as that which is measured by the comoving clocks no matter how small or dense the universe is. You can see this in the standard form of the FLRW metric: $$\mathrm{d}s^2 = -\mathrm{d}t^2 + a^2(t)\left[\frac{\mathrm{d}r^2}{1-kr^2} + r^2\,\mathrm{d}\Omega^2\right]\text{,}$$ where nothing happens to the time component no matter what the scale factor $a(t)$ is. How could we compare the rate of clocks now with rate of clocks then? We could have the past clock emit some pattern, say a light at a specific frequency, and then later catch and measure it. If we find a different frequency, we could interpret this as evidence of time dilation. But we could also fix the clocks as our time standard and interpret the frequency shift as the result of a changing scale factor. We could also arbitrarily rescale the time coordinate any way we like, but there's no point in doing so because it wouldn't change the time experienced by comoving clocks.
