This isn't as good an answer because now we're going to talk about what's not good in your current role, and if I don't believe you that those things can't be changed, I might start to think you're someone who changes jobs at the drop of a hat, but it's not a kiss of death. For example maybe your old job has a long commute and you don't want to move because you live near family, love your neighbourhood or whatever and my job offers a much shorter commute. That answer has actually reassured me that you're likely to stick with me if I hire you. Compare that to "my boss is a jerk" or "I'm not getting promoted fast enough" or "the stock options are insufficiently generous". And finally, if the reason for you knowing the job exists is a flattering one, then this is a giant softball question that you can use to make yourself look fantastic: 

When you say "the policy is we shouldn't" you think you're saying "so stop bugging me to do it" but they hear an invitation to rebut: "the policy is dumb then, can't you get it changed?" I recommend an answer that contains more of the truth, such as these: 

It is true that the people who are paying for the software to be developed can change what they want to have developed at any time. However, it is not true that they can do so without consequences. So next time you're asked for (for example) a screen that shows these 4 columns, in this order, and then when it's almost done they say actually two of those columns we don't need, but we need these 3 extra ones, and there needs to be totals, plus the user should be able to sort by any column just by clicking on the heading, and also we should remember what sort order they used last time, you don't say: 

I have had staff decline a business trip for personal or family reasons. When it's one trip, I get it. Your mother's birthday, or your sister's anniversary, or being the one to put your baby to bed every night, is more important than this trip. Let's talk about how to get you the information, or how to get your ideas shared, or whatever else we were going to gain from the trip, without you having to go. Or, let's find some out-of-the-box ways to make it work. I had an employee with a little baby who turned a conference trip into a family trip - in the daytime the other parent (who was on parental leave) hung out in the luxury hotel with the baby and did some sightseeing while my employee was at the conference with me. Evenings they spent as a family and the baby was put to bed just as at home, with both parents. Another handled the clash between a conference and a family vacation plan by having the vacation in the conference city (which happened to be Orlando) and again spending the days at the conference and the evenings with family. The weekend before and after the conference were 24 hour family time, and we covered the hotel and the cost of one flight. However, if you are going to decline every trip of any length forever, this may limit you. I had a staff member who needed more skills - we are a consulting company and old skills lose value and everyone must gain new ones. I had a specific skill in mind that the company needed. No training for it was available online or in our town. The employee said that a week out of town for training was never going to be ok for family reasons. Fine, but that means the employee will never gain that skill. There aren't that many other staff. How can I be sure the company has all the skills we need? It may be that this person just can't work here, nice as they are, smart as they are, if they can't do the training to gain the skills that I can sell. This example is less relevant now with the rise of online training, but imagine a travel agent who can never go to the places the firm sells ... personal experience is highly relevant in that industry. Or someone at a strategy-setting level in a firm who can never go to meetings with international partners. You may limit yourself if you decline all trips forever. Does that mean declining this trip today will torpedo your career? Of course not. But for your own sake, try to work out something that will get you some of the benefit of attending, and show that you care about it. That might mean calling in, it might mean talking to someone who is attending both before (to provide your opinions) and after (to learn what happened) the trip. Not caring about important business events is a far bigger negative than whether or not you're able to attend them. And a tip (though I understand you may not talk to your boss in English) please decline the generous offer of a lovely trip and a chance to learn strategic information about company plans rather than refuse to go to something your boss wants you to go to. Trust me, it helps. "Thanks for the opportunity, but I can't take advantage of it this time" will always be better than "I'm not doing that and you can't force me to". 

Just go with one or two fairly neutral sentences about knowing it's a nice place to live - not so much that it outshines the job, but enough that they're not worried you'll get homesick and leave. Things may be different between your two countries, but where I live I would worry more that a new hire would go home than that they would sue me. IF they honestly believe all foreigners are just angling for a lawsuit, I doubt any answer you can come up with will change their minds about you. So simple, short, honest, move on to the next question. 

I would try taking all of this at face value. That 5 minute thing is someone's "favorite commit"? Big smile, thanks for telling me, we're here to help right? Possibly "bet you wish you'd gotten around to it, eh!" Something is "too hard"? Sympathetic face, "would you like me to get it reassigned to me? I think I can handle it next week." Encourage him to be clear and open about what he cannot or will not do, so at least you know about it, and everyone else does too, because the work items get reassigned in the tracking system, for example. If he is keeping you from doing a great job, because things take too long or you otherwise look bad, that's something to deal with. But if he is unfireable, and knows it, and enjoys his privilege, well what can you do? The world is full of people with privilege and they're generally pretty happy people. Getting unhappy yourself won't do anything to them. If you like your job, you're good at it, and nothing is happening to you when he messes up - in other words the company is wasting a salary it could be paying you with, but nothing else - then hey, life is like that sometimes and it could be worse. 

Once it's fixed, have a lessons-learned conversation and focus on the actions to be taken to prevent a recurrence. This may involve digging a lot deeper than "X clicked the wrong button" to things like "Why was X the only one there to click any buttons?" "Why did X not know the consequences of clicking that?" "Why did nobody else take steps to prevent this before?" When your bosses focus on penalizing, it can be very difficult to point them towards a different path. Detailed investigations that reveal it was actually those same bosses who didn't approve the overtime, or the training expense, or the headcount increase, or the upgrade to the latest version, and caused this problem could cure them of that tendency. After all, if someone with 3 months experience is the only one around when things go bad, and makes the wrong call, is blaming that inexperienced person and punishing them actually going to fix anything? I would suggest you work hard on two separate goals: 

I could therefore use your background information to conclude "he's probably making it up again" or "poor thing, he really doesn't see these guys coming, someone should take him under a wing." I would suggest you move extremely cautiously with HR. Especially if you're sure this is a baseless claim, you wouldn't want to offer information that actually supports it. So answer what you were asked, truthfully and completely. Then, in a separate email with a different subject line (eg More info re Manager X) write something like: 

It should not be on you to point out that being flirted with when you just came here to work is not cool. It should not be on you to set up and enforce the line between "nice" and "trying to date me". It should not be on you to educate your harasser, your boss, and all your colleagues about how this makes actual human people feel. Nor to remind them that women are actual human people. Yet here you are. If you don't feel like taking all this on, you don't have to - but you probably won't be able to work there harassment-free unless you do, and you may not be able to work there harassment-free under any circumstances. Take as much control as you can. 

I think this is highly industry-specific. In the restaurant business, there's a saying: If you've got time to lean, you've got time to clean. Essentially everybody, whether front or back of house, is expected to clean in their downtime. But I think if you saw a lawyer or accountant tidying the mailroom and doing the recycling, you'd think "haven't you got someting better to do?" A tech support role is between the two. I'd expect you to clean up your own messes, and perhaps to do a quick 5 minute cleanup in the kitchen or mailroom while standing around waiting for coffee to brew or a photocopying job to finish, in other words when you're in that room anyway. For longer gaps, the ideal task 

And so on. My mum is learning about the sport in question, and A is doing most of the talking. You could use this technique to join lunch conversations. Then when you've learned enough about whatever they're discussing to see an application of your work, you could ask some more questions: 

(They usually say no. If they accept, you can educate them during that hour or two, not now in front of everyone.) And finally, for the "I'm so much smarter than you" guy who isn't, and who you've butted heads with before:
