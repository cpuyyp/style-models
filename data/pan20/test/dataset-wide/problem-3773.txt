In the modern view, is Zagier's argument rigorous? Is it fair say the equidistribution of the horocycle flow implies the prime number theorem? Certainly he writes one proof on the page, but I think I am seeing two. I found this blog where Zagier's work is also mentioned with work of Sarnak, Ratner, and Str√∂mbergsson numerous others. I found Zagier's papers informative but dense and I am not always 100% sure I am reading them correctly. It may be possible that in the process of using short-hand the theorems are false as I have written them! 

The sequence of fractional parts $\{ nx \}$ with $n \in \mathbb{Z}$ is dense in the reals. First we can divide $[0,1]$ into intervals $[0,1/n]\cup [1/n,2/n]\cup \dots \cup [1-1/n,1]$. Two numbers are in the same interval $n\alpha, n\beta \in [k/n, k/n+1/n]$ for some $0 < a < b < n+2$ and we get $n(b-a) \in [0,1/n]$. We get evenly spaced values of $\{ n x\}$ for arbitrarily small spacing. This is more or less Kronecker Approximation Theorem with a hint of why Weyl Equidistribution might be true. 

Zagier observes that $R^\ast(n)$ is multiplicative so that enough we solve for the primes $$ R^\ast(p^r) = \# \big\{ b \pmod{p^r} \big| b^2 \equiv D \pmod{p^r} \big\} $$ Then we can reconstruct $R(n)$ from the count of "primitive" representations of $n$, $R^\ast(n)$ 

What is counter-intuitive, is that both theories focus on the edges rather than the squares and don't really care about dominoes, but instead about counting perfect matchings. Here is a shape of a deficient rectangle. And I split into 4 rectangles and for each region I can count the tilings. We are not done because it's possible to have dominoes cross the border slightly. CR Cimasoni-Reshetikhin says (among many other things), that you define a matrix indexed by the edges that cross the boundary, and you "resolve" each one. Either there's domino there or not... So in this way, if you "glue" the two rectangles together, you have to glue $2^n$ nearby shapes, where $n$ counts the number of border edges. They obtain some formula which is phrased in terms of the Arf invariant of the Spin structure. $$ Z(\Gamma) = \frac{1}{2^g} \sum_{[\xi] \in \mathcal{S}(\Sigma) } \text{Arf}(\xi) \; \text{Pf} (A^\Gamma)$$ where $[\xi]$ is a spin structure on the surface $\Sigma$ and $A^\Gamma$ is the Kasteleyn matrix. In a way, the Kasteleyn orientation is like a discrete spin structure. GK Gaiotto-Kapustin define a topological invariant, so possibly we have ruled out the dimer model. Nor does [CR] claim to have a topological invariant. In any case, we can triangulate a manifold $X$ (in our case, the rectangle $$ X = \Big( [0,10]\times [0,10] \Big) \backslash \Big( [4,8] \times [5,8] \Big) $$ So we should define a triangulation on the dual graph. 

What do these branching rules mean? \begin{eqnarray*} SO(6)_E &\to& SU(2)_\ell \times SU(2)_r \times U(1)_\Sigma \end{eqnarray*} I am taking these examples from a paper of Gukov (on p.51) but more examples all over this paper. And this discussion of Lie groups and this notation could be in any number of papers. This could be the branching rules of a group representation, however this is likely the transformations of a sections of a vector bundle over a 6-dimensional space. 

He stopped revising is page in 2007. As for research level math there was a series called Games of No Chance as published by MSRI 

My main question is how the associativity of $G$ is getting twisted by the 3-cocycle ? All my other questions on the page are subordinate to this one. 

The proof talks about the Fubini study metric and it's just three steps: $$ \mathbb{E}[n_f] = \frac{1}{2\pi} \mathbb{E} \big[ \Delta \log |\,f\,| \big] = \frac{1}{2\pi} \log ||\,f\,||$$ The last step is an abbreviation for $\mathbb{E}\log |\vec{a}| = \log ||\vec{a}|| $ Why is this equivalent to the Crofton formula which expresses arc-length in terms of the intersection of a curve with random lines? $$ \int_{\mathrm{Gr}_1(\mathbb{R}^2)} \# \{ \ell \cap C\} d\mu = 2\pi | C|$$ 

The only example of a Nilmanifold I'll mention is the Heisenberg nilmanifold. $$ \left( \begin{array}{ccc} 1 & \mathbb{R} & \mathbb{R} \\\\ 0 & 1 & \mathbb{R}\\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{array} \right) \mod \left( \begin{array}{ccc} 1 & \mathbb{Z} & \mathbb{Z} \\\\ 0 & 1 & \mathbb{Z}\\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{array} \right) $$ This quotient space is the unit cube, but the quotient map is funny. I think it's $(x,y,z) \equiv ( \{ x\}, \{y\}, z - \lfloor z - x\lfloor y \rfloor \rfloor )$. It's not even clear to me the third coordinate lies in [0,1]. This can be extended to n by n matrices. Are all Nilmanifolds quotients of the Heisenberg group in this way? . 

There are a number of definitions of entropy floating around that are analogous even if they aren't equivalent. For any outsider they should look and feel nearly the same, for an expert you may be incline to choose one over the other. 

Are these necessarily Fuchsian groups? I would like to know what it means for such a group to have a Hausdorff dimension and whether any examples which have known $\delta$ (larger or smaller than $ \frac{1}{2}$). Guessing here we identify these $2 \times 2$ matrices as fractional linear transformations in $PSL(2, \mathbb{Z})$ acting on $\mathbb{H}$. With some searching I found that $SL(2, \mathbb{Z})$ is a Fuchsian group itself with a limit set of $\mathbb{R}$. This seems to be related to the fact that all real numbers have continued fraction expansions. Apparently there are subgroups $\Lambda \subset SL(2, \mathbb{Z}) $ where the limit set is smaller than $\mathbb{R}$ - in fact a Cantor set. What are some known examples where this is the case? 

The answer to my question is "yes". Technically, it's a spin-TQFT but now I am trying to make sense of that answer. 

These multigrids can be used to construct Penrose tilings. Here we are overlaying five sets of parallel lines. And I will stop here because you can read the article, using the grids alone try to fill out the tiling. $URL$ 

For any group character $\chi: G \to \mathbb{C}$, the function $\chi(g^k)$ is an integer-linear combination of other group characters in $\mathrm{Irr}(G)$. There doesn't seem to be a general way of finding the expansion in terms of the basic representations. In the case of the symmetric group $S_n$, the permutation representation (dim = n ) decomposes into the standard representation (dim = n-1) and the trivial representation (dim = 1). $\mathrm{perm} = (n) + (n-1,1)$. I like this representation b/c it's character is the number of fixed points. I would like to decompose $\chi_{\mathrm{perm}}(g^k)$ into an integer combination of irreducible characters. Fulton-Harris gives a formula for the exterior powers of the standard representation: $\wedge^d (n-1,1)= (n-d,d)$. I would settle for expanding $\chi_{(n-1,1)}(g^k)$ into irreducible characters. In terms of eigenvalues these are the elementary symmetric polynomials $e_1 = \lambda_1 + \dots \lambda_n$ and $e_2 = \sum_{i < j} \lambda_i \lambda_j$ and I'm looking for the symmetric powers $\lambda_1^k + \dots + \lambda_n^k$. Maybe there's a way using Newton's identities, but that doesn't explain how to expand the tensor product into irreducibles. Probably, $\chi_{\wedge^k \mathrm{perm}}(g)$ counts fixed k-element subsets of {1,2,...,n}, which is different than $\chi_{\mathrm{perm}}(g^k)$ counting (possibly degenerate) fixed $k$-cycles. 

If $h(z)$ is analytic on the disk centered at 0 of radius r, by the Cauchy Residue formula \[ \int \int_D h(z)\, dx dy = \pi r^2 h(0) \] The disk is the simplest example of a quadrature domain since the integral of a holomorphic function over the domain is determined by the value at a single point. How about the next simplest cases? What are connected quadrature domains whose integrals only depend on a few points (e.g. 2 or 3)? \[ \int \int_D h(z)\, dx dy = c_1 h(z_1) + c_2 h(z_2) + c_3 h(z_3) \] Probably these will all be close to the union of a few circles (with jumps in the coefficients as the radius changes). alt text $URL$ It looks exact quadrature domains can be constructed using meromorphic functions on Riemann surfaces and is related to uniformation of surfaces. There are relations to Laplacian growth, Random Matrix Theory & Integrable Hierarchies. 

If $a = -1$ you get $\displaystyle \left(1 + \frac{1}{r}\right)\cdot 0 \cdot \prod_{i=k}^n (1 + r^k)= 0$. The last factor is a generating function (free book inside!) counting the number of partitions of $k$ into distinct parts with parts at length at most $n$. Let's look at the partitions of $5$. \[ (5) \quad (4+1)\quad (3+2)\quad (3+1+1)\quad (2+2+1)\quad (2+1+1+1)\quad (1+1+1+1+1)\] This would appear as the $r^5$ term in that series. However, many of these do not have distinct parts. So we rule out the last four. \[ (5) \quad (4+1)\quad (3+2)\] However, with your two additional factors, you're allowing upto one $0$ and one $-1$ in your partition. \[ (5) \quad (4+1)\quad (3+2)\quad(6+(-1))\quad (5+0) \quad (4+1+0)\quad (3+2+0)\quad(6+0+(-1))\dots\] 

How about patterns which are not necessarily increasing like 121 (i.e. 121,232,343,454,3**4*3, etc.)? e.g. 51234321343221343234 has 343,121, 232,343,343 with 52124 left over. 

So the answer is likely no. There certainly won't be any repeating pattern such as: $$ 1+\sqrt{2} = 2 + \cfrac{1}{2 + \cfrac{1}{2 + \cfrac{1}{2 + \dots }}}$$ But I was hoping maybe for a pattern like we might find for the number $e = 2.718\dots$: $$ e = [2; 1, \color{blue}{2}, 1, 1, \color{blue}{4}, 1, 1, \color{blue}{6}, 1, 1, \color{blue}{8}, 1, 1, \color{blue}{10}, 1, 1, \color{blue}{12}, 1, 1, \color{blue}{14}, 1, 1, \color{blue}{16}, 1, 1, 1, ...]$$ So in fact $e = 1 + \frac{1}{1!} + \frac{1}{2!} + \frac{1}{3!} + \dots$ has a nicer continued fraction pattern than $\sqrt[3]{2}$. You can actually derive the continued fraction of $e$ (Henry Cohn) - but I haven't worked through it yet. 

In two dimensions, the Green's function of the Laplacian is the natural logarithm, $\nabla^2 \ln|z| = \delta(z)$, so we can take log of a polynomial the sum of delta-functions. \[ \nabla^2 \ln p(z) = \sum \delta(z - z_i) \] where $z_i$ runs over the roots of $p(z)=0$. The equation $\nabla^2 \phi = \rho$ is Poisson's equation. In our case, the charge distribution is the sum of point charges. I wonder if anyone has studied roots of polynomial equations by analogy to Electrostatics. 

It's good to read a clearly-stated geometric version of max-flow min-cut. I remember reading that in the thesis of John Sullivan, A Crystalline Approximation Theorem for Hypersurfaces. A linear optimization textbook usually only states the case for graphs. Since I am here, read the thesis, perhaps I should get on a soapbox and discuss it some when I can. 

One you partition your graph $\{ 1, 2, \dots, n\} = P_n \cup C_n$, you have defined a bipartite graph. Can you modify Erdos-Renyi to get bipartite graphs? For each $p \in P$ we can create an edge $(p,c)$ with probability $\mathbb{P} = \frac{1}{p}$ independently at random. For an Erdos-Renyi $\mathbb{P} = \frac{\log n}{n}$, I don't know what the threshhold for connectivity is for the graph outlined. Maybe you can show there are $\log x $ primes in $[x,2x]$ by constructing a graph between $P(x) = \{ primes \} \cap [1, x]$ and $C(x) = [x,2x]$. For large enough $x$ we would like to say that divisibility by these primes are "independent". Then your graph becomes the Erdos-Renyi independent-edges model you are talking about. However the edges connected to each $p \in P(x)$ appear with probability $\frac{1}{p}$. By unique factorization, every vertex in $C(x)$ is connected to something in $P(x)$. And you can calculate the threshhold probability for such an even to happen in the Erdos-Renyi case. Then you can ask why the primes hit this thresshold exactly? 

Perhaps you could prove such a result with Eisenstein series: $$ G_k(z) = - \frac{B_k}{k} + \sum_{n=1}^\infty \sigma_{k-1}(n)q^n = \frac{(2\pi i)^k}{(k-1)!} \times \frac{1}{2}\sum \frac{1}{(m \tau + n)^k}$$ However $G_0$ is not a meaningful Eisenstein series.
