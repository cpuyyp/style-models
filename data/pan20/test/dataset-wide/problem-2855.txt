For example, in real life if we want to prove someone is innocent we simply find a group of trusted witnesses to testify someone is innocent. In other words, to prove q in real life, we can easily find a p which results in q and it is not very challenging. What makes this challenging in mathematics though? Is it because we are not acquainted with mathematics world, the way we are with real world and once we become well familiar we can easily establish truth in mathematics world too? Update: Based on the provided suggestions I would like to narrow down the question a bit further. If we think of a proof as a chain of logical arguments, which starts from the set of axioms (assumptions) and reaches some conclusions (theorems), then how would mathematician try to establish this logical link between axioms and theorems (questions 1 and 2 above relate to this argument). Furthermore, it seems establishing this link between assumptions to the theorems is much easier in real life, regardless of the actual truth of the assumptions (question 3 above relates to this argument) Please see @MarkOxford's answer and comments there for further clarification. 

There are innumerable ways to express conditionals, so even if there are standard ways to translate some syntactic structures into logical notation (e.g., "If A, then B" = "A only if B" = A → B), you can only get so far with these. Also, not every sentence that seems to be a conditional is actually a conditional. Consider the difference between "Men are grumpy when they're hungry" and "Men are bachelors when they're unmarried" which have the same syntax but different logical form. So you need 2 things. First, a way to tell if a sentence is really conditional, and second, a way to tell which of the conditions in a conditional sentence is sufficient and which is necessary. The easiest way to do this is to draw a truth table for your sentence. Basically, you have to ask if the sentence you're considering is true or false for every possible distribution of truth values for it's clauses. For this sentence: Raimundo appears in every photograph that Yakira does not appear in. You have to consider what happens if: R appears and Y does not = T (Both clauses obtain) R appears and Y appears = T (1st clause obtains but second does not) R does not appear and neither does = F (2nd clause obtains and 1st one does not) R does not appear and Y does = T (Both clauses are false) When only one of these possibilities makes your sentence false, and it is one in which one of the clauses is false and the other is true, you know that you're dealing with a conditional sentence. The false clause in that possible world is your necessary condition, the true one is a sufficient condition. 

Sure. None have been successful though. 1 He who wants to attack a praxeological theorem has to trace it back, step by step, until he reaches a point in which, in the chain of reasoning that resulted in the theorem concerned, a logical error can be unmasked. But if this regressive process of deduction ends at the category of action without having discovered a vicious link in the chain of reasoning, the theorem is fully confirmed. Those positivists who reject such a theorem without having subjected it to this examination are no less foolish than those seventeenth-century astronomers were who refused to look through the telescope that would have shown them that Galileo was right and they were wrong. — Ludwig von Mises, Ultimate Foundation of Economic Science, p.70 2 "The essence of logical positivism is to deny the cognitive value of a priori knowledge by pointing out that all a priori propositions are merely analytic. They do not provide new information, but are merely verbal or tautological, asserting what has already been implied in the definitions and premises. Only experience can lead to synthetic propositions. There is an obvious objection against this doctrine, viz., that this proposition that there are no synthetic a priori propositions is in itself —as the present writer thinks, false— a synthetic a priori proposition, for it can manifestly not be established by experience." — Ludwig von Mises, The Ultimate Foundation of Economic Science, pg. 5 3 “The attempt to disprove the action-axiom would itself be an action aimed at a goal, requiring means, excluding other courses of action, incurring costs, subjecting the actor to the possibility of achieving or not achieving the desired goal and so leading to a profit or a loss. And the very possession of such knowledge then can never be disputed, and the validity of these concepts can never be falsified by any contingent experience, for disputing or falsifying anything would already have presupposed their very existence. As a matter of fact, a situation in which these categories of action would cease to have a real existence could itself never be observed, for making an observation, too, is an action.” — Hans-Hermann Hoppe, Economic Science and the Austrian Method 

You have to consider that Talbot's book is for beginners and that it oversimplifies a lot of stuff. In this case, explaining Aristotle's ethics in terms of 'the right action' makes it easy to compare his view on ethics with that of Kant, who believed that the right action can be determined using the categorical imperative, and with that of Mill, who believed that the right action is the one that causes more happiness. But this is a simplification. So the problem is not Aristotle, but Talbot. I'll just list the inaccuracies: 

I highly recommend Anscombe's Modern Moral Philosophy if you want to see the contrast between Aristotle and modern ethics. If you want to delve into the details of Aristotle's views on practical reason Wiggins' Deliberation and Practical Reason is good. 

The relation between needs and public policy is not straightforward. Discussions about what people "really" need are hard to settle, and even if people agree that X is needed, a lot of questions concerning how to satisfy X and how important is to satisfy it, given that we also need A, B and C, have to be answered. Also, in some situations, there might be a conflict between satisfying need X and being just, brave or honest, and it's not clear that we should always put needs on top of these other values. Since your question is tagged as a reference request, I highly recommend David Wiggins' "Needs, Need, Needing", available here, if you wanna delve into the topic of needs, "Claims of Need", also by Wiggins, is an excellent paper, but is not available online. Your question is too open ended to give a meaningful reply. In a sense, every major brand of moral theory tries to tell you what is needed to make a better world, or to do the right thing, or to be a flourishing human being; but the notion of need seems to acquire meaning only after we decide which of these things are really worth getting. 

Is finding a solution for a problem in a given context is an attempt to find a solution for the problem in another context? For example, it seems some of the hardest problems of real analysis were not solved till their solutions were found in the context of geometry. Update: I think it makes the question more clear if I provide an example. Lets say I want to prove if x+y=x+z, then y=z, where x,y,z $\in F$, where $F$ is a an algebraic field with operation "+". For example for this problem I can think of context where solution exits and that would be the ring of integers. If 1+2=2+1 then I can show 1=1. Now once this solution is found using this context of integers I can now apply this to the original problem in the context of field. Now what I was asking was that should such a solution exists in some contexts (context as used in example above) for a problem to be solvable. I do not know the background science behind this but it would be great if references can be introduced so I can get to know the right terminology. 

It is unnecessary. Praxeology: The Methodology of Austrian Economics by Murray N. Rothbard ...Moreover, even if verbal economics could be successfully translated into mathematical symbols and then translated into English so as to explain the conclusions, the process makes no sense and violates the great scientific principle of Occam’s Razor: avoiding unnecessary multiplication of entities… ...Although himself a mathematical economist, the mathematician son of Carl Menger wrote a trenchant critique of the idea that mathematical presentation in economics is necessarily more precise than ordinary language: Consider, for example, the statements (2) To a higher price of a good, there corresponds a lower (or at any rate not a higher) demand. (2') If p denotes the price of, and q the demand for, a good, then q = f(p) and dq/dp = f' (p) ≤ 0 Those who regard the formula (2') as more precise or "more mathematical" than the sentence (2) are under a complete misapprehension … the only difference between (2) and (2') is this: since (2') is limited to functions which are differentiable and whose graphs, therefore, have tangents (which from an economic point of view are not more plausible than curvature), the sentence (2) is more general, but it is by no means less precise: it is of the same mathematical precision as (2'). Mathematics versus Economic Logic by Ludwig von Mises ...The deliberations which result in the formulation of an equation are necessarily of a nonmathematical character. The formulation of the equation is the consummation of our knowledge; it does not directly enlarge our knowledge. […] No such constant relations exist, however, between economic elements. The equations formulated by mathematical economics remain a useless piece of mental gymnastics and would remain so even it they were to express much more than they really do. ...The mathematical method is at a loss to show how, from a state of nonequilibrium, those actions spring up which tend toward the establishment of equilibrium. It is, of course, possible to indicate the mathematical operations required for the transformation of the mathematical description of a definite state of nonequilibrium into the mathematical description of the state of equilibrium. But these mathematical operations by no means describe the market process actuated by the discrepancies in the price structure. The differential equations of mechanics are supposed to describe precisely the motions concerned at any instant of the time traveled through. The economic equations have no reference whatever to conditions as they really are in each instant of the time interval between the state of nonequilibrium and that of equilibrium. Only those entirely blinded by the prepossession that economics must be a pale replica of mechanics will underrate the weight of this objection. A very imperfect and superficial metaphor is not a substitute for the services rendered by logical economics... 

Do you think we as humans in general use certain prove strategies to prove things? Regardless of the topic being mathematics or any other topics, do you think we have finite and limited ways of approaching proof-related problems? For example, see this. If the above is true this means they are certain strategies that we need to follow, where do you think the creativity comes in? If they are certain strategies to follow, where do you think the creativity comes in? Does it come in come in when we try to apply a given strategy to a problem. How does proving things in mathematics differ from real world? 

Preamble: I think we have this sort of questions, where we are required to find a solution for them. For example, what is the area of a circle?. I think the way to solve these problems is to try to find similar problems. If the solution to the similar problems does not apply, then we try to figure out why, and this might help us to find the right solution. However, we have another type of problems, where we need to establish the truth of something. For example, proving a theorem, which are in nature different from the first type of questions. I do not think the same approach as before can be applied for these problems. I do not think there exist recipes or structures to follow either once it comes to proving things, but I do think there should be certain strategies or plan as you wish to approach these in mathematics? Questions: Based on the above introduction, I have the following questions:
