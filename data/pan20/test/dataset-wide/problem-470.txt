With out completely removing the cranks and bottom bracket, how can I tell when it's time to replace my bottom bracket? The current symptom is a slightly 'rough' feeling when I pedal. It's not constant, and it's not the pedals - I've swapped them out recently with nearly new ones. 

The first place I look for 'unusual' parts is Loose Screws. They have Ultegra and Dura Ace bar end shifters available. My second source is Rivendell Bicycle Works - They have a couple of different options. Not sure what you consider a reasonable price, but $100 US seems to be the ballpark for new shifters. Finally - you can always try eBay for used parts, but that is hit and miss for both quality and selection when dealing with more obscure parts like these. 

Having ridden since the early 80's I've been through this twice, once with aluminum frames and now with carbon fiber. As high end competition bikes were made of the materials there were questions of durability. Over time, as the frames became widely available, those concerns were shown to be largely baseless. I believe most frame builders warranty carbon frames for life now. I personally know of at least two riders with carbon fiber bikes that have been ridden in excess of 100,000 miles. That said, you should periodically inspect the frame for cracks and wear, especially at stress points like around the bottom bracket (just like you would with any frame). 

Pivots do get dirty; give it a thorough cleaning with degreaser and then drop a few drops of chain lube on the pivots. While you are doing this, dial all the barrel adjusters back to their beginning positions. Check the derailleur cage and make sure it is not bent. Make sure the derailleur is mounted to the frame properly. The cage should be exactly parallel to the chain rings, and it should be placed low enough on the frame that the teeth of the largest cog barely clear the bottom of the cage. With the cable and chain loose, ensure that the derailleur cage moves freely by hand. You can take this chance to begin to adjust the limit screws. Start with the low side, making sure it easily comes to rest to properly shift to the small ring when there is no tension on the cable. At this point it should be clear whether or not the derailleur is functioning properly. With the cable housings detached from the guides Attempt to move the derailleur by gently pulling the cable by hand near the shifters. If this works the problem is likely in your shifters, or with friction in the cable housings. If you can shift it by hand, this is a good time to start to dial in the high limit adjustment. If you make it this far, adjust the cable tension and dial in the shifting with the barrel adjusters. 

On my reasonably flat commute I average around 16 mph on my road bike, but your average speed is dependent on many different factors. A general rule of thumb is that if you are switching from a mountain bike with knobbies to a road bike you will be between 15-20% faster at the same watts/effort. Typically that's only a change of 2-3 mph. I teach a bike commuting workshop, and one of the most common questions is whether to switch from a mountain bike to a road bike in order to increase speed. Typically, I tell people to try three things first: 

While it's true that your hips rocking indicates that the seat is too high, there is a different rule of thumb for knee pain related to the fore and aft position of the saddle. It's easy to remember: 

If you carefully wipe off the excess from your shoes/cleats and the pedals, you won't be tracking anything around your house after your ride. If after a second application the squeak remains it may be a problem with the bearings in the pedals - some can be overhauled, but others it makes more sense just to replace. 

If you decide to go the trailer route you can use plans like these to build your own PVC racks to keep the bikes upright. 

If you need to fit a large number of bikes into a small(ish) space, hanging them on the wall is usually the best option. The simplest and cheapest route is to mount hooks into the studs which will normally be at 16" centers. If you want different spacing you can mount a header like a 2x6 or 2x8 to the to the wall and attach the hooks to the header. We have a bike cage in our parking garage that we patterned after the plan below. By offsetting the racks/hooks we have space for 18 bikes in what used to be one oversize parking space. 

If your rims are bending under normal loads there are a couple of things you should check and maintain: 

I have several extra tires, two on a spare wheelset, and others in a bundle. I am not riding as much as I was a year ago, so I will not be wearing out tires as fast as I was. What is the best way and conditions to store these tires so that the rubber doesn't just crack and split when I put them on wheels and pump them up? Note: I don't know if it makes a difference, but I live at about 5000' of elevation in a very dry climate; forced air heating is used in my apartment about 6 months a year. More info as an example: I had tires mounted on wheels, deflated, hanging from ceiling hooks. I don't know how long it was that I hadn't used them but it was probably 12+ months. When I inflated them a week ago to the recommended pressure the sidewalls showed cracking parallel to the rim on the whole, or nearly the whole circumference of the tire. 

In addition, it's unlikely that your 28mm tires weigh the same as your 23mm tires, so the additional weight is going to increase your resistance. In all, it looks like if you are trying to minimize your rolling resistance on this smooth section of road, experiment with the narrower tires at different pressures. Just be aware that wind resistance is far more important at any significant speed. Wearing a slightly flappy shirt may make a bigger difference than the 5-10psi change, or the 5mm of extra rubber.
