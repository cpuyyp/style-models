I would advise to not use your child for weight resistance training. Who will spot you? How about just play with your kid. 

Are you going to increase your caloric intake to make up for the calories that you'd burn by working out? If you have the same level of physical activity but eat the exact amount of calories as required, nothing would happen. If you increase physical activity and increase the calories to the exact amount, you would gain muscle. If you increase physical activity and maintain the calories that you average now, you would lose fat. The problem is, nobody can predict exactly what is required. So then, that's why bodybuilders consume too many calories and gain fat during "bulking". It's better to eat too much than to not eat enough and end up burning muscle as energy. The human body wants to store fat reserves for the winter and times w/o food. It will burn muscle that it decides are not necessary when in times of depleted caloric intake. 

I'm 27. Normally work as a programmer. I've been tracking my blood pressure and heart rate and at rest, they're quite high (around 120/80 and 90+ bpm). I decided to go for a run today, combined with some squats and push-ups. My heart rate was still safe for my age (around 140 bpm), but my blood pressure shot up to 166/93. I normally get dizzy after a workout, but I realize now that it's due to blood pressure, not heart rate. So, the question is.. how should I deal with this? Should I be aiming for less intense exercises? Should I be exercising more or less? Is exercise a good way of lowering blood pressure or is that something solely solved by better nutrition (and cutting down on the lamb)? 

For your specific task (calculating burned cals), no matter what fitness band you choose, it's still a calculation to figure out how many calories you've burnt. With any calculation, there's a level of tolerance and you need to be able to accept the tolerance. If you're just worried about the number of calories burned, you could calculate it yourself and be pretty close. With that said, a fitness band is an awesome accessory to help you reach your goals. But what are your expectations? Your question is regarding weight lifting, but your inner question is about calculating calories burned. For weight lifting, you'll find almost no benefit from the FitBit Flex or Force - but they may be helpful for overall fitness. Some of the most important metrics (IMHO) are missing in a lot of them - such as temperature and heart rate. Buying a band now instead of later may mean that you're just going to buy one later as well as you'll want the features of the newer models. I won't try to regurgitate the information in some REALLY good blog posts about the subject, so I'll link them here: 

I agree with Freakyuser's advice to simply make it not boring. Zombies + adrenaline are a surprisingly exciting combination. Don't push yourself too hard. Don't do a full exercise routine just because it's recommended somewhere. If I can't even do 3km, trying to do 5km will kill motivation. Your willpower is shared between other aspects of life too, like career, family, and finances. If you have a particularly bad day, it's likely you'll end up quitting exercise early on. I exercise only until I get my second wind. I push myself to 100%, as far as I think I can go. Then I push myself an additional 10%, something like running to the next tree or lamp post. If you still feel like going back and not going further, then that's a good time to go back. Otherwise, it'll be discouraging to go tomorrow. The book 4 Hour Body also has a lot of short exercises for people with little time. For those who can't make the time to exercise, I highly suggest that you do. The most productive periods of my life have been when I was fit. You'll easily be twice as effective, especially with high-creativity jobs like programming. 

Yoga will help with balance (coordination) and stretching. I'm almost confident that it will not "fix" muscle strength imbalances alone. However there are many benefits from yoga which would enrich your life. So, my answer is, "it won't hurt but it will not fix your concern by itself." 

As mentioned in my comment, I'm extremely excited and waiting for Amigo - probably to the point that I won't buy one until this comes out or one comes out with these features. 

Edit: Also, if you have recently lost a lot of weight, you may have extra skin. This will eventually tighten over time. However this is another reason people get plastic surgery - because they're impatient. 

If you want to make gains like a 20 year old, you'll have to have the testosterone and estrogen levels of a 20 year old. On the surface, this doesn't answer your question... but it does, please follow: Your first question is, "How much muscle/strength could I really expect to gain over age 50?" I am not sure that this is answerable. In what way would you like to measure it? The second question is, "can I make great gains?" This is also an opinion question, I believe you'll make great gains but will you believe that they're great gains? The third question is, "no gains?" This one I can answer, YOU WILL MAKE GAINS. As @rrirower pointed out, gains will be slower than you remembered but they will happen. I know bodybuilders who NEVER competed or took the sport seriously until they were eligible for the masters class - and they did well. The fourth question is, "expect to lose as I age?" If you maintain an active lifestyle, your body will be forced to maintain as well. You'll only "lose" when your body doesn't feel that it needs the muscle anymore (because you're not lifting) which it will then burn for energy, just as we burn fat and muscle for energy in a caloric deficit (diet). Therefore, you will make gains. I hope you will be patient enough to accept them as great gains. 

I'm not fit. I'm in my early 30s. I struggle to do 10 push-ups, crunches/sit-ups hurt my back, and I can't jog more than 5 minutes without feeling exhausted. I'm not too fat, just crossing the 'overweight' line in regards to BMI. I've picked up a few health magazines, and the proposed exercises are way out of my league - I can barely do a few push-ups, much less do them between other exercises. I find gyms a little too expensive and out of my daily route and will probably quit if I have to rely on one. I've searched on the Internet, but I can't really figure how reliable those sites and blogs are. Right now, I'm interested in just doing about 30 mins of exercises a day before my morning shower. I figure if I can comfortably maintain a routine of 30 mins of exercise a day, I'd be in shape to go higher. If possible it should be without equipment, though dumbbells or anything available at home should be fine. I'm not so interested in strength/muscle building, but in improving stamina, not getting diseases, improving posture, and just plain feeling good. 

Added 2/27/14 I just wanted to point to the Moov - COMPANY LINK HERE, Amigo, move over! :) The Moov is awesome. 

You grow when you sleep. When I was competing I would take simplysleep to make sure that I got 9 - 10 hours of sleep a day. IMHO, sleep is only second to eating in terms of growing muscle. Ironically lifting weights is a distant 3rd, especially in terms of willpower. Anyone can lift weights. Few can get enough sleep. Fewer can stick to a diet. As much as our minds won't allow it, our bodies love a consistent routine. Eat every 2 hours, work out in a routine as scheduled (same time), and go to bed at the same time and wake at the same time - and preferably not by an alarm clock. Your body doesn't really care that it's the weekend, your mind does.
