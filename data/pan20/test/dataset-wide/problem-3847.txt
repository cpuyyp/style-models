Suppose that $G$ is compact, connected, and semisimple. Let $T\subseteq G$ be a maximal torus. Take the complexification $G_{\mathbb{C}}$ of $G$, and choose a Borel subgroup $B\subseteq G_{\mathbb{C}}$ containing $T$. Using the Iwasawa decomposition $G_{\mathbb{C}}=GB$, we see that $G$ acts transitively on $G_{\mathbb{C}}/B$. Also, the stabilizer of the identity coset is $T$, giving us a $G$-equivariant diffeomorphism $G/T\cong G_{\mathbb{C}}/B$. The thing to note is that $G_{\mathbb{C}}/B$ naturally carries the structure of a complex projective variety. Hence, $G/T$ inherits the projective variety structure for which the isomorphism $G/T\cong G_{\mathbb{C}}/B$ is an isomorphism of projective varieties. Note, however, that the projective variety structure of $G/T$ depends on the choice of $B$ containing $T$, or equivalently, the choice of positive roots for the adjoint representation of $T$ on $\mathfrak{g}_{\mathbb{C}}$. 

I'm not sure you will find this answer to be satisfactory, as it addresses only a special case. Nevertheless, a unipotent conjugacy class in $SL_n(\mathbb{C})$ is the same as a conjugacy class of a nilpotent $n\times n$ matrix. The latter classes are indexed by Jordan canonical forms, and hence also by the partitions of $n$. So, there are as many unipotent conjugacy classes in $SL_n(\mathbb{C})$ as there are partitions of $n$. I do not know of a nice formula for the partition function, but I believe it has a nice generating function. 

Let $G$ be a compact connected semisimple Lie group. The algebro-geometric definition of the affine Grassmannian is the coset space $$\mathcal{G}r=G_{\mathbb{C}}(\mathcal{\mathbb{C}((t))}/G_{\mathbb{C}}(\mathbb{C}[[t]]).$$ Technically, $\mathcal{G}r$ is an ind-scheme over $\mathbb{C}$, realized as an inductive limit of schemes. On the other hand, we have a differential-geometric version of the affine Grassmannian described in Chapters 7 and 8 of Pressley-Segal. In particular, they construct $\mathcal{G}r_0^{\mathfrak{g}}$. This is homotopy-equivalent to $\Omega G$. I am looking for a reference that explicitly relates these two notions of the affine Grassmannian. In particular, I am seeking answers to some of the questions below. 

Let $G$ be a connected, simply-connected complex semisimple group. Let $$\mathcal{G}r=G(\mathcal{\mathbb{C}((t))})/G(\mathcal{\mathbb{C}[[t]]})$$ be the affine Grassmannian of $G$. We know that $\mathcal{G}r$ has a natural increasing filtration $$\mathcal{G}r_0\subseteq\mathcal{G}r_1\subseteq\ldots\subseteq\mathcal{G}r_n\subseteq\ldots\subseteq\mathcal{G}r,$$ indexed by pole order considerations. Now, fix a maximal torus $T\subseteq G$. We also know that $\mathcal{G}r$ has a stratification into the subvarieties $$\mathcal{G}r^{\lambda}:=G(\mathbb{C}[[t]])t^{\lambda},$$ where $\lambda$ ranges over the dominant coweights of $T$. Given a fixed $n$, I am seeking a description of those dominant coweights $\lambda$ for which $\mathcal{G}r^{\lambda}\subseteq\mathcal{G}r_n$. I would appreciate any references that might provide some details concerning this description. 

Take a ring $A$ that is not an integral domain, and let $d\in A$ be a zero-divisor. Consider the polynomial $dx-1$. Since $d$ is a zero-divisor in $A$, it is a zero-divisor in every ring $B$ containing $A$ as a subring. In particular, $d$ is not a unit in any such $B$. Therefore, the polynomial $dx-1$ cannot have a root in any $B$. 

Let $\frak{b}\subseteq\frak{g}$ denote the Lie algebra of your Borel $B$. There is a natural $G$-equivariant isomorphism $\tilde{\frak{g}}\cong G\times_B\frak{b}$ of vector bundles over $G/B$, where $G\times_B\frak{b}$ is the associated bundle arising from the adjoint representation of $B$ on $\frak{b}$. Let us take $B$ to be the standard Borel of upper-triangular matrices of unit determinant, and consider the maximal torus $T\subseteq B$ of diagonal matrices. Under the adjoint representation restricted to $T$, $\frak{b}$ decomposes into irreducible subrepresentations of weights $0$ and $2$. Conjecturally, anyway, I would not be surprised if you could use this to show that $\tilde{\frak{g}}\cong\mathcal{O}(0)\oplus\mathcal{O}(2)$. Still, I am not sure about this, and there are a few details to be resolved. I hope this is useful. 

A purely coordinate-free argument might be to think about what happens when you take a curve with a bitangent, and then deform the curve so that the two tangent points come together -- clearly this should produce a flex. We already understand how bitangents give rise to simple nodes on the dual curve. On the side of the dual curve, this deformation would correspond to taking a nodal curve and letting the "nodal part" shrink to a single point. Squint and you get a cusp. (There used to be also a big computation/handwave in this answer, but on a second reading it was really not illuminating at all.) 

I don't think this is a very well posed question. For one, you probably don't mean a morphism of schemes from $X_\text{ét}$ to $X_\mathrm{Zar}$ but a morphism of sites. In any case, an open immersion is étale, so there is a morphism from the Zariski site to the étale site. It obviously preserves fibered products. (Under mild hypotheses this is true for any morphism of sites.) All this means is that an étale sheaf may always be thought of as a Zariski sheaf. Without knowing more details about what you are interested in it's hard to give a reference. But you could read: 

So it seems your question is: if we know that $\overline M_{g,n}$ is of general type, is the same true for $\overline M_{g,n'}$ with $n' \geq n$? The answer is yes, and is a special case of the main theorem of: J. Kollár, Subadditivity of the Kodaira dimension : fibers of general type. As far as I know there are no explicit counterexamples to the stronger statement that if $\overline M_{g,n}$ is of general type, then the same true for $\overline M_{g',n}$ with $g' \geq g$ and $n' \geq n$, but it is almost certainly false: for instance, Farkas has proved that $\overline M_{22}$ is of general type and also that $\kappa(\overline M_{23}) \geq 2$, which he however conjectured to be sharp. Also note that Logan's function $f(g)$ such that $\overline M_{g,n}$ is of general type for $n \geq f(g)$ is not monotone in $g$. 

Let me give a rather trivial remark: $K_0(\mathrm {Var}_k)$ doesn't remember any nontrivial extensions, but Voevodsky's category does. For instance, let $C$ be a smooth projective curve of positive genus, and let $x$ and $y$ be two points on $C$. Then $h^1(C \setminus \{x,y\})$ is a mixed motive (whatever that means) which depends nontrivially on the class of $[x]-[y]$ in $J(C)$. But the expression $[C] - [x]-[y] \in K_0(\mathrm{Var}_k)$ is obviously independent of the choice of $x$ and $y$. 

These notes by Dan Edidin: $URL$ give a very readable account of the construction of the moduli stack of curves over $\mathrm{Spec}(\mathbb Z)$ for $g \geq 3$ via the Hilbert scheme. I am not sure if this is what you are looking for, though, depending on what you mean with "from beginning to end": certainly there are several steps left as pointers to the literature. 

Let $\mathbf V$ be a representation of the symmetric group $S_n$, say irreducible. Pieri's formula describes the induced representation $$ \mathrm{Ind}_{S_n \times S_k}^{S_{n+k}} \mathbf V \boxtimes \mathbf 1 $$ in terms of Young diagrams: it decomposes as a direct sum of representations obtained by adding $k$ boxes to the Young diagram of $\mathbf V$, no two in the same column. On the other hand one can also write $$ \mathrm{Ind}_{S_n \times S_k}^{S_{n+k}}\mathbf V \boxtimes \mathbf 1 \cong \bigoplus_{\binom{n+k}n} \mathbf V.$$ To make this canonical one needs to choose, for each $n$-element subset $S$ of $[n+k]$, a permutation $\pi \in S_{n+k}$ carrying $\{1,\ldots,n\}$ to $S$. We could say that we choose the lexicographically first such permutation, for instance, or anything else that's more convenient. Can one make Pieri's formula explicit in this latter formula, by directly writing down a decomposition of the right hand side into irreducible representations?
