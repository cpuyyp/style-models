The important point is that its not that there was something called ontology which became intertwined with something called theology and produced a third thing called metaphysics. Its rather a complete reverse of this: metaphysics has always left unthought the identity between ontology and theology that has been implicit in it. Its only now, at the end of a process that separates something we call "ontology" from something we call "theology" that the relationship between them comes into question at all. 

These limits are outside of the world, and thus outside of the possibility of proposition. They can be shown, but not said, not put into a propositional form, for every proposition concerns the world, that is, concerns facts (e.g., 4.1 "A proposition presents the existence and non-existence of atomic facts." [alternatively Sachverhalte is rendered "states of affairs" rather than "atomic facts"]) and what can be made into a proposition is therefore itself a fact. The contents of the world, in a certain sense, cannot change; the world is only facts. I do not mean to imply that change is impossible; merely that "the world" for Wittgenstein does not expand and contract: it is always the totality of facts. Yet this says nothing about the limits of the world, just as from inside a windowless room, I can say nothing about what the room is like from the outside. Nevertheless that there are limits can be shown, even if not through propositions (for any limit which can be rendered as a proposition is therefore a fact and therefore a part of the world rather than its limit). So, then, what is it that might lie beyond the limits of the world? There are, I think, at least three important examples Wittgenstein gives in the Tractatus: logical form (see esp. 4.12), ethics (6.421), and the subject (5.632). It is in the discussion surrounding this last point (i.e. the discussion of solipsism from 5.63-5.641) that we find what might be most relevant for understanding why the world of the happy man might be different from that of the unhappy man. Thus, we find the very pregnant comment in 5.63: 

The reasoning breaks the definition. I made the blunder of assuming that doubt could be meaningfully defined in such a situation. 

Are there any current modern mathematical or scientific arguments in favor of eternal return? I have read several against it here on this site. One which I could think of is that the Universe might not be entirely governed by mathematical rules. There could be a different kind of logic at the base of it all, making time circular. Causality might not be an entirely correct assumption. But these are too presumptive and bold. Does QM suggest finite number of states for matter under causal laws? And if so, does it follow that these finite states can only have a finite configuration under infinite space and time? 

I'm not certain that "compatibilism" itself is something that can be falsified. This is because compatibilism, far from being a single theory, is really more of a classification that covers several different kinds of theories. A rough analogy (though inaccurate, as all analogies are to some extent) would be to try to falsify "quantum mechanics." Various interpretations of quantum mechanics can be offered and those specific forms of interpretation might themselves be open to falsifiability, but quantum mechanics itself does not seem to be falsifiable, in any rigorous sense. Your suggested falsification of compatibilism, i.e., by showing that there is no such thing as mind, seems to rest on a notion that compatibilism requires dualism. In fact, most compatibilist accounts I'm familiar with actually are based not on a dualism, but on some account of mind that is inseparable from physical reality, i.e., some form of physicalism, epiphenomenalism or nominalism, rather than any version of dualism. Dualism seems, prima facie, to support libertarianism. Thus, even if one could prove that "mind" (whatever that might be) doesn't exist, many versions of compatibilism would still be applicable, since they do not rely on a robust account of mind as anything other than a physical or epiphenomenal or linguistic construct. In short, you are right to be skeptical of this as an answer. For example---a version I was once told in conversation---one might hold that the question of "free will" really devolves into a question of whether or not we can assign praise or blame to someone for their actions. Prima facie, we do this all the time, without necessarily needing a particular theory of mind; we instead have a theory of when an action counts as praisable or blamable or neither. We can then call any action to which we can assign the actor "praise" or "blame" a "free action," regardless of either the status of causation or of the actors mind. This would be a version of what I'm calling a nominalist theory of compatibilism. Such a view is, I think, utterly unfalsifiable, though it isn't strictly metaphysical either. In general, on the various positions responding to the free will problem, the best internet resource I am aware of is Honderich's DETERMINISM AND FREEDOM PHILOSOPHY WEBSITE. There are several options here that your discussion doesn't consider, including strict determinism, and the options which Honderich calls "neither compatibilism nor incompatibilism." (Honderich's main issue is that we do not have a sufficient account of what "origination" might be, i.e., how it is an action might be said to be the free choice of an actor, precisely what you are getting at with your last paragraph). Finally, I'm not sure if "falsifiability" is the correct standard to use for philosophical rather than empirical problems (and Popper himself notes that there are parts of the scientific method that cannot be explained in terms of "falsifiability," i.e., unfalsifiable notions which science itself draws on). 

Let's define logic as: A statement and it's opposite, obtained by applying the "not" operator, both cannot be true. The not operator is applied to the part of the sentence describing action or attribute. Example: a) The apple is red. The apple is not red. b) Swamy crossed over the fence. Swamy did not cross over the fence. If in a set of statements, there exist two statements which are both true, and are opposites, then the set is inconsistent. Do all paradoxes fall under the set of inconsistent statements or set of statements? (Assuming of course that I have reasonably and objectively defined "logic", and other terms). 

Assume that doubt is meaningfully defined. Or let's say we define doubt as , both the statement under doubt, and it's complement can be true or false, we do not know, the uncertainty exists. Imagine an ultimate doubter. In this scenario, the doubter can doubt everything, including him being in doubt. The doubter can make the sentence “I doubt that I am doubting”. This sentence does not break reasoning. Let me explain how. I doubt (A), that I am doubting(B). These are two different levels of doubt. This is a self referential doubt. Doubting that “I am doubting”, does not mean that the doubter is not doubting. Doubting entails both the possibilities, “I am doubting”, can be true, or “I am doubting” can be false. So the chain of recursion goes something like this: 

The point isn't that Spinoza's language is outmoded or that his Scholastic terminology distorts what he's trying to say. Its that Spinoza's writing-style in the Ethics makes virtually ever term he uses imbued with odd meanings and it would sound just as odd had he written it in Dutch or even English. 

Longer niceties: You're right to highlight the evasion in the "everyone." In §51, Heidegger address this more or less head on, where he deals with the similar idea: "One also dies at the end, but for now one is not involved." 

If God exists, then God is omnipotent, omniscient, and morally perfect. If God is omnipotent, then God has the power to eliminate all evil. If God is omniscient, then God knows when evil exists. If God is morally perfect, then God has the desire to eliminate all evil. Evil exists. If evil exists and God exists, then either God doesn't have the power to eliminate all evil, or doesn't know when evil exists, or doesn't have the desire to eliminate all evil. Therefore, God doesn't exist 

We know that a long time ago life emerged from a bunch of amino acids. When I look at the world around me, I notice that it is made up mostly of inanimate matter. Yet this same inanimate matter must have come together in various permutation and combinations to provide a subjective experience - me. How is it possible? What are the various theories for the same? My own thoughts: Matter might not be entirely inanimate. The world is an illusion and everything is made on patterns involving the consciousness which was ever present. 

This(C) is false, since we have already established in (A) that we are doubting, so it’s complement in a sense, that “I doubt, that I am doubting”, has to be True. Or, am I wrong somewhere in logic? ( I get my obvious current mistake, but trying to reword it meaningfully) 

If representing "how it really was" is a chimera then what is the task of history? History cannot be objective; it is always partial. "Not even the dead will be safe from the enemy", i.e., their history will always be re-written by the victors and the powerful to serve their own ends. (Hence the danger which lies in "handing itself [the dead and what they represent] over as the tool of the ruling classes"). Or as Löwy puts it: 

It's also worth noting that "I will die" again sounds like it has a temporal displacement: "I will die, someday, but not yet". What's important is how this is held: 

What's at stake in this isn't just something in the imagination; it isn't even really about death per se; its something in one's attitude towards life itself. Authentic being-towards-death "brings [Dasein] face to face with the possibility to be itself" (p. 245). It's this encounter---with the possibility of being itself that ultimately characterises authentic being-towards-death. 

$URL$ Both these arguments look sound to me. You only have to argue that "nothingness", can exist. From there it's a short step to saying that it always exists. In the second case particularly, linking nothingness to the empty set, say that the empty set exists, then it is always a member of all sets that exist, due to it's simplicity. Of course, one would never be able to detect nothing, since one can only detect physical objects which exists, so actually proving the argument is impossible. 

Everything in thought is a comparison. So, when you say "lying to yourself". There are two possibilities. 1) There is an objective truth of the matter. You tell yourself anything but the objective truth. In that case yes, you would be lying to yourself. Within this possibility again, you might or might not be aware of the objective truth. If you are aware of the objective truth, then there is no way you can lie to yourself and not know that you are lying. If you are not aware of the objective truth, and tell yourself otherwise, then you are lying to yourself without knowing that you are lying to yourself. (Like the example of the woman you gave above). 2) There is no objective truth of the matter. In this scenario, it is really hard to deduce if you are indeed lying to yourself. In fact, it might be impossible to do so. If the only truth is subjective, then from your point of view, the best subject is you, yourself. So whatever you tell yourself will happen to be true. 

This then is the mean: a point that lies between the two extremes of excess and deficiency, so as to be what the "prudent man" would choose. But there are some caveats to be observed about this notion of mean. First of all, there is not always a mean to be found: 

Substance refers, literally, to what "stands under" a thing. It is something distinct from the attributes of the thing, the "what-it-is" (quidditas, to borrow Scholastic terminology) that makes it, e.g., a person or chariot or whatever. Nagasena's point is that there are no substances in that sense, i.e., there are only the attributes (technically skandas, which is more normally translated "aggregates"), so that there is nothing to the chariot apart from its attributes. Hence, there is nothing substantial to the chariot. It's not precisely that the chariot is nothing; it's that the name "chariot" refers to nothing but these attributes. In your terms, the synergy is nothing other than its attributes (i.e. it's not a superset of the attributes; it's not really anything at all). If you want to term this a "substance" that's fine, but it's not a substance in the sense that Nagasena is attempting to deny, precisely because the concept of "chariot" doesn't add anything to the wheels, the axel, the reins, etc. To put the argument in a slightly different way, imagine the chariot is destroyed and its parts scatter. There's a wheel over here, the axel's over there, the flag pole sunk into the sea, etc. Nagasena's point is (roughly) that there aren't any fewer things than there were before. To move a bit deeper with the argument from a Buddhist perspective, the important thing about these attributes is that they are nothing other than percepts, feelings, etc. ("phenomenal facts"). They don't refer to anything other than the operation of consciousness per se. The chariot isn't a thing; it isn't there at all. It's simply brought into our perception by the operation of consciousness. In Western philosophy, Nagasena's chariot argument is known as the Ship of Theseus, though it's usually discussed with a different end in mind, i.e., the identity of the thing rather than its existence or non-existence. 

The result of Godel's theorems was that we knew for sure that a formal axiomatic system wasn't capable to derive all of mathematics. The math derived under the system cannot be consistent and complete. Why isn't the onus of failure put on mathematics as well? Seems to me like if mathematics cannot be derived under any formal axiomatic system, then the problem is with mathematics as well, because you'd certainly need a formal axiomatic system to derive any complete sentence. How do we even know then for sure that mathematics is complete and consistent?(If these words still apply) 

I understand the value of falsifiable beliefs. Often they make predictions, and are classified as scientific ideas, useful in churning out predictions. But do unfalsifiable beliefs have any value? Philosophically or mathematically or otherwise? I know value is a little vague, but consider for example the concept of eternal return. If true it would have a large impact. But, then it's unfalsifiable. Can't be verified at all. So a sentence A, if true would have a large impact, but it's unfalsifiable at the same moment, would you assume any importance to such sentences? 

I don't think this is an answer, but its a long series of comments. TLDR; there are many more considerations to the problem of evil than you seem to address. You've missed a key element of Leibniz's theodicy, and in a way that seems to grossly distort his thought. God creates the best of all possible worlds, yes, but this is not to say that there is some existing catalogue of possible worlds from which God chose the best one. Such an account doesn't really obviate the problem of evil; it simply denies that God is omnipotent (since he---apparently---couldn't create world without evil). Leibniz's actual view rely on a certain form of teleology: the best possible world is a world that contains suffering because (for whatever reason) it allows for a more full expression of good than would be possible in a world in which there is no suffering (thus, for example, his Discourse on Metaphysics §3). This comes quite close to what you outline as the first interpretation of Augustine's view, and is actually quite a classical argument traceable back to at least Plato and---possibly, depending on how one understands him---Heraclitus. Incidentally, Augustinian theodicy (whether or not this qualifies as the original Christian theodicy---and I'd hesitate to assert that!) certainly depends on freedom of the will. For freedom of the will is what allows man to withdraw from God and so to create the possibility of evil. Whatever you may think of the notion of evil as the privation of good, it seems irresponsible to dismiss this view out of hand, for it ties back directly to the heart of the question: is the existence of evil (which very few deny) contrary to the existence of God? If evil is created by some means that God (for whatever reason) places beyond his control, can he be blamed for it? I don't mean to rhetorically suggest that the answer to this question is "no"; it cannot be denied, however, that it is a question that deserves consideration---for if God is blameless in the existence of evil, then no amount of evil would seem to contradict the existence of God. Scholastic Christian thought has tended to argue that one can regard God as not being "good" in our sense without thereby asserting that God is evil, immoral, or does anything other than what is good. God's goodness is taken to be not a different goodness from our own, but more perfect, and so occasionally manifesting itself in forms that seem to us evil. God can appear to be immoral, according to human standards, but this is due to our finite inability to grasp the infinite goodness at work. This is why Aquinas and other's speak of humans as participating in the goodness of God, albeit to greater and lesser degrees of perfection; no one can attain the goodness of God, but one can approximate it. In this sense, morality isn't strictly redefined, since the same good is there for God as for humans, it is just that God is fully able to realise this good, while human beings are not. There may be something you find unpalatable in such answers, but surely that is not sufficient to reject an argument? Another way, perhaps with some similarities and overlap, can be found, for example, in the Bereshith Rabbah:
