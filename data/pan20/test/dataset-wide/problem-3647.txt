The answer largely depends on his training. How has he felt after his long runs and longer tempo runs and at what pace were they? I don't like to compare half times unless the half was run on some part of the same course as the marathon you're trying to estimate. [Warning: non-scientific advice ahead] All that being said, for a first marathon I'd suggest running the first 16 miles consistently at the easier of the two paces to gauge how he's holding up. If he feels strong at 16 pick up the pace and evaluate again at 20, then again at 23. In my marathons I've found that both physically and mentally it's easier for me to increase pace if I have targeted distance intervals. When I've gone out too fast, I've failed to maintain. I use 16 because that's a distance I'm very comfortable running and I can accurately tell how I feel at that point. Plus, there are only 10.2 miles to go :) I check again at 20 (the 10k left mark) and again at 23 (roughly a 5k) because those are easy distances to mentally "swallow" and I know how my body responds over them. They are also a nice way to mentally divide the remainder of the race. 

I found a software called UltraRunner 3 for Mac, I wonder if exists something like, but for windows. I would like to know if exists a software that given a gps route then could generate a plan for running all the route, I mean the software would split the route in small parts, then if there ir positive elevation then would say you haceto run at 10 mim/km. Then the software would allow you to change the intensity of all the parts of the route, thas exist something like for windows? 

From your posted schedule and your history mentioned in another comment I would think that running 1 long run per week at your current distance would be sufficient to keep you in shape to complete up to a half marathon with relatively low risk of injury (based on your stated history). Don't plan on being competitive, though. With only 1 slow long run a week you will lose speed. If you want to reduce that loss I would add in speed work once a week at least 2 days before/after your long run to allow for sufficient recovery to get the most out of each run. I would also alternate the type of speed work you do (intervals one week, tempo another) and I would suggest turning a few of your long runs into faster steady-state runs or fartleks. You could also play around with negative splitting a few long runs. That won't completely prevent losing a little speed but it should mitigate any loss. You're not going to get a definitive answer, I fear, because this is highly specific to your specific body/history/training needs. Conventional wisdom is that you can maintain fitness during the off season on 3 runs (2 short, one medium) for 5k/10k training (see this Q&A on winter maintenance) but your results will vary. Best of luck to you with this. 

General question: why would the upper glute area (piriformis, gluteus minimus, gluteus medius) get disproportionately tight and sore from running? For me, the tightness and soreness in this specific region seems out of proportion to other areas of my body. Nothing else gets this sore or tight. This area gets sore enough that it is the limiting factor in my recovery from longer runs. Following a long run, typically the rest of my body is ready to go again on schedule, while this area has yet to recover completely. Info specific to me: I am not currently doing weight training, but I think my strength is fairly balanced across all the muscle groups involved in running. My glutes have genetic capacity to be one of my stronger body parts; this area has never been my weak area. I am interested in improving my running technique, training methods, mobility or whatever else is required so that I do not over-stress these muscles. If more info is needed, please leave a comment and I'll update the question. UPDATE: 

I have my left soleus muscle more stronger than my other soleus, you can see it with no effort, I think it must be because of my form of running, my right leg is shorter so maybe that could be the problem, I'm asking just to know if is normal to have a soleus muscle more stronger than other.. Im trainning just running btw.. 

I always get hurt the index toe of my right foot when doing my long run, the nail is black and very thick. In my last run I applied a little vaseline, it was better but still the index toe get hurt. How can I protect better that toe. I bought new shoes, one size bigger. My long run is for 18-20k I saw Anton Krupicka to take of something from his toes when he was running with Kilian Jornet (Kilians' Quest) 

What does your current diet look like? What is your current marathon PR and what is leading you to think your diet may not have been quite right? You'll need to provide some insight into what you're currently eating before you can get any specific advice on what to change. There are many resources on the web that offer suggested plans and they all generally fall into similar recommendations. Marathon training burns a lot of carbs, how much you burn will differ based on your fitness level, experience, pace, and running economy. The general wisdom is that runners should be consuming a diet that is composed of between 65% and 70% carbohydrates. A typical marathon training diet is one that is around 65% carbohydrates,25% protein, and 10% fat. Here are several links to articles that will say roughly the same thing and give varying approaches to building your diet plan. You'll need to figure out what works best for your body through trial and error. 

In my long runs (about 25k) when I finnish the smell of my body is like ammonia, I have read in internet thats because of converting my muscles into energy, so Could I say that my body is not burning fat like it should be? the other question I would like to ask is, How do I know when my body is burning fat correctly? I mean there is some indicator? like the ammonia smell is to burning muscles? 

I take it that you feel the changes are quicker for you than in comparison with your friends or peers. You asked, "Is this just my body type?" So the question isn't limited to general principles. If you are seeing unusual results, it could be stress or lack of good lifestyle habits. Do you get enough sleep? Are you under psychological stress? Is your schedule regular? Psychological stress (even something as common as being a student in a challenging major) can increase your levels of catabolic hormones. You also asked, "is there any solution for this?" Yes. Focus on getting lots of rest, managing stress and having a regular schedule. You may see that you don't lose mass as quickly if your stress goes down and your lifestyle improves. 

I plan to drink Honey as my source of glycogen for a Ultra Marathon of 80 Kilometers and 4400 meters D+, I'm planning to do it between 12 and 14 hours, so my question is How much milliliters of Honey would I need? 

I mean not totally barefoot, I mean using VFF or something like Nike free run 3.0, in my long run I do a good 10-13k in barefoot, but after that my feets gets a lot of pain. I think my foots has been much stronger, and maybe it could be a good distance to run just 10k barefoot for maintaining stronger feets, and then to do long run with a cushioner shoe.. Edited: My Body weight is 83k, and my height is 1.80, I think running barefoot could be maybe something for people that weights <= 70 Kg on long distances, but for heavier people we must do just 10k or use maybe a middle cushion shoe like Saucony Kinvara 3 that alows you to run like a forefoot strike runner but alows you to run heel-strike too. 

First, the faq states "gear and gadgets used during exercise" is on-topic. So I am going to ask about the Samsung Galaxy Gear Smartwatch (or similar watches) and I hope that is OK. I would be interested in using a smartwatch as a full featured replacement for carrying my smartphone while running. I don't care about any phone-related functions. I don't even need to listen to music. I only care about tracking my workout in great detail. I want to record my route via GPS, my speed, my heart rate and even my cadence. I use a Zephyr HxM that provides cadence, heart rate, and other data. (I also have a Zephyr BioHarness.) Does anyone know if the capabilities of these new smartwatches that would make it possible to achieve my goals? If so, are there existing running apps that support this scenario? Finally, since the Zephyr HxM provides r-r interval data, does any smartwatch app record this data? Thanks
