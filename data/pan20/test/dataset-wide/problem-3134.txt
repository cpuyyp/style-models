Until the seventeenth century there were frequent alterations, but almost all for new places to be enfranchised, which I suspect isn't the sort of change you're thinking of. If you go back long enough, the counties were relatively stable, but the number of towns varied - for example, 88 in 1394, 81 in 1399, and 87 in 1421. By 1509, there were 98 boroughs, 37 shires, and 12 'urban counties'; Henry VIII added all the Welsh shires, of course, but even without that change, the number of seats grew steadily, and there were a third more members in 1558 than there were when he started. The odd town was dropped, as well. The overall number continued to rise until 1673, when the last constituencies were added; after that, no English constituencies changed until 1832. (The Scottish constituencies were added in 1707 and the Irish ones in 1801. I don't believe any were disenfranchised during this period.) The one exception to this century and half of stability was the case of Grampound, in Corwall, disenfranchised by Act of Parliament in 1821 - and this can be seen as one of the early skirmishes in the approach to the 1832 reforms. You could also argue that East Retford was a disenfranchisement of sorts - in 1830 the existing tiny borough was reformed to represent the local area as a more conventional rural constituency. There had previously been moves to disenfranchise Stockbridge (1689, 1694) and Hindon (1701), but these did not get through Parliament. The 1701 election was sufficiently corrupt that it sparked a few general reform proposals along the lines of the 1830s legislation, but, again, these didn't get anywhere. 

I am not going to try and answer for the earlier periods (at least not just now - writing this from the train...) Prior to the Reform Acts, properly contested elections were of course less common. By the nineteenth century, the general system was that each voter had two votes. They could vote for any two of the candidates. A voter could also "plump", vote for only one candidate (counting as a single vote). There was not an official 'slate', but by the post-Reform period a contested election would usually be contested by two members of each party, and those affiliations were known. The two candidates with the most votes won seats. Split returns - say one Conservative, one Liberal - were thus possible. Interestingly, as the secret ballot didn't appear until later in the century, quite a few poll books survive - you can thus examine how many people voted a split ballot versus a straight one. I'll edit this when I can find a link. 

An enlisted Naval serviceman was paid anything from $80 to $213/month, depending on rank and service. I can't find a clear US record, but the Canadians had the lowest (non-training) telegraphist grade as an Able Seaman, and this seems to be at the E-3 level; so by analogy say $100/month. To make it directly comparable to civilian pay we need to account for board and lodging; where the Navy didn't provide these our E-3 would get an allowance of $45 (lodging) and $2.25/day (food) - so say $112.50 allowance, for a total of $212.50. This report will contain more information than you could possibly want on wages by grade & year for Western Union employees, including discussion of the major pay discussions. Based on Table 2a, a mid-range morse telegraphist could expect $1.24/hour in 1948, $1.41 in 1951, and $1.54-1.69 by 1953. As an aside, it's worth bearing in mind that unionisation in the industry seems to have begun well before the 1950s (there's some fairly extensive discussion here), so the postwar activity won't reflect the improvement over an entirely non-unionised starting point. So, how do they compare? In the Navy, assuming he had to find his own bed and board, he'd get $212.50, plus $9 sea pay if applicable, and a further $45 hazardous-duty pay if he did submarine or aviation duty. Or, he could go into civilian work and get about $230/month (five days a week for eight hours at a time), more with overtime or longer hours (not sure if a five, six, or five-and-a-half-day week was standard then). Civilian pay looks a bit better, but not overwhelmingly so. 

For moving images, the answer seems to be probably Pope Leo XIII (born 1810, filmed 1898), with the tantalizing suggestion that Vasily Goncharov's film 1812 (made 1912) contained two people aged over 110. This is possible, but seems very unlikely - people of this age have been recorded, but very rarely. 

edit: we can, though, demonstrate it isn't just a copy of the 1790 census that's been misattributed as 1785. This 1785 list has Ferrisburgh, Addison County. This page has the 1790 census transcription. It's noticeable that the 1790 one is missing several names (eg Bingham, Brush) that are present on the "1785" one. This strongly suggests it was from a different period, and the fact it has 29 households rather than 80 in the 1790 document suggests it was earlier (though it's always possible it's later and fragmented for some reason). This does feel consistent with it being actually circa 1785, though. 

In other words, the vast majority of votes went either for the challenger or for the incumbent(s). Aylesbury, 1831 general election Aylesbury had three candidates, two votes. Nugent and Rickford were both incumbent reformists, opposed by a single candidate, who "professed to approve the principle but to object to many of the details of the reform bill, and declared his support for the constitution in church and state and for the agricultural interest" - so a bit more Tory-leaning. The voting patterns are described at length by the History of Parliament: 

For an image, the canonical photo is this one (IWM Q.11745), and you could do a lot worse than reuse it. 

To an expedition planner at the time Amundsen and Scott were setting out, there was a reasonably clear route through from the Ross Sea, with fairly well-understood sea ice conditions, sites for a base camp, etc. On the other side, there was a sighting of a rocky coastline, an unexplored hinterland, and very heavy ice to get there. With the information available at that time, the Weddell approach wouldn't seem to offer any benefits over any other sector of coastline. 

My suspicion is that these are from some form of electoral roll or tax register, not a census proper - as noted, there's no obvious evidence of a 1785 census. There was, however, a "Grand List" of some kind at the time, which survives today as the system for Vermont property tax. There is an example 1781 Grand List for Poulteney reproduced here, and it simply listed names and rateable value of the land. They seem to have been a normal and widespread tool throughout Vermont at the time; from the proposed October 1785 Constitution, chapter II section VII, p. 47 here: 

So, the most important thing to bear in mind about the "Christmas Truce" was that it was not a single event. Truces broke out independently at many different locations - they shared many common characteristics and in some cases the participants may have been aware of truces elsewhere, but in general, you're looking at a lot of independent activity more-or-less invented on the spot. There is a good scholarly survey of different aspects of this in Meeting in No Man's Land: Christmas 1914 and Fraternization in the Great War (ed. Malcolm Brown, 2007). I haven't yet read The Christmas Truce: Myth, Memory, and the First World War (Terri Blom Crocker, 2015) but it looks solid as well. The second most important thing is that it wasn't just on Christmas - although that was the highest-profile bit and one of the few explicitly talked-about ones. Localised truces occurred right throughout the war, though as time went on, they were more commonly tacit rather than explicit - think "oh, we never shoot when they're washing" - Trench Warfare 1914â€“1918: the live-and-let-live system (Tony Ashworth, 1980) is an excellent survey of this. I cannot recommend the Ashworth book strongly enough - really eye-opening and worth reading for anyone with an interest in the lived experience of WWI. Hopefully you've picked these up from background reading, but if not, never hurts to set the groundwork :-) As a result, there wasn't a very clear geographic focus, and single events that characterised some truces (eg football, songs, burial, souvenir exchanges) were not present at others. This probably helped the growing belief in the late 20th century that it was a myth, as various accounts of it contradicted others, or came from different places, etc. For a series of eyewitness accounts to pick from, the first chapter of Brown 2007 or one of the recent popular histories like Silent Night: The Story of the World War I Christmas truce (Stanley Weintraub, 2001) are pretty good. (Weintraub has some interesting comments of the truce as experienced by Indian units, I think, though I can't find a copy to hand). One of the most widely-used accounts is from RJ Ames, an officer in the (British) 1st Staffordshires, and something like this would work well - 

It feels like there's a reasonable chance names will be listed there, or at the very least some form of clear indication of whether sailors as well as soldiers were captured and identified. No guarantees, of course, but it's a start. Another potentially useful resource is WO 90, "registers from the Judge Advocate General's Office of general courts martial confirmed abroad from the end of the eighteenth century", but this is several volumes long and there does not appear to be an index to it. Again, though, you'll have to get someone to do the copying for you; it's not yet digitised. Paying for an entire volume on spec is going to be expensive; going yourself (if in the UK) or commissioning a researcher might be cheaper. 

It's also possible that we're chasing a red herring by looking at War Office court-martial records. The services were very demarcated in those days, to the point of answering to different ministries, and it's quite plausible that the Army wouldn't have wanted to try a sailor (or a marine?) even had they caught an admitted deserter. He might have been slung in the back of a cart and handed over to more appropriate authorities as and when convenient - which means he might appear in the Admiralty court-martial records. In that case, ADM 12/27F seems to be an "Index and digest of court martial verdicts", 1812-1855; there are also two "Index and Register of Courts Martial", ADM 13/103 (1803-1856) and ADM 13/104 (1812-1856). It seems likely that if court-martialled by the Navy, he would be named in there. Once you've found an index entry, more detailed papers appear to be stored on a monthly basis in ADM 1 - eg/ ADM 1/5429 covers August 1812. But until you know what month it happened, looking in these might not be very productive. It's worth noting that there were no individual records for ratings in those days; if you knew what ship he deserted from, you could look at its records and see if he's named. But with only a rough date and potentially any ship which called in North America in that timeframe, this is certainly a dead end. 

Picking up on the theme of National Archives War Office records, you might have some luck with WO 28/304, "General Orders issued on behalf of the Commander of the Forces in Canada [Lieutenant General Sir George Prevost] by the Adjutant General's Office at the headquarters in Quebec.", covering 20 February to 18 October 1812. WO 28/303 (similar records from a slightly different department) goes up to 25 August 1812, which probably means it won't contain what you're after, but there's a slim possibility it'd be useful. 

The Wikipedia article on UK trade union history is fairly useful here. The Luddite movements of the early nineteenth century took place at a time when trade unions were effectively illegal. After they gained some limited legal protections in the 1820s, unions grew in size and strength, but by the late nineteenth century they were dominated by skilled workers and much less common among unskilled or semi-skilled labour - the groups probably most in need of union protection. The match-girls strike was an early part of the "new unionism" movement of the late 1880s, which organised unskilled and semi-skilled workers into unions. That movement led to the modern trade unions, which work on a national scale, across whole industries or sectors, and recruit from the whole workforce in that area rather than just small craft groups. 

General answer: it will probably depend what you define as "the shape". Ultimately, once landfall was made on opposite coasts (1820-1840), and land was proven to be there, it was a matter of looking at all the places a ship had sailed through without hitting anything, concluding that the coastline must be further south than that, and drawing in a dotted line to taste. As Antarctica is basically circular, this worked out pretty well - the inferred coastline was broadly similar to what was actually there. As successive expeditions reached new stretches of the coastline, the estimates were refined and the known bits were drawn in, until by the late-1940s early-1950s the whole coastline was charted. Map as of 1911, for example: (source; more examples). Note that this is basically correct in its outline save for the spurious "second peninsula" in the Weddell Sea (no idea why that got in there) and a certain ambiguity as to whether Graham Land connected to the mainland or not. 

So it looks like the local authorities were given power to define the dates on which someone ceased to be of compulsory school age, in much the same way as they could set term dates, and there was no fixed rule. I haven't been able to find any of these announcements in the Belfast Gazette (though I may not have been looking for the right keywords...) The limit of fifteen was postponed for a few years (it remained at fourteen until at least 1951), and was later raised to sixteen in 1972 (announcement). 

This 1770s map appears to show the border running along the ridge line, as in your 1869 example, suggesting that if there was any change it was relatively short-lived. Given this, I wonder if the 1859 line may simply be a cartographical error... 

Depends on the exact weight - a half-ounce letter would be 2 1/2d, a one-ounce letter 4d. (Postcards were 1d until 1921). There were standard definitive stamps for 2 1/2d and 4d (blue and grey respectively) so it is likely these would have been used, but a combination of smaller ones might have been used if they were to hand. 

So, unlike Westmoreland, there were very few purely "challenger" votes, with many of his supporters choosing to split their ballots and vote for one of the incumbents as well. A very different dynamic. Hull, 1832 & 1835 general elections, 1835 by-election In Hull, the poll books are a bit more confusing. They only list a single name (well, initial) against each person. But each elector seemed to have two votes - there were 3730 cast in 1826 against only 2298 electors - so I'm not sure quite what's being done here. 

Skimming the German discussion, it seems the winner there was Hannah Stilley Gorbey, an elderly American lady photographed circa 1840, born 1746. There is also this image of one Baltus Stone recorded as born 1747; not much information, but some more details here. It's quite possible that someone else slightly older was photographed, but unlikely you'd get back before about 1740 - this would put them at over 100 when the first daguerrotypes were being made. 

There is a list of tonnages by type and year (or rather by 'protocol period', July-June) here. It's very high-level, but it does at least let you show, for example, that food deliveries peaked in 1943-44 and dropped off the following year, replaced by railway equipment and petrol. Chart 6 here gives a rough year-by-year breakdown of numbers of aircraft, tanks, and other vehicles shipped in 1941-43, though sadly not after that. (It does suggest that the reports to Congress on lend-lease might have the specific numbers you're looking for) 

Thus the "grand list" was constructed in such a way that it could be used to apportion population between counties - doing so by number of households might have been a fair approximation to doing it by actual population. The county "census lists" linked here only name heads of houses, and this would fit well with someone going through such a list and taking down the names of all the property-holders. I strongly suspect that this is the source of what's being reported here as a "census", possibly with some of the details having been lost when transcriptions were passed from one person to another, but of course it's not really possible to prove that either way! 

**edit ** right, some pre-Reform c19th examples with poll books Westmoreland, 1818 general election Note that this is for Westmoreland voters in Appleby, not for the Appleby seat. It had three candidates, two incumbent brothers who were locally poweful Tories, and a Whig challenger. This was the first properly contested election for the seat in living memory. The challenger took about 27% of the votes cast, not a bad total, but - 

I have a copy (as yet unread) of Exploring and Mapping Alaska: the Russian American Era, 1741-1867, A. Postnikov & M. Falk, tr. L. Black, University of Alaska Press, 2015. There are a few pages dealing with Fort Ross, and the footnotes to these point to papers at AVPRI, RGIA, and RGAVMF. Respectively, these are the Archive of Russian Foreign Policy (Moscow), which seems to actually have (some of?) the Company papers; the Russian State Historical Archive (St. Petersburg); and the Russian State Naval Archives (St. Petersburg). I won't try and transcribe these as I don't know enough to give accurate context, but if you haven't yet come across the book, might be worth tracking down a copy and going through the citations.
