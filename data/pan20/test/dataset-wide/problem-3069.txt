In my experience, as a general rule, local historians tend to be superior to foreign historians. The reasons for this are that local historians generally tend to be a lot more detailed about their local history and they often have access to local data sources which are unavailable to a foreign scholar. Whenever I go to Europe I am always amazed by how incredibly detailed some local histories are. For example, I went to the ancient city of Korcula and it is filled with archives and documents about its history which can only be found there. Of course, there are plenty of exceptions, but in my opinion you should always begin with the local histories as a starting point. 

Proclamation Defining Terms for Japanese Surrender Issued, at Potsdam, July 26, 1945 By The United States, England and China Surrender or the US, British Empire, and China will use the "full application of our military power" to deliver the "utter devastation of the Japanese homeland." Is that clear enough? Minimizing casualties was not on the list of objectives. 

This sword, from the Higgins Armory, is inscribed with a short encomium on justice on the obverse (the reverse is shown in the photo). When sharpened, such a sword will make a clean cut and due to its weight will go right through bone no problem. The skill is in swinging it so that it hits exactly the right place. If you have any doubts as to the difficulty of this, simply get a 3-foot long 2x4 and plant it end-wise into the ground. Then take a 1/2" steel rod and try to hit it solidly lengh-wise. You will soon see it takes quite a lot of practice to do such a thing consistently. 

The division of Rome by the second triumvirate was into more than the three parts assigned to Octavian, Antony and Lepidus. For example, all of Italy was assigned to the Senate as you can see in the following map: 

It's not a question of "accurate shooting", it's a question of becoming expert in the use and maintenance of a crossbow and connection to an industrial culture for making and repairing them. Real crossbows are quite sophisticated devices and in their time were very expensive. The mercenary corps of crossbowmen were relatively wealthy soldiers who invested time and money developing themselves as elite soldiers with elite equipment. Your question is kind of like, why is Seal Team Six so elite? All you have to do to fire a machine gun is pull the trigger. There is more to being a soldier than just standing in a field and pulling a trigger. 

America supported the crown of France, the Bourbons, who had provided them huge amounts of money and other support during the American Revolution. When the French revolutionaries deposed and executed the King of France, the United States refused paying any debts to France on the grounds that the money had been lent by the King and only would we repay the King. Because of this the French Republicans attacked the United States on the high seas, causing a brief war, called the Quasi War. 

Apple trees and fruit trees and vines in general do not grow well in England because it is too cold and wet and the soils are unfavorable. While there may be a few fruit trees in England, they are in relatively short supply and fruit and its produce has not (since Roman times) been an important part of the British diet, which is best known for "bangers and mashed", boiled beef, crackers and other similar items. Most apple cultivars in England are not English at all, but are French cultivars which is why they have French names like "pippin" and "ruffet". France has a far superior climate for fruit trees and vines. Just as one evidence of this go to a wine store and look for the "British" wine section. Then compare that to the French wine section. As a comment on the superiority of the American climate and soil for fruit trees I could cite Peter Williamson's treatise on the geography of New England (1759): 

It is USS LSIL-545. It got two battle commendations. Here is that baby in action in New Guinea (what a hell hole): 

Thus any woman could escape being an automatic wife by claiming she slept for three nights outside of the house. Note that any usus wife, contract or not, would be considered materfamilias (primary wife) by the law if she was the only wife of a man. 

Not in the way you would think. The Romans did not use furniture unless they were very rich. Even items like the curule chair which magistrates used were very simple with only a small amount of wood. Of course, desks did exist for secretaries to the emperor and people like that, but a modern desk would have been very expensive in Roman times. Ordinary students would just use a tablet to write. A professional scribe might use a small table and be seated on the ground or a short stool as follows: 

I did not watch the movie on the linked web site, so I have no idea what the exact claims are, but I will comment on the alleged "economic miracle" of Nazi Germany from a historical point of view: At the time the economic events in Germany were popularly considered an economic rejuvenation and Hitler was credited with restoring the economy of Germany. American newspapers of the time, especially socialist papers, had one article after another praising the nationalizing effect of the Nazis. For example, the government would take over a private mine, reduce the hours of the workers, subsidize the mine, plant flowers outside the buildings and such things were publicized as an "economic miracle" and "workers paradise" where the "people" benefitted instead of a few rich owners. The Nazi state crushed Germany's private auto industry and centralized it, creating "Volkswagen", the "people's car" that everyone could afford, not just the rich. American newspapers made a big deal of how the United States was "forgiving" the World War I reparation payments and how this going to be a big win-win for the world economy. The Nazis instituted all kinds of make-work projects to "employ" young men on city-year type projects and then trumpeted how they had "full employment". In short, everything was done to give an appearance of huge economic success. In the background, however, and unknown to the public, these superficially beautiful economics had a rotten core. By destroying small businesses and nationalizing everything the Nazi's economic foundation was quicksand. Sure, they could make poster-child successes like Volkswagen with secret subsidies, but the reality was people, rich or poor, were driving fewer cars than ever. Much of the Nazi's glowing "industrial successes" were financed by monetary tricks and large, secret debts originated in Switzerland, in addition to huge internal debts (like Social Security). The Nazis were boasting how they were feeding all the poor old people, but then hiding how they were financing such "successes". By 1936 on the surface everything was "fantastic", what a huge success, everyone is employed, no more starvation, industry is booming, we are building a highway network unparalleled in the world that will create a new golden age of commerce! It was easy to make it look good in the newspapers. A few wise observers noticed the true reality: secret work gangs were ripping up park benches and railings in Berlin to salvage them for scrap metal, state bankers were taking ever more frequent trips to Switzerland, rationing of critical goods like butter and meat was introduced (1936). If your economy is so good, why are you rationing? The definitive book to read about this is Adam Tooze's Wages of Destruction: The Making and Breaking of the Nazi Economy. 

The US equivalent is the Flash rocket launcher. American forces rarely use the Flash due to the high probability of civilian casualties if the weapon is used in an urban environment. Modern military soldiers also have access to incendiary grenades which can be used to ignite flammable materials. These weapons can be effective against pillboxes or other positions which have a limited field of view. Normally such positions are no longer tactically relevant because modern artillery and rockets are so accurate and powerful that pillboxes can be destroyed from a long range. 

Most bombing by both the RAF and USAAF was partially or fully unescorted. Early in the war, virtually all long-distance bombing raids took place at night to avoid the possibility of interception. The Germans used searchlights and AA guns to try to combat this. Later in the war they developed night fighters. The United States eventually perfected daytime, high-altitude bombing. This required aircraft with oxygen supplies and masks, as well as a very sophisticated bomb sight. The diagram below shows the evolving range of possible escort during the war: 

The Communist army did not oppose the Japanese in any meaningful way. One report they sent to Stalin listed casualties as 97% KMT and 3% 8th Route Army. Also, the Communists had no heavy weapons so they could not fight in the field anyway and simply had to retreat. Much of the fighting with the Communists was not even done by regular soldiers, but by Japanese police, or their Chinese allies. The Maoists called these Chinese forces "Japanese puppets". One of the larger of these armies was called the "Grand Han Righteous Army" which fought some police actions against the Maoists. It may true that the Communists were more "disciplined", but such things are hard to judge, especially when you are talking about a guerilla force that is spending most of its time hiding. Obviously, if the Japanese did not even deign to fight the Communists themselves and just sent their "puppets" and civilian police, it would suggest they did not consider the Communists to be a serious problem.
