What it means is that you are not eliminated from consideration and he feels you are a strong candidate. He is interviewing more because he has interviews scheduled and some of them might be better candidates than you are. It is very rare for a company to find someone they like and then cancel all existing scheduled interviews. 

Pulling less weight is entirely subjective. First, he may be doing more than you think (there are other things besides code check-in that contribute to a project). Next he may be less skilled and thus have lower expectations from management and be assigned to those crappy tasks nobody else wants to do but still need to be done. Third why do you care if he gets credit if he worked on the project too? It is none of your business. Fourth maybe no one has the time to mentor him in the middle of meeting a tight deadline. Fifth, he may have something else that is causing him to be delayed in what he is doing that is outside of his control. Or he may be doing less due to a personal problem (like say a cancer diagnosis) and less repsponsibility is something worked out with the manager which would likely remain confidential and you would not be told. Nor are you aware necessarily of what management may be doing to improve his performance if there is a real performance problem. It takes time to get rid of someone and in a crunch management may make the choice that the small contribution is better than the no contribution they would get if they fired the guy because they couldn't get someone new in to replace him in time. Of course, management may love him because he is taking the credit for what other people do because he is competent at office politics and the rest of the team is not. Or maybe he is there for a reason you can't get past like being the son of the CEO's college roommate. People like that know they don't have to pull their weight and why shoudl they waste the energy? So what do you do? First if there is a genuine performance problem, you need to bring it up sooner rather than later. If his slowness or inability to produce is causing delays for others, then bring up the delay (not his performance specifically) and ask management to get him some help so that your work is not affected. You say managemnt doesn't know he is not pulling his weight. Well why don't they know? Did you and your team mates forget to mention the problems he is causing? If he is not causing any problems or delays why do you care that he only produced one module for the the ten you did. If the problem is that he doesn't work the same crazy hours you work, then examine just why you think you have to work those hours. If the problem is that you just don't like him, the problem could be your attitude. Does he have trouble getting cooperation from others on the team? And what have you done to try to help him improve? Have you mentored him? Have you even asked him if he needs help or what the problem is? Have you suggested things like code review for everyone as a way to get his skills up to snuff? If management sits in on these code reviews and everyone else does well and his stuff always fails, they wil realizxe soon enough how poorly he is performing. If you point out the problems with his code then he can learn better constructs and imporve his performance. And if it doesn't get better that too will become obvious to everyone and steps to get rid of him can be taken. And as for the political side, people can't take credit for your work when you already have. No one in the work world can afford to not understand or play office politics. You are in the game whether you want to be or not and not trying to play gives the creeps an easy target for the credit grabbing game. Why would you want to give an easy win to a snake? And if the politics dictate he will be there no matter what, then make friends with the guy and get him to push for you instead of being his enemy. And if he is just too lazy to do his job, then a few pointed remarks where a manager can hear about checking Facebook or playing games while such and such is already late can work wonders. Peer pressure often will keep these people in line and if it doesn't, then ask management directly to get rid of him after you have proof that he is is not pulling his weight. Someone who won't improve after code reviews and peer pressure and being talked to directly and having his delays aired in meetings is someone who can't be fixed and needs to go. But sometimes management won't hear that until the most respected memeber of the team points out the morale issue of keeping such a person. Because managers are people too and it isn't fun to fire people. But finding out that your other team members are negatively affected especially to the point of leaving can be the deal breaker. If someone is leaving, ask them to mention the problem in their exit interview. 

All of us occasionally end up missing meetings. As you get higher in organizations, you will find yourself missing meetings because the meeting from the hour before didn't end. The best way to handle meetings you can't attend is to send an email to the organizer before the meeting if you find out that you won't be able to make it. But sometimes you can't do that becasue you are stuck in traffic or you didn't see the meeting reminder while you were concentrating on something else. It is rude to ignore the meeting and the meeting organizer will likely be annoyed anyway that you didn't show up. So apologizing at least acknowledges that you realize you missed the meeting and gives you a chance to ask what you missed and if any tasks were assigned to you (we love to assign items to the people who don't show up!). PLus you personally as an intern need to learn that an apology is not sufficent if the behavior doesn't change after. So if you miss a meeting because you were late to work, you had better not let that happen repeatedly. Don't be that person who blows off every task he doesn't want to do (like attend meetings) or shows up late repeatedly. You may have some flexibility in the time to get to work but that flexibility does not include getting there too late for a scheduled meeting that you knew about in advance. 

As a supervisor you need to address such issues even if they are painful. Other people will notice him ignoring you and lose respect for you. If he is angry about something, then failing to address it right away will make it worse. If he is having a personal problem, then he needs to be aware of is being noticed that it is affecting the workplace. Sometimes the first step is ignoring someone, then it escalates to refusing to do tasks assigned or bad mouthing the person to others. Ignoring your supervisor is almost always something bad in the workplace. It causes ripples that can affect your ability to supervise the rest of the staff. So you need to have a discussion with this person about the behavior and what is causing it. You also need to make your expectations of work behavior clear especially if he chooses to not tell you about the cause. Remember attitude is part of his job performance, he needs to know that you expect politeness. 

My main concerns would be: From an organizational standpoint, changing to this structure could be incredibly disruptive of current projects. (I've seen this happen at least twice and clients were very unhappy.) Is there any gain which could offset this disruption? This type of change would affect deadlines, would affect ability to deliver the product (some people are bound to end up on projects they are not very familair with) because of having to learn the new project. It is also incredibly risky as some things might get lost in the shuffle as people currently assigned to do them move to other projects. What would be the plan? Is there a way to do a phased change? If there is less cross-pollination, will you be in trouble if someone key on a project takes another job? Developers tend to move around. Having fewer people know the details of projects could be costly. If we are talking project teams of 5-10 that might not be an issue, but if the teams end up as 1-2 on a particular project it could be. If you silo people into specific product lines, are you limiting their ability to gain new knowledge (a must have for most good programmers) and thus pretty much forcing the best ones to leave to keep up their professional qualifications? The more projects you have using older technology, the worse this could be. How easy will it be to transfer to other projects? Once you get to be expert in one project, the chances of moving around become much reduced. So if devs feel you are hurting their career paths, they will leave in droves and you will lose alot of the current knowledge. At the very least you will need a plan to allow transfers to other projects and a way to get past the "I can't give him up because he is the only one who knows..." issues. Career progression is important, the more project specialized people are the harder it is to move up as well. You need a plan to handle it. You might consider moving 5-10% of the developers each year and making it a requirement that everyone has to be allowed to change product lines at least once every 5 years. This could help force the cross pollination, give people a chance to get new types of experience and keep the bulk of the team relatively stable. The ramp up time should be figured into the project plans because you know you will get some new developers every year. It would also help keep managers from relying too much on one person as they know he will evenetually be transferred. You might also make sure people can apply for new openings without having to have approval of their current boss (to prevent people hoarding). I would ask your boss what he expects to gain that would offset the possible problems (I'm sure that being in the current situation you can think of more than I could. You can also probably see what the benefits might be.) You also need to consider that you might have specialists who need to remain cross-functional no matter what. Or were you going to hire 7 business intelligence specialists (1 per projet) instead of the 2 you have (as an example). The best bet might be to do a hybrid organization where some are siloed and some are not. You could even do a cost-benefit analysis that quantifies the risks and rewards of both possibilities so that he can see what the impact would be. 

For the future, your first mistake was in allowing this happen because you were new. You totally gave away any authority/influence you have. It is harder to get it back after you give it away. Next, the first problem is not the subordinate, but your boss. He is the only one who can salvage this at this point. He should never have allowed the person to go around you. So the first thing you do is go to your boss and have a heart-to-heart. Tell him that in allowing this person to bypass you, he is making it more difficult for you to manage this person. Ask your boss to please send this person back to you anytime he directly contacts your boss, no exceptions. Then ask your boss to help you get better at answering questions by providing you the information he would have given the employee in a separate email. That way you will have the information when the employee goes to you and you will start to build the knowledge that you need to be effective in this organization. Part of the political dynamic going on here is that he is prossibly upset at not being chosen for your position (or at a friend not being chosen if he didn't apply). You said it was open internally and they did not hire anyone. Talk to your boss about whether this person was interested in the job and if so, why he was not chosen. Ask what prevented them from hiring internally. You can't fix a problem until you know what the problem is. If he wanted and got turned down for the position or if he thought someone else internally should have gotten the postion, he may very well be deliberately trying to make you look bad in which case the moves are different than if he is genuinely doing this to speed of the process from his perspective. Think how you would feel if you had worked somewhere a long time and someone from outside was brought in with no knowledge of the systems and made your boss. Even if you had not applied for the job, you would likley resent working for someone with less knowledge than you have. That's just how human nature is. So part of the challenge is that you have to get this guy on your side (and the rest of your team as well), because he is someone respected in the organization and whose opinion of you matters a great deal. This means you need to talk to him. You need to completely hear him out without being defensive. You need to ask him what he needs from you. You need to find out why he is going around you and how you can fix that. You need to know whether he wants to be promoted and, if so, to what postion. You need to know his background and you need to make sure that he clearly understands that you respect his professional abilities (even if his attitude leaves something to be desired.). You need to find out, in short, what needs to change and how you can help turn this guy's opinion of you around. You may hear some unpleasant things when you ask. It is cricial to not get defensive and to think after the meeting about whther there is any validity in what he says. You should probably have this conversation with others on your team as well. If they all say the same thing, it is very possible that they perceive the problem to be you. You may need to make some changes in how you manage them. I don't know you and I don't know them, so it is hard to say if this will happen. It is more of a warning that it could and to be mentally and emotionally prepared for it to happen before you start having such conversations. Remember if he says something you don't like, the worst possible move to make is to get angry. He has the respect of this organization and you have not yet built that same level of respect. In any angry confrontation, the organization is likely to come down on his side. Now as far as the employee ignoring emails you send him, that has to stop. You need to tell him that when you ask for something, he needs to respond directly to you and that if you ask something, he needs to respond by the date in the email. You have to make your exceptations crystal clear. Now make sure any emails do have a respond by date in them and if he does not respond by that time, you go directly to his desk and ask him why he has not responded. I would do this is in a separate conversation only after trying talking to him about what his concerns areand talking to the boss about rerouting anything the employee sends him and seeing if that doesn't help change your relationship before you take this step. If after all this, he still won't change, then you need to discuss more serious steps with HR (you should be fully aware of what steps you need to take at this company with a perceived problem employee in any event). Truth is that while many people can be turned around when a relationship gets off on the wrong foot, some cannot.
