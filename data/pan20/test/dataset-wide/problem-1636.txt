A Case Study in Sincere Hypocrisy: Brigitte Gabriel claims that she defines a "radical muslim" as follows: 

The BBC reports that live births happen in practice A 2007 article titled One in 30 aborted foetuses lives says, 

There are allegations (which may be so self-evident as to need no proof) that the USDA is more concerned with "food safety" than with "humane killing". The US Government Accountability Office (which reports to Congress) wrote a document in 2010 titled HUMANE METHODS OF SLAUGHTER ACT: Actions Are Needed to Strengthen Enforcement. The GAO report things like: 

Pages 80 through 90 of ibid say that some people claim there was forced conversion (by force or by punitive taxation), but that this is contemporary bias for which there is no historical evidence. On page 108 it repeats the quote from the Chachnâmah about the tax ("48 dirhams of silver" etc.). Page 125 confirms it's reasonable to conclude that Buddhism (unlike Hinduism) died out in Sindh during the Arab rule (before the 9th century AD). Page 128 says that some Buddhist monks emigrated but it's unlikely that the whole Buddhism population (apart from monks) did: they may have converted to Hinduism but it's likely they converted to Islam. Page 5 through 9 explain what the Chachnâmah is. 

There are other sources on the web, such as Huffington Post, but ultimately they all seem to echo the same source from the Scotland Herald, and it wouldn't be the first time that a worldwide media buzz all echo an initially incorrect source. I want to disbelieve this. Is this really taught to schoolchildren in Louisiana? 

According to LeHigh University Brown and White, Volume 36, No. 41, Tuesday, March 11, 1975, Nader introduced a two-day “Symposium on Nuclear Power Development and Society” at Lafayette, where he said: 

A discussion paper published at the University of East Anglia holds that due to the cap-and-trade scheme, a decisions to fly or not has no impact inside the European Union. Quoting from the press release, Emissions trading schemes limit green consumerism: 

I'm going to list this as unclear. Among 7 recent incidents with fatalities I looked at in a bit of detail, 4 were islamist and probably 3 were non-islamist far-right. The details are sufficiently muddy that I supect that anyone can bend their criteria or definition or reporting period such as to make this claim either true or untrue. Details below. 

Yes. In fact, some sources calculate that the FAO figure is actually an underestimate. A frequently cited study on the topic is Steinfeld et al. (2006). This is the FAO study already mention in the question. It has 1503 citations on Google Scholar, although only 40 in the more conservative Scopus. I am not sure if it is peer-reviewed. To judge its quality, we could look at what other scientific studies have to say about it. To pick one, here it is summarised by Koneswaran et al. (2008): 

If I may say this without being rude, there's no proof of "a whole nation witnessing a miracle" in the Jewish tradition: instead, what you have is a whole nation who insist that their ancestors saw a miracle. IMO this could be analogous to the foundation myths/miracles which accompany the foundation of other nations or cities: which include gods doing battle, granting gifts and patronage, etc. Whether "everyone believed" is a bit off-topic on skeptics: because personal beliefs are unknowable. From what I remember being told of history, it was the State religion. If people were executed for non-compliance, then yes it probably was "the whole nation" that "believed" it. Statements on Wikipedia such as: Imperial cult 

I found it interesting to compare Benedict's statement quoted above, with the following paragraph from Humanis Generis from Pope Pius XII in 1950 (emphases are mine): 

In contrast the "Cost-Utility Analysis" document (referenced above) argues from the point of view of "cost effectiveness": how much does it cost (to provide immunizations), compared with how many lives are saved, and how much healthcare costs (e.g. from visiting doctors after you catch the flu) are reduced. The conclusion says that targeted immunization of high-risk populations have been proven worthwhile: 

See also this article in The Independent which discusses the Goodland and Anhang paper. A further study is by Garnett (2011) (emphasis mine): 

The contents of the article appears to imply the cards transmit position information, although on closer inspection it seems the cards are merely used to check in to the school and school bus, which then sends position information. Considering that the article describes Alerts are sent to the school's GPS server, it appears the author does not know what GPS is. Thirdly, Chinese Seeworld Technology sells what they claim is a Wireless student card ID card GPS tracker. I am skeptical of the existence of such a technology small enough to fit on a card. Actual GPS tracking devices such as SPOT appear far too bulky to fit on an ID card, and even GPS receivers that use GSM or GPRS to transmit positioning information, such as this Mini Global GPS Tracker, needs (of course) batteries too bulky for an ID card. Is there such a thing as a GPS tracker that fits on an ID card, or are the sources I quote above all confused or tin foil hat bonkers? 

They can't both be true. Are illegal immigrants given a bus ticket to where they want to go? Or are they all deported? 

In Wikipedia I read that the first edition was published after his death: and so I wondered whether the first edition might be unreliable. Wikipedia says, 

Or this definition which says that by the 5th century the word means "témérité" (i.e. impertinence, audacity, cheek). That's similar to the second of Google's definitions of the English word, 

... (blue objects such as for example steel, and that first bit about the British is presumably about woad). The use of caeruleum is attributed to Caesar, Virgil, Ovid, Cicero, and Pliny, i.e. classical and not just medieval Latin. 

Anecdotes aren't worth as much as cohort studies; when you have 200,000+ people taking a drug there are going to be some scary stories. The cohort study says it's safe (at least regarding depression etc.) It's less dangerous than smoking 

In a comment, Fabian said, "A good answer should provide the laws and regulations involve, but also provide some evidence if those laws are not enforced properly." In summary: 

Induced labour without explicit feticide is sometimes practiced in Europe Europe's abortion rules says that "12 weeks" is the usual limit for most countries, but up to 24 weeks in the United Kingdom. How an abortion is carried out (by the NHS in the UK) says,

Other studies More recently, Séralini et. al (2012) conclude that a particular kind of genetically modified food is harmful to rats, but only on timescales similar to the rats lifetime, which would suggest that effects in humans may only become visible on a timescale of decades. The work by Séralini is highly controversial. He has been accused of fraud and his articles have been described as debunked; whether this is true or a sign of the debate itself being toxic, I don't know. Wikipedia has a whole article Séralini affair, which links further to himself and his articles. They're too controversial to base any conclusions upon, really. An advocacy group called Earth Open Source has published a report GMO Myths and Truths, where GMO is understood as genetically engineered crops. This document specifically collects material critical of GMO, and is therefore not objective by itself, but it does build upon peer-reviewed publications and the authors have PhDs in relevant fields (molecular genetics and biochemistry). They list a number of studies linking how GMO's can be toxic, similarly to the note by the Union of Concerned Scientists. Concluding note "Safe to consume" or "harmful to humans" can relate to direct or indirect effects. Not all GMO food is automatically unsafe, but there exist secondary effects. For example, some GMO adoption leads to increased pesticide use, and there exist ecological risks which can indirectly affect human health. For further reading, these issues are addressed by the Union of Concerned Scientists, the UNEP, and the Earth Open Source report. The scientific debate continues. 

In the comments to your question, you ask for percentages. The total electricity production for Europe is approximately 3,200 TWh: 

Here is a web page from The London School of Medicine and Dentistry, which I think is supposed to train medical students about risk, and which uses Champix as a case study: Champix It summarizes the "controversy", including individual anecdotes: 

Assuming you know already what the points/claims were in each category, my summary of the paper's analysis/refutation of each category is as follows: Obesity and Weight Loss: 

Bengal was only created 70 years ago and, given the arbitrariness of international borders, the fact that the Rohingya speak a different dialect isn't proof that they're a different "nationality", nor that they are recent illegal immigrants. IOW this may be a continuation of ethnic partitioning of which the partition of Bengal was one example, the partition of India another, the Bosnian war another, and so on -- see ethnic cleansing. Or from the Guardian: 

Apparently there's a lot to say on that subject, therefore I'll quote Wikipedia: because it summarizes. Genetics of race and intelligence ends with, 

In contrast, page 19 of this document from the NHS audit commission reports only about 1,200 deaths/year from medications in the UK. Allowing for the fact that UK population is 5 times less than that of the USA, I calculate from the above that the death rate due to medications is 18 times higher in the USA than the UK: either the rate of iatrogenic death is much higher than in the States, or there's something wrong or incompatible (not comparable) with the way in which cause-of-death is reported. 

Let's assume that he means every presidential election. Has every presidential election in U.S. history been won by the party with the most money to campaign? Edit: To make this question answerable, let's stick to elections recent enough where campaign financing is publicly available. 

Yes, Piff has compiled evidence of correlation between wealth/social class versus narcissism, entitlement, and unethical behaviour. Whether this evidence is convincing I leave to anyone studying the details of the research. Piff, Paul K. "Wealth and the Inflated Self Class, Entitlement, and Narcissism." Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin 40.1 (2014): 34-43. DOI: 10.1177/0146167213501699 In this paper, Piff describes a number of experiments based on questionnaires. Some of the studies recruited participants through the internet, whereas others used undergraduate students. In one experiment, controlling for factors like gender and ethnicity, he interviewed 195 adults on questions related to entitlement, and questions related to social class. He correlated the two, and found that As predicted, higher social class was associated with increased scores on the PES, r(178) = .17,p = .021. In another study, he correlated question related to entitlement to objective measures on social class, such as parental education. Here, he found that Central to my hypothesis, parental educational attainment—an objective indicator of social class—was positively associated with scores on the PES, r(93) = .22, p = .036. Three more studies are also described in the paper. In the conclusions, he posits further research is needed to test his hypothesis it is relative and not absolute wealth that controls entitlement and narcissism. In another paper, Piff, Paul K., Daniel M. Stancato, Stéphane Côté, Rodolfo Mendoza-Denton, and Dacher Keltner. "Higher social class predicts increased unethical behavior." Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 109, no. 11 (2012): 4086-4091., the abstract summarises: 

The principle authority, whose writings are being cited in the OP, seems to be "Dr William Davis". I found a paper titled Wheat Belly—An Analysis of Selected Statements and Basic Theses from the Book which appears to analyze all of Dr Davis' points against wheat. Note: 

This Wikipedia article summarizes Assange's pleadings in UK courts. The courts ruled against Assange, even at the Supreme Court level when the cause was appealed. 

In July 2014 the CBC reported, Vapourizing marijuana is gaining momentum as a safer alternative to smoking it, says a Canadian doctor. ... One vapourizer is currently approved by Health Canada ... The device costs roughly $600. 

I don't see any claim that British radar wasn't vital, so I won't answer that. And Watson-Watt did invent /a/ radar device, and got a patent on it. However, clearly what he invented was a particular implementation of a radar device (and not, the concept of radar, nor even the first practical implementation of it). 

Page 41 of the referenced study/document does claim that, per its projections/algorithms, Sweden's HDI will drop, from 0.949 to 0.906 (e.g. to 45th place). 45th place is relatively low-ish (for comparison, currently Portugal is in about 45th place) but not "third world" ... the absolute HDI is still above 0.9 ... part of the reason why it's projected to be relatively low is that HDI of other countries are expected to rise. My initial answer was as follows: The document talks about how it calculates but doesn't explain it well/clearly enough for me to understand. The document doesn't include the actual calculations for Sweden, only the result of the calculations. However I think I understand it now, as follows. The start of the document says, 

The aforementioned blog article on climaterocks.com summarises the story from a Tea Party-critical perspective, whereas the Fox News article (perhaps unsurprisingly) has some focus on defending the claim that the Tea Party, is, in fact, a grassroots movement. This is not the first time the claim is being made. From this Paul Krugman column, New York Times, 13 April 2009: 

References within that article contain many more medical explanations for perceived out-of-body experiences. Whether there has been a person called Mary Ann Schinfield is difficult to determine. However, the claims about this person are incredibly unlikely to be true. 

This sounds just a little bit too much like the classic Weapons of Mass Instruction / Al-Gebra joke. Has this event in Lousiana actually happened, or is this satire that got picked up and spread as if it had really happened? 

Is this claim correct? Is there any reasonable interpretation of the legislative changes made by the Canadian Conservative government, through which these numbers are accurate? 

This study thus did observe a correlation. However, remember that correlation does not imply causation. Critically, the paper does no attempt to suggest any physical mechanism that may cause the observed correlation. Therefore, causation is not established. I lack the medical domain expertise to otherwise judge the merits of the paper, but Scientific Reports is a reputable journal published by the Nature group, so there should be some peer review that filters out the junk (and the paper does not appear to be junk). Note that Scientific Reports should not be confused with the actual journal Nature, which is much more prestiguous and harder to get into. Finally, I will quote an insightful comment by MB made on the actual article:
