As there is no precision about the dimension or about the field, I will try to give a description in some cases. There are plenty of other nice results about cubics. 1) Dimension 1: A smooth non-singular projective cubic curve is not rational. This is because the arithmetic genus, which is $g=(d-1)(d-2)/2=1$ is not equal to $0$. If you work over the complex field, you can see the points of your curve as a smooth surface definer over $\mathbb{R}$, and see that it is a torus, and not a sphere. You can also see it by computing the canonical divisor, which is trivial by adjunction. 2) Dimension 2: A smooth non-singular projective surface over an algebraic closed is rational. First you have to show that the surfaces contains at least two disjoint lines $L_1$, $L_2$. Then, you construct a map from $L_1\times L_2$ to your surface: to any general pair of points $(p_1,p_2)$, with $p_i\in L_i$ you associate the unique point $q$ in your surface such that $p_1,p_2,q$ are collinear. 3) Dimension 2 over a non-algebraically closed field: in general, the cubic is not rational. A simple reason could be that there is no point defined over your field. But even with a point, you can only get unirationality but not rationality. There are plenty of ways to study these cubics surfaces, for example with birational geometry (articles of Iskovkikh, Manin for example). 4) Dimension 3: a general smooth cubic threefold is not rational. This is much more complicate, but very interesting and comes from the intermediate Jacobian, see "The Intermediate Jacobian of the cubic threefold" by Clemens and Griffiths (Annals of Mathematics 1972). 5) Dimension >3: the question is open. There are plenty of rational smooth cubics but a general one should not be rational. 

The answer is yes. And more generally, one has the following result: Lemma: for any elliptic curve $X$, the degree of injective morphisms $X\to \mathbb{P}^2_{\mathbb{C}}$ (or $\mathbb{C}P^2$ if you want) is not bounded. Proof: The curve $X$ is isomorphic to a plane cubic of equation $X^3+Y^3+Z^3=\lambda XYZ$ for some $\lambda$ (Hessian form). Then, the curve has nine inflexion points. These are points $[0:1:\omega]$, $[1:0:\omega]$, $[1:\omega:0]$ with $\omega^3=1$. Choose three of them, $p_1,p_2,p_3$ such that the three corresponding tangent lines $L_1,L_2,L_3$ intersect at three points $L_1\cap L_2$, $L_1\cap L_3$, $L_2\cap L_3$, different from $p_1,p_2,p_3$. We change the coordinates and assume that $L_1,L_2,L_3$ are the lines $x=0$, $y=0$ and $z=0$. The points $p_1,p_2,p_3$ become points of the form $[0:1:a_1]$, $[a_2:0:1]$, $[1:a_3:0]$ with $a_1a_2a_3\not=0$. Take now the birational map of $\mathbb{P}^2$ given locally by $(x,y)-->(x,x^ny)$, and globally by $[x:y:z]-->[xz^n:x^ny:z^{n+1}]$, for $n\ge 2$. Its base-points are $[0:1:0]$ and $[1:0:0]$, which do not belong to the curve. The curves contracted are $z=0$ and $x=0$, and $y=0$ is fixed. Outside of the triangle $xyz=0$, the map is an automorphism. In consequence, the image of the curve has degree $3n$ and only cuspidal singularities. This yields an injective map from $X$ to $\mathbb{P}^2$. 

Up to automorphisms, the map $\mathbb{P}^2\to \mathbb{P}^1\times \mathbb{P}^1$ is in fact given by $(x:y:z)\mapsto ((x:y)(x:z))$, one easily sees that it blows-up $(0:0:1)$ and $(0:1:0)$ and that it contracts the line of equation $x=0$ onto the point $((0:1),(0:1))$. The inverse is $((a:b),(c:d))\to (ac:bc:ad)$, and it blows-up $((0:1),(0:1))$ and contracts the two lines $a=0$ and $c=0$ (passing through the point $((0:1),(0:1))$) onto $(0:0:1)$ and $(0:1:0)$. One funny other comment is that if you take the real sphere $S$ of dimension $2$ and take the stereographic projection, it gives a birational map $S\to \mathbb{R}^2$ which is not defined at the north pole (the point of the projection). Seeing $S$ in $\mathbb{P}^3$ as a a smooth quadric and putting $\mathbb{R}^2$ into the projective plane, we obtain a birational map $S\to \mathbb{P}^2$ which blows-up the point $q$ (north pole) and contract the two imaginary lines being the intersection of the quadric with the tangent plane at $q$. Over the reals, $S$ is not isomorphic to $\mathbb{P}^1\times \mathbb{P}^1$ (look at the topology of the real part) but extending to $\mathbb{C}$ it is, and the stereographic projection is exactly the inverse of the map you wanted (up to change of coordinates). 

There are plenty of other examples of birational involutions of $\mathbb{P}^3$ which are known. For the moment, no precise classification as in dimension $2$. However, the following preprint of Yuri Prokhorov gives a first nice step toward a classification: Yuri Prokhorov, "On birational involutions of $\mathbb{P}^3$" $URL$ In dimension $2$, we can say if two involutions are conjugate only by looking at fixed points. When the curves pointwise fix a curve of positive genus, the curve has to be the same (easy argument), but this condition is in fact sufficient (hard argument, only follows from classification). The same works for any order, looking carefully at the fixed points of all powers (see J. Blanc, "Elements and cyclic subgroups of finite order of the Cremona group." Comment. Math. Helv. 86 (2011), no. 2, 469-497, $URL$ In dimension $3$, we can have the same discussion, replacing fixed curves of positive genus with fixed surfaces which are not birationally ruled (other surfaces can be contracted by birational maps). The article of Yuri Prokhorov studies the case where such fixed surface exists. 

One other example: in characteristic $p>0$ there exist non trivial embeddings of the affine line $\mathbb{A}^1$ into the affine plane $\mathbb{A}^2$ (i.e. embeddings that are not equal to the composition of $x\mapsto (x,0)$ with an automorphism of $\mathbb{A}^2$). For example, $x\mapsto (x^{p^2},x^{p^2+p}+x)$ is an embbeding because $k[x^{p^2},x^{p^2+p}+x]=k[x]$ (take $f=x^{p^2}$ and $g=x^{p^2+p}+x$, then $g^p-f^{p+1}=x^p$). It is not trivial because the degree of one component does not divide the other one. In characteristic zero, there is no non-trivial embedding of $\mathbb{A}^1$ into $\mathbb{A}^2$. This is the famous Abhyankar-Moh theorem (Abhyankar, S.; Moh, T. T., Embeddings of the line in the plane. J. Reine Angew. Math. 276 (1975), 148–166.) 

Just to illustrate this on a simple example: take on $\mathbb{P}^1\times \mathbb{P}^1$ the divisor $D$ equivalent to $2f$, where $f$ is the fibre of one projection. Then $|D|$ is base-point free but any member is the union of two fibres (computing the intersection with $f$ we get $0$ so it is vertical), so is not irreducible. 

Let $LR(\mu/\lambda;\nu)$ be the set of Littlewood-Richardson tableaux of shape $\mu/\lambda$ and weight $\nu$. Then there is a canonical bijection between $LR(\mu/\lambda;\nu)$ and $LR(\mu/\nu;\lambda)$, presented in a paper by Pak and Vallejo ("Fundamental Symmetry map"), in a paper by Danilov and Koshevoi ("Commutor"), and in a paper by Henriques and Kamnitz. Is this what you want ? In the paper by Pak and Vallejo actually two "Fundamental Symmetry maps" are presented. Danilov and Koshevoi show that they coincide, and that they coincide with their "commutor", and with the map defined by Henriques and Kamnitzer. The references: Igor Pak and Ernesto Vallejo.

To establish that $U_k \cap U_{k+1} \subset W_{n-k+1}$: Consider the polynomial $P(t)=\prod (t-x_i)$. The elementary symmetric polynomials $\sigma_i$ are its coefficients, up to the sign. Suppose that $\sigma_k=\sigma_{k+1}=0$. This means that $0$ is a multiple root of the derivative of order $(n-k-1)$ of $P$. Now you can conclude that $0$ is a root of $P$ of multiplicity at least $n-k+1$ (that is: at least $n-k+1$ of the numbers $x_i$ are zero) by means of the following facts: 

About your first question: remark that when $m=n$ these matrices are sometimes called "semi-magic squares" (like "magic squares" but without the "sums along the diagonals" condition). About the constructions of families of such matrices, there is another paper by Brualdi: R.A. Brualdi, Algorithms for constructing (0, 1)-matrices with prescribed row and column sum vectors, Discrete Math. 306 (2006), no. 23, 3054-3062. You can see also this paper by Fonseca and Mamede on the same subject: $URL$ Here the construction is related to other combinatorial objects (pairs of semi-standard Young tableaux of conjugate shapes), as you wished. 

The evaluation of the Schur function $s_{\lambda}$ at the $n$th-roots of unity is the coefficient of $s_{\lambda}$ in the expansion in the Schur basis of the plethysm $h_k[p_n]=p_n[h_k]$ of the complete sum $h_k$ with the power sum $p_n$, when $k\cdot n=|\lambda|$ (and $0$ if $|\lambda|$ is not a multiple of $n$). Indeed, consider the Cauchy identity, $$ \prod_{i,j} \frac{1}{1-x_i y_j}=\sum_{\lambda} s_{\lambda}[X] s_{\lambda}[Y]. $$ Take for the $x_i$ the $n$th-roots of unity $\zeta_i$. Therefore the evaluation of $s_{\lambda}$ that you are looking for will be the coefficient of $s_{\lambda}[Y]$ in the expansion in the Schur basis of $$ \prod_{i,j} \frac{1}{1-\zeta_i y_j}. $$ On the other hand, $$ \prod_{i,j} \frac{1}{1-\zeta_i y_j}=\prod_{j}\frac{1}{1-y_j^n}. $$ This is the generating series for the complete sums $h_k$ evaluated at $y_1^n$, $y_2^n\ldots$ , that are exactly the plethysms $h_k[p_n]$: $$ \prod_{j}\frac{1}{1-y_j^n}=\sum_k h_k[p_n[Y]]. $$ These plethysms expand in the Schur basis: $$ h_k[p_n[Y]]=\sum_{\lambda} d(\lambda,(k),n) s_{\lambda}[Y].$$ The coefficient $d(\lambda,(k),n)$ is the evaluation you are looking for, for $k \cdot n = |\lambda|$. For any particular computation of the $d(\lambda,(k),n)$ you may use SAGE or John Stembridge's SF package for Maple. For a general study, you should find at least some examples of such plethysms in Macdonald's classical book. You will find more recent results by googling "plethysms power sums complete sums in Schur", for instance by William Doran, or Carbonara+Remmel+Yang. EDIT: Actually it is easy to evaluate the Schur polynomials at the $n$-the roots of unity, from the definition of the Schur polynomials as "bialternants". One gets that the evaluation of the Schur polynomial is nonzero if and only if the classes modulo $n$ of $\lambda_n$, $\lambda_{n-1}+1, \ldots, \lambda_1+{n-1}$ are a permutation of the classes of $0,1,\ldots,n-1$. Then this evaluation is the sign of the permutation. About the evaluation of the monomial functions, since this is what you are really interested in. A method for evaluating the monomial functions at the roots of unity is presented in Alain Lascoux and Marcel-Paul Schutzenberger's "Formulaire raisonné de fonctions symétriques", ex. 5.14, with a reference to a paper of 1881 by E. West. I think it generalizes indeed your computations by inclusion-exclusion. The method consists in expanding the monomial functions in the power sum basis. Note that the power sum $p_r$ at the $n$-th roots of unity is $n$ if $n$ divides $k$, and $0$ else. The expansion of monomial functions in the power sum basis is explained in Example 2.7 of the "Formulaire raisonné de fonctions symétriques". It is also explained in "On the Foundations of Combinatorial Theory. VII: Symmetric Functions through the theory of distribution and occupancy". Peter Doubilet. Studies in Applied Mathematics 51 (4), 1972. Say you want to expand $m_{(\lambda_1,\ldots,\lambda_k)}$ in the power sum basis. Consider rather the "augmented monomial function" (which is, by the way, the function you are really interested in): $$ M_{(\lambda_1,\ldots,\lambda_k)}=\sum x_{i_1}^{\lambda_1} x_{i_2}^{\lambda_2} \cdots x_{i_k}^{\lambda_k} $$ where the sum is carried over all arrangements $x_{i_1},x_{i_2},\ldots,x_{i_k}$ of $k$ variables. The expansion of $M_{\lambda}$ in the power sum basis involves the set partitions $\Pi$ of $\{1,2,\ldots,k\}$. They form a lattice under refinement, whose smallest element is the partition $\hat{0}$ in $k$ singletons. This lattice admits a Möbius function. Let $B_1$, $B_2,\ldots,B_{\ell}$ be the blocks of $\Pi$. The Möbius function on the interval $[\hat{0},\Pi]$ is: $$ \mu(\hat{0},\Pi)=(-1)^{k-\ell} \prod_i \left( \text{card} B_i -1\right)! $$ Set $\lambda(\Pi)$ for the partition whose parts are the $\sum_{i \in B} \lambda_i$ for $B$ block of $\Pi$. Then the formula is: $$ M_{\lambda}=\sum_{\Pi} \mu([\hat{0},\Pi]) p_{\lambda(\Pi)} $$ where the sum is over all set partitions $\Pi$ of $\{1,\ldots,k\}$. When evaluating at the $n$-th roots of unity you obtain: $$ \sum_{\Pi} \mu([\hat{0},\Pi]) n^{\ell(\Pi)} $$ where the sum is over all partitions $\Pi$ such that all parts of $\lambda(\Pi)$ are multiple of $n$, and $\ell(\Pi)$ is the number of blocks. 

It is unlikely to obtain for such a determinant the sum of all Schur functions indexed by partitions of $2n$ with four parts all even or all odd. Indeed, this sum is already equal to the inner product $s_{n,n}\ast s_{n,n}$ (see arXiv:0809.3469). About your second question: you can compute the inner product of symmetric functions in SAGE using the "kronecker_product" command. For instance, compute the inner product of Schur functions $s_{6,2}\ast s_{5,3}$ as follows: s=SymmetricFunctionAlgebra(QQ,basis='schur') s([6,2]).kronecker_product(s([5,3])) You may also use Maple with John Stembridge's package SF and the command "itensor".
