I too have an introductory level understanding of Kuhn’s philosophy. I have only just completed an introductory course in the philosophy of science and we only touched briefly on Kuhn's ideas, so you may wish to take what I say with a grain of salt. Kuhn’s philosophy deals specifically with the subject of theory choice. Those scientific theories which have come to be the orthodoxy of different historical periods (i.e., Kuhn’s paradigms) are objective facts of history. However, as Kuhn argues, there is no algorithm for theory choice and history shows us that the methods by which we chose our scientific theories contain various subjective elements such as social factors and prejudices. When you say that you “failed to understand how and why history of science can serve for more than descriptive purposes” you appear to be ignoring these objective, historical facts. Kuhn’s philosophy appears (to me) to undermine our faith in the correctness (and permanence) of our current scientific theories by suggesting the presence of a degree of epistemic relativism rooted in our social framework. As our social norms change over time, so too do our scientific theories. I believe that Kuhn denied being an epistemic relativist, but I also believe that most people read his work in this way. 

This is a question about predicate denial. Certainly in Fregean logic, where predicate denial is taken as the unary "it is not the case that", for a predicate P, P¬x is logically equivalent to ¬Px. So the question becomes, is the Fregean notion of predicate denial the correct notion to apply to the predicate "is falsifiable". Here, one might argue that "is falsifiable" is a vague predicate. With vague predicates, statements such as "x is neither P nor not-P" are often judged true. This gives a different view of predicate denial since the law of the excluded middle may not hold. 

Godel's result tells us that any sufficiently rich formal theory will permit propositions whose truth is not decidable within that theory. In some cases it is possible to prove that a proposition is not decidable. A well known example of this is the continuum hypothesis of standard set theory. In other cases it may not be possible to prove that a proposition is decidable because such a proof does not exist. In other words, decidability is not necessarily decidable. So yes, it is entirely possible that people are completely wasting their time working on such problems as the Riemann Hypothesis, the Goldbach Conjecture, or any of the other well known conjectures. EDIT Considering the idea of a "work around". Firstly, it must be said that a mathematical theorem is a mathematical truth, so the idea of working around it seems opposed to the idea of mathematical truth. Having said that, if we are willing to bend the truth, then consider this : Take the case of the continuum hypothesis of set theory. We can prove that this proposition is not decidable. We can also prove that both the continuum hypothesis and its negation are consistent with standard set theory in the sense that if we were to add either the hypothesis or its negation to our axioms, then the resulting theory would be consistent if set theory is consistent. In this sense, we can work around the road block and explore a set theory where the continuum hypothesis is true ( or false ). The axioms of any formal theory are generally taken to be self-evident truths. This is because we accept that some statements are true for no reason at all. Similarly, the continuum hypothesis, or any other conjecture which is not decidable, may be true for no reason whatsoever. However, in the case of the continuum hypothesis, its truth is clearly not self-evident. 

I believe that the majority of mathematicians would take this view : A mathematical object is a set of abstract entities together with the relationships between them. According to this view, the word property is synonymous with relation. For example, the set of integers is a mathematical object. The only properties of integers are those present in the relations between them. We do not invent mathematical objects, we only invent the notations we use to identify them and study their properties. Key to this view is that mathematical objects are identified and defined by humans in a purely abstract way, without any human baggage. There are many philosophical objections to this view. Deductive reasoning is not, as you suggest, a property of mathematics. It is a method humans use to explore the properties of mathematical objects. Logic and mathematics are not the same thing. 

EDIT 23, September 2015 I am updating my answer because my original reply was based on the misunderstanding that the A-series and the B-series are logically equivalent; this misunderstanding being based on an incorrect SEP article on Time which asserts they are "identical". Your question asks: can a proponent of A-theoretic time avoid the contradiction and associated infinite regress of the A-series by using the B-series. The answer to this question is no. The reason is that a proponent of A-theoretic time rejects B-theoretic time as an invalid representation of time; the two are mutually exclusive. And furthermore, the contradiction is not a feature of B-theoretic time - in the B-series, there is no way to express those situations which give rise to McTaggart’s contradiction of A-theoretic time. So let’s look at why this is the case. What McTaggart is arguing is that time is an illusion. He does this by arguing that if time is real, then it must be representable by one of two series, those which he calls the A-series and the B-series. Either time flows or it does not. There are not alternatives. Dynamic, moving time is modeled by the A-series. Static, unmoving time is modeled by the B-series. A-theoretic time corresponds to our intuitive notion of time as flowing from the future, through the present, and into the past. The contradiction and associated infinite regress of A-theoretic time is described in my original reply. Briefly; no event can be both future and present, past and present, or past and future. Yet time understood by the A-series implies that as time flows and every event will possess all three incompatible properties - future, present, and past. Attempts to resolve this contradiction by using tenses leads to an infinite regress which never successfully eliminates the contradiction. B-theoretic time describes time a unmoving. The temporal properties of events in time can be regarded as fixed and unmoving. The temporal relationships of “before” and “after” are fixed eternally. When we think of one moment in time as being before another, this relationship does not change. For example, the relationship expressed by “in the year 2015, the year 2100 is in the future” is true now just as it is true in the year 9999. McTaggart argues that the B-series in not sufficient for an understanding of what time is. According to McTaggart, we know more about time than just the information represented in the B-series. In fact, the concept of “the present” is not part of the vocabulary of B-theoretic time. This is because, McTaggart argues, that a being capable of knowing (and only knowing) all B-theoretic facts, would know all of the B-series relationships between moments in time, but would not be able to tell you today’s date since he would not be able to identify the present moment. The “present” is only part of the A-series vocabulary. To recap, McTaggart would consider your question to be ill-posed. Eliminating the contradiction of the A-series by using the B-series is not an option.
