$URL$ When Lady Jane Grey (c.1537-1554) was made Queen regnant of England in 1553 making her husband Guildford Dudley (c. 1535-1554) king consort was considered, but there wasn't time in her short reign. Queen Mary I (1516-1558) married Philip II (1527-1598), son of Emperor Charles V in 1554. The Emperor gave Philip a couple of his spare kingdoms and Philip became king consort of England. The title of Philip and Mary in England was: 

1) largest area. According to Wikipedia's list of largest empires, the largest thalassocracy or colonial empire was the British Empire about 1920 with 3.35 million square kilometers or 13.71 million square miles, 23.84 percent of the world's land area of 148,940,000 square kilometers or 57,500,000 square miles. $URL$ 2) longest lasting. The first Huang di of China took the title in 211 BC and the last Qing dynasty Huang di was deposed in 1912. Thus it can be calculated that the Chinese Empire lasted for 2,132 years. But the major Chinese dynasties ended in bloody civil wars often resulting in many millions of deaths and fragmentation of the realm often lasting decades or centuries. Thus it is hard to see government continuity between major dynasties, and it is common to refer to each major dynasty as a separate empire. The Roman realm was a kingdom, republic, and empire lasted from sometime about the traditional foundation date of 753 BC, or the usual date of the foundation of the Empire in 27 BC, until the fall of the western Roman Empire in 476 or 480 AD (about 502, 506, 1,228, or 1,232 years), or the capture of Constantinople by the Fourth Crusade in 1204 (about 1230 or 1,956 years), or the capture of Constantinople by the Turks in 1453 (about 1,479 or 2,205 years), or the capture of the Morea by the Turks in 1460 (about 1,486 or 2,212 years), or the capture of Trebizond by the Turks in 1461 (about 1,487 or 2,213 years) or the fall of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806 (about 1,832 or 2,558 years).

The short answer is yes a little research can trace the ancestry of Emperor Henry VII back to Emperor Louis III, but to accept that lineage you have to overlook the doubt about the ancestry of one woman in the lineage. And yes Emperor Henry VII has many other descents from members of the Carolingian Dynasty. Here you see that Carolingian Emperor Louis II, brother of King Lothaire II, left one daughter that married and had children: $URL$ And here it lists his grandson Louis III (882 or later to 928) the Blind, King of Provence 890, king of Italy 900, Emperor 901, deposed in Italy 905. $URL$ Louis III had a son Charles or Charles Constantine of Vienne. Who in turn had children. It is possible that there could be descendants of those children. $URL$ To find a descent from Emperor Louis III the best bet would be a descent from a Capetian King of France. This chart shows the ancestors of Emperor Henry VII back to great great grandparents: $URL$ Emperor Henry VII's great great grandfather Emperor Baldwin I of Constantinople married Marie of Champagne, the mother of his daughter Margaret. Marie of Champagne was the daughter of Count Henry I of Champagne and Marie of France, daughter of King Louis VII and Eleanor of Aquitaine. Louis VII was the son of Louis VI, who was the son of Philip I, who was the son of Henry I, who was the Son of Robert II and Constance of Arles. Constance of Arles was the daughter of Count William I of Provence, who was the son of Boso II and Constance. Who was this earlier Constance? Who indeed. Some sources say that Charles Constantine, Count of Vienne, son of Emperor Louis III, had a daughter Constance (920/30-963) that married Boson Count of Avignon. Boson Count of Avignon seems to be the same person as Boso II above. $URL$ Boson and Constance's son William II (955?-993) was the father of Constance (987/89-1032) wife of Robert II of France. $URL$ $URL$ But medieval Lands makes it quite clear that the ancestry of Constance wife of Boson, grandmother of Constance of Arles, is unknown. Thus anyone who overlooks the uncertainty about the ancestry of that Constance can claim that Emperor Henry VII was descended from Emperor Louis III. 

Tim Blanning The Pursuit of Glory has a whole chapter dedicated to this covering Europe between 1648 and 1815. It covers costs, travel times, and road availability as well as water ways. However, that is just a narrow part in time and local. 

I believe that the scene is 13 Warriors is taken from the account of Ahmad ibn Fadlān ibn al-Abbās ibn Rāšid ibn Hammād (Arabic: أحمد بن فضلان بن العباس بن راشد بن حماد‎) detailing his dealing with Northmen. This was a inspiration for Michael Crichton's Eaters Of The Dead which was a source for 13 Warriors. 

From what I have read, the level and intensity of training influences this massively. More green troops will break easily whereas veterans will tend to fight longer and harder. Panic is another factor: the more there is, the greater the chance of an army breaking. Mercenaries when not well paid, had a tendency to break or change side -- see the Thirty Years war for numerous example of that. Finally, a decisive key event: death of a general/leader, taking a position, or threatening the camp (with followers and your possessions) would do wonder to break the moral and route an enemy. 

I was led to believe that falconers (in Europe?) always used a glove on the left hand to handle birds of prey. However, this image show Mongol with birds on their right hands. So, how has the the handness of the falconry glove evolved? 

As far as I know, it was a platonic love which could go as far as non penetrative sex. Certainly having children was a big no no -- that would be adultery. Although, I am unaware of any formal definitions or codifications. In an age and class where marriage was for political gain, it was seen as a way to actually love someone one was not married to. I believe, but have no evidence, to say it was mostly a romantic idea found in novels more than a real social accepted norm. Henry of Navarra and the Queen Margot could have been said to partake of "amour courtois" outside of their own marriage to each other. Although, I do not believe it was ever refereed to as such. One of the impacts would be in the Arthurian legends where if Arthur was not so jealous, he would have allowed an amour courtois between Lancelot and Guinevere. Instead, he precipitated the fall of the round table. Jealousy is bad.
