Yes. He believed he saw indeterminacy of translation in actual languages. Of course his ideal case of "radical translation" involves languages with no common history at all--which never happens on this earth. English speakers can (and do, and must) draw on vast historical precedent in translating a closely related language such as French. But many language pairs are a lot less related than that. And all sciences build theories on non-ideal evidence. Quine was in fact an avid language learner. He lectured in Portuguese in Brazil, and in WW II he worked in naval intelligence decoding German messages. I have heard that he also worked in Asian languages for intelligence but I cannot find confirmation of that now. Anyway,Tom Tillemans article "Count nouns, mass nouns, and translatability" (in Chakrabarti et al eds. Comparative Philosophy Without Borders) quotes Quine's argument for one kind of indeterminacy, namely that of his "gavagai" example, based on actual features of Asian languages. Tillemans is skeptical of Qune's analysis of the Asian languages but he shows how Quine intended to describe actual situations in translating between languages (naturally with more evident indeterminacy for languages that are less related to each other historically). Apart from Tillemans' article, and my avowedly undocumented claim about working n Asian languages for intelligence, this can all be sourced from Wikipedia and Mactutor. 

The question is a bit like asking "Where should I go on my first trip to China?" You should go, or start, wherever is easiest and most interesting to you. Whether you read Kojeve, or Hyppolite, or the preface to Hegel's Phenomenology (or whether you visit old Beijing, or the hotspots of Shanghai, or take a Yangtze River cruise) you will learn a lot. And no matter where you start you will not master the subject until you start over in a lot of other places where you could just as well have begun. Stanley Rosen used to say Kojeve wrote the only commentary on Hegel worth reading, because it is the only one that is not on Hegel. To be more helpful: Kojeve masters Hegel's thought and uses it in important ways, he does not reproduce it (which, by the way, means there is an alternative to the grim picture painted by Philip Klöcking in a comment to the question). Rosen may have been exactly right about that. But you probably should not read Kojeve's whole book before beginning Hegel. You could plunge into the dramatically involving Phenomenology, or for a quick easy start that hits many typical themes read the introduction to Hegel's Philosophy of History. You cannot grasp Hegel without understanding the Science of Logic (also called the larger logic), and vice versa. Hegel says you have to read that, and then come back to it much later to understand it. You could read an assortment of his prefaces and introductions without reading the full works, at first. If you just want to spend one afternoon on it, you cannot find a more comprehensive, orderly, accurate and concise intro than Peter Singer's Hegel: A Very Short Introduction (another refutation of Philip Klöcking's comment). But note that Hegel himself is "comprehensive" in very different way than Singer, and "orderly" in a radically different way. "Accurate" is not how most people describe Hegel, and Hegel himself is quite purposefully not concise. Or, for something completely different, spend an hour on Ludwig Feuerbach's 1839 essay Towards a Critique of Hegel’s Philosophy. It really depends on what you want to get out of it. If you want mastery of Hegel as a whole then start anywhere you like. 

Either one is correct. For some technical purposes it is convenient to bring all the quantifiers out to initial position as in your second version. For that, see "prenex normal form" on Wikipedia. But other purposes might favor the first version and first order logic per se just finds them equivalent. 

And it is hard to see that common sense or a daily life among objects would lead us to this claim. When Jameson says this "will be more thoroughly dealt with in what follows, inasmuch as it is a thought of extension and objectivity..." I guess we can believe that, provisionally. You must read on and see if Jameson does deal with it that way. The second half of your quote is simple truth. Hegel's Logic is indeed not like the Faerie Queene. And the history of philosophy shows so many people have argued for so many things that it is surely possible to argue that for Hegel Philosophy is itself a heroic contender. If I have missed the point of your question, and what you really want to know is what sort of thinker is Fredric Jameson, then I suggest starting with the Wikipedia article on him. 

There is not room to quote the whole essay here, or even the whole last paragraph. They explain Camus' point pretty well. The last two sentences are: 

To your final question: Rorty was happy to emphasize Kuhn's influence without needing to follow Kuhn. Search "forward to people who want to out-Kuhn Kuhn" to find a passage from Neil Gross's book Richard Rorty: the Making of an American Philosopher (p. 208) on this. As to the body of your post: Kuhn's Structure of Scientific Revolutions is very nice reading and very clear. It is about distinguishing science from other kinds of endeavor. He finds you can do that. So he goes with your 1). But he does not go with your conclusion from it. His chapter "progress through revolutions" says history shows successive paradigms in a single science like cosmology do not get closer and closer to each other at all -- and so cannot be getting closer and closer to some one truth. He finds science not exactly "stronger" than other kinds of inquiry, but suited to a distinctive kind of success in that normal science allows more focus than other inquiries, and the insistence on a paradigm means revolutions occur only when practitioners (virtually) all agree the previous paradigm became insupportable in light of some specific crisis and the new one resolves that crisis. He says, for example, some schools of philosophy show this kind of progress such as Aristotelians from Aristotle through Augustine and Aquinas to today. That school historically has done this and is still thriving today notably at Catholic universities. The most famous Aristotelian today is Alasdair MacIntyre who is very conscious of this historic change-through-continuity. But Kuhn notes Philosophy as a whole does not follow this course, since there are today still Aristotelians, and Cartesians and Positivists, and.... 

I don't know if this is what a philosophy site means by the meaning of life. But anyway chemists do not say life is just any chemical reaction. Acid dissolving limestone is not life. They say it is any chemical reaction that takes in energy from the environment (metabolism) and reproduces itself (or, to be more precise, takes in lower entropy energy, and disperses energy at higher entropy, so it is out of thermal equilibrium with the environment). So it is the biological definition that you give. Notice that on this definition it is problematic whether viruses count as life. And this is intentional. People do not agree whether they are a form of life themselves. Viruses have no metabolism, and they trigger host cells to reproduce them. The software product Avida more or less defines life as a system that that more or less accurately reproduces itself. See $URL$ . And I believe you can configure it so that your "organisms" need a certain rate of inputs to survive -- which is a kind of mathematical metabolism. Avida is adapted from Conway's Game of Life $URL$ as a way to make it useful for actual evolutionary modelling. But there is no one universally accepted mathematical definition of life. 

So, no, Sisyphus is struggling, not content. He is happy because his heart is full. What would make Sisyphus (or any absurdist hero) unhappy would be to say to himself "You know, I'm going to quit trying this, because it makes no sense." It is key to remember that, for the absurdists, nothing else you could be doing makes any more sense than pushing a rock uphill. For a view agreeing with some premises of absurdism but rigorously rejecting Camus's claim that the human condition is absurd, see Beauvoir's Ethics of Ambiguity. 

You need not worry about cultivating bad habits of Hegel interpretation by reading this as long as you read Hegel alongside and don't accept any interpretation that you cannot square with the source. The opening clause is idiosyncratic. Hegel says 

Deleuze in his book Bergsonism compares a passage of Bergson to Marx saying “Humanity only sets itself problems that it is capable of solving.” But Deleuze gives no cite to Marx. I can see the drift of this saying in Marx, but is there a reasonably close quote somewhere in Marx? Where? 

It is not true. The Analects do contain "If names be not correct, language is not in accordance with the truth of things. If language be not in accordance with the truth of things, affairs cannot be carried on to success" (Legge translation) and more to that effect. He does not say words or symbols or anything like that "rule the world." I take it that correctness of names is per se a semiotic issue. For more on this in the Analects, and in other Confucian classics, and in commentaries on them, search "rectification of names." But the closest you are likely to come to finding a modern sense of semiotics in ancient Chinese philosophy is the puzzle of whether "white horse is not horse" which might be better rendered "white horse is not (the same concept as) horse" or maybe "a white horse (is not just the same thing as) a horse." Most commentators take this to arise from a school of logicians who would be rivals to the Confucian school. Only a few ancient or classical texts on this survive. There are very many modern interpretations of this topic, which entirely disagree with one another. Start with $URL$ Another Analect also resembles the quote in a way. The correct way of ruling the world is for the ruler to do little but stay fixed in virtue: "He who exercises government by means of his virtue may be compared to the north polar star, which keeps its place and all the stars turn towards it." Virtue here is tightly tied to keeping the rituals, and in this sense to symbols. But ritual does not rule the world. Ritual leads to a world that rules itself. The false quote is really incoherent in Confucius'/Kongzi's terms. For him as for many Chinese people to this day a word basically is a character, it is a written sign or symbol. The pronunciation varies with time and region. Plus the pronunciation of a single character is ambiguous due to extensive homophony. So pronunciation merely represents the character which is the real word. If I may be permitted, since we are discussing words, I would suggest that in today's world, with much international travel, it would be better to use the Chinese name Kongzi rather than the latinate "Confucius." With great respect for the western scholars who first went to China and used latinate names, I feel it is better now to use the term more familiar to Chinese people. 

The Tractatus actually says nothing about Kant except some comments on the distinction between left and right in space. This is easily verified by searching any on-line copy of the work. As to what other works by Wittgenstein say about Kant or the absolute I refer to Conifold's comment on the question. As to what you might infer about the kantian absolute from the Tractatus, note that Kant and Wittgenstein both take ``propositions" (usually, they use the German "Satz") to be stateable items of knowledge. Kant finds that propositions can only be known when ``the corresponding objects may be given in experience'' (Critique of Pure Reason Bxviii). Of course he insists we have synthetic knowledge a prior which means it is not learned from experience. Notably this includes mathematics and the fact that every event has a cause. But their objects are given in experience, and this is how we learn that experience does not give us things in themselves. Absolutes like freedom and God and the universe as a whole go beyond anything that can be given in experience and so we do not have knowledge of them -- though we have beliefs and may use them as regulative ideas to organize knowledge. Absolutes are addressed in the Critique of Pure Reason only enough to say they are not objects of knowledge, in the paralogisms and the transcendental dialectic. Wittgenstein by the end of the Tractatus uses "proposition" in a very similar way, saying ``The correct method in philosophy would really be the following: to say nothing except what can be said, i.e. propositions of natural science." Now I think natural science cannot be understood here to mean only research science. And Wittgenstein was not concerned with distinguishing theoretical from observational in science, at last in the Tractatus. I think natural science here more or less means propositions verifiable in experience, rather as Kant says. I infer from this that Wittgenstein, in the Tractatus did not intend to say anything that could concern the kantian absolute. Of course many people drew great inspiration from earlier parts of the Tractatus and did not accept the ending of it. They might infer other things. 

Aristotle says only someone who has been well brought up can be "a competent student of the Right and Just, and in short of the topics of Politics in general" (Nic. Eth. 1095b). And I believe he somewhere says, similarly, that you cannot argue rationally with (or, perhaps cannot teach logic to) someone who is willing to maintain a contradiction. But I do not find that passage. Is such a claim about contradiction found in what we have of Aristotle?
