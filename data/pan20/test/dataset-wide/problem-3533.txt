It looks like you personally prefer your legs to be slim, but you legs are obviously healthy and have muscle mass. Soccer Players have large legs because all they have to use in the game are their legs! Most people would always prefer muscle to slim legs. But if you still feel dissatisfied by your legs(visually), then you could do some upper body weight training to even out the body shape. 

Your Lower back Pain seems to emerge from you studying too much, which means that you don't have a correct posture or proper seat with support. Although you can alleviate the pain, i recommend checking in your posture to prevent future problems such as chronic back pains. Exercise increases blood flow and boosts muscle activity , hence alleviating pain. You can perform the following stretches to further alleviate and build a stronger back. 

There are various breathing exercises for beginners with the kickboard: If you are right handed and prefer breathing from the right, then keep your left hand outstretched to the front of the board and the right hand bent and on the bottom side, then breathe from the right with normal kicking patterns by twisting your head to the right. The key here is to try to not tilt the heard upwards, only twist it to the right, at that time, half of your face will be outside the water and you can then slowly breathe. If you're left handed, then just switch sides. 

I've recently experimented with low carbing, calorie reduction and fasting. I think I messed it up for the past two weeks and have lost most of the muscle mass Ive gained. I am a novice, started getting into calorie counting, macronutrient partitioning, fasting and weight lifting (with starting strength) at around october of 2013. Ive gained mass and lost some due to my erroneous dieting schemes. I tended to binge on some days then fast for 40 hours afterwards to keep up with my binges. I recently found out that my fear of carbs, while helping me lose body fat for a few days, ultimately led me to a downward spiral of binging after days of deprivation. To cut things short, my last binge and fast afterwards episode has left me with muscle mass that is close to what I had when I was starting out and the body fat I have now has started to bounce back to levels I so dreaded to keep it away from. Is there anyway I can recover my muscle mass? My strength hasnt diminished yet but my muscle mass did. Ot are things too late for me? 

Judging by your height and weight, you seem like you require a more beginners approach to weight lifting and power lifting is not recommended. Since you dont have a solid base, it will be very tough for you to mantain a proper form. I recommend you to start using machines for all the mentioned exercises, the machines prevent unwanted injuries and also help mantain your form, work on the free weights only with an instructor spotting you and looking out for your form. Slowly progress increasing your strength and know your limits, as excessive weight can severely harm your back or cause troublesome injuries. 

The direct bone to bone punch could have got you a hairline fracture, (checkout the boxers fracture aswell) Or it could be a sprain. This is more likely, but be careful, stretching a sprained ligament only aggravates the problem, if it is a minor sprain, then you have to wear wrist support till the sprain heals itself. 

Foam roller - This is the ultimate self massage tool. Its my personal favourite and lets you give yourself a deep muscle massage. With the foam roller, you can also massage any muscle. You will also increase your core stability while doing so. The picture below is a popular foam roller by Trigger Point 

Im currently on a intermittent fasting regimen and my family has finally caught up to what Ive been doing. Theyre basically saying that im killing myself and this is not the way to lose weight/be healthy. Coming from a family that food and eating together 2 to 3 times a day is a center, this is tough for me. We tend to argue alot when I tell them I simply just dont eat when im not hungry and that I only eat at specific times of the day. Ive been worming out one excuse after the other but theyre calling BS now on most of it. Most of the time its my mom who is going ape about it, and with good reason too (I had hyper acidity growing up, she insists that it will comeback because of fasting, while in fact deprogramming my body with IF has tremendously helped my acidity issues to the point that I dont experience hyper acidity anymore) 

Im currently on starting strength, been doing it since the 3rd week of December (prior to that Ive been doing some dumbbell lifting, which was from October to November). Squat is at 155lbs Deadlift at 175lbs Bench at 115lbs Overhead press at 90lbs Ive made what I think are significant advances to my lifts but have injured myself a bit from time to time because of terrible form. Ive managed to fix some of my form issues for the past 3 weeks but have found that while I continue to relearn the lifts by fixing form, I struggle to handle the increasing lift load demanded by the program. Im unsure if its because of my diet or just my form (I believe its both though) that I struggle. Anyway, to cut to the chase, I want to do SS again by resetting my weights (i.e. starting with just 45lbs for all exercises) for a month and then moving up to my current PRs again, this time with proper form. However Im unsure of what might happen to my PRs and my muscle gains if I do this. But I really feel this deload is crucial for me to move forward. Im planning to continue my IF with a 4 hr feeding window, and then doing a -30% on rest days while maintenance on training days. The reason behind the deficit is because Ive recently upped my bf% to around 16% and would like to at least go down to 12% in 2 months or so. tl;dr: Would deloading for a week to fix form issues work for me or would it be counter productive? I will do -30% cals on rest days and maintenance on training days since Im at around 16% bf and would like to be at 12% bf in 2 months time with intermittent fasting. 

Your current approach -- breathing between repetitions of hanging leg-raises -- is acceptable. Breathing during the repetition is unnecessary. 

Muscle-ups and handstands require upper-body strength, which are best built by deadlifts, (overhead) presses, bench presses, chin-ups, and pull-ups. Muscle-ups also require some neuromuscular explosiveness, the potential for which is dominated by each person's genes. Muscle-ups and handstands both involve risk of impingement of the soft tissues of the shoulder between the humerus and the acromion, so take care to elevate and medially rotate your scapulae during those movements. 

Self-verification of a trainee's movement execution may be difficult or nearly impossible, especially if that trainee is unathletic. If a coach is absent then the next best -- though not necessarily sufficient -- option available to the trainee is self-made videos of the movement, reviewed immediately thereafter (for example, after a set of deadlifts). Starting Strength: Basic Barbell Training details five steps that a trainee can use to teach herself to deadlift, as well as symptoms of common movement errors and how to correct such errors. You can use these steps to teach someone to deadlift correctly. The Aasgaard Company has published several videos of trainees being taught/coached to deadlift. 

I've read this article here. Stating that BCAA suppliments can be substituted by consuming the whites of two hard boiled eggs prior to working out. I've been on an intermittent fasting regimen for more than a month now but have never tried consuming BCAA prior to working out (or any kind of supplement pre/post workout for that matter). Would the inclusion of 2 hard boiled egg whites improve my workout, protein synthesis, etc in the long run? I'm kind of afraid that by consuming the egg whites pre work out I might break my fast hours before I even want to start eating my post work out meal. 

I have read that rest weeks are beneficial for body builders since that extra week of recovery (vs a rest day) helps them gain muscle by constituting the healing process the muscle requires, is the same thing applicable to people who are going for fat loss? I have noticed decreasing levels of intensity and all out motivation to work out because of over training, and I was suggested I go on a rest week, would this help me in my fat loss venture? I feel so guilty today since it is day one of my rest week that I want to workout already though I feel like Im so tired. 

Its great that you love running up the stairs. You are correct that coming down has a slight negative effect on the legs specifically the knees. Running up for that matter, has very less impact on your joints, unless you stomp. The majority of the pressure is on your calf muscles, which is obviously a good thing... Over time your muscles grow stronger. You should also check out competitive stair climbing called "tower running". Where athletes from all over the world compete in climbing famous towers. Regarding the shoes, there is no specific standard but i would recommend a flat sole with powerful grip so as to avoid any accidents due to tripping. Best of luck and enjoy the climb! 

It looks like all your attention is on your upper body and lower body exercises, try developing the core muscles as well, developing your core will increase balance/stability and will reduce the chances of injury. Try Planks(All variations), crunches and back extensions. Running/jogging also builds up your core. If the chronic pain is too much or is consistently there even after exercises, then you might as well get diagnosed by a doctor.
