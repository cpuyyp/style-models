The first two threads on the spindle look stripped, meaning the nut will have stripped threads as well. The square taper in the crank is almost certain damaged from being used while loose. In other words, in my local slang, "it's munted" The proper, safe and reliable fix probably requires a new BB spindle and almost certainly a replacement crank. If you do not want to spend that much (I don't recommend this, as the crank coming off is a safety concern), replace the nut - its cheap. If you can source an used crank it should only cost a few dollars (local bike cop, recycle center or rubbish tip) I would do that rather than reuse the one that has fallen off. As already said, the nut and a washer will be under the dust cover on the crank. 

Because you can does not mean you should, however as an experiment, if it does not work you can always put the cassette back together as it was in the factory. Most Shimano cassettes that don't use spiders can be disassembled (usually cheaper ones). They are held together by either rivets or small screws with hex head. You can drill out the riveted one easily enough - these are no needed once the cassette is installed. With the right spacers, it would be possible to custom make a cassette with 3 or 4 cogs and any sizes you have availble (Do make sure the cogs a placed in ascending order, although ). The shifting won't work smoothly, as the ramps and stuff on the cogs will be in the wrong places. Refer Sheldon Brown - section "Building Custom Cassettes" 

Where I live it is common for commercial operator to purpose build trailers for carrying bikes such as these. The other option I have seen is custom bike racks for back of any flatdeck trailer or trucks. One event here has over 1000 entrants to a relay - they need to transport 1500 bikes on the day, up to 100km..... So it's certainly doable.... I am glad I don't do their logistics planning... 

In addition to the answer by @Nate, I also commend you for putting in 17 miles after a 24 miles ride. Don't beat yourself up over struggling a little. Be sure you allow plenty of recovery time. You do not get fit exercising, you get fit recovering from exercise. If you do not allow time to fully recover, you will struggle to get fitter. Two days after a big effort is not enough recovery time for someone our age who is not used to riding. (I survived that kind of abuse when I was 20-something, but not now, so answering a part of your question - yes, part of it is you are no longer 20). I suggest after a big day like your 24 miles, do no more than half that distance at easy pace two days later. (feel free to ask a new question on this) Another common problem for beginners is riding to too high gear. If you watch cyclists racing, you will see the pedals typically spin at about 80-90rpm - (Cadence). Many beginners pedal at lower cadence, as it feels more like walking speeds. Low cadence requires more power in each pedal stroke - and results in a fast burnout of the large leg muscles. Learning to pedal at faster cadence requires practice and concentration, but is worth the effort if you plan to keep cycling. If you are regularly in the lowest gear and pedaling slowly, it is possible to change your bikes gearing to give you lower gears. In summary 

Fitness - Schedule rides with breaks in between. Normally you would try to schedule a hard (long) ride once a week and a couple of easier rides - 3 rides a week maximum to begin with. The worst thing you can do is too much. To little will take you a bit longer to get fit, too much will set you back with fatigue, soreness and demoralize you - if it does not injure you. If you are very unfit, start with no more than 2 rides in any one week, at least 2 days apart. (Say Monday and Thursday). Start by going slowly, and build distance before speed. Your first target is getting to ride 8 Miles. Build this up slowly, and take your time to establish a starting point or "baseline" - start with an easy target. I suggest 1 mile (on flat ground) at a slow pace. If you feel really comfortable, do the loop again. Two days later, do the same ride and see how it feels. If its easy, add distance, if is hard (but not too hard), that is good. If too hard, drop it a bit. You will probably get a bit stiff and sore - remember the "no pain no gain" mantra from the gym - forget it. A bit of discomfort is expected, pain is bad. Once you have a baseline, build it by not more than 10% a week - 5% is probably a better target till you get used to it. If it is possible to leave you bike at work, build distance with the aim to ride to work on one day and ride home the next, slowly dropping rest days. Once you are doing this comfortably, ride to and from work one day and rest the next. Do this for a few weeks then increase the number of days you ride to work. When you are ready - start working on speed - ask another question here specifically around speed when you can comfortably do 3 *8 miles a week. Key thing is listen to your body. If you are getting more fatigued each ride, ride less. You do not get fit exercising, you get fit recovering from exercise. Your body needs rest days, you may need to rest for a week. Take it....... Elite athletes have off seasons for good reason, and many training programs have a monthly cycle with 1 week being very easy workouts only. 

Reason I do not ride a recumbent (based on my uneducated knowledge of them, which is probably ignorant and wrong, but typical.... ): 

Not only is the answer subjective - the "Best" will be different for each rider based on things such as budget, rider weight and fitness and skills, riders tolerance for bumps, riding style (speed, need for control etc), riding terrain, location, brand whoring, day of week, and possibly religion. However based on you questions criteria, If you must have an answer, I have to go with @GordonM Edit : ........ Note: This question addresses the original post, which has subsequently been edited. 

Taking it off and put it in the boot is the best protection, however if someone is prepared to steal the rack off the boot, they are just as likely to break into the car and help themselves to its contents. You could add a steel cable requiring bolt cutters to deter the thief but it won't stop them. If the bike rack is harder to steal than just breaking into the car (which is trivially easy for those that don't care about damage) it is as secure as possible. To prevent damage to the car and associated costs, you may be better to let them get the rack. 

I am in need of a new wheel set for my 29'er, and wondering if 650B's are an option. My current bike handles more like a supertanker than a bike. Great for straight lines once up to speed, but if there is a corner, watch out... The 650's are supposed to more responsive than the 29er and roll better than the 26". Additionally my wife rides a 650B, so we would be able to reduce pare tubes and tires. Bike has disc brakes so that is not a problem. Apart from lower BB, hence increased risk of pedal strike, if I were to put 650's on my bike, what disadvantages would I have.
