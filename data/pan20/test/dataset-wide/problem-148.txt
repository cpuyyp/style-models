The Worlds largest ant is around 1 inch long give or take. I wanted to know how large an ant could grow assuming conditions are perfect. Below are the conditions of their environment; 1: The gravity is equal to or less than earth 2: They would live in rain forests 3: They will have access to large amounts of meat and fallen (or rotten) fruit 4: This worlds oxygen content is 23% 5: Air pressure is equal to earth The only goal here is to make the ant as large as possible in the conditions above. 

The key here is not whether 1 eye benefits the creature, but whether 2 eyes do. Evolution tends to favor simplicity, and thus the most efficient use of resources given. Now if the species in question evolved 2 eyes, there's nothing you can really do. But if before your species evolved eyes, they went into an area where depth perception doesn't matter, like a cave, then another eye would be nothing more than another part that can get damaged. So, using the logic of evolution 1 eye would be equally matched with 2, if not favored. 

The exopack from Avatar is a lightweight atmosphere filtration system developed from civilian rebreather technology that allows humans to survive in conditions of unbreathable atmospheres with a minimum amount of equipment. It seems to perfectly meet your requirements. Added a same hatch in it would also allow for the mouth to remain free, while they couldn't breath at the same time its open of course. 

The Kasurigama was a ninja weaponn consisting of a kama (the Japanese equivalent of a sickle) on a kusari-fundo â€“ a type of metal chain (kusari) with a heavy iron weight (fundo) at the end. The kusarigama is said to have developed during the Muromachi period. Attacking with the weapon usually entailed swinging the weighted chain in a large circle over one's head, and then whipping it forward to entangle an opponent's spear, sword, or other weapon, or immobilizing his arms or legs. This allows the kusarigama user to easily rush forward and strike with the sickle The last point is where it shines against all other weapons, if you wrap the chain around an enemies legs and pull, you will be able to easily kill any armored opponent, in fact this one of the ways ninjas killed samurai. 

Technically Yes If we loosen the definition of 'plant' to a creature that uses photosynthesis and has chlorophyll, then multicellular creature that, before becoming what we consider plants may evolve to avoid things that eats them. It just requires that one mutation of a cell that both uses chlorophyll and moves, and BOOM you will eventually have plant that have brains like animals or plant animals, plantimals. Unfortunately they will not be fast, think a sloth or a turtle on land, but hey both of those survive. 

After France lost the 7 Years war, they were forced to give away land. No matter how little land they are forced to give, it is most likely that they will give away French Louisiana as all other land is more profitable. Because of the fact that this will not work for my alternate series of events I want to occur. After deliberating with a couple of Alternate Historians, they told me that the only reason they would not give French Louisiana to England is if they won the 7 Years War. It comes down to of all the territories France was willing to give up, French Louisiana was both the cheapest and the least profitable, if France has to give away land, they will give away French Louisiana. What is the smallest change I can make to history allow France to win the 7 Years War? What would the English give to France as a result of this Alternate Result? 

This is obviously a lot, but how much TNT does this translate to? A metric ton of TNT contains 4.184 gigajoules of force, so we actually have some left over from removing your meaty bits. But the crater will be so big that you should probably just use a different method. 

Though keep in mind that the new flying fish will be amphibious in a way, having to fly into water every once in a while. 

Does this seem reasonable? If you disagree with this statement: Gather some of your personal data and compare it with the global population. These can include country of birth; blood type; hair colour; and so on. Do you find yourself falling into the higher population categories? This data should lead you to conclude that you are an ordinary human - your properties reflect the global distribution. STEP 2: Imagine you have woken up with amnesia and have forgotten where you are from. 

Now I don't know about you but if I had to work in these conditions I would revolt very quickly and considering that everything in "Santa's" workshop is run by the Elves, he wouldn't last very long. Assuming that Santa is a glory hog that doesn't want to share, why don't the elves revolt? 

Alt History Hub Communism was a major rival of capitalism, both being on opposite side of the scale. We often say how the best, most stable economic option is capitalism, but when we look at media it tells another story. As a wild example of what I mean, look at apocalypse survivor groups in movies; In almost every story, the "good" group uses a communist system(the group provides for you and you work for it) but bad groups use a capitalist system(ration cards). This is just an example but it did get me wondering, can Communism be stable? Is it possible that a communist nation can remain stable under the basic idea of communism? If so, how can they do it? 

Just because they can doesn't mean they will. Most people have phones; why do they not call people in other continents to tell them about their phone? Many people have cars, why don't they drive to places that do not have cars? Despite the simplicity of this argument, it gives you the answers; 

Background: In a world I am building, France becomes a much larger power in the New world, actually maintaining control of French Louisiana and even gaining control of Canada during an alternate version of the War of 1812. Canada and French Louisiana eventually merge to form the French Republic of Colonial Canada (or the FRCC), when the FRCC attempts to become an independent nation of its own in the late 1870's, France refuses and the Canadian War of Independence occurs. The people of The United Dominion of Canada realize that while they are strong, the French Homeland is stronger, they need an ally. England is the best bet, but they are less than willing unless Canada decides to join the Commonwealth. Long story short, Canada take the deal and wins the war. The problem is that my lack of knowledge on the commonwealth and on England as a whole, means that I am making too many assumptions; That England would make such a deal, that such a deal is possible and that a nation would even consider this deal. While I'm having a great time imagining this Commonwealth Franco-Canada, I do not think it is even legally plausible to do so. All I need (or want) is a plausible explanation if the above is doable and if so, how I can make it so. 

No. The same problem is here for why elephants were not domesticated for food; birth rates. It can take anywhere from 11 to 18 months for the whale pregnancy to end, and even longer to raise; this means that the time it takes to make large quantities of whale meat are not worth the calories you benefit from it. 

Lets say that somehow a cube world came into being, on an axial tilt around its sun, four of the sides are in-habituated by intelligent life, one of these sides (relatively) quickly realized that their world is cubic and wondered what exists on the other sides. After thousands of years they have decided (in a space race-esque fashion) that they must reach the other sides. But they are still at the drawing board, looking for the cheapest method. They obviously have a lot of choices, from traversing the high gravity and inhospitable edges to building a rocket to just plain digging. Assuming that they have the same technology as us, what is the cheapest method of reaching other sides of a cube world? The dimensions of my cube world are 7000 by 7000 by 7000 kilometers, the gravity attracts everything to its very center point 

I can tell you the answer and provide you with peanuts on the way This answer depends on whether or not you want hard science fiction or classic science fiction. As in one FTL travel is easy and the other not. If you go with the former, then going farther than your own solar system will take many years to arrive at the closest star. (Unless we get into ftl tech, but that gets a little... spacey :D) This means that on the way, passengers can simply be told what their age is in local years. (similar to how flights tell you local time) They can also set their new circadian rhythm and sense of time. 

As Aarthew III pointed out, the body would relying on both hearts until one failed, this would result in the second heart straining to become stronger if the first failed. This would result in (most likely) intense physical training after the first failed. Two solutions come to mind (that haven't been said already); 

Your water world must be born as an ice moon Icy moons are moons that mainly consist of ice and water, it is possible that the core may be consisted of Ice II or some other polymorph of water ice. Now this is in no way what you want, but if we make this icy moon orbit a gas giant and then have this gas giant change its orbit from a Jupiter style orbit into a hot Jupiter orbit, then the icy moon is now technically in the habitable zone. And what does that mean? The ice will melt into water, creating a planet of mainly water. 

Theoretically there is nothing that will stop a species from evolving into a previous form, but to my knowledge there are no examples of this. In the span of a billion years a lot can happen, if the environment changes so that the species needs to adapt to it, they will evolve to meet the new environments requirements. Then if the environment changes back to a previous version, the species that live there will either move or evolve back. Keep in mind that the chances they will do this are extremely unlikely and even if it does happen, do not expect them to look 100% like their similar looking ancestor. Imagine the differences between foxes and dogs for help on this (just an appearance comparison). For your 700 subspecies, chances are that if the environment changes back, that many will go extinct, some will leave and some will change. 4/700 is almost .5% so it is in the realm of reasonable doubt that .5% of the subspecies will evolve back into a previous form if the environment allows it. So the answer is yes, but with a big ol' asterisk. 

After 10 May 1940 but before September 27, 1940 After looking a bit into this I realized that there were two major problems with this hope: America and Russia. If you want Nazi Germany to survive, we need to keep them out of the war. Let's start with America, although the war began with Nazi Germany's attack on Poland in September 1939, the United States did not enter the war until after the Japanese bombed the American fleet in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, on December 7, 1941. So we need to keep Japan out of the war to, which means this peace deal needs to happen before japan allied with Germany(they may still do pearl harbor, but they cannot be part of the axis), which is on September 27, 1940. For this, I suggest a timeline where Germany has put in clear unfair small print for Japan in the Tripartite Pact, and thus Japan does not sign, instead being its own side. Now for Russia, this is the biggest problem, as Russia joined in as it was allied with Poland. But this is where your answer lies. Germany needs to sign its peace treaty with Russia somewhere in late 1939 and unoccupy Poland, focusing on its Western neighbors. After that it will still, if nor more, heavily occupy France and likely win in holding it. After 10 May 1940 but before September 27, 1940 is your best bet 

Lets imagine a scenario, humanity has disappeared and a new species have come to dominate the world. Would this species have any memories of the concrete jungles or the human infrastructure? Would they even remember humanity at all all? Or would that be lost to pre-history? 

According to Mohs Scale of Mineral Hardness Quartzite has 100 absolute hardness, making it 1/16 as hard as diamond. The tunnel you want to build is about as long as The London Connection a 20 km tunnel through slowly permeable, seasonally wet, acid, loamy and clayey soils. This 3 meter wide tunnel took 3 years to build with modern tools in an easily diggable area. Now I'm assuming that your hand dug tunnel is as wide as a person. A simple amount of math implies that a tunnel of the same length but human size will take a year (plus 70-ish days) to dig with modern tools in the same area. But you want tougher ground and simpler tools. Give or take clay is 6 times weaker than Quartz, being lower than 1 on the Mohs scale, so even with modern tools the tunnel will take 6 times longer (around 7.2 years). There is no solid math rule I can find for mechanical tools versus hand tools so I am going to assume that they are about 20 times weaker (heavy drills vs pickaxes, seems fair). This will give me around 52416 days or 144 years. 

There are of course more rules that can be read here, but those are the most basic of rules. Using these as a base, would the Thing be able to take over humanity [that is make it so that there are no more humans alive of Earth], and if so, would it take the 27 000 hours mentioned in the Film? 

The Governments have become desperate and are willing to spend whatever it takes to bring Dave into custody. They do not want to kill Dave, they just want to bring him into custody. The solution cannot result in any human casualties. 

Let us assume that the ancestor of the first animal of the Homo genus (Homo Erectus) was transported to what would now be Moscow. They should be hairy enough to survive(unless they already have clothes) and there is no shortage of food. If they were allowed to continue evolving, what would they look like modern day? 

Obviously, the rules of probably say that it's extremely unlikely that these aliens would even be able to pronounce human sounds. How can the humans reliably communicate with the above aliens? How can the aliens reliably communicate with each other? 

After thinking about it for a hour (or two.... I don't have a problem, okay?) There are only two way I see this happening. 

Some Background The government is very good at catching people. Even the few who can keep away from them are forced into a life of running. But there is a new threat that the worlds governments face together, Alexander. Native to Greece and on a anarchic wave of crime, - causing car accidents and breaking into bank vaults - Alexander has managed to complete his tasks without even slight struggle. The current theory is that he has mind controlling abilities. The united nations agreed that he must be stopped. They have requested the help of Earth's greatest minds to come up with a solution. A Few Details of Alexander 

Following the Spanish American war, America gained control of Guam, the Philippines and Cuba and while they had made it perfectly clear they had no intention of keeping Cuba, the Philippines were another question. After a lot of talk on the subject and a public vote, it was decided to keep the islands but soon war broke out. Eventually it was agreed that the islands would eventually become independent and in 1946 it became independent from the United States of America. But is this inevitable? What is the smallest change I can make to history to allow for the Philippines to remain a territory of America and eventually a state? 

As you can see you are surrounded on three sides by water, this mean you only need to worry about the entrance which is explained lower down. You can use the water as both a drink source (combined with rain collectors) and an escape route. You can (though it's hard work) bring in soil for farm animals and crops. Now for sleeping and defense you only need the shipping crates and a crane (or strong forklift). Stack two crates for rooms; the top is for sleeping in case the perimeter is over run in also cannot be reached without a ladder or rope. and the bottom is for storage. As for defense, simply make two rows of crates against each other with the first row having another row on top of them. kind of an L shape.
