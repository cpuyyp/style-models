I think this is because of liquidity. If I am a poor household, and I own stocks (maybe via my pension?), if the price of those stocks go up, I cannot consume such extra income. Actually, if the stock market crashes, my capital gains can be wiped out! So in a sense, this is not "actual purchasing power", as it is the case with direct income like wages or transfers. So, to the day to day interest of a household, capital gains should not be relevant for their wellbeing. 

The theory of present value states that the price of a stock is the discounted value of the infinite stream of future income of the company. Several countries have had very very low interest rates, very close to zero. Yet, stock prices have not gone to very very high values, or even infinity. Why is this the case? Is this a proof that the theory of present value is incorrect? Or maybe investors think companies will not last "forever" (which they cannot, as earth's lifespawn is finite)? 

First of all, you need to expand the definition of a vector. It is not only quantities having maginitude and direction. While I agree that is the representation in $\mathbb R^2$, it is not always the case. Think of a vector as a representation of any ordered group of numbers $(x_1,x_2,...,x_n)$ and forget completely that you ever thought these implied magnitud and direction. We think of commodity bundles as vectors and not as quantities by themselves because we want to be able to explain consumption choices as bundles. Let me give you an example with a bundle of 2 goods, $(x_1, x_2)$. Think that $x_1$ is the amount of coffees that you can buy whereas $x_2$ is the amount of packets of sugar that you can buy. We want to be able to compare, say, $(2,1)$ with $(1,2)$. I agree, we could analyze both the choice of both goods separately, but ultimately we want to know what is the optimal consumption bundle and not the optimal amount of sugar and coffee separated. Now, did I say something that entails magnitude? Or direction? No. Bottomline, yes, we are thinking about quantities of goods, but when we say vectors, it means bundles of quantities of goods. That is ultimately what happens in the real world. 

Your idea was proposed more than 100 years ago by Silvio Gesell ($URL$ He wanted to create a National Currency Office, in charge of money. No private banks. Money would be created in accordance with amount of wealth available. It would also depreciate, to make people spend it. Read his book "Natural Economic Order". It is online. You might be interested also in Social Credit ($URL$ I am reading about this at the moment. Very interesting. 

But debt is bonds, accounts payable refer to money owed to suppliers ($URL$ Is it under "Other Current Liabilities"?. How can I know? Anyone has experience looking at balance sheets? I'm learning this. 

It is difficult to answer your question. The reason is that there is a conceptual problem with the "price of anarchy" literature. The literature uses the sum of utilities, and the ratio of sums of utilities, without reflecting on what it means to sum up utilities, and what it means to divide sums of utilities. In conventional utility theory these are all meaningless operations. Without clearer conceptual foundatinos, it is hard to compare the criterion that the "price of anarchy" literature uses to alternative criteria such as the one that you propose. Maybe one can interpret the welfare criterion in the "price of anarchy" literature as "relative utilitarian." I would have to do some work, though, to figure out whether there is any meaning to dividing welfare from different outomces when welfare is "relative utilitarian." 

I don't know if you refer to the extensive margin (some borrowers not being able to get credit) or to the intensive margin (one borrower not being able to get as much credit as (s)he wants). If you are referring to the former, one of the theoretical papers for borrowing constraints on markets with asymmetric information is the following one: Stiglitz and Weiss (1981) AER's paper on Credit Rationing in Markets with Imperfect Information. $URL$ The argument is very interesting. If lenders cannot distinguish between high risk and low risk borrowers, then the ''market-clearing'' (loosely speaking) equilibrium interest rates will be such that identical (to the observer) consumers can be rationed out. Other good papers are Bester's (1985) AER's paper on Screening vs. Rationing in Credit Markets with Imperfect Information. $URL$ Finally Chapter 16 on the Handbook of Monetary Economics by Jaffee and Stiglitz may help you. 

The concept that Brandenburger and Dekel (1987) call an "a posteriori equilibrium" is roughly the same as what Dekel and Siniscalchi call an "epistemic type structure for a complete information game" in which all types are rational and there is common belief in rationality. Therefore, Brandenburger and Dekel's Proposition 2.1, together with the remark that immediately follows the proof of Propoistion 2.1, is roughly the same as Theorem 1 in Dekel and Siniscalchi. 

A good article to read about this is by Susan Athey, Jonathan Levin and Enrique Seira. It has the title: "Comparing Open and Sealed Bid Auctions: Theory and Evidence from Timber Auctions," was published in the Quarterly Journal of Economics, vol. 126(1), 2011, 207-257, and is available online at: $URL$ The abstract includes this: "We study entry and bidding patterns in sealed bid and open auctions. Using data from U.S. Forest Service timber auctions, we document a set of systematic effects: sealed bid auctions attract more small bidders, shift the allocation towards these bidders, and can also generate higher revenue. A private value auction model with endogenous participation can account for these qualitative effects of auction format." 

There is a couple of macro theories that incorporate money into the utility function. These theories basically say that demand for money comes only from the fact that people like to hold real balances literally just because. I don't know what level of math you are comfortable with, but here is a set of slides for that: $URL$ 

Idiosyncratic shocks are those for which each individual face a different shock – while there is no uncertainty in the aggregate. Aggregate shocks are those which affect all individuals within an economy. When you have complete markets –– those on which there are securities for each possible combinations of the idiosyncratic shocks –– individuals will trade to insure optimal levels of consumption across all possible states. So, to get the value of risky options one only need to look on aggregate shocks –– as ultimately these are the ones which will determine prices. 

The solution to an optimal contract problem is called "first best" if it maximizes the principal's objective function subject to all constraints except the incentive constraints. The solution to an optimal contract problem is called "second best" if it maximizes the principal's objective function subject to all constraints, including the incentive constraints. Usually, one calls a contract "second best" only if it differs from the "first best" contract. 

This looks like a simple first order condition from constrained optimization. If the maximum is interior, i.e. if $t_i>0$, then the first derivative must be zero. If the maximum is on the boundary, i.e. if $t_i=0$, then the first derivative must be $\leq 0$. If it were $>0$, then we can't have an optimum, because then the value of $U$ could be raised by increasing $t_i$. It can be negative, though, assuming that $t_i$ cannot be negative.
