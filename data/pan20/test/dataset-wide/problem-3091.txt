What would characterize "zones of influence" is that, legally, the territories dividied would not be ruled by the colonizing power. They would leave a nominally independent local power, but that power would be subordinated completely to the local representative (embassador, etc.) of the foreign power. It was a form of "soft" colonization, which would ensure the colonizing power that natural resources and trade of the region would be in the hands of its companies and individuals, while not meddling with the internal politics (unless the local administration wanted to assert its independence, or was in danger of being topped by an hostile -to the foreign power- faction). The recognition in a treaty of the zones of influence was meant to be a way to prevent the powers signing the treaty from trying to extend their own zones of influence at the expense of zones recognized to other power. For example, with the treaty of Sevres, SW Turkey would have been legally a part of Turkey, but mining operations, critical infrastructures (like ports) and trade would have been controlled by the Italian government (which would have handed them to Italian corporations), and France could not make any intervention in that zone. That ruled out the possibility of the Turkish government playing them one against the other. 

It does not fit entirely the description, but I think you might be thinking about Herostratus. More than by suiciding directly, he sought fame by setting fire to the Temple of Artemis, and that lead not only to his execution but to a sentence damnatio memoriae that would erase his name from the records1, in order to prevent others from trying the same. 

It is Tannu Tuva. When Mongolia broke out from China in 1911, this little territory was separated from China (which was in a state of internal turmoil during the first years of the Republic of China) but was not claimed by Mongolia. In practice, Tannu Tuva was a Soviet satellite country, only the Soviet Union and Mongolia recognized it. Stalin annexed it to the SU in 1944. As a side note, the protests by Chinese Nationalist Government (the Kuomintang) about Soviet encroachment in it are credited as the reason for Stalin switching his support to the Communist Party of China. 

which gives a result of 497.5 years. For these timescales, the effects of supply of bullion pale with other effects (debasing, wars, economic developments). Now, for the first assertion, there are a few things to consider: 

Usually, the more "basic" the word, the more probable a common origin is. The names for "water" in a lot of languages sound notably similar, for example. COINCIDENCE Short words are more likely to have phonetic coincidences in other languages, and sometimes its semantics may be close enough. This often leads to confussions and false etymologies (Portuguese obrigado and Japanese arigato). That said, the data provided by the etymological dictionary seems rather convincing to me. 

Here are a couple of pictures more. Note that, since the word has been used not only in medieval times but also in modern ones, the item that it refers to has slightly changed in function and in modern times it is used almost exclusively for storage, so new designs look way more furniture than as a way of transporting belongings (for example, no handles or locks). And one of the definitions of from the online Cambridge dictionary (and others) is: 

1 While more tolerant with minorities than others, the Ottoman Empire was always the Empire of Ottoman Turks over other, second-class citizens belonging to minorities. 2 Anyway, I will not claim that Russia did or did not have a hand at this. I only claim that, even if there were no foreign intervention, the process is not difficult to understand, so I would like to see some documentats that justify claiming that it was Russia fault. 3 Again, the nation state was already the ideal model. 

More mundane buildings with a modest budget would be designed by architects with less formation who would rely in making almost every single wall a load wall. 

1And of course, we know now what worked and how it had to be used to be effective, but at the moment sending hundreds of thousands of soldiers to a big offensive on the basis of new, untested tactics and equipment was the kind of risky behavior that could lead to a massive amount of casualties. 2The generals wanted to have a solution to the stalemate/massive casualties; when they thought they had found one they were reluctant to leave it because it would leave them with no alternative to the slaughter... 

Given the dates, one thinks that (like in many other parts which were not in the main road to Berlin) the allies did not actually liberate it during the war, but occupied it / captured the german garrison after Germany had already surrendered; the map in this other article confirms it. So, no battles (neither big nor small) and not too much activity (compared with other liberations). 

Note that I am refering to the spread of ideas/etc. The origin of those could be very well a man living in an isolated farm, but usually the above mentioned points favor that, whatever its origin, the ideas spread faster through cities. Additionally, it is not hard to believe that the kind of man who spend his time devising new ideas would like to share them and listen to the ideas of opinions of men like himself, which would lead to him having a strong incentive to move to a city. 

Again, take both of these with a grain of salt, principally because none of those officially asked to break the personal union, but to maintain the separate institutions of each kingdom. Also, as these events are used to support or deny current political claims, there is lot of political motivated infighting that make it difficult to objectively assess those events (did the rural Basques support the Carlist before they were conservative as the Carlist pretendent, or because of the promise of the restoration of their laws? How many people did really support Charles?). 1 This is the official, stated posture. Some could argue that given what was at the stake (the partition of the whole Spanish Empire), the Catalonian leaders would not have get support for an "independent" king so they had to settle to support Charles as common King. For contrast, in the Catalan Revolt of 1640 they offered the crow to Louis XIII, which would have broken the personal union. 

Note that France was not the only collaboration government; even in countries who could not retreat to their colonies (Norway, Greece, etc.) collaboration governments were setup to make German control easier. The exceptions were mainly "German" (i.e. directly annexed) areas and in the East (who was to be depopulated anyway). As for disavantages, putting assets in other people hands always carries the risk of these people switching sides. That said, until the fall of the Vichy government, most of the French siding with the Allies did so as a personal initiative, and I have found no claim that the Vichy government did ever consider joining the Allied side again. At least, the Germans prevented the worst case scenario of the French fleet passing to Allied control. 1 And of course, the always pending question of expansion towards the East. 2 For example, the Allies had to mount an invasion of Madagascar out of fear of Japanese submarines refuelling there, battles were fought for Dakar, Gabon Syria and the UK attacked and sunk the French fleets at Oran and Mers-El-Kebir. 3 The French government refused it. 4 It was harsh, but if you compare it against the Versailles treaty imposed to Germany twenty years before the only significant difference is the occupation of the Atlantic coast, and that was a wartime measure that could be even considered as a measure that helped the defense of the French (Vichy) government. 

Of course, I am letting out monumental buildings (churchs, cathedrals, palaces) because these were often designed with the idea that the high ceilings would enhance the importance of the building. 

1Which, as you could guess, covers a lot of the languages currently spoken in Europe, India and in between. 

1In fact I did read some texts -not completely sure about how true- about Franco forbidding an exchange of prisoner that would have freed the Falange leader (José Antonio Primo de Rivera), and even reports of a rescue attempt cancelled without explanations. José Antonio Primo de Rivera was finally executed by the Republic. 2I did read in some historical works that there was a joke proposing Franco for the Physics Nobel, because the Falange styled itself "The National Movement"(El Movimiento Nacional) and Franco had got to "stop the Movement". 

1And in fact almost all other countries involved, including those that were way more liberal and less in danger than Germany in 1944 did also enact rationing and government control of the economy in order to support the war effort. 

Yes, it existed, but (as recoil was indeed an issue) it had to wait for some technologies to be developed. First, think of the difference of case use between the zamburak. The first was used by not industrialized nations, who were fighting enemies who could not field big numbers of "true" cannons. Against those undefended troops, the zamburak users could stay outside the range of the enemy weapons and harass them with their weapons. If they had to charge against an enemy with a good artillery support they would have been decimated before getting into firing range. Now, in more modern and industrialized conflicts, cannons appeared everywhere, and used better propellants (= more recoil) that black powder. So, small artillery pieces had not the range or power to be effective and would be very easy to destroy, bigger pieces would be difficult to transport and would tore away unprepared vehicles. So, for regular artillery pieces to be effective you needed vehicles designed to be able to transport and fire them, and so self-propelled artillery came into existence. A few years later, it was thought that (since mounting the guns in vehicles resulted in a target very vulnerable to enemy artillery fire) it would be good to have some guns built with heavy armour around it so it could be used in the assault of enemy strong points, and so the assault gun was born.(Image from $URL$ For the apparition of an artillery piece that was both effective and light enough (and with not so much recoil), you would have to wait to: 

And with good reason. The Empire had lost almost all of its European territories to breakaway minorities (some of them supported by Russians), and the Armenians had their own. 

Sack of Rome (1527): The troops of Charles V had won over the French but they had been not paid. They forced their commander to march on Rome, that was taken and plundered. This could have been disastrous for Charles, as he had posited himself as the champion of Catholicism, against Protestant movements. But in the end it seems that it helped him, since the Pope stopped trying to interfere with his policies and become way more compliant. Sack of Antwerp: The forces of Philip II (Charles V) had declared bankruptcy and soldiers were, again, not being paid. They took matters in their own hands and plundered the rich merchant city of Antwerp. The consequences were a reinforcement of the Dutch revolt, and the decline (and consequently loss of tax revenues) of Antwerp. Thinks were more complicated with the business of the Catalan company in the Byzantine Empire. They were paid, but with newly issued coins that were severely debased and that they had trouble trading with. This fueled other issues that the troops had (conflicts with other mercenaries) and it came to a head when, in a meeting with the Byzantines, the Company leaders were killed. The soldiers proceeded then to fight the Byzantine troops and to ravage and plunder the country; they stayed in the Gallipoli region until they were forced to move because there was nothing left to plunder. After that, they came into service of the Duke of Athens. After the campaign, again they were refused pay and the Duke tried to expel. The Company fought back and defeated and killed the Duke; they took control of the Duchy and expanded it, and put it under the sovereignty of the Aragonese kings. 

Some capitalism was seen in the Modern Era (after the Middle Ages), with the trade companies. In those, the cost of preparing a trade expedition was too much for most individuals, so they would share the costs between them. But the main difference was the Industrial Revolution. Industrial machines were very useful and increased production, but also they were too much expensive for the average individual to buy and maintain. So the individual worker no longer could sustain himself as an independent producer of goods (because without machines he could not make goods cheap enough), and was forced to work in the factories for the owner of the machinery (the capitalist) to (barely) sustain himself and his family. Industrialization also lead to less reliance in highly specialized work (they were no longer smiths that had spent years learning the trades of their job, they were operators who knew of a small part of the production chain), so workers were easier to replace by others, thus reducing their bargaining power in relation to the employer. And the increased production rate meant that less manpower was needed, so a surplus workforce was created that helped keep wages low. Also, the need to get raw materials and sell the surplus did provide a new impulse to the colonization of new territories. 

Maybe you are confusing situations: Currently, the idea of "Reconquista" is just held to talk about the chronological and geographical frame, but the idea of a "managed" process to take all of the Iberian Peninsula back from the Muslim rulers is generally discredited as a "post-facto" fabrication (giving a "national idea" of "proto-Spain" to the several Christian kingdoms, and giving a political justification for their political union). After the initial Muslim conquest, the Muslim kingdom in Spain became an Umayyad reduct (the rest of the Caliphate came under Abbasid rule) and quickly developed into small Taifas kingdom. During the period, Christian kingdoms fought Muslim kingdoms, true, but almost as frequently the fighting was between Christian kingdoms themselves or Muslim kingdoms themselves. To put an example, the prototypical hero of the Reconquista, the Cid, was employed by the Muslim ruler of Valencia. The few occasions in which this was not true was in a few cases in which new Muslim groups came from North Africa(Almoravids, Almohads), unified the Muslim kingdoms and charged North. In those cases the Christian kingdoms were (mostly) able to ally against the pressing threat and, in occasion, get support from the Pope who declared a proper Crusade to entice European warriors against the fresh invasions. As per the Reconquista itself it was, in fact, quite brutal from both sides. Civilian populations were raided from one and other side, defeated soldiers and civilians could be sold as slaves, etc. In some occasions, religious striffe between Muslims and Christians happened even inside the same population at time of peace1 (with Jews being targetted now and then). That said, it was not more brutal than life and war in other parts of Europe or the Mediterranean at that era. Now, to the point of your question, maybe you are refering to some details of the decisive battle of the Navas de Tolosa, there was a foreign force (called by the Pope as part of a formal crusade). That crusader force defected before the battle; while some authors blame the heat, many others point that the Crusaders wanted to massacre the surrendered populations (of the towns in the way to the Navas), to which the Christian Kings opposed. Of course, the Crusaders were just in a razzia in which all that what counted was the booty they could get, while the Kings wanted to tax conquered towns and not graveyard. 1: For example, the revolt of the Germanies(Brotherhoods) 

Even after a few months of war, the situation in the Republican zone remained chaotic so, while a posteriori it could be said that the best course of action was arming the militias, it is understandable that the Government hesitated to do so. 

Depending of how you state the events, a candidate could the War of Spanish Succession. Philip V of Spain was recognized by the Crown of Aragon as King, but he was deeply distrusted (in part of being French, in part because the Borbon dinasty had imposed centralism in France) and later the Crown of Aragon came to support Charles II. Of course, depending of how you state it, it can be also considered a civil war or just an insurrection again their ruler, but I doubt you will find many examples so close to what you ask for. 

I am not sure what Hitler did know about the political details of Spain and I certainly cannot be sure of what he was thinking, so I will just laid out some data and thoughts: 

What the woman holds in her hand is a Cornucopia, which most likely makes the woman Amalthea. Since that goddess main achievement was nurturing Zeus when he was a baby, she is usually represented with her bare breasts (the perverts!). As to why she figures in the medal of practical sciences Nobel (chemistry and physics), I can only guess that since the cornucopia represents wealth and abundance, it is a reference to the wealth and abundance brought in by science.
