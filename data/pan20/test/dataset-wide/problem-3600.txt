The chest will be worked the same as with "hands-on-the ground" push-ups in the same position. The difference is in the wrists and shoulders with a slight difference in the range of motion. The effects of push-up bars are: 

As a rough guide, carbohydrates contain 4 calories per gram, so 24 / 3 * 12 * 4 will net you 384 calories. Assuming you're somewhere around 160 pounds (calories burning being dependent on a number of factors including age, sex, and weight), this chart shows that you'd need about an hour of mild aerobics, moderate elliptical training, or resistance weight training each day to "counteract" those calories. Of course, since your biscuits probably have calories from other sources, you're likely better off using the total calorie count on them. And, honestly, you're better off just reducing the total number of calories than trying to add exercise, because our bodies are built to consume more food in the face of exercise. If you're just worried about the number of "carbs", I'd say that you're better off using other metrics for your diet. While there exist various low-carb diets, most of which are panned by medical personnel, they generally depend on actually eschewing the carbs entirely, not trying to "counter" them with exercise. Reduce your total amount of calories rather than trying to follow some fad of eliminating one food group or another. 

Ultimately, it seems a lot depends on what gym you attend, how qualified the teacher is (all that is required for certification is a weekend seminar and a fee), how much supervision you get, and how good of a job you do of exercising safely and listening to your body. I will add the bugaboo of more extreme training methods such as Crossfit, rhabdomyolysis, essentially your muscles self-destructing due to the kidneys finding too many contaminants in the blood from breakdown. This is one of the few conditions that Crossfit acknowledges is a risk with their program, but the official response is somewhat disturbing in that it implies that this is not an actual issue with the program, but rather in participants being weak, or at the least not "true" Crossfit athletes. 

For the actual movement itself, if you can't quite hold it yet, Dr. Low recommends training with either a partner to hold your legs, or with elastic bands such as Therabands pushing against your feet. In either case, the load should be managed so that you're exhibiting maximal effort to hold yourself aloft in the cross position. 

Or, in this one, you're working on moving the hips left and right without moving your hands and toes. 

A few days ago, I was listening to a discussion of parkour and they mentioned two painful falls you should avoid. One I recognized, the scorpion, which is basically a faceplant where you have sufficient momentum that you wind up with your legs going up into the air and toward your head. 

There is a recovery time for muscle-building. A common mistake when starting out is to do the same exercises every day and to stall out in gains, or to lose motivation, because the muscles don't have time to recover. That period is variable based on age, health, and individual constitution, but it is only approximately 24-48 hours. Thus, your current plan has longer rest days built into it. If you're not in the best of help, or your recovery time is slower, your method might work better for you. But you might also be giving the muscles a little too long to rest in between. Try ramping up to their schedule, and see how your body reacts. If you find that you're seeing diminishing gains, or the strain is so much that you don't feel motivated to work out, scale back a bit. You may even find some middle ground by doing more days of two body-areas at a time instead of just one, but not quite going for their setup of three at a time. As to specific parts of the body that are being worked out, their method is focusing on opposing muscles. By working just the upper body, then just the lower body, you're making sure that you're not getting lopsided, say bulking your pectoral muscles without building up the back muscles to hold them extra muscle in place. And by making it a more regimented set of exercises, it reduces the change you'll decide to skip out on a part of the body "just this once" and wind up doing it all week. 

We're getting more into diet than a fitness question, but the evidence is pretty clear currently that "gluten insensitivity" either does not exist or cannot be tested for. The only scientifically determined problem with gluten is celiac disease. Everything past that is a mix of marketers taking advantage of the panic and misinformed people advocating the "try it and see" diet. Much like any other fad diet, including paleo, Atkins, etc, it can help people because junk food just happens to typically include gluten, but there is no real evidence for gluten insensitivity, just the gluten intolerance that leads to celiac disease. 

This basically comes down to that cycling is a more efficient movement than running, so they can therefore attain higher VO2. I believe my copy of Effective Cycling by John Forester has more details. 

Quite frankly, your best bet is to consult a physical therapist so as to avoid injury. Outside of that, one physical therapy site recommends the following: 

When you start poking around parkour videos, you'll start to see a trend of people wearing extremely baggy pants, often with the crotch hanging down to about knee level. This is particularly odd to me since you'll also find references to using duct tape to tape down baggy clothing to reduce air resistance, specifically taping down the cuffs to keep from tripping on them and to keep them from catching on obstacles. The closest I've found to an explanation is this article, which posits that it's a combination of follow-the-leader (everyone else is wearing baggy pants, so it should be good, right?), hiding sloppy technique (baggy pants hide the fact that your legs aren't quite moving together by masking the outline), and comfort (when not doing jumps, baggy pants are just plain comfortable). So, is there any particular reason why so many parkour practitioners wear extremely baggy pants? 

FitRPG fits your bill, I think. There is no storyline (their Kickstarter to add one failed to fund), but you do get to upgrade your character. 

I mostly agree with Marten's answer in that feet have changed with the widespread adoption of constant wearing of shoes, but I disagree with some of his other facts such as his assertion that there are no successful barefoot or minimalist runners (never mind that, at high levels of competition, arguing about minimalist equipment is kind of silly since they're working at the level of shaving off hundredths of a second). Essentially, some people have weaker, or even fallen, arches, or "flat feet" as the old term went. Sometimes it's something you're born with. Sometimes it's the result of past injury. If you have flat feet, you're going to need arch support, the same way that you'd need braces on your leg if you'd sustained injuries that left your legs unable to handle the regular impact of running. For most people, it simply is not an issue. The best advice I've seen on barefoot and minimalist running is to try it in small segments first, 50-100 feet. It does change your technique, providing strain in body structures that you may not have exercised, even if you regularly run in shoes, so you want to start out slow and then ease your way up. Listen to your body. Also, if you are actually diagnosed with arch problems, talk to your doctor. There's some evidence that barefoot walking or running can help, but actual results may vary depending on the cause of your fallen arches, and leaping into it is more likely to cause injury.
