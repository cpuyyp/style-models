If you haven't gotten any rewards at all for your extra hard work over the past two years (promotion, raise, bonus, etc), then it's time to talk with your manager. Find a quiet time that you can sit down privately. Talk to your manager about all of your hard work over the years, and ask what you would have to do in order to get a raise. If you think it's appropriate in your organization, ask what you would have to do in order to get a promotion. This also provides an opportunity for your manager to bring up a discussion about the returning developer. If he asks, it's your chance to politely discuss your feelings. Don't slam this developer, though, if the decision to bring him back has already been made. Be positive, and talk about how the company can best use his skills. 

In almost all employment situations, Minimum Requirements aren't a ticket to a sure job. They are simply the least you must have to even be considered in the running. Most often, many, many folks meet the minimum requirements and apply. It's up to the hiring manager to choose among the many to hire the best candidates - those who meet the minimum, but also have the potential to be great hires. You might well find several candidates who have the right background to meet the requirements, but are jerks to others. You might find an otherwise-qualified person who has absolutely no people skills. You might find someone who meets the minimum requirements, but has never been able to keep a job for more than 9 months at a time. You might find a candidate who has all the minimum requirements, but will demand a higher salary. The requirements are the minimum, they are almost never the complete picture of what you want in an employee. If you were an investor in IBM, would you want them to hire the first person who happened to apply and met the minimum requirements? Or would you want them to hire the best candidate among all the applicants? I know where I'd want to place my investment dollars. When you prepare to purchase a new car, you likely either have a written list of requirements or one in your head. Most likely you don't purchase the fist car that ticks all the boxes, instead you find several, and then weigh other factors (like negotiated price, etc) before ultimately making your decision. Doing so in a hiring situation only makes sense. 

No. Your salary requirements are your own, and have nothing to do with who sought out who. As a hiring manager, I have never taken that into consideration - not once. I have a position to fill, and a salary in mind. I might find someone for less, or I might be able to stretch a bit for a very qualified individual, but not very much. Remember that the hiring company doesn't care what kind of comfortable, work-at-home position you are leaving. That doesn't automatically make you worth more. They just want to fill the position, within their budget. Decide in your own mind what this job is worth to you, and have in mind a number below which you would just walk away. Then enter in your negotiations. Your talent, potential, ability to perform the job, and the value of the position to the company will determine what the company is willing to pay - not the specifics of your previous job. 

Be direct. Just says something like "I'd really like to work here. But could you shorten the internship for 10 weeks, so that I can have some time for a break between semesters?" Most employers would be fine with that. And you probably don't want to work for one that isn't okay with allowing you a bit of time off. When you want something, you have to ask the people that can make it happen for you. 

You did exactly what I have done many times in the past, except that I've never signed an "exclusive" without first having a relationship with the recruiter. (I have an agency that I've used for a long time. When job hunting, I am willing to be exclusive to them for while, since I know them well, and they know me well. That's not something I do with just any agency). You could also tell the spurned recruiters - "Next time, tell me the name of the company when you first contact me. I promise to immediately let you know if I'm already a candidate for that company through another recruiter. That way, we can both avoid wasting our time." Recruiters don't like to have their time wasted - neither do I. Another trick I've used in the past when I don't know the hiring company is to do a Google search using phrases from the job description I was given. In every single case, significant portions of the job description I was given and/or company description matched exactly something on the company's site. In every case, I could easily determine who was doing the actual hiring. 

You could try and contact the developer, but don't be surprised if you don't hear back. If they really wanted to give feedback to all the applicants, they would have given it to you already. 

You are under no obligation to include all of your degrees on your resume. Since it's usually best to tailor your resume to the desired job anyway, when you apply for a retail position, simply omit your healthcare degree. However, if you are asked, you might need to account for the missing years in your work history. You may be able to get away with simply saying "I was taking classes" or something like that which is non-specific. 

This is perfectly reasonable and polite. That's the approach I'd suggest. And I always suggest that interns talk with their boss/mentor about what they should be doing if they run out of specifically assigned work. There are always "fill in" activities. Knowing what they are would let you do something worthwhile even when others are on holiday. 

First, you need to formally accept the final, non-contingent offer from Company B (I'm assuming that's what you plan to do, although you didn't specifically say that in your question), and get everything signed and ready to go. Then you simply need to talk to Company C and tell them that you have accepted another position. You thank them for considering you, and wish them well in filling their open position. That's polite, professional and won't burn any bridges. Any reasonable company will understand this and won't hold it against you. Hiring managers understand that timing is everything. They will understand that they didn't make you an offer, you had a great offer in your hand, and you need to make your decision in a timely manner. 

But if they wouldn't even grant you extra vacation days - which are one of their least-expensive solutions - you are unlikely to get much of anything. 

No. Nobody is irreplaceable. Not you, not anyone. Unless you are self-employed, your company will find a way to go on when you aren't around. It might be easier to sit back and avoid the work of cross-training now, but eventually someone else will be doing your job. Trying to intentionally delay that capability doesn't really benefit you. If you get on top of that now, you put yourself in a position to move on to better, and more important work, rather than being burdened by always having to do exactly what you are doing now. Your feelings are understandable. It's nice to be heavily relied upon. It's nice to be "The Guy" or "The Gal" that others depend on. But in the long run, it's even better to be "The Gal/Guy That Makes Everyone Better". Be the one who knows the most but is happy and willing to share. Be the one who is happy to help others get better, and thus helps the team be better overall. As a manager, I worry when critical tasks depend on one person. In business, a single point of failure is bad practice. I work hard to avoid those situations, and to reduce the risk when they do. It sounds as if your managers feel the same. Ignoring their requests to start cross-training isn't wise. If you don't do it, eventually they'll have to find someone who will - perhaps at your expense. Once you have others trained up, you will likely find that it can free up some of your time to take on other, even more important tasks. In the long run, you will benefit from this, as will your team. You can put yourself in a position for a promotion, or for taking on more important tasks within your team. At a minimum, you'll be in a position to take vacations and holidays on terms that meet your and your family's personal needs, rather than worrying that you can never be away from the office for a few hours. That's a good thing for your long-term health. 

No. Your studies are more important than short-term jobs. You just realized that you aren't capable of doing both at the same time. Notify them as soon as possible. They may be disappointed, but will likely understand. 

You should answer with the real reason why you quit after just 6 months. Here you said "Due to certain reasons I quit my job". Obviously, that's a poor answer for an interview, so you are going to have to come up with something better. My advice is usually to be honest. Simply tell them the reason you quit. If the reason is something a hiring manager might be concerned about, then make sure you tell them why it won't happen again, and why you'll be staying with your next company for a long time. 

I have never seen a case where a company had a strict education requirement, but was willing to waive it due to an applicant's (current or prior) illness. If you always mention your Crohn's disease when you apply for a position, you could mention it, and mention how much you overcame while in college. But using it as an excuse for not having the expected degree classification isn't likely to come across well. If you don't normally mention your disease, I would continue to avoid doing so. 

I wouldn't. It's a bit awkward (if not presumptuous and pushy). But more because the General Manager probably doesn't know and wouldn't want to get your hopes up without certainty. Just talk. Try to come across as a great potential employee. And let things fall where they may. 

THY - I think this depends a lot on the kind of position you are seeking. For many jobs, the specific school matters very little. For other jobs, it's an important factor. Assuming you will be seeking a position in the Southwest similar to the one you hold in the Northeast, I doubt there will be much difference in the weighting of this factor. If the school was considered good enough by folks in the Northeast, I think you can expect similar goodness in the Southwest. Particularly with today's extremely mobile workforce, people usually don't make judgments based on the location of the college you attended. I can't remember any time where I did. People join from all over. I don't see any reason here why interviewers would discount your college experience. 

If you don't want to work for $5k less than you used to make while you were employed, then just tell them that you want more. Something like "Thank you for your offer, but that is less than I was expecting. If we can get together on salary, I'd be ready to accept your offer." would convey your desires. But only say that if you actually mean it. They may not be willing to up their offer. But if you truly don't want to work for that little, then it won't matter anyway. 

Store all pens with the point down. While it's not ideal for every pen type, it works for well enough for most. Almost nobody is going to use three or four different storage mechanisms in order to optimize their "pen storage effectiveness quotient". Most of the pens will be paid for by your employer, as you indicate point-down is safer, and life is way too short to be worrying about the "best" way to store pens. 

These are very reasonable questions for you you must have well thought-out answers. Be honest in your answers. There's a reason why you were not made permanent Director. Perhaps you aren't ready yet. Perhaps they are waiting to see if you can handle the position (in which case it may indeed be made permanent). Perhaps you don't want to be permanent Director at this time. Think it through ahead of time. Practice your answers. Get help from a friend if you aren't sure if your answers are convincing. 

You should ask for what you think you are worth. But be prepared to answer why you stayed in a job for 4 years for which you felt underpaid. "Because I was expecting an advancement and raise" is a reasonable start of an answer that you want to flesh out a bit. The fact that "there haven't been any open positions to ever advance to" might mean you were aiming too high, or looking in the wrong locales, or something else. Think that over and come to your own conclusion. Try not to say "I looked for 4 years and couldn't find a good job" as that might be a red flag to a potential employer. 

No, it's not unethical, tacky, or ill-advised. And it's certainly not fraud. Whenever you are in a performance review, it's a good time to seek a raise. In many shops, an annual raise is pretty much automatic anyway. And while you are planning to move "in about half a year", you don't know what will actually happen that far off. You might decide not to move. You might decide to move sometime further in the future. You might even decide to move and see if you can continue working for your current employer (in a different division, or perhaps even remotely). I believe everyone should see if they can get a raise every time they are having their performance reviewed, unless they have already publicly announced their departure. To me, this is just good business. It's important to get your current salary as high as you can if you are planning to seek new employment. Employers often base their offer on your most recent salary. Having a higher starting point adds up over the years. 

This format is more standard in my experience, even if the titles and job requirements are the same. In reverse chronological order: Employer 1 (date-date) (Job Title) (Job Description) Employer 2 (date-date) (Job Title) (Job Description) 

That may indeed be the reason you desire your form of contracting. Unfortunately, you are competing with a large number of others who are willing to do that sort of work for far less than you. When work can be done remotely, and on an individual's own time, the faceless workers become fungible, and the market rate drops significantly. You physical presence and face-to-face feedback is something you can offer that many of these workers cannot (or will not) provide. You may be squandering a big advantage by your choice. In my experience, the kind of work you desire is out there, but networking is the only reliable method I have found of finding it. Other methods can make it happen, but are far less reliable.
