As you're in high school, chances are this isn't likely to be a big deal. If you were a developer with 5 years of experience with a university degree and made these kinds of errors it may be taken another way. 

This would likely come across as a very arrogant answer as you are admitting to having nowhere to improve. You write flawless code in record time without any bugs, really? You probably do have areas where you'd like to improve and those are the challenges being referenced here. The key point here is what kind of weaknesses, vulnerabilities, or areas to improve is what is being requested here though in an odd packaging but that is the nature of this question where the key is to see how do you handle having to give a tricky answer as admitting to having a weakness is often seen as not going over well. As another example to consider here, how well do you give formal presentation to fellow developers? How about to non-technical people? Could you handle giving a presentation on the advantages of a software methodology to a dozen non-technical executives? 

I'd probably suggest a mix of sending an e-mail asking to discuss a change in the dress code rather than explicitly stating the change in that format. In the follow-up meeting presuming there is one, that is where you'd mention that you believe the former dress code would be better for you and give reasons for wanting this other than personal convenience. Make sure you have plans if the CEO happens to be near your area as this could be an issue if it isn't covered. Thus, you could say, "I have some concerns about following the dress code and would like to discuss this with you privately," or something similar where the point is to note that the dress code is the topic, you want this done privately and avoid getting too specific. 

"I'm sorry. I have other commitments to take care of tonight and so I'm unavailable to give you a lift." would be one of a few ways I'd phrase my response that says no with enough explanation that the guy shouldn't push things. The key is that you likely do have plans that you want to get done and so being this person's taxi service is what you have to decline though I'd think having some explanation is handy though "No" can be a sentence unto itself. 

There will be parts of the job that are outside of work in software development is something else to note here. Giving presentations, interviewing other possible developers and facilitating meetings would be a few things that come to mind that while not part of Systems Development Life Cycle, there may be an expectation that you know how to handle these. 

While you may have an idea of the technical work being done in terms of the Web UI to be built, do you have a list of other pieces you'd want him to have done over the time of his contract? Do you have secondary objectives that may include passing on some of his technical expertise to the team so that they can maintain the code he writes as presumably this will have to be maintained somewhere? I'd probably advise somewhere in the first couple of weeks to have a team lunch just to help build the bonds within the team of the new guy. This doesn't have to be fancy but the idea here is to help get those already on the team to help get to know the new guy. Similarly, towards the end of the contract, it may be worthwhile having a farewell lunch assuming you all work typical daytime hours. Talk with the consultant to see how often in that first week does he want to touch base. Perhaps it'll be a few times a day in the beginning and at other times I could see it being once every few days for the other end depending on his social preference. This is something where you want his input to help figure out what works best as in the beginning there is that ramping up that can be tricky at times. 

I've had tons of heated discussions where people can get rather agitated and so there is the question of how does one handle this? If an unreasonable deadline is given, how do you deal with that? 

I wouldn't try to schedule the second meeting before the first is had. The idea of the first meeting is to see if it makes sense to work together and do a bit of an exploration of, "Is there something I could do for you?" and if there is a match there, then the idea of scheduling a follow-up makes sense. It isn't worthwhile to tell someone, "Hey, I got to meet you twice before we do any business," as that could seem rather heavy handed. The key to the first meeting isn't that you are selling this person anything but rather wanting an opportunity to demonstrate your skills. Once demonstrated then they can decide whether or not to do business with you but the idea here is to give them some kind of sample so they can have an idea of what you do. 

Another source would be How 3M Gave Everyone Days Off and Created an Innovation Dynamo to demonstrate that this isn't that new of an idea at least for one company: 

How well do you know what is going on in the other person's mind? Do you always say "please," "thank you," and "you're welcome" with perfection in all circumstances? I know I'm human and so sometimes I may not always return a greeting. Imagine if you have an urgent problem that you have to discuss with someone and are heading to their office to resolve matters quickly. Do you even notice others that may say things to you every single time? Imagine if you're heading to a meeting or appointment late and are concerned what you are missing so you don't even notice those around you. Slightly different than the first in that it is just a meeting or appointment but for some people this may be enough to keep them in their mind rather than be courteous to others around them. Imagine if someone just got a phone call saying that they have a sick relative in the hospital with a major illness where they may not have long to live. Wouldn't you run to get out of the office to go say good-bye? Would you stop to acknowledge every single person you meet in a hallway? This is without bringing up other issues such as Social Anxiety that some people may have which could also be a factor. 

What expectations do you have from your co-workers once you've told them this news? Are you expecting them to keep track of your mood enough to know when you have one of these spells? Are you expecting them to give you slack when you do have one of these spells? This is the part missing from this question as while I do have anxiety and depression that has been diagnosed, I'm not sure I can say I know what changes in my work environment I'd want as a result. My field of expertise is web development so in a way I may be a person of a similar position. Now, for a point of contrast, I also have Sleep Apnea that is bad enough that I can have the occasional falling asleep during the day at work. In this case, I tend to be upfront in most of my positions now and have had positive responses since this occurs infrequently, I do have therapies that are mostly effective but not 100%, and I can spell out what to do when it happens. 

For new grads, transcripts may be used as part of how someone applies for jobs. When I was in university, I had a co-op placement for a couple of months that didn't work out yet it didn't appear on my transcript as I transferred into a regular program. Thus, I have hid some of my experience at times when I didn't consider it to be worthwhile for the jobs I was applying. 

No, as one could take their artwork from grade school that could be quite a bit of work yet I doubt this is how one would get hired as a professional artist as a simple example. There is something to be said for the quality of the work here that size doesn't dictate. 

If you've completed the paperwork that is acceptance of the offer, then the key becomes to find a way to terminate the contract which may be a challenge but then this is part of why you should have done more homework before accepting the offer. If you haven't accepted the offer officially, then you should be able to decline without penalty I'd think though this may depend on the laws of your jurisdiction in either case. 

What skills may transfer from one field to the other? What kinds of tasks may exist in both fields that could be useful to note? Configuring a "hosts" file is something I've done as a web developer that may be something some administrators do. Investigating issues may be something you've done in a network administrator role that would also apply to web development. While there is the side that you'll be starting in more junior positions, I'd be careful about undervaluing what parts transfer over here. 

While there is e-mail and phone as ways to contact someone, how do I know how local someone is when they apply for a job? If I have 100+ candidates that all meet my initial requirements, wouldn't it make sense to interview the local people first? If someone has to move this can cost in both money and time in some cases. The key point here is that if I have a pile of resumes, how does the company distinguish who should get an interview? There can also be that odd personal touch for some people, like an "I went to school near there," or "Oh that's a nice neighborhood," as there can be things inferred from the address,e.g. if someone lived in Beverly Hills or Compton for a couple of parts of California that one could contrast. 

How well documented are the processes you have? For example, deploying the wrong build on the live server sounds like it could be a major error that should be minimized by having redundant checks in place to ensure build X goes to server Y while software may well have bugs in the code as things may not be caught that easily. I'd be tempted to create solutions and propose them to the boss so that some mistakes can be avoided in the future. Be aware of what you may want to check a few times over and what may not be that great to do a bunch of checks against. Unfortunately, you are human and thus mistakes will happen. Perfection is rarely attained as more than a few of the so-called greats in sports missed the game winning shot like Michael Jordan. If you want some therapies look into Cognitive Behaviour Therapy, Dialectal Behaviour Therapy, as well as Acceptance and Commitment Therapy that would be used to battle the negative thought pattern you have here of wanting to be perfect. Mistakes will happen, the key is to consider how do you respond to them and how good is your emotional intelligence as self-awareness and self-management could be something else to study if you want another idea. 

While you may have an impressive resume and ability to solve problems, there are more than a few other pieces to the puzzle here to consider. For example, have you considered what kind of working environments you saw and how well your answers to various questions either aligned or misaligned with these environments? If a place is looking for a lot of collaboration yet in the interview it seems like the interviewer is pulling teeth to get more than a few words out of you this could be a sign of a problem. If you prefer to work alone with little interaction this could be much harder to find I'd imagine. Similarly, have you considered the flip side of what questions are you bringing up in an interview and showing that you want to know more about the job and can have the interviewer imagine you in the job. Perhaps it is worthwhile to consider taping an mock interview to see if you actually look like what you think you do. Could be a good experience to have, especially with a friend to be the interviewer and afterward watch the tape and discuss how it went.
