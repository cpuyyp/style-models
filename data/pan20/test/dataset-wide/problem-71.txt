In vacuum water has no liquid state--it behaves like dry ice does here on Earth. You could still have underground water and you could have an atmosphere that was just water vapor. 

There's a book that explores this: $URL$ However, you have only one which opens up the possibility to it disappearing/being destroyed. I would consider one of these outcomes to be almost inevitable--too many people in power are guilty of dirty deeds they won't want exposed. 

First, we need to examine our Average Joe. The highest human exposure I can find is an 8 Tesla field--it causes no harm to a person. However, fields like that can easily kill if you have ferrous bits in your body (the most common cause being an undetected pacemaker) or even due to nearby ferrous objects. As to the energy, the best I'm finding is levitating a frog with a 16T field. A human will obviously require a vastly stronger field. Thus I'm forced to conclude that whether this is safe or not is outside the realm that has been studied. 

While the temperature swings will be higher that doesn't make it impossible to live on. The areas of Earth that are the farthest from the ocean are still inhabited and certainly could be so with even more swing. You might not be able to grow terrestrial crops but local life could have evolved to survive the swings. The water cycle is another matter--the only way I can see for this to be viable is if there's something that causes far more evaporation from that small ocean than Earth experiences. Perhaps that ocean is really a huge rift valley, complete with gobs of vulcanism. Note that this would make the water unsurvivable for land-based life. 

Advanced civilization #1 is human. Advanced civilization #2 evolved on a gas giant and can only live under extreme pressure--they can't build spaceships because the only way to get the pressure they need to survive is gravity, there is nothing strong enough to contain the pressure. This does not mean they can't build probes that can leave their planets, though. They are extremely difficult to construct due to the changes that will take place as it rises from the depths, not to mention the rare materials that must go into making them. Hence their space program is tiny and the craft suborbital (so the materials can be recovered)--until they finally discovered how to open a wormhole. The energies must balance, a wormhole can only be opened to another location at the same pressure. Hence the hop from world to world without visiting the space in between. Humans get around by the same wormholes but the same pressure rules apply--we can no more jump into their realms than they can into ours. There could even be more than one such race with different temperature requirements. The Jovians and the Neptunians never want the same world so they don't find each other. Advanced race #4 lives in space and at an extremely slow rate. (Handwave--while I believe such a race is possible none can exist as their slow life process means slow evolution--there hasn't been enough time for them to evolve to civilization.) They aren't common, none of our scientists have noticed that some rocks in space aren't rocks. Our life processes are too fast to have come to their attention yet. 

You really need to provide more details as to what a mage can do. Assuming teleportation that's not subject to conservation laws: NASA would love them. You're looking at a few thousand dollars a pound to LEO. Lacking any idea of how (or if) your teleportation works I'll take Greater Teleportation from the Pathfinder RPG to work with: A caster barely able to do this and of average strength can port close to a ton to orbit (I'm assuming some weightlifters as assistants and Bull's Strength for everybody) split between 5 packages. While that won't be enough to lift any substantial satellite it certainly can lift the fuel for the satellite--use a rocket to bring the satellite up with empty tanks, fill the tanks at a space station and then it heads off into deep space. If he charged a million dollars for this service he would have the orbital industry clamoring to hand him money and would have no problem clearing over $100 million/year. 

You didn't specify where this takes place. Thus: You are fighting in very dense atmosphere (certainly not humans unless they're in some very good suits) or perhaps even in liquid (or in between--something above it's critical point where the line between liquid and gas is blurred.) Kinetic weapons have severe range limits, if you want to hit something far away you have to use a laser. 

There are two massive problems that make this completely non-viable and a third that's going to limit you. 1) Uranium-based reactors require a critical mass of uranium to work. This sets a minimum size for the reactor and from a practical standpoint a minimum power. Trying to power a house from a uranium reactor is like trying to power your toy boat with the engine out of a yacht. This can be avoided with a neutron-induced thorium reaction. No critical mass is necessary and thus it can run at lower power levels. 2) Shielding. It matters not whether you're producing a 8kw or 8gw, your shielding thickness is almost the same. Your containment is the same. If you want something safe to be around it's simply going to be too big for home use. 3) Cooling pools. Again, a shielding issue. They're big to put enough water between you and the hot stuff. Once again, something that won't fit in a home. 

Most of the events listed aren't all that predictable. We can see that there's a problem but at what point does it become apocalyptic?? Also, most of them are gradual failures, not specific events. A stellar explosion would be a specific event but we are nowhere near predicting them. We can say a star is reaching the danger point but does that mean it blows next year or next century? Impact events are the first things that come to mind but they aren't the only calamity that can come from orbital mechanics. What about a dead star that comes wandering through our system? Or a brown dwarf impact on the sun? White dwarfs would be easy to see coming and thus be widely known. Neutron stars with their beams pointed off to the sides wouldn't be nearly so easy to see, though, and black holes without substantial accretion disks would likewise be hard to see. 

I find myself disagreeing with many of the answers here. I see no reason to think ugly people would die. There are ugly people of both genders and they'll end up desperate--ugly will have sex with ugly. What I would expect to see are sex houses--places people whose clock is running out can go with the expectation of sex when you're desperate. There are two parts, the first akin to a swinger's club (although it's all individuals rather than couples) and the second part where you're matched by lottery and expected to have sex with whoever you are matched with, perhaps even with more than one person (if the genders don't come out even.) You'll also see sex workers of both genders providing such services. I don't think you'll see the huge abortion rates many are picturing but you certainly will have to abort most pregnancies as the death rate from accidental death will be well below the oops rate of any permitted contraception. Another thought: I think you would see more emphasis on a male version of the pill. The likely candidate we have would actually be tested. 

How about a totally different metabolism? Terrestrial life is based on the oxygen metabolism being in the cells. Lets try something totally different: The lungs are a much more complex system, the oxygen metabolizing system is in the lungs--instead of the bloodstream delivering oxygen it delivers the energized molecule that the creature runs on. The creature has a two-part bladder, one half holds the energized form and the other side holds the depleted form. It's a far more compact storage system than our bodies use, thus the creature can store much more energy. 

This is a public spectacle. Thus we are talking large, public fires--nothing to confine them. The burning is done at the time of the year where the risk of an ember starting a fire is lowest. 

Open a business: Clairvoyant Private Investigations. Use an .onion address and accept payment in bitcoin. While this is sort of like Tim B's answer I think doing it as a business will permit John to do far more good as the people who need help will feed him all the details they can (for example, the last known location of the kidnap victim. He can go there and follow them without wasted detours) and since it provides an income he can do this in lieu of normal employment and thus can devote far more time to it. Also, by working with the people and the police (and when the police realize he's genuine they're going to be bending over backwards to cooperate with reasonable requests) he can often do things more quickly. He sees the victim snatched by a car with the plate 123-ABC, the police can tell him who owns the car and what property that person owns--he can quickly check those locations rather than follow the car all over the place as they confuse the victim as to where they are taking them. 

Really a comment but it won't fit: 1) You're missing a big problem here--you have 5 megapascals of pressure trying to push under your cofferdam. Water is going to seep in pretty quickly playing havoc with your request for dry. (Oops, I originally goofed up and said 50, a zero placement error.) 2) Temperature. It's going to be awfully cold down there, can you say "fog"? And "dew"? 3) Your cylinder need to be at least 540 meters, not 500 meters--it needs to be tall enough to keep the largest rogue wave from going over the top. (Edit: Thinking more about this you need even more height but I don't know how much. The 40 meters was to cover the highest of rogue waves but this isn't a ship designed to cut the water, when the water strikes a wall that wide some of it goes up.) 4) Can you say "sea spray"? Waves are going to hit your cylinder, some of the spray will fall inside. You asked for dry. Finally 5) If you want your workers comfortable you will need to heat the work area--and that combined with a simple baffle in your cylinder will substantially cut the needed size. Edit: Why did I get the warning about hard science? This is an oversize comment showing more of the problem, not an attempt to answer it. 

Now, for some positive effects of this device: 1) All new powered land and water transport are electric. Not counting the battery, electric cars are simpler, cheaper and more reliable than gasoline engines. Now you only need to provide a starting jolt, your car then runs as long as you want. The advantages are even greater for trains (which actually are electric anyway even if that electricity is coming from a diesel engine) and ships. 2) The electric propeller airplane has no fuel costs. They still won't be cheap but they'll be a lot cheaper than current planes. I'm not sure if you could make an electric jet. 3) NASA uses it for deep space. The NERVA design gave an ISP of 850. Since this has a much lower weight the ISP will be higher. It can also run closer to the safety limit, thus giving a still higher ISP. I would guess something near 1000 would be possible. As this is roughly 3x the best space-storable propellants we have now (yes, this is cryogenic, but you have enough power that refrigerating it is no big deal) that is a truly huge breakthrough for them. (The rocket equation is exponential. 3x the ISP is far beyond just 3x as good.) 

Yes, if the orbits of the two planets are perfectly coplanar (something that won't happen in reality unless your engineers move one of the planets.) There are a lot of no answers based on trying to build a bridge--which is impossible--rather than the correct answer of building multiple bridges. Bridge #1: 

It can't be done. There are four problems, one of which I believe is a showstopper. 1) As others have said, the moon's orbital period doesn't match Earth's rotational velocity. This will require a cable with a slip joint between an orbiting ring and the cable heading to the moon. 2) As others have said, the distance to the moon isn't constant. You'll need two cables designed to slip within each other. While the two cables are actually in separate orbits and thus don't have special strength issues from this they will be forcing each other sideways as they won't agree on exactly where the orbit is. I'm not sure how great this force will be and what will be needed to keep the cables from damaging each other. 3) The moon doesn't hold exactly the same face towards Earth. You'll have to compensate for this wobble--just like with the Earth you'll need an orbital ring with a joint that can move. 4) Finally, the showstopper: The moon doesn't orbit exactly in the plane of Earth's equator. I see no possible joint to compensate for this.
