As a conclusion, I believe, we would have to at least accept that no compelling evidence is available for the assumption that Japanese kono et.al. are determiners, as we usually understand them. Rather, the lack of the expression of specification and genus, and the lack of parallels in syntactic behavior with determiners in other languages, suggest that kono et.al. are best described as adnominals. The answer to the question then is: No, Japanese does not have determiners. 

Japanese has two adjectival word classes (see for an overview here). One can be inflected, and members of this class can end in -i, an inflectional suffix marking attribution (among other functions). These adjectives are often called i-adjectives (traditionally keiyooshi). Since they can be inflected, and thus appear as a clause head, they have valency. The second class takes -na in attributive position, and they cannot be inflected. These adjectives are often called na-adjectives, or adjectival nouns (traditionally keiyoodooshi. The i-adjectives are a closed class, and the na-adjectives are open. Only very rarely does it happen that a new member is included into the i-adjectives. One example is kimo-i 

The expressions o- and go- are prefixes. They are not derivational, but also not inflectional affixes. I believe that's what's causing the confusion between "prefix" and "particles". Derivational prefixes are the negation prefixes hu-, bu-, mu-, mi-, and hi-. Attachment of these prefixes causes derivation from noun to nominal adjective (な形容詞・形容名詞). Here's an example: 

Note that (2b) is ungrammatical even though a subordinating conjunction is missing in (2.a). The word order in (2a) clearly shows V2-order, which is associated with main clause word order. Concerning your second set of examples, you are quite correct in assuming cliticization. The position, in which this is possible in many languages, is called the Wackernagel position, technically the second position in the clause.

Examples like those in (8) show again the proximity of compounding to syntax. A dependency-based account to compounding can be found here. 

In (1), the directional complement Tokyo is properly marked by the allative case particle -e (the dative particle -ni is also possible). Hence the sentence is good. Example (2) shows the accusative case particle -o instead of -e. The result is bad. If the case particles weren't somehow head over the NPs, that effect would be difficult to explain. In fact, assuming the following structure for Tokyo-e: (3) [KP[NPTokyo]-e] allows one to generalize over the noun Tokyo, and to arrive at the more abstract next structure: (4) [KP[NPNplace]-e] That means that any noun that references a place could appear instead of Tokyo in (1). Assuming that the place noun is head over the case particle would lead one to: (5) [NPTokyo[case-p]] Structure (5) views case particles as subordinate to their nouns. As a result, any case particle should be good. But example (2) shows that this is not the case. In summary, sentence (1) isn't good because Tokyo appears; any place name or local noun would be fine. Rather the sentence is good because the allative appears, rather than another case particle (apart from the dative). 

In contemporary Hebrew, znut means "prostitution". It's related to zayin "cock, dick". Concerning pronunciation, it is unlikely that Hebrew znut and English sin are related. The first Hebrew sound is /z/, the first English sound is /s/. Here's the etymology of English sin. One can see there and here that the Hebrew word for "sin" is חטא khe'. 

The compound heads in (7) are lady and bride. PPs and to-infinitival VPs must follow nouns, and this constellation is also reflected in compounds. I think that compounds of the type shown in (7) are significantly more common and more productive than the light fantastic, which to me neither seems overly productive, nor a compound. A bare adjective can rarely follow a noun, and if it does, we're probably dealing with a lexicalized construction. If the adjective is not bare, e.g. modified by an adverb, or if more than one adjective appears, then an appositive construction following the noun is possible: 

I have used here examples with o-, but go- means basically the same, but is normally used with Sino-Japanese vocabulary. There are, of course, exceptions. To summarize: o- and go- are prefixes, not particles. 

Concerning your specific assumption that isolated bands leaving Africa contribute to the founding of distinct language families, is, however, problematic. Diversity studies comparing African vs. non-African languages consistently show that the two major African language families Niger-Congo and Nilo-Saharan are much more diverse among themselves than all other non-African language families combined. (That, by the way, is also consistent with genetic diversity: there's more genetic diversity within Africa, than in the rest of the world combined.) This can either mean that many bands leaving Africa have not contributed to the current "gene-pool" of language(s), or it can mean that there weren't that many bands to begin with. Personally, I believe that the latter is the more compelling assumption because it matches what is known from studies on mitochondrial DNA. See this picture, which shows that only group L3 left Africa. This group may have been diverse, and surely consisted of different bands over a certain time span, but their genetic proximity suggests cultural proximity, and hence linguistic proximity. The assumption that members of this group used mutually incomprehensible languages is far-fetched, given that these bands weren't that large to begin with. I hope that helps. 

There is a paper by Pavel Caha on Lingbuzz that addresses this exact question. Put simply, Caha argues, within a nanosyntactic framework, that the underlying structure of gen.sg=nom.pl nouns is something like this: 

To the first question "Is the depicted dependency structure plausible at all?", one would have to answer: "That depends on the type of dependency grammar one employs". Kuhlmann, the author of the cited paper, uses a ("mildly") non-projective dependency grammar. "Non-projective" (aka "discontinuous") is any (sub-)tree structure when a dependency edge (the arrows that connects nodes as in the picture above) crosses over a projection edge (the vertical dotted edge in picture above). This property has been discussed at length within the dependency grammar literature. Please see the Wikipedia page on this topic [$URL$ Usually non-projectivity (aka discontinuity) arises when the dependency grammar views dependency basically as "government". In the next example 

The i-adjectives being the closed adjectival class in Japanese is also reflected by the relatively low number of basic members, about 130.

Paul in (1-2) is the subject of the verbs lives in (1) and met in (2). Subjects are arguments. Peter is the object of the verb met in (2). Objects are arguments, too. The PP in London is an argument in (1), because without a locative PP lives would mean something else. In (2), however, in London can be omitted without affecting the meaning of the predicate, hence the PP in (2) is an adjunct. Look at this page on Wikipedia for more information. 

Finnish, among a few other languages, is known for its partitive case. I have been told that in some Germanic language, partitive case is required whenever SV-order is absent. SV-order is absent, e.g., in the following English example: 

Since the subject cows follows the verb are, SV-order is absent. During a recent discussion of this kind of existential construction in English, someone mentioned to me that in some Germanic languages semantic subjects following the verb would be marked by the partitive. To my chagrin, I failed to follow up on this matter. I have never encountered anything like partitive case in Germanic languages, even though I learned five of them. Does anybody know whether there is a Germanic language with partitive case? If yes, is the partitive case then used for semantic subjects that follow the verb? 

The examples in (4) are bahuvrihi, i.e. compounds the meaning of which cannot be reduced (or is difficult to reduce) to the semantic composition of the individual meanings of the constituent parts. Skinhead and bluecollar denote persons. The examples in (5) are dvandva, i.e. compounds with two heads. It's difficult to decide which compound part is the dependent, and which the head. The examples in (6) show different types of exocentric compounds, all involving verbs. However, all compounds in (6) are nouns. While nouns are present in (6a), they are the objects of the preceding verbs, and hence one cannot assume that this type of compound simply results from syntactic structure. Headedness in compounds Headedness in compounds is highly asymmetric. If a language has left-headed and right-headed compounds, then it is highly probably that one of these tendencies accounts for the vast majority of compounds in the language (my guess would be in excess of 90%). Most atypical compounds, such as the (probably left-headed) pickpocket and cutpurse (type 6a) are at the border to lexicalization, i.e. the entire compound is learned and memorized as one lexeme. The preferred direction of headedness in compounds is inherited from syntax. The English NP has a clear word order within the NP, and the same order is present in compounds. That is, English minimal NPs are left-branching (i.e. right-headed), and hence compounds are also right-headed. When the underlying structure is not a minimal NP, then English compounds can take a right-branching, i.e. left-headed, structure: 

Left- and right-dislocation in German behave differently regarding the case the dislocated expression takes. Left-dislocation seems to be lenient, as it allows the nominative as well as the case the resumptive pronoun takes:
