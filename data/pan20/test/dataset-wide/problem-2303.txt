Other answers have addressed the "why", but let's talk about the "what's real" regarding lumens. Before we get into calculation the actual output of this light (which is definitely nowhere near 2000 lumens), we need to understand what lumens are. Lumens is the SI unit for luminous flux, which is essentially the total amount of light in the visible spectrum emitted by a source in all directions. Lumens does not depend on distance from the light source, because it must be measured in all directions. A related unit, lux, measures light at a point, and is dependent on distance. 1 lux = 1 lm/m2. If you were to measure the lux at every point on an imaginary sphere around a light source, add them up, and multiply by the surface area of that sphere, you would get the total lumens output of the device. No matter what the diameter of the sphere, you would get the same number of lumens. As you increase the diameter, the lux measured at each point decreases, but the surface area and number of points you must measure at increase. It turns out this is almost exactly how you measure lumens in real life - with a scientific instrument called an integrating sphere. An integrating sphere uses a highly diffuse coating to evenly disperse light inside a sphere. All light entering through the sample port bounces around so many times that the brightness is nearly even at any point on the surface of the sphere. A photodetector, typically a radiometer, measures the intensity of the light received at the exit port across all visible wavelengths, then sums the intensities to determine the total luminous flux. Below is a photo of the integrating sphere I used to conduct testing of bike lights: 

In some heavily used areas, especially where there's little chance for natural decomposition to occur (such as at high altitudes where there is poor soil), you're required to pack out all human waste. For example, climbers on Mt. Rainier in Washington are required to carry specific bags to pack out their waste. This is not the most desirable configuration for the climber, but is the most effective way to leave no human waste behind. Other than packing it out, there's not much you can do besides bury it. Burying the waste is preferable to leaving it exposed because buried waste is less likely to be carried into nearby water sources by rain runoff. 

At this point you've completed the primary assessment. Standard procedure is to proceed into the secondary assessment, which consists of collecting vital signs, patient medical information, and performing a more detailed patient exam. At this point things get more complicated and more difficult to self-assess, so I would suggest looking at more detailed wilderness medicine resources if you're interested. 

Glowsticks work well for illuminating players, as pointed out above. For illuminating field markings, such as goals and boundaries, you can use a variety of stationary lights. A flashlight inside a gallon milk jug creates a nice diffuse light that's easily visible but not blinding. You could use those for markers, as it would be cheaper (and safer probably) than buying full-fledged lanterns. 

A cast is meant to promote long-term healing of a broken bone, and getting a cast typically requires a doctor in a definitive care environment. A splint is the preferred treatment for fractures and sprains in the field. The purpose of a splint is to immobilize the limb around the injury. A good splint should be well padded, comfortable for the patient, and sufficiently tight to immobilize the joint without cutting off circulation distal to the splint. Where you should apply the splint depends on where the injury is. If the injury is on the bone, you should immobilize the joints distal (further from the core of the body) and proximal (closer to the core of the body) to the injury. If the injury is on the joint, you should immobilize the bones distal and proximal to the injury. The idea is to prevent movement at the site of the injury by immobilizing the limb around it. Before splinting Fracture types If there is a fracture, determine if the fracture is closed or compound, and check for angulation. A closed fracture is one where the bone does not break the skin; a compound fracture is when the bone has broken the skin. An angulated fracture is one where the bone is no longer straight. A compound fracture will almost always be the result of an angulated fracture, but a closed fracture can also be angulated and is at risk of becoming open. An angulated fracture can pinch nerves or blood vessels, resulting in intense pain at the fracture, reduced sensation distal to the injury, and loss of circulation. Therefore, it is recommended to apply traction in line (TIL) if possible. TIL involves pulling slowly but firmly to separate the bones at the point of the fracture, then returning the limb to its anatomical position. If you meet resistance, do not force it. It can sometimes take a couple minutes of gentle traction. TIL should not be applied to a severely angulated or shattered bone. TIL can be used with arms and lower legs. A femur fracture is much more serious due to the potential for blood loss from the femoral artery. Once traction is applied to a fractured femur it must not be removed until the patient reaches definitive care, and therefore requires a traction splint. Traction splints are difficult to improvise in the field, and there is some disagreement among wilderness medicine educators on whether traction splints should be applied as first aid. Wound treatment Once traction has been applied if necessary/possible, treat any cuts or bleeding around the injury as you would for any other soft tissue injury. If there is an open fracture, it's imperative to thoroughly clean the wound to avoid infection, especially if your evacuation is likely to take a long time. Infection management is often overlooked in first aid, and a little time taken to thoroughly clean and dress a wound up front will pay dividends later. If any portion of bone is still exposed, cover it with a sterile dressing, ideally moistened with iodine solution, and take extra care to thoroughly pad around the bone when building the splint later. Patient assessment This is somewhat beyond the scope of this question, but patient care extends far beyond just fixing the most obvious problem. Make sure to check the patient for any other injuries – an obvious and painful injury like a broken bone can distract the patient from less obvious but potentially threatening injuries. Learn the patient assessment system, monitor your patient's vital signs, and make sure you aren't overlooking any other problems. You also need to make sure to manage your patient's environment while treating their injuries. Don't get so focused on building a splint that you don't notice that your patient is shivering and rapidly progressing towards hypothermia. Getting on a pad, and under a tarp or in a tent before progressing to splinting is always a good idea. Splinting Arm splint Preparing materials After treating any wounds, you can now start building a splint. Remember that the splint should be comfortable, but also needs to completely immobilize above and below the point of injury. Make sure the patient's fingers remain accessible so that you can check their circulation and sensation after applying the splint. You will need a semi-solid structure to form the splint, as well as a lot of padding and wrapping materials. Arm splints and leg splints are generally approached differently, and you always have to improvise for the specific situation. I'll start by describing a standard arm splint. For almost any outing where I know I'll be more than an hour or two from definitive care I carry a SAM splint, which is a thin piece of aluminum covered by foam. The splint becomes very rigid when bent along the long axis to form a V, but is pliable enough when flat to conform to the shape of an arm and wrap around elbows. You can improvise with other materials – try to find wide flat objects rather than small narrow objects like tent poles.
