Are the emails you're talking about an inefficient way to communicate the information they are trying to communicate? If someone is asking you to do something and you have a number of follow-up questions, for example, it's generally perfectly reasonable to pick up the phone or walk to someone's office or schedule a meeting to discuss requirements. If, on the other hand, an email is sufficient to communicate the request, most business environments will prefer that approach because it's the most efficient way to communicate information. To some extent, in any sort of knowledge work, the amount of face-to-face communication you're going to have will generally increase over time as you work on higher level tasks where you're spending more and more time understanding requirements and discussing trade-offs. On the other hand, for someone just out of school, a lot of the tasks you're likely to be working on are already well-defined and don't involve a lot of independent judgments making them ideal to communicate via email. That's why middle managers, project managers, technical leads, etc. are in face-to-face meetings so often. 

If these are your direct reports, manage them. If someone picks up a task that someone else should be doing, simply tell the person that picked it up to let the person that should be doing it handle it. If you believe that no one on your team should be doing something, simply tell the team not to do it. If a small group of people is picking up tasks that everyone on the team should be handling, create a process to assign those tasks rather than looking for volunteers. Perhaps that means that every day/ week/ month a different person on the team is responsible for some task and you simply manage a calendar of whose responsibility it is. If you aren't the manager of these individuals, then unless they're asking you for help or advice, butt out. Your friends and colleagues are always going to do things differently from the way you would do them. Sometimes your approach is going to be better, sometimes their approach is going to be better, sometimes each approach works better for one person than another. You can't make your friends organized, you can't get them to exercise regularly or to avoid junk food, you can't force them to prioritize work a particular way. You are, of course, free to decline to listen to them whine about their choices or to occasionally point out that they are complaining about a situation that they put themselves in. But that may have negative impacts on your personal relationships. 

I'll assume that you've already fixed the issues that your boss found and done a thorough check that the report is now correct. If you haven't done that, that's the first order of business. After that, 

It would not be appropriate for an interviewer to compare your CV to other people's CV just as it would be inappropriate for them to discuss your interview performance with other candidates. Beyond that, it is certainly possible to ask. In the vast majority of cases, however, you're not going to get a useful response and you probably won't leave a good impression in the interviewer's mind. A company's HR department would generally tell interviewers not to provide feedback since that can only lead to grief if someone misconstrues feedback. Interviewers generally want to avoid criticizing a candidate as well. If they ultimately offer the candidate the job, they don't want the last impression from the interview to be criticism. If they don't offer the job, they don't want to get into an argument with a candidate that wants to explain why the criticism isn't correct or to ask for another chance to correct whatever impression they left. And then there are people that would try to drag an interviewer into a long, drawn-out resume consultation process. Beyond the fact that you probably won't get great feedback, asking the question generally makes a poor impression. If you're a 16 year old applying to bag groceries, it probably makes you look eager to improve. On the other hand, if you're a professional and you have questions about how you're presenting yourself, the expectation is that you can figure out how to deal with that. Perhaps you'd want to talk with your college's career office about how to create a CV. Perhaps you'd want to get feedback from friends and colleagues that can invest the time to do a real review. Perhaps you want to consult with a professional CV writer for assistance. Asking random interviewers for feedback isn't a good look for most candidates. 

Do you have an advantage if you're currently employed? Generally, yes. Employers generally prefer hiring people that are currently employed and those that are currently employed generally have more leverage in negotiations. Does the recruiter expect that you have a job in the field? If you're employed, generally yes. It is possible, of course, that the best candidate for a job is someone that is switching fields. But it is generally much harder to place a candidate that is changing fields since it is often hard for an employer to understand exactly what skills transfer from one field to another. 

I'd suggest having a conversation with your boss where you ask for advice about how he wants you to delegate tasks and who he wants you to delegate tasks to. Something along the lines of "Hey, boss. I know when we talked at my review, you suggested that I learn to delegate. I'd love some advice about how to do that without stepping on any toes. I've got task X (relatively small, relatively self-contained) that I'd love to get off my plate. I think (name of delegate) would do a great job on it. But I know that (name of delegate) is senior to me so I don't want to come across as asking him to do my work for me. Can you help me figure out how best to approach (name of delegate)?" This shows that you listened to the suggestion. It shows that you've identified what you want to delegate and who you want to delegate it to, which is a good first step. And it engages your manager to assist you in navigating the political environment (which will likely be different in different organizations and teams). This may lead your manager to sending out an email to the team letting them know that you're going to be delegating work to them. Your manager might tell you that he'd rather you delegate the task to someone else or putting some additional parameters on the suggestion (e.g. "Jane has been asking to get involved in that project, why don't you work with her instead" or "I've already warned Tim and Steve that they're going to need to pick up some of the tasks you been doing, give them whatever you'd like"). Plus, people generally like it when others come to them for advice (particularly when they can show they've put in some effort already). Depending on the team, the organization, your relationships with the team, it's also possible that you can just walk up to a senior team member and ask them to take on a task. If it works, that's probably an even better option. But that's also something that is very hard for folks on the internet to diagnose-- the reaction will be very different if your team members see you as a really competent contributor that is being groomed to be a team lead, whether they see you as just "the new guy," whether they see you "jumping the line" to be the team lead or whether they see you as the natural choice, etc. 

Since you are paid in arrears-- your paycheck covers the work you did previously rather than being paid in advance for work you are going to do-- it is best for the employee to be paid as frequently as possible. Once you've put in 8 hours of work on the first day of the month, you're better off getting paid for that time as soon as possible rather than letting the company hold on to the money for another 30 days until the end of the month. You'll have the same amount of money at the end of the month, you'll just have some of your money earlier. Conversely, it is (slightly) better for the company to pay less frequently. The company earns a bit of money off the float of holding the cash they owe in salary before they pay it out. The longer the company can hold the money, the more they make. That's why there are generally laws that limit how infrequently a company can pay its employees. For example, in the United States, there are more than a few states where you can't legally pay employees monthly or that limit which employees can be paid monthly. The Department of Labor has a table of the allowable pay frequencies for each state. Most other countries will have the same sort of regulations. Personally, I haven't come across a US company that had monthly payroll. 

Depends on the organization and the developer. Were it me, I'd start by physically walking over to the developer and asking for an estimate on when she'll be able to make the change. She may be working on a number of other projects and your task may not be a high priority for her. If you're not in the same physical location, I'd call or IM or use whatever other technology you have for higher priority conversations. I assume that you've alerted your project manager/ line manager/ whoever oversees your time that you are blocked waiting for this change. If the other developer isn't responding or the estimate she provides causes you problems, escalate the issue to her. Your manager/ project manager/ whatever exists to remove obstacles and to deal with getting tasks prioritized. If your request is a lower priority that can't be done immediately, that's fine as long as everyone understands how this impacts your timelines. Of course, different organizations and structures deal with things differently. Some expect developers to route all these requests through the project manager rather than going to other developers directly. Others expect developers to do more project management and negotiate priorities more independently. 

Normally, no one would care that you were technically awarded one degree a few months before the other. And normally it would be hard to have different start dates since you were initially likely to be taking core classes that were needed for both degrees. 

If you are an at-will employee, the employer can terminate you for any reason (other than a handful of discriminatory reasons) or no reason at all. An employer would be well within their rights to fire an employee that was looking for another job. Of course, most employers realize that most employees are at least open to the possibility that something better will come along. And firing an employee just for looking at other positions tends not to be a very economically reasonable action-- the company is guaranteed that they'll have to incur the cost of replacing the employee, they leave the position open while they look, they lose the customary two weeks notice to transition tasks to other employees, and arbitrary firings tend to negatively impact the morale of the remaining employees. 

Generally, this would be a bad idea assuming your intention is to get a job offer. From the hiring manager's perspective, there are two main possibilities. 

Generally, if you're looking for different types of positions, you'll want to have multiple resumes/ CVs each of which are tailored to demonstrate your suitability for one type of role. Your programming CV would emphasize your development experience in each of your jobs. Your writing CV would emphasize the writing you've done in each position. The business development CV would emphasize the business development tasks you performed. Obviously, each CV would be talking about the same positions, and each would probably mention the other skills, but the focus of your description should be on how the role prepared you for that particular field. 

Most universities have career fairs where company recruiters come to interview students that are about to graduate. Since the companies that attend these events know that they're recruiting people that will start in a few months once they graduate, that obviously simplifies the availability discussion. Your university's career office or the computer science department's office should have information about upcoming career fairs and/or recruiter visits. If for some reason your university doesn't have recruiters come on campus to talk with graduating students, you can still apply for other positions, you'll just want to indicate that you aren't available until after you graduate. Most companies prefer people that can start immediately but that doesn't mean that they aren't interested in people that have other obligations. Most employed people, for example, will need to give a few weeks of notice to their current employer or will need to finish their current contract before joining a new company. Since it often takes months for a company to find the right candidate, companies may be quite willing to make you an offer to start in a few months. 

It's highly unlikely that a creative resume/ CV will work better for you than a standard resume/ CV. One of the benefits of asking for a resume or a CV is that the format is relatively standardized. That makes it relatively easy for reviewers to find the pieces of information they're interested while still giving the candidate the freedom to present him- or herself in the most flattering light. Sure, most of the resumes for a particular position are likely to be relatively similar-- the people applying for any particular position are likely to have broadly similar types of experience and qualifications. That doesn't mean, however, that the information on the resume is any less important. If you want to be creative, find what makes you particularly attractive and compose a resume that focuses on that. Obviously, no program is going to be receiving applications from a bunch of students that have made groundbreaking contributions to their field. But there should still be something that you have that makes you particularly desirable. That might be your grades, it might be the set of classes you took, it might be recommendations from professors, it might be work that you've done outside of the classroom. Figure out what makes you attractive and compose a resume that helps you demonstrate that.
