Or, if you have a chain tool, you could just remove a full link from the chain, skip the whole master link business entirely and ride today and let future Leeroy deal with it. Being short one link shouldn't be very problematic. This is also the only option if you have a 1/8" chain as mentioned above, and don't want to replace it. 

It looks to me like you are pulling too much cable. It even looks like your brake lever is close to being able to bottom out against your levers. In normal operation, brake levers do not come out nearly as much as you have as in the picture. First thing to check is to make sure your brake pads are not worn out. If they are, replace them. Then re-adjust your brakes so that you have as little clearance as possible without any rim rubbing. If your wheels are so out of true that doing so is very difficult, it would be worth resolving that. Then, check your brake arm tensioning spring. This will help pull on the cable and to keep the cylindrical cable end seated in the slot on the brake lever. See if you can move the spring to a higher tension setting. Your frames brake post should have three holes in it, you can adjust the tension by removing the brake arm and replacing it with the spring in a different hole, and your brake arm may also have a tension adjustment screw to fine tune it. And just as a sanity check, make sure the cable isn't slipping through the cable binding bolt when you hit the brakes. 

I don't know about the pros/cons of using steel wire, brass wire or emery paper. I suspect that emery paper maybe wears down the material and not just the rust, and moreso than brass and steel wire. So maybe using a brass or steel wire wheel is still a better solution, but I actually don't know. The only right-sized wire wheel I ever found, which could also be mounted on an extension for the power drill, was this one: link. It's a 25mm brass wire wheel, for 1.6 GBP incl shipping. But it will take a month before I get it from China. I would then use it with an extension like this one (link). 

From my experience frequently carrying bikes, skis, roof boxes, and even 55 gallon drums on my roof rack, I've found that they pretty much all give a hit to the gas mileage, but the configuration doesn't really matter as long as you don't do anything ridiculous. However, a fairing helps cut down on noise tremendously. 

They are primarily used for high-performance road bikes for smaller riders. There comes a point where a proper fitting frame for a smaller rider will have strange handling using 700c wheels. 650c wheels are designed to address that. Smaller riders can also have road bikes built with 26" wheels. So if you are of average height there is no significant advantage to 650c wheels. 

The pie plate / dork disk between the cassette and spokes on my bike cracked from age and I had to remove it. I'd like to get a replacement but I can't seem to find any online. Also, do I just need to get one based on the largest cog or is there anything else to consider? 

I have a situation where the bike has (OEM) 8-speed Shimano Claris shifters with the cables coming out the side which interferes with the handlebar bag. (Photo below). SRAM doesn't list any 8-speed brifters at all, and Campy 8speed ergos are only available (second hand? genuine?) from Ebay. I'm looking specifically for brifters with internal cable routing - bar-end shifters are a fallback option. 

I found this video, and decided to do like him. He puts some kind of extension on his power drill, and on the end he puts a tiny 1 inch steel wire wheel. He drives the wheel up and down in the seat tube for some time until the rust is gone. I tried hard but never found a wirewheel this small in my country, at least not one that would fit on an extension. So I improvised. I bought a piece of 12mm round timber. In the end I cut a 5cm slit, using a hacksaw to make the slit as thin as possible. I cut a 5cm wide strip of the most coarse emery paper I could find, inserted it into the slit and wound it around the pole. The paper was sort of flapping, since when rolled compact together, the diameter was not as big as the inside of the tube. I thought this flapping was good enough, but after some time very little had happened. So I putting pieces of toilet paper in between the layers/windings of emery paper to increase the diameter. In the end I had a perfect diameter that I was able to fit into the tube, while it was still pressing on the sides. It took a few minutes to remove all the rust. The diameter of the pole was too great for my power drill, so I cut it thinner with a knife. But it was very difficult to cut in such a way that this thinner part was parrallel to the rest, and therefore the pole was hitting/hammering when rotating. It would have been much better to have bought a 10mm pole. 

As the person who made that claim, the reason is that allegedly some greases can attack the epoxies found in some carbon fiber applications, causing a breakdown of the CF structure, and causing expansion which will jam the post in place. The epoxy will otherwise not corrode, so it's not necessary for that purpose. The manufacturers also recommend you do not do it. I have a carbon fiber seatpost in a steel frame that I greased a long time ago before I learned about this and it isn't stuck, but I might just be lucky. And of course, if you use a grease specifically designed for carbon fiber applications it negates all these claims, for they refer to the run of the mill stuff. 

Can you help me figure out what metals they are made from, so I can move on to finding the appropriate welding or brazing? Thanks. 

I salvaged an old bicycle trailer. I have one concern though. The bar that goes from the trailer to the bike, I believe it's called the tow hitch, ends with a small rubber coupling, to allow for movement in all directions. The rubber has gotten brittle, and I don't trust it. Is it possible to either buy a new one or in any other way fix this issue? 

If the rim has been bent significantly for a long-ish period I would advise getting a new rim and spokes. An Al rim should not be too expensive, and you should be able to re-use some of the spokes. As @Gary-Ray mentioned - you are probably better off taking it to a bike shop, esp if spokes are rusted, bent and/or broken. 

I have two bicycles - one is an alloy MTB and the other is an old steel frame roadie. I intend to box them and keep them in my parent's garage for the next ~2 years while I will be overseas for work. Selling is not an option (for emotional and real value). I plan to box both bikes as they come from the manufacturer: 

I ruined the threading in my crank arm, and would like to weld or braze it back on, instead of buying a new crank set. It is a cheap old bike, so the result does not have to be perfect, but it should be cheap and durable. I have welded on iron (an exhaust pipe and the like) in the past, and if this was just iron, I could fix it with no problems, but in this case it is not that easy. Pedal arm: I think it is of aluminium. It seems light. Not magnetic. Looks like aluminium. I have no other guesses. Pedal shaft: Steel, maybe even cast iron? I don't know how to tell the difference. It is definitely not aluminium. The material is stronger than the alu in the pedal arm, since the thread is intact. It looks sort of dirtyish / dark gray. Dark gray like some heavy parts in an engine which I believe are made from cast iron. Only slight rust despite a long life. Very far from the look of a stainless bolt. 

It only seems strange to you because you've had the benefit of never having to learn the lessons of the penny farthing and the technological achievements of the safety bicycle firsthand (aka 'standing on the shoulders of giants syndrome'). The penny farthing is only awkward and dangerous because you are comparing it against a technological leap forward. That technology you are taking for granted, and are not realizing just how difficult it was to develop those technology without having the advantage of already knowing about it. Two of the key pieces of technology in a bicycle you are taking for granted: JamesBradbury's answer shows the dandy horse.
