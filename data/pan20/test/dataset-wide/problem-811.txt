In the movies you reference, I doubt that it was ever the intention of a movie maker to suggest that the craft was moving at a crawl when it began to enter the atmosphere. If the craft doesn't look like it is moving very fast, the idea is probably that the point of reference (the "camera") is moving at nearly the same speed as the craft, or perhaps that the craft is so huge, that the reference point is miles away. Everything is relative. There is essentially no realistic scenario where any object would enter the atmosphere at such a slow speed. Imagine, for example that you have an object, like Felix Baumgartner or something, which is standing approximately stationary in space above the Earth's atmosphere. Gravity will immediately begin pulling on that object and because there is no atmosphere to slow the object down yet, it just keeps accelerating as it falls. Even as it enters the edge of the atmosphere, it doesn't slow down much, because there isn't much atmosphere yet. Felix was moving more than 800 mph before he started to slow down. The International Space Station is another object that's sort of "stationary", in a manner of speaking. It's not going anywhere because it's in a stable orbit (sort of). But in order to stay up there, it's actually moving more than 17,000 mph, relative to the atmosphere. If something is "stationary" with respect to the sun, just sitting there in Earth's orbit as Earth comes at it, the Earth's atmosphere would smack it at 67,000 mph. That's how fast Earth orbits the sun. So there's really isn't anything that would just gradually drift into the atmosphere at 1 to 10 mph. If a craft were to use rockets to halt itself before entry, as you suggest, remember Felix again; it can become stationary with respect to the Earth, but then gravity begins its work, so if the craft wants to remain at a very slow speed through the entire decent, it has to keep firing those rockets all the way down. And certainly, nothing would burn up at that pace, other than a lot of rocket fuel. What causes the burning is not something special and hot about the atmosphere, but the fact that the object is smashing into the air (thin as it may be at that altitude) at thousands of mile per hour. It is even theoretically possible for meteors to enter at such speeds that the atoms are literally forced to hit each other's nuclei, and a part of the fire generated would actually a brief nuclear reaction. Response to Question Edit: (Thank you HDE. The initial question was very unclear.) The speed at which friction completely stops is 0. Any movement at all, even in that 1 - 10 mph range, produces a small amount of heat from friction, even if the medium you are moving through is very thin air (though certainly nothing one would characterize as "burning"). You seem to be looking for the speed at which that friction would be low enough to not cause a problem, but there's no magic answer. It depends on the situation. How delecate is the craft? How much wear is acceptable? Essentially, this question becomes something very similar to asking "How fast can I drive with something sticking out the window?" You are trying to keep the entry speed low enough that the wind is not a problem for you as the density of that wind gradually increases from practically nothing to surface air density. If your craft has a heavy, durable heat sheild, properly oriented, then extraordinary speeds are still not a real problem. But if you are trying to create a sand mandala on the roof of your craft as you descend, then you are going to want to control that wind level very carefully. 

Try the moon first. If you see nothing but black, assuming that you don't have a lens cap on or something, then most likely, you are zoomed in on, well, relative blackness. The star you were viewing is probably off to the side now. Or, you may just be looking through the eye-piece at the wrong angle or something. The moon is too big a target to miss, and you have nice rough features to use to tune in your focus. And if you see black when you are looking at the moon, it's much easier to troubleshoot. You should definitely see something! Now, secondarily the reason you expect to see something, but instead see nothing may be a viewfinder problem. If you have a small, low magnification viewfinder scope attached to your telescope, you usually can't just trust that what you see in the center of that view is exactly what your telescope will be aimed at. You may have to align it. Search "align telescope viewfinder" for help with this. From your description, it sounds like you are not using a viewfinder, but this seems to be a common problem, so I thought I should mention it. 

I'm trying to avoid an opinion-based question, so before I outline the comparison I'm proposing, I will qualify the specific facts that yield this comparison. By focusing answers on the relative accuracy of those facts, hopefully we can avoid primarily opinion-based answers. Facts 

Over the course of millions of years, planetary bodies, especially those closer to the sun, tend to lose their water and atmosphere as it is blown away by solar wind, and radiated or boiled off by other forces, unless they have a strong magnetosphere to repel the bulk of that solar wind, or enough gravity to hang on to their matter. On a much faster time scale, this also happens to comets as they approach the sun; thus, the tail. Over the course of millions of years, bombardment of planets by comets can increase the water and gas on a planet, or at least counter-balance the gradual loss of the same (depending on other factors like proximity to the sun, size, and magnetic protection). The Oort cloud is composed mostly of icy bodies (including solids that would be a gas at Earth temperatures). And it is from this region that comets "fall" toward the inner solar system. 

If you read an article that presents a hypothesis on dark matter and dark energy, that is about as much as you will find right now. No one on this planet knows what they are. We only know from the behavior we see in the cosmos that there must be something we cannot detect out there influencing the movement of the heavens. If you read and understand everything that has currently been written by an authority on the subject right now (January 2015), you will still not know the answers to the questions you have posed. If you truly must know, I suggest you begin by applying to enter into a PhD program in cosmology or astronomy. 

Perhaps alien contact is so mundane and commonplace that you dismiss it for lack of congruity with Hollywood presentations. Documentation of visitations and encounters is as old as writing and history. I'll give you just one example, among many. I like to read regularly from a collection of accounts which for some cultures has been around for so long, and has been so central to these cultures, that they just call it The Book, or The Holy Book. They began calling it this in Latin and Greek, and over time, that word has morphed into the word bible. This "Holy Bible" as these human cultures call it describes interactions of various kinds with a super-being who claims to have created this entire world, and us. It also describes interactions with other beings possessed of various great powers (technologies perhaps) who certify that they represent this same super-being. All of these accounts are given in the most sober and earnest language by men who were known by their peers to be very honest and forthright. Astonishingly, these texts even describe detailed instructions for communicating with this super-being using nothing more than the biology that this very super-being engineered into our bodies. Over the centuries, many of your own ancestors may have even written of their own encounters with this "God". I know mine have. In fact, if you read these texts, you can make direct contact yourself by following the instructions, and certify for yourself that His claims, as wild as they may seem initially, are in fact true. The copyright of His creation is, in a sense, stamped right into the nature of the created in that this communication mechanism which He built into our nature does in fact function as described. Amazing, but true. But anyway, are you sure that Astronomy is the right stack exchange for this inquiry?
