Study as much physics and mathematics as possible. Astronomy is essentially a branch of physics. If you're still in school, then take classes in these areas. If you're not in school anymore, then there are plenty of online resources to continue your education. This will allow you to understand what people are talking about when they discuss technical things. Decide what exactly you're interested in. There are lots of different areas of study within astronomy. Decide what appeals to you the most. Do you like planets? Galaxies? Cosmology? All of these different focuses require more specialized knowledge. Your skills are already marketable. Being an astronomer can mean lots of different things. There are some astronomers who hardly ever look through telescopes, and spend most of their time reducing data. A large part of astronomy is computer programming. As a software engineer, you may already have the skills you need to work with astronomy research. Keep an open mind. There are lots of jobs in astronomy research where you might not be called an "astronomer". For example, as a software engineer, you could find work with NASA supporting space research. Your job title might not be "Astronomer", but you'll still be in the field. Be prepared for hard work. Being an astronomer can be difficult, not just because of the subject matter, but also because of the effort you have to put in to get a job. It can be relatively difficult to find an employer looking for people with your particular skillset. My recommendation would be to keep an eye on the NASA Jobs website to see when they're hiring. You can also search for internships on NASA's OSSI site. Try some amateur astronomy. There are lots of ways you can get involved in astronomy without having it as a job. A quick Google search for "Amateur astronomy projects" yields many different results. Join a local astronomy group. If you live in a reasonably sized city, there should be an astronomy group near you. Find them and join them. Don't give up! Having astronomy as a profession can be difficult, but it is also rewarding. If you truly want to do this, you'll need to work at it. Just don't give up! 

No, the more I read about it, the more difficult it seems to be. In principle, if you sample regularly and often, you should eventually get a light curve, unless the period is the same as or a multiple of your sampling period. It's not easy to find how often GAIA observes a given patch of sky, but here it says that after one year of observing 

The Trappist-1 planets all orbit very close to each other. During NASA's press release, they mentioned that these planets are close enough to disturb each others orbits. Is this system stable over a long time scale? Or could we perhaps just have imaged this system before one or more planets is ejected or destroyed? Later into the press conference, one of the scientists says "these planets should have formed further out and migrated inwards". Could they possibly still be moving inwards, or are their orbits now stable? 

Yes, astronomers call it Faraday rotation. The polarization angle of radio waves changes dependent on the wavelength because of the galactic magnetic field. Sunglasses do not polarize radio waves, the wavelength is too large. You can polarize radio waves with a wire mesh. 

I do not know whether complimentary observations of the light curve are being done, but I will try to answer the rest of the question. Is it easy to observe the light curve with ground-based telescopes? No, it's quite difficult. From the Kepler homepage: 

This is our current universe, and we launch a photon from body A aiming at body E. (Space generated each second is marked with a symbol.) 

(SLAC Summer Institute on Particle Physics (SSI04), Aug. 2-13, 2004) But the same source mentions that 

Some theories allow for photon decay. In that case, the average photon would decay after travelling for 1018 years, which would give us around 9.461Ã—1030 kilometers. That's about a million times the current estimate for the diameter of the observable universe. 

so they seem to have repeat observations a bit more often than once a month. Cepheids have a period of typically 2 to 45 days (says german Wikipedia - didn't find it in the english article). If your sampling is regular, you should be able to get a decent light curve for at least some Cepheids. Complete guesswork on my part: Apparently, longer period Cepheids are redder at the minimum. Perhaps they use that to distinguish between the actual period and higher harmonics? 

When something is flying through the air, it keeps moving along with the Earth because it was already moving that way to begin with. Remember that according to Newton's First Law, things will keep moving in the same direction unless an outside force acts on them. So when a bird, plane, or helicopter is on the ground, they are rotating along with the Earth. In the rotating reference frame of the Earth, they are stationary. From an external frame which sees the Earth as rotating, the object will be rotating in the same way. Now, when a plane takes off, it is changing its motion relative to the ground. In that reference frame, it begins moving. However, from our external reference frame, it was already moving. So its just changing its already non-zero velocity. 

That should be in western China, since all of China uses Beijing's time zone. Reference: $URL$ --- Edit below --- In response to the comment by @adrianmcmenamin: I'll leave this as guesswork since I simply don't know the peculiarities of every timezone there is. Here's a back-of-the-envelope calculation for local noon in western China. The Sun covers 15 degrees in a period of 1 hour. All of China is on Beijing time (UTC + 8 hours). With the above, it's centred on $15 \cdot 8 = 120^{\circ}$ east. As a consistency check, Beijing is at $116^{\circ}$ east. The westernmost part of China is at about $73^\circ$ east (See here). Local noon there is delayed by $(120^\circ - 73^\circ)/(15^\circ/h) \simeq 3h$. So, local noon is a little later than 3pm. This is discounting daylight savings time, which is not currently observed in China. 

Meaning that antimatter would also cause gravitational effects, such as lensing. That would make remote detection of anti-matter quite hard - it would emit and bend light in exactly the same fashion as common matter. Faraday polarization rotation could give us some hope: 

Both are correct, although the first can be further explained a bit. I won't give you a mathematical proof, though; Instead I'll play with characters. Let's assume, for the sake of gedankenexperiment, that: 

On the other side of the question, normal matter has a chance to cool and thus clump together more densely than is possible for dark matter. Hence, small-scale dense environments are dominated by normal matter. 

There are a number of conceptual and numeric problems with your code. They contribute, but I haven't found the conceptual problem yet. I will edit this answer if / when I find it. To start, you set the half-light radius for an exponential profile at 1, create a profile out to 1000, and with a resolution of 1. You need more resolution at the centre, and the last 990 or so bins (probably more than that) are useless. I changed your to 

Fission contributes to keep our internal engine super-hot and well-oiled, allowing for our metallic core to spin and generate our magnetosphere. Eventually we'll run out of heat, the outer core will solidify and stop spinning. 

So the light originating from anti-galaxies would look the same as ordinary galaxies. But what about gravity? A quote from "Isodual Theory of Antimatter: with applications to Antigravity, Grand Unification and Cosmology" may help us further:
