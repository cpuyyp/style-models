In Buddhist meditation you have to do it more in seclusion (Sunyagara, under a tree, etc). There may be other techniques outside Buddhism (at least Theravada) where you may have pratices like this, but this practice does not conform to orthodox way meditation is done. There is the practice of group meditation in certain Centres and Traditions but an healthy distance is maintained between the participants. This can sometimes be beneficial if you are experiencing agitation as near by meditators can influence your peace. 

Prince Siddhartha was insulated from anything that might prompt him from renouncing the householder's life. Not being fully liberate at that point the natural tendency of the mind is to enjoy such experiences. There is no record where he forgot such fate but I would presume that he would have expected to be a Universal Monarch as this is what would have been feed to him constantly. Maha Saccaka Sutta mensions that 

Even when you are enlightened you will have your bodily needs but this is not fueled by greed, hatred or ignorance. 

would be helpful guides. Also you can try to locate a more formal retreat like through: $URL$ or $URL$ which will solve the issue that you do not have a teacher. 

You should be mindful of some of the Vinaya rules like not eating after noon. If you are a lady don't meet the monks alone. When sitting in the presence of a monk choose a lower chair. Remove foot wear inside the monastery. Wear clothes which are modest and cover your self well. No shorts, mini skirts, see through dresses, etc. 

Looking for meaning or lasting influence you are trying to exert some control to you environment which you cannot and lead to misery as if it does not materialise you might think of yourself as a failure. You can try without being too attached to result of your influence. Trying to give meaning to any thing, you are dealing with concepts and perception. Reality will always be different, hence disappointment. So trying to give meaning to anything will not be entirely satisfactory. 

Life does not end with the moment of death. A new birth is taken based on the last thought that came at the time of death. If you it is suicide, the thoughts towards the end of your life are not positive. Therefore your future existence will not be a good one. It will be one of misery and pain. The Buddha taught the realism of how misery arises and the way out of it. By practicing Buddhism you can get out of the pain in this lifetime and the next and also perhaps totally eradicate it. Total eradication happens when you are extinguished, which does not happen through suicide, but through the releasing causality (Dependent Origination, 4 Noble Truths, Conditional Relations). All your problem are not solved at death. Death does not solve any problems but creates more, in terms misery to those you leave behind. The real solution is to understand causality thereby understand how your problems originate and do the needful so that the problems do not arise. You will find the unpleasantness of most of your problems are psychological and can be addressed change of your perspective and outlook of the world. One such change of paradigm is understanding the 3 Universal Characteristic which will intern let you understand causality. Armed with the wisdom of causality your perspective and outlook of the world will change. This means you can keep your mind free from worry and problems. Getting this understanding of causality is not dogmatic or esoteric. the objective of the Buddhist practice is to understand causality so you can overcome your problems, misery or general unsafateryness of life. Anyone who practices Buddhism walks the Noble 8 Fold Path, is the how you find the way out of misery. The method to get the understanding of causality, the method to come out of all your misery or walking the Noble 8 Fold Path is also organised as the 3 Fold Training. 

(Nīvaraṇa Bojjhaṅga) Ahara Sutta The enlightenment facts to cultivate and not to cultivate are as follows: 

This is how some meditation master teach this, but thinking and pondering is verbal fabrication which need also be calmed. [Samma,ditthi Sutta] Also the following might be of interest: Anapanasati: Mindfulness with Breathing - Unveiling the Secrets of Life by Ven Buddhadasa Bhikkhu 

In order to achieve 1, best is to contemplate that everyone must die and it is inevitable. In preparation for 3, 2 will be helpful contemplation and meditation as each breath you take might very well be you last. When you die your mind must be equanimous. This is the target of preparation to die. This can only achived through wisdom by realising the arising and passing away nature of things and realising any worldly phenomena experienced is unsatisfactory and not under one's control to make satisfactory hence let go and be equanimous no matter what your your experience is. 

Any mind state and / or [metal factor][2] create some sensation or the other. These sensations can have some similarities exhibited by the 4 elements like pain (feels like Earth - gross solidified), vibrations, expansion contraction, etc. What is experienced or felt is the mind. Hence there are times you feel the mind is turning to matter and matter into mind. 

See: $URL$ There is a confusion about that is minor or not as no body asked the Buddha for clarification on which rules are the minor rules hence it was decided to keep all the rules. Also see: $URL$ 

As your meditation progresses you will feel sensations both inside and outside, which was covered more in detail in an earlier answer. These sensations depend on Fabrications which manifest itself as pleasant, unpleasant or neutral. As you meditate you might get blissful feeling. Do not get attached to them or dwell too much on the experience. Also the breath is bodily fabrication. When you meditate you bodily fabrication will calm down. Your breath will become so subtle that you might not feel it. Mostly when you see inside your body or this can be just imagination, through if you develop supernormal powers you will be able to do this. In the case you feel inside and outside it is a different case. When this happens you should keep looking until you see arising and passing throughout your body, i.e., you see your whole material body is in a flux of change. Finally do not dwell too much on meditative experiences because you can get carried away and get attached or perhaps averse to them. You have to keep and unattached and clear mind to see things as they are. I.e., you have to keep your mind equanimity at all times. 

The Buddha will always be of a Noble birth and high social status. Not all Buddhas were in the past were princes. This said, the rest of the hypothetical speculation will not hold. 

Main cause of your problems are when you come in contact a sensation arise and you react due to our delusional perceptions which proliferates other sedation to which we react. You liberation is being non reactive to the sensation and reducing pre conditioned reaction. The Buddha cannot subdue perception of another being or indefinitely influence the sensations experienced by another being or influence indefinitely the reaction to sensation of another being. Hence we have to work on our own liberation. 

This is a form of analysing the impermanence of feelings arising from this mental state. It can be taken as Dhamma vicaya which is mindfulness. Basically you look at the arising and passing of sensations pertaining to the hindrance. 

This is possible but anything less than 10 days for you 1st sitting may not give you visible results for an average novice. Also anything shorter may not have the critical push to give results. This is the reason the courses are organised in such away. Also some continuity or length of practice takes you deeper and give better results. Just when you practice playing a game, more frequently you do it better you become. 

You cannot attach a time frame but the shortest part for an average being (without prior practice in a particular type of meditation) is through Anapana. In Nirvana you do not feel the mental pain. In Niroda Samapathi you don't have mental and physical pain. 

Not relevant. As there is no one with absolute power nor are we puppets to some external force. Having said this. We do have some degree of choice in the present moment, which has some degree of influence on the future which hence some level of influence of the future. 

Yes. It is a gradual process where you pass multiple stages before the glimpse of Nirvana and also after until final Arahatship. 

If the person who is subjected to the result of the action has a pure mind then the results are applied may it be good or bad. If I give to a Buddha (very pure mind) with great piety the results would be great. If I do the same for a animal the results will not be that great since the results are not "amplified" due to a lower state of mind the animal has. The Buddha has made great sacrifice to create the Sasana. So if we do something in line with the Buddha's will and intentions then the results would very much greater than any other action. Similarly if we go against it. 

Concept of Moksha is more analogues to birth in a higher plain of existence as per Buddhist Cosmology. E.g. merge with God. Nirvana is to get out of the cycle of birth. The Moksha concept is that you achive the same when you merge with god. 

In Buddhism there is no definiteness in Karma. Since there is not definiteness we can just say there is a higher probability this might happen. 

There is not forbidding of paying respect to deities or Devas. This can be used as a subject of meditation. 

As with any enlightened person (Buddha, Arahath) you cannot get "distracted" after getting enlightened. So no the Buddha would have not got distracted at all. There might have been such cases during the aspirant stages, which in his final birth can be divided into two parts. 

Morality, mastery over the mind, wisdom and release - threefold training (ti,sikkhā) Learning (pariyatti), participating (patipatti) and experiencing (pativedha) Listen / learn, memorise, pratice 

May of the other systems outside Buddhism do not emphasise Morality, Concentration and Wisdom (3 Fold Training) to the extent there is in Buddhism. In many cases it become to develop either morality or concentration. For enlightenment you need all 3 hence Buddhism is the only holistic and balanced systems as per my perspective which can take you to enlightenment. In buddhism you use meditation and concentration as a tool to see reality as it is. This includes understanding of the Dependent Origination, the 3 Characteristics, and the 4 Noble Truths. When practicing Vipassana and start developing the 37 Factors of Enlightenment which include the 7 Factors of Awakening and the 4 Right Exertions you more towards enlightenment. 

One of the benefits of Walking Meditation is that it is also a form of exercise. Depending on how you want to get your exercise there are may way to do it. Going to a Gym or Swimming may not be very appropriate as you cannot be in robes in public / among people. This might be an issue. 

Sacca Vibhanga Sutta and also similar passage is found in (Magga) Vibhaṅga Sutta One of the recurring elements here is putting away covetousness and displeasure in the world which is the task at hand. In addition you have to put effort to that task and also you should not have a lapse of mindfulness when doing this task, otherwise you will not attend to it and perhaps do something else. In short the key elements are awareness, clear comprehension and abandoning craving. Covetousness and displeasure are result of mental reaction to sensations: 

There is nothing as Buddhist vows. But the conduct of Sila for a beginner can perhaps be similar to a vow. Also see: Virtue: Sila 

Gender is temporary and not always present but when it is it is a fact not a mental construction, hence not and illusion, as per my thinking and understanding. 

Pacalā Sutta / Capala Sutta What is discussed here is developing the Perception of a Light like in the āloka kasiṇa to drive away drowsiness. The principle here is if you are in a well lit place or imagine your are drowsiness goes away. 

Meditation clears out your Karma. Past Karma (fabrication) create sensation now. What ever the sensation be equanimous without craving or aversion. 

But when you realize and bring your attention to the sensations they dissappear leaving you in Piti, Suka, Passadhi state. As you do this the arising of distractions will loose vigor and frequency. Concentration on certain points like the upper lip. Upper palate generally tend to create more Piti. (Though not Buddhist concepts concentration on points of the Chakra has a similar effect. See Achan Lee, Thanisaro Bikkhu's manuals also.) Also be aware of the 5 hindrances. The easiest way to do this is to identify the sensations associated with the hindrances. When the come up look at the sensation until it passes away. 

Also note meditating 15 minutes may be inadequate. At least do 1 hour in the morning and 1 hour in the evening / night. If possible more. 

In short this is the chain of cause and effect which keeps up in misery or Samsara. This is in direct relation to our cognitive process. The motivation is to understand this and break the chains in the vicious circle of misery, thus coming out of misery. There may be other cause and effect relationships which do not directly relate to misery (cognitive process) and the way out of it thus not covered in the dependent origination. In the ball analogy there is no misery involved unless you are hitting the ball as part of a sport. In 1st case it is pure physics. If it is as a part of a game the effects of this is our happiness or misery due to our attachment to the outcome as we evaluate it thus effecting our cognitive process. (E.g. the ball go hit into the goal, the goal was missed, a 6 was hit, the ball got hit in the air and was caught, etc. All this relate to the cognitive process which causes misery in Samsara) Also I think Dependent Origination generalised outside the Cognitive Process (Nama Rupa Process), as the general context of it is in this aspect.
