The difference between Ogion’s mode of teaching and that of the School of Wizardry on Roke is a dramatization of the themes of A Wizard of Earthsea. There is a sense in which Ogion stands at the end of the metaphorical road that Ged has to travel in the course of the novel, and so the disagreement between the two of them in chapter 2 prefigures the lessons that Ged is going to learn in the remainder of the story. There are, I think, three parts to this. First, Ogion is an ascetic: he does not value material wealth or fame. Though the folk of Re Albi owe Ogion their lives and property for saving the city from the earthquake, nonetheless his standard of living remains similar to that of the neighbouring farmers and herders: 

The first couplet of this verse is made up of puns on the names of late 19th-century tourist agencies and operators, as described in my answer to Peter Shor’s question. But while researching this answer I noticed that editions of The Seven Seas have different text for this couplet. The original British edition (Methuen and Co., London, 1896) gives the version quoted above (page 135). But the U.S. edition (D. Appleton & Company, New York, 1897) gives this verse as follows (page 119): 

he is simply alluding to the myth, which his audience could be assumed to be familiar with. Theseus fought the Amazons (“woo’d thee with my sword”) and abducted Hippolyta (“won thy love doing thee injuries”). By injuries here Shakespeare means “wrongful actions or treatment” and not necessarily “bodily wounds”. There are psychologically realistic ways to interpret this: perhaps Hippolyta really did fall in love with Theseus and so her abduction was consensual. Or perhaps she is making the best of a horrible situation by allowing Theseus to believe that she loves him. But we can’t expect the text of the play to help us out. Plutarch In the biography of Theseus from Lives of the Noble Greeks and Romans, Plutarch has some trouble organizing the many different versions of the story of Theseus and the Amazons. In Thomas North’s translation (first edition 1579): 

To summarize this paragraph, the argument Woolf is making is that women’s literature expresses women’s experience and inheritance: 

Macbeth's father was actually Findláech mac Ruaidrí (Finlay of Moray). Holinshed describes the prophecy and the Macbeth's death as follows: 

Everyone agrees that Zacynthus = Zakynthos, but how do the others correspond? The problem here is that Homer’s specifications are hard to reconcile: 

A device with multiple revolving disks suggests an orrery (a mechanical model of the solar system which can be used to predict the motions of the planets). Could this be something analogous? 

Copal is an aromatic resin that is burned in central American religious ceremonies, and brassier must be a variant spelling of brazier. Again, this suggests that narrator is native American or has spent time with native Americans. 

(Some manuscripts of the Aeneid have descensus Averno, the descent into Avernus.) This is one of the most well-known passages in the Aeneid, and the descent of Avernus is widely used to mean that it is easy to slide into evil or into disaster, and hard to get out again. The decline in frequency of "Avernus" in the Google Ngram results is just a consequence of the general decline of classical reference. In the 19th century, the Greek and Latin classics were a pillar of the education of the middle and upper classes, hence a natural source of allusions and quotations. Not so much now. 

TL;DR: There is no way to tell. It is a feature of unreliable narrators, that once the reader admits the possibility of their unreliability, there is no firm ground to stand on. If the narrator could be mistaken about one thing, he could be mistaken about anything. The only truth of the matter, after all, is that everything in ‘The Restorer of Reputations’ was invented by Robert W. Chambers, including the narrator. But reading a story as if it were nothing but a collection of lies is deeply unsatisfactory, so it is natural to grope about for some kind of foundation of fact. When reading a story like ‘The Restorer of Reputations’ we have a choice in how to approach the unreliability of the narrator, once it is suspected or established. For example, we might take the narrator completely at his word and make it a story about the rightful king of future America, foiled in his quest for the throne, and unfairly diagnosed as criminally insane. We instinctively shrink from this interpretation, I think, because in this case the subject matter would be vile. But there is nothing in the text that rules out this possibility. (An author might, after all, deliberately write such a story in order to highlight the vileness of its literary tropes, as for example Norman Spinrad does in The Iron Dream. But I’m inclined to think that this is not the case here.) We might, alternatively, decide to interpret direct narration of events as being reliable, while allowing the narrator’s opinions or beliefs to be mistaken. In this interpretation it’s a story set in a future quasi-fascist America whose narrator goes insane due to a fall from his horse and subsequently joins a massive conspiracy run by the blackmailer Mr Wilde. But various aspects of the narrative make this unsatisfactory. For example, the narrator is convinced that his diadem is real: 

Unfortunately Vairement's chronicle has been lost, so we can't trace the story any further. But it is certainly possible that the Scottish and Danish versions of the legend ultimately derive from a common source. In Vairement's day the Western Isles were still (at least nominally) ruled by Norway and it would not be surprising if legends were transmitted from Scotland to Scandinavia or vice versa. 

Confirming this description, Visbhume says that the portals between worlds can only be opened according to a complex schedule: 

TL;DR: Orwell’s ‘good bad’ poetry is ‘bad’ because it is superficial (lacking in aesthetic, intellectual, psychological or moral depth), but ‘good’ because it is skilfully written and enjoyable to read. Orwell’s examples Orwell gave eight examples of ‘good bad’ poems, in addition to the works of Rudyard Kipling. I’ll give four lines from each, but follow the links for the full poems. ‘The Bridge of Sighs’ (1844) by Thomas Hood, about a young woman drowned in the Thames: 

If you search on Google Books for the phrase “Corpo Bacco”, there are (discounting duplicates) only two hits: Kipling’s poem in its U.S. edition, and the poem ‘Camp Song’ from The New Monthly Magazine for May 1853, signed ‘G.W.T.’ (perhaps George Walter Thornbury?): 

Without claiming that this is any kind of definitive survey of the period, I note that although in these passages the reader has to do some imaginative reconstruction, the essential facts of what has happened are clear and the reader isn’t left in any doubt as to whether rape has or hasn’t occurred. 

Waving serapés (Spanish–American shawls) makes sense, but waving carambas does not. Caramba! is a Spanish minced oath, so waving it requires a very loose sense of the word “wave” (or else it is surprisingly rude: caramba is a euphemism for carajo meaning penis). Kipling’s poem constructs an extended conceit between the Victorian three-volume novel (known as a three-decker) and a ship with three decks. Thus the ship is populated with tropes from these novels: “stolen wills for ballast and a crew of missing heirs” and so on. But considered as literary tropes, carambas and serapés seem to belong to Western fiction rather than Victorian melodramas. “Corpo Bacco” looks like Italian for “body [of] Bacchus”, presumably an oath (compare perbacco), but in the context of the replacement couplet it seems to be a kind or brand of tobacco. Is this some kind of joke? 

(Surprisingly, the two lines with the puns do not appear in all editions of The Seven Seas. See my follow-up question for more about this puzzle.) 

None of them convinced me that they had really solved all these points. Fraser has Ithaca = Cephalonia; Dulichium = Corfu; Same = Lefkada and Asteris = Ithaca, but doesn’t explain points 1, 4 or 6. Bittlestone suggests that the Paliki peninsula on Cephalonia was formerly a separate island, but that earthquakes and uplift have since joined them, thus allowing Paliki = Ithaca, satisfying the ‘furthest west’ description, but this doesn’t explain points 4 or 5: if Paliki is Ithaca, then there are no plausible candidates for Asteris. It seems most likely to me that Homer made a mistake somewhere, or that his interpreters have failed to get at the intended meaning. 

* The text has ἀμφίδυμοι (double); some translators prefer this to mean that there were two harbours, rather than one harbour with two entrances. 

* Lucas has “cave” but I think this must be a misread or misprint for “cove” (that is, Lulworth Cove). The tide cliffs are to the west of Lulworth Cove, and there is a path above them that runs, after a mile or so, down behind Durdle Door (pictured below). It is about twenty minutes’ walk. 

The novel goes to describe the wonders and horrors of this infinite ocean, and the emotional and intellectual response of the crew. (You can see some of the author’s early thoughts on this novel on his blog.) 

Rudyard Kipling’s collection The Seven Seas (1896) contains the poem ‘The Three-Decker’, whose third verse is as follows: 

What evidence can we expect? I’ve gone into the question of historicity in such detail in order to show what kind of evidence we might expect to find: Homer might have had personal knowledge of the location and physical geography of Ithaca, or been able to draw on a tradition that described it. However, an important difficulty is that the exact meaning of the text is hard to determine. The language is poetic, allusive, and archaic. A particularly important and troublesome case is Odyssey 9.25–6: 

North’s translation of Plutarch has the same spellings of these names of Theseus’ lovers: Perigouna for Perigune, Ægles for Aegle, and Antiopa for Antiope. Chaucer Shakespeare’s choice of ‘Hippolyta’, rather than ‘Antiopa’ as in North's translation of Plutarch, is likely to have been influenced by Chaucer. In the prologue to the Knight’s Tale, Chaucer gives a brief account of the myth, using the name ‘Ypolita’: 

If the reader were expected to believe that D’Hubert raped the maid, then surely Conrad would have written a description more like this one. The first part of ‘The Duel’ is set in Strasbourg in “a short interval of peace”. A cavalry officer might be reckless about rape in enemy territory during wartime, but it was a different matter in a city in peacetime France where he would risk discovery and court-martial. In particular, after the maid attacks D’Hubert he is worried for his reputation: 

When the pair came up to Céline’s room, Rochester recognized the young man, and believed he was the kind of man likely to have a sexual affair with Céline (a roué is “A debauched or dissolute man; a rake, a libertine, a playboy” [OED]): 

Jeter’s own Morlock Night (1979), a sequel to H. G. Wells’ The Time Machine (1895) in which the Morlocks travel back from the far future of Wells’ story to Victorian London. The Anubis Gates (1983) by Tim Powers, a fantasy combining time travel, Egyptian gods and the English Romantic poets. (The historical part is set in the Regency rather than the Victorian era.) ‘Lord Kelvin’s Machine’ (1985) by James P. Blaylock, set in Victorian Europe and featuring a time machine created by Lord Kelvin. 

(See below for a clearer description of the children’s game somewhat inadequately described in the bracketed paragraph.) Comparing this version with the 1744 version reveals typical signs of oral transmission and improvement: ‘ring’ has been replaced throughout with ‘say’, which better suits the metre; the word ‘slow’ has been inserted into the Aldgate line to improve the rhythm; the archaic reference to Fleetditch (which had been culverted in the mid-18th century) has been replaced by Shoreditch, and the poor rhyme ‘old’/‘Pauls’ has been replaced by the perfect rhyme ‘know’/‘Bow’. In this version, the first two and last two lines stick out as interpolations. The rest of the verse is in accentual dimeter, that is, with two stresses per line, and an irregular complement of unstressed syllables. But the first two lines are iambic tetrameter and the last two lines are dactylic tetrameter. It seems possible that the last two lines in particular came from some other verse, now lost, and became attached to ‘Oranges and Lemons’ somehow. Household Words Volume 9 of Charles Dickens’ magazine Household Words (1851) printed a piece ‘A Witch in the Nursery’ commenting (I think humorously or sardonically) on the imagery of children’s rhymes: 

These passages from Severn have raised two questions for biographers of Keats. First, where exactly are these “splendid caverns and grottos”? And second, how much (if anything) can we read into Severn’s phrase “as though they had been his birthright”? Keats was born and raised in London and there was no evidence that he had any connection with Dorset. Complicating these questions is the problem that Severn is far from reliable—where they can be corroborated, his recollections have often proved to be incorrect. In the passage from ‘My Tedious Life’, “Doncaster” must be a mistake for “Dorchester”, and ‘Bright Star’ was not “the very last poetical effort the poor fellow ever made”—it is now thought to have been composed in 1818 or 1819. What is worse, some biographers have, unconsciously or otherwise, embellished Severn’s accounts. In particular, William Sharp, in The Life and Letters of Joseph Severn (1892), quoted Severn as follows: 

I am not convinced that "mere vessels of happiness" is in fact a "famous image" as claimed by Benatar. If it were famous then I would expect to be able to find more instances of the image using tools like Google Book Search or Google Scholar, but I have been unable to do so. The closest that I have been able to find is in Singer (1981): 

TL;DR: They didn't use the Time-Turner to defeat Voldemort because it would have been narratively unsatisfying. "Time-Turners don't go back that far" does not answer the question. Time-Turners are completely fictional, so they can do whatever Rowling wants. So why not make them go back that far? Rowling's explanation ("if wizards could go back and undo problems, where were my future plots?") is more to the point but it's incomplete. What exactly would go wrong if the future plots were "the wizards use the Time-Turner to defeat Voldemort"? Well, there are at least four things that would go wrong: 

Rochester spied on the pair from the balcony, observing their behaviour when they believed themselves unseen. According to Rochester’s account, they used this opportunity to mock him: 

TL;DR: There is no hidden meaning in ‘Oranges and Lemons’. Tommy Thumb’s Song Book The problem with all the theories about a hidden meaning in ‘Oranges and Lemons’ is that the earliest printed versions do not contain the “chopper” lines. The verse first appeared in print in Tommy Thumb’s Pretty Song Book (1744); I can’t find a facsimile of the original, but archive.org has a reprint from 1815 which has the same text (but with differences in spelling and punctuation): 

Standing at the door, Carraway can hear the butler talking on the telephone, but the words, carried on the faint wind, are hard to understand. “Faint” is a transferred epithet: the sound, as well as the wind, is faint. What the butler really said was: 

which would appear to answer the question, but I prefer to take a different view of the matter, by looking at the way the characters describe their world. (“Infinite are the arguments of mages,” as Vetch says in A Wizard of Earthsea.) Two words that are used many times by characters in the Earthsea novels to describe magical abilities are skill and power (or, less often, strength). The word power in particular occurs more than a hundred and thirty times in A Wizard of Earthsea alone. What exactly the speakers mean by these words is hard to know, but they often appear together as if opposed or contrasted: 

Assuming Rochester’s account to be honest, I think we can reconstruct his reasoning from the details that he included. When Céline arrived at her hotel late that night, she was wrapped in a cloak, which Rochester interpreted as an attempted disguise: 

In Ann Veronica (1909) by H. G. Wells, the newspaper proprietor Ramage attempts to rape the heroine after a dinner but she resists him: 

So let’s call them ‘parentheses’ instead. This particular parenthesis has multiple effects, of which I will limit myself to five. First, it is delightful to read. The prose is almost poetic in places, and there are striking turns of phrase such as the paradox “that you entered those houses which you never entered”. Second, it controls the pace of the story. The parenthesis appears at the start of chapter I of book V of volume II. At the end of book IV Valjean suspected that Javert was close to tracking him down at his lodgings at the Gorbeau house, and took flight with Cosette. It is a tense moment in the plot: the reader is in suspense as to how close Javert has come to a capture, and whether and how Valjean will escape the pursuit. By placing a parenthesis at this point in the text, Hugo pauses the story and prolongs the suspense, making the reader stop and consider what has happened, turning a tense moment into a cliffhanger. (This tactic, of inserting a parenthesis at a tense point in the narrative to heighten the dramatic effect, is one that Hugo uses several times in Les Misérables. For example, at the end of book V Valjean has escaped Javert by climbing over the wall of the convent in the Rue Petit-Picpus, but does not yet know whether he and Cosette will be welcome there. This is followed by two lengthy parentheses: book VI covering the history of the Rue Petit-Picpus, and book VII (itself called “Parenthesis”) analyzing the relation of the convent to French society. Only in book VIII does Hugo return to the drama, so for nineteen chapters the reader has been on tenterhooks about the fate of Valjean and Cosette.) Third, it adds to the verisimilitude of the narrative. By raising the possibility that the descriptions might no longer be correct, Hugo implies, without coming out and saying so, that they are correct with respect to the time in which the novel is set. If we believe that the geography is accurate, then we might find it easier to believe in the events of the narrative. Fourth, it reminds us of Hugo’s exile. The reason why Hugo’s knowledge of the streets of Paris was not up to date was because he had fled France in 1851 after the coup d’état of Louis Napoléon. Although the emperor promulgated a general amnesty in 1859, Hugo chose not to return as that would have meant subjecting his writings to the censorship of the Second Empire. Les Misérables was published in 1862, while Hugo was living in Guernsey. Fifth, it’s a touching expression of Hugo’s feelings of homesickness. When he writes:
