Some background. Whilst car camping down in Weymouth recently I was unfortunate enough to encounter a stomach bug (we initially thought it was food poisoning but later realised it was a bug as my other half developed the same symptoms over 3 days later). I ended up making a mess inside the tent, though not as bad as it could have been (this one was mostly just water). My sleeping bag became unusable however, and this was on the first night, so I slept under a blanket instead, as luckily the weather was still surprisingly warm for September. My other half kindly cleaned up as best he could - the tent seemed to wipe clean ok and was done immediately - but my pack and my sleeping bag took the brunt of the mess. Since we were only there for two nights we just chucked most things effected into the back of the car, but obviously if we had been trekking instead of car camping this would not be possible. My sleeping bag is synthetic and machine washable (as stated by the manufacturer on low heat, no or low spin and only a tiny bit of detergent, no fabric softeners) and now lovely and clean. Again, this isn't exactly something I can manage out on a trek in the future - plus we had plenty of towels with us due to swimming etc, which we probably would not have with us trekking. Also as vomit is a rather nasty thing to clean up anyway, I'm not worried if things get dirty but obviously vomit is completely unhygienic, so I would assume it need something more thorough than a splash in a stream like you do with grubby boots. So my question is: When out trekking, what is the best way to clean camping gear of vomit?

From my personal experience, people either use a double bowline (*) or a double figure 8. The bowline (in my experience!) is used only by fairly experienced climbers, probably because it is more difficult to execute. I will list some pros/cons of the two knots; remind anyway that both knots are absolutely safe to use (as I'm sure is the Yosemite bowline, which I don't know). Double Figure 8 Pros:

This is a question that has bugged me for some time. Some very hard sport routes are very, very long. Some examples: 

My other half used Tyvek when he was practicing Archery and one of the factors there was it had to be quiet, they used it for 4-6 hour stints to sit on. This is what he and some others in his club did: 

Back on my childhood nostalgia train... After thinking about Crabbing I began to wonder if there are any particular sea life that I might have to be wary of when going rock pooling along the coastline? For this, please don't mention litter or various flotsam and jetsam type items, just sea life. Whilst I live in the UK I do travel abroad and love to rock pool throughout my travels so please mention what country you're posting about! For those unsure... Rock pooling is where you discover sea life, shells etc in the water left by low tide. 

The two most famous pioneers of sport climbing of sport climbing in Verdon were the two Patricks: Edlinger and Berhault. I don't know much about the birth of sport climbing in the USA, but this article identifies Smith Rock as one of the birthplaces of this activity:

As far as I know, the "change of paradigm" that led to the birth of sport climbing happened between the 70s and the 80s, and it happened separately in Europe and in the United States. From the early 1900s to the 50s, rock climbing was mostly seen as a "tool" necessary to reach the summit of a mountain. There was no real distinction between "aid climbing" and "free climbing", too: the goal was to reach new summits and to establish new bold first ascents in the mountains, whatever the means. Of course, there were those who advocated a purer climbing style, as for example the german Paul Preuss: 

As your body gets used to the altitude, the symptoms go away. Therefore, if symptoms persist, Yes you should be worried. Altitude sickness can affect your lungs and brain. When this happens, symptoms include being confused, not being able to walk straight (ataxia), feeling faint, and having blue or gray lips or fingernails. When you breathe, you may hear a sound like a paper bag being crumpled. These symptoms mean the condition is severe. It may be deadly. 

I too recommend newspaper however you can also give the following a try: Buy a pack of disposable diapers and empty the sodium polyacrylate into a sock or any fine mesh cloth/bag. Carry it in your pack for any absorption emergency. You should make sure to pack it in a sealed waterproof bag until you need it. Otherwise it will suck the humidity from its surrounding while you carry it! Sodium Polyacrylate is a polymer capable of absorbing 200-300 times it's weight in water. 

Preuss even wrote a series of principles to express his ethics of climbing, criticizing the use of any artificial mean (including the rope) for the progression. However, people like Preuss were rare, and most of the alpinists in the world didn't bother about how a summit was reached, as long as it was reached. The debate about the the ethics of climbing made a return at the end of the 60s and of the early 70s: the advances in technology and the diffusion of the expansion bolt had made possible to climb almost anything, as long as you had enough gear and patience. The excessive use of bolts and artificial means was strongly criticzed, amongst the others, by Reinhold Messner in Italy, who wrote in 1968 the famous article The murder of the impossible and by Royal Robbins in the USA, which described his ideas in the book Advanced rockcraft (1973). Adventure and boldness were still considered prominent in rock climbing, and not much stress was put on technical difficulty. Therefore, using too many artificial means was seen as a betrayal of all climbing was about. Things started to change in the late 70s/ early 80s. In some circles attention began to shift from the heroism of climbing to the technical difficulty. An important step in this process was the invention of modern rubber-soled climbing shoes in the early 80s. 

Wash it on a cotton / white cycle in your washing machine without any soap or detergent or powders. Wash it three times but let it dry thoroughly between each wash. Then if you have a tumble dryer put it on on a standard cycle with three new tennis balls in, this will soften it up further.

Having had horses myself, here in England, part of the reason you give way if you hear a horse coming on a Bridleway is because (and I say this having been in the situation) there is no speed limit for horses on Bridleways (some might have a trot sign but not always), if you're cantering or galloping along which you have every right to do it's harder for us to stop and wait than it is for people to step over. Horses at speed are dangerous to horse, rider and spectator. We giveway to bikers in my area for the same reason, they ring their bell, we move over. Same to joggers. My area in general seems to have an etiquette of slowest mover stops. I admit that is also incredibly rude to gallop past someone, but there is some historic value to that with UK hunts. Dog and Riders trump people and cars when any form of UK Hunt is being undergone. On roads, horses are inherently skittish, but not always. Anything from a plastic bag to a lorry's air brake may but not necessarily will set a horse off, which is why in the UK horses on the road trump cars, cars must slow down and pass slowly, emergency vehicles turn off sirens etc. I once even had armed forces slow their march for us as we rode through their land. Regardless, in the UK as well the rider must make themselves clearly known - high vis is required to walk on our roads, and in general this means you should on a bridleway as well. Part of hacking etiquette around where I am from. In some locations where walkers are common you might also need a license to hack, I've had this in public woodland. In my experience as both horse rider and hiker, it's best for the hiker to step over and wait, and for the rider, whether of horse or of bike, to slow down (if possible) and say thank you ... you will be surprised how many people don't. For the most part around Buckinghamshire, simply being a walker / biker / outdoors person will put you in a sort of polite and thankful outdoors social circle. Many walkers, and various riders, will say 'Good morning / Afternoon' or 'Hello' to you as you pass, and for the most part they remember to say 'Thank you' as well. 

Figure: the south-east face of El Cap. From www.xRez.com The first ascension of El Cap passing through the Dawn Wall was realized in 1970 by Warren Harding and Dean Caldwell after 27 days on the wall (source). The name given to this route was Wall of the Early Morning Light (WEML). Since then, other routes have been established on the Dawn Wall, most notably (source): 

As far as I know, commercially available climbing ropes are max. 80 m (260 ft) long; however, to descend from a 80 m long route, you would need a 160 m long rope! Maybe something less if the route is overhanging, but still much longer that what -as far as i know- is commercially available. So what kind of ropes are used for these "super-routes"? Some kind of "custom" ropes? Disclaimer I know perfectly well (as I've done it myself many times, only on shorter lengths) that it is possible to climb an 80 m route with two 80m ropes (half ropes or twin ropes), then join them together and rappel down for all the 80m. But from the linked videos it is clear that a single rope is being used (see for example Ondra on Chilam Balam). This makes perfect sense, because we are talking about cutting-edge routes, at the limit of modern sport climbing, and carrying two ropes, even if thin half ropes, with all the added weight would probably decrease the performance. 

*According to numbers a 6mm static cord can hold 1600 lbs however I would not recommend using it for the purpose of ascending, let's keep it for hoisting the bear barrels into the trees. If you attempt to ascend a rope using only friction knots please use a safety back up such as the system detailed below! As a safety precaution tie off the slack end of the rope, using a figure eight on a bite, at progressive intervals and clip to your harness. To avoid having a clutter of these knots all hanging off your harness you might choose to untie and release each previous one. Note, however, some climbers prefer the clutter to potentially getting the trailing rope snagged far below. 

It is used to store the sleeping bag, in order to retain the loft. It is not a good idea to store your sleeping bag compressed as small as possible as this will damage the fill. This is very important with down, a little less with synthetic but overall it is crucial to the life of the sleeping bag. A couple things to remember are you want to ensure the bag is dry before storage and it will be stored in a dry area free of excess condensation. You also want to randomly toss it about in the larger storage bag as opposed to rolling it then storing. Rolling up your new sleeping bag will create creases in the same spot over and over and your bag will develop cold spots where the insulation separates as a result of these creases. The most ideal storage is fully laid out and hung, however manufacturers provide a breathable bag of what they have deemed is an adequate size to store the sleeping bag in. 

For someone who has never done it before, what is the best way to start learning how to forage in the UK? Do you require anything specific to start doing this? 

Mealworms and black sunflower seeds are good all year round feeds, used to supplement a birds diet. The type of seed does make a big difference to what is attracted to your garden. 

Weak hooves / easily cracked or damaged, or mentality. Some horses are prone to easily damaging their hooves. We had one pony who had worn shoes his whole life (he was around 14 when we brought him) and when his shoes were removed he had trouble walking and even over a space of 2-3 weeks was so distressed with lack of shoes the farrier had to come out and put the fronts back on (he had to not have rears due to stable rules but he managed fine with just fronts!). Wearing shoes slows the wear and tear horses get on their hooves. Stability. Shoes for domestic / competition horses can come with stud holes. You use studs in bad weather, over the winter, in poor ground conditions. They are little bullet like screw in bits of metal that help the horse get grip in the bad conditions. This makes it harder to walk on the flat but are often used in Cross Country or sponsored rides in the winter seasons. I used these when I competed, when not in use you put a stud plug or some cotton wool in the hole.
