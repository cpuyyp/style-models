While I dont like the throw away and not repair philosophy these days, I would say that 6 patches are more expensive than a new tube. Mine, at 1.50 euro the piece, are not best quality but have been enough for thousands of kilometers. As for patching, I believe that if you patch properly no spoke should move the patch. In any case,the hole should not be unpatchable unless very big. And what about flipping the tube to avoid contact of the spoke and patch, or is it just in the opposite side of the valve? Lastly, I 've found that when patching, leaving the paste solution to dry for some 20 seconds longer than the typical recommended minute helps the patch stick and not move. 

I gather from your question that your reasons for wanting a new stack exchange are that you don't like the kind of answers and vote dynamics from this site. I've been told already this is not a forum, well, this is not a forum. They want concrete questions that can have concrete answers, questions should not be duplicated or easily answered on google, etc (read the FAQ). A new stack exchange would have the same dynamics. There are a number of questions on meta stackexchange addressing perceived hostility on all the different stack exchanges. For a newcomer this type of site can easily feel hostile (down votes, deletions, unability to answer from lack of reputation...), try to get the best out of it, and don't bother trying to change the spirit, for more warm environments you can try bikeforums. 

and keep the cereal bars / banana in the pockets. And to wear just a tight fit tshirt. Because when riding with the road cyclists, I could not help but feel like in a way I'm telling them "stupids" if I can go with older bike, daily clothes and sneakers, and keep up with them, then why the expensive gear?? They were the first to tell me, "don't worry the important thing is the legs", but after a couple of rides I feel like if I want to get regular, I should get the complete set, which I woulddefinitely do if I had more spare money, but, at the point I just refrain from going with them, until at least I equip my bike with cleats. Then I see they are not that much better. Which leads me to peer pressure, and vendor interest in this pressure. I wanted to purchase one of the cycling jerseys they offer in strava for completing a challenge, come on! 140$ ! seriously ridiculous. So I'm sticking to riding alone or with my girlfriend, though I really liked going in a group, a lot faster, getting to know new routes, easier to go farther... it's only that either I get the uniform-proper bike, etc, or I feel very self conscious and uncomfortable for a while. Then again, I see really weak riders riding awesome stuff, and get self conscious again when easily leaving them behind on a climb. Maybe it's me, yes I'm shy, and I don't like to be the center of attention which inevitably you are when you look so different to the rest of the group, if for a minute. But also, to be honest, I am competitive, and love to fill my ego with this underdog turned to be strong things, of course. Well, I don't know, I don't wwant to be peer pressured into buying expensive stuff that will not really make a big difference, I don't want to be regarded as "the one who thinks he's better than us" by riding my crap bike on a tracksuit and sneakers and keeping up, and whatever, possibly this is a non issue, but the truth is after a while, I didn't really came back to the group, which is a pity. I guess I'd rather go to the psychology exhange, or does this happen more than I imagine? Thanks for the patience. It's good to be able to say this to strangers. The question, mainly, would be, do you feel there is a definite peer pressure around this things? or a definite selling interest from shops? have you ridden with no uniform on uniformed groups, or being in a group you have someone without the standard equipment? should I care less? 

Or how does one fall into the road cyclist prototype. I'm talking mainly technology obssesion, spandex wearing and clipless shoes. I start this thread because since riding in a group, I'm questioning the three. I ride an early nineties light steel bike, with no clipless pedals, and I don't have the maillot or pants. I started riding in a group, a couple 100 km rides, and suffered a lot to stay with them, after the ride they told me that clipless pedals would help me stay in the group when they cruise at fast speed. (I was struggling a lot more in the flat than on the hill parts). So I browsed through the pedal/clipless threads here, and came to the conclussion that clipless provides no significant improvement other than keeping the feet on proper place on the pedal. Now, I wear this: 

Because in the flats you reach higher speeds, and at those speeds aerodynamics become very important, so exposing more of your body to the wind is a drag. The standing in flat is then limited to sprint bursts, or just used to give a little rest to your legs and buttock. Whereas going uphill is usually slow so the power advantage you may get standing is worth the trade-off for worse aerodynamics. 

Thanks all for the more elaborate answers, I can't vote up. I see it simpler now. It is the combination of introvertion, wanting to fit in, and the main step to fit in involving a good quantity of money I suppose. So possibly pedals and some clothes would be an intermediate step. My shifters are indexed, though in the frame, not sure the year actually, but from what I collected must be 91 93... Looks like indexed was there earlier than it is thought. My reservation on clipless comes from discussion in this site, tag clipless... Cheers, Gaur 

I also like speed and racing, but after some close calls (nowhere close to yours) I decided to push my limits going UPHILL, go faster in that 17% climb where 10 mph is the speed of light. And outside of bicycles, there are infinite challenges, running a mile under 5 minutes, learning to swim butterfly, or in strength training, going for the gimnastic bodyweight type, planches, handstand, rings and iron cross, you name it... 

You only have three options: to trust other cyclists behind you, or slow down and let them pass you, or accelerate, when riding with unknown people. It will happen eventually with other riders and I would say that the only choice is to have a bit of trust and actively check before any stopping or turning. Just like you do in a car or motorbike, and signal said turns or stopping. It does not seem practical to talk to everyone on your tail. Have a bit of trust, nobody wants a crash. Just be aware of your environment and avoid abnormal movements. I mean, this is what we do everyday, trust that other people will control their vehicles, and keep attention focused when o the road 

From what I've read, adding a power meter betters measuring HR only, for some reasons: Heat, diet and stress can affect your HR. A low HR might be an indicator that you are in good shape. You can have a high HR and your power output be low An increase in power implies better performance, but an increase in HR does not necessarily. So it is good to combine both for serious training, to determine you are getting good: Low HR and normal or high power compared to previous training would mean good condition. High HR and high power would mean you're still getting better Low HR and low power would mean problems. So, HRM tells you about the workload your body is sustaining, while power meter tells you about how is your body performing. Having a record of how your power output evolves through your training season would be more useful than knowing your HR. You can establish some power output you want to reach, and some days you'll get that power with less or more HR. (Concepts taken from the book The Cyclist's Training Bible by Joe Friel, which mentions a book on the subject: Training and Racing with a Power Meter by H. Allen and A. Coggan) 

Easy but you need a special tool for extracting the gears, and there is not a standard one, brands have different, it is a job for a bike shop, I'm afraid, but should be inexpensive 

I am in the same bandwagon, being dropped at high speed flat cruising, though I was looking for different suspects (pedals, clothes...). For aerodynamics I would expect having broad shoulders or narrow, for instance, to have more effect than what road - CX differences can imply. Even wider handlebars would have more significance than frame geometry differences (between road and CX that is) Since you say that you have similar power output, it could be performance when approaching or being in a glycogen depletion state. I have marked this as the main reason of my dropping out the bunch, not sure if it can apply to you but think if the riders you go with are more used to long (60 miles and more) rides, and what is your average riding distance, and specially, can you follow them OK the first part of the ride or is it a no no from the beggining? 

From this question and the other regarding clothes, I think that you would be better off showing the bike or bikes you are referring to when using the term "road bike". Possibly you are not talking of a road bike like this: 

I think it all depends on the use you are going to give the bike. I've owned nothing but older bikes (road) since I resumed cycling around 2006, mostly for commuting and occasional longer rides (on the lines of 5.000 km / year) and everything has been ok. What I would do is try and find some old bike that works fine, and not get into the upgrade thing; if you are going to change stuff, better get a new one, because it is so easy to get entangled in an upgrading trend. 

Researching on this myself, the main reasons I've found is that more surface (road) is better for power transmission and more comfortable on longer rides, which you would also want on MTB but road cleat can be inutilized with mud or just natural soil not tarmac, so you could have problems stepping with road shoes on a MTB track terrain then trying to reclip with stuff inside cleat. There seem to be also range of motion (lateral?) issues, better on MTB pedals but not so needed in road. 

Well, if you did your own preliminar fit, it is time to tweak it based on how you feel. You don't mention if you are using clipless pedals, but if you do, those can be a source of knee problems even when the rest of elements are roughly well fitted. From experience, I have noticed that people doing their own fit tend to have the seatpost a tad high, because this is something that gets remarked a lot and in making sure it is high enough we usually overdo it, if just for a little. So, a centimetre or even less of adjustment of the seat height or sliding it forward or backwards in the rail, can make the difference between pain / discomfort or a pain free ride. Go for a ride with your tools and see how slight modifications affect your riding, but it is an ongoing experience, since even with a professional fit you may need tweaking, more so with your own fit. I kind of start listening to my body and have changed my cleat position like 6 or 7 times in a year, always getting a bit better. Saddle tilt is also something to pay attention to. All in all, if you don't want to go for a pro fitting session, experiment and note down what your body says in order to make or keep changes. Again, even a slightest tune up can make up for a change you wouldn't imagine. Remember that easier gearing is also easier on the knees, pedalling cadences of around 90 are recommended, and having good support muscles will also help your knee so work them a bit, like walking upstairs, riding other bikes without cleats.. there are many exercises for strengthening the knee area, even dreaded squats. Experiment, don't take the first fit as the definitive fit ! 

This is very location dependant, but police may remove it for you whithout charge, specially if it is locked to public urban furniture. (I know a friend of mine got his bike back this way after losing his keys) Of course you would need that proof of ownership. 

Well, the usual argument is that an average person can easily lose one or two kilos of body weight, and that would cost good money if you take it from the bike. On my experience, weight is more noticeable when riding uphill, but then, if you usually ride uphill I don't think you would want a single speed. Other issue would be speeding from a stop, or starting a sprint from a lower pace, but again, on a single speed you already have a problem with that, specially speeding from stop (or if your single gear is short, maintaining high speed for a good stretch, the eternal tradeoffs) I rather start in a short gear with 5 kilos more and then switch to longer gear if we were to race 100 meters, or from a light stop to another, than on a single gear. I don't know, if you want speed, gearing seems to me a lot more important. On long stretches you could use longer gear. Then, if we are comparing same gear ratio on same frame geaometries and handlebars, for the same cyclist, of course you want less weight, but is it worth the money? I don't think so. All in all, if you were to magically create a clone of yourself, and race against him in the same magic bike, but one is 15 kilo and the other 7.5, and all conditions are magically the same, wind, body placement, whatever, physics of this planet will make the lesser weight bike faster. Is it worth it? that's up to you, and more specially to your cash availability. If you want an opinion, it is not, I ride a road bike and a mountain bike, the mountain bike must be 3x the weight of the road, and still, I ride a lot of Strava segments that I did faster on the mountain bike (it's got no suspension though). So, yep, hunching like an egg and saying to yourself I'm going to pass that guy on the scooter or die trying, that can be more relevant to speed than triple weight. And of course, having bottom bracket destroying hams is #1 in the speed equation... sometimes I wheelie from the sheer power, in a 52-13 ratio :D Really, diss weight and get some bike you fancy, and ride it fast if that's what you like. But don't put yourself or others in danger knowingly. edit: only top speed?:
