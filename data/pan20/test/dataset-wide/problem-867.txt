All true. Think of a single point explosion, at any given time, the object twice as far should be moving twice as fast, cause they both started in the same place at the same time, so twice as fast moves twice s far. There are, complications - with the explosion there's air resistance, with the universe well, I'll get to that. 

Source The big ear measured total signal variation between the disks every 12 seconds, so it wouldn't detect Amplitude or Frequency variations that would happen in much shorter intervals than 12 seconds. We simply have no way of knowing. Another possible method to transmit a information could perhaps be polarization variation in a consistent signal, but big ear couldn't pick that up either. The problem is, we simply don't have enough information to know. It's like somebody snapped a terrible picture of something that might have happened. You can look at the picture forever, but it will never give you any new information. More on it here, and I liked this article here. Hope that wasn't too wordy or too much already known information. 

A pretty good site for quick explanations is the Particle Adventure Anti Matter Dark Matter Anti Matter is really quite simple and very similar to regular matter. It just happens to explode violently when it touches regular matter - like a positron (Positive Electron) and an electron (negative) will touch and evaporate into a pair of gamma rays. The Proton/anti Proton or Neutron/anti Neutron or Proton/antineutron or Neutron/antiProton (they interact because they have some quarks/anti-quarks in common). Those reactions are more complicated, but the gist is the same. They explode violently when they touch. So, because matter and anti matter tend to evaporate each other, there's really no primordial anti-matter left in the universe, cause there was slightly more matter. But, other than the explosive interaction, Antimatter is almost exactly the same as matter, You could, in theory build a star, a planet, trees and life out of anti-matter. Dark Matter is a lot more different. We don't really know what it is, but it's a different kind of matter, it's transparent and it's non binding but it has mass. Regular matter can bind together gravitationally, that's why it forms into things like stars, planets, comets, asteroids, etc. Dark matter doesn't do that. It loosely collects around galaxies, or, perhaps more accurately, galaxies collect inside large pockets of dark matter. 

How long a ring system lasts depends on a few factors. How big it is, whether it's given new material regularly or not, what it's made of and how vulnerable it is to the sun's rays. Saturn's rings, for example, are losing material, raining down on Saturn as well as slowly adding material from Enceladus, one of it's small and close moon's that gives up ring material by tidal-volcanic eruptions. Earth's large moon could (not saying it would but it might) play a role in disrupting and Earth-Ring system more quickly than it would with no moon. A 2 body system with the 2nd body as large as the moon isn't gravitationally friendly to other orbiting objects. Many man made satellites orbit well within the Roche limit but they are small enough to be held together and not be affected by tidal forces. Larger objects, just a few miles across, perhaps less, are more vulnerable to tidal forces and tend to break up inside the Roche Limit. 

To properly answer this question, you should apply the 3 body problem, which, gets very long and mathy. It's technically not solved but it can be approximated with very good accuracy. Applying basic Newtonian formulas can give you an estimate. The sun has about 1,048 times the mass of Jupiter, and if we line up Mars at it's Aphelion (1.67 AU) to Jupiter at it's Perihelion, (4.95 AU). Mars at it's furthest and Jupiter at it's closest, Mars is still about twice as close to the Sun as it is to Jupiter. For simplicity, I'm going to call Mars at Aphelion an "MAU" - Mars Aphelion Unit, so Mars, furthest from the sun, 1 "MAU", Jupiter closest to Mars, about 2 "MAU" and Jupiter closest to the Sun, 3 "MAU" So, in perfectly lined up conditions, Jupiter never has more than 1/4,000th the gravitational pull on Mars than the Sun does and we also have to factor in the tidal force. It gets tricky here, cause all 3 objects exert a force on the other (or stretch space time which tells the objects where to go if you like the relativity version), but I'm going to stick with forces. Jupiter tugs on Mars and the Sun at the same time so how far it pulls Mars from the sun is more of an an applied tidal force. At closest point, Jupiter's tug on Mars from 2 "MAU" and it's tug on the Sun from 3 "MAU" means it tugs on Mars 2.25 times stronger. Take the inverse, the effective gravitational pull - at closest, is the inverse of that, or 44%, so you can only apply 56% of Jupiter's gravitational pull towards Mars relative to the sun. And that's at peak. As Mars moves closer to the sun and/or further from Jupiter that number drops. The effect of Jupiter on Mars orbit relative to the sun is never more than about 1 part in 7200 of that of the sun. As Mars moved towards Jupiter in it's orbit it speeds up and effectively moves away from the Sun, and as it moves away from Jupiter, this effect is largely cancelled out over time. In effect it's a slight stretching when moving towards Jupiter and squashing when moving away, of Mars' elliptical orbit every time around the sun. These are sometimes called orbital perturbations. 1 part in 7,200 works out to about 0.14% and that's the peak Jupiter effect. Rounding down, a .01% variation on Mars' orbit seems a plausible estimate and that might even be a little high. Applying that to the diameter of Mars' orbit, that works out to a stretching/squashing of about 20,000 to 25,000 km. Compared to Mars natural variation based on it's eccentricity of over 26 million miles, that's pretty insignificant. This stretching and squashing is also largely balanced out as Jupiter circles around the sun. Now if we apply the acceleration formula, I get a somewhat different number. g = G*M/r^2. Gravitational Constant: 6.67E-11 Mass of Jupiter 1.898E27 kg r = distance between the two. Closest pass is about 3.28 AU, or 4.91E11 meters The peak gravitational acceleration Mars feels from Jupiter is about 5.26E-7 m/s^2. That sounds negligible, but Mars takes 187 days to orbit the sun and it spends about half that time closer to Jupiter than the Sun is to Jupiter. As a (bad) estimate, because that's the maximum gravitational force at closest pass, if we estimate that over a Mars year, that works out to about 90 days of "falling" towards Jupiter and 90 days falling away. Obviously the period is longer than 90 days but the force is less when Mars is further away so that's a guestimate. Apply (d=1/2at^2) to 90 days or about 7.8 million seconds. The distance using that formula comes to about 16,000 km. So, both estimates are pretty close, one of 16,000 the other of 20-25,000 km. This also works well with the 4 or 5 significant figures usually given for Mars' obit. 4 figures on distance works out to nearest 100,000 km, which wouldn't be affected by Jupiter's stretching and squashing of Mars' orbit. Now as for Saturn, at 30% the mass of Jupiter and roughly twice the distance from Mars and the Sun, you're looking at less than 8% of the gravitational force and with tidal effects figured in, maybe just 4%-6% the orbital perturbations. Jupiter is the one that really matters. Orbital stretching and squashing is what lead to the discovery of the planet Neptune, because astronomers noticed that Uranus orbit was effected in a similar way to how Jupiter affects Mars. Observing those perturbations told them about where to look for Neptune and it was found not long after. I want to point out that over tens of thousands of orbits, these perturbations can lead to changes in Mars' orbit, primarily it's eccentricity. It's semi-major axis and period of the orbit remain mostly unchanged, but it's eccentricity operates on two cycles. Mars' eccentricity varies on a 96,000 year and a two million year cycle. Like Mars, Earth's eccentricity also has cycles driven by the other planets, 95,000, 125,000 and 413,000 years. Mars' eccentricity is prone to greater variation, presumably (I think) because it gets closer to Jupiter. As a rule, these eccentricity oscillations move back and forth unless two planets end up in resonance with each other. When that happens the variations can continue to grow leading to significant movement of one or both of the planets over millions of years. This is more likely to happen shortly after the solar-system forms. Our solar system is thought to be long-term stable with no orbital resonances between planets now, and none expected for at least a couple billion years. There's a small chance that Jupiter and Mercury will fall into resonance in a few billion years. Here's a nice detailed article on orbital eccentricity variation and stability of the solar system. That's a ballpark answer anyway. Corrections to my math are welcome and if anyone can do the 3 body problem, feel free. That would be much more accurate, but I think 16,000 - 25,000 km per orbit is in the ballpark. 

Apologies for the long answer, but I wanted to point out that an unnoticed, very fast effect is theoretically possible, just hugely improbable. 

When the Moon is waning its moving towards the sun and any pressure from the sun slows the moon down, (a tiny bit) and that slow-down moves the Moon closer to the Earth which speeds it up even more - funny how that works, pushing to slow something down in orbit and it goes faster - but that's how it works, cause potential energy converts to kinetic as the orbit drops, kinda like how falling makes things go faster. When the Moon is waxing, it's moving away from the sun and any pressure from the sun speeds it up which moves it away from the earth and that in turn, slows it down. So that's your answer in a nutshell. The solar pressure doesn't push the moon away from the sun so much as it pushes the moon into a lower and then higher orbit around the Earth depending on where the Moon is in it's orbit around the Earth and the various positions in both the Moon's and Earth's elliptical orbits. The overall effect is very difficult to calculate and I suspect it could go either way depending in part on the timing of large coronal mass ejections hitting the moon and in part on any possible resonance between the eccentricity of the Moon around the Earth and the Earth around the sun, er, I think. What is safe to say is that the Earth-Moon system obeys the same surface area to mass ratio the Earth alone because that's simple momentum which needs to be conserved. The Earth-Moon system has a combined surface area of 1.074 Earths and a combined mass of 1.012 Earths, so the Moon being in the Earth-Moon system makes the Earth move away due to solar pressure about 6% faster. 15 CM to 15.9 CM. Not a very big change, and it's possible that the 15 CM estimate is based on the Earth-Moon barycenter not the Earth itself. So, the effect is more of a wobble in the Moon's orbit around the earth than an actual force that pushes the Moon away from the sun faster than it pushes the Earth away. All this, is, of-course, unimportant compared to the much bigger solar tidal force on the Earth-Moon system. As the Moon gets closer to the sun (new moon in the picture above) The sun effectively pulls the Moon a little bit away from the Earth and when it's further from the sun (full moon), The Moon is effectively pulled towards the earth. The net effect of this solar tide is a measurable wobble in the Moon's orbit around the earth. The effect on the Moon's orbit around the earth due to photon pressure and coronal mass ejection pressure - basically insignificant. Hope that's clear.
