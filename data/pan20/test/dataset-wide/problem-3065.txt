This stockpile was transferred directly from the Congo to the United States at the end of 1940, and provided the initial supply of uranium for the American atomic bomb project. Meanwhile, about 1200 tonnes of uranium in various compounds stored at the Olen refinery was captured by the Germans after the invasion of Belgium in 1940, only to be recovered in Germany by US troops at the end of the war. So yes, there was a lot of Uranium in Belgium, waste from their decades of Radium manufacture from ore mined in their colonies and shipped to the home country as ore rather than refined on site (which was typical of the way Belgium and France ran their colonies, stripping them of raw resources rather than creating manufacturing in situ and shipping out the finished products, as was done to a large extent by the Dutch and British. 

Quite a few countries with bad water are also countries ruled by rather aggressive religious regimes that ban the drinking of alcohol, and will go so far as to behead or stone people found in posession of it. In such an environment, beer is simply not openly available. Which doesn't mean people don't drink it, it just goes underground, like the production and consumption of hard liquor did in the USA during prohibition. For example on several islands I visited in Indonesia there's not a drop of alcohol to be got, unless you know where to go (which the locals seem to know quite well). And in Indonesia they're far less violent against those caught drinking than in places like Yemen. 

For the problems faced with tunneling assault tunnels that have to remain undetected for extended periods, look at North Koreas tunnels across the DMZ, and at Hamas' and the Mexican drug cartel's tunnels into Egypt, Israel, and the USA. The DPRK uses heavy machinery to make tunnels large enough to drive tanks and trucks through, which takes years for each tunnel to complete. And the South Koreans have got pretty good at finding and destroying them. Hamas and the druggies make narrow, dank little tunnels that often you can't even walk through but have to crawl. And those too are often detected and destroyed quickly. They too have powertools, but no heavy construction equipment. 

You'd say after 70 years almost it's time to let matters rest and for each to recognise the independence of the other. 

Communism sets to replace religion as well as national identity with itself. Pan-Arabism sets to establish religion (Islam) and a single regional (if not necessarily national) identity, Arab culture. Thus the two are like fire and water, they can't possibly coexist in the same sphere of influence and not be at odds. 

All depends on the aircraft, development went very quickly during WW1. In the early days it was indeed a very precarious business, aircraft were very new and nobody really knew what they were doing. As a result new designs were pushed into service that were indeed unstable, very unreliable, and put in the hands of people who had little or no training or experience. Accident rates were high, accounting for far more losses than did enemy action. But over the years things improved massively until at the end of the war we could see aircraft as reliable and stable as those of WW2, long range bombers that could reach Germany from the UK with a reasonable weapons load, patrol aircraft to scour the north sea for German U-boats, and shortly after WW1 ended there were the first scheduled air mail deliveries between Europe and the USA using converted bombers (with extra fuel tanks and reduced weight from removing weapons). Aircraft like the HP V/1500 $URL$ with 17 hour endurance, not at all comfortable to spend that long on the hard wood and leather seats in an open cockpit, wind howling and engines screaming all around you... And that was probably the real limit of what could be achieved, human endurance, until the advent of enclosed cabins made possible by increased engine power per kilo of mass during the 1930s. p.s. The Vickers Vimy was used to set world records crossing the Atlantic: $URL$ 

The European "standard" I've indeed heard was based on Borgia's representation, and with the large scale sending of priests around the world from Europe in the colonial era probably influenced at least at some level depictions elsewhere. 

And if you'd lived your life in the Republic of China you'd have learned that Taiwan is an independent nation, the one true China, and that the rebel government in Beijing is illegally in power there (that may have been toned down now, but that used to be the line in the ROC). Both are of course propaganda. 

Eventually the civilian population would have started taking up the mining and other hard labour jobs as more and more people ended up in the colonies who lacked other skills (including former transportees of course) and instead of calling for more transportees there came to be resentment towards them taking up jobs that colonists could do as well and with no need for armed guards. That's btw also a reason to abandon slavery, unemployment among poorly educated people who start seeing jobs they could do performed by slaves instead. 

Many (maybe even most) events were free entrance, the entire cost covered by the sponsors (usually politicians, emperors, generals seeking influence, sometimes merchants). Seating was assigned based on social status rather than how much one could pay, the better seats going to the higher ranking members of society (and better could mean closer to the imperial lounge rather than better view of the arena). 

pretty much, yes. Set up camp, play loud music over the walls, send out parties to pillage and loot the surrounding countryside for supplies and to hunt for attempts at tunneling under your camp), if possible maybe rotate out part of your forces with fresh ones from home. It's a game of chicken basically, who has the most patience and resources, with the besieged city hoping to get relieved, the besieging army hoping they don't run out of places to loot for supplies. 

as a Kommissar his main duty would have been enforcing morale and adherence to proper party doctrine. IOW he was a political officer, not too dissimilar (except he would have authority to shoot people for not being properly enthusiastic) to a chaplain in the US army. As a KGB officer, he would also be involved (as you mention) in interrogation of POWs and "dissident elements" (iow, Soviets found to be improperly patriotic or suspected of other "crimes" like retreating in the face of enemy fire). Not the kind of person you would want to make an enemy of, and precisely the kind of person a propagandist would want to see closely associated with a young, good looking, highly patriotic, and very successful soldier who is soon to be elevated to the status of national hero in a time that the country needs national heroes to keep its collective morale up in a war that isn't going exactly as planned. Saying that he was tasked with planning the city's defense is probably technically correct, but in reality that task would be squarely on the head of Yeryomenko, Khruschev being his link to the Party and ensuring that the operation was executed according to proper Party doctrine and with the right amount of communist zeal. 

traditionally, Europeans were told what to believe in, Americans came to American to believe in things of their own choosing. Of course this is not wholly the case any more, many European countries are as religiously liberal as the US are now. But a strong monoculture exists in those countries still, with the majority of churches being of a specific denomination. 

It's certainly not inconceivable that it would happen, especially during sieges. But do keep in mind that it would require reasonably similar bows between the different armies. If the English were using longbows requiring 1 meter long arrows and the French were using crossbows using 30cm long bolts for example, there'd be no way to reuse those (though a Frenchman might in an emergency be able to break a recovered English arrow in pieces and shoot off those, without fletching it would be highly inaccurate). THAT makes it unlikely in the case of especially the mentioned English longbow which was a pretty specific weapon not used AFAIK by anyone else. 

I've never heard of any such requirement, and I guess it would have been listed in one of the many books I've read about the era (including German ones from WW2 and the 1930s). I doubt it would even be needed to set such a requirement. The Partei was extremely popular, especially among the well educated, and seeing more government contracts coming the way of competitors who were Partei members would be enough incentive to persuade the rest (and seeing totalitarian regimes through the decades it is the norm to send contracts the way of your supporters, so it's no great leap to assume the Nazis did the same). 

The Netherlands mostly was active in the area to hurt the flow of gold and other riches to the coffers of their European enemies, the islands (and coastal forts) they took were a side effect of that more than anything. In part the same can be said for a lot of what the French and British did in the Caribbean and South America, they were all at war with Spain, Portugal, and each other in various combinations of alliances for centuries and this was reflected in whose buccaneers and privateers attacked whose ships on the high seas, raided which islands and towns. Later those privateers were largely drawn into the active armed forces of the nations involved, the towns being brought under the control of their respective governments rather than being run by private interests (like the Dutch and British West Indies Companies, and sometimes groups of pirates). The Surinam was never conquered by the Dutch, it was acquired in trade with the British who sold it to the Dutch in payment for Manhattan Island (which they renamed from New Amsterdam to New York in the process). 

And what was "average"? The treatment of slaves varied wildly in time and space, depending on function, market conditions, etc. etc. Someone's personal servant would be treated better than some random farmhand, whether free or slave for example. And over time imports became rarer, thus prices higher, leading to more benefits in treating them better so they'd live longer. Ditto with slaves more than minimally trained/skilled at their jobs. They were valuable commodities, just as senior staff are valuable now and paid better than interns. It's simple economics, if they die before earning more than the cost of purchase and upkeep you've run a loss on your purchase. So you want to treat them well enough that they stay alive and can work a decent job, but not so well that they eat up all the money they earn you. Again, the same as companies and how they treat their staff now, especially in industries where there are far more people looking for jobs than open positions (and thus quitting your job is risky and companies can get away with offering poor conditions because there's always someone willing to accept them over social security or unemployment money). 

One thing that could (and at times has) caused things to seemingly slow down is the requirements for ever larger teams and investments needed to make new discoveries. It was quite possible for Christian Huygens to design, fund, and create his first microscopes. For the person coming up with the idea for the electron microscope that was already a lot harder. And to build a cyclotron on your own is just about impossible unless you happen to be a rather affluent person with advanced skills in many fields. But overall, it holds true that more people can get more done in total in amount of time than a smaller group. 

Initially, the Roman army was made up mostly of farmers with no long military training. Go look at farm hands in any "primitive" society today (meaning a farm without major mechanisation) to see what such guys look like. No "six pack", which is pretty much a late 20th century US beauty ideal and little else, but muscular and strong overall. 

If you mean companies that are currently IT companies, and created and sold equipment explicitly for the purpose of use in the holocaust, that'd exclude any company outside German occupied Europe, Spain, Italy, Sweden, and Switzerland, as there simply was no trade during the holocaust years with Germany from anywhere else. 

Most of the great wall was never assaulted, was more symbolic than anything. Most of the rest only ever had to deal with small groups of roving/semi-nomadic brigands, not organised armies. And to tunnel under something like the great wall in such a way as to not draw attention to your efforts you'd need a pretty large group of tunnelers, and start at a considerable distance from the wall. Another factor to consider is that a lot of the wall (and all the pieces that were actually potential targets for larger invading groups) were/are situated in mountainous areas. You'd have to tunnel through solid rock, not soil. While easier to hold a tunnel, it also is very hard labour, especially without heavy machinery. You'd end up with a tunnel that'd not be capable of infiltrating a sizeable force quickly, meaning you'd have to make it even longer to end up in an area where the defenders are unlikely to see you emerging and setting up camp for days or weeks in order to get all your forces through the tunnel before starting the assault. 

A line was drawn on a map during a conference between Stalin, Roosevelt, and Churchill. That line was intended to divide Germany into pieces according to a division of power the three had agreed upon. The line was drawn to follow some natural boundaries like rivers and lakes, and that's about it. Not culture, politics. And not even German politics. 

A lot of people are right now following George Orwell's 1984 as a manual for what the perfect society should look like and implementing it in various countries all around the world. Same with Marx's Das Kapital, that's been used like that for a century or more. 

The first weapon was a rock or stick used by one proto-human to bash another over the head... And we've been getting every better at it ever since. No country needed, though with the cost of large scale weapons development in the 20th century (or really from the Roman era) it certainly helps to have the resources of a country at your disposal.
