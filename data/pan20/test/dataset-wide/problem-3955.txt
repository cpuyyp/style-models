Andre Gramain's 1992 exposition of van Kampen's statement is in fact covered explicitly in "Topology and Groupoids", as it was in the 1988 version of that book; it was just an exercise in the 1968 edition. The point of this type of exposition is to say that sometimes a group can be better explicitly described in terms of groupoids. A basic example is the group $\mathbb Z$ of integers! This is obtained from the groupoid $\mathcal I$ which has two objects 0,1 and exactly one arrow between them by identifying 0 and 1. This is rather analogous to the way the circle is obtained from the unit interval $[0,1]$ by identifying 0 and 1 ! Another aspect is that sometimes a groupoid is a better object to deal with than a group. For example, a homotopy colimit of a diagram of groups is really a groupoid. This is analogous in topology to taking double mapping cylinders rather than a pushout of maps of CW-complexes. For more information on the book see $URL$ I should also say the Higgins' monograph has results on groups, for example a generalisation of Grusko's theorem, that has not been equalled by other methods. Another aspect of Topology and groupoids is Chapter 11 on "Orbit spaces, orbit groupoids", which allows some computation of the fundamental groupoid and hence group of an orbit space. 

It should be said that van Kampen's paper "On the connection between the fundamental groups of some related spaces". Amer. J. Math. 55 (1933) 261--267, gives a formula for the case of a union of two spaces with non-connected intersection, and this was needed for his work on algebraic curves: "On the Fundamental Group of an Algebraic Curve". Amer. J. Math. 55 (1933), no. 1-4, 255â€“267. The non-connected case seems to me best handled in modern terms using groupoids. (See my web pages.) (An earlier version of the theorem in the connected case and for simplicial complexes was given by Seifert.) Since homotopy groups are mentioned in the last comment, I mention the higher order theorems of the Seifert-van Kampen type of which the 2-d version was given in my paper with Philip Higgins , ``On the connection between the second relative homotopy groups of some related spaces'', Proc. London Math. Soc. (3) 36 (1978) 193-212. This uses extensively the notion of crossed module, and has been applied to give explicit calculations of homotopy 2-types, and second homotopy groups. (Again, see references on my web pages). In view of the provenance of van Kampen's paper, it would be very interesting to know if such higher theorems are applicable to the situation of the question. @Kevin Kordek: September 2013: I should add that Grothendieck was interested in these possibilities. See the last problem stated in the set of problems and "Future directions?" given in our new book on "Nonabelian algebraic topology"; more details and pdf's available from here. Part of his comment is as follows: "It seems to me, in any case, that this $\underset{\to}{\lim}$-operation ["higher order van Kampen theorem"] in the context of homotopy types is of a very fundamental character, with wide range of theoretical applications. To give just one example, relying on the existence of such a formalism, it is possible to give a very simple explicit algebraic description of the full homotopy types of the Mumford-Deligne compactifications of the modular topoi for complex curves of given genus $g$, say, with $\nu$ "marked" points, in terms essential1y of such a (finite) direct limit of $K(\pi, 1)$-spaces, where $\pi$ ranges over certain "elementary" Teichm\"uller groups (those, roughly, corresponding to modular dimension $\leq 2$), and to give analogous descriptions, too, of all those subtopoi of the previous one, deducible from its canonical "stratification" at infinity by taking unions of strata. In fact, such descriptions should apply to any kind of ``stratified" space or topos, as it can be expressed (in an essentially canonical way, which apparently was never made explicit yet in this literature) as a (usually finite) direct limit of simpler spaces, namely the "strata", and "tubes" around strata, and "junctions" of tubes, etc." So I probably missed out on not pursuing this, partly because of pursuing work with J.-L. Loday on even more powerful Higher van Kampen type theorems. 

There are some conversations on the affine Weyl group cells perspective of the bijection. I guess I can contribute a very little bit on the primitive ideals side of the story, if it is not too late to do so. My first encounter of the Lusztig's quotient comes from the paper of Barbasch and Vogan in 1985 (here). It is mainly about finding the (g,K)-modules of a fixed infinitesimal character whose annihilators are the 'largest' possible primitive ideal, which Barbasch-Vogan called 'special unipotent' as in the title of the paper. These special unipotent representations have a lot to do with the ring of regular function of a nilpotent orbit, R[O]. This is first hinted in Section 12 of Vogan's work (here). And Vogan's version of the above bijection is about the structure of R[O], as mentioned in the Achar-Sommers paper. I have carried out some computations on the bijection from this perspective (effectively I can prove a conjecture in the paper). But talking about why Vogan's version of the bijection matches with that of Lusztig's, I think Barbasch and Vogan know much more about it. 

I am looking for some references about irreducible representations of the Weyl Group over simple Lie Groups, both classical and exceptional ones. In particular I want to know the dimensions and the character tables of the irreps. I heard of those Mackey theory for a while (which should be helpful for the Weyl group over classical simple Lie Groups), but I failed to find some nice references for it. It will be very helpful if there is a nice account on the theory. 

1) An example is the metapletic representation in the complex symplectic group. They have half-integral infinitesimal characters, and the wavefront set is the minimal orbit which is non-special. 2) Check out the book by Monty McGovern (here). In Section 5. He mentioned how to find out the wavefront set/associated variety (which are the same by a deep theorem of Schmid and Vilonen) for $U(g)/J(\lambda)$, where $\lambda$ can be any infinitesimal character. 

This may sound like a very general question, which pretty much reflects my ignorance on the subject. In the case of Weyl groups $W$, there is a notion of left/right/double cells, which is roughly some partitions on the elements of $W$. It turns out that these cells afford representations of $W$ (or $W \times W$ in the case of double cells). The structure of these cells are well-known, for example in the case of $W = S_n$, the partition of cells is related to the Robinson-Schensted algorithm. There are applications of cells in other aspects of mathematics. Due to my ignorance of the subject, I will simply refer what I mean by 'other aspects' to the notes here. On the other hand, Lusztig also defined 'cells' in affine Weyl groups in a series of papers under the title (Cells in affine Weyl groups), which I have literally zero knowledge about. Here is a couple of questions I am particularly interested in: 1) I read from Sommers-Gunnells (here p.7) that the double cells in affine Weyl group are parametrized by nilpotent orbits in the Langlands dual. This, to my knowledge, is quite different from the case of double cells in Weyl group, whose double cells are parametrized by special orbits in the Langlands dual (correct me if I am wrong). Can anyone give us some intuition on how the parameterization in the affine Weyl group case works? 2) There is a notion of canonical left cell in each double cell of affine Weyl group (here). Are there any results on how these canonical left cells are computed? 

From (1) and (2) , we get: $\mathbb{P}_{\mu} (X^{N+t} =0) \ge p+(1-p)( \sum_{i\ge 0 }^t m(t-i) \mathbb{P}_{V}( T_{C} =i)) $ Take the limit and do some calculations, $ \lim_{ t \rightarrow \infty} \mathbb{P}_{\mu} (X^{t} =0) \ge p+(1-p)( I ( \sum_{i\ge 0 }^t \mathbb{P}_{V}( T_{C} =i) )$ $ = p+(1-p)I (\mathbb{P}_{V}( T_C<\infty))$ $ = p+(1-p)(I \sum_{s \in S'} \mathbb{P}_{s}( T_C<\infty)\mathbb{P}_V ( X_0=s'))$ $ = p+(1-p)(I \sum_{s \in S'} \mathbb{P}_V ( X_0=s'))$ (first condition) $ = p+(1-p)I$ Then take the infimum. $\Rightarrow I \ge p+(1-p)I \Rightarrow I=1$ Therefore, $ \forall \mu \in \mathcal{D}(C) : \lim_{t \rightarrow \infty} \mathbb{P}_{\mu}(X^t = 0)=1$ Which gives $ \mathbb{P}_{\mu}( T_0 < \infty)=1$.()** Finally, $\forall x \in S'$, we have: $ \mathbb{P}_{x}( T_0 < \infty) \ge \sum_{i \ge 0 } \mathbb{P}_{x}( T_0 < \infty | T_C = i) \mathbb{P}_{x}( T_C=i) $ $ =^{**} \sum_{i \ge 0 } 1. \mathbb{P}_{x}( T_C=i) = \mathbb{P}_{x}( T_C< \infty)=1$ Q.E.D 

Before the demonstration of the problem, we start with some propositions Firstly with those concerning $m(t)$ Proposition 1: For all $t \in \mathbb{N}$ , $\begin{array}{lccl} m_t : & \mathcal{D}(C) & \rightarrow & \mathbb{R} \\ &V & \mapsto& m(t,V) \end{array} $ is an affine function. Demonstration 1 If each distribution represented as a stochastic row vector, $m(t,V) $ is indeed equal to $ VP^t\delta_0^T$ .QED Proposition 2: For each $t$, the infimum in the definition of $m(t)$ is achievable, ie. $ \exists \mu_t \in \mathcal{D}(C) : m(t) = m(t, \mu_t)$. Demonstration 2 Following from the previous proposition, in looking for the infimum of $m(t,V)$ over $\mathcal{D}(C)$, we are minimizing a continuous function over a compact set ( $ dim( \mathcal{D}(C) ) < \infty $ as $ |C| <\infty$ ). It therefore has a minimum. Remark 1: As $m_t$ is affine, it is reasonable to even suppose that $\mu_t = \delta_{d_t} $ for some $ d_t \in C$. Proposition 3: $( m(t) )_{t \in \mathbb{N}}$ is an increasing sequence. Demonstration 3 The proposition 2 and the fact that $0$ is an absorbing state imply : $m(t+1) = m(t+1, \mu_{t+1}) = \mathbb{P}_{\mu_{t+1}}( X^{t+1} =0)$ $ \ge \mathbb{P}_{\mu_{t+1}}( X^{t} =0) \ge \min_{\mu \in \mathcal{D}(C)} \mathbb{P}_{\mu}( X^{t} =0) =m(t)$ . QED Then, some proposition for estimation. Proposition 4: $ \exists p> 0 $ and $N \in \mathbb{N}$ such that : $ \mathbb{P}_{U}(X^N =0)>p $ for all $U \in \mathcal{D}(C)$ ,ie : $ m(N) >p$. Demonstration 4 The second condition of the problem shows that for each $ i \in \mathbb{1,n}$ , there is $p_i>0$ and $N_i>0$ such that : $\mathbb{P}_{c_i}( X^{N_i} =0 ) > p_i$ Choose $ p= \min( p_1,p_2,..,p_n); N=\max(N_1,N_2,..,N_n)$, using the fact that $0$ is an absorbing state, we deduce that: $\mathbb{P}_{c}( X^{N} =0 ) > p \forall c \in C$ Therefore, QED. And the last ingredient, Proposition 5: $\lim_{ t \rightarrow \infty} m(t) = \inf_{ \mu \in \mathcal{D}(C) } \lim_{t \rightarrow \infty} \mathcal{P}_{\mu}(X^t = 0)= I $ Demonstration 5: As $0$ is an absorbing state, for all $ \mu \in \mathcal{D}(C) $, $ ( \mathcal{P}_{\mu}(X^t = 0) )_{t \ge 0 }$ is an increasing state. Therefore, $ \lim_{t \rightarrow \infty} \mathcal{P}_{\mu}(X^t = 0) \ge \mathcal{P}_{\mu}(X^n = 0) \ge m(n) \forall n$ $\Rightarrow RHS \ge LHS$ On the other hand, following the remark 1 , and the fact that $|C| $ is finite, we deduce that : $\exists$ an strictly increasing sequence of natural numbers $(n_i)_{i \ge 0}$ and a state $c^* \in C$ such that: $ m(n_i) = m(n_i, \delta_{c^*} ) = \mathbb{P}_{\delta_{c^*} }( X^{n_i} =0)$ As $(m(t))_{t \ge 0}$ is an strictly increasing sequence, we also deduce: $\Rightarrow \lim_{t \rightarrow \infty} m(t) = \lim_{t \rightarrow \infty} \mathbb{P}_{\delta_{c^*} }( X^{t} =0) \ge \inf_{ \mu \in \mathcal{D}(C) } \lim_{t \rightarrow \infty} \mathcal{P}_{\mu}(X^t = 0) $ $\Rightarrow LHS \ge RHS$ QED. Let's begin the main demonstration Demonstration For all $t>0$ , $ \mu \in \mathcal{D}_{C}$ and the fact that $0$ is an absoribng state (*) , we have:
