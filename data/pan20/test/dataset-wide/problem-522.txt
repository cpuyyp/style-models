The answer was obvious. Reset the cable tension on the brakes! Problem solved. Well in my case I bought new cables and due to the fact I had to take the old ones out and set the new ones with correct pressure settings, the lever does not touch the bar tape anymore. 

I had a similar thought with my Campagnolo Ultra-Torque cranks (2010). They made a clicking sound and I suspect it was because one of the cranks came out of alingment. After removing the cranks and inspecting the threading on the retention bolt, I noticed some of the grooves were worn down to bare metal, so in effect my cranks were not on properly, and were not tighten properly (using a torque wrench). After finding this, I went and bought a brand new retention bolt, carefully inspected it, and replaced it. Worked perfectly. Safety is paramount. I would check the threading under the microscope (any hobby microscope with above lighting will do) and note any imperfections in the threading. If any, replace the bolt entirely. 

I took the bike out on a 130km cycle Friday and the bike was like new, going around corners felt so much better/safer/solid. I didn't feel I had to even reach for the brakes so I must have needed a new headset way before now. The LBS somehow managed to tighten the headset in the past when servicing the bike for me but I can't compare the two. I didn't get the bottom bearing removed. It doesn't seem to come off too easily but its not causing problems. The new Cannondale come with a plastic cover (left of the top cap) that seems to sit on the bottom bearing. Not for my 2012 model as its too small. There new compression nut that does a better job than the older model. 

My front wheel has started to wobble a bit at the hub and it's most noticeable when braking at the lights, as the front wheel is doing like a "pulsing" sound when braking - like as if the wheel is off center. I've pulled the hub apart, but I cannot see any obvious issues, yet when I lift the front wheel off the ground, as it's attached to the fork, the wheel slightly shakes when I tap it. It is not firm as it should be. Because I cannot see obviously what's going on, could the bearings inside the sealed-cartridge have worn down in size? There is ample grease on them, but I guess even over time wheel bearings do wear down a micro-millimeter or two? That's the only explanation I have as to why the wheel hub has a slight wobble / shake. Wheel is Campagnolo Vento-Reaction, about 5 years old now. Here's a video of the wheel, showing how to get to the hub bearings... 

Apart from the fact that stickers can be removed (as thats not the point of my question) would if my bike got stolen and i found it, would a sticker with my name on the frame be enough to prove that the bike is mine? Thanks. 

Carbon fibre is certainly a suitable material for mountain bikes. Despite what many people think carbon fibre is actually stronger than alloy, while also being lighter, stiffer and more expensive. The important thing to know about carbon fibre is that unlike alloy damage from a crash may not be visible. Also when carbon fails it snaps, whereas alloy bends in a slightly more controlled way, but that shouldn't matter to you. Durability will be vary good on both carbon and alloy frames. But your description to the question does make me wonder why you are after a full suspension: 

I have on my rig Campag Athena 11 and Record 11 shifters. Recently, I've noticed the rear gear changing lever, are getting stuck on my bar tape, so when I want to upshift my cassette, I have to flick-off the lever from the bar tape quickly and then push the lever to change gears. Has anyone had this issue? Any tips on how to get back to normal shifting? Maybe the angle of movement from rest to shifting can be adjusted back? Any tips appreciated. Thanks UPDATE Sorry I think a picture speaks a 1000 words... this happens when I squeeze the brake lever - not when I am upshifting the rear gears. 

I need a bottom bracket tool to fit a torque wrench (I think they are all 3/8" drive as standard). Wiggle sent me one but it doesn't fit. Do you know the correct torque wrench tool for this Shimano BB-R60 Ultegra 6800/105 5800 Hollowtech ii ? : $URL$ I got this Lezyne one but its too big : $URL$ Shimano supply a plastic TL-FC25 with the BB-R60 B.B but it doesn't fit the Lezyne B.B socket tool. Park Tool have 3 B.B tools but I don't know which one. Or where I can get a cheaper one if they are expensive : $URL$ $URL$ $URL$ 

So im thinking of waxing my chain (with parafin wax) what would the advantages of this be over wet lube (i use muck off). Anybody have any experience with waxed chains? Thanks. 

Yes definitely, I raced all of last years criterium season on my Ridley X-bow (rim brake) with slick tires. The thing you may also want to consider is your gearing, if you have a 1x you may want to use a different cassette. Also if you your bike is disc brake equipped you may not be able to use it in some races. If you are racing in the UK then your in luck as British Cycling have recently announced there allowing of disc brakes in 2018 for road racing and crit, if you are racing somewhere else you will have to check your local stance on disk brakes. 

My carbon frame has some slight scratches and some black gunk around the seat stays. What is the best way to polish the frame to bring it back to its original appearance? I was thinking of using a solvent to remove the black scuff marks and a 1200 wet-n-dry emory paper with water to gently polish the duco back, finishing it with a gentle buff and polish. Someone here reckons the car polishing products are just as good. Any thoughts on this please? UPDATE: Yes I have tried the damp cloth trick already. No good once it dries. Thanks 

How long is a piece of string? Any bicycle is possible, which is the beauty of a bicycle in general. Bicycles can be anything really - roadies, MTB, single-speed, recumbents, even giant A-frame types that have steps to get to the saddle! Your question is very theoretical and will require a proper re-write because you're not being specific to a particular bicycle or size that we could say ok.. here's what you need. As an "answer", all I can say now is that you take your frame and your new build to a competent bike fitter and get fitted for the bike! You may find all that geometry might have to be thrown out the window for the sake of your posture, back and skeletal health. Good luck! 

If you are planning on riding mainly on roads will the accessional dirt road it sounds more like you need a gravel/adventure bike for the kind of riding that you are doing. Edit: If you are planning on riding roads riddled with potholes i still do not think that you need a full suspension mountain bike, where i live also has potholes everywhere, maybe look toward the specialised roubaix or cannondale slate, both road bikes with some form of suspention. 

Off the back of my last question, is there any way i could be able to add some progressiveness to my suspension, maybe i could retrofit tokens or something of the like. Thanks. 

I got the new bearings Thursday evening and once I installed and tightened the headset there was no wobble. 

The bike is around 4 years old but I just notice the crack line now. I think there was always some kind of a hairline crack just a few months after getting it. Its about 3/4 away around, but is it paint or more serious ? the picture is not the best. What are my options going forward ? do you start to look at a replacement frame, send it to be fixed ? (its a Cannondale Super Six 105 Carbon 2012) 

I was told on another forum that the battery should fit the seatpost. I guess I could drill a hole in the frame but it would void the warranty. 

So you your tires appear to be 27.5+ sized, which are generally less common to find in bike shops and may require a fair amount of searching around for. I have faced these problems myself when trying to look for new plus bike tires but keep at it :) 

So i have a cyclocross bike, but most of my friends have road bikes. I am interested if people think that a road bike could be used to race cyclocross. I'm thinking that with a pair of nobbly tires it might work. EDIT: This is a just thought experiment. I have a CX bike which i use for road in the summer and cross in the winter.
