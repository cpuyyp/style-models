No, unfortunately not. In general equilibrium models (as @FooBar already mentioned) buyer's do not think about the influence of their actions on the seller. Therefore, they would just buy at the lowest possible price. However, if you have a game theoretic model including uncertainty about profits of the PWYW firm and risk-averse consumers who prefer the PWYW firm for some reason you might get Nash-equilibria in which PWYW firms have positive profits. Another way to model PWYW firms is to include non-monetary benefits from paying. For example a disutility for being seen as a cheapskate or for exploiting the firm or a positive utility from "doing the right thing" (i.e., paying the price that they think is appropriate). The selfish, rational players will pay a positive price and will generate profits for the firm. I think in reality the impact of non-monetary benefits is much higher than the impact of asymmetric information with risk-aversion. 

Lets say your investment is $x$. What does ROI mean? The money you get per period out of your investment (= revenue). What does break even point mean? The point (here in time) where your total costs (here it is only the investment) are equal to your total revenue. Therefore, the time $t$ at which the total costs are equal to the total revenue is the break even point, with $r$ being the ROI. $$ costs = revenue \\ x = r x t \\ t=\frac1r$$ You can see, it does not depend on $x$, therefore it is possible. 

In most situations it is not clear when a game ends, it is just clear that at every point in time there is a probability that this is the last period of them game. Just try to say what is this $T$ for the life of a human? 150 years? Even if you are 150 years old there is a (probably small) chance that you will survive another year. And the next year? There is also another chance to live another year, and so on. As long as there is no fixed endpoint to the game, infinitely repeated games are, in my opinion, more realistic as long as there is some chance of ending the game included (i.e., as a discount rate). Infinitely repeated games are also a way to resolve some problems backward induction (for example in the Chain-store paradox). You really have to know that there is a very last situation to use backward induction. 

This is also expected, as the demand is pretty high from the start but the supply is (pretty much) constant over time. 

Your mentioned reasons fit very well into the additional benefit category (buying a dream or "cost of the lotto ticket is mitigated") or into the the jumps in the utility function (quitting the job). 

Which means, with definition 2 Cobb-Douglas utility functions with equal weights are always homothetic, with definition 2 only some of them are: $$u(tx,ty) = (tx)^\frac12 (ty)^\frac12 = t xy = t u(x,y)$$ and some are not $$u(tx,ty) = (tx) (ty) = t^2 xy \neq t u(x,y)$$ 

Try to think about what the the optimal level of production is supposed to be. What should it maximize? The revenue? What you have calculated is the revenue maximizing level of production but maybe you wanted to find a level of production that maximizes something different? 

Yes. We know that a monotonic transformation of a utility function still represents the same preferences and as the old utility function represented homothetic preferences the new one does, too. As an easy example you could look at Cobb-Douglas utility functions of the form $u(x,y) = a\left(x y\right)^\alpha$. For $\alpha = \frac12$ the utility function is homogeneous of degree 1, but for every $\alpha,a>0,$ the preference relation is homogeneous of degree 1. We never used homothetic as a property of the utility function to answer your question (as it works for every utility function). A homothetic utility function is, to the best of my knowledge, not very clearly defined, I have see two different versions: 

The best introduction is, in my opinion, the book by Matthew Jackson. It has a pretty nice introduction (even if you know nothing about social networks) and chapters about many of the applications of graph theory in economics. 

There are several possible reasons why collective bargaining and labor unions could have been excluded from antitrust laws, for example: 

This is actually not surprising to an economist, in the end every market is is some kind of "barter system". 

It sounds like you try to model a game on a network (i.e., using game theory with players on a network without changing the network). If this is true, then the following paper might be even more relevant: 

First of all, I don't know if there is a convention as I never use weak preferences myself. But I can give you some suggestion that should work: Do you have a finite number of goods, lets say $n$? Then $\mathbb{N}$ is clearly enough: Just map the best good to 1, the second best to $n$, third best to $n^2$,... . If you are indifferent between 2 goods (lets say they would be ranked third overall) assign them to $n^2$ and $n^2+1$. As @MettaWorldPeace already pointed out: it is kind of "wasteful" to use $\mathbb{N}$, so can we use less? And clearly we can never need more than $(n-1)^n+1$ numbers, so a mapping on $\{1,2, ..., (n-1)^n+1 \}$ would be sufficient (you can use even less numbers, but it is annoying to write down, so I just leave it at that). What if we have a (countably) infinite number of goods? Here we can use the same trick, using $\mathbb{R}$ (or, if you like to, use $\mathbb{Q}$) just assign the best good $1$, the second best $2$, ... . If there are indifferences (i.e., you have three second best goods, the first one is assigned $2$, the second one $2.1$, the third $2.11$(or whatever you like)). Again, as before it is kind of wasteful, what else can you use? You could use a mapping on $\mathbb{N}\times \mathbb{N}$. The same idea clearly works for every other number of goods, but I guess you can figure that out yourself. Remark: This is not more than a different way to write preferences. You can not use this, e.g. as a utility function. However, all of these examples have the property that you can compare the ranking by simple mathematical operations (i.e., comparing $\lfloor \frac{x}{n}\rfloor$ for the first example). 

The problem you mentioned is why dominance is not really used frequently. It is a very weak concept in the sense that is usually has no "grip", i.e. not many strategies are eliminated. That is why we use Nash equilibria or even other concepts (e.g., the trembling hand perfect equilibrium which was mentioned by @desnesp, or, some form of subgame perfection). And this has nothing to do with finitely or infinitely repeated games, this is true for every repeated game (or every game in general). In finitely repeated games the only strategies that are weakly dominated (in your example) are strategies that play $B$ in the very last round, given some history. Let me show you: It is clear that it is dominated (by just switching to $A$ in the last round for this history). Now the other direction: Assume there is a dominated strategy $S$ that plays $A$ in the last round, then there is a strategy which plays $B$ everywhere, but if you played $S$, then plays $A$ in the last round. To this strategy $S$ is strictly better than any other strategy and therefore not dominated. How does that work for infinitely repeated games? In the same manner: You think $S$ is dominated and in $S$ there is always a chance that $A$ is played later? Then there is a strategy which plays $A$ then, iff $S$ was played. (I know this is a little bit sloppy, but I hope you still get the idea.) So, in short: 

You are right, there is, from an economical point of view not that much of a difference between selling a good and labor, so a union could (and most times is) considered a cartel. It is not illegal, because it is explicitly excluded in the antitrust laws (like in the US via the National Labor Relations Act) or not included in the antitrust laws in the first place. 

Is there a journal that publishes replications (failed and successful) of (published) experiments? And, if not, why not? And what about failed experiments (i.e. experiments with insignificant results)? I think replications of experiments are very important, as experiments in economics depend on many different things and most of them we don't really understand. Having replicated an experiment helps to make sure that the results obtained are not by pure chance (or worse). And, more importantly, failed attempts to replicate a study shows that there was something wrong in one of the studies. As this was not clear: I am talking about lab experiments, not field experiments. 

I don't really think it is really interesting to extend this to more than two firms (especially without having solved this for 2 firms), but for both modeling options presented it should be "easy enough". 

Homothetic as different name for homogeneous of degree 1 A homothetic utility function is a utility function that represents a homothetic preference relation. 

Chris Shannon has a nice reading list of the "classics" and there is an article by Truman Bewley on Knightian decision theory which is pretty good. But there are many other problems in which it is applied. As this is not really my research area, I can't really give you an example but you should be able to find some in the articles mentioned, as these fields mostly deal with problems of the kind you are looking for. 

Could one change this? Sure, just check every possible demand and supply effect, you could for example buy many normal items (increases $d_n$), sell many keys (increases $s_k$), many people could ignore keys (decreases $d_k$) or don't sell normal items any more (decreases $s_n$). Another way to change the price in the right direction could be to get a constant stream of new players, which grows larger and larger over time or get enough old players to stop playing. As an economist, I actually see no point in doing that, the market seems to be working like it should. If the designers want to change this, they could do that pretty easily, e.g. by adding new normal items, increasing prices of the keys, add great and expensive consumable items that use up normal items, randomly destroying normal items or just decreasing the normal item drop rate. Remarks: Constant amount of keys: We don't really need a constant amount of keys bought, but that the supply of keys is not increasing much faster than the supply of normal items, so the assumption is not as bad as it sounds. Other reasons? There are probably other possible explanations, but this one seems, at least to me, the most likely. Some additional remarks, not really related to your question:
