In this situation a full brake flush & bleed is always best, but there is something you can try that may get you out of a bind. Orient the bike so that the reservoir is the highest and caliper the lowest, and such that the brake hose attachment on the caliper faces upward. The cable should also be inclined all the way with no dips along the way. Next, tap the caliper and brake hose moving up towards the brake master cylinder using a small wrench or the handle of a screwdriver, etc. This can sometimes entice air bubbles to move up to the master cylinder. After repeating this a couple of times, squeeze the lever multiple times. You may have to reorient the bike or move the brake on the handlebars such that the air bubbles will move from the hose into the cylinder and up the reservoir. Rinse and repeat. Important note : If you have had air in the system in warm/humid weather, you may have gotten water into the system as well, water that is dissolved in the brake fluid and does not come out with the tapping procedure. Lever may feel fine in the garage, but water boils when heated up and may result in brake fade when braking down a long hill etc. Always do a brake flush & bleed when possible. 

You have it backwards. You seem to think pro bike teams are looking to purchase frames from suppliers, and all the supplier needs to do is offer a decent discount. It's the other way around - most pro-tour bike teams require payment from the supplier if they are to display decals, and needless to say the gear will have to be supplied without cost. You will often see a rider on a certain team has insisted on bringing his favorite saddle, which will then have all decals and logs removed if the supplier doesn't want to pay, or the team already has a primary supplier for that part. You will also see them removing logos from tubular tires made specifically for the cobbles, where most the big-shop tire sponsors do not have a suitable tire. As well, you may even see a team using old frames from a competing brand for a cobble stage where the current frame sponsor did not supply a suitable frame - in this case, the frame will either be rebranded or have branding removed. In short, I think the lack of diversity you see is more a fault of the sport and the economics of it, not the fault of niche frame manufactures. Big high-revenue bike companies can afford to bet on multiple teams, while betting on one team may be a too risky proposition for a niche player (especially a team they can afford to sponsor). 

You shouldn't count on it, no. Low-end and touring forks may not have the parts available at all. With medium-to-high end MTB forks, the parts may be available but it often requires exchanging most of the innards, making it a much too costly proposition. It in not just a matter of adding a lever to the top. 

Go through this process. It will ask you to measure several body dimensions and will help you pick the right size frame by how long it is rather than where the toptube meets seattube, which makes a lot more sense when you think about it. It will therefore work the same with a road vs a crossbike (which tends to have lower top tubes) and any compact or other frame designs. You can look up the geometry chart for the model you are interested in to find the Virtual / Effective Top Tube Length and pick the one closest to your optimum. If you are between two frame sizes I recommend choosing the larger one. It is easy to use a shorter stem than what it comes with and should your goals / flexibility change in the future you may appreciate being able to go to a longer stem (if you ever want to lower your handlebars you may also want them further away). 

Assuming you mean a fast cyclist, your best long-term plan is to find ways to enjoy or otherwise remain motivated to train year-round so that you can be consistent for the next many years. Starting from 0, assuming you are consistent, you can hope to be a a fast guy in about 3 years and among the elite (in your age/weight class) in 6. There are many opinions about the actual training content and how it should vary over the course of a year. And mostly, the just that - opinions. There is very little good scientific research on long term training plans, because controlled double-blind studies would take a really long time, have difficulty recruiting participants, and it would be difficult to gain funding because there is no industry interest, not to mention it would be really difficult to design a blind study involving hard physical training. Still, unscientific as it is, you should consider picking up a good book on the subject, as they tent to model the way professional riders train per tradition, and which seems to be working for them. Two of the more popular ones are "The Cyclists Training Bible" and "Training and Racing with a Power Meter". There are also good free resources online. In short, the books will tell you to do the kind of riding you want to be good/fast at, with some variations. Simply riding your bike a lot will probably do wonders for you as well. If you want more specific advice, post more details about your goals. Do you want to win the sprints, be fastest up the hills, be the breakaway hero or win a 24h race? 

Assuming you have already backed the B-tension screw all the way out, I believe your B-tension spring has simply lost its tension. Mine is the same way. I know that spring is replaceable in some derailleurs, and checking whether it is in this one is on my list of things to do. Check with your local bike shop. 

Check and see if your cranks can move side-to-side. You might need to loosen the left crankark, push it on all the way and re-tighten. 

The brake will only suck in air if air is already present in the reservoir. With some brakes this may not be a problem. With brakes where this is a problem, you could take the rather extreme step of closing the reservoir while immersed in brake fluid (after carefully turning and vibrating to release air bubbles). No, I haven't tried, and yes it would be a lot easier if you could find a brake system that by design never has air inside the reservoir. 

First thing to understand is that the drag force you experience is a function of relative air speed. If air speed reverses (tail wind stronger than speed of movement), drag becomes negative meaning the force will try to accelerate you rather than decelerate you. Second thing is, this drag force function is not a linear function but actually dependent on relative wind speed squared. What this means is the difference in drag force is felt much more strongly when wind speed is high. In practice when wind speed is below 10-20km/h you hardly feel it, and therefore if you experience negative wind speed in the same range it will make only a marginal difference for you. For example, let's say you are riding your bike with power that would propel you at 35km/h and you have a 25km/h tail wind, your drag force is reduced by 91% - a massive difference for sure. However, stronger winds will have relatively smaller impact - a 45km/tail wind that would result in you having a negative 10km/h windspeed would give you a 109% decrease in force (resulting in a negative drag force at a magnitude only 9% of the drag you experienced while traveling at 35km/h in no wind). If you thought that difference between a 25 and 45km/h tailwind is significant, get this - when you have a 25km/h headwind, you are looking at a drag force 294% stronger than what you were facing in no wind, and if that headwind was 45km/h, 522% stronger. This is why you should probably be much more concerned with minimizing your profile in a headwind than maximizing it in the rare occurrence of a tailwind faster than your road speed. You can find more about the drag formula at $URL$ and if you are a more hands-on type of guy, you can use an online bike speed/power/drag calculator to play with some numbers and understand the impact to your speed - here is one example: $URL$ Third thing is, in the real world wind is often attacking you at an angle and this makes everything more interesting. Think of how a ship is able to go up against the wind. In deed, a disc wheel or very deep rim can provide slight negative drag force in headwind attacking at an angle. This wasn't part of your question, but theoretically if you had a way of avoiding getting blown off the road (this tends to be a problem with disc wheels), setting a sail could provide you a benefit in a sidewind. 

The short and long deraileur cages each have a specified "capacity". This capacity is the sum of the (largest cog - smalest cog) + (largest chainring - smallest chainring). For example, if you have a tripple 30/39/52 tripple with that 11-32 cassette, you will need a deraileur capacity of (52-30)+(32-11)=43. I don't think they make them that large - current Tiagara large is 39, but check on your model/year specifically. With a 39 capacity deraileur cage, you can afford only 11 difference on the front, will only work with a 36-46 cyclocross style crank. As the other answer stated, you will likely also need a new chain. That being said, while it is not recommended, you could use a derailleur cage that falls a bit short on capacity as long as you avoid the small/small gear combos. If you go this way, first make sure your chain is long enough to accommodate the large/large gear. Then make sure you know which small/small gearcombos are going to be off limits by testing before riding the bike (or calculating from capacity), and make sure you NEVER try to use those gears. Make sure you understand all this before proceeding, it is as I said not recommended. I believe when the pros pull tricks like this for especially steep mountain stages, they are using a MTB derailleur or the cage from a MTB derailleur on their road derailleur - or the rider is just really confident he knows what he is doing.
