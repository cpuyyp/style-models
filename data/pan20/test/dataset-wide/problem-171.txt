As there is no atmosphere on the Moon and no life there will be (almost) no decay at all; the only reasons for decay are: 

We are still far away from being able to correctly interpret a neural system and to be able to simulate that on a computer of some kind. We have a kind of mixed situation about our understanding of brain (and nervous system in general) physiology; I will try to sketch what I understand of "State of the Art". 

Problem is "what happens of property not inherited?". You own a house, you die, what happens to the house? Goes to the State? What about your spouse/husband? The only way to make it stick is to completely remove private property rights, which is probably more than you asked for. Even if you buy and go for a "everything is rented" model you move the "inheritance problem" to income (and, presumably, job) with rampaging nepotism where everyone with a bit of decision power would fight to put their "heirs" in the best available positions. This is a fundamental push of all humans (and most of other animals as well) and all real attempts to thwart it have failed. Fictional works dealing with the problem exist and some are very intriguing (outstanding is The World of Null-A by A. E. van Vogt). In practice stratification of society cannot be completely stopped and drastic methods tend to make problem worse, instead of solving it. Some "less drastic" methods might give better results: 

You can have an underground "River of Life", which is the underground emissary of a large lake literally choking in Spirulina algae. The algae will readily die when taken away from light, but they can boot-start your food chain starting with small fishes, following larger fishes, etc. Large deposits ashore can feed the luminous fungi described by @d_hippo and start some vegetal development. 

I am not really sure of premises. As pointed out in my answer other technologies would take the place of metals in toolmaking. Metals happened to be the "least effort" path in our history, but they are surely not "mandatory" for development beyond stone age (BTW: "bronze age" and "iron age" would have been impossible "by definition", of course, but I'm speaking about a social equivalent). I'm not sure of what would be development in such a world, but I know quite well Japan middle-age had "castles" very different from the European ones (and from Chinese ones, for that matter). I'm pretty sure we would have found a way to manufacture tools even without metals, probably using glass and ceramic to complement wood and stone (cutting and working wood and stone was a well-known technology in paleolithic). Of course development in everyday life would have followed a different course, but imagining which would be very much "opinion based". 

Current technology isn't based on single walled hulls, quite the contrary. Have a look to this; to stop high velocity (small) debris a first outer shell, quite far from the internal one, has duty to break the incoming meteor in smaller particles that will be handled more easily by internal layers. This seems to be the most effective shielding, especially in a weight-constrained environment with high speed incoming projectiles. 

I will not repeat what @Xenocacia correctly said (+1!), but I feel some important bits are left out: 

Let us take the process as per "face value", I've strong doubts it could really be performed as-specified (i.e.: very high ground temperature is bound to affect both atmosphere and cauterize to a much deeper depth), but that's another story. Let us assume really just a few topsoil centimeters are heated instantaneously to something like 1500Â°C. This takes a huge amount of heat and would have several side effects: 

If situation is bad enough to suspend civil rights and warrant enforcing quarantine with weapons, if necessary then military would take over and: 

What you are actually describing (very briefly) is some kind of corsair bands operating on land, instead of sea. Any such corp is shaped by terrain and enemy characteristics. In a very rocky terrain you can shape them as free climbers attacking from apparently inaccessible positions. If "enemy" is stationed in impregnable positions on top of mountains you can have a band of burrowers undermining (literally!) their positions. If incursions come through passes you can have brigand clans acting as highwaymen blocking strategic points and pillaging on the (would be) pillagers. 

General idea is CLI is not necessarily "stupid" and, by the time OP conditions come true it's very likely some good quality A.I. will be available, but it should never rely on "intuition" or things said in a way not perfectly clear to take action, but it should rely on clear evidence the person know exactly what's asking, and that is much better done in written form. 

You are speaking about a "glitch", which is a specific bug in programming allowing you to do things you shouldn't be able to do. If this can crash the game it is dependent on the specifics of the glitch itself. It's not something that can be seen "a priori", you play and you (possibly) use bugs and exploit them in "creative" ways. This is completely different from logic inconsistencies (eventually) present in the simulation (e.g.: magic system allowing you to create arbitrary amount of matter), which you may be able to exploit or not. Example: with a magic system like the one above you could create a mass greater than that of the whole planet some kilometer over your head and literally "crash" the game under its weight; otherwise You can spawn continuously rabbits till the game crashes trying to keep track of them all. Other types of inconsistency would leas to different paradoxes with which the system may or may not be able to cope (a system might overflow simply failing to spawn more rabbits, instead than crashing). 

You have to provide the energy to shoot the arrow with your arm muscles and this is an heavy job even for trained archers. Increasing the "fire rate" is very demanding if you want to give your arrow enough power to be really damaging. The time needed to nock the arrow is negligible compared with the recovery time of your muscles with a powerful (e.g.: 105lb ~= 50kg ~= 450N) longbow. (note: compound have a drop, so it is much easier to keep the stance while aiming, but you have to provide the energy all the same). Aim fast and true. "Fast" is needed to avoid tiring arms uselessly by keeping bow bent. 

Building an old "Hiroshima style" A-bomb is not difficult once you get the fissile material, that's the reason why they're trying to regulate (read: "make pretty much impossible") to make nuclear reactors for countries that do not already have them. Once you lay your hands on enough fissile material building a bomb is within capabilities of (almost) any "smartass". Getting the fissile is the problem. After you've done that all you have to do is to put a certain quantity (the "critical mass") all together in a place. Small problem is you have to be fast otherwise it will fuse in your hands ("predetonates" is the technical term). Reason for this is chain reaction starts in the surfaces facing each other, but it's still unable to self sustain, so the surfaces will melt (fast in a matter of milliseconds) and reaction will stop. It will begin again if you keep bringing back together until the whole mass is fused and starts digging a (very radioactive!) hole in the floor. In the original bomb they had two half-spheres, each under critical mass, that were brought together by an explosive charge (i.e.: one was the target and the other was shot at it with something resembling a short cannon). Once you have a ball of enriched Uranium bigger then critical mass chain reaction will not stop so easily due to inertia of Uranium that will remain in place long enough to generate a nice Atomic Mushroom (highly venomous variety).
