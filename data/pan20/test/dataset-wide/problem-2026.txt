Many useful answer but I feel another perspective might be useful. Sounding arrogant is to some extent in the eye of the beholder. In some cultures (national and/or corporate) sharing knowledge or correcting a superior might simply be unacceptable. One answer is therefore: Realize this, try to accept it and do your job as good as you can. If you feel this is impairing your own development or future career or if there are legal ramifications or risks for third parties, this might not be the right course of action but ultimately you are not responsible for the whole company and all your coworkers. Besides, is your team unable to function or deliver anything of value? Can you explain some practical benefits to your preferred approach (as opposed to it being new and considered a “best practice”)? If not, it would suggest that your coworkers' approach is good enough. 

In countries/jurisdictions where the law does not provide for clear limitations like this, employers might be tempted to slap a broad non-compete clause on everybody's contract – that might be the source of the story you read – but that does not mean they would necessarily bother with enforcing it in each and every case. And I currently work for a very large company, in a locale where the rules are pretty lax, yet my contract only has a very reasonable non-compete clause so don't let this stop you from applying wherever you want. If that's really a show-stopper for you, you can always ask about it after you got an offer and before handing in your notice for your current job. Finally, a friend of mine once switched from an employer to another one that was clearly covered by her non-compete agreement but her new employer was willing to cover any damages/penalty she might have to pay for breaking her contract and approached her former employer to negotiate directly with them. 

A side note: I've worked for two huge retailers here in the United States (think several dozen $bn in revenue annually), and both of them had a strict "no theft" policy. If a person were terminated from any store, distribution center or even office of either company (for theft, financial violations, privacy violations, etc.) you were permanently blacklisted from the company, everywhere, within hours. One of the portions of IT companies don't skimp on is finding proper employees. My advice to you is to let it go, and forget you ever worked there. 

First thing first: passwords are supposed to be secret. This means other people should not have access to your password, and should not be able to see it, blah blah blah. (This has been covered by the other answers for the most part.) What people don't consider is what happens when you make a mistake (and you will). If you're in the IT world (especially Software Development / Programming / whatever you call yourself as a person who writes software for a living) you usually end up being a touch-typist. You learn to type fast, precisely, and without even needing to look at the screen or keyboard. (In fact, I typed the majority of this answer while reading some Android and Twitter documentation.) What this means is that, while mistakes end up less frequent in terms of mistakes-per-time-typing (generally with our speed we gain accuracy) this ends up usually resulting in much more prevalent mistakes. That is: your mistake ends up blowing up extremely quickly. I cannot tell you how many times I've thought I was in a specific window (like a login window) to find out I'm typing my password into an Email I was formulating for a user, or into my "username" field because I missed the "tab". (I've even accidentally sent secured passwords to strangers via internet chats, I've changed them since, but it can happen.) So when this happens, ask yourself: can I afford for this password to be accidentally sent to someone else? 

It's not unheard of but certainly not a given so it's completely normal to provide one but also completely normal not to. It can be something you can negotiate individually before you take the job or something that is available to all new hires under certain conditions or provided for in collective bargaining agreements. But if your contract and/or company rules don't foresee it, you are out of luck. It's not something you can expect or that your employer necessarily has to provide. You can always ask (but it seems you have done that already) but there is no point in pushing it, especially if, as you wrote in a comment, you are not willing to walk away. Another solution to your rental problem however could be to ask for a salary advance from your employer. Unlike a relocation allowance, it will probably be taxed like regular income and you would have to pay it back in the coming months but it could save you money compared to staying at hostels and avoid a lot of stress. This is something I have seen in your situation (new hire from abroad who need money for a deposit - as opposed to being in debt or spending it on something crazy). 

Yes this literally happened. I messed up. Three years ago (almost to the day) I applied to a company, did their technical test, interviewed, and was offered a job. Today I accidentally reapplied, and a different person responded to my application (almost immediately, literally minutes from application) with the exact same technical skills test I had last time. Do I tell this new person about the events from three years ago? I'd definitely take the job now, the only reason I didn't then was due to a salary and benefits advantage of an alternate company. I did my diligence and called them back and informed them (politely) that I couldn't take the position as a better opportunity arose. 

This was literally the password I used to access certain systems that were, in fact, not in my home. These were systems that I needed to always remember access for, prevent brute-force attacks for, and avoid the possibility of someone reading over my shoulder. (It's hard to follow an 8-12 character password, it's harder to follow a sentence of a password.) Now, after typing this time-and-time again it literally became second nature, and that sentence (which, hilariously, is one of the lines from "Once in a Lifetime" by the Talking Heads) became the single fastest sentence I can now type. So take one of these inappropriate passwords you came up with (which are also, conveniently, designed to require a lot of thinking power to process) and ask yourself: am I comfortable with burning this information into my brain and nature? You will literally be thinking about these things on a very frequent basis, and if the password is something you don't feel inappropriate thinking about, then I guess that answers that. 

It's not uncommon but they vary a lot and the devil is in the details. Depending on the country/jurisdiction, there might legal restrictions curtailing the enforceability of such a non-compete clause: 

It's not an obvious double standard because you are not in the same position to begin with, being male. You just wrote you hadn't actually thought about it before, that's a luxury women don't have in general. That's just a fact. That's why it makes perfect sense to consider that the exact same words don't have the same meaning when uttered by a woman. That context makes all the difference. From that perspective, what you should do about the whole situation is educated yourself about the issues and focus on the more pressing problem (it's not men's rights or your boss relatively minor inconvenience…). 

Trying to provide a somewhat more nuanced answer between Alec's and Joe's, I would say it feels a bit mean but he does have a point. While it might feel intrusive, there are certainly other jobs in which this could be a problem. On the other hand, it's absolutely not true that it's going to be a problem everywhere. It all depends on the type of job, whether you clock in or not, etc. I have had jobs where I was mostly free of my use of time. I hope that if someone would have spent hours on the loo, people would notice and worry a little but, whether I came at 9 or 11 and went to the loo right after arriving, before leaving, or after lunch made absolutely no difference. In those type of jobs (i.e. outside of an assembly line or call centre in which every minute is controlled and accounted for), it's also illusory to think you can micromanage employees and increase productivity by curtailing toilet breaks. As long as you are not spending hours on the loo or otherwise slacking off in a big way, whether you do it just after coming to work or later in the day should therefore not make any difference and your boss complaining about that has more to do with asserting his power and control over you than anything else. Still, that's a factor in many workplaces so, even if I don't agree with some other answers' attempt to legitimate this, you have to recognise that it's not uncommon and be prepared to deal with it in the future. Practically in this case, since you are already on your way out, there is no need to overthink this. If preserving your relationship with that manager is important and you really can't help but go to the loo around that time, try to arrive earlier and do it before 11. It's just one month, after all. 

By all indications, the remainder of your interview went appropriately, and you don't mention it being ended prematurely, so in that case chances are the argument was not egregious enough to warrant immediate dismissal. So, here's the advice I'll give you based on typical responses to interviewing: 

Ignore whatever fills in the "beliefs" on either side, let's be generic. First, you have several options: 

Third, I don't think you realize what the consequences are if someone does find this out. Especially in the area I live in, employer-employee relationships are 100% at-will, and I mean 100%. My employer can literally fire me for whatever they want that is non-discriminatory (they can't fire me for being a male, but if I start a hate-group against females then I'm fair game). Can you really afford to take such a risk? (This is just for completeness, other answers already covered this.) I once had a coworker whose password was "", literally. (He loved it: he bragged a lot about that password.) One of the managers overhead this bragging, and several minutes later the coworker was walked out of the building and ordered never to return. Is that a risk you're willing to take? 

Yes, that's what the text you quoted means (but then I am not a lawyer and have no idea what other German statutes or case law might be relevant – note that this is the German implementation of an EU directive). But even if taking all 30 minutes before the six-hour mark is not mandated by the law, it does not seem forbidden either (“Die Ruhepausen […] können […] aufgeteilt werden.”) So your employer is probably within its rights by implicitly forcing you to take your breaks in that way, as long as you never have to work more than 6 hours in one chunk and have at least 30 min break in total (what the employer has to do is plan a break, not let you take it whenever you want). At the same time, it's not uncommon to see time tracking systems that implement such requirements incorrectly and your recourses are typically limited (I have seen much worse, to the point that it became a contentious issue in the organization). Employees or their representatives can ask to have the system fixed but until then, you don't necessarily have any basis to be compensated for those 15 min. Now that you know how the system works, it's up to you not to lose them, for example by taking a 30 min break in one chunk. You also have to ask yourself if you really want to make a fuss about this (and if you do, it's probably best not to do it alone but, e.g., through a trade union).
