Top-notch mountain trekking shoes are advertised as having Vibram soles. They are supposed to be durable and have superior traction on wet stones, mud etcsetra. This is what we want from na mtb tire, right? Then why no vibram tires? 

Because anti-pollution masks contribute to overheating (that's my experience), they are an option in colder climates or during winter. Not only it is filtering the air, but is also warming it and your face. Get a double-filter one for less air resistance (theoretically half - parallel air restrictions act just like parallel resistors). Another point is that the vast majority of exposure to high-density car pollution is while waiting on a traffic light (there was an article about this somewhere). Consequently - try to manoeuvre out of that. If you are riding to the side of the road, you can learn the traffic patterns and when approaching a traffic light to slow down until you expect it to turn green very soon. If you are riding like a car, in the middle of the lane, I suspect you could still manoeuvre your way to the front of the column, where I imagine the pollution buildup would be lesser than in the centre of the column. And as my Ecology professor said - don't ride directly behind the bus :D 

Somewhere from the non-drive side of the drivetrain is coming loud squeak when I pedal hard. The story is long. First I threaded the BB-ES25 incorrectly, and had to spend half an hour with a file to remove the 2 outermost threads (Conclusion: Never torque anything into aluminum with a wrench. Torque it by hand, then tighten by wrench.) Then I installed my octalink crankarms, but lost the washer between the non-drive side fixing bolt and the crank arm. After a couple of weeks, the BB lockring came loose, getting stuck against the crankarm and forcing me to carry the bike home. After tightening it a lot*, another week passed and my non-drive side crankarm fell off. I tightened it a lot after that. Recently I purchased a torque wrench and re-tightened everything. The BB lcokring to 70Nm and the crankarm fixing bolts to 50Nm. There is still squeaking, and I guess it is not coming from the left pedal. What could be wrong now? 

Has someone discovered a way to carry sunglasses, so that they can be put on or removed while riding? I have tried two approaches, and both have drawbacks. Carrying in a pouch, attached to the shoulder ring of the backpack results in scratched lens, because of the vibrations. Carrying in the chest pocket of a jacket is possible only when it is sufficiently cold to wear a jacket. My backpack is large and with a lot of options for hanging equipment on it, so maybe some kind of attachable box or external pocket? 

Also there are tips about riding in traffic on pages 13 through 30 of this document: Cycling Skills Ontario’s Guide to Safe Cycling It's all good, including the pages about trucks and buses. Also the (Ontario-specific) law about riding on the right is interesting: 

So: around freezing. Coming home on Friday (no snow or anything) it was around 0C / 32F, with an intermittent 20mph / 30kph wind. I was wearing cycling shoes, cycling-specific full-length jeans, a thin sport shirt, a zip-up thin woolen jersey with the zip partially down and the sleeves pushed up, and gloves. At the end of my hour-long commute, a group of pedestrians (all wearing coats) asked if I wasn't cold: but I was hot. When I got home I was still warm (slightly sweating). But although the inside of me was warm and pumped, the outside of my skin was cold (even under my shirt). Cycling can let you burn quite a lot of calories. Also my feet were numbing by the end, and thank goodness for warm-enough (but not too warm) gloves. I'm trying some Sugoi Firewall GT cycling gloves, which have a built-in lining, and don't get too hot. I think I'll use warmer gloves, and a wind-proof shell, and do something about my feet, when it gets colder (below freezing). Your commute is 4.5 miles, so 7 km. I cycle that in 20 or 25 minutes (to give you an estimate of how hot I'm running). If the road surface gets treacherous (e.g. snowy) then you want to be dressed more warmly, because you dare not (for safety) cycle so fast, and therefore can't generate as much body heat (mitigated slightly by there being less wind at lower speeds). 

Given graphs like the first one on this page, which show how steeply wind resistance increases with speed, I take it that small changes in shape can be relatively important/effective at high speeds (and not at relatively low speeds). E.g. my top speed when commuting is about 30 kph; the tour de France speeds on the flat are more like 50 kph. The power required to overcome wind resistance at 50 kph is more than triple that required at 30 kph. It's also relatively important/effective if and only if you've already improved/maximised everything else (e.g. the rider's position and clothing). 

Rim brakes are OK on "road bikes" a.k.a. "racing bikes", which are meant for going rather than for stopping; when I bought a bike for commuting though I got one with disk brakes, because I'm cycling in vehicular traffic and in the rain (or snow). I understand that disk brakes are also used on mountain bikes, which need to stop when going downhill and when wet and muddy. Apparently disk brakes are inherently better gripped, because they don't get as wet and dirty (and/or they're smaller than a rim so they wipe dry more easily when you apply the brake), and they're stronger so you can squeeze them harder (because the disk is a solid whereas a wheel rim isn't). With these brakes, if I squeezed the brake hard and fast I could reliably skid the back wheel even on dry road. I've never dared to squeeze the front brake too hard: because I suspect they'd stop the wheel though not the bike. 

As is known for Shimano sealed bottom bracket cartages (e.g. page 16 here), if the BB cup is made out of metal, grease should be applied to the frame-cup thread. If the cup is plastic, grease should not be applied. My question is what is the purpose of applying grease? On a side note, I have heard of a couple of explanations, none of which I can prove or disprove. Firstly, to prevent difficult removal of the cups due to corrosion of cold welding. And secondly, to prevent intrusion of water and contaminants through the threads. 

In many mtb movies about the style "Downhill" the riders casually twist their fork and front tire at jumps, such as here and here. Is this a stunt for "cool points" or does it aid in stability/speed in some way (as in, helps you finish first)? 

What are the rear derailleur families, offered by Shimano? I need to replace a Shimano Acera derailleur and am trying to decide on a replacement part. 

I will share how do I commute in rain to work. I haven't tried an umbrella, however. A long raincoat, plus short pants and sandals keeps me dry during the wearmer months. If you go this way, pаy special attention to the hood - ideally it should have two adjusting straps - one for face aperture (the one on the picture has) and one for depth of the hood - it is on the upper and back side of the hood and is essential to adjust your hood so that you see well, and are still protected. 

Questions: 1) I have heard Shimano and SRAM FDs are compatible - is that true? 2) 73mm BB - check, 48.8mm chain line - how do I check this? Is it correct to measure with a ruler from the center of the frame to the middle of the two chainrings? I doubt I can get accurace better than a couple of mm. 3) 66-69 degrees chainstay - check - it it inscribed on the old FD. 4) The tooth capacity is OK, but my big ring is 2 teeth too large. All in all, can this equipment work together or be made to work together, or do I need to toss it? 

Recently, on a beginner MTB lecture, I learned that the pedal axle should in no part of the stroke be horizontally in front of the knee. Not observing this is unhealthy for the knees. Also, here (btw great video) they explain a similar thing. For a "correct fit", the knee should line up with the pedal axle. Currently I am riding my little sister's mtb. The seat is high enough, but even being slided maximum to the front, I fail the above test miserably (the seat tube is quite angled). A couple of weeks of short rides, and my knees already hurt constantly (maybe placebo effect?). Why would having the seat too far back be unhealthy for the knees? 

For carrying clothes (or anything else) I don't use a backpack (a backpack isn't good for cycling, and is very bad for causing sweat) but rather use a pannier attached to the side of the bike. In summer even pedestrians will sweat somewhat when they're outside. It seems to be a non-issue. 

Assuming that you and your bike mass 100kg (in round numbers), an extra 1kg causes a 1% increase in weight, i.e. a 1% increase in the potential energy associated with climbing the hill. If your power output is constant, that implies a 1% increase in time. However some of your power output is going to overcome wind and rolling resistance, not potential energy. If only half of your power is going to potential energy (which depends on weight), and half is constant (independent of weight), I think that would imply a 0.5% increase in time. 

More on the GORE-TEXT web site. A jacket's performance depends partly on how its made (e.g. mine has a mesh lining inside which keeps it away from the skin, helps ventilation). It wasn't especially cheap; but I've had it for maybe 15 years now and it seems to me good as new (though unfortunately that brand isn't made/sold anymore). For what it's worth and for example, Amazon UK are selling Paclite jackets for GBP90..120. If it were me I'd want to try one on before I bought it. You might also find clothes discounted/on sale sometimes. 

Is it because I'm new to cycling, and my age? Yes it's obviously because you're new to cycling, but maybe something else as well: a medical condition, maybe what you're drinking, or how you using your bike. I'm about your age and so are others, so it can't be just your age. Maybe I'm doing too much? Yes. I became fitter with an 18 km commute: 18 km each way (36 km total), 5 days a week. 36 km is about 22 miles. When I started it wasn't just an effort but an unaccustomed strain, and I couldn't or wouldn't do it every day. One day of work and one day of rest (or one day of work and two days of rest) might be a good beginning. Even then I had hours of rest including lunch in the office, between each half of my daily journey. It took me several months before I could do that every day. The point of rest (including whole days of rest) is that apparently the work wrecks your body, and the rest (and nutrition) rebuilds the body stronger than it was before. Now I can run longer and more often, but "24 miles, rest, 17 miles" is a significant run for a beginner. I don't think your thighs should be burning though: I don't think I remember my thighs doing that. 

Take a look here. Page five lists 700C as french marking for 28". Be sure to read their preceding discussion, where they explain that correspondences are somewhat arbitrary and it is not impossible for 28" tyres to not fit perfectly on your rims (your dealer was probably correct). 

Consider a SunTour XCR coil fork or any similar. Service manuals suggest "full service" every 30 hours of riding time. I take that to mean removing the boots and re-lubing the stanchions. However, this includes the removal of the grips, in order to remove the hydraulic front brake lever. I am worried that the grips are being worn out by this process, causing them to turn freely and thus be very inconvinient for rideing. In this situation, how often should I service the fork? 

Here are a couple of downsides of both types, that I have witnessed. Hydraulic. Leaking oil tends to get into the pads and rotor, rendering the first useless and the second in need of professional cleaning. Mechanical. Cable failure is very perilous. Essentially one moment you have full stopping power, the next moment the brake is disengaged fully. Additionally, this tends to happen when you squeeze the brake lever hard. When does one squeeze the brake lever hard? Correct - when you need to stop NOW and HARD. Maintenance. Mechanical require the annoying static pad adjustment every month or two. Hydraulic require the somewhat difficult bleeding every year or two. The first incident I only observed. The second has happened to me multiple times with possibly misconfigured Shimano BR-M416 

For the fiddly stuff (screws, cable ends) one of those could work. They are not very durable, but are extremely inexpensive (I got an identical box for under 1EUR). Look in the electronics (soldering equipment, wires, inexpensive speakers, PCB audio amplifiers) kind of stores. 

My commuter bike (a cheap-ish MTB) is in need of new gears. As I never use the "granny chainring", I was thinking about switching to a 2-piece crankset, to save tome weight. However, I am unable to locate such parts in my favorite on-line bike shop. Are 2-chainring cranksets direct replacement to a 3-piece ones? Are they affordable or are already some sort of exotic expensive equipment? 

I read an article on full suspension bikes, explaining and . They say the bicycle is the only vehicle, where the gear affects the suspension characteristics. This is great, they continue, because the kinematics can be made so that in some gears of the front chainrings the cranks and rear axle are isolated, while in others pedalling blocks the suspension travel. Firstly, because some people are commenting that the article is grossly incorrect, I would like an opinion on that. Secondly, as every mountain biker looking to spend some bucks knows, the fuzz is Enduro now. And 1x10 or 1x11 drivetrain. If the article is correct, this setup is robbing FS bikes of a lot of their potential. How come no one is raising the alarm?
