I feel compelled to ask, what has credibility got to do with atheism or faith? Why should an atheist be considered more or less credible than someone who believes in a deity? If someone is a priest, yet philosophized the non-existence of God, would it hold that he were necessarily a hypocrite, or merely exploring another point of view and questioning his faith? If someone is a self-proclaimed atheist in public, but secretly prays to God, is he necessarily a hypocrite, or is he someone who is questioning his atheism - in some ways his faith? In both cases, you could say that neither is strictly practicing what they preach, and yet it doesn't necessarily follow that they lack credibility if your own beliefs align with theirs. The Christian may say that the Atheist lacks credibility because history documents through scripture that God exists, and the evidence is irrefutable to those willing to see it. The Atheist likewise says that there is no fundamental basis for the existence of a supreme being and the evidence is irrefutable because there is no directly observable proof. As to whether anything has changed, do we have any knowledge that confirms that ancient philosophers weren't vilified for an apparent hypocrisy? We do know that many were persecuted in their day for teaching heresies, so outwardly practicing hypocrisy would have been a means of survival, but not necessarily an indication that the philosophers themselves were actually hypocritical. Is it any more necessary today to practice what you preach? Today we have technologies undreamed of in ancient times. I think that makes it so much harder for anyone today to preach one way, yet live another. In ancient times, your reputation could not be disproved merely on hearsay unless you had a particularly vocal and powerful opponent. These days, any kid with a smartphone can be your undoing. In some ways, it is therefore more important to practice what you preach. However, the general public can be quite forgiving. Give it a few years, and people will forget an indiscretion or two. Do some amazing good in the mean time, and they'll forgive you as well. The cynic within me also feels compelled to point out that with good PR, even the most vilified individuals are likely to be portrayed positively enough that the odd hypocritical moment will be overlooked. Those who live a hypocritical daily existence however, are likely to be treated rather harshly, yet like those philosophers of old, each will have a loyal core following who will see past the practice in order to accept the preach. In that sense, perhaps things haven't really changed at all. 

A true act of altruism is a choice made by an individual to serve the needs of others without thought of gain for one's self. Thus, if you are forced or coerced to commit an act for the greater good, then you are not yourself acting altruistically, but instead acting out of either duty or of a fear of reprisal. Regardless of the apparent benefit to one's self, it is more likely to be in the better interests of the coercer to push someone to an act of apparent altruism. As for right or wrong, you might personally feel it is wrong for someone to force another person to behave in a particular manner, yet another person may feel it satisfies their own morality if they can provide a suitable justification for their act of coercion, or perhaps justification isn't required. Perhaps it is suits the coercer's morality to force an act of apparent altruism, simply because it can be done. In the case however of the media publishing stories about the billionaires who are all standing together to persuade other billionaires to do some apparent good in the world, I suspect it may in part be that there are feelings involved of accomplishment, pride, and a need for a measure of validation for individual acts through the subsequent similar actions of peers. But in this case, we are perhaps starting to blur the lines between philosophy and psychology, and therefore the issue of morality may be irrelevant. 

Mathematics is a part of the real world. We have well understood concept of all numbers at once although we cannot operate on all of them at once of course. Moreover we have well understood concept of continuity - say of a continuous line without any gaps, and this requires "next level" of infinity, more potent than the infinity of 1,2,3,... It might be that these concepts do not have any physical realization, but the real world contains many things that do not have any place in physics - or also in mathematics, for that matter 

Disclaimer: I am not a marxist in any way and in fact have not read anything by him, I am just trying to give a logical answer to the question. Does it contradict anything that by coordinated effort it is possible to raise some day a generation of people with the typical specimen, when seeing something that the society needs to be done and finding oneself capable to do it, reacts with a desire to go ahead and do it? In fact I think fragments of such societies have emerged many times, both in humans and in the rest of the animal world. 

Why not do it in words? If both P and Q are true then P is true. A fortiori if either P is true or both P and Q are true then P is true. Converse is even easier - if P is true then either P is true or any R (including both P and Q) is true. 

In my opinion there is an obvious logical inconsistency here. If these cycles are to be identical then just as in this cycle we have no evidence of the others except for the idea itself with the status of a hypothesis, then we will be in exactly the same situation in all of these cycles, and then it absolutely does not matter whether they do exist or not. Similar but slightly different argument: even if we assume they exist, still - given they are absolutely identical, this makes ontological status of their multitude questionable. How does an infinite multitude of absolutely identical anythings differ from a unique such anything? In fact even if they only differ by time when they occur and by nothing else, this still makes them different, so even the time itself must repeat in cycles, and then I cannot even think of any way of distinguishing between an infinite number of cycles and a single one which is tracked many times. Consider a circle, say, drawn on table. The fact that I can describe to you features of this drawing in succession along the circular trajectory and when reaching the point where I started describing then just go on and continue repeating myself many times does not make it several circles, right? It is still one circle, I am just describing it several times. 

For me it is by no means obvious that evolution reduces to prolonging one's existence and/or facilitating reproduction indefinitely and nothing else. Even staying within most primitive version of darvinism, nothing excludes the possibility that survival of species may (have) reach(ed) stages when something much more elaborate than that is required to survive in the long run. Like in complicated games such as chess - to win against increasingly strong opponents you must perform more and more elaborate calculations more and more steps ahead. 

Imagine these two thoughts experiments The first one, slightly modified from "Jim and the Indians" by Bernard Williams: You come upon twenty people taken hostage by an armed group. The groups's leader tells you that they are going to kill all but one designated hostage. However, they make you an offer that if you kill that one person (with a weapon that they supply) and they will let the rest go. Will you accept the offer? Note: this is slightly different from William's original setup that if you don't take the offer, one hostage will still be alive. Second one, from 7:25 in this video about utilitarianism: You are a doctor and you have 5 patients waiting for, respectively, a heart transplant, a lung transplant, a liver transplant, and two patients needing a kidney each. If they don't get the transplant, they will die soon. You don't have such organ available, but you have an option of killing another healthy person (who happens to be a donor match for all these patients) and taking that poor guy's organ for the 5 patients. It seems that both experiments are equivalent, they are the case of killing one life by one own's hand vs letting many die by refusing to kill. If we go by strict utilitarianism, one should go for the option with less people ending up dead (i.e. killing one person), or if we go by strict Kantianism, one should not kill, so one should refuse the offer in the first experiment and let the patients die in the second. But, intuitively, it seems to me that taking the armed group's offer is somewhat more ethical than killing someone to harvest organs. Are there philosophical differences between these two experiments? Or does it only feel different to me because of some non-philosophical factor (e.g. the way the experiment is packaged, the different in my subjective emotional response, etc.)? 

In discussion of Aristotle's natural philosophy, the concept of "generation and corruption" is often invoked. It's the translated of one of his books' title (On Generation and Corruption). Today in everyday's use the words "generation" and "corruption" are quite generic, but when talking about Aristotle's physics it seems that they refer to specific concept(s). What do they mean and how do they help the study of nature? To my mind, matters don't actually get "generated" or "corrupted" in everyday events, they just change. For example, water becomes ice, hydrocarbon + oxygen become carbon dioxide + water, and so on. But that's me, who, unlike Aristotle, studied modern physics and chemistry. In Aristotle's day, what were generation and corruption and how did they explain natural phenomena? 

European colonialism in Asia and Africa last well into the modern age. Most Asian countries only became independent after WW II, and Most African nations became independent only in the 1950's and 1960's. That is way after the enlightenment, after the French Revolution (liberty, equality, ..) and after the likes of Locke, Kant and Hobbes. My limited understanding of those thinkers is that the legitimacy of government come from social contracts, consent of the governed, democracy - government as the agent of the governed, and freedom. These all seem to contradict the legitimacy of colonial governments, which exploit foreign nation for their advantage by the force of arms. Divine rights and natural law might be used to justify colonialism, but after the enlightenment it seems that these theories are obsolete. What are the common philosophical justifications of colonialism in the 19th and 20th century? How did they address the lack of consent, freedom and democratic rights of the governed?
