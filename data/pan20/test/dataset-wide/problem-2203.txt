The difference is that an ordinary free agent can sign whenever. An undrafted player who is in a college program can be signed if he is 20, and only after the final game of his college team's season.... and only after being undrafted two times. So the NHL can't bust a top contending college team apart by grabbing their star players in the middle of the championship playoffs, making the entire playoff tournament a farce in the process. NHL.com - Top college free agents who could sign with NHL teams Now, why does a player good enough to be a Hobey Baker finalist manage to be undrafted? We're talking about late teens to early 20s. That's a period of rapid physical, mental and emotional development/maturing for any young adult. He might not be the same type of player he was coming out of high school. It's the same reason why you might see a player who was not offered a football or basketball scholarship, then not drafted by a pro team go on to have successful careers. Sometimes their potential doesn't really get unlocked until they are in the right situation, and sometimes teams just miss when they evaluate. Also, since the very top talent usually go straight to top-tier minor league programs, being a very good college player does not translate into hockey success like being a top player in college football or basketball. Even looking at the list of Hobey Baker winners, let alone finalists, you don't see a lot of superstars. Spencer Foo doesn't seem to be, especially, considered to be a shoo-in for greatness, at this point, because of his fine college career. I'm not sure that this is really all that remarkable. 

So your only option would be playing a safety (possibly resulting in a stalemate) or trying to run the table. 

The more telling statistics for a wicket keeper in the field are the number of dropped catches and missed stumpings per match. In the professional game, you would expect the wicketkeeper to catch all but the most difficult chances, and to cleanly gather the ball and attempt a stumping whenever possible. An example of this is when the England wicketkeeper Matt Prior was dropped for the series against New Zealand in 2008. The explanation by the Chairman of selectors was 

(my translation, and my bold) I assume these biathlons with skates are mostly locally organized, and the local shooting club (Schützenverein) would have details. One link I found was of a team relay event in Saxony 

There can be a large deviation of match length in the cricket world cup, consider the following two matches from the 2015 world cup: 

At least two Swiss Wrestling (Schwingen) competitions are held every 6 years. The Umspunnen-Schwinget in Interlaken is held every 6 years. The last events were in 1999, 2006 (the 2005 event was postponed due to rain) and 2011. The next event will be in 2017. The Kilchberger Schwinget is also held every 6 years, with the last events in 2008 and 2014, and the next to be held in 2020. It is interesting to note that the biggest event, the Eidgenössisches Schwing- und Älplerfest is held every 3 years. Schwingen is not an Olympic sport, so there is no need to synchronize with the Olympics, but it may be an advantage for local festivals to avoid clashing with the national festival. 

If you think about the math, suspending a starting "field" player for five games prevents that player from contributing to his team for the next five games. If a pitcher was only going to be able to contribute in a meaningful way for that one start over that period, a five game rip, even though it really only affects one start, still has the same result of the player not being able to contribute for five games. Plus, you never know what might happen. If the pitcher is slated to start game 1 and they have to move to a temporarily shortened rotation (Game 3 pitcher gets food poisoning), it could cost him two starts. If they get into a marathon extra inning game, that pitcher is not available to pitch to a single left-handed batter in the 18th inning as the manager perhaps would have wanted. In any scenario, the same net effect of not being able to contribute to five games holds. If you had a non-pitching bench player who was a backup and used mostly as a substitute or pinch hitter, how would that be evaluated for suspension for involvement in a bench-clearing brawl? Would they also require a different kind of calculus? Generally, with rules, the simpler they can keep it, the less subjective it is and the less opportunity for controversy over arbitrary treatment of one player vs another. 

There are many skills you need to learn, and you need to find a team that practice regularly and will give you time to learn from them. Passing, receiving a pass, shooting and tackling are all obvious things that any player needs to do. But coming from Rugby I would suggest two things that may be alien at first 

The obvious scenario for this is a player being booked for any reason, then showing obvious dissent to the referee, and receiving a second yellow card before play is restarted. An example of this happened to Brad Evans, captain of the Seattle Sounders, in a match against Colorado Rapids in April 2016. The match report shows two yellows in the 86th Minute: 

So in total both players have gained 0.5 shots from tee to green. So we could make a definition that SGtee-to-green is 

The New England Patriots (NFL) and the New England Revolution (MLS) both play in Foxborough in the Greater Boston area. I would argue that similar to Cubs turning into Bears, the Patriots (Adams/Revere et al, not Bellichek and Brady) started with protests in Boston, including a well known incident with a tea shipment, before taking up armed hostilities in Massachusetts. This later turned into a Revolution with the support of the other 12 colonies. 

If you mean - does that make them the only winning team never to lead during regulation time? While the play time stopped with the score, technically, the score happened at that time, so they were officially leading during game time (the last official second of the game), I believe. The answer is yes. Since no other Super Bowl game has ever gone to overtime before, that means all other winning teams led during regulation time. 

I think you have it right, and while, perhaps, the rule was originally intended with bench interference in mind, the wording, being as it is and not "from the bench," was clearly intended to cover the scenario you laid out. If you're going to award a best answer for this, you need to post the second part of your question, yourself and award it to yourself, since you did all the lifting on this one. 

The main benefit is going to be insurance coverage. Many facilities require sports team participants to be registered with an organization that offers insurance coverage, so they don't have to go through the process of getting additional coverage, and then documenting people covered to the satisfaction of their facility's insurance carrier. This coverage usually covers the team against liability and medical claims, and covers participants for medical costs if injured during an organized activity (practice, training, competition). 

Contacting the Swedish FA, as suggested by TrueDub, seems the obvious step given that you are in Sweden. For the UK, it would be a similar procedure, get in contact with either the FA (England) or the scottish FA (Scotland), who both seem keen on recruiting new referees. Link to FA (England) website on how to get started refereeing Link to Scottish FA website on how to get started refereeing (note the opportune advertising deal in scotland by the way!) 

Your experienced in the bar of an initial improvement, then a decline, has also been studied in a controlled environment. Researchers T. Reilly and J. Scott summarized their study as follows: 

Alan Davidson for Australia (scores 44 and 80) Ian Botham for England (score 114, batted once) Imran Khan for Pakistan (score 117, batted once) Shakib al Hasan for Bangladesh (scores 137 and 6) 

So for optimal performance, you need to keep your alcohol level fairly low but non-zero. The blood alcohol level depends on a lot of factors:, including: 

But if a quarterback does get injured, the team's fortunes usually suffer. The QB is involved in every offensive play, needs to make critical throws and also make on-field decisions about plays, so an injured quarterback is a major issue for the team.
