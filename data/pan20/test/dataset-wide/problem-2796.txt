I know that Mauro's answer is what you were looking for. However, in group theory, the term 'identity' has another meaning, which may be the one people coming here from search engines will be looking for. For example, in an additive group (that is, a set of numbers with the + operation; e.g. (N, +)), the identity is 0, because x + 0 = x, for every x. In logic, we can define the set B={T,F} and the group (B, ∧). That would give the identity element T, because both T∧T≡T and F∧T≡F. In the group (B, ∨) we have identity element F, for similar reasons. Also (B, ↔) has an identity; T. Since → is not commutative, it can have both a left and a right identity. It has a left identity: T, because both T→T≡T and T→F≡F. However, it does not have a right identity because neither x=T nor x=F gives F→x≡F. Since (B, →) doesn't have a common identity, it isn't a group. 

This would not work. Suppose you have ten books, five of which are overdue, and five not. The sentence "At least two of my library books are overdue" is true, as is "At least two of my library books are not overdue". You always have to apply the negation to the outermost part of the expression you're negating. Here, you put the negation somewhere inside, which causes problems. 

It's a madman talking here, but it's assumed that Nietzsche referred to himself. In the end, the madman leaves: 

The same, mathematically. Suppose we have a set X and a predicate P. Then Y = {x &in; X &mid; P x} and N = {x &in; X | ¬P x} partition X, that is, Y ∪ N = X and Y ∩ N = &emptyset;. Since "the stronger the restriction, the narrower the class", Y will be smaller when P is stronger. And since N = X &setminus; Y, this means that N will be greater, therefore, ¬P will be weaker. A similar argument can be made when P gets weaker: Y will be greater, so N smaller, therefore, ¬P will be stronger. 

This must be a typo in the text book: in the case that ∀x: Tet(x) ∧ ¬Cube(x) the premises are both true (provided there is at least one x), but the conclusion obviously does not hold. However, you can prove that the promises entail ∃x: Tet(x). 

NB: see Mozibur Ullah's comment on the question for a way to argue that this argument is invalid (in which case it would directly be unsound); however, in that case I would say the examiner is a little bit pathetic. I don't know your examiner, but is it possible that this was a trick question? An argument is sound when it's valid and its premises are true. Therefore, to determine soundness you need to determine validity and truth. To determine validity, you need to answer the question: "would it be possible that the conclusion is false while all premises are true?" If so, then the argument is invalid. If not, the argument is valid. Determining truth... well, let's just say that's more complicated! If your examiner insists that you can determine the soundness of that argument, you could show him the definitions of soundness and validity, preferably from your book, but if they are not there, from the IEP would be sufficient: 

We had this little discussion in class. Are your actions for every type of determinism determined before your birth? We're discussing traditional theories, so Quantum Mechanics aren't relevant (yet). I'd say yes, because determinism doesn't accept external factors, therefore the new situation necessarily follows up on the old situation and, with mathematical induction, therefore up on all old situation, also before your birth. But is this also true for social determinism? Then, your actions are determined by other actions, the social situation. Can your actions already be determined before those other actions have been performed? Again, I'd say yes. If your actions are determined by other actions, so are the actions of others. Therefore you can go back and back in time until before your birth. I realize my whole reasoning depends on that I say that determinism does not accept external factors. Is that true? Also, for my reasoning, I cannot have people with free will, then at least the reasoning for social determinism is invalid. But determinism goes for everyone, if it goes for anyone, right (according to determinism)? Am I correct, or is there any form of determinism possible where your actions are not determined before your birth? 

In temporal logic, you consider words, infinite sequences of sets of atomic propositions. So, an atomic proposition could be 'rain' and the word {},{rain},{},{rain},... would mean that it isn't raining today, it is raining tomorrow, it isn't raining the day after tomorrow, etc. (if we take a day as the step). A word can satisfy a formula. For example, the word above satisfies the formula "next: rain". So, whereas in propositional logic and friends you consider just one set of atomic propositions, and check if it satisfies some formula, in temporal logic you consider an infinite sequence of sets of atomic propositions: this sequence represents all states in time. Because of this you can make claims about things in the future. 

Your examples do claim that something (eating meat; eating animals) is good because it's found in nature (history of the human race; other animals). 

The guy in the video is wrong. He says: we can know things without the sensible world, for example: you know your great(...)grandma has lived because you're here, yet you cannot sense her. However, the fact your great(...)grandma has lived relies on physical evidence that you exist. Therefore, this isn't an example of knowledge without information from the senses. Induction You cannot get to absolute knowledge with only induction. This is commonly explained with swans: if you have seen 1, 2, 3, ..., n white swans, that doesn't make it arguable there are no black swans (unless you've seen all swans, of course). Someone who does something like that, isn't working rationally. Here's how induction works, you can easily see this isn't a valid reasoning: 

translates into propositional logic to (C1 ∧ C2 ∧ ... ∧ Cn ∧ (P → Q)) → X. This can be evaluated as usually with the truth table above, but this may be easier in natural language. Per the above, the quoted expression is equivalent with 

You're not looking at that mind as an end in itself, but merely as a goal to achieve something (helping other human beings), so with Kant one could argue that this is indeed unethical. However, and that will apply to many ethics, Kant wrote his ethics in a time that we could only think of ethics in the context of interacting humans. Whether or not you want to expand that to 'artificial intelligences' (which is an ill-defined term) is an important, non-trivial, question. One could for example argue that since computer programs are not human beings, our actions can be considered neither ethical nor unethical towards them, as ethics only applies to human beings and the terms right and wrong would not have a meaning except within the context of inter-human relations. I think your terms are a little ill-defined to discuss this seriously. For example: what are 'truly intelligent', 'aware', 'living', 'mind', 'computer program', 'happiness, 'satisfaction', 'free will', 'mind/brain design', 'truly alive', 'enslaved'? Of course, we all have an idea of these terms, but everyone uses them with a slightly different meaning. It's then hard to qualify the things you're talking about, which is needed in order to see if we're allowed to apply a certain theory of ethics in this particular case. 

... cannot be applied on a set of items. You cannot reasonably consider an infinite amount of apples. When you apply the quote on space, it makes sense: take a part from nothing, and it still is nothing, as big as it was. 

And similarly for the others. Note that the last equivalence actually gives you something of the form P(?)Q, with ?=∨Q∧¬. 

means 'exclusive or', so out of 7 instructions here, 3 use a logical operation. And this is not just something that happens in assembly. My Python implementation of the same cipher uses logic intensively as well. But also think of bitmasks and other uses of logic in computing science. Logic teaches you to think, and to reason precisely and correctly. It teaches you to recognise hidden assumptions. All this is incredibly useful in different fields - philosophy, but also science. 

Something can be both a cause and an effect at the same time. B is the effect of A, and B is the cause of C. C is an (indirect) effect of A, so A (indirectly) causes C. So, both your suggestions are correct. A causes the cause of C, so the cause of C (B) is an effect of A. 

You are correct that this means that when you remove the subject, there is no knowable reality anymore. The phenomena might exist, but that subject that has been removed cannot know it, and since he is removed, he cannot know the things like they are to him either. You have no physical information from the senses about history: you have never been there. That means the image you have of history or the world without humans is purely based on the world as it is now (not as it has been) and fiction. You only have read history books, seen pictures, etc., and all that makes you able to imagine a world like it is described. However, that image of the world does not come from the senses at all. It's fantasy. The same goes for imagining a world without humans. That isn't based on information from the senses but on fantasy. This is how these worlds seem to exist in your mind, however they did not come from the senses. Imagining a world without minds is no objection against mind dependent reality because in that case you'd still need your own mind to imagine it. The point Kant makes is that you cannot imagine such a world with knowledge. 

Premise: all horses are brown Premise: X is a horse Conclusion: from premise 1 and 2 follows that X is brown 

Even though god regrets having made "the human race ... and with them the animals, the birds and the creatures that move along the ground", wickedness (רע) is only reserved for humans (v. 5). So, abstracting, you see that there does not need to be an inconsistency if you reserve the concept of sin for humans. Whether the Jewish/Christian god thinks homosexuality is a sin is another issue that is not on topic here.
