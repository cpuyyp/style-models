The paint fumes are unlikely to be toxic (I hope!) - but it would be worth carrying out a Health and Safety check just to make sure. In extreme cases, paint fumes in enclosed spaces can kill. The best way to get rid of smells is not to cover them up. We're at the tail end of summer now, so I would suggest keeping your windows open for as long as the weather remains mild. Improve the ventilation, have someone in looking after the building over the weekend while you air it out. And get some plants to cheer up your employees :-) 

Ultimately, your personal life is your own business. As a manager, I would certainly respect your privacy - but it could become complex without a suitable "cover story." If I were you, I'd accept the fact that your co-workers may wish to buy you a cake and give you a "congratulations" card. 

They are right in the sense that HMRC will check how much you've been paid over the total year and then refund you if you've over-paid. Yes, the Tax Man does give money back! On to the final point, should you raise this? It is unlikely that you will lose out financially - but you have been inconvenienced and put through some stress. Your boss doesn't want you running off to the competition because you feel badly treated. In one of your regular catch ups, you should explain the situation in the simplest possible terms. Don't focus on who has screwed up - talk about how it has affected you. Don't get angry - just calmly say something like: 

It is usually sufficient to say something like "it's a personal matter that I don't feel comfortable discussing - I'll be back in on Thursday." If you trust your boss -and if you've read your company's sick-pay guidance - you could tell them the nature of your illness and whether you think you'll need more time off in the future. Generally speaking, you don't have to tell your boss why you're off - although you may need to share your doctor's note with your HR department. If your boss persists, it would be worth talking to their boss or HR department to get them to remind your boss about the law / company policy on asking employees about medical matters. 

For most work-based relationships (and even more if you have to ask the question), the answer is probably no. 

(Feel free to work on the phrasing, english is not my first language.) The point is, as you said: no-one has ever heard of a portfolio for science jobs, and you can't guess what they want. 

I can't comment on @Bojje 's good answer, so here's a tip: the problem is that this habit of sharing is already established, and getting back from there is proving to be quite complicated if you don't want to seem agressive towards your coworkers. Since it has become "normal" for them that you share, it would most likely be hard for them to understand why you would start saying no all of a sudden. (Did they do something wrong?) One solution might be to create two different types of snacking: 

A resignation letter is a formal and legal document, I'd keep it simple and stick to facts - you don't have to "regret" anything in a resignation letter. You just inform the company that you are leaving on [date]. Then, depending on your relationship with your boss, two options: 

If the company itselfs sells "art objects" but this time is looking for an horticulture intern, I would bet that they copy/pasted their usual job offer, and changed the job description but forgot to change the generic part about sending a resume and portfolio. I would send a full "classic" application - with detailed CV including achievements etc, and motivation letter - and add something to the email along the lines of: 

If the bookshelf-moving happens at work, it is a reasonable favor to ask: the task is probably not in his job description, but neither too complicated or time consuming. The rest is assuming that it is a personal favor (outside of work in terms of place and hours). Simple question to ask yourself: do you have this type of personal relationship with your colleague, on occasions where you don't need a favor? The real question behind that is, do you have a relationship where you are not his boss? 

Have you tried just asking for a Skype interview? I'm assuming the professor knows that you are abroad, so it should appear as a normal demand, and definitely not rude. It happens all the time. Your request doesn't have to mention expenses, you can point out that it would be more convenient for everyone - especially since travel time and planning would introduce a delay. Something sending the message "Thank you for your offer and I'm really excited about meeting everyone in team B, however I have no planned trip to country X any time soon, but I would be available immediately for a Skype interview" should do the trick. If they insist on meeting in person, then you can think again about how much you want the job (or not!) and if it is worth the traveling expenses. Then of course if you go further in the recruitement process, you will have to meet them at some point, but it can definitely wait until after the first interview. 

Essentially, you're saying (quite truthfully) that you want to do more technical work. You're not badmouthing your former employer. You're not doing yourself down. You're pointing out that you're interested in improving yourself. Good luck! 

Your annual review should not bring up any surprises. Ideally, you should be having regular (monthly / quarterly) meetings with your boss to discuss your work, whether you're hitting your targets, and whether you have any issues. As part of this, you should find out what your company's goals are and how you are expected to help them achieve those goals. Your job title is "Computer Programmer" - but programming a Tetris playing AI is probably not why a Widget Manufacturer hired you. Let's take an example. Company Goal Save money by reducing customer complaints. Your Goal Reduce customer facing bugs in the codebase. Your Achievements Reported bugs A,B,C. Fixed bugs X,Y,Z. This saved the company an estimated £££. Next Years Goals Find a way to reduce the number of support calls caused by $foo. Rewrite the codebase in Python. 

Yes, you should be looking for a new job if that's how they're treating you. In the meantime, there are two people you need to speak to. 

It's quite common that a reference check is just HR talking to another HR department. Occasionally, as a manager, I'll get an email asking me to confirm that Alice Smith worked for me from date X to date Y. References, in this litigious age, are almost never personal. I don't think I've ever come across a "Yeah, well, I wouldn't hire them again!" reference. As I'm sure you know, the Equality Act 2010 makes it unlawful for an employer to discriminate due to gender identity. You don't have to reveal your past name, but it may be practical to do so. This is an issue that women often face if they change their name after marriage. Do you contact all your old employers and ask them to update their systems, or do you put your previous name on your CV and alert the company that you're married? Personally, I wouldn't mention any of this to a potential employer - I would only mention it to HR. Individual managers may not fully understand their responsibilities under the Equality Act - but a professional HR department should. My suggestion is twofold. 

Transferring the in-game frustration in a professional context is pretty childish... With childish people, I find that the best solution is often to wait for them to calm down (let's be honest, he's probably waiting for you to apologize and beg him to come back to the guild with his huge skill and all, and there's no way you should do that). If you don't have to actually work with him, just keep being being friendly as you would with any other coworker, and he'll come around at some point - maybe as people will notice he's ignoring you, and start asking why, he'll realize the futility of it all. If you have to work together and his behaviour is having a negative effect, you might consider saying something neutral like "Look, I know it didn't end well with the guild, we probably both overreacted, but can we please get over it and just work together?". (Note: in my opinion, he overreacted, not you, but it often helps to take part of the blame, and your end goal there is to get him to talk to you). 

And if you want to stop giving out snacks at all, just slowly reduce the frequency of sharing snacks until you stop completely! 

I would say that the question is not whether you know the name of the person handling the cover letters, but rather if you are sending your application to a specific person (if the contact information provided in the offer is that of a specific person, and not jobs@company.com). In that case, yes, address the letter to them. (As you would address the e-mail containing your application to them directly, right?) In all other circumstances, it doesn't matter. What you should research and mention in your letter, is the company (and the team/service, if it's a big company), why you would like to work there and be a great addition to the team. Mention the company/team by name and name specific examples that prove you took the time to address your letter to them, and that it's not a template sent to a hundred other HR services. The name of the person has no importance whatsoever, and as you said, the letter is bound to be read by several recruiters and team member. They know the application is going around, and they will not care if the name on the top is theirs or someone else's or a generic greeting. What they will care about is the content. As for the name, do whatever you are comfortable with! 

There's an old Polish proverb - "not my circus, not my monkeys." This is not your responsibility. You should not be meddling in this - especially as you are a representative of your company. 

In my experience, it is rare for a hiring manager to conduct a reference / background check themselves. For sensitive personal matters, try to deal with HR exclusively. Best of luck in all your endeavours. 

Now, will this level of "constructive criticism" get back to your colleague? Possibly. Why haven't you raised this directly with him? Or his manager? 

You have your firm answer. It has been two months and they are not interested in your application. I'm sorry - some companies just don't care about informing candidates that they haven't been successful. It's time for you to forget this company and move on. If they do (eventually) come back to you - do you really want to work for people who treat potential employees with such disrespect? 

Firstly, you are right. As an interviewer I think it would reflect poorly on you if the call is constantly interrupted by noise. Secondly, modern mobile phones are pretty good at blocking out background noise. Try making some test calls to friends - or have them call you from your home - and see just how good or bad the call quality is. It is your responsibility to find a quiet place to take a call. If you want this job, you may have to go to a little extra effort. 

Side projects are a great way to demonstrate to a potential employer that you actually know your stuff. Don't think of them as side projects - think of it as a portfolio. I'm sure you have classmates who have somehow managed to pass their degree without any discernible talent. As a hiring manager, how do I differentiate your CV from theirs? Showing off side projects gives me the following assurances. 

Volunteer. Find a local charity which is looking for help. It won't necessarily earn you any money, but it will help you get used to what the modern workforce is like - and they will be able to provide you with references. Your local government may have a "Labour Exchange" or "Job Centre". Go to them and explain that you want to work. They should be able to help you write your CV / Resume. They will know which local employers are willing to take on new recruits with no references. Telephone local job agencies. Again, explain your situation. They may know who in the area is hiring people with your skills.
