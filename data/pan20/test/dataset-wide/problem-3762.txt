Yes, the square root of a line bundle $L$ is a line bundle $L'$ such that $(L')^{\otimes 2} \simeq L.$ I don't know of any general criteria for detecting the existence of a square root. A couple basic observations: 

I think a good illustration of why torsion-free sheaves on singular curves are both interesting and difficult is given by the following. Consider the $GL_n$ case of the Hitchin fibration, i.e., the map from the moduli space of vector bundles of rank $n$ with a twisted endomorphism on a smooth, projective curve to the Hitchin base space of characteristic polynomials. Then a result of Beauville, Naramsihan, and Ramanan (see this paper $URL$ says that for a sufficiently nice characteristic polynomial $a$ in the Hitchin base, the stack of torsion-free coherent sheaves of rank one on the associated spectral curve is isomorphic to the Hitchin fiber associated to $a$. See, for example, the notes on the Hitchin fibration on Drinfeld's geometric Langlands page for a quick introduction to these ideas. In general, these spectral curves will be singular (which is why I couldn't simply say 'line bundle' in the above correspondence). Given that the Hitchin fibration and Hitchin fibers are some of the most interesting geometric objects currently being studied, I think this gives a flavor for how interesting torsion-free sheaves on singular curves (and these are just rank one) can be. Also, it's worth mentioning that the curves which arise as spectral curves aren't even that singular (nodal and cuspidal elliptic curves are a couple examples), in the sense that the dimension of the tangent space at any point is at most two. There's an old result (I think from 1979) of Altman, Iarrobino, and Kleiman proving that in this situation, the stack of line bundles is dense in the stack of torsion-free coherent sheaves of rank one. This result has since been generalized to arbitrary reductive groups by Ngo in his paper proving the Fundamental Lemma. 

I don't know if this is exactly what you're looking for (and there's a good chance you already know what I'm going to write) but let me give it a try: The realization functor of cyclic sets (not spaces!) to $S^1$-spaces can be made part of a Quillen equivalence for two of the three commonly desired model structures on $S^1$-spaces: The model structure that gives you "Spaces over $BS^1$" is given in a 1985 paper of Dwyer-Hopkins-Kan, while a model structure that gives you the equivalences that you want (i.e., checked on fixed sets for finite subgroups) is given in a 1995 paper "Strong homotopy theory of cyclic sets" by Jan Spalinksi. (Irrelevant to your question, but along the same lines: A recent paper of Andrew Blumberg describes how one can throw in some extra--still combinatorial--data and obtain a combinatorial model of the third desirable model structure on $S^1$-spaces, namely where equivalences are those that induce equivalences on fixed sets for all closed subgroups.) Spalinksi's model structure depends on the following construction of $|X_{.}|^{C_n}$ (as a space-over-$BS^1$) in terms of the subdivision construction: The simplicial set $(sd_r X)_n = X_{r(n+1)-1}$ has an action of $C_r$--since $C_r$ is a subgroup of the copy of $C_{r(n+1)}$ acting on $X_{r(n+1)-1}$; taking fixed points (in sSet) and then realizing gives $|X_{.}|^{C_n}$. This suggests (though I haven't checked too carefully) that remembering each $X_n$ as a $C_{n+1}$-space (in the sense you suggest, with subgroups) is enough, as you expected. 

Drinfeld and Simpson's B-Structures on G-Bundles and Local Triviality, Mathematical Research Letters 2, 823-829 (1995) comes in at under seven pages and has been quite important in all the work done on principal G-bundles (such as the geometric Langlands' program). In particular, it proved the double quotient description of G-bundles on curves (for reductive G) which had previously only been proved for $G = SL_n$ by Beauville and Laszlo. The paper can be found here. 

First recall that $Sym^k(V)$ is the irreducible representation of highest weight $k$. So, it has weight spaces with weights $-k,-k+2,\ldots,k-2,k$ occurring with multiplicity one. In particular, $Sym^3(V)$ has weights $-3,-1,1,3$. Then the weights occurring in $Sym^k(Sym^3(V))$ correspond to all possible ways of adding $k$ of the weights $-3,-1,1,3$ together. For example, $3k$ will be a weight occurring, and in fact it will be the highest weight, corresponding to the fact that $Sym^{3k}(V)$ will always be a direct summand of $Sym^k(Sym^3(V))$. Having found all the weights, you know need to know the multiplicity with which they occur. For example, the reason that $Sym^3(Sym^2(V)) = Sym^6(V) \oplus Sym^2(V)$ is that the weights $-6,-4,\ldots,6$ all occur, but the weights $-2,0,2$ all occur with multiplicity two. 

In regards to your specific question regarding the canonical line bundle of $\mathbb{P}^1,$ this is easy. The canonical bundle is $\mathcal{O}(-2),$ and its square root is the tautological line bundle $\mathcal{O}(-1).$ Since isomorphism classes of line bundles on $\mathbb{P}^1$ are determined completely by their degree, a line bundle on $\mathbb{P}^1$ has a square root if and only if its degree is even. 

For an element in the conjugacy class of $S_n$ indexed by the partition $\lambda$, it's centralizer has cardinality $A(\lambda) B(\lambda)$, i.e., the number of elements in the conjugacy class is $$\frac{n!}{A(\lambda) B(\lambda)}$$ Take the character matrix $M$. The orthogonality relations tells us that a suitable rescaling of the character matrix is orthogonal, so has $\det = \pm 1$. From this, together with 1 to find the scaling factors for the columns, we obtain $$ (\det M)^2 = \prod_{\lambda} A(\lambda) B(\lambda) $$ $M$ relates two bases for the spaces of class-functions: The characters of irreps (indexed in the Schur ordering by partitions), and the delta functions on conjugacy classes (indexed obviously by partitions). For symmetric groups, there is a third nice basis: For $\lambda \vdash n$, let $$ S_\lambda = \prod_{i=1}^{n} S_i^{\lambda_i} $$ and consider the characters of the induced reps $Ind_{S_\lambda}^{S_n} \mathbb{C}$. Consider the change of basis matrix relating characters of induced reps and the delta functions on conjugacy classes: Easy character theory shows that it is triangular with diagonal entries equal to $B(\lambda)$. Consider the change of basis matrix relating characters of induces reps and characters of irreps: Knowing how character theory for symmetric groups works over $\mathbb{Z}$ (i.e., that both span integrally), we can show that it has determinant $\pm 1$. More precisely, knowing the character theory well enough we can show that the change of basis matrix between them is upper triangular with ones on the diagonal. 

You can use connectedness to prove that $\mathbb{R}$ is not homeomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^n$ for any n>1 by noting that $\mathbb{R} \backslash 0$ is not connected while $\mathbb{R}^n \backslash 0$ is connected. The students may not be very impressed by this as it is telling them something they probably already assumed was true. I suppose that if you wanted them to discover cohomology, you could challenge them to find a reason why Euclidean spaces of different dimensions are never homeomorphic (I realize that this probably isn't very reasonable). 

No, a ring will always be free viewed as a module over itself, but its ideals certainly don't have to be free. For example, consider the ring $R = k[t]/t^2$ and consider the submodule $I = (t),$ the ideal generated by $t$. Then $R \to I$ by multiplication by $t$ and has kernel $I$. It's then easy to see that $\ldots \to R \to R \to I \to 0$ is an infinite free resolution of $I$ where each map is multiplication by $t$. 

Then these Dynkin diagrams correspond to all possible finite subgroups of $SL_2.$ The relation is given by special classes of isolated surface singularities known as Kleinian or Du Val singularities. These arise as follows. Given a finite subgroup $G \subset SL_2,$ we have an action of $G$ on $\mathbb{C}^2$ with no fixed points other than the origin. If we then look at the geometric quotient $\mathbb{C}^2/G$ corresponding to $G$-invariant polynomials in $\mathbb{C}[x,y],$ it is generated by three homogeneous polynomials $f_1, f_2, f_3$ which are related by a weighted homogeneous polynomial $g$ of degree 3 such that $g(f_1, f_2, f_3) = 0.$ We can then identify $\mathbb{C}^2/G$ with the hypersurface $\{ g = 0 \} \subset \mathbb{C}^3.$ The resulting hypersurfaces have the following equations (with corresponding subgroup): 

If $X$ is smooth and proper, GAGA does in fact suffice (despite the observation that $d$ is not $\mathcal{O}_X$-linear: One obtains a comparison map of hypercohomology spectral sequences; it is an isomorphism on the $E_2$ page by GAGA, and thus on the $E_\infty$ page. It is to prove the general case (i.e., $X$ smooth but not necessarily proper) that one needs to do additional work. 

Restricting to Aff is certainly enough, but Aff isn't small (there are e.g., polynomial algebras on arbitrary sets). If your DM stack is finitely presented over $k$ (which is probably good to include in the definition, to avoid these issues), then it is determined by it's restriction to finitely-presented affines (which is essentially small). Without some finiteness hypothesis, no set of finitely-presented algebras can suffice (even for affine schemes, nevermind DM stacks). (And I suppose no small category of test objects can suffice: Take Spec of a field generated by a set of cardinality larger than that of global sections of any of your test schemes.) The set you give is insufficient even for smooth varieties over an alg. closed field: you will have a morphism whenever you have an (arbitrary) map on $k$-points. 

Now begins the speculative (and probably wrong) part of this answer: I have nothing too certain to say about writing this as a functor category, but it doesn't seem too unreasonable (to me, right now, at least) based on the above simplicial subdivision construction that we might be able to construct a reasonable candidate: some sort of mix of the cyclic category and the orbit categories for the cyclic groups. Purely combinatorially, this seems to get tricky. But, I think we can realize this geometrically: Let $(S^1)_r$ be the circle equipped with a $\mathbb{Z}$ action given by the rotation by $2\pi/r$. We could try to define $Hom'([m-1]_r, [m'-1]_{r'})$ along the lines of "(htpy classes of) degree $r'/r$, increasing $\mathbb{Z}$-equivariant maps $S^1 \to S^1$ sending the $mr$-torsion points to the $m' r'$-torsion points". This should correspond to taking all the $r$-cyclic categories and sticking them together, and in particular is bigger than what we want. But, the $\mathbb{Z}$-action on the circles should induce one on the $Hom'$-sets and the composition should respect it. Taking the quotient, we seem to get something that looks like a reasonable candidate. For each fixed $r$, we should be getting a copy of the cyclic category. And, e.g. $Hom([m-1]_r, [mr-1]_1)$ should contain $Hom_{orbit}(Z/mr, Z/r)$. (Disclaimer: It's late and I haven't checked any of this too carefully!)
