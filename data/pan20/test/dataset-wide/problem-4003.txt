I found the answer of my own question. In the paper "Hencl, Stanislav; Kleprlík, Luděk; Composition of q-quasiconformal mappings and functions in Orlicz-Sobolev spaces. Illinois J. Math. 56 (2012), no. 3, 931–955." The authors proved that the equation ($\ast$) holds provided that $\Phi\in\Delta^{\prime}$, i.e. there exist $C>0$ such that $$\Phi(x y)\leq C \Phi(x)\Phi(y)\text{ for every }x,y\geq 0.$$ They also add a remark such that: "Surprisingly we cannot have ($\ast$) for general Young functions, because the term $\|\chi_{B(x,r)}\|$ does not necessarily scale well for small $r$. For $\alpha<0$ we construct a function $f\in L^q\log^{\alpha}L$ such that the limit in ($\ast$) is infinite everywhere. " 

As is well known, Morrey spaces are widely used to investigate the local behavior of solutions to second order elliptic partial differential equations. Recall that the classical Morrey spaces $\mathcal{M}^{p,\lambda}(\mathbb{R}^{n})$ are defined by \begin{equation*} \mathcal{M}^{p,\lambda}(\mathbb{R}^{n}) = \left\{ f \in L^p_{\rm loc}(\mathbb{R}^{n}) : \left\| f\right\|_{\mathcal{M}^{p,\lambda}}: = \sup_{x \in \mathbb{R}^{n}, \; r>0 } r^{-\frac{\lambda}{p}} \|f\|_{L^p (B(x,r))} < \infty \right\}, \end{equation*} where $0 \le \lambda \le n,$ $1\le p < \infty$. Note that $\mathcal{M}^{p,0}(\mathbb{R}^{n})=L^{p}(\mathbb{R}^{n})$ and $\mathcal{M}^{p,n}(\mathbb{R}^{n})=L^{\infty}(\mathbb{R}^{n})$. If $\lambda<0$ or $\lambda>n$, then $\mathcal{M}^{p,\lambda }(\mathbb{R}^{n})={\Theta}$, where $\Theta$ is the set of all functions equivalent to $0$ on $\mathbb{R}^{n}$. Indeed, first let $\lambda<0$ and $f\in \mathcal{M}^{p,\lambda}(\mathbb{R}^{n})$, then we have for all $x\in\mathbb{R}^{n}$ and $r>0$ \begin{align*} \|f\|_{L^{p}(B(x,r))}\le r^{\frac{\lambda}{p}}\| f\|_{\mathcal{M}^{p,\lambda }}. \end{align*} Consequently we get $$ \|f\|_{L^{p}(\mathbb{R}^{n})}=\lim_{r\rightarrow \infty}\|f\|_{L^{p}(B(x,r))}=0\Rightarrow f(x)=0, \text{ for a.e. }x\in\mathbb{R}^{n}. $$ Now let $\lambda>n$ and $f\in \mathcal{M}^{p,\lambda}(\mathbb{R}^{n})$. Then, we have for all $x\in\mathbb{R}^{n}$ and $r>0$ \begin{align}\tag{*} \frac{\|f\chi_{B(x,r)}\|_{L^p(\mathbb{R}^{n})}}{\|\chi_{B(x,r)}\|_{L^p(\mathbb{R}^{n})}}\le v_n^{-\frac{1}{p}} r^{\frac{\lambda-n}{p}}\| f\|_{\mathcal{M}^{p,\lambda }}, \end{align} where $v_n$ is the volume of the unit ball in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$. By the Lebesgue theorem on differentiation of integrals we know that for all $f\in L^p_{\rm loc}(\mathbb{R}^{n})$ \begin{align} \lim_{r\rightarrow 0} \frac{\|f\chi_{B(x,r)}\|_{L_p(\mathbb{R}^{n})}}{\|\chi_{B(x,r)}\|_{L^p(\mathbb{R}^{n})}}=|f(x)| \text{ for a.e. }x\in\mathbb{R}^{n}. \end{align} Using this fact in (*) we get $f(x)=0$ for a.e. $x\in\mathbb{R}^{n}$. By $W\mathcal{M}^{p,\lambda}(\mathbb{R}^{n})$ we denote the weak Morrey space defined as the set of functions $f\in WL^{p}_{\rm loc}(\mathbb{R}^{n}) $ for which $$ \left\| f\right\|_{W\mathcal{M}^{p,\lambda }} := \sup_{x\in \mathbb{R}^{n}, \; r>0} r^{-\frac{\lambda}{p}} \|f\|_{WL^{p}(B(x,r))} <\infty, $$ where $WL^{p}(B(x,r))$ denotes the weak $L^p$-space of measurable functions $f$ for which \begin{align*} \begin{split} \|f\|_{WL^{p}(B(x,r))} & \equiv \|f \chi_{_{B(x,r)}}\|_{WL^{p}(\mathbb{R}^{n})} \\ &= \sup_{t>0}t \left|\left\{y\in B(x,r) : \,|f(y)| > t \right\} \right|^{1/{p}} %\label{ISAAC2} \\ &=\sup_{0<t\le |B(x,r)|} t^{1/{p}} \left( f \chi_{_{B(x,r)}} \right)^{*}(t) <\infty. \end{split} \end{align*} Here $g^{*}$ denotes the non-increasing rearrangement of the function $g$. For the non-triviality of weak Morrey space where should $\lambda$ be? I think it is obvious that if $\lambda=0$ then $W\mathcal{M}^{p,0}(\mathbb{R}^{n})=WL^{p} (\mathbb{R}^{n})$ and if $\lambda<0$ then $W\mathcal{M}^{p,\lambda }(\mathbb{R}^{n})={\Theta}$. Also, for my opinion if $\lambda=n$ then \begin{align*} \begin{split} r^{-\frac{n}{p}} \|f\|_{WL^{p}(B(x,r))}&=r^{-\frac{n}{p}} \sup_{0<t\le |B(x,r)|} t^{1/{p}} \left( f \chi_{_{B(x,r)}} \right)^{*}(t)\\ &\leq v_{n}^{\frac{1}{p}}\left( f \chi_{_{B(x,r)}} \right)^{*}(0)\\ &\leq v_{n}^{\frac{1}{p}}\|f\|_{L^\infty(\mathbb{R}^{n})}. \end{split} \end{align*} So $L^\infty(\mathbb{R}^{n})\hookrightarrow W\mathcal{M}^{p,n}(\mathbb{R}^{n})$. What do you think about the embedding $W\mathcal{M}^{p,n}(\mathbb{R}^{n})\hookrightarrow L^\infty(\mathbb{R}^{n})$ ? Is it true? Also what do you think about the other cases of $\lambda$ ? For which cases of $\lambda$ the weak Morrey spaces are trivial? 

The sets $\{ (A(t),t)|t\in \mathbb{R} \} \subset \mathbb{R}^4$ and $\{ (B(t),t)|t\in \mathbb{R} \} \subset \mathbb{R}^4$ are convex, their intersection $K$ is a bounded convex set, and $f(t)$ is the volume of the slice of $K$ at height $t$. By Brunn-Minkowski inequality, this is log-concave, so definitely unimodal. 

The codimension of $\Sigma^2$-points in the source for a codimension $k$ map is $2(k+2)$, in this case that's $6>3$, so you only get combinations of Morin and regular points. From the Morins, the cusp has codimension $2(k+1)=4$, so you have no cusps either and need to keep track only of the regular points (codimension $k=1$ in the target) and fold points (canonical form $(x,y,z) \mapsto (x^2,xy,y,z)$, codimension $2k+1=3$ in the target). So, you have the regular points with multiplicity 1 to 4, the fold curves and fold curves intersecting transversally a regular "branch", and that's all. What you wrote does not look like a stable singularity to me. 

$E \oplus det E$ is orientable (its structure group $O(n)$ is represented in $SO(n+1)$), so its $w_1$ vanishes; and $w_1(E \oplus det E) = w_1(E) + w_1(det E)$. 

Think of $SU(n)$ as the space of orthonormed bases in $C^n$ with the additional property of the determinant being equal to $1$ out of all the unit length complex numbers. Then fixing one of the vectors restricts the others to the orthogonal hyperplane and the additional requirement remains intact for some parametrization of said hyperplane. In the coordinate system defined by such a base, all the others with the same first vector differ only by a matrix of the form $1 \oplus A$ with some $A \in SU(n-1)$. It does sound too much like a homework question to me though. 

A simplicial complex of dimension $d$ is called constructible if it is a simplex, or if it is the union of two constructible dimension-$d$ simplicial complexes along a dimension-$(d-1)$ intersection. Who first came up with this definition? I had thought it was M. Hochster [Ann. Math. 96 (1972), 318-337], but a number of sources cite E. Zeeman [Seminar on Combinatorial Topology, Fascicule 1, Expos\'es I \'a V inclus, Institut des Hautes Etudes Scientifiques, 1963]. I've looked at Zeeman's book and don't see where he considers this condition, even under a different name. Can anyone point to the appropriate part of Zeeman? (Disclosure: This is a referee's suggestion for a paper I am revising, and I would like to make the citation pinpoint if possible.) 

Suppose you have a triangular chessboard of size $n$, whose "squares" are ordered triples $(x,y,z)$ of nonnegative integers that add up to $n$. A rook can move to any other point that agrees with it in one coordinate -- for example, if you are on $(3,1,4)$ then you can move to $(2,2,4)$ or to $(6,1,1)$, but not to $(4,3,1)$. What is the maximum number of mutually non-attacking rooks that can be placed on this chessboard? More generally, is anything known about the graph whose vertices are these ordered triples and whose edges are rook moves? 

There are lots of good combinatorial examples that are not hard to define: e.g., posets, matroids, quasisymmetric functions, graphs. A few places to look: W. Schmitt, Incidence Hopf Algebras, J. Pure Appl. Algebra 96 (1994), no. 3, 299–330. W. Schmitt, Hopf algebra methods in graph theory, J. Pure Appl. Algebra 101 (1995), no. 1, 77–90. M. Aguiar, N. Bergeron, and F. Sottile, Combinatorial Hopf algebras and generalized Dehn-Sommerville relations, Compos. Math. 142 (2006), no. 1, 1–30. 

The easy way of comparing those is to check that they both satisfy the axioms and then use the unicity of the characteristic classes. The splitting lemma (every vector bundle can be pulled back from a sum of line bundles with a map that induces an injective map in cohomology) makes unicity trivial. As to the second question, vector bundles' total spaces are homotopically equivalent to their bases. Maybe you meant Thom spaces? In this latter case, you get $G_{n-1}$ from $\gamma_n$, and this is one of the ways to calculate the cohomology ring of $G_n$. 

Another way to look at the "official" solution is to notice that for statistical purposes it does not matter which couple gets the next child. You "request" children from the couples in whatever manner you want, you always get a 1:1 expected ratio in boys and girls, regardless of the pattern in which you choose the next couple to produce another child. 

I would also recommend Wall's Determination of the cobordism ring as a more primary source, it also contains the fact that all torsion is of order 2. 

I'll assume you're talking about principal G-bundles. These are classified by maps into $BG$, the base of the universal $G$-bundle, so if we have bundles classified by $f:E \to BG$ and $g:F \to BG$, you are looking for a bordism between $f$ and $g$ - whether there exists a $h : W \to BG$ connecting these classifying maps. So there is a bundle cobordism between the two bundles iff the bordism classes of $f$ and $g$ in $\mathfrak{N}n(BG)$ coincide, and if they do coincide, then the choice of $W$ is parametrized by the bordism group $\mathfrak{N}_{n+1}(BG)$. I don't know an algorithmic way to obtain the class $[f]$ from $E$, but there is a splitting $\mathfrak{N}_n(BG) = \oplus H_j(BG) \otimes \mathfrak{N}_{n-j}$ which can help identify some bundles' classes.
