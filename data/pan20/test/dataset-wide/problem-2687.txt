I don't think that the knowledge of death itself brings positive influence. It can swing both ways. It could also bring with it feelings of hopelessness and meaninglessness. However, I think that knowledge of how death fits into the grander cycle of life & death brings with it positive influence. Because death is not only about the end of a life, but also about what is left behind for the next life or lives to come. Personally, I believe that a person who looks at death as only being an ending, will ultimately either live life in fear or in detachment. But a who person who understands that death gives way to the next step in the cycle, which will be affected by the contributions made by him, can in a way become immortal, because he lives on through these contributions. One could argue that there might exist a person who is so absolutely corrupted and evil, that he would use knowledge of the cycle of life and death to bring more destruction. I guess you could say that in that persons eyes, the knowledge brought "positive" influence. But you could also say that that person is slowly bringing the cycle to an end, which ultimately wouldn't be "positive". But that would by definition be detachment from the ending (or fear of the ending, if he tries to artificially delay it), which would mean that the knowledge of the cycle of life and death was negative. But maybe what follows is a new cycle? People who try to artificially delay the ending of something important to them, are all over the world in different forms and shapes. Some people base their entire identity on a foundation that has an expiration date. Some parts of our entire civilization are based on foundations with expiration dates. 

It should be noted though that van Inwagen failed to consider a third option. A research by Thomas Breuer concluded that neither deterministic, nor indeterministic universally-valid theories are possible. That means that no theory can predict (even probabilistically) the future of a system which contains the observer himself due to self-reference problem. As such it seems that the free will of at least the observer can be saved while all other people will appear to him as following the laws of deterministic or random theory and as such, not possessing free will. Particularly, regarding quantum mechanics Breuer proves that a system which includes the observer has states in phase space which are in principle cannot be distinguished by observer himself however good measurement devices he would employ. Yet these states affect the future evolution of the system. This can be understood as that there is hidden information which real but unreadable by any physical device which affects the future behavior of the observer. 

I disagree with the end of the initial statement "The Judiciary generally holds the power to interpret the law based on the legislative intent" – they have the power to interpret the law, period, and "legislative intent" is just one of many theories of how to do that (one resoundingly rejected by Scalia, for example). The root of the problem is that there is very little by way of universal metatheory for judicial interpretation. This is a consequence of the nature of our common law system, as contrasted with statutory systems as found for example in Europe. It was the original purpose of judges to make wise and just decisions, to create law, not just interpret it. This explains much about the nature of judicial (mis)interpretation in the US. Our justices are simply carrying on a long tradition, where strict reading of objectively-stated law is not the primary principle behind rendering decisions. Generally speaking, justices are guided by the "meaning" behind a piece of written law. The principle stare decisis holds that once a "meaning" has been assigned to a piece of law, that meaning holds in all similar cases (though stare decisis is not actually enforceable). But justices have proven very adept at assigning all sorts of "meanings" to the words in a statute. If you believe that the "meaning" of a statute is the "intent" of the enacting Legislature plus executive, who make the law, you face the problem of establishing that there is indeed an intent. An individual can have an intent in voting some way (such as "get this thing passed so that I can go home, and not get crucified in November"), but getting from individual intent to "group intent" is probably impossible in principle (one reason is that no legislator ever reads and understands all of the bills that s/he votes on). Legislators are generally quite willing to pass unclear laws, in the hope that the courts will later define what the law means. The book The Language of Judges by L. Solan gives a nice catalog of subjective interpretations of essentially the same facts of legal language, depending on the justice in question. T. Smith has written a number of articles ("Why Originalism Won't Die"; "Originalism's Misplaced Fidelity: 'Original' Meaning is Not Objective") which addresses the problem of "meaning" most clearly (from a non-linguistic perspective). 

You are right. There is a part of universe which cannot be measured. The impossibility to measure this "last particle's" properties is known as subjuctive (de)coherence. In simple words, the observer can measure everything except himself. In each system that includes the observer there are states which the observer cannot distinguish however means he employs. You can see it as if the states were functions of themselves. This fact holds for any physical theory, but in quantum theory it is stronger than in classical. For more detailed information, refer to this paper: $URL$ 

Radioactive decay is such a system (the stuff we measure in a Geiger Counter). We are simply unable to make predictions about when radioactive particles decay because its impossible to detect the starting conditions and accurately simulate the system (due to Quantum theory, Heisenberg Uncertainty principle etc). All we can see is that it happens with no visible pattern. $URL$ is also such a system. In theory, if we had a magic instrument that could measure the starting conditions and then simulate the radioactive decay with 100% accuracy, it would only be as predictable as an random-number-generating algorithm for which you already knew the seed (the seed is a number that is essentially the starting condition for the algorithm). But who knows. Maybe such a magic device exists, and we have yet to find it. 

Peter van Inwagen in his "Metaphysics" (2009) explains point of view that both determinism and indeterminism (which he understands as randomness) are incompatible with free will. He concludes that as such, free will cannot exist or merely an illusion. 

You can conceive a universe where usual logic would not work, for instance, a universe where everything you believe or want or fear is true, or a universe where there is no logic, only some constant permanent sensation, but it will not be universe in the usual sense (it would not be possible to describe it in formal language). But if you take the level of the most abstract qualia, you can conceive a qualia flow that would break usual laws of logic. In a sense it would be somewhat similar to a sleeping dream or being under drugs. So, if you consider such deep modification of reality as modifying the basic qualia (and not just changing the physical laws), as a different “universe”, yes, it is possible. In sort, if we consider the universe as some kind of qualia flow, we can construe another flow with different logic. Yet we cannot construe a universe with different logic by just modifying the laws of physics. You should also note that this will require changing not only sensory qualia such as vision, but more subtle ones, involving thinking and memory. 

Random is by definition the lack of predictability. So if it is possible to predict an event, it cannot be random. The inverse question would then be: Are there some things that man cannot predict? Answering that question would indirectly answer your question as well. So is a dice roll random? Well, lets see: Lets assume that you have the equipment to measure the exact starting conditions. Assume also that you have a supercomputer that can simulate the dice bouncing around on the table. Would the dice roll be random? It would seem, no, because the dice result can be calculated from its starting conditions. But lets question the assumption. Due to Heisenbergs uncertainty principle, it is impossible to measure the exact starting conditions (the starting conditions are affected by the very act of measuring them. The more accurate you try to measure, the greater you affect the very accuracy you are trying to achieve). And if the system you're going to simulate is chaotic (versus linear) $URL$ then any error in measuring will cause deviations in the simulation that grows exponentially in magnitude, causing very different results. Since even the most accurate measurement technology wouldn't be able to account for this exponential deviation growth and inability to measure extreme accuracy, you could say that it actually is possible to generate randomness. But lets question that result even more. The randomness is based on the fact that there is a limit to how far into the future we can predict about a given chaotic system (the limit depending on how chaotic the system is). So that means that if we only try to predict within the timelimit, we can actually make moderate predictions about the result. Once we move beyond the limit, our predictions will be so off course that they become unusable. Ok, so where are we now? In order to generate an unpredictable event, we need a system with the following properties: 

Although I'm a linguist, I'm going to not give a report on the sociology of the term as used in the field (though the quick answer is "yes"). Instead, I will focus on the basic conceptual distinctions. The term "language" refers to the numerous methods of encoding propositions and communicating, which humans use -- examples are Greek, English, Swahili, Chinese. However, in the modern era, the concept has been extended metaphorically so that we now hear about "the language of dance" or "the language of bees", and in the aforementioned instance, "the language of computers". It is not clear what "language" refers to in the modern extended sense -- it seems to refer to any regular pattern, and DNA encoding can be seen to be a "kind of language". The term "natural language" then is used to specifically identify "language" in the classical sense. However, we rarely use that expression, since we consider the extension of the term "language" to other forms of animal behavior, or complex physical systems like DNA, to be misuse of the term "language". Since the term "language" clearly refers to human language, we don't need to add any modifiers. But it may be necessary when in a popular forum. (It has also become necessary in computational linguistics, in the field "natural language programming", precisely because "programming language" is a standard term in that field). That said, one of the top journals in the field is in fact named Natural Language and Linguistic Theory. 

Yes, you correctly pointed to the research by Breuer. In short, his result shows that it is mathematically impossible to predict own future, even if otherwise the universe is deterministic. Whatever you do to predict the future of a system where you are contained, your calculations will give a wrong result. 

It should be noted that there is a chance that can save the free will. A research by Thomas Breuser concluded that neither deterministic, nor indeterministic universally-valid theories are possible. That means that no theory can predict (even probabilistically) the future of a system which contains the observer himself due to self-reference problem. As such it seems that the free will of at least the observer can be saved while all other people will appear to him as following the laws of deterministic or random theory and as such, not possessing free will. Particularly, regarding quantum mechanics Breuer proves that a system which includes the observer has states in phase space which are in principle cannot be distinguished by observer himself however good measurement devices he would employ. Yes these states affect the future evolution of the system. This can be understood as that there is hidden information which real but unreadable by any physical device which affects the future behavior of the observer.
