This free's us of the burden of elaborate physical security. The only physical security we need is enough to keep normal people from figuring out what's going on and becoming a leak. Thus a network of safe houses to provide a non-descript place to work is our best defense. A bonus would be a combination safe that no one person knows the full combination to, would be a useful way to slow them down, provided it doesn't slow us down. So maybe it's just a prop. Misinformation can also be employed. Any of the ideas in the other answers would be a fine elaborate distraction that works even if the package isn't really there. We don't want the ninjas to even know our protection strategy.

Presuming that the audience/readers are native English speakers I see no reason not to subvert English idioms. Subverting an idiom your audience has never heard of sounds pointlessly confusing. I think a simple mashup of the two gives an obvious meaning, makes it distinct, and reminds one that the speaker comes from a different perspective: What in Earth? 

Since we can color change already to display advertisements turn white when under attack then black to cool down faster. 

I presume this is a "Hollywood" weapon, meaning the most important thing is to look cool, not to be effective. Otherwise, I'd point out that piecing has been known to be the most effective way to use a sword since before roman times. So no, you don't have to even have slicing in your combat style, quad or not. Why quad then? You could explain away this design by claiming it's a "ceremonial" weapon. 

Sure why not? All you need for intelligence is communication pathways and signal discrimination. That's a computer science AI perspective though. From a evolutionary biology point of view the question is, why does a fungus have hard intellectual problems to solve? It wouldn't bother getting smart unless it needed to. If you want to satisfy the biologists the fungus needs to benefit from this calorie consuming intelligence in some way. 

I would actually not take video games as a reference, especially not ones focusing on action. Historically spears started out as mainly single handed weapons but in a much shorter fashion probably somewhere in Africa. As different cultures evolved them to be longer for the advantage of greater distance especially agains cavalry they also became harder to handle. For the right balance and accurate control infantry started using them with both hands. The single hand usability actually differs from the weapons length and balance. Greek hoplite used a long spear single handedly in combination with a shield as seen in the movie Troy. For a compromise between balance and protection their shields had an indentation to rest the spear on, basically as a weaker second hand to lower the negative effects of the single hand use but it was probably still less easily controllable. I honestly do think the use of a long dual hand spear as a single hand weapon is anything but beneficial. Even the advantage of close distance combat with a dagger or short sword would probably not outweigh the loss of control of your main weapon. With the right shield that lowers the negative effects like explained earlier it can work but other than that, I'd rather take distance from such an approach. 

It only causes harm to the human body if the body is part of a closed circuit, otherwise electricity won't even move through the body. The effects on your body depend on whether it's AC or DC traversing through. The former causes the heart to try to adapt to the oscillation and a frequency of 50Hz may already cause ventricular fibrillation or even cardiac arrest with an increasing chance on higher frequencies. Also it can cause paralyzation on your muscles if the electricity is high enough. The latter may cause electrolysis in your body, which results in a sepsis that causes your death few days later. The mentioned effects both depend on the amount of electricity as well as the impact duration with both values rising the chance on increase. 50V AC and 120V DC are said to be perilous to the human body. Both types of electricity cause burns on your skin and your flesh. The shorter the distance the electricity covers through the body the smaller the resistance and thus the smaller the voltage. As your legs are usually the exit point to the ground hits on your legs are less violative than hits on your arms. It gets worse when your heart or brain are within the path. The resistance is composed of the resistance of your body and the transition resistances of the entry and exit point. Dry skin has a higher resistance so seemingly unintuitive being wet and sweaty reduces the voltage and thus the damage to the body. Defending a river might be a much more desirable point of defence. Just shoot in the water when the enemy tries to cross it. Bullets lose acceleration very quickly in water so they become quite harmless. Electricity does have a very high drop-off ratio in water (which is why a lightning hitting a lake doesn't kill all its fish) but on close distance it would be devastating. 

If earth suddenly lost friction we'd all die in massive earthquakes and tsunamis as all the pent up tectonic energy everywhere is released at once. But after that we'd never have an earthquake again since now the plates are perfectly lubed. Not that we'd be around to care. Don't worry, the mud slides will give us a proper burial. 

It would finally make wind and solar a dominate source of power. One of the biggest things limiting wind and solar is they don't produce power when we need power the most. The advantage oil, coal, nuclear, and geo thermal have is they produce power on demand. Wind and solar produce when they feel like it. This means we can't use them exclusively. We use them to supplement to reduce our need on other sources when they do produce but that's all. Room temperature super conductivity would let us build stable efficient batteries. That would let us store energy and release it on demand. Sure you could also give ball bearings a run for their money but the power thing seems like the big thing. 

I think you just invented the most fun physics toy of all time. What you are abusing is Sir Isaac Newton's second law of motion. Force equals mass times acceleration. You could also say: force divided by mass equals acceleration. That means if mass is infinite no amount of force is going to cause a net acceleration. This has fun consequences. For one thing if it's moving when you turn it on it's going to keep moving. If you drop it, even slightly, before turning it on it's going to slowly plow through earths core for no better reason than it's not stoping for nothin no how. See Newton's first law. (And Thor's hammer). If you don't move it before turning it on you can leave it hovering in the air. Gravity is still pulling on it but it isn't gonna budge. If it wasn't for your magic the earth would be moving toward it. It almost sounds like you've suspended the third law. Or maybe you just figured out how to have all the mass you like and not cause any gravity. I know I want one. I'll spin it before turning it on. Perpetual motion! Energy crisis over! 

In higher civilizations low class people had to fulfill physical work often in the outside, thus being in the sun all day tanning their skin. On the contrary high class people often stayed inside their houses doing more management work and a lot of delegating physical work to their subjects, hence the brighter skin due to a lack of exposure to the sun. That's also where the term blue-blooded originates from, the blue veins shimmer through the untanned skin. Personally I thought this philosophy originated in medieval europe but the concept could be easily transferred to earlier civilizations. As far as I know this has been the idea inside europe's civilization as well, which weakens the argument of caucasians conquering and colonizing the world as the main reason. No doubt, though, colonization did play a role in many non-european cultures but as said, later on in history. 

The shortest documented adult ever became only 54.6cm (21.5"). Even though this is quite small, I'd say it is definitely way too large to be able to fly with (butter)fly wings. I could rather imagine bird or bat wings. I also assume you cannot simply gain a human in a form as tiny as one wants to imagine as many of our organs probably have a limited minimum size to function properly. You'd have to change the internal body massively and throw out anything not absolutely necessary. Also they'd probably not as slim but rather have a stocky body and a quite oversized head. Retaining human intelligence with a brain a fraction of the size of ours is hardly possible. They may have a slightly improved efficiency but barely anywhere close to human intelligence. Also a more efficient brain would raise the demand of energy so they'd have to eat and sleep very much. In addition to the high energy demand for their flying ability I'd say that's a very limiting factor. As for your last question, that's a matter of supply and demand. Since human teeth are like ivory to them they create jewelry from, less people believing in fairies mean less teeth and thus higher value per tooth. The much more important question is: why would such a creature develop? Did they develop out of a hominid or an insect, and why would it shrink and develop full wings but not change anything else (or vice versa, why would it change its body into the human form)? The human body has specialized to living on the ground and it's obviously totally ineffective and useless if it was able to fly. 

It might be possible. But you have to think outside a few boxes. For one thing. What makes a sun your sun? Do you HAVE to orbit it? We already do exactly this with Polaris. We just don't think of Polaris as our sun. Polaris doesn't exactly keep us warm. But why shouldn't it? Because it's fairly long way away. Any way to fix that? 

I don't think this would devastate or invalidate the scientific method. It may well keep it from becoming popular. We live in a semi non-deterministic world now. But there is a clear distinction between the deterministic parts and non-deterministic parts. We expect a rock to be a rock. But we expect people to be moody. In a world like you describe, physics may have less to do with Newton's laws and more to do with Sigmund Freud's. If you want a rock to be a rock you may first have to spend some time listening to it talk about the day it's had. So science wouldn't be dead. But it would sure be different. If this god keeps screwing around eventually he'll get caught and a theory about him will be born. You're describing a case where he's leaving indirect evidence behind. Sometimes that's enough. We make have discovered a new 9th planet just by looking at how the orbits of other objects have been arranged.

Things you can do when you're absolutely certain about the future: Buy insurance. With enough money and a narrow enough definition you can get pretty good odds. Start a cult. You don't care about seeming nuts. You care about getting people to do things. Be careful to tease apart what you know and what you assume. UFO's, saucers, and humanoid aliens walking about are all that have been foretold. Not our extinction. It may be that what you really need to do is prevent earth becoming a tourist trap. 

It's still a sharp pointy stick. I wouldn't buy one but if you came at me with one I would definitely start paying attention.
