You have three companies who want you, you currently owe them nothing, reject the one that does not cater to your best interest and move on. Good luck 

Three days ago I was called by a company recruiter. I had applied at many jobs and did not know specifically which company was calling me and for which task. He first asked if I was still looking for a job, and then asked what my price range was. I just said 18 dollars an hour. He asked me what the least was, and I said 15 if it's easy. He said ok and claimed he would be contacting me soon. This morning, he emailed me claiming that he would be passing my resume to his supervisor (good). In that email, he included a link to the current job description. After reading the job description, it is apparent that I will need at least 20 per hour, based on the difficulty of the tasks presented in the job description. Should I wait until they respond and initiate the hiring process, and then re-elaborate on the salary? Something like "After viewing the job duties, I will need at least 20 per hour." What's your recommended plan of attack? Thank you for your advice. 

There will be no legal issues for cancelling Politely explain that you found a better opportunity and are no longer available for the position, this can be done over the phone. 

Make a conscious effort to become sincere and more sociable with people in your everyday life. It's difficult but its something we must learn to do if we wish to grow. I bombed a crucial interview the other day for this very reason. Practice with friends, when u go out for gas, at every available opportunity. 

I think talking to him up front as friends would be the best. Explain to him that you would never steal from anyone and reassure him that he must be mistaken, and that something else must have happened to the money that he has possibly overlooked, or even misplaced it. Assure him that you understand him, but that he is mistaken. This is much better than simply denying it. Maintain eye contact when your are telling him this, so that he knows that you have integrity and are being honest. He should believe you after that 

It may be appropriate. I certainly don't think it is inappropriate. If it is important to you and you have a compelling reason to do so, go ahead. Personally, if I was the one receiving the letter, I would find that strange. If you are seeking a position in any company (University or any other businesses) you are dropping your personal brand and assuming that company's brand. You are making a proposal to put your skills to their service under their flag, under their brand. I would use that logo if I were to look for a position as a free-lancer professional, or if I were seeking a position in design (in which case it would be a logo I would have designed for myself). The most important thing is: ask yourself what you would think if you were in the position of the recipient of that letter. Ask yourself what is the compelling reason to adding your logo - what is it that you are trying to achieve. If you cannot find an actual (professional) reason for it (that would add more value to your worth for that position), there is your answer. 

If you are faced with a situation where you would need to interview someone you know - either someone you like or someone you dislike, it doesn't really matter - you will have a bias towards that person, either positive or negative. And that alone is unprofessional. If a friend, relative, spouse, ..., of yours is to be considered for a position in your company - would you favor them in detriment of other professionals? That wouldn't be professional... it is okay to refer someone to your company, but you need to disclose that information. And you shouldn't be the one doing an interview. The same applies for someone you dislike for personal reasons. You should disclose the fact that you know them, mention you do have a bias towards them for personal reasons. Should management ask for additional information, please, share the aspects you feel comfortable sharing, but keeping in mind you need to keep the hiring process fair to the candidate, to yourself and to your company - every story has two sides to it, and if you are the only one sharing your point of view - you may influence the hiring process in an unfair way. For fairness and professionalism's sake you should mention to management you wouldn't feel comfortable doing the interview and excuse yourself from the process. Let them assign someone else to the interview if they still want to consider that person. It will be professional and a strong enough message on your ethics. It will at the same time make them pay close attention to everyone in the hiring process to make sure they are a good fit to company culture and won't bring more trouble than benefit for your company, keeping it fair and a healthy workplace for everyone. 

I think reasons/explanations are more important. A cover letter and interview can do a much better job in this case than just a chronological CV. Someone who got out of the workforce to raise a child until they were school age is not such a bad thing. However, you may need to show you've made some effort to keep your skills up to date. That really depends on what type of work you do. 

This can be seen as: genius, simple-minded, or smart-ass. Personally, I'd rather hire people who are capable of doing complex things and work with them to tone it down than people who do not have the mental horse-power and some how make them smarter. EDIT: Usually in interview coding questions, it's not expected to write out code that fully compiles, have complete unit test coverage, handles errors, validates user input, is overly efficient, scales, looks eloquent, beautiful, etc. You can always ask. A good interviewer would let you know what is expected. EDIT 2: Maybe we should stop asking programming questions during interviews and just look at the candidate's Github postings. 

It's an advantage because you're more likely to say no/ask for more. There's no way anyone can tell me they wouldn't think they have an advantage if a company directly came after them. The cost of things in many of the world's economies is supply and demand and hiring isn't immune. Since it is difficult to get hard salary information (You can do a search on local car prices and get better data), perception of need can play a role. This company posted an open job. Most people assume they really want to fill this position and will probably be willing to match the current salary market to a certain degree. It's not like you just sent them a resume for a position that doesn't exist. Their perception of your qualification could be enhanced if they were to reach out to you. Let say: 

You could make your argument against most interruptions and distractions. I might as well have my Facebook popping up if I'm forced to sit next to a sales person on the phone all day. Or people constantly asking me questions to thinks they could be searching for themselves. Are your meetings really that efficient? What tasks have you given an employee that adds nothing to the bottom-line? You are better off focusing your attention on other things to get more out of your employees. Clarify your expectations. If they're not getting work done and claiming they didn't have enough time, you need to work with that person and come up with a strategy. It may require them to spend less time on chat lines. 

On your first question: how can I get more time from company A - I would say - Just ask for it. Be honest. Just say you need a little more time to consider your career choices. The effect? If they really like you, they will probably give you a few days - but they have a business to run, so it will not be a long time. If they just consider you to be an "okay" candidate, they will tell you they can't wait, and pressure you to give them an answer or they will just move on to the next person in line. On your second question: what you should do about companies B, C and D - you need to establish a limit date for each one of them - how many days are you able/willing to wait for each one of those companies to get in touch with you? Start from there, then make your decision. It is a good practice to always reach out to a candidate with an answer - either a positive or negative one - but unfortunately it's not all companies that follow good practices, so you may never hear from them again. Be prepared for that. In case you do get a positive answer from one of them - same thing applies as in question #1: if it wasn't your favorite who made you an offer and you want more time to wait for another company, just ask for it. But always bear in mind that when negotiating there is always a risk the other part will not agree and it may jeopardize your chances with them. It all depends on how much you want - or don't want - to work on each of those companies. Also, if I can add an opinion - you already said you don't want to work for company A. Would you be happy there? Would you be committed? Would you be doing your best? If not, why are you still considering it? Maybe the honest thing to do for yourself and for that company is to just withdraw or decline from the process. And they can move on to find someone who is better suited for the job (in terms of actually wanting it).
