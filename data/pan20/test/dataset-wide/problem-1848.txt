Those last two bullets are for you. Going on course is hard - you have to listen, and learn, and these days you still get emails that you have to deal with at lunch and after hours, and maybe you aren't at your usual location, and so on. So I remind you that this isn't just for me, it's also for you. You know something your boss doesn't know - those last two bullets mean nothing to you. If you tell your boss this, the first bullet doesn't go away. The decision has already been made that spending the money on the training is worth it to the company because of the first bullet. Most firms allot little or no benefit to the other two, except in a vague "employee satisfaction and retention" way. Sometimes people would request courses like "assertive communication" or whatnot and I would agree simply for last-two-bullet reasons, but that was the exception. Your boss has justified the cost of the course and your time for first-bullet reasons. So what are your choices? 

The good news is, it doesn't matter which of these are true - you just don't want to continue applying for this job. You don't want to work for the place whose web site was glued together from samples provided by applicants of varying quality, or who doesn't mind exploiting vulnerable or desperate people, you don't want to work with a company that cannot explain its needs to you, and you won't get to work at the place where you need to be much faster or better than you are now. So thank them and decline to go further into the process. 

This advice was very popular two decades ago with sales letters. You were supposed to send paper letters to strangers like this: 

When I fire someone, or lay someone off, I make a decision about what to tell the rest of the staff. With a firing, sometimes I am very open about the performance problems the person had and the steps I took to work on them with the employee - especially where others were aware the employee was struggling; other times I say less on the matter. With a layoff I am always clear on where the company stands but I may not go into details about who was chosen beyond "it was based on the skills mix the company needs going forward." I have enough experience to know that coworkers are going to be curious, and a little worried for themselves, so we would often have a short meeting that was focused on that aspect of this - how does this affect the remaining workers? I can tell you this - if I've decided not to discuss why I fired someone, being asked why I fired someone would change nothing. Asking almost implies that I hadn't considered the possibility others are curious or worried, and of course I have considered it. As a result I would be a little offended. If you're young as well as a new hire, I would chalk it up to inexperience. If you're experienced enough to know better, it would lower my opinion of you that you're pressing for details on a decision of mine either out of personal curiosity or perhaps because you think I made a bad decision. I recommend you ask questions about yourself not about the people who have left. Are there layoffs underway and are you at risk? Will you be picking up new duties to cover some of what the terminated people used to do? Is the focus of the company or department or team changing? Are the standards of good performance changing (perhaps because of a new manager) meaning you should adjust your behaviour? (Typically that gets announced, but you can ask if you like.) Questions about yourself are not as invasive or curiosity-based as questions about another person. 

They need to know why you need an answer and when, and you need to give them an action item. That would be true of emails too but it's all the more true with such a constrained communication device as a post-it. If you really need an answer, I would risk being rude. Later if the person says it was rude, you can ask what would be better - not angrily, like "what the heck do you expect me to do?" but patiently, like "how can I let you know when I really need you during a busy day?" As an alternative to leaving a note, consider sending a meeting request. I blogged about someone else's blog about makers schedule and manager's schedule, and I think it's relevant here. 

Your supervisor did something that is a fireable offence and you think you shouldn't have told anyone when you were in a meeting for that purpose and now you're wondering how to apologize to your supervisor? Long ago, one of my children cheated on a quiz at school and came and told me. I told her to tell the teacher what she had done, but she didn't want to because then the other girl would get in trouble. (It was a "pass your papers to the left and the other can mark them" quiz: by prior arrangement she left some blank and the other girl filled in correct answers for her as the teacher called them out, thus confessing would uniquely identify the other culprit.) I told her, and I'm telling you: 

This is your story. You already know it. Don't use my example answers, use yours, but first take the time to really know what they are. Why did you take that job? Why did you leave it for the job you took next? You don't need to figure out how to dress it up or cover it up for an interview. You just need to figure out how to tell all of it, including how you're different now. It can be a great way to show that you're a creative problem solver, to remind them of your skills (either from that job or the ones that follow), and what's important to you. Embrace it! 

And make a note to yourself about this employer so that you can evaluate whether you want to work for them. 

Tell Bob that, like him, you do not mix work with personal life. Tell him you cannot have anything "on a personal level" with him. Don't be rude, but don't be all "oooh I wish I could date you if it wasn't for the fact you're a client" either. Don't give an opinion either way on dating Bob or how much he does or does not appeal to you or the extent to which you are free or interested. Just make it clear that anything on a personal level is not going to be possible. Close by hoping that you can continue to meet professionally so that you can [whatever the USP is for your product eg "make your developers more productive" or "save you money on electricity"] in the future. He's made it quite clear and isn't hinting and trying to make you "read between the lines", and nor is he trying to set up sales meetings as a way to get dates, so he should be fine with what you're saying. If he cancels all your sales meetings, I suppose you could ask your boss to try with another rep, but potential deals come and go and I wouldn't make a big fuss about what made this one go. It's possible there wouldn't have even been a second lunch if he hadn't wanted a personal relationship, meaning that you declining that opportunity has not cost your firm a sale, since there never really was a sale to be made. 

That last one might have cost you the job. I can accept a certain amount of lecturing about how to interview properly and put it down to nerves and the usual complaints about "kids these days" and how the millenials are ruining the world etc (that's sarcasm btw) but if you don't end up answering something then you've blown it. How should you have handled it? Probably something like this. I'll use italics for what you're thinking, and regular type for what you say out loud. 

Now to you it's obvious that those are all terrible things to do. But your boss wanted them done. Don't assume your boss is an idiot. There may be tremendous first-mover advantage or some other reason behind these requests. Say there's a 50-50 chance the app will crash and your ratings will go down if you release without testing. Maybe your boss believes there's a 100% chance your ratings will go down if another week goes by that the competition has feature X and you don't. So your boss decides to take the chance since there's actually nothing to lose. (And of course, there's even less to lose if the boss knows Korcholis will come in on the weekend and make everything ok again, right?) So understand what motivated the boss to ask you to do these crazy things. Help your boss understand why you weren't surprised it crashed. Talk openly about avoiding overtime, weekend emergencies, and so on. Reach a point where you know why these pressures and demands are coming to you, and where you boss knows why you push back on some of them. And next time the boss asks for a late Friday deploy, you can include a warning in your push back: I'm not available at all this weekend, from 5pm when I leave here until Monday morning when I wake up. (Don't say why.) I may not be able to even answer my phone, but if I do, I won't be able to talk long or come into the office. Let's not take the chance you might need me over that time. Surely it's wiser to wait until Monday morning? The decisions are not yours to make; that is the role your boss is here to fill. You can provide the relevant information and you can control your own free time. 

In addition to the tell-em-tell-em-tell-em patter, this uses First, Second, Third, Fourth to help both you and your colleague keep your place in the list, and it includes a question (one with a summary hidden in it) to provide a place for more meaningful feedback than head-nodding. This sort of structure should make things easier to follow. 

Taking the time to write that out will be good for you. Even if you don't put it in your resume, you can use it when deciding to apply, you can use it when people say "why do you want to work here", you can use it when people say "tell me a little about yourself" and it will generally be very good for you to know what you want and be able to say it succinctly. Just don't say something cliche ridden that would apply to anyone. Make it real, make it about you and what you genuinely want. That can be scary, but in the long run it's good. 

You have spotted such a person. You despise him. You think his assumptions and decisions are all wrong. You couldn't stand to work under him. You worry that your own manager will be blinded by friendship and promote this person. Let's say for a moment that is what will happen unless you step in. What will stepping in do for you? Will it prevent the promotion? That seems unlikely - you're convinced that the powers-that-be value personal friendship above all else. So all that will happen is that word of your attempt to stop this will reach your new boss. If ever there was a way to make things worse, this would be it. Why not try to see if this person has a single redeeming feature? It's possible that understanding customers, or following regulatory changes, or being well connected to the sales side of the company, are actually good things. What could you do to reduce the chances that this person, as your boss, would make horrible decisions that would ruin the company? Can you provide a strength this person is missing? If so, there's a chance you can work together (and do great things) without being friends. For that to happen you will have to let go of despising and of wanting to warn people about him, and instead let management manage, then do a great job. Knowing the weaknesses of those around you, and helping the team succeed despite those weaknesses, is another form of politics. Perhaps it is one that will work for you. 

That last one is highly unlikely, but I have to consider the possibility you work in an insane company. If in fact raises are mechanically determined based on features or bug fixes in the live code, this conversation gives your boss time to adjust assignments or merge some of your code in or whatever. If, as is far more likely, things just aren't that cut and dried (after all, this is a place that paid you to write some great stuff and then left it lying around because there wasn't time to integrate it - I find it unlikely they have the tools to let someone who isn't your boss determine who wrote what and hand out raises accordingly) then you will get your reassurance. If this chat takes less than 15 minutes, you could also offer: 

Don't specifically ask your employer to punish, terminate, and/or transfer anyone. But do approach your manager, or if that's Jane, the manager above you both, and say what has happened. Focus on how it made you feel, not what you think should be done. For example 

So, first of all, look at your email. A good one starts with a single sentence that summarizes everything: 

Some internships either don't pay at all or pay far too little. There will always be candidates who can afford this. For example, their parents may be funding them, so that they don't need to pay their own rent and food, nor save for the next year's schooling. Further, there will always be candidates who can't afford it, because they need to meet their expenses from their income. Companies know that they are drawing from a smaller pool of candidates when they offer little or no pay. Famous companies that look good on your resume, or that might hire you after you perform well on an internship, can get away with this: enough good candidates will want to be there that the jobs will be filled with good interns. You see this in yourself: you really want to be there despite the atrocious salary. I don't happen to feel these things are fair. A big multinational company should be able to pay everyone a living wage and not demand subsidies from those just starting out. Yet I supported one of my children who got a work term job 10,000 miles from home that would pay only enough to eat, and provided him a university residence room to live in. He was unable to save for the next school term, and needed cash top-ups from us to fund explorations and excursions in the far-away country. We did it because we felt it was terrific experience for him. The company wasn't exploitive, because the salary was in fact more than locals would have been paid for the work. I am sure you can imagine there are some parents who would support a child of theirs to enable them to take an internship with a prestigious company like the one you're considering. I expect there is nothing you can do to raise the salary for this internship to a level that would support you without a family subsidy. If you have no way to make up the shortfall for 4-6 months, you probably just can't take this internship.
