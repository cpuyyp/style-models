For most goods, we can compare the value of them by how people trade them. If in a free market, 10 apples can be traded for 20 oranges, then apples are twice as valuable as oranges. Likewise, if 10 apples can be traded for \$1, and 20 oranges can be traded for \$1, the same thing holds. When I lend or borrow money, I am essentially buying or selling future money. If Alice lends Bob \$10 for 10 years with \$1 interest, then Bob is essentially selling Alice \$11 future dollars for a price of \$10 today. Additionally, if Bob buys \$10 of future corn today, and then corn is \$11 in the future, that means \$10 of todays money is worth \$10 of future money (on average since future corn today may be evaluated differently then future corn in the future, just due to unknown information. The free market is pretty smart in the long run though.) Can this be used to track the changing value of money then, such as inflation and deflation? (I guess its hard to use this, since both interest rates and the money supply are simultaneously manipulated by government backed institutions.) 

The government introduces USD 2.0 (I'll use & as the currency symbol). They will exchange \$1 for &1 both ways. They slowly encourage USD 2.0 (tax cuts, make the banks do it, tax USD 1.0 more, contracts need to be specified in &1, etc...) Now, although they will give &1 for \$1, they stop giving \$1 for &1. They buy \$1 and sell &1. a. Central banks can convert their money from USD to USD 2.0. Now getting this part right is important. At the same time as part 3, certain kinds of debt (specified by the government) may be converted to USD 2.0. Consumer Debt, such as mortgages and credit cards, are converted. So are intergovernmental loans. Loans from the U.S. government to foreign countries may not converted, and stay in USD 1.0. a. The above list is not exhaustive. A list of types of debts and set of rules for the conversion will have to be established. b. At this point, foreign countries will start to get nervous, and will try to sell their loans. Since it is already apparent that USD is going under, and these loans can't be converted to USD 2.0, they likely will not get face value, even in USD cash (since that can be converted to USD 2.0). They certainly won't be able to liquidate all of it, simply because there isn't enough USD cash for it to be liquidated. c. It is very important that you, in allowing certain types of debt to be converted to USD 2.0, don't accidently allow a pathway for foreign loans to directly or indirectly be converted to USD 2.0. Now, the Federal government stops trading USD for USD 2.0 at all. The U.S. economy should be shifted entirely to USD 2.0 at this point. Now, you can simply print of 6.2 trillion USD 1.0, pay the debts, and be fine. USD 1.0 will become worthless, but USD 2.0, what the economy is based on, will be fine. 

On the other hand, it could be argued that the size of R&S activity is not intrinsically increasing: for example, regarding point 2 above, it can be argued that as new industries replace old ones, so too do new R&S roles replace old roles. Given I believe the R&S sector can only grow in relative size over the long term, I am logically interested in understanding how this sector influences the economy and how an economy evolves as a consequence of the increasing importance of regulation and supervision. For example, it might be the case that an outsized R&S sector has similar negative effects to those due to the proliferation of rent-seeking activities. 

As economies become more complex and sophisticated, certain systemic risks gradually emerge and R&S jobs are needed to monitor and control these risks (e.g. the development of the banking systems in Western countries has generated the risk of systemic financial instability, as seen in the numerous banking crisis throughout the last centuries); Growth often comes through innovation, which brings disruption through the formation of new sectors of activity which tend to replace or substitute old ones. As these new sectors grow and become more mature, the limitations and risks they pose become gradually apparent to society which will ultimately demand to regulate and supervise them either through private or public action (e.g. the current debate around the use of personal data by social networks and the need to regulate it); Rogue economic actors can exploit institutional loopholes or lack of oversight to perform illegal or borderline illegal activities for their profit. Once society identifies these shortcomings, R&S is improved to avoid repetition of these unfair practices (e.g. the Enron scandal and the resulting Sarbanes-Oxley Act in the US). 

This is not a reasonable assumption. Constant prices would imply that there is government control of prices, in which case none of the usual economic models apply. 

You are overthinking the definitions of inflation and deflation. There is much simpler terminology for this effect: "getting richer" and "getting poorer". I won't repeat the definition of inflation; it appears you understand what it is. But it only refers to the changing nature of prices; it doesn't account for people's ability to afford things. Regarding your assumptions: 

We often hear of countries securing foreign investment. Stores like this are trumped as major achievements. Foreign investment also has criticisms - profits generated in a country end up going abroad, and there can be national security issues. Would it make sense to print money instead? The usual argument against printing money is inflation. However, in the linked story, 30bn of foreign money is coming in, so the economy has to cope with that additional spending. If that was printed money instead, it seems that effect would be the same - at least in the local economy. The other side to this is currency markets and reserves - foreign investment creates demand for the local currency, which printing money doesn't do. 

These seem reasonable. While they won't be constant in a real-world economy, making these kind of simplifications to build a model is completely reasonable. Bear in mind that you've not specified constant resources. So if someone finds a diamond, they get richer. There's still a constant amount of money, but they are better off. 

Stocks are not money. The valuation of a company - the market captialisation - is the number of shares multiplied by the share price. The share price is the price people are willing to trade at right now. It does NOT mean all the shares have been traded at that price. If a company issues 1 million shares, at a starting price of £10, the market cap is £10 million. They may only sell a few of these shares, so much less than £10 million actually changes hands. If the price rises to £20, only a few of the shares changed hands at that price - but the market cap is reflected in all the shares, and is now £20 million. People have commented on the flaws in this methodology. The same happens in a crash. Only a fraction of the shares actually change hands, but the media report on the change in the market cap. If you want an analogy, consider a house burning down. You buy the house for £200,000. Then it sadly burns down (and without insurance). It is now worth £0. However, no money has been created or destroyed; it's a loss of value of an asset.
