Not illegal, but not really a nice thing to do either. You'd want to avoid that as much as possible. Usually the contract won't take effect before you start, if ever, just a day or so before set start date. In your situation, maybe you'd be best to consult another lawyer while yours is out? 

Yes, that is acceptable. During my search for work, I was asked questions regarding knowledge in my field (IT here as well). Usually general things, but still enough to find who was worth looking more into, and those who were... bad... Regarding quiz in general, several people I know have told me that they were quizzed to test knowledge. One that stands out is a guy who applied to a CD\DVD store, he was quizzed about various songs, artists and music genres. As long as the questions are not about race, religion or other personal matters, most questions go as long as they are actually relevant to the job. 

Easy, if your old job is similar to the new one, and maybe even close in a geographical setting, your previous boss and potential new boss MAY know each other. Slim chance, but it's a trap you DON'T want to step in. Besides, you'd want some papers from your old boss, to show your new, and likely they will end up talking on phone regarding you. Lastly, as mentioned, you don't want to seem like the asshole. Not like your new boss can know if your old boss actually was a douche, or it was you who were the douche all along. In short: If you badmouth your previous boss, you only badmouth yourself. 

What I learned about interviews is that you try to sell yourself to the company. To hire someone is a huge risk, as it's not just your paycheck that is a cost attached to you, but also thing like equipment, traveling (if the jobs requires that), training and all that. If they hire the wrong person, they can end up paying for someone who either does not know what they are doing, or simply don't do anything at all. As mentioned, it is an advantage for you, provided you use it. If they reveal something about what they do or need, and you fit it, shoot that info in. "Yes, I can do that! I can fill that role!". But also prove you actually can. If you claim to be good with computers, but actually just know how to surf facebook, you are worth nothing. But, if you say you do your own maintenance, have knowledge regarding many common software solutions and so on, you are suddenly at a greater state. Of course, do not lie or push the boundaries. Be careful tho, it could be a trick. If you just sit there and barely say anything, it might just show them that you are nothing but a bobhead figure that just want to get things over with. Those who hold the interview are the costumers, you are the salesman, trying to convince them why YOUR wares are the best ones. 

Depending on where you are located, you can, by law, deny any picture that includes you be kept away or taken down from the net. Exception is images that are pure crowd (think football stadium) where you happen to be visible + some others, but generally public crowd scenarios. Now, pointing at the law will likely make you look like a "tinfoil hat" person, and at the same time dent your group relationship. A simple way is to decline from being part of the picture, but offer yourself to be the one taking the picture. You can further add that they can add your name to the people present at the event (a name is quite meaningless without a face in therms of photos). I see your reasoning, not wishing to have your information spread across the galaxy, but I can assure you, if you are already not using sites like facebook and google+, or any other site where you "need" to add personal information, it's highly unlikely that your information will even be usable for any big company. A simple name connected to a job without any details beyond that, is useless, it tells nothing about who and\or what you are. Companies are usually more interested in your information for add revenue anyway. If they have no idea about your interests, location nor personal detail, you are useless to them. So if no such information is out there, you should be quite safe. 

I have only ever had one interviewer make a fuss about my breaks between jobs. I told her the truth, which I thought were valid enough reasons. I had a 3 month gap between my last job in the pharmaceutical industry and my next job in an administrative role. Although the culture of the industry I'd left was not for me, it did pay very very well. I worked odd shifts and a lot of overtime while employed, I'd never taken a "gap year" or even a summer off as I did a co-op program in college, so I decided to take a summer off to travel around the US now that I finally had some time. I then worked at an administrative job at a market research firm for almost a year, until my position was downsized. At that time, my mother was starting to fall ill, I'd barely seen much of my family since high school, so I, now 32, decided to move into the apartment above my parent's garage. I had several motivations, but reconnecting with my parents who were aging was the foremost reason. I also needed a change of scenery, job prospects where I'd been living were sparse, and I wanted to take some time to think about what I'd like to study in graduate school. So I did all that, while working part-time at a menial job. Now that I've been out of grad school for two years and have started a new career that I actually enjoy, it has become easy to gloss over that gap and not raise eyebrows, but it was very difficult to explain at first. I never wanted to say too much too personal in interviews, but leaving any of it out made it sound suspicious or like I was lazy. Looking back, that one interviewer who focused more on my gap time that employed time was kind of a jerk. I interview and hire people now and I look at their most recent few positions, the duration spent there, their education, and maybe certifications or achievements. I judge personality, how they will fit within the team. If they can pass our background check, they passed. I do not play detective and cut people who's online profile shows that they drank on spring break in 2002. Any recruiter who does that needs to get a life. I do not analyze gap time, after all time off for a family matter before they worked for me is none of my business. All life experience is "work" whether one is earning a check or not. 

As an interviewer, do not assume the person will go back to the old career. Also do not offer the person a job in the old career if you see they applied to the new career and have completed a 2nd college degree to attain the new career goal. Some interviewers really can not get past the differences. I got that a lot when attempting to switch from being a lab technician to an HR Manager. Aside from not using lab equipment anymore the jobs are NOT that different. There is still a lot of documentation. I still have to work within my team and with other teams. I interview people now, well guess what? I used to interview the new technicians. I still do training. There are some different responsibilities but really the only huge difference is no more having to stand all day or do shift work. Now I actually get to make decisions. When I was first trying to break into the new career, interviewers treated me like I was trying to do something impossible. How could a science person understand HR? I was even hired for a job and then the company changed my role to my old career within a few weeks of hiring me as a bait and switch. I told them I did not complete 3 more years of school to go back to working weird hours in a manufacturing plant and promptly quit when they would not change me back to what I was hired for. 

Textbook answers are common, but everyone knows them, and thus it can lead to sneaky questions trying to peel the exact reason why you left to begin with. The cards you can play here heavily depend on what you carry to begin with. If you need to move house, and the new job is closer\more available, that's a start. Got kids? Maybe the area has better schools. See where I am going here? Just don't lie. 

Working within IT, where sub departments work with different tasks, I can relate to this completely, and the answer I've got for you is this: Be honest, and provide all the information you can. There is no real way to avoid pissing of some people, there will always be those who just won't accept any answer not equal to what they wanted, and there is always those who try to play you by making you feel guilty or stupid. As long as you keep your cool and provide all the information you can in an honest way, you are doing your part. There is no shame sending them to other people you think can answer a subject better, that's how work synergy should be. Your job is primarily to send them in the right direction, a little detour here and there is bound to happen at times, so never feel bad for that. 

Might differ depending on country/state, but everything created for your company, or while at work, is usually (by law even) the property of your company. As an example, if you work for Microsoft, and come up with some brilliant idea to "revolutionize" how windows operates, you do not own the idea, Microsoft does. The recognition comes internally, either by colleagues or even your boss patting you on the back (preferably both, I guess). There is a positive side to doing it this way anyway. The boss and company has the responsibility to handle the products and decide if ideas are good or not. If they find an idea to be good, but that same idea ends up being hated by consumers, it's the boss\company that take the hit, not the individual who came up with the idea to begin with. 

You must remember that you will always be you. You can try to change your views, but to drastically and you may end up just hurting yourself. Unless you are designated to be in control of a department, it's not your job to keep it "clean". Just avoid trouble and you usually end up fine. Sacrifices meant to better your career is a double edged sword. You need to make sacrifices to succeed, the question is what you want to sacrifice, and if you do the right ones. 

In short, any reference is (usually) a good reference. I've never really heard about a company writing a negative reference, instead of writing none at all. The only exception, as mentioned, is any reference where family (or friends) is involved in a significant way, such as working at your fathers workshop, or in your mothers flower shop. A reference is more to show who you are, so if you've been on time, tidy, kind to customers, respecting coworkers and been actively taking part in various tasks, you're already in a good position. General knowledge about what you work with will usually be expected, but it's rare to just enter a work space and instantly mastering its rules. Something that is perfectly accepted one place, might be frowned upon somewhere else. So yes, use your references, it's better than going blank. In the end, the worst thing that can happen is to get a 'no', and it's not uncommon knowledge that one will have to work for that one 'yes'. 

I would go with 'No'. The reason is simple. If you get a quick yes, you pretty much have to mention about your location to arrange when you are to start anyway. Depending on the job you apply for, some might want you in-house ASAP, and then you're in a slight amount of trouble. You are also expected to be honest on your resume, and while leaving details out isn't lying per se, it can still be seen as a negative thing. Your papers can be filled with details about experience and recommendations, but your papers matter little until they've actually had you in for an interview, face to face. And don't bother with adding linkedin, blog links or website links, they are not too likely to check it out, as judgement usually falls during interview. The more shiny you seem to be, the more likely they will try and test to see if you actually are that good, or just a punk who has blown his papers way out of proportions. In short, add it. The worst that can happen is you'll get a 'No' from them. They will rarely say exactly why, either. Getting a few negative answers is just your everyday part of being someone who is looking for a job.
