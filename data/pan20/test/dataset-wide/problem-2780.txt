To express that information, we put an 'X' in the intersection of Recording Artists and Songwriters, and due to the earlier shading there is only one area left where this can be: 

Venn diagrams are a great tool to evaluate Categorical Syllogisms! First, draw the basic Venn diagram involving the three categories: 

To do this, we will shade out the area that is inside the Recording Artists, but outside Musicians: that will force any recording artists to indeed be a musician: 

almost seems to be asking: Jesus said killing is wrong ... but what does 'Philosophy' say? The problem with this is that philosophy is not a set of beliefs, but the pursuit of knowledge and truth. So, just because one is a 'philosopher' does not imply that one beliefs one thing or another. Rather, it means that one thinks very carefully about the issue, and tries to come up with reasons and arguments why some claim may be better than others, that's all. Indeed, I similarly cringe when I hear: "Scientists say/science says ...". Yes, I understand there is a highly well-confirmed 'body of knowledge' that forms a big part of what we refer to as 'science', and yet, ultimately, science is the method and the process by which we obtain that body of knowledge, and not the body of knowledge itself. And of course that 'body of knowledge' is organic: theories get modified, and sometimes completely rejected or replaced. But it would be silly to then say "Aha, science was wrong!" ... when in fact it was of course science itself that showed certain theories to be wrong. Using "Philosophy" or "Science" as a stand-in for "what this group of people believes" leads to hasty and sweeping generalizations, straw man fallacies, appeals to authority and intimidation, ad hominems, and silly 'stand-offs' like "science vs religion". In the end it should of course just be about the arguments and the evidence, not whatever label we slap onto things. 

I would classify this as a perfectionist fallacy, which is a variety of the false dilemma: Either you do things perfectly/completely, or else there is no point to doing any of it. Now, for some things, a be-perfect-or-don't-do-it-at-all dilemma actually makes sense: building nuclear power plants comes to mind: yes, either you build then perfectly, or else it's probably a good idea not to build it at all. But, when it comes to helping other people, doing something is still better than doing everything in your power. So, in those cases, the dilemma is a false dilemma. 

It is not a random sample: instead of randomly picking two cases, the speaker carefully chose two that would support their view. The speaker may well construct the memory of their experience in a way to align it with the view they wish to express ... and thus come to believe. For example, the burmese pythons the speaker is familiar with may not have done anything that hurt the speaker, but that is not the same as being 'sweethearts'. Personal experience is always subject to those kinds of constructive interpretations and 'polishing', whereas this is indeed much harder to do with data from Pew research. 

Yes, if the mother says that the kitchen is for eating only, then the child has broken the 'law' when dancing in the kitchen. In general, 'All A are only B' means that all A's can be B's but they cannot be anything that is not a B. As such, notice that this claim is quantifying over predicates; not something you can express using your typical first-order logic statements. Still, if you have a Venn diagram with A, B, and C, then you can indicate that there cannot be any A that is a C but not a B, i.e. the area inside A and inside C but outside B must be empty. 

I've taught Critical Thinking for about 20 years, and I have to agree that there is no good textbook. Let me tell you where I'm coming from: Yes, I've seen all the textbooks with their unending treatments of logic ... Ugh! Sure, logic is important, but why the insistence on formal logic proofs? We have logic courses for that. Indeed, just the fact that the focus is on deductive logic seems rather silly. Most real life reasoning is not deductive and so all this logic has very limited applicability. Yes, logic teaches one to be careful and organized in one's reasoning, but let me put it this way: when it comes to people coming to bad beliefs and making bad arguments, logic is probably the least of our problems. Much more problematic are our cognitive and social biases. When you cover fallacies, you'll find that they can almost all be traced back to those biases, rather than to any logical reasoning impairment. I suppose I should also that say that I define Critical Thinking basically as "thinking about beliefs (especially your own!) and seeing if they make sense". Or: how to not get caught up in bullshit and be an actual truth-seeker! That of course already goes far beyond merely analyzing some prose... it about developing a critical mind-set ... and the many, many psychological and social barriers that exist both inside and outside of us that prevent us from being genuine truth-seekers. So, when I teach Critical Thinking, I spend a few weeks on each of the following: Arguments: basic analysis and evaluation Fallacies: the usual suspects ... though I emphasize rhetorical flim-flam and emotional trickery OK, so far so good, but then: Statistical/inductive reasoning: really important stuff! And by the way: I take a very 'anti-math' approach here as well: you can do all the probability theory and statistics you want, but in the end so many people are still convinced by some hasty generalization of refutation based on one piece of personal experience or anecdotal evidence: that's the kind of crazy thinking that I want my students learn to prevent. Causal reasoning: super important! The way we think the world causally works translates in how we act. And my oh my, are there a great number of pitfalls in causal reasoning! Cognitive biases and social biases: as the great philosopher Clint Eastwood said: "A man's gotta know his limitations". Socrates reportedly mumbled something to that effect as well :) Perception and memory: lots of crappy beliefs come from crappy perception and crappy memory 'Authorities': Media (esp. internet!), culture, science, pseudo-science, religion, etc. Oh, and in case you think I'm all anti-math and don't like logic: I teach Introduction to Logic, Intermediate Logic (meta-logic; soundness, completeness, etc) and Computability and Logic (undecidability of logic, Godel results), and I love it! ... So yes, I could certainly teach a whole critical thinking course all around logic ... it would certainly be a lot easier for me to teach (and assess!) than what I do now ... I just don't think logic has all that much to offer as far as critical thinking goes. So, what book do I use? None. All ingredients can be found on the internet. It's not rocket science. Though I can point to a few books that have provided some valuable material: "How to think about Weird Things" "How we know what isn't so" "How to Lie with Statistics" and there's always Carl Sagan's classic "The Demon-Haunted World" Sorry, all more than 15 years old I'm afraid, but at least they go beyond mere arguments: there is a lot of psychology and sociology behind the formation of our beliefs, and you have to instill awareness of that in the students, or else in my eyes it fails to be a critical thinking course. If there is one key to critical thinking, it's independent thinking! 

Godel's theorems are about mathematics. In fact, his theorems say that we cannot have a recursive (very roughly: 'finite'), complete, and consistent axiomatization (foundation) of basic arithmetic, and thus certainly not one of mathematics as a whole. He thus blew a hole in the hope (see the Hilbert Program) that we could know for sure that 'mathematics', as we typically practice it, is consistent. Indeed, as of today we don't know if the ZF axioms for set-theory, which can be used to underpin a lot of mathematics, are consistent. 

OK, let's just work with the latter. Now, since we're looking for another ∀, we'll do another ∀ Intro: 

My first reaction is that while anything that's dead must have been alive, it's not clear that anything that's alive must die (maybe something can remain alive forever). Thus: death implies life, but life does mot imply death. On the other hand, maybe 'life' would be meaningless without death? That is, if everything would be alive forever, i.e. in the absence of death, would we even have a concept of life? Well, maybe so: rocks aren't alive ... but they're not dead either. That is, even in the absence of death, we can still separate life from non-life. So yes, I stick to my first reaction: death implies life, but life does not imply death. 

I would add to Chelonian's list the view of Idealism, as that seems to be a view the OP is leaning towards, especially with the last claim. Idealism states that consciousness is what constitutes reality, while the material world is really just an abstraction of the patterns in those conscious experiences. That is, when we do science, we quantify the abstract features of our experiences, and what we call the 'physical world' is merely a description of those abstract patterns. 

From a purely logical point of view, that inference makes so little sense that there really is no name for it. However, if you run into a case like this in the real world, i.e. If you see some human agreeing to P, and to If P then Q, but not to Q, there could be several things going on. For one, we could be dealing with a case of willful Ignorance, or willful denial, which isn't not so much a fallacy in the sense of a logical thinking mistake, but rather a result of other cognitive factors not making one accept what should be accepted. Possible reasons are wishful thinking or just being cognitively stuck on a certain idea or belief. Another possibility is that the people don't really believe P, or that they believe that P is probably true, or true in most cases, but that in this particular case P does not hold, preventing the inference to Q. Same for If P then Q: maybe they generally believe that If P then Q, but that there are certain exceptions that apply to this particular case. And let's also note that their refusal to acccept Q is not necessarily the same as rejecting Q. In short, the purely formal logical characterisation of their reasoning might just be too simplistic to capture the nuances that are going on. Indeed, the world is a messy place, so to think that we can make our way around with simple Modus Ponens's is a pipe dream. 

I don't see how it is circular. Let me try and recap the argument (let me know if I missed something): Axiom 7: Anything that can be conceived as non-existing does not have existence as part of its essence Premise 2: God is a substance P7: Existence is part of the essence of a substance Conclusion: God exists Couple of comments on that argument: First, it really isn't circular. None of the premises by themselves make the same claim as the conclusion. Of course, the information expressed by the conclusion is contained among the premises as a set, but that is just the very nature of deductive reasoning: by combining premises we can get to the conclusion. Second, I have no idea why you would even use Axiom 7. This is for two reasons. First, the conclusion immediately follows from premise 2 and P7. Second, when the proof by contradiction as you stated it assumes that God exists, and then uses Axiom 7 to conclude that existence is not part of the essence of God, there is a problem in that Axiom 7 talks about our ability to conceive something as not existing, which is really quite different from something actually not existing, so I don't see how that inference is supposed to work, unless you add the further premise that if something does not exist, then we can conceive it not existing. In the end though, this all seems unncessarily difficult, when we can go directly from Premise 2 and P7 to the conclusion: easy peasy! Finally, though, P7 seems highly problematic by itself. Unicorns and lollipops the size of Jupiter are substances ... so it is in their essence to exist?! 

OK, and now it should be fairly straightforward. We know that c,d, and e are all a or b, and now it's just a matter of going through all those disjunctions, proving a contradiction each time. Here is the basic set-up: 

First, 'logic' is far broader than inconsistency. You are just trying to capture inconsistency, not all of logic. Second, there are ways to obtain an inconsistent set of statements other than there being a statement and its negation in the set. For example, the set {P, P->Q, ~Q} is inconsistent, but does not explicitly contain a statement and its negation. This is why inconsistency is typically defined in terms of truth-assignments: if there is no possible truth-assignment (obeying the truth-functional constraints for the truth-functional operators as we typically define them) such that all statements in the set are true, then the set is inconsistent. 

This is the standard argument against free will on the basis of physical determinism. And there are several standard replies to this: 

I am a little concerned that you see 'philosophy' as a world view, or even a set of beliefs. Especially your question: 

As Mauro said, this statement is often referred to as the Drinker Paradox: there is someone such that if that person drinks, then everyone drinks. The statement is valid, since we know that either everyone drinks (in which case the statement is clearly true), or not everyone drinks, in which case we can point to any non-drinker to make the statement vacuously true. Your proof is unfortunately incorrect. Note how line 7 is saying that if $a$ has property F then everything has property F ... that cannot be a valid statement: just because one object a has property F should of course not imply that everything has property F. So, something is wrong. But where? That actually depends on how exactly your rules are defined ... but probably either your EE rule works a little different than you make it out to be, or you are not allowed to introduce Fa as a standalone assumption after you have introduced the a on line 2, or (as Dan suggests in the comments) on line 5 you should remove 3 from your asumption base, rather than line 1. To try and fix your proof, I would follow the strategy as mentioned before: first prove, using the Law of Excluded Middle pattern, that either everything has property F or not, and then do a proof by cases on that. 

One of the examples to demonstrate the idea of embodied or extended cognition is catching a fly ball: imagine you are in the outfield of a baseball game, and a ball gets hit in your general direction. How do you catch it? The sense-plan-act model says: figure out the speed and direction of the ball ('sense'), calculate based on the laws of mechanics where the ball is going to land, and also use mechanics to figure out how you would get to that location ('plan'), and finally execute that very plan ('act'). Notice that on this view, perception and action are 'relegated' to 'mere' input and output: yes, of course you need a perceptual-motor system to be a cognitive agent in the world, but in the end that is really 'peripheral' to the stage where 'you figure it all out'. Extended cognition is mostly a reaction to this sense-plan-act model; it states that perception and action are integral to one's mental processes. Indeed, rather than 'peripheral', perception and action are part and parcel of one's cognitive processes. In the case of catching a fly ball: keep your eyes on the ball: if in your field of vision it moves to the left, then move to the left yourself. How far? For how long? Extended cognition says: for as long as the ball no longer moves to the left in your visual field ... and if it starts going to the right, well, then you move to the right as well. Likewise, if the ball in your visual field accelerates up, then it's going to land behind you, so you should back up.... and if it decelerates, then move forward. And just jeep doing this! In other words, no internal models of the world, and no complex calculations: just constant perception-action cycles. Of course, both models have a perception-processing-action loop, but under extended cognition this loop is to be regarded as much tighter than under sense-plan-act. Indeed, whereas under sense-plan-act all the mental 'cognition' (the planning, the reasoning, the decision-making) is effectively claimed to be all 'in the head' (i.e. during the 'plan' phase) under the view of extended cognition, any explanation of one's mental and cognitive abilities will involve many perceptual-motor loops and, as such, 'cognition' is seen to be embedded in one's body, and extended into the environment. Indeed, the explanation of how one catches a baseball is really quite different under these two models, and accordingly how the brain is involved in all this. Indeed, as such, the models become testable and falsifiable.... although we'll probably need some more advancements in neuroscience to see which model has the upper hand.
