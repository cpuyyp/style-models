This depends highly on the particular model of the bike (which is due to factors like (effective) top tube length, bottom bracket height, wheel size, standover height, etc.) and your individual geometry (inseam, upper body length, arm length, leg length) and riding style (upright, prone, etc.) - the numbers don't really mean anything out of context. Even in the same class of bikes, you may go for different sizes (for example, sizing for a Specialized Sirrus may be different than for a Trek 7.4 fx (essentially flat bar road bikes). And if you listen to the marketing people, things like the specialized tricross/awol and trek crossrip are also fitness bikes (but are essentially drop bar commuter cyclocross bikes - totally different geometry). There are also bikes with hardtail mountain bike influenced geometries, such as the Trek 8.3 ds and Specialized Crosstrail. Even if you go with similar bikes (like the Trek 7._ fx series and Specialized Sirrus series), there are geometry changes which are important (like effective top tube length) for a given size. On top of that, a lot of frames come in women's geometries (marked WSD or similar or given a different model number, like the Specialized Vita being a variation of their Sirrus line for women), which don't necessarily size with their normal counterparts. The results also certainly don't carry over for different styles of riding (and thus, different styles of hybrid/fitness bikes) (my commuter, an old rigid MTB isn't the same size as my road bike, an 80s Panasonic). For example, I have a bike which is a size larger than most people of my height due to my relatively long arms and legs. Due to the number of variables, its hard (impossible?) to size a bike over the internet unless you have had a bike fit and know enough about bike geometries and your riding style and your geometry to make an educated guess. You should go to your local bike shop and ask for a bike fitting to determine the appropriate style frame and setup for the bike, and make sure to take it out on a decent test ride. They will take some measurements, plug it into a formula and get some way to set the bike (the formulas are guidelines which work for most people - they aren't exactly science). Then, they'll tweak it until it works for you. You may need to swap out things like stems or saddles or stuff on a correct sized frame (there may be more than one size which can be made to fit) in order to get it working properly. On top of that, there are a lot of "women's geometry" parts and frames which are purported to fit women riders better. You may want to mix and match these parts to a regular frame or vice versa. If you cannot afford a bike fit (they cost some money, and take a few hours), there are some videos on youtube you can look up (but really, they will not substitute for testing the bike or a good bike fit). Usually, they'll at least get you set up with a guesstimate on something that works though, for free.

Shimano road shifters have to be matched with road front derailleurs, and mountain shifters have to be matched with mountain front derailleurs (technically, you could use a pulley like a JTek Shiftmate, but thats a dumb solution due to price reasons). Theres no compatibility difference in the rear (update: see the comment - the following holds up to 9 speed between mountain and road), except mountain derailleurs are normally long cage and can take bigger cassettes (and thus are favorable in a touring context). Stick with one brand for shifters, front derailleur, rear derailleur (crossing brands is possible, but more complicated as there is no standard for how much cable shifters have to pull, and you may need pulleys to change the cable pull to get things to work). Front derailleurs are normally also matched to if they are double and triple and are specified for what range of chainwheels they work most favorably with (you can find this on the data sheet for the front derailleur - this is less important with friction on the front, but brifters can be finicky). In choosing a front derailleur, you also should make sure that the front derailleur can be mounted on your frame and the cable pull is in the right direction for your frame. The particular crankset you pick's compatibility will be determined by if you have a bottom bracket that matches it in the bike, along with if its a double/triple (matching the front derailleur) and within the appropriate tooth range and has appropriately sized tooth jumps. To quote Sheldon Brown (article linked later): "Shimano's "10-speed" triple front derailers are optimized for a 13 tooth difference, typically 52-39. Most other Shimano front triple derailers are optimized for a 10 tooth difference between middle and large ring.". The speeds on the front derailleur are marketing term - you don't really need to stick to them since the speeds are determined by whats in the back(but obviously, Shimano wants you sell you an entire groupset, and 10 speed systems use narrow chains, so you should have a 10 speed FD, 10 speed RD, 10 speed chain (you could use a lower speed FD, but it might not be as crisp) ). I recommend reading this article for seeing what goes into selecting a front derailleur and this one as well. In terms of price, the shifters will be the biggest expense and will determine the FD. Regarding the RD see the comments, so you don't need to worry about it. Once you pick the shifters, you can pick a relevant FD and crankset. Also note that a 2x10 or 3x10 setup is pricey relative to many 2/3x8 or 2/3x9 systems- the chains don't come with master links by default (and are pricey), and since things are narrower, they can be more annoying. Will the extra 1 in the rear buy you anything? Probably not. 

Note that you still have the issue of getting in a wheel with multiple cogs in the frame. This might require spreading the frame, if its steel (not a good idea on non-steel frames). As mikes and mattnz point out in the comments, you also have to add cable stops and/or cable guides to the frame to route the shift cable. Or, run full length housing and use zip ties. Problem Solvers among others make clamp on ones, and Origin 8 sells some zip tie-based cable guides you can use instead. You'll need to do a bit of searching and work probably to get the right routing, but they make cable stops that clamp onto the chainstays, the top tube, bottom tube, etc. A shop should be able to sort you out with these things relatively quickly. Other options might be to braze/weld on some. 

Yes, this does. Another option is to re-thread the cranks if you take it to the right bike shop, and then install a standard pedal. 

As an example, a Surly Crosscheck will clear something like a 700x42 while a different road bike, like a Trek 1.5 will probably have trouble clearing something bigger than a 700x28. 

That being said, you can also use a little hose attached to the pump to better access the valve like the ones offered with some Lezyne hand pumps if the chuck is too big. An example of a bendy extension hose is . There are also 90 degree extenders which you screw on: 

which is about 10 mm in diameter is a bit better (in conjunction with a good U-lock or chain lock protecting the rear wheel+frame), but it also depends on how well the cable inside is constructed. The smart thing to do is to carry around a good U-lock and lock the rear triangle of the bike with the rim to the rack, and secure the front wheel as well. Pitlock type skewers can be helpful too. Also see this youtube video: 

Go ride the bike. For some people of the same height+inseam, the 54 may be better. Others may find the 56 better. Others may find both of them are bad for them. And if you switch the model of bike, you may find the results reverse, despite the same frame size. 

Coach lines (stripes) are a type of thin stripes you saw on (typically British) cars. They were a hallmark on high end cars like Rolls Royces. See this image from from this article: 

All frames flex to some extent due to impacts or road shocks or vibrations. Some frames are better at absorbing this than others. All frame designers engineer their frames to attenuate these imperfections in riding conditions appropriately (for control/comfort reasons) by varying the size/shape of tubes and their compositions SAVE is Cannondale's marketing term for this engineering. It isn't really honest to call it a "micro-suspension" anymore than any other rigid bike -- its just the frame engineer doing their job. In a complete bike, you also have to take into account the rest of the bike beyond the frame like the saddle, handlebars, fork, tires, etc. in order to determine how comfortable/controllable the bike is. This is what you should assess the bike on, not some random marketing term. You should go for a test ride before deciding on a bike. You may find that a bike without some marketing term like SAVE is more comfortable or better value to you than one with that. Or, you may like a bike with it. It would not be advisable to base the decision on buying a bike based on whether or not it was marked SAVE (or equivalent from other manufacturers). 

We don't do product rec here, but some general advice: You want to find the biggest tires you can fit into the bike, and run them at high pressure. The pressure written on the tire sidewall is useless (the maximum pressure depends on the rim and the tire), but in all likelihood you will be close to or exceeding it on many tires. The particular model of tire won't really make a difference if you're pinch flatting them -- that is a symptom of too low pressure. Also, riding on a flat tire is bad -- you can damage the rim and wheel that way. If the biggest tire you can put in at the highest pressure you can run safely doesn't work out for you, consider switching to a rigid mountain bike, where you can easily get 2+ inch tires in, which will easily take 300 lbs. Note that running at a high pressure leaves you vulnerable to other things like road hazards damaging the wheel. You want the lowest pressure such that the rolling resistance is negligible, you avoid pinch flats, the tire absorbs some of the nature of the surface and keeps you in control of riding (i.e. no bouncing). For a 300+ lb rider, this will be a pretty high pressure on many tires. Also, remember tires are supposed to deflect a bit (visibly when you're on the bike), but not too much. If they don't deflect, they're overinflated. 

Headsets often last the life of the bicycle. They can get "brinneled" or damaged in a crash or something, but 1500 miles is absurd. As for a bottom bracket, on the low end, maybe 5000 miles. The basic Shimano one most people use (UN51/55/similar) can reasonably expect 10k+ miles. But sometimes you get unlucky and get a bottom bracket that lasts maybe 500 miles. You may have just gotten a lemon. 

The answer to this depends on your hub -- we don't know what wheel set you are running. Some manufacturers (Hope, Chris King, etc.) have released adapter kits for some their hubs to be used as 12x142 mm, however other wheel sets don't have compatible hubs. If your hub manufacturer hasn't released told you that you can do the conversion, you're out of luck and need to get new wheels. 

Rear derailleurs don't care whats up in front and vice versa. Rear derailleurs don't care about the number of cogs in the back, but front derailleurs care about the number of chain rings (you can get a triple derailleur to play nice with a double chainring, but you should probably get the right part to begin with). Speeds are mostly marketing though, as higher speed chains are narrower than lower speed chains (the only times speeds matter are in chain selection (too little speeds and the chain may be too fat), cassette (duh) and if you're using indexed shifters the shifters need to be matched to the speeds (and the appropriate cable pulls of the derailleurs)) - everywhere else, if the chain fits, it should work. For example, if you put an 8 speed chain in a FD designed for a 10 speed derailleur, it will probably rub but if you put a 9 speed chain in an 8 speed system, everything should be fine. However, using a "9 speed" front derailleur with an 8 speed system is fine (a 7 or 8 speed FD would work fine too). The only thing that matters is how much cable the shifters need to pull, and where the derailleur is mounted (top pull, etc.). Things you need to check: 

Based on comparison with the Giant Defy Advanced line, it seems to mean that you can run an electronic drivetrain (such as Shimano Di2 parts) - you have to mount things like a battery in order for the shifters to work and what not, so the frame will need to have the wiring harnesses and battery pack mounted. This link shows the TCR line in 2012 with this done. What does an electronic drive train mean for most people? Likely, just an emptier wallet. But thats a different question all together. 

1) Wheel building is non-trivial and takes practice but there are some good references (and J. Brandst, The Bicycle Wheel). I don't know if a dynamo hub will be harder than a normal hub, but the first order of business is finding a decent dynamo hub which takes a disc rotor. 2) On reusing nipples: Given how cheap nipples are, why would you bother? Though you can probably get away with it safely. 3) A built wheel is probably your best bet (along with selling the old wheel to get some of the money you're going to have to put into even getting a decent hub dynamo). Some people like Peter White Cycles (no affiliation) do wheel building for many compatible decent hub+rim combination. Note that you'll need access to a few pieces of special equipment for wheel building on top of the components - a truing stand, a spoke wrench, a dish stick and a spoke tensiometer. [Well, you don't really need the last two but they'll make your life easier]. So if you're looking to just save money (and it sounds like you are with question 2), you might find that in net, getting the wheel built by someone whose good at wheel building and stands by their work saves you money in net (and time too). 

In all likelihood, the best option is to buy a replacement hose+pump head assembly. For Nashbar products they are relatively cheap. Typically cheaper pump heads aren't really servicable, but you can try taking it apart and putting it back together (but this is likely going to be more expensive than the 5 dollars for a new pump head+hose). 

Typically your feet should not be able to touch the ground flat when you're on the seat - it is a sign that your seat is too low (you may be able to touch the ground with your toes depending on your shoe size - I wear US 13 and this is possible for me). See this link for some guidelines, but typically you get a good starting position either by experience or asking for a bike fit. Note that while saddle height is the "easiest" measurement you can setup, you also need to set the forwards/backwards position of the saddle, tilt, handlebar height and reach, etc. (which is why people do bike fits). 

Saddles are highly personal -- theres no saddle that works for everyone (and even for one person, there generally isn't a best saddle for a wide range of settings). Also, terms like aggressive are highly subjective -- whats aggressive for you may be nothing to a racer. If you have a saddle that is good for the type of riding you do, you can measure its width, length, etc. and find something similar. If you don't have a saddle thats good for the type of riding you do, you can also use fit kits to get an idea of which saddle size is right for you (Specialized and others use proprietary ones to measure your sit bones and what not; basically sit on a fancy piece of cardboard and it will measure it out for you). But, at the end of the day, you really need to try the saddle for a while in the setting that you're going to use it. Better shops should give you some leeway in returning a saddle that doesn't fit (maybe some fee or rental program), so you can try a few to find something that works for the type of riding you do. Also, note that its not just the saddle, but how you position it -- the offset and angle and height. When you change something like the stem, you'll need to change these too. A better seatpost will have more options for adjusting this. Also, as @Useless notes in the comments to the question itself, theres a bigger problem: Is the riding position you're attempting feasible given the bike you have and your body, independent of a saddle? It could be that you won't be having fun on that bike with the stem in that position regardless of the saddle setup.
