In general, though, you should always wear high-quality clothing, especially shoes. I recommend avoiding warm colors, especially red, since they can give off an aggressive aura. You can always ask about the dress code, too! I'd like to add that on a few occasions, I wore a tie to the interview but took it off when I saw that the people interviewing me were not wearing ties. In one circumstance, I asked if it would be all right to remove it, because it was killing me. The interviewers and I shared a laugh over this, and it set a much more comfortable tone. 

Yes. Usually employers ask for your availability: "when can you start?" When they ask about that, that's when you tell them your availability. No reasonable employer would expect you to cancel important plans that you made before you had even committed to a start date, but they'd want to know something like this before deciding to hire you. They might approve the two week break or they might ask you to start after you get back. Or maybe they need to fill the position quickly and they can't afford either of those options. No matter the case, they'll appreciate knowing ahead of time what your availability is. The worst case scenario is you don't tell them until after you start, and they fire you. 

After that, make a list of things you want to know, and ask about them. Do keep in mind that your personal relationship with your manager is non-existent or only just beginning, so you should keep it professional (e.g. don't ask if there are any jerks for which you should watch out.) You do not know how your manager will react yet, since you are not personally familiar with your manager. Most of the questions I can see you having, such as questions about full-time positions and advancement opportunities, may be things you should have asked during the interview process to see if the company was a good fit for your career goals. Still, you could bring these topics up; just be careful not to come off as assuming you will be offered a full-time position after your internship. If you can conceive of any reason why a question would be perceived as unprofessional or off-putting, save it for later. Better safe than sorry! 

This is a tough spot to be in. I sympathize. Unfortunately you are going to have to continue to teach yourself how to do the things you need to do in order to complete your project. As others have said there are plenty of online resources for that, so I won't parrot that advice. I'd like to help you overcome these feelings of anxiety instead. You're going to be ok! Know that all you can do is your best, and no sane employer would expect more (or less) than that. So just focus on doing your best every day. Take pride in your accomplishments. You are in a tough situation and yet you're trying your hardest to teach yourself the things you need in order to do your job. That's seriously impressive, and you should feel good about that. Though you do not have a technical mentor at your company, you probably have a manager or some employee you report your progress to. You should let them know that progress is slow without technical mentorship, but you are doing your own research to try to finish your project. It would be wise to do so with a cool head, so make sure you take time to collect yourself first. I think giving an honest update on your progress and on the problems you are facing will help shape your employer's expectations for the project outcome, and it will also be valuable feedback for them that they can use to make sure the next intern does not have the same problems you are having. Keep in mind that this is just your first internship. It's by no means going to be your last job, so don't stress too much about failure. You are likely going to do pretty well and be reviewed well, even if you don't finish, as long as you put in good work and are well liked by your manager and coworkers. So just do your best, take things in stride, and grow from this experience; in ten years, the problems you're having now will seem small and distant. 

I don't need to repeat what people said about systems like these being demotivating and easily gamed. I did notice an interesting concern of yours, though: 

There is a difference between creative ability and creative skills. The former is an overall personal quality, while the latter are concrete capabilities. If you simply say you are creative, you are implying that in a fuzzy dichotomy of the creative and the uncreative, you have enough quanta of some sort of creativity points, and are thus decidedly creative. The perception of whether someone is creative or not is the same as the perception of whether someone is funny or not, or what-have-you; it is subjective and hard to define. (The research you mention about measuring human creativity baffles me entirely; the concept of measuring a subjective quality is nonsense to me.) Now, you can demonstrate acts of creativity. From Wikipedia: 

I accepted a job offer from Company A a few months ago, but I never signed any contracts. Company B contacted me for an interview and gave me a better offer. I decided to accept it, so I notified Company A promptly that I would be rescinding my acceptance of their offer, stating that: 

...and that I was going to take it, albeit with great difficulty since I was very attracted to the offer from Company A initially. I am nonetheless happy with my decision. However, the recruiter from Company A contacted me today to tell me that she was very disappointed (Company A had put a lot of time, effort, and resources into my hiring process) and then asked: 

In the past I've taken the same approach as what all the anti-bullying PSAs always say: whenever it happens, I call it out on the spot in plain language. "That's not cool. That was an inappropriate joke, not only for this office but in general." Don't browbeat him, or make any value statements about him. Just talk about the joke being inappropriate, and quickly drop the subject. After all, the ideal scenario would be this other guy learning why his jokes are offensive and changing his behavior and mindset for the better. You aren't trying to make him feel bad about himself. This approach has the added benefit of helping to enforce a safer, inclusive office culture. If others overhear his jokes and feel uncomfortable as a result, seeing you challenge them on the spot may make them feel safer knowing that there are people willing to stand up to that behavior. If he's the type of person who will try to defend his inappropriate behavior, it's your call whether you want to challenge him further. I would not do that in the work environment; I would invite him to discuss after work. Or you can always drop it and then talk to management. Honestly, though, I've never had to deal with someone who defends themselves when called out on acting inappropriately. I think most people realize their mistakes when they're called out. Everyone seems to say, "oh, you're right. I didn't realize I was acting inappropriately. Thanks for letting me know." 

Answer the questions you can. When you can't answer a question, say you don't know the answer, but offer to help the other developer find the answer. Pair with them and dive into the code and figure it out together. Your willingness to help will be appreciated and people will look to you for guidance. You will also learn about this legacy codebase so that you can answer questions better. Oh, and you'll learn a lot of other good leadership skills. If you're cut out for a tech lead kind of role, you'll naturally grow into it as you do this. No one magically knows everything. Good leaders are good at learning quickly and making informed decisions. So just focus on that instead of worrying about what you don't know right now. 

If you are worried about evaluating people based on how you feel at the time of evaluation and not based on their performance over the year, just keep track of how you'd evaluate them at each month or so and keep (private) notes on this. I think all good managers who are tracking the development of their employees should do this as it helps give some insight into what external factors influenced the employees' behavior when you look back and think "what was the company doing at this time when they were behaving such-and-such way?" (By the way, if you have a subordinate that gets into a fight [verbal or otherwise] with you or any coworker, that's probably against your company code of conduct and should be subject to disciplinary actions. I wouldn't rate any employee who got into a fight as "good" let alone "outstanding." But that's beside the point.) 

You should, first and foremost, tackle logistics. This will make your first day go much more smoothly - a pleasant experience for everyone involved. Some examples:
