Yes 100%. Ask too many questions, outside the interview is a sign of immaturity. They have given you a contact, and expect you to sign it. Your job now is fulfil the contract agreements and simply do whatever the company wants you to do. People are busy. They don't have time to respond to your "many" questions. Stop being dubious, work out the solutions and do it. Successful brands like Apple has a culture like this: 

Please keep in mind that you didn’t commit anything suspicious - you cheated nobody. Your clients might (but you're not 100% sure), but you didn’t. You provided your services but you didn’t submit the projects to the university. It’s like a gun shop selling a gun legally. You as the seller is not responsible for any resulting violence. You are a paid professional. There is no reason why you should hide it. 

You can't BS in a technical interview, what you have in your resume doesn't matter. Anybody who knows the field can easily test your knowledge in the first 10-minute of the interview. If you don't have the skills to even consider for an entry job, you will need to consider other alternatives. Jobs that require less technical skills such as truck driving. Sorry, that's life. 

You are simply too smart for the company. When they said “best” it was only “average” to someone like you. Your machine learning knowledge was too good for the company. Don’t waste your time. Quit your job. You will need to find someone like Andrew Ng to work with. Forget about linear regression, aim yourself higher - consider something like a self driving car system with a 10000 layers deep recurrent network. No training time, it just work with perfect performance. 

If he can't be fired and you aren't able to change his personality, you hire a new person or you do it yourself. You mentioned you have 2.5 years of experience and is very good at programming. You also mentioned you like debugging. Why don't you just do it yourself? Your boss will be happy, and everybody will be fine. 

You, as an individual employee is not responsible for any potential legal matters, it's simply not your problem. Furthermore, nobody knows you use the community version for profits, so it's fine. Go ahead with the community version if this is sufficient for you. Few hundred dollars per year isn't very expensive for a business. You could ask the costs deducted from your salary. Once your boss (using your salary) buys a professional license, you could share it on a virtual machine for yourself and your colleagues. Remotely connect to the virtual machine from your computer. Talk to your boss and aim for only a single license copy. This is a win-win, you get to use better software and your boss wouldn't need to adjust her budget. 

You could give a call to the company asking for "Alex". You should tell the receptionist "Alex" knows you. Don't tell the reception your real name. Once you hear his/her voice on the phone, immediately hung up. Don't use your registered phone number on the resume. 

I don't understand, why would you insist to purchase a license? Why spend the money? Do you know you can run a virtual machine (e.g VirtualBox)? You'll install a trial version on the VM everytime the license expires. It's free, reliable and commonly used in the software industry. I'd expect this is assumed knowledge for a developer. EDIT: To downvoters, please leave a message on why my answer deceives a downvote? I always use VM for installing trial softwares without paying. It's legal. 

While you're free to add your hobby inspiration onto your resume, unless you have solid data science skills, nobody will seriously consider you for a data scientist position. Your situation is just like a high school boy after reading "Dummy guide for mobile app programming", apply for a 6-figures mobile development application job. Do you really believe the boy would have the experience to compete with yourself; a professional mobile app developer? Similarly, why do you think you have the qualification (e.g. some random online courses) to compete with a dozen of PhD data scientist candidates?? Do you think the hiring manager in your current company would consider hiring the high school boy for your position? Someone who had no mobile app experience, nor any reasonable qualification? Why do you think you will get the exemption when you apply for other jobs?? Statistics is deep and hard, and out of reach for someone who has done just a few online courses. Please note you'll compete with people who have a PhD in statistics, guys who publish on statistical journals. I don't want to be harsh, but I see many unqualified resumes like that. You're living in your own dream, please wake up. @Sascha is right. You're giving the hiring manager an impression that you're trying to waste their time; they will soon hire another mobile app developer to replace you. Why not just simply trash your resume into the recycle bin, interview another candidate??? 

GPA is irreverent for software programming jobs. In fact you don’t even need a university degree for software programming. If your aim is just to be a software programmer, pleaser consider drop your university. High school education is more than enough. It’s useless, waste of time and expensive. No reasonable recruiter will even look at your education section on your CV. Getting a degree for a programmer position is like going to university for becoming a taxi driver. Kill it before too late. 

I'd send the following screenshot to your coworker and CC the boss. I'm sure it'll work and your boss will follow up the issue. 

Unfortunately, this is common in the industry. It's a bad thing to management but good thing to you. You shouldn't need to do anything, relax yourself and work causally. As long as your productivity is still better than the coworker, you won't be the last and won't be fired. It's a good job for you. 

Why would you feel angry? Unless you have a signed contract, you weren't obligated to read those articles. Similarly, the company had no obligation to offer you an employment. Do you really think you should get a position just because you read those materials? Most if not all other candidates could also do that. Why do you think your reading time should land you a job automatically? You did that as a volunteer, nobody forced you. The hiring manager did nothing wrong, you're being unprofessional. OK... you weren't notified on the promised date, but that was quite common. 

You're not affirmed with them, so you don't need to give any response. Ignore and delete their emails then move on. They're not paying you, you get nothing by responding. The company is useless to you. Do nothing. 

We're adults, we don't need conversation. Immediately send the person a termination letter. As a senior manager you'd need to prove your authority. Anybody who disrespects you must go. Please safeguard the company asset before you actually give out the letter. Think like Donald Trump, anybody who doesn't obligate the president must be sacked. That's what management is about. Other than the managing director, there shouldn't be anybody in the company that you can't terminate. You should only hire your followers. Not a follower? find a replacement. EDIT My answer is not a joke, it's a serious attempt at solving the situation. Rex Tillerson was terminated by Donald Trump for exactly the same reason. It is working for the US government. As a senior manager, you have to show your authority. Find someone else more qualified. 

Don't bother with an English certificate, because anybody who speaks to you for a few minutes in an English interview understand your level. In my experience, certificate is useless in web development programming jobs. Focus on your technical skills. 

You do the phone screening yourself. Don't make an excuse like you're busy. If you feel the HR is incompetent, you take it yourself. A technical phone interview should take like 10 minutes, do it while you're buying a coffee. Prepare a few fundamental questions. Inform the HR their time is too precious for the screening. You ask the HR to do simple filtering such as incomplete CV, job titles clearly not matched the job description, no cover letter, no working visa etc. But you do the actual phone screening. They'll be happy to do less work for the same pay.
