This is the best I could find on this type of profane theatre. I found a lot on religious theatre, so I get the impression (rightly or wrongly) that much of the theatre was religious at the time and consequently (I'm assuming) not very erotic. If you start reading from p200 it talks about nudity in Byzantine media. It seems that "nude images were associated with paganism" (except when portraying Adam and Eve, etc) and the official view was one condemning it. Disappointingly the articles examples (naked monks and fighters) are fairly un-erotic. However this insight on Byzantine attitudes to nudity in theatre is interesting, and suggest they focused on the shame and unusualness of nudity rather than the erotic element. On p198 there is, however descriptions of "cavorting maenads" (female followers of Dionysus) in Byzantine wood-work and on p200 there's an extract from a poem with possible erotic overtones. The Decoration of the Sevastokratorissa’s Tent: "My lady, muse of muses, akropolis of beauty, the porch of your tent is filled with delights. Cupids are plucking strings and quietly strumming the cithara, satyrs seem to play, the centaurs gambol, the muses join in the dance, the nereids are leaping." Add to that the wikipedia article, which seems to suggest that erotic romance was a popular theme in poetry at the time. It's not theatre, but it reasonable to say that erotic literature suggests the existence of erotic theatre. 

When you say "with war", I'm assuming you don't mean to count all the land of a country at war. For example, I'm not sure Kent is any more "fought over" because of the many Anglo-Indian Wars. I imagine you mean what land has had soldiers fighting on it most, both in terms of time and also intensity (how expensive to human life this ground has been). Given this idea of "most fought over land" I believe this land is to be found on the western front, this is the greatest example of extended and brutal military campaigns with very little movement and an obvious starting point. More specifically I think the land around Verdun was the "most fought over". The largest military operations include The Battle of Verdun. Firstly, this battle was clearly of the scale to qualify the land as very fought over (755,000–976,000 causalities). It's admittedly not the largest battle on this list (beat by other battles of ww2 and ww1, including the Somme), however what makes it stand out is that there was very little movement of forces after the battle. This is often said of the western front in general, but if you look at the other major battle, The Battle of the Somme, you'll find that as the battle closed the Germans withdrew 40 miles to the Hindenburg line. No such retreat occurred in Verdun, the sector around it's fortification systems remained the focus of fighting from the German invasion of France in 1914 to Armistice 1918. If you look at this map you can see how Verdun remained in constant contention during ww1. edit: If it's just brutality in a small space the obvious answer is Leningrad or Stalingrad. 

This question may get closed, but I think it's interesting (and doubtless history fans love C. S. Forester more than people on any book site) and so I will sneak in an answer before that happens. PUBLICATION :: The Happy Return; A Ship of the Line; Flying Colours; The Commodore; Lord Hornblower; Mr Midshipman Hornblower; Lieutenant Hornblower; Hornblower and the Atropos; Hornblower in the West Indies; Hornblower and the Hotspur; (Hornblower and the Crisis - incomplete) CHRONOLOGICAL :: Mr Midshipman Hornblower; Lieutenant Hornblower; Hornblower and the Hotspur; (Hornblower and the Crisis - incomplete); Hornblower and the Atropos; The Happy Return; A Ship of the Line; Flying Colours; The Commodore; Lord Hornblower; Hornblower in the West Indies Clearly since these differ it isn't important to the narrative to read them chronologically, but it may have advantages as far as seeing Hornblower's career evolve or seeing the general story of that time period (Napoleonic wars) take place. But The "Happy Return" (Or "Beat to quarters" if you're in the US) is the one that was designed to hook new readers in and probably holds you by the hand a bit more exposition wise. By reading this first you avoid starting with perhaps weaker books (I don't know, I like all the ones I read but the first was strong enough to start a series) and end up having a mild form of the experience of someone who starts watching "Star Wars" at episode 1 and quits before the good ones. If you watch the excellent Meridian Television TV series though you might want to read Chronologically as the series covers the three books: Mr. Midshipman Hornblower, Lieutenant Hornblower, and Hornblower and the Hotspur. 

I believe one of the most interesting examples is Varosha in Cyprus. It's an abandoned city in the UN buffer zone that was abandoned quite suddenly (I believe people intend to return, so all their things are still there) in 1974 during the Turkish invasion. In fact there are many examples of UN buffer zones. I don't know whether this is quite "No-mans land" but there are ones on the Israeli borders with both Syria and Lebanon. 

I believe the "Tooth-to-tail ratio", the ratio of combat personnel to support personnel, is a useful guide for how many troops would have been involved in fighting. This is a slightly dodger proposition today in wars without a front-line (where logistics personal have a very real prospect of being engaged), but seems reasonable for WW2. I happen to be concentrating on American figures rather than British. The Other End of the Spear: The Tooth-to-Tail Ratio (T3R) in Modern Military Operations by John J. McGrath provides some of the information we need on this. For example it seems that while US command aimed for 65% combat troops, they attained about 40% in the European theatre. Later on, US forces in Korea has almost the same TtT ratio so this seems generally applicable. I will be assuming the theatre TfT ratio this is very close to the Army TfT ratio, but given the size of the army compared to other services this seems reasonable. Here are Wikiepdia's causalities figures of course. But, the Congress Research Service have some that differentiate by service, so I'll be using these and looking only at the army. There were about 235,000 "battle deaths" and 83,400 other deaths out of about 11.2 million soldiers. Death rate here of 2.8%. Assuming our 40% combat troops ratio applies to the army generally, that gives us about 4.5 million combat personnel. Which results in about a 6% death rate if we attribute all battle deaths and a proportional share of the "other" deaths to these combat personnel. All these numbers are a bit less than triple that if we include non mortal wounding as well (ie casualties rather than deaths). And I will say I've made more assumptions here than I am happy with, so don't get too excited about these numbers. 

$URL$ Seems to address cold weather clothing very well. It seems they did what we did, scarfs, multiple layers, hats, enclosed boots etc but with the exception of trousers, which they saw as barbarian. They went for lower leg coverings instead. I would point out these guys seem to manage without trousers. Except actually some of them did wear trousers as well because it's usual for armies to incorporate local gear into their kit. The Romans were also quite good at using foreign ideas, their spanish swords (Gladius) being an example, the interesting part of their cold weather gear is how they didn't really do that with trousers. 

The assumption I make here is the origin of Anglo-American ranks is the origin of English ranks. Not unreasonable. "Lieutenant" derives from the French words: "lieu" - "in place" and "tenant" - "holding", it's someone who assumes command in place of the actual commander. As you said, a captain having lieutenants makes sense and pre-dated professional armies with formalised rank structures 1. Major, meaning "superior" or "elder" in (medieval) Latin is also a logical step. Sergeant meaning "servant", corporal meaning "head" etc. These are all great prefixes to add to ranks like Colonel and General, but are probably more prefixes than we need. Captain general is a rank we used to have but now don't, for example. It seems reasonable to say that rank formalisation came about with the first professional army. All these ranks clearly existed before, but this is the only point where a leader of trained band couldn't just 'decide' they were a "lieutenant major". This Document, The Officer List of The New Model Army, suggest that a modern rank structure existed in the New Model Army (the parliamentarian army during the English Civil War often recognised as being the first English professional army). This army was disbanded, but the 26th January 1661 Charles II issued the Royal Warrant that created the first permanent professional Infantry Regiments, renewing this rank system and introducing the sale of Commissions I found this blog post funny, the conclusion here is that a bunch of different and inconsistent ranks got shoved together and gaps filled by adding major or lieutenant to existing ranks, the result being madness. And that's sort of the point, ranks were developed by a mix of natural evolution and arbitary decision making in the 17th century, with these prefixed ranks filling the gaps as operationally required. The historical importance and independence of Captains being perhaps why we lack lieutenant Majors. Also, If you've ever wondered why major general is below lieutenant general it's because the former is a contraction of sergeant major general, which itself was an extension of an earlier meaning of sergeant major.
