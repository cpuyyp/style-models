A good approach to improve the situation is to first take a hard look at your own actions and your own communications. If possible, get a trusted friend or your partner to take an unbiased look. Make sure that your e-mail actually conveys the message you intended it to convey and that your actions cannot be misinterpreted. A second step is to have an open dialog with your project manager. Explain your thought process behind your actions to him. Try to get him to explain what his concerns were in response to your actions. I think you will discover that you are not both on the same page in terms of both understanding your motivations and understanding his reaction. A third step is to try to put yourself in the other person's shoes before communicating and make sure you give them enough background or context in order to properly understand your message and intentions. For example, "Hey XXX, we've been waiting for some time for the client to get back to us on this issue. I think there's a good chance they won't want us to resolve it. I had some free time and I saw that QA seems overloaded right now so I went ahead and did the final testing and prepared a package so we're ready to go if the client doesn't need us to resolve that issue. I put it in a secure place so no one will accidentally send it through without client confirmation as that's the last thing we'd want." A fourth step is when you get unexpected responses to close the loop and make sure you understand why you are getting that reaction. For example, "You seem pretty concerned about this getting out to the customers. Has that happened before? Do we have safeguards to prevent it from happening accidentally? I certainly don't want something untested going out the door either." 

There are several reasons to hire a consultant. First, in spite of their "high prices", consultants are almost always cheaper than in-house staff. The cost of an employee to a company is much more than just his or her salary. An employee also has a bonus, has benefits, needs training, uses IT infrastructure, takes up a desk in an office building, builds up a retirement, may have significant costs if laid off (e.g. in Europe), etc. All of these increase an employee's cost, and, in large companies, this is significant. It's not unusual for an employee to cost a project significantly more than $250 / hour when you look at the internal accounting system. The high consultant fee includes all (or nearly all) costs for that consultant. Second, consultants may have expertise in an area that the company does not want to or cannot economically justify building up. For example, if the company's core business is producing beverages, it may make sense for them to hire consultants to build software systems for them. That is, the beverage company may choose to focus on their core business and choose to hire in experts in areas they don't know much about to help them out. It may be more costly or difficult, for example, for them to find and attract IT-savvy management and technical staff to build the necessary infrastructure, and they may only need the majority of that IT expertise long enough to get the system up and running. 

It should not be a problem to send an e-mail to your colleagues to let them know that you are moving on. I have seen this done and no one has questioned it. 

Given your explanation of the timelines, I suspect she felt no rush to start the paperwork until closer to your defense as it likely could not be finalized until after your defense. This was probably why she was lax in getting the process started and in communicating updates to you. This was probably not intentional on her part. She was likely busy with typical teaching duties and kicking off the new project. The fact that the professor did not communicate better with you about what was going on with the process was a major failure on her part. Even if, as I suspect, she could not formally complete the process with you until after your defense, she should have made this clear and given you any necessary assurances that the process would start immediately after your defense. By telling her you have other offers, you have shown her that she has made a potentially serious mistake and may now need to find other suitable candidates. It's natural for her to be upset by this, and there's a small possibility you have burned the bridge with her. You mention in your comments that your other offers are in industry rather than academia. You should be aware that it is typical to get a much better compensation package in industry than in academia. The work, work environment and long term career tracks are also very different between industry and academia. Given your current situation, I see two potential choices: 

If you are in a country where a PIP is required before you can be fired, your company will likely embrace letting you go early with some severance. They may even be hoping for this outcome as it would preclude the possible risk of you suing them for wrongful termination. 

Working within an existing system is a valuable skill as a developer. It helps you learn to read code, value good design and documentation, and fit your solution into a larger whole even when you would rather do it differently. It will also teach you or encourage you to find supporting tools out there to make maintenance tasks simpler. I can't emphasize the value of being able to read and understand someone else's code enough. A good senior developer should be able to understand how a reasonably complex system works just by exploring the code without the need to set breakpoints and actually step through the code while it's executing. In short, I think you are underestimating what you can learn from maintenance work in a legacy system, especially at such an early stage in your career. I encourage you to stick it out a while longer and try to develop your "engineering" part of the "software engineering" skillset. 

Finding good quality candidates is a lot of work. Many companies choose not to have full time recruiters / recruitment teams in house and instead use recruiters. It's perfectly normal to be contacted by the recruiter. They will have typically been given details on specific roles that the company is looking to fill. 

Use your personal understanding of the meeting topic and the intended audience to prepare a clear message and answers to questions that may be common. This is really meeting, audience and organization specific so there is no catch-all technique. If appropriate, do a practice meeting or review your intended presentation material with a trusted audience to get feedback and understand what questions they had that you may not have been prepared to answer. Use good communication skills and techniques to get your message across and keep the meeting on topic. This helps ensure people understand what you are saying so they have fewer questions. It also helps prevent them from steering the meeting off-topic with inappropriate questions. Rely on your general background and experience to help you answer those questions that you can related to the meeting topic. Politely and directly refuse to answer questions that you cannot or will not answer for legal or other reasons. Admit when you do not have the answer immediately to other questions and either follow up yourself or point the person asking the question to a suitable resource to get more information. 

A good team should promote knowledge sharing. It should be no problem for you to approach your more senior coworker and say something like, "I came across this information in the documentation that seems relevant for what you're doing. Have you seen this?" 

Maybe not the answer you are looking for, but good leaders are focused on the needs of the team and are working to make the team successful. It sounds like you have good motivations as a leader. Any company that is serious about promoting technical people to leadership positions will be familiar with the common struggles. I would encourage you to discuss the areas you are struggling with with your boss. There are soft skills and leadership training courses he or she might be able to send you on to help you out. Your boss might also be able to set up regular sessions to coach you or review your plans with you as you get used leading the team. Remember that your boss should have the same motivation: to make his or her team (including you) successful. 

Review your company's ethics policy or manual if they have one. Some companies oblige you to raise this type of concern or else face consequences later if it turns out to be an issue that you were aware of and did nothing about. 

It's good that you recognize communication issues, but you seem to be taking the approach that the other person needs to change in order for you to be successful. You do not have control over your supervisor, but there are things you can do from your side to make the communication more effective:
