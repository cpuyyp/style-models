I don't have numbers on hand for the density of interstellar gas, so I can't speak to the plausibility of using it for the middle part of your journey. However, I can attempt to analyze the other parts of your plan anyway: First off, tritium is radioactive, with a half-life around twelve years (source). You're not going to want to store it in large tanks- or, indeed, store it at all. Better to use deuterium-deuterium fusion, deuterium-helium3 fusion, or other, heavier stable isotopes; or use the neutrons produced by the fusion reactor to generate tritium on the fly. In addition, you're not going to be able to use any magnetic field generated by your ship to slow down, unless you're moving into an area where there's actually something to push on, in which case you might be able to use it like a parachute. I wouldn't count on it, though; better to just turn around and use your main engines to slow down once you get halfway there. Also, rockets don't really have any kind of maximum speed. There's no reason to coast for the middle part of the trip if unless you need to save fuel for later (i.e. to slow down)- and if your Bussard engine is indeed able to collect enough fuel from the interstellar medium, there's no reason to turn it off. Finally, you're not likely to find large amounts of the rarer isotopes you might use as fusion fuels (deuterium, helium3) in the destination system, so it'd be best to being enough of those for the return trip. Hydrogen and oxygen though? There ought to be plenty. Or, more precisely, by the time this ship could be built, there will be telescopes powerful enough to know what systems have plenty of icy comets and asteroids to mine for water, and you'll be heading toward one of those. Do note that even hydrogen-hydrogen fuel probably creates extra neutrons, and those could in principle be used to breed more deuterium, tritium, and helium-3. You'll have to look up the numbers on that to see if doing so would be more feasible than just bringing along enough of the rare isotopes for the return trip. Now, on to your actual questions: I'd say this design, using a fusion rocket to accelerate to the speeds needed for the Bussard jet to work well, sounds fairly reasonable, if it turns out that fusion rockets work, Bussard ramjets work if and only if they are accelerated to a high speed, and fusion rockets are capable of accelerating your ship to those speeds. What velocities could be reached? I have no idea. It all depends on the exhaust velocity of your rockets and how much fuel you want to bring along. See here. What must be taken into account when designing the ship, and what dangers may arise? That's... a very broad question, and I won't even pretend to hit all possible concerns. But you'll need to shield your occupants from cosmic rays, relativistic particles of interstellar dust, space rocks, and radiation from your own engines. You'll need food and water, light, communications equipment, and places for your passengers to sleep and pass their time during the day. And either some way to fix anything that goes wrong, when things go wrong; or enough redundancy to ensure that anything that breaks won't cause any difficulties until you get back to Earth. Or, preferably, both. Because there's always something you'll miss. Advantages and disadvantages of the hybrid setup over pure fusion or pure Bussard? Well, I've already mentioned the main advantage: if the Bussard jet can only collect enough interstellar hydrogen to bother with if it's traveling close to the speed of light, you'll need some other way to get it up to relativistic speeds. Fusion rockets are potentially one way to do that, and are no less feasible than the Bussard jet itself. After all, the Bussard engine is essentially a fusion drive with the fuel tanks replaced with a giant magnetic scoop. The disadvantages? It's heavier and more complex, so there are more things that could break. But the Bussard jet should be more compatible with classic fusion drives than with, say, nuclear pulse propulsion- after all, the hard part is getting the hydrogen you've collected to fuse into helium so you can spew the hot plasma out the back of your rocket. Taking a Bussard jet and bolting on a tank or two of hydrogen isotopes for use when the scoop isn't active doesn't seem like a major problem to me. It'll make your ship heavier, simply because you're carrying around an extra tank or two of hydrogen isotopes; but you won't need much more in the way of plumbing or anything like that. 

Almost all well explored abilities can, with a little creativity, have semi-believable disadvantages just slapped on. Unfortunately, most of the more flamboyant abilities (various kinesis types, shape-shifting), have very powerful advantages and would require even more devastating measures for balance. For most, throwing fireballs is totally worth it for lethargy afterwards. For example: The good: Light telepathy, allowing only for generalized mind reading (like sensing aggravation or lie detection) but nothing as complex as stealing specific thoughts or memories. The bad: Reading someones mind (as described above) takes focus and short range (5-10m) line of sight. Further, all stress, anxiety and likewise conditions of others nearby accumulate on the reader, obviously causing mental instability on most users. 

Wikipedia ballparks earth's total biomass at 560 billion tons C*. If the blobs are able to consume all life, given a rough estimate of bacterial volume/weight (0.6um3/picogram) lands a rough mass at. The volume of the Mediterranean Sea (I am skeptical about this answer and open to revisions) 

Sure. If they evolved the way I outlined above, they'll be mostly carnivores- but if they can eat fruit, that could help them get through periods of scarce prey. 

Plants create oxygen as a byproduct of photosynthesis, using energy from sunlight to break apart molecules of water and carbon dioxide and reform them into carbohydrates (such as glucose) and oxygen. If you want a substantial amount of oxygen in your atmosphere, that oxygen has to come from somewhere- either from oxides in the ground (most likely quartz crystals or metal ores), or from CO2 in the air. And liberating oxygen from any such source requires energy. That energy has to come from somewhere. There are a few exothermic reactions that release oxygen (such as the "oxygen candles" popular on submarines: $3NaClO_3 + 2Fe \to 3NaCl + Fe_2O_3 + 3O_2$), but their reactants (sodium chlorate and iron metal, in this case) have to be more reactive than oxygen in order for the reaction to work at all. By the time life starts developing on your planet, any such compounds will have already broken down, and any oxygen released will be bound up in things like quartz, iron oxide, and carbon dioxide. You mention fungi and the parasitic dodder plant, and that they do not produce oxygen. This is true. Fungi are actually more closely related to animals than to plants; they produce energy by breaking down biomass produced by other organisms and reacting it with oxygen to produce water and carbon dioxide. In order to produce oxygen, your "plants" will need to need another source of energy to break down oxygen-containing compounds (most likely carbon dioxide) in order to get at the non-oxygen components, and release the oxygen as a byproduct. All Earth plants power this process with sunlight, because it's abundant and it works. However, some organisms have other energy sources. The chemosynthetic bacteria in giant tube worm guts, for instance, create carbohydrates by reacting carbon dioxide with hydrogen sulfide: $$12H_2S + 6CO_2 \to C_6H_{12}O_6 + 6H_2O + 12S$$ This produces solid sulfur as a byproduct, rather than oxygen; however, a chemosynthetic organism with a source of hydrogen could react it with carbon dioxide instead: $$6H_2 + 6CO_2 \to C_6H_{12}O_6 + 3O_2$$ Such a hydrogen-eating organism might release oxygen as a byproduct; or, more likely, it could react the oxygen with more hydrogen to produce water and quite a bit more energy. $$12H_2 + 6CO_2 \to C_6H_{12}O_6 + 6H_2O$$ However, I doubt that chemosynthesis will play a major part in your planet's ecosystem. As on Earth, chemosynthetic organisms will be relegated to dark, oxygen-poor areas with sources of reactive chemicals such as hydrothermal vents at the bottom of the oceans. Instead, the foundation of the ecosystem will be based on photosynthesis. You've got a planet with a high axial tilt where, even in the dead of winter in the polar regions that get only a few hours of sunlight per day, the temperatures rarely drop below freezing. There's only two ways for that to be possible: either there's some serious greenhouse effects going on, or the lower latitudes and the summer months get a ridiculous amount of sunlight. If there's a strong greenhouse effect, that means that there's a lot of carbon dioxide, methane, or other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Gases such as methane will quickly react with all the oxygen that you have; while the presence of large amounts of CO2 indicates (to me, at least) that your plants aren't doing a very good job of absorbing it and converting it into oxygen. Which leaves sunlight. And lots of it. Photosynthetic plant life will be even more abundant on your planet than it is on Earth. However, you also note that you don't want everything to be green. No problem: there are many different pigments that Earth plants use for photosynthesis, with green chlorophyll only being the most common. See the table here: chlorophyll a is the familiar green stuff, chlorophyll b is yellow, chlorophyll c is blueish-green, chlorophyll d is found in red algae, and chlorophyll f absorbs far infrared light, so it probably appears colorless to our eyes. No one's quite sure why chlorophyll a, which mostly reflects green light, is the most common chlorophyll on modern Earth. After all, the Sun produces more green light than any other color, so it seems like the most common types of plants would be adept at absorbing green light. 

Companies can adopt a reputation scheme as follows. Near the start-up, companies will strive to produce the best product their resources will allow, squeezing every last ounce of quality into them. Meanwhile, messengers are sent all around the known world spreading news about the "amazing X company" and of course provide accessibility to the products. If the company manages to catch on, their fame will rapidly skyrocket their product quality, but in turn they wont need to even try to improve any further. Companies will gain undefeatable monopolies. 

As the population of prey begins to falter, so does the blob's ability to find food. They then begin to die off and the prey population rises again only to repeat the process. But what if they are apex predators. It is possible that, since they eat organic matter, no digestive system could completely dispose of them. Following the next month or so, the blob eats the eater, quickly teaching all species to steer clear. 

There are two tools at your disposal, as a science-based worldbuilder, that can provide answers to questions like this one. They are Special Relativity and General Relativity. Your question reminds me of the classic Twin Paradox. In this paradox, one member of a pair of identical twins takes a trip on a rocket at near the speed of light, while the other stays at home on Earth. When the traveler returns, they will have aged less than their stay-at-home sibling. If you replace the rocket with your unusual planet and just kind of have it accelerate around the galaxy (by attaching it to a big rocket or something), you could arrange it so that 10 days there take the same amount of time as 40 years here. That's exactly the opposite of what you're going for. Since that didn't work, let's try placing your planet in orbit around a large black hole. Gravitational time dilation causes time to pass more slowly the deeper you are in a gravitational well. As an example, the Earth's core is about 2.5 years younger than its surface. This is, once again, exactly the opposite of what you're going for. You could solve this by attaching Earth to a big rocket or putting Earth in orbit around a large black hole, but that doesn't exactly answer the spirit of your question. So here's what I propose: It's not relativistic weirdness that's causing time on your planet to behave weirdly; it's the planet's portal. Maybe these portals have built-in clocks that keep them synchronized, so that one hour on any planet is one hour on any other. Perhaps whoever built the portals added this feature to counteract the effects of gravitational time dilation on planets orbiting large black holes. In any case, the clock in this planet's portal is damaged, and is running some 1460 times slower than it should. As a result, if you come to Earth from this planet, stay for ten days, and then go back there, you'll arrive once the portal thinks ten days have passed... but since the portal's clock is running slow, you will actually have been gone for forty years. This solution does horribly violate causality, but so does literally any form of faster-than-light transportation. You've already completely broken physics; this doesn't break it any more. 

The first thing to accept is that the human race does not have a single mind. The criteria that helps someone decide not to research these alternate humans will cause someone else to. In other words, there will always be people that want to study them, but there are some countermeasures. It's inhumane As a front-line defense, make sure they have similar biology. Very similar. So similar that any attempt to study them would turn up results exactly the same as any human. In this light, media (and social media) would begin to take over. While this is merely a superficial solution, it will at least halt large scale, public research and overall reduce funding towards like studies. It's illegal Something atrocious happened half a century ago involving horrible experiments on the species. Over the following years, laws were put in place making the suggestion of trying to understand them highly sensitive. Once it's tied up in politics and made controversial, a great amount of support will be needed to change the status quo. It's complex Just make their various abilities too difficult too understand. Maybe the details span with information several orders of magnitude larger. Maybe some as of yet undiscovered scientific principle gets in the way of recording data. Something physically prevents them from grasping their nature. Or maybe passive telepathy bores all the researchers to death. 

While I am certainly not qualified to analyze all the possible effects of all those different factors, I can take a stab at some of the simpler-looking ones. Say the ideal griffin has the body of a lion (250 kg and 3.0 meters long, call it), and the wings of a bald eagle scaled up to match the length and width of the lion. Typical bald eagles can have a length of 1.02 m, a 2.3 m wingspan, and 6.3 kg mass. Scaling that up by a factor of 3 gives a bird 3.06 m long, with a 6.9 m wingspan. If I assume that lift is probably proportional to the area of the bird's wings, which is proportional to the square of the wingspan, this eagle should be able to lift 56.7 kg (9 times its Earth mass) and then some. Which is less than the mass of the bird itself (170.1 kg = 6.3 kg * 3^3), and nowhere near the mass of our lion. That's the Square-Cube Law in action. However, that's not the end of the story. If we want the griffin to be able to lift its 250-some kilograms as easily as our giant Earthbound eagle can lift 56.7 kg of its mass, we can reduce gravity and thicken the atmosphere to compensate. To fly on the planet (call it P), we need $$F_{l_P} \ge F_{g_P}$$ (read that as "Force of lift on P $\ge$ force of gravity on P") Since a denser atmosphere there will give more lift as compared to Earth $$F_{l_E} \cdot \frac{\rho_P}{\rho_E} \ge F_{g_P}$$ Substituting in mass * gravitational acceleration for those forces (from Newton's second law of motion, F = ma) $$m_{equiv} \cdot g_E \cdot \frac{\rho_P}{\rho_E} \ge m \cdot g_P$$ where $m_{equiv}$ is the 56.7 kg figure calculated above. Rearranging that a bit gives $$\frac{m_{equiv} \cdot \rho_P}{\rho_E} \ge \frac{m \cdot g_P}{g_E}$$ After substituting in some known values $$\frac{56.7 \cdot \rho_P}{\rho_E} \ge \frac{250 \cdot g_P}{g_E}$$ And after rearranging again $$\frac{\rho_P}{\rho_E} \ge 4.41 \frac{g_P}{g_E}$$ So the atmosphere on this planet would need to be about 4.5 times as dense as Earth's, or gravity at its surface would need to be 4.5 times weaker, or somewhere in between. In theory. I'd recommend reducing gravity by at least a factor of 3, if not 4. This goes back to the square-cube law: Even though the cross-sectional area (and thus the strength) of the eagle's wing bones increased by a factor of 9, the griffin weighs much more than 9 times what an eagle weighs. So the griffin's wings might just break whenever it tries to take off in Earth gravity, denser atmosphere or no. The question then becomes: Could a planet with much less gravity than Earth actually hold onto such a thick atmosphere long enough for griffins to evolve? Sure. Venus and Titan both have much thicker atmospheres than Earth does; and Titan's gravity is much weaker as well. I do not know why these conditions exist on those worlds, but clearly they do. Finally, would such a creature actually evolve in such an environment? I doubt it; not as I described. Lions are big and bulky; the classical griffin would surely be outcompeted by something with a smaller, lighter, more aerodynamic body- something more birdlike, in short. As for the more reptilian design in your question? Sure. Maybe. I don't know. I'm no biologist. As for riding them: No idea, but you'll probably have better luck with birdlike wings that just attach to the griffin's shoulders than with batlike wings extending all the way to the hind legs and tail. If people are going to saddle these things, they'll need somewhere to put their feet, and bat wings would get in the way. Unless the rider was perched more on the griffin's shoulders, in which case the weight of the rider would be seriously unbalancing. Dragonriding has similar issues that have already been discussed here on Worldbuilding... somewhere. 

Magical ability can simply be mapped to a square root function. More emotion added does not mean an equal addition in power. Instead, the difficulty in increasing power raises with the power, tapering off eventually. Where this tapering happens is based on whatever you would like to use (different for each person, random, etc). The second limitation is in context. There are multiple types of situations we would prefer aren't magically amped-up, like 5-year old tantrums or adolescent blowups. A number of solutions are possible. Maybe magic increases with age or maturity, it may even be blocked by hormones. :) Alternatively just leave the one rule how it is. Instead of modifying the rule, modify society. Who needs cars when you can get angry and run 80 kph. Even tools are useless to a degree as beating your head against a wall actually might smash the wall. 

Almost definitely not. The sheer amount of energy required to lift an object of this magnitude would be far out of its capabilities. The only plausible escape of gravity would be partial, meaning it would be trivial to fling small pieces of the blob out of the planet's gravity well provided the blob is intelligent enough to even do that. These projectiles would be unguided and not likely land anywhere suitable to consume or reproduce. 

Update with Math The formula for orbital period when the masses of both planets need to be accounted for is as follows: $$ T = 2\pi \sqrt{a^3 \over {G(M_1 + M_2)}} $$ where $a$ is the distance between the two planets and $M_1$ and $M_2$ are their masses. For two spherical Earths orbiting just close enough that their atmospheres touch, this gives an orbital period of two hours and 49 minutes. If I fudge the masses in an attempt to emulate the planets being ellipsoids with a 2:1 aspect ratio and put 0.455 Earth radii between them (see below), I get an orbital period of 7 hours, 40 minutes. I think this is about the shortest orbital period you'll be able to get in a system like this, if the system is going to be stable. How did I get those numbers? The 2:1 aspect ratio and the 0.455 radii? Well. The Roche limit page details two different Roche limits: one for a rigid satellite, and one for a fluid satellite. The rigid limit is the orbital radius at which loosely-bound material on the satellite's surface (or planet's surface, in your case) will be lifted off and ejected into space. Soil, water, and air all count as "loosely-bound", as there's nothing beyond the gravity of the planet holding them down, so that's something to keep in mind. The fluid Roche limit accounts for how the tidal forces will distort the satellite and make it more vulnerable to being torn apart. It serves as a good upper bound on how close two bodies can orbit with no risk of being torn apart, although, in practice, many moons in our Solar System orbit well within their fluid Roche limits. They are, in part, held together by tensile forces. They're made of ice or rock, not water. However, I'm fairly sure that none of those moons have atmospheres or any of the fluid-like inner workings that allow Earth's plate tectonics and other geological activity to function. If you want Earth-like planets, you'll need to adhere to this limit more strictly. The formula for a fluid Roche limit on that Wikipedia page that takes the most things into account (and also happens to give the largest upper bound for where the planets will begin to break apart) is this: $$ d = 2.455R \root 3 \of {\rho_M \over \rho_m} $$ where $R$ is the long-axis radius of one of the planets, and $\rho_M$ and $\rho_m$ are their densities. I'm not certain which planet $R$ is supposed to be the radius of, but if the Rocheworld planets are the same size, it shouldn't matter. This tells us that the distance between the planets' centers of mass can be no less than 2.455 times their long-axis radii without risking the planets losing their atmospheres or breaking up entirely. This means that, if the planets are in a stable orbit, there will be at least 0.455 long-axis radii between them. If they're roughly Earth-sized, that'll be about 3000 kilometers. There's not going to be any appreciable atmosphere between them at all, much less enough to fly a plane from one to the other. It is also worth pointing out that a fluid satellite (or an Earth-like, geologically active Rocheworld) under these conditions on the verge of breaking up will have a 1:1.95 ratio between its long and short axes. If the tidal forces stretch the planet out any more, they will exceed the gravitational forces holding the planet together, and cause it to disintegrate. So your planets should not be any more elongated than that. Also note that if the planets are elongated that much, there will be almost no gravity at their ends. You may need to keep them a bit farther apart and a bit less oblong, just to keep their atmospheres in check. 

Genetic control The first matter to deal with is to ask what level of genetic modification is possible. If we are limited by standards slightly more advanced than today's, then we have a few options. We can.. Reduce or remove the production of certain catecholamines, deflating some riot situations. Reduce or remove the production of serotonin, causing memory loss. (What was i angry about?) Modifying the image of a "perfect being." More specifically, giving a genetic bias towards a certain leader figure. Studies have shown that completely irrelevant genetic traits have contributed to public image. So what if the perfect match happens to be the current ship captain. Kind of genetic There is the ability to genetically hamper the supply of insulin to artificially administer diabetes. This could very quickly nip rebellions in the bud if the only insulin supplies are located at secure nodes. In the same way, albeit somewhat less cruel, get everyone on a certain drug and watch as rebellions struggle through withdrawal before crawling back in surrender. (Never mind, just as cruel) Other Rather than using genetics (a recipe for some resistant hero to arrive), use neuroscience. As soon as someone gives birth, transport the newborn to a government approved "educational" site, guaranteed to improve IQ by looks in PR folder 20%. What is actually happening is basic conditioning. While curbing any rebellious thoughts for the next 2-3 years, the young will be fed direct associations between rebellion and pain, and conversely be given compliance and reward. As an added bonus, anyone audacious enough to not put their newborn through this liberating process will have the child labeled as being in possession of a lower intelligence. 

Well, I regularly sleep twelve hours when I've been sleep-deprived for a few days and then don't have to get up the next morning (i.e. on a weekend). So if your unconscious person has only gotten a few hours of sleep per night over the last few days, and then finally got a chance to rest freely, they could easily be out well into the afternoon, if they went to sleep early in the morning. In order for someone to be sufficiently sleep-deprived for this to work, something will need to wake them up a few hours after they go to bed for several days in a row. My alarm clock has done a pretty good job of that in my personal experience; if that doesn't work in your setting, maybe your dude is being chased by some very noisy bad guys? You ask about how exhaustion, dehydration, hunger, and blood loss might affect this situation. I'll be honest; I don't know. That's well outside my area of expertise. However, I'd imagine that any of those factors would only decrease the amount of sleep deprivation needed for it to happen.
