I personally prefer to thank them, reiterate my contact info, and indicate the response I hope for in the last paragraph, e.g.: 

I am a developer with 7 years of experience. I switched technology stacks recently, from mostly .NET to mostly Open Source, and am also picking up Git and JIRA. I can assure you that they really are challenging to learn, especially when you have a new job and are learning lots of other things. At Microsoft and many other companies, the new employee experience in software is referred to as "drinking from the firehose" - because there is just too much to learn, and you absolutely will be overwhelmed. Keep at it. Be empathetic about how you are disrupting people's normal workflows, apologize and try to use the least disruptive way to ask questions that time will permit (email or IM if you can, or visit people in person around lunchtime, when they get in, or when they leave so you don't disrupt them when they're in the middle of their workflow) - but don't stop asking questions and disrupting them. It's part of your job to learn, and you can't do that if you don't get help. Really. Feeling like you aren't up to the job is normal for software developers. Many new devs experience something called "impostor syndrome" - the feeling that you are less competent than others and need to hide your incompetence. If you feel that way - fight it. You are competent (probably), you are just also new. This is normal. It's just a feeling. Months 3 and 4 on a new software job tend to be the hardest, especially in terms of self-esteem, according to the charts Microsoft showed us during their new employee on-boarding process about five years ago. This is because of the frustration of feeling like you should be contributing while still being in the process of ramping up. Give it at least 6 months, and I'd recommend giving it a full year before you assume it's the job and move on to a new job. If you aren't happy after two years, you should definitely move on - that's more than long enough (at least in the software industry). I'd recommend giving your career at least 3 or 4 jobs before you switch careers. There are a lot of great tips here in the highly rated responses. I just wanted to give some perspective to go along with that advice. I am going to give one tip that I don't see here: Record your experiences, especially the parts that are painful. What information did you want that was hard to find? What training did you need, and what worked for you? What learning resources are you discovering? You can pass this information on to your manager and other new hires, build out the team's documentation, and maybe even offer the information to help HR improve their on-boarding process. Turn this painful experience into a career opportunity. This isn't necessary, but will probably earn you some big kudos if done gently. This is an opportunity you will have every time you start a new job - so watch for it in the future as well. 

I think that this is nice, but a little overthinking. A 0.5â‚¬ coffee isn't that much, even for a small bunch of coworkers. As you seem concerned by this, why wouldn't you, once in a while, bring some nice pastries for the team, and say: Hi guys, you always pay for the coffee, very nice of you, it's my time to take care of you. Here's some sweets for all of us, let's enjoy our break! This would cost you very little money, not more that a round of drinks. It's nice, and shows that you're willing to thank them, and be as nice to them as they've been nice to you. Or just buy a key, put some small amount on it, use it, and give anything left when you move. And you're done. Nothing more, nothing less, no big deal... 

(1) I wore a white long-sleeves underneath a white TS, and black underneath black; women also kept some of their clothes underneath the TS; we never had a problem. 

It can be legal to requiere that employees regularly maintained hair colour (if an individual colours her hair), with no visible roots. (NOTE: to keep this as small as I can, I won't quote all the interesting parts, but you may either read it, or CTRL + F "hair" will do the job...). 

I would not throw in my manager's face an out-of-the-blue plain NO. I'd rather explain why it could be better to do it another way. For instance: 

The signs you put in the bathroom are commonly useless for the ones who know and already take care of their personal hygiene, and helpful (and not helpless, typo corrected thanks to @Brandin) for the ones who don't care and/or don't know. In order to create awareness for the ones who don't know, it's always useful to show them the benefits of doing something. As a simple search (that you already did) can give many information (e.g. diseases spread not washing hands, I think you could let people know what they face. Before you set up a meeting, you can send an email, sharing data about the diseases than can be spread. Or just say nothing, call for the meeting, and explain. But it's important that people understand that the company does that not to bother them or to "educate" them, but to protect everyone's health, including the company (less people calling off, better the rate of return, greater benefits for eveybody). Then, when everybody knows, put the signs. As a nice reminder. Don't put the blame on anyone, show them why it's good for them, AND everyone around them, and they will be more willing to listen to you. Create awareness for the ones who don't know.
