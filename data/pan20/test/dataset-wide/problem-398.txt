No Wikipedia has an entry on Pulsar Planets. This entry indicates that only four confirmed pulsar planets have been found and a fifth is a candidate. These planets seemed to have formed from three different mechanisms. These planet formation mechanisms are: PSR_B1257+12's Planets Condensed from supernova debris 

This is very very easy. Someone in the comments was close to the answer but didn't quite get it. The pathogen needs to have the following characteristics: 

Some physiological aspects of humans are controlled by one or few genes (say eye color). Other aspects (like height) might be controlled by 100s or 1000s of genes. Some scientists think that human intelligence may be controlled by 10,000 genes. Each of them contributing a small amount to a person's over all intelligence. We have not yet identified all of these genes and what side effects the "smart" version of the gene might induce. The article I referenced above suggests that if we switched all of these genes to their "smart" setting, we might engineer a human with a 1000 IQ (100$ \sigma $ above average - genius IQ being about 4$ \sigma $ above average). The steps required to perform this engineering are: 

We can do it now We could in theory do that now. The problem isn't one of capability, it is cost and time. Solar Focus Mission Solar Focus Point: 

Kinda Sorta The Earth's magnetic field periodically switches polarity (the N-S poles flip location). We can see the record of these transitions in the rocks of the Earth (especially the oceanic crust spreading from oceanic ridges). 

Of similar animals living in similar environments which display these traits, the ones with the above traits score higher in intelligence (EQ) ratings. 

But the reference didn't say how long that would have to be. I'll try to found out required exposure duration later but I have to go to some meetings :) Mechanism of death by phosphoric acid exposure This is the reference for the following quote: 

Find the distance from each town to every other town. Take the town whose shortest distance to another is the largest in the group - designate this as town 1. Select its shortest route to the next town -designate this town 2. From town 2 select the route to the closest unvisited town. Repeat step 4 as necessary 

Not the digestive tract but pretty close. Fungus Growing in the Body Another close match is fungal pneumonia (which I have). It is an example of fungus growing in a living animal's lungs. You inhale the spores and they take up residence, germinate, and begin growing. My fungal pneumonia - example of fungus growing in living animals 

If the chemical escapes its container, it will spontaneously ignite with everything it comes in contact with and there is no way to stop the reaction. 

So getting rid of garbage would seem as easy as extending a cable with the garbage on the end until tidal forces are sufficient to pull them away from the habitat. Unfortunately, you and that garbage will return to the same orbit at the same time every full orbit. Ultimately, you'll need to provide that garbage with some ability to change its orbit. Thought experiment: try to get rid of garbage using tidal forces and a parachute 

Per unit mass, fat has the more than twice the energy of the other two (carbohydrates, protein, and fats). Fats contain 9 cal / g. A dietary calorie = 1 scientific kcalorie. A mango normally weighs about 500 g but let's say the fruit we wish to use is twice that (1000 g). The most energy you can put in your fruit is $ 1000 gram \times \frac{9 calorie}{gram} = 9000 calories $. In this case, it'd simply be a massive lump of lard. Our bodies preferentially burn carbohydrates for energy and require proteins for cellular construction, so you'll want to dilute your fruit with these other components. The bar must also contain the micronutrients essential for the healing, probably in proportion to our regular needs for vitamins and minerals but at increased amounts. All in all, you probably need a fruit composed of all the things we normally need in our diet and approximately in the same proportions as our diet requires. If you weight it a little heavy with fat, then you'd get something like: 

Background Science fiction is rife with "super materials". Most often the materials are made from elements unknown to Current Era (CE) science. They use names that make us think of elements without being real elements. Some examples of these are 

If you have an atmosphere with a high quantity of oxidizers (like on Earth), then reducing gases (like methane) added to the atmosphere don't last long. They react quickly and are flushed out. So really your atmosphere can only contain inert (like $N_2$) & oxidizers, like Earth or inert (like $He$) and reducers (like $H_2$ & $CH_4$), like Jupiter. Fluid Dynamics Fluids (liquids and gases are both considered fluids) tend to mix. There are two primary mechanisms for this: 

Over short periods of time, your population's genetic diversity can only decrease. Diversity for this population can only increase by the introduction of new gene alleles (usually due to mutation). To gain diversity, you need to do one of the following: 

There are many proteins that transport oxygen in the terrestrial biosphere, this, and this. One thing to note is that at human body temperature, atmospheric pressure, and Earth's atmospheric concentration of oxygen Hemoglobin is by far the most efficient oxygen transport protein among the list included in this post. It varies from 50% more efficient to 10x more efficient than the other oxygen transport molecules listed here. 

The Forces To elaborate on the previous answer, Spinward & antispinward components will be subject to mild compressive and tensile forces. Pipe and wire connectors should be sufficient to hold members in place and provide for "pedestrian" & elevator traffic. Inward & outward These forces will be bigger than the other forces. The equation that governs this force is the tidal force calculation. $$ F = m\Delta rG\frac{M}{R^3} $$ F - Force on the body away from it's center of mass m - Mass of the smaller body $ \Delta r $ - Distance between center of mass of the small body to its edge G - Gravitational constant M - Mass of the larger body (e.g. star) R - Distance between center of mass of the two bodies Components will be subject to mild tensile forces. Wire only connectors should be sufficient to hold members in place and provide for "pedestrian" & elevator traffic. Northward & southward Components will be subject to mild compressive forces. Pipe and wire connectors will be necessary (pipes for the compressive forces, wires for stability). and of course you should read the book Integral Trees for more information about life in a "smoke ring". Answering the Question 

I think it is believable to have an avian type species that use a combination of beaks, tongues, and talons to perform the manipulation that they require. Just remember, having been born that way they won't know there's any better way to do things. I also think the brains are more important than the quality of their graspers - but maybe that's just me. 

Let me address a couple of matters of terminology first. (Unless you need a manned mission or have other factors which impose timing constraints) distance doesn't matter. It is $\Delta V$ (change in velocity) times the mass that needs to move that constrains the mission. To find the most economical method to move things around, consider the total amount of $\Delta V$ required to accomplish each goal. How much $m_{equipment} \times \Delta V$ must go out? How much $m_{asteroid} \times \Delta V$ must come back? Add the two sums together for the total mission budget. To minimize program costs, you want to minimize the total mission budget. Mine in situ or bring it back? If you need lots of equipment to accomplish your mission objectives (e.g. you require a manned habitat and must keep it supplied) you may want to bring the asteroid back to minimize this cost. Alternatively, if you want the entire mass of the asteroid brought back (e.g. to form the core of a manned habitat), then you will need to return the entire asteroid's mass. Otherwise, you will probably want to mine it in place. If time doesn't matter, you can reduce $\Delta V$ If you're just shipping raw materials around, then you can save significant amounts by using the Interplanetary Transportation Network 

By the 18th century our ancestors knew the shape to be an oblate spheroid within about 1/300th ($\frac{\Delta r}{r}$): 

You will arrange for the small asteroid to begin a very long series of alternate flybys between Jupiter and a large asteroid. On one end of the orbit, the asteroid flyby will transfer some momentum between the small asteroid and the large one. On the other end of the orbit, the asteroid flyby will transfer some momentum between the small asteroid and Jupiter. Each of these flybys will mimic a purely elastic momentum transfer ($m_{asteroid} \cdot \Delta v_{asteroid} = m_J \cdot \Delta v_J$ collision, but the net result is that you are transferring momentum between the target and Jupiter by way of your small asteroid.
