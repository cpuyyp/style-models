When we analyze an earlier time period, we have to take care to also study it from their own perspective, taking into account all the socioeconomic factors and all the constraints of the level of technology they had back then, and its effects on daily life. Judging them solely from a modern, (or even utopistic) viewpoint only leads to finding them either bizarre or evil, just like how they would view us if they didn't understood all the context which made our current civilization look like it is. 

Many participants in Rákóczi's War of Independence. If you include "rebels" in the definition (one side's traitor is another side's freedom fighter), the officers who sided with the independence movement were defecting from their positions as officers in the imperial army. The reason for this was that Hungary was formerly split between the Ottoman Empire and the Habsburg Empire, the remainder forming a mostly independent Principality of Transylvania. After the end of the Great Turkish War, all of the above three territories ended up under the control of the Habsburg Empire. Francis II Rákóczi, prince of Transylvania, rebelled against the emperor and wanted to liberate all of Hungary from Habsburg control. Obviously, most of the military under his command fought previously in the Ottoman wars under the Habsburg banner. As the war dragged on for 8 years, the Habsburgs offered many rebel generals their old positions and lands back if they switched back to their side. Some accepted, most notably Ocskay László. He fits the question the most, because he betrayed the emperor to join the rebels, and then betrayed the rebels to join the emperor again. Interestingly, after a series of failures in the emperor's employement, he was captured and was ready to betray the emperor again, but this time the rebels didn't believe him and, executed him. Another interesting example is Károlyi Sándor, another former imperial commander who joined the independence movement. Near the end of the war, Rákóczi gave him command over all the military with the order to continue fighting, but after evaluating the situation, he has seen more fit to arrange for a very forgiving peace treaty instead. After the war ended peacefully with the treaty of Szatmár, the rebels were granted full amnesty, and many military officers resumed their duties in the emperor's army. 

After receiving the letter, Roosevelt decided that the letter required action, and authorized the creation of the Advisory Committee on Uranium. This committee initially funded small scale Szilárd and Fermi's nuclear experiments but later on became an all-out bomb development program called the Manhattan Project. Leó Szilárd and Eugene Wigner both of them who drafted the letter studied in Berlin for a brief period of time but fled as soon as Hitler rose to power. In other words, the Nazis gained control of an academic system poised for unlocking the secrets of the atom, poised for developing the atomic bomb. But hatred of Jews prevented Hitler from allowing this situation to follow its natural trajectory 

Mussolini's fall Followed by these failed invasions, Mussolini ambitiously suggested Hitler to help them in Operation Barbarossa. Mussolini thought it might bring back Italy's luster. The heavy losses suffered by the Italians on the Eastern Front, where service was extremely unpopular owing to the widespread view that this was not Italy's fight, did much to damage Mussolini's prestige with the Italian people. The Allied invasion of Sicily brought the war to the nation's very doorstep. The Italian home front was also in bad shape as the Allied bombings were taking their toll. Factories all over Italy were brought to a virtual standstill due to a lack of raw materials, as well as coal and oil. Additionally, there was a chronic shortage of food. Mussolini's false propaganda was also revealed and the public relied on international papers and radios to get their news. Within a few days of the Allied landings on Sicily, Mussolini's army was on the brink of collapse. This led Hitler to summon Mussolini, by this time, Mussolini was so shaken from stress that he could no longer stand Hitler's boasting. Shortly after, King Victor Emmanuel III, ordered Mussolini's arrest. 

Mussolini's view Mussolini had a false belief that demography had something to do with nation's powers. Seeing declining birth rates in France and Britain having one quarter of his population above 50, Mussolini believed that these empires were doomed to fall. Mussolini saw international relations as a struggle between "virile" nations with high birth rates that were destined to destroy "effete" nations with low birth rates. By this logic he saw alignment with Germany would be far more beneficial compared to Britain or France. Mussolini ideology was that of an imperial expansion of Italy. Initially skeptic of joining with Germany but as France fell quickly at German attack, Mussolini was convinced that war would be short and Germany would emerge as winner. Italian troops would be sent into battle - indeed, to their deaths - not in the hope of military gains, but entirely so that Mussolini could sit down next to Hitler at the peace table when the fate of a defeated France was being decided. Italian Army was not all enthusiastic about this policy and morale was low among the soldiers. Mussolini, on the other hand, believed - or professed to believe - that the Italian fighting forces were first rate. Despite the morale being down, Italian Royal Army (Regio Esercito) remained comparatively depleted and weak at the commencement of the war. Italian tanks were of poor quality and date back to World War I. To add to this disaster, there was equipment shortage. All this inadequacies were hidden from general public and Mussolini projected Italy as a great power along the ranks of Britain and Germany but it wasn't so. Failed invasions As Italy invaded France, the unprepared Italian forces, which outnumbered the French defenders by nearly 4-1, suffered over 1200 killed or missing in return for only 37 French soldiers killed. They managed to penetrate at most 4000 metres over the French border, before France surrendered to Germany. Feeling humiliated, Mussolini settled for a narrow demilitarised zone in France. Next Mussolini eyed British controlled Egypt. He aimed to gain control over Suez Canal to dominate the Mediterranean. For invasion, Mussolini called in troops stationed in Libya, there were about 200,000 men. On the other hand, Britain had only 30,000 men including reinforcements from India and New Zealand. Despite having strength in numbers, Italian Army was defeated by British Forces. Main cause for the defeat was Italy old war strategies which they applied in World War II. But they forgot that this was modern warfare. Next was the Italy invasion of Greece. This was a perfect example of Mussolini's arrogance and opportunism. The initial Italian offensive was quickly contained, and the invasion soon ended in an embarrassing stalemate. Greek were able to launch a counter-offensive that drove the Italians back into Albania. 

There are a number of factors: As noted in the question, spreading out would make you less likely to be hit BUT it would also make it less likely that you would hit the enemy. Battles would take much longer, would tend to be less decisive and potentially end up as hand-to-hand engagements when both sides ran out of musket & cannon balls. Even with muskets, many battles hinged on a bayonet charge into the enemy, where the mass of soldiers is as big a part of the 'impact' as the sharp, pointy thing on the end of the gun barrel. So keeping the men together as a unit allowed a concentration of firepower at musket range and a heavier impact in the charge. Another factor is control. Most of the soldiers in these armies were not professionals. Keeping them going in the right direction (when they really want to be going in the opposite one) is far easier if they are marching together in ranks rather than spread out across the field. It also made identifying units easier for the commanders of the army so that orders could be given to the correct subordinates to get those units to the right place. 

According to Samuel Johnson's "A Dictionary of the English Language" (6th Edition, 1785), there were two meanings of the word. 

I'd say, from the partial emblem on the front, that the aircraft was part of the USAF 322d Airlift Division (Combat Cargo) in 1962-3. According to this article the "[322 Air Division] sent a squadron of C-130 Hercules to India just after the end of the 1962 hostilities with China". To give credit where it's due, @TomMcW & @Gerry on the Aviation board got the right aircraft. It was assigned to the 40th Airlift Squadron which was part of the 332d AD. The 40th AS, sent 12 C130s to New Delhi, India to aid the Indian armed forces, where they served for a year. 

Since the base unit of time is now defined as the second (minutes, hours and days, etc are all derived from it). The "current 24-hour day cycle" would have been defined as recently as 1997 when the S.I. definition of the second was last changed..
