And your androids would have had to have that software, or they would have been stuck with literally every human who approached them with a different voice pattern. Conclusion Since your androids already have the ability to associate new sound patterns with existing references to come up with the correct meaning, all they need is time. With every deteriorated word they successfully map to the original language they begin to see patterns in language drift (which is what they were programmed to accomodate anyway). And not too long after that they're speaking Portu-Greek with the best of them! BTW, humans still have trouble with voice recognition, just to make a point. 

Occured in Michigan rather than Washington ... which it could easily have done. Michigan has the resouces to have made that happen. The only thing missing was the people — and when people happen where is very capricious. 

Can those moons, share a single, complex, horseshoe orbit? Perhaps not as many as you describe, but the situation is plausible. Saturn's moons Janus and Epimetheus share a horseshoe orbit. However, you will need to invoke some of the magic you describe. Earthlike moons means a massive planet, one that cannot be Earthlike because you require the high gravity to keep Earthlike moons in orbit. So, without the magic, you would be forced to give up the habitability of the planet. 

and a host of other systems all "detecting" how "upright" we are (based on the brain's "I want to do this" control). The result is muscle changes that put us in the position we want (e.g., "upright"). So, first and foremost you need to think abut how your target insect would evolve those basic systems (don't worry to much about the details, you're looking for "good enough" so readers can suspend their disbelief... not so PhD's can nod their heads in agreement that you correctly predicted a million years of evolution). Goal: how would the insect create it's internal "gyroscope?" If it still has its exoskeleton, then it will need to compensate for the loss of touch (but, for example, it may compensate by developing the ability to detect minute stress against joint muscles). Delicate Muscle Control Without electronic help, we really can't detect the bazillion of muscule corrections that occur moment-by-moment to keep us in the position we want (well, when you're standing on your toes trying to screw in a lightbulb with the tips of your fingers you can tell...). However, those adjustments are needed. The basic problem with insects is that most of those limbs have very little in the way of muscles (or whatever squishy goo they use to create basic contractions). They may evolve muscles/squishy-goo such that they can, but that means... Swiveling Joints Here's the next problem. Balance requires the bendy parts to adjust in a lot of different directions. If you think about it, your toes, ankles, knees, hips, spine, and shoulders must all make minute adjustments to keep you upright. Nearly everything on those darn bugs is ramrod ridged. Now, exoskeletons means no internal bones. That's OK (...ish) if we evolve really tough "skin" that can better articulate the joints and allow for greater range (and more subtle range) of movement. Perhaps your biggest challenge here will be side-to-side corrections. Imagine (probably because I saw the picture in another post) a grasshopper standing up. The ability of its legs to "rotate" forward (and, with evolution, backward) covers half the problem, but the basic design means very limited side-to-side correction. If you pushed on his "shoulder," he might just fall over because he can't do anything about it. Without an internal bone structure for hips, our friend might need a short but tough "tube" that extends from the abdomen to the leg, giving it a bit more separation from the body and therefore greater side-to-side range of motion. The "Other Side" Muscles Another thing your bugs will need is muscles on the "other side" of the "bone." Humans have muscles, for example, on the front and back of the leg. Those muscles work together to keep you upright. They also allow you to move both backwards and frontwards. Insects can kinda do this (beetles and spiders better than most, grasshoppers would suck at it) because the legs tend to be engineered for just one or two motions. However, if we think of the "squishy goo" as hydraulics, then everything you need is basically already there: you just need a better pumping system that can precisely forward and reverse the fluid, so to speak. Goals: joints and "muscles" (aka, hydraulics, I kinda like that idea). 

And we're missing a means of redressing wrongs, also known as "checks and balances" ... call it a judiciary Nowhere in your described system does an individual have the ability to bring a complaint against the ruling council. Remember what I said about organizations basically reducing people to line items on a balance sheet? Judiciaries are, in a very generalized way, the means of ensuring that doesn't happen to the detriment of society. Somehow, you need a system that permits people to express the idea, "but that's not fair."1 I could go on, but writing a book isn't what you need. They've already been written. You might be putting the cart ahead of the horse, which is a common behavior for young authors. You might have created your government before you created (or came to understand) your colony. A ruling council works well with a small organization, where the vast majority of people fit neatly into the organizations represented on the council. Those same people are all professionals, predisposed to work together to achieve a clearly stated goal. But after you've added a bunch of babies to that mix, and those babies have become teens — bored teens — suddenly you have a bunch of people who don't fit the mold, and the "clearly stated goal" suddenly doesn't apply anymore becuase it isn't their goal. Nor will it be the goal for the bazillions of jobs that spring up to support a couple of generations of bored teenagers. So, would your ruling council work? For a small enough colony, yes. For a large colony (frankly, anything bigger than 50,000 guaranteed), you need an actual government. To paraphrase another famous document, "that this [colony] shall have a new birth of freedom—and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish." [source] 

Scientifically, this can't be done. "Floating" is nothing more than density of object A being less than the density of object B. Hot air balloons float because the density of air inside the balloon is so much lower than the air outside the balloon it can lift its own weight and a bit more. Therefore, your gas would need to be more dense than the rocks. At that density, whether a gas or not, you could walk on it (and, to answer your side question, boats would work just fine... assuming they could move through something more dense than rocks....). It's possible to address the question as rocks filled with an offsetting gas (e.g., helium), but it would have to be very little rock to a lot of helium due to that "their own weight and a little more" statement I made about hot air balloons. Look at how much hot air is required to lift a nylon bag. Now pretend that bag was as dense as rock. Therefore, let's assume your planet has a type of rock that forms thin, difficult-to-break shells as they rise through magma, trapping gas inside. In real life, that gas is never helium, but let's stretch reality for a moment and say that it is. Your floating islands would be fairly large, paper thin (though difficult to break) and almost entirely made of this material. Let's say it shimmers like glass. It would look cool. But this is as close to science as you can get (and there's not much science here). 

The question is tagged hard-science. I'm going to ignore that tag completely. I think it was bad advice to add it. Here's why: 

Curiously, this applies to our situation. If our recovering peoples don't need it, it's not valuable for them to obtain it. Methane cometh from pig... Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome kindof sensationalized the idea that if you get enough pigs together in an enclosed space you can electrify a small town. Well... kinda... You see, the left side of the equation is relatively simple. Boil a lot of water and use the steam to turn a crankshaft. It's the right side of the equation that's the real bounder. Electrical generators, transformers, switches, motors, blah, blah, blah. And where do you get new light bulbs, Max, anyway? Huh? Basically, if you have the technology to electrify the town there are probably easier ways to generate the power than drilling in landfills for methane. However, if the technological balance works (frankly, it won't, but if it does...) then deep landfills in warm, damp areas (think southern costal) will generate methane almost forever. But if people are basically back to hunter-gather with houses (i.e., up to the 1500's or like pioneers, seperated from society), then they'll never go to the effort to sink a well for methane, they'll just burn cow dung and wood unless all that other stuff is a very limited resource. People are very practical. If there's an easier way to do it, most people will do it that way. You need to force people to do things the hard way. I want to say just one word to you—just one word... Plastics! The real issue is what is practical to mine. With no research and no better knowledge than what I can find scratching my left ear, my guess is that the single biggest resource in any landfill is plastic. Plastic is indispensible to us today, but to a pioneer-style community? It's primary value would likely be sheeting for structures and basic implements like eating/cooking utensiles. Maybe arrows (at least shafts). Almost anything you can do with wood you can do with plastic — assuming it's not simpler to get the wood. Practicality will be a big factor here. Plastic is easy to burn and once it burns, it's useless. If your post-apocalyptic pioneers have easy access to anything that substitutes for mining the landfill, they'll avoid the landfill. So, other than the obvious metals, what else is there? Old sofas and worn out electronics have little value. But, according to here, there is only one other useful thing: 

And all the supporting technology needed to keep this ball of wax from melting including construction & manufacturing. That might be a bit of trouble keeping hiden, but what are dungeons really for, anyway?
