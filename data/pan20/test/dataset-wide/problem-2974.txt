My initial answer was I: we do not know the truth value of G or ¬E, because per the following definition, ¬E means that not every line of E's truth table is false (= ≥ 1 line is true). 

I do not feel prepared yet to tackle Kant; so I do not know if this allegory in 1 originates from Kant or the author Dr Warburton.

While desultorily browsing on Amazon.com, I chanced upon the following how-to guides from publisher Granta UK on famous philosophers and writers; so I haven't read them myself but thought to tender them anyways. If anyone has read them, please feel free to advise and evaluate. I can't find a list on Granta UK's website that neatly lists and catalogues each book in the series, but I tried their search engine which's defective because at the bottom, it shows links to 10 pages of search results (10 records), but when I click on any other page, I receive a page error warning. Anyhow, Amazon.com does exemplify their offerings a little more, such as the following (I don't replicate everything): How to Read Hume How to Read Plato How to Read Wittgenstein (How to Read) 

In the context of philosophy (and not writing), how does 'descriptive' differ from 'analytic'? I can't spot any distinction from the overhead quotes, which ostensibly uses them both to signify 'critical, explanatory, and value-free assess- ments'.

Because the antecedent of P2 is positive, but P3 and P4 are negations, the key idea is seemingly to apply modus tollens to P2: 5. ¬(Y or Z) ⟹ ¬(W and X). Then apply DeMorgan's Law to distribute the negator (ie ¬): 6. ¬Y and ¬Z ⟹ ¬W or ¬X. Now what must be done? Please explain and show all steps and thought processes. 

I know little Ancient Greek; so maybe the problem resides in the translations (so I cited 2). How is the bold true? It appears too categorical, because something inequitable can be LAWful (though immoral), as proven by Sachs's grey sentence in the footnote. Did Aristotle err in using a Universal Quantifier (everything)? Should he have modified is (with an adverb like 'sometimes')? 

[10.1] All but/except X are Y.    => No X are Y, and all non-X are Y. I see that, and so ask not about how, the SFCP for 8 differ from the SFCP for 10. Instead, what are the subtler differences between 'exclusive' from 'exceptive' (synonyms in ordinary English)? I am confused how the OS for 8 and 10 produce different SFCP. To me, the Function Morphemes in 8 and 10 both appear to exclude and except. For example, in 8, 'only' and 'none but/except' select a subset (from a set) about which the proposition then asserts something; but 'all but/except' in 10 does this too! So what subtleties did I overlook? 

Per 1, why is not Taylor's position above really some middle position between the boosters and knockers?

Though seeing 'somehow in line' in [2], I do not understand [4]. What is difficult? I exemplify with 3. The adjective 'fine' is unclear; so suppose that we ask that person and then know her definition of fine (eg: 24°C = 75.2°F, 55% relative humidity, clear skies, etc...) and her aims (or functions) (eg: canoeing in a wildlife area). Then how is 4 true? 

I understand the last sentence's meaning: Locke is spurning rote learning and received wisdom. But what does the emboldened verb phrase intend to say? It feels like a metaphor. 

Inexperienced in the natural sciences, I do not understand the bolded. Suppose that as one equation, Boyle's Law (hereafter BL) is regarded as one independent assumption. Then any reference or use of BL means BL assumed true. So how does a mechanism reduce 'the number of independent assumptions we need to make'? 

My challenge of 1 means my misunderstanding of it: Why is 1 true? Please see this question's title. Suppose that you despise the notion of, and so wish to imagine your absence at, your own funeral. Then you can cease thinking about anything resembling your funeral as follows, for example: As soon as you imagine a funeral home, church, or crematorium or cemetery chapel, you can stop yourself by thinking instead of anything joyous (like the kind people here at Philosophy SE). Does the above disprove 1?

HT should describe 'the phenomenon it is supposed to explain' : What is wrong about this? All HT are benefited by AHM that improve a hypothesis. So How can AHM make a HT self-supporting? The question of AHM differs from the question of testing, because independent of (the number of) AHMs, any modified hypothesis must still be tested. 

The assertion♦ that Critical Thinking (hereafter CT) includes, but does not equal, Logic, implies the insufficiency of Logic to teach CT. I plan to read textbooks in both CT and Logic that increase in difficulty as I progress. But am I correct that all textbooks on CT are introductory (example)? If so, then how do I progress in CT? With what books? What does the absence of textbooks on CT at higher levels imply? ♦ per 1, Dr. Bob Zunjic and Bertrand Russell (see the last paragraph here): '[...] it is important to recall that Russell does NOT equate critical thinking with logical proficiency.' 

Then how is 1 an Appeal to Pity (abbreviated to AtP)? Is not 1 a Valid Syllogism as follows? 3 differs from the Protasis of 4, and so 4 and 5 would not apply. 

What is the intuition behind the bolded assertion? Please do not answer with formal proofs or arguments. My drawing of Venn Diagrams for examples of syllogisms confirms the assertion above, but I still cannot intuit this in general. For example, the assertion above needs me to choose the circle that is all shaded except for one area in the following Venn Diagram. Unshaded in 1, 2, and 3, the S circle is shaded the least. Unshaded in 1 and 2, the R circle is shaded less. Unshaded only in 1, the C is shaded the most. So C is the critical term. QED.

I accept that 2 is the correct, and 3 is the incorrect, translation of 1; but I wish to dig deeper: What are the steps and thought processes behind translating 3 (the generalisation of 1) into 4 (the generalisation of 2)? Can a Venn Diagram depict why only 4 is correct, and 5 is incorrect? 

Here is my more realistic example: Observation of a beauteous waterfall presupposes organisation by time and space; by time because the observer must think of time as increasing to observe (the beauty of) the falling water (otherwise, she will not see the water as falling); by space because she must be standing away (at a safe distance) to observe.

I know little of philosophy and nothing of football, but does the bold allege the preceding question (that I surrounded with lozenges: ♦) as a Strawman Fallacy (the basics of which I read)? How? This scandal concerns Brady; so Brady is a subject. What's the straw man?

Please explain the bolded: What is metaphysical about asymmetry? From reading these few paragraphs (from The Big Questions: Philosophy, by Simon Blackburn), here is my conjecture of the meaning of [1]: Only God can accesses the 'view from nowhen', which resembles a movie film that can be unrolled infinitely and that already depicts our past and future as already having been decided. In contrast, humans see only the past and not the future.

I see that 1 attacks Kony's actions and 3 Shakespeare's scarce education; so 1 and 3 attacks no argument whatsoever. But I do not comprehend the importance of this distinction between attacking someone and attacking this person's arguments, for the status of AAH as a fallacy. If AAH is NOT fallacious when used to attack someone, then why does it become fallacious when used to attack this same person's arguments?

I seek only intuition; so please do not answer with formal proofs or arguments. The bolded sentence does not convince me. The only affirmative Categorical Propositions are A (in which only the Subject is distributed) and I (in which neither the Subject nor Predicate is distributed). So for any Affirmative Proposition, at least one term is not distributed and we know nothing about this one term. Then how is the bolded true? How can you assert something about a term about which you know nothing? 

Please correct me if my paraphase is wrong: In 1, the author explains that his detractor err in attacking him based on the (perceived) immorality of his clients and the alleged need for a criminal defense lawyer to justify his reasons for defending controversial clients. In 2, Tigar then rebuts the detractors by clarifying the reason for his defense of controversial clients: his . But why is attacking 2 erroneous, because trying to understand how to live life does not defend bad behaviour? Tigar may be genuinely trying to understand how to live life, but his trying may cause grave problems? 

I already understand, and so ask NOT about, refutation of the above by parallel reasoning (Prof Neta does this following the quote above, in the video). Instead, without appealing to refutation by parallel reasoning. please explain what's wrong with the above? I tried to depict the above, but my sketch below only supports the fallacy. Where are the problems?

Per 1, I already know how DS can be proven more quickly with (Indirect/Short-Cut) Truth Tables; so a deduction (which would take longer) is needless. But in general, for Valid Arguments, are Deductions fallible? For Sentential Logic, are (Indirect/Short-Cut) Truth Tables the only 100% safe method? Consider the following. Because 4 is the the Principle of Explosion, anything can be deduced in 5: so what if you instead wrote (wrongly) ¬Q (instead of the correct Q)? Then the Deduction would continue and conclude with ¬Q, but dangerously and deceptively, would fail to reveal this error?
