The post below is jointly by Rainer Dietmann and Christian Elsholtz. We had worked on the problem since a while and had an independent asymptotic solution to Euler's problem. Our argument is possibly easier, but in it's current form it does does not achieve the correct order of magnitude of the number of solutions. This seems to be a very nice feature of Lucia's approach! We had intended to make the argument entirely explicit in order to prove the statement for all $n$, not only for sufficienly large $n$. (See also the comments after the second argument below). We also had intended to prepare these results for publication. Lucia, we would appreciate if you could contact us by email, the email adresses (RD in Royal Holloway and CE in Graz) are easy to find. $\textbf{Theorem:}$ Let $n$ be a sufficiently large positive integer with $n \equiv 2 \pmod 4$. Then $n$ can be written as the sum of two positive integers, none of them having any prime factor $p$ with $p \equiv 3 \pmod 4$. This asymptotically answers a question of Euler. Important partial results are due to R.D. James (TAMS 43 (1938), 296--302) who proved the ternary case and an approximation to the binary case. Indeed the ternary case allows for an elementary proof, based on Gaus' theorem on the sum of three triangular numbers: Any integer $k$ can be written as $k = \frac{x(x-1)}{2}+ \frac{y(y-1)}{2} + \frac{z(z-1)}{2}$ and therefore $$ 4k + 3 = (x^2 + (x - 1)^2) + (y^2 + (y - 1)^2) + (z^2 + (z - 1)^2).$$ Observe that $ (x^2 + (x - 1)^2)$ is a sum of two adjacent squares, and thus cannot be divisible by any prime $ p = 3 \mod 4$. (Recall here and for later reference the following $\textbf{Fact:}$ if $p|n = s^2 +t^2$, with $p = 3 \mod 4$ prime, then $p|s$ and $p|t$.) Using a well known result of the late George Greaves, one gets a short proof of the Theorem. $\textbf{Proof.}$ By a result of Greaves (Acta Arith 29 (1976), 257--274), each sufficiently large positive integer $n$ with $n \equiv 2 \pmod 4$ can be written in the form $$ n = p^2+q^2+x^2+y^2 $$ for rational primes $p, q$ and integers $x, y$, and the number of such representations is at least of order of magnitude $n (\log n)^{-5/2}$. We write $a=p^2+x^2$ and $b=q^2+y^2$ and take multiplicities into account: namely the number of representations $r_2(a)$ of $a$ as a sum of two squares is $r_2(a) \leq d(a)\ll a^{\varepsilon}\ll n^{\varepsilon}$. The same holds for $r_2(b)$. We therefore find that there are at least $$ n^{1-2\varepsilon} $$ many tuples $(a, b)$ with positive integers $a, b$, such that $n=a+b$ and both $a$ and $b$ are the sum of the square of a prime and the square of an integer. Now suppose that $w$ is a prime with $w \equiv 3 \pmod 4$ and $w$ divides $a=p^2+x^2$, say. Then by the `fact' above and as $p$ is prime this implies that $p=w$ and $x$ is divisible by $w$. Therefore, at most $O(1+n^{1/2}/w)$ many $a$ can be divisible by $w$, and for any such $a$ there will be only one corresponding $b$ since $a+b=n$. The same argument applies if $w$ divides $b$. Moreover, clearly $w$ can be at most $n^{1/2}$. Summing over all such $w$ we conclude that the number of tuples $(a,b)$ with $a+b=n$ and $a, b$ of the form above, where one of $a$ and $b$ is divisible by any prime congruent $3 \mod 4$, is at most $O(n^{1/2} \log \log n)$, which is of smaller order of magnitude than the expression $n^{1-2\varepsilon}$ above. This finishes the proof. $\textbf{Remark.}$ It seems likely that the number of representations $f(n)$ can be greatly improved by observing that one only needs $r_2(a)$ on average. This should produce $f(n)$ within a logarithmic factor. Moreover it seems possible to adapt Greaves's argument by replacing $p^2$ and $q^2$ by squares of integers not containing a prime $3\bmod 4$, achieving a further logarithmic saving. (Let us briefly reflect why the argument works: Greaves uses the fact that Iwaniec's half dimensional sieve can also handle sums of two squares. The contribution from the almost trivial 'fact' is also quite useful.) Let us briefly sketch another possible approach, which could be more suitable for getting a result for all positive integers: Let $f(n)$ denote the number of representations as a sum of two integers, both not containing any prime factor $3 \bmod 4$. Let $r_{(a,b,c,d)}(n)$ denote the number of representations as sum $ax^2+by^2+cz^2+dt^2$. We intend to show that $$n^\varepsilon r(n) \gg r_{(1,1,1,1)}(n)- 2 \sum_{p=3 \bmod 4} r_{(1,1,p^2,p^2)}(n) \gg r_{(1,1,1,1)}(n).$$ Observe that $r_{(1,1,p^2,p^2)}(n)\approx \frac{1}{p^2}r_{(1,1,1,1)} $ and that $\sum_{p =3\mod 4} \frac{1}{p^2}$ is a small and finite number. For a completely explicit result all we need is an explicit lower bound on $r_{(1,1,1,1)}(n)$, which can be derived from Jacobi's formula, and an explicit upper bound on expressions like $r_{(1,1,p^2,p^2)}(n)$, which can be obtained either by the circle method using a Kloosterman refinement, a modular forms approach, or via Dirichlet's hyperbola method. The big question then is if the resulting numerical bounds allow the remaining finitely many cases to be checked by a computer. 

I have been looking for a couple of days for the answer to this question to no avail. Let me define what $\Sigma$-injective is. 

The skew-field of quaternions $\mathbb H$ is isomorphic to its opposite algebra. Indeed, by a theorem of Frobenius, division algebras over the reals are isomorphic to either $\mathbb R, \mathbb C$ or $\mathbb H$. Since $\mathbb H^\mathsf{opp}$ is again a division algebra, it must be isomorphic to one of these. There are several ways to conclude: since it is four dimensional, or since it is not commutative, or since it has more than two square roots of $-1$, etc., we conclude that the only possibility is $\mathbb H \cong \mathbb H^\mathsf{opp}$. If you are only interested in Morita equivalence between these two algebras, you can do better: the Brauer group of $\mathbb R$ is isomorphic to $\mathbb Z_2$, and so all elements are of order $2$. This implies that the class of $\mathbb H$ coincides with its inverse, which is the class of $\mathbb H^{\mathsf{opp}}$. Thus $\mathbb H$ and $\mathbb H^\mathsf{opp}$ are Morita equivalent. 

These "obvious morphism" come from the following setup: By 2 we may replace $R^\bullet$ with a bounded complex $I^\bullet$ such that each $I^i$ is injective as left and right $A$-module (but not necessarily as bimodule). Thus for every complex of left $A$-modules $M^\bullet$ there is a map, defined at the level of chain complexes \begin{align*} M^\bullet \to Hom_{A^\circ}(Hom_A(M^\bullet, I^\bullet), I^\bullet) \end{align*} given by simple evaluation. Passing to the derived category, the complex on the r.h.s. is isomorphic to $\mathcal R Hom_{A^\circ}(\mathcal R Hom_{A}(M^\bullet, R^\bullet), R^\bullet)$. Putting $M^\bullet = A$ gives us the morphism of point 3 of the above definition (if $M^\bullet$ is a complex of bimodules then the map respects this structure), and in the paper Yekutieli proves that this map is an isomorphism for $A$ if and only if it is an isomorphism whenever $M^\bullet$ is a bounded complex with finitely generated cohomology modules. So far, so good. Dualizing complexes, when they exists, are not unique. In order to fix a special class of isomorphisms Yekutieli introduces local cohomology. Set $\Gamma_m(-) = \varinjlim Hom_A(A/A_{\geq n},-)$, where $A_{\geq n}$ denotes the ideal of elements of $A$ of degree at least $n$. This is a left exact functor, with a right derived functor $\mathcal R \Gamma_m$ defined over left bounded complexes of left $A$-modules. Then he states that there is a map similar to that above, \begin{align*} \mathcal R \Gamma_m(M^\bullet) \to \mathcal R Hom_{A^\circ}(\mathcal R Hom_{A}(M^\bullet, R^\bullet), \mathcal R \Gamma_m(R^\bullet)) \end{align*} It is this map I am trying to make sense of. By looking at it simply at the level of complexes, we might feel tempted to replace $M^\bullet$ by an injective resolution $J^\bullet$, reuse our old resolution of $R^\bullet$ called $I^\bullet$, and thus obtain a map \begin{align*} \Gamma_m(J^\bullet) \to Hom_{A^\circ}(Hom_{A}(J^\bullet, I^\bullet), \mathcal \Gamma_m(I^\bullet)) \end{align*} given again by evaluation. This is indeed well-defined, but the problem is that passing to the derived category, it is not immediate, at least to me, that the complex on the r.h.s. is isomorphic to $\mathcal R Hom_{A^\circ}(\mathcal R Hom_{A}(M^\bullet, R^\bullet), \mathcal R \Gamma_m(R^\bullet))$. In order for that to happen, $\Gamma_m(I^\bullet)$ should consist of $A$-module which are injective as right $A$-modules, and I see no reason for that to be true (in the article it is proven that these modules are injective as left $A$-modules). Any ideas on how to fix this? Have I made a mistake with the definition of this last morphism? 

I have a field $L$ and two field automorphisms $f, g: L \to L$ such that $f \circ g = g \circ f$. Under what conditions can they be extended to automorphisms of an extension $K \mid L$ that still commute? In particular they can certainly be extended to automorphisms of the algebraic clousure $K = \overline L$, but can they be extended to a pair of commuting automorphisms? 

Another perspective of the question is from the point of view of computational complexity. According to the this paper ($URL$ for a simply connected finite simplicial complex $X$, computing $\pi_n (X)$ is a computationally very hard problem with respect to the parameter $n$ ($W[1]$-hard to be concrete). It has been known for a long time that higher homotopy groups are algorithmically computable (the first results go back to Brown), and later it was shown ($URL$ that there is an algorithm which for a finite simply connected simplicial complex $X$ and $n \geq 2$ computes $\pi_n (X)$ in time, polynomial in the size of $X$. However, in this polynomial result $n$ is taken as part of the input. The result I stated above is that if you vary $n$, then the complexity of the problem explodes. I find this point of view particularly nice because it gives some concrete feeling for how complicated the computation of higher homotopy groups is (including the homotopy groups of spheres). On the other hand, one may point out that many results have been obtained regardless of the complexity but the sophistication of the tools required to obtain those results is yet another instance of this complexity. Hope that is useful. 

First, $\pi_{4k-1}(S^{2k})$ has an infinite cyclic direct summand for every $k \geq 1$. As a simple example, you can think of $\pi_3(S^2) \cong \mathbb{Z}$, coming from the Hopf fibration. We recently wrote a paper where we solved a problem, which is closely related to your question. Namely, we give an algorithm which for a given finite simply connected simplicial complex $Y$, and a given $d \geq 2$, under some technical conditions on $Y$ the algorithm outputs for every generator $\alpha \in \pi_d(Y)$, a simplicial map $f_\alpha : \Sigma^d_\alpha \rightarrow Y $, where $\Sigma^d_\alpha$ is a simplicial complex whose geometric realisation is homeomorphic to $S^d$. In particular this works for spheres. You can find the paper on archive ($URL$ and it will soon appear in the SODA 2018 proceedings. The complexity of the algorithm is singly exponential on the number of simplices of $Y$, and we show that this is optimal. The way we prove it is by constructing an example $X$ where the necessary size of the spheres $\Sigma^n_\alpha$ is exponential on the size of $X$. That shows that any general algorithm must necessarily have at least singly exponential complexity. However, we do not work with barycentric subdivisions, but with a rather specific and non-canonical (if I might put it so) triangulations of the $d$-sphere. The construction of those was invented by Clemens Berger in his PhD dissertation ($URL$ - in French only). We believe that one could be able to fit those "non-canonical" models into an iterated barycentric subdivision of the boundary of a standard simplex. If this is true, it would mean that you need to subdivide $\partial \Delta[m+1]$ enough times to fit the exponentially large spheres produced by our algorithm, and you would be able to represent any homotopy element you wish. On the other hand, even though our algorithm is exponential in the general case, it might happen that it runs in polynomial time for some very specific spaces. For example. It is not impossible that this turn out to be true for spheres, but I cannot say much more about it. There is also another point of view. Spheres are compact Riemannian manifolds and you can rephrase your question in the language of Lipschitz constants. In this language, your question roughly translates to "what Lipschitz constants can one expect from representatives of homotopy groups of spheres". There is a connection between the Lipschitz constant of a Lipschitz function and the fineness of a triangulation required to homotope it to a simplicial map. This is somewhat expected because both notions measure some sort of geometric complexity of the function in mind. In particular, there is the following result by Gromov ($URL$ Theorem (Gromov): Let $X$ and $Y$ be compact simply connected Riemannian manifolds. Then $$\# \{ [f] \in [X,Y] \, : \, Lip(f) \leq L \} = O(L^\alpha)$$, where $\alpha$ depends only on the rational homotopy type of $X$ and $Y$. You can check also this ($URL$ paper from Weinberger and Ferry. There is a long study of similar questions from that point of view. I hope my comments are useful. In conclusion I would like to say that you question is very deep and very hard.
