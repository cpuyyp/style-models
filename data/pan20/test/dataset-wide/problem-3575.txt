Yeah so, you obviously need to eat more. If I understand you correctly you fast for 24 hours per day, which in itself is fine, however it is VERY hard to get one day worth of food in one meal. Especially vegetarian meal. So you need at least one more meal per day, maybe even two more to get into caloric surplus. Think of it this way. To maintain your current weight you need to eat around 1200-1300 kcal/day, you would probably want to be around 1800kcal/day to start adding weight. I would guess you currently eat well below 1200kcal per day. So if you take you current portion size and just eat that amount once more every day you will at least hold your weight and probably gain some. If you are still not adding weight after a couple of weeks, add one more meal. On a pure plantbased vegan diet I would recommend you start stocking up on beans, lentils and nuts since it is full of protein and is fairly energy dense. Include that in you every meal. Prepare food to eat the next day at the same time you eat your dinner, then just bring that with you to college. Make a plan with times when you are going to eat your meals and be punctual with your meal time. You will feel stuffed the first couple of weeks, but make sure to eat your meals even if you have to divide it into smaller portions. If you keep to your new meal plan and eat at the same time every day, after a couple of weeks you will get hungry at that time and eating your meals will be easier. With a lowered immune system I would not recommend you start exercising right now, it will just make you ill. So start with fixing your energy intake. Then after a while you might want to take up some weight training to gain some muscles. You should also concider going to a doctor, not only for a check up on your overall health but also so a professional can determin if you need to be referred to a weight clinic or any other problems which can't be determined on a forum like this. 

Cortisol is actually released in a diurnal rhythm with a spike when you wake up, and tapering off during the day until the time you go to sleep where it is at its lowest. Cortisol levels are also proportional to the intensity of the training as well as length. Elevated cortisol levels is linked to protein synthesis. A widely cited report is this one, which states that protein synthesis was impaired by 5-20% with higher (the highest is really high) cortisol levels. Elevated cortisol levels is also linked to gluconeogenesis (the conversion of protein to glucose). So by that rational an elevated level cortisol can not only reduce tissue growth but also break down tissue, as in cushing's syndrome. 

Why not try a body recomposition program. A well defined six pack is well built muscles and a low fat percentage. A way to attain this is to eat 500kcal above maintenance levels on training days and 500kcal below maintenance on non training days, training each other day so that the net balance is zero over the week. To build the muscles you need to hit them with hypertrophy training. Cardio is detrimental towards that goal. It puts alot of stress on your body which really should be resting and building muscles. Try to eat somewhere around 1.5g protein per kg lean body mass, which also helps towards building muscles. As long as you hit your protein, the rest can be pasta, rice or whatever you like to eat which helps you keep the dietplan. As long as you are in a net equivalence, or in net deficit. This will, albeit slowly, gain you some muscles and lose fat leading towards a six pack. 

The best thing to do is to work on your maximum strength - by doing so will mean that your economy per rep when trying for your press ups is less. If you have access to a gym, incorporate a session or two a week to strength - this will be fewer repetitions (anywhere from 1-5) but with a weight that really makes you struggle. When a weight gets easier, increase the weight and continue. Look into the 5x5 or the 5-3-1 programs as they are simple yet very efective. Then, when you hit your max reps press ups, you'll smash it!

Regarding power, it can be split into 2 types - overcoming a small resistance (e.g. punch) or movements that require effort to be developed rapidly overcoming a large resistance (e.g Olympic lifting). The deadlift alone is a strength exercise - you could however undertake complex training with the idea here to perform a strength exercise, followed by a similar movement of an explosive variety. So for example, you could use a deadlift for 3-5 reps, followed by high pulls/sandbag clean/dummy suplex etc... Strength will be gained by lifting maximal loads - it looks like you already are using 5-3-1 or something similar, which is excellent - purely for max strength, cycling through these rep ranges will allow your body to maximise your strength when it comes to the last set, with the goal being to get more reps/ increase poundage lifted. Calories - by using just the deadlift? Why not try once a week giving yourself a 10-20 window with 60-70% 1RM and performing as many reps as possible (Escalated Density Training). The aim here is to beat the reps every workout - it jacks your heart rate up and creates a big metabolic burn helping you burn calories long after you finish. To make it even better, do a longer EDT window and choose multiple compound exercises! 

In terms of basic outline of your programming, it looks fairly sound. Strength is very easy to develop - although most people tend to not have the attention to work on it properly. Strength programs should be very simple and, as a beginner, you should look to increase poundage pretty much every session. You're correct to focus almost exclusively on compound lifts (working lots of muscles - especially those that have large direct effects on the rest of the body - squats and deadlifts). Programs to look at are the 5x5 and 5-3-1. Obviously make sure that you are comfortable with the technique of these lifts in particular, as done wrong (90% of the time) can result in injury, especially if you're working near to your max. The most important thing you have to do is progressively increase the weights you're lifting - if you're trying, your body will respond and you'll get stronger. I'd also mention that loaded carries serve as superb finishers - in the gym, the farmers walk is the simplest way to do this: grab 2 dumbells (aim for approximately 50% of your own BW in each hand if you can) and walk. That's it! Aim to get as far as you can in a time limit, or aim for a distance and record your time. Check out my blog for further information - $URL$ 

This could be due to shoulder stability - work your OH squats as much as you can, plus supplemental exercises like KB windmills and TGU will be of help as well. 

I agree with Robin, but i'd also add that if you have access to a Trap bar this would be even more beneficial for someone who is a little wary of their body. Because the weight is more centralised, there is much less impact on the lower back and the quads work more so than a conventional deadlift. 

I plan to do interval training for running a 5K. I also plan on doing back and abdominal exercises but slowly because of previous experiences: Chronic muscle pain Several years ago, I made serious progress in both losing weight and getting a 6 pack without changing my diet at all. But it all stopped when I started doing oblique exercises. My abdominals started hurting. Even several months after that, it still hurt. It took a year of no exercise for it to stop hurting at which point, I lost all my progress. Acute muscle Injury This was an experience I have had multiple times. When I don't exercise for a long time, my abs hurt like they were pulled a day after just 1 set of 12 reps. This goes away in a few days. But 1 time, it was different. I was doing 3 sets of 10. At first, it just felt like lactic acid. A day after, no difference. I only noticed something was wrong 2 days after I did 3 sets of 10, at which point, I stopped exercising completely. It got so bad that within a week, I could not do a single sit up. I really could not lift myself up using my abdominal muscles. Instead I had to turn and use my arms and legs to lift myself up. Luckily, this didn't lead to a hernia and the muscle healed just fine and within a week, I was back to normal. So I know not to go over 1 set of 10 the first week if I am doing abdominal exercises every day(which is what I was doing) and increase by a maximum of 1 set of 10 a week. I also only added another exercise after 3 weeks when I knew my muscles were adapted to a particular exercise. I plan to do something similar but instead of focusing just on my abdominals, I will focus just as much on my back to avoid that chronic muscle pain and I also plan to go slow to avoid pulling a muscle. So here is my plan for at least the first 3 weeks: Week 1: Every day: 1 set of 10 sit ups, 1 set of 10 abdominal stretches(but for the purpose of exercising my back) 3 days, with a day in between each one: Interval training for 5K Week 2: Every day: 2 sets of 10 sit ups, 2 sets of 10 abdominal stretches 3 days, with a day in between each one: Interval training for 5K Week 3: Every day: 3 sets of 10 sit ups, 3 sets of 10 abdominal stretches 3 days, with a day in between each one: Interval training for 5K I plan to lose weight and get a 6 pack as well as being able to run a 5K without my legs getting seriously sore(I walked a 5K once before I planned on training to run a 5K and even walking, my legs ended up so sore and the soreness lasted for a while) 

I have found a C25K plan that is 100% interval training with full runs only during the last few weeks. However, I donâ€™t just want to be able to run a 5k. I also want to eventually get 6 pack abs so I am exercising my abs and back(back is mainly for avoiding a muscle imbalance) starting at 1 set of 10 reps for both and adding exercises every 3 weeks. So, obviously, I will need protein but as far as the exercises, how should I integrate the 5K training with abs and back exercises? The 5K training is every other day for 3 days of the week. I have noticed me being able to do bodyweight exercises daily without soreness unless I go past 10 reps per day the first week, even just a couple reps past it like 12 will cause me to potentially pull my muscles so 1 set of 10 is the limit for the first week, 2 sets of 10 for the second week, and 3 sets of 10 for the third week. I will start my 5K training by running in place just to get the endurance for the time and then start using a treadmill to train myself for hills up to the maximum incline that my treadmill can get to(which I do believe is 30 degrees).
