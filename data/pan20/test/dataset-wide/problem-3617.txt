One or two time(s) a week a full body, full out (high intensity) workout will stimulate your muscles enough so they don't loose their size and strength. This is perfectly possible without a gym. You don't need fancy exercises, just one for every muscle group will keep your body perfectly in shape: Chest/Triceps/Shoulders: Push-up Back/Biceps: Pull-up Legs: Pistol Squats Core: The plank (leaning on elbows and those, body as a plank) But here's the trick: Muscle growth happens when you put your muscles under serious stress. You only need this stress response once, as long as it is intents. This will send a message to your brain that the muscles needs to get stronger. You have to make the workout short and intense, only four exercises and go full out. To give you an idea how short and 'full out': I'm usually done in 15 minutes. But you should not be able to get up for 30 minutes afterwards (breathing heavily). 

It is perfectly possible to grow stronger muscles by working out two times a week. Make sure you train every muscle group once a week (not more). Your muscles need time to rest. Keep your workouts under 30 minutes. To make that happen do the following: Two different exercises each only one set per muscle group. Don't rest more than 1.5 minute between sets. Make them burn! Go all out. You should be breathing heavily for 30 minutes after the workout. 

It's actually a very normal feeling. It's not even comparable to other purely psychological addictions(like internet), because physical activity induces a secretion of endorphines. If the activity is intense, and lifting heavy weights falls under that category, the amount released is proportionally higher. I have experienced the same feeling you described. I remember a few years ago I twisted my right ankle 2 times in one year - I had to quit sports for 6 weeks, and then build up gradually. I actually turned to alcohol to stop that nauseating and depressing feeling. I drank regularly much like an alcoholic, at least a liter of beer a day, often more than three (starting at lunch). When I recovered I stopped drinking as quick as I began. This of course add's up with the normal 'pull' to do the things we enjoy doing. It's a craving feeling, that can get so strong as to provoke debilitating symptoms during withdrawal. The entire concept of addiction is very complicated and equally interesting, the dilemma about when an activity or a substance (not just drugs but also chocolate, ice cream, sparkling water) is to be considered a negative addiction will probably never be solved. You have to evaluate if the activity has any negative impacts on your life. Sports doesn't really fall into that category, so I wouldn't worry too much about it. However you may have noticed that it's more difficult to maintain a social life outside work and the gym, because you spend so much time there. Also having a relationship might not be so easy. Fortunately in my experience the more sports I do, the less I feel the need to sleep. That really compensates for the time spent cycling or lifting weights. Of course, everything depends on you perspective on life. I am sure you'll even find doctors that can diagnose some psychological disorder just because you love working out to the extent where you feel bad without it. 

You get energy through a process in your body that's called metabolism. You have two kinds of metabolism: carbohydrate/sugar metabolism and fat metabolism. You can train your body (and you have genetical tendency towards one or the other) how well both those processes are functioning. Carbohydrate/sugar metabolism tends to give you fast and a lot of energy, but it also creates a sugar crash* after a period (about 2 to 3 hours). Fat metabolism takes a longer time to transform fat into energy but it is very consistent. This makes it ideal for activities that take longer than 2 hours. If you read journals from some people that did amazing performances such as running 1000 miles in 11 days (Stu Mittleman), you read that they only eat fats. Creating a well functioning fat metabolism might take a while, it will take your body some time to develop that part of the metabolism. It is worth the effort. I do not recommend you to only rely on fat metabolism because you do need carbs for a healthy functioning body. I advice you to eat fats (biological meat, fish and coconut/olive oil) until 18 hours for the race and carbs after. As a snack during the race: raisins and almonds are a good combination as well as banana's. I won't advise you to take energy bars to soon in the race but pack one just in case you feel very hungry in those last 10 miles. *Sugar crash means a sudden absence of sugar in your blood. This results in a tired feeling, mentally and physically. 

Physical withdrawal for the sense of well being that comes with natural endorphines. The intense craving for an activity simply because you enjoy it (this point is not to be underrated). 

My father used to run marathons in under 3 hours, so he can be considered a successful amateur runner. I remember the weeks before his races very well. He would eat a lot of carbohydrates and drink water all the time. Especially 2-3 days before the race he walked around the house with 1.5L bottles of water, taking a couple of sips every 15-20 minutes. Take care not to drink shortly before and after meals, and never too much in one go. Water absorption is physiologically limited and drinking more just flushes valuable nutrients from your system. He often mixed alcohol-free beer with the water, or added some broth. I personally suggest eating several bananas a day to stock up magnesium and stretching your legs frequently. Proper hydration, salt, magnesium, and stretching are the best preventive measures against cramps during prolonged physical activities. GL 

Your chest will feel like it explodes during step number 3 especially. Number 1 is a bit of rest, to catch your breath. After you get better reduce time of step number 1 and increase step 2 and 3. If you do it right you should stand in a pool of sweat after 45 minutes. When you find yourself wiping the floor where you did the push ups just to get some grip again you know the following things: 

Suddenly running out of energy (the kind you experience) is called a sugar crash. You eat high amounts of sugars (and some carbohydrates) before you go exercising so there is a lot of sugar in your blood. This blocks your body natural energy reserve system (your body fat). Your body will burn up all the energy in your blood and muscles while you are running and than it is out of energy (because the natural reserves are blocked). Try this: 1. eat more good fat's in general (fish, nuts, biological meat, coconut oil), this will give you energy without blocking your bodies energy reserve system. 2. eat carbohydrates (quinoa, wild rice and sweet potatoes) at least 1.5 hours before you go on a run. 3. avoid eating 1.5 hours before your run. The amount of sugar in your blood to disturb the human energy reserve system differs from person to person, thats why some people can handle a plate full of pasta for the race but some can't. If you got a chance, skip coffee before exercising. It will subtract water from your body just when you need it the most. 

Lowering your fat percentage (burning fat) can be a good goal, but you should be careful not to set unrealistic goals. Wanting a lower fat percentage than you are genetically designed to have can be very frustrating and unhealthy. For a man having a fat percentage between 6 and 15% is perfectly fine. It depends on you body type how much fat percentage you have. That said, let's assume that your fat percentage is higher than you're genetically designed to have. You want to burn some fat and build some muscle. Although loosing weight and building muscle are to different processes is your body you can do them at the same time. Burning fat is just using body fat as main energy source while being active and building muscle is just damaging your muscles (in a save way of course) so they come back stronger. To make your body burn body fat is it important that you lower the insulin level in your blood, you do that by cutting on the carbs and eliminating your sugar intake. To damage you muscle so they come back stronger you should put an intense amount of stress on your muscles for a short period of time. I recommend you to do three separate workouts in the gym every week no longer than 30 minutes, workout 1 is chest and triceps, workout 2 is back and biceps, workout 3 is legs and shoulders. I would do sit-ups as a warm up every workout. Make sure you push yourself to the lint every time, muscle grow happens in those lat few reps that seem impossible but you have to push them. But again: be careful, use your own judgement, and always ask the fitness instructor if you are executing an exercise in the right way. By doing this short/intense workout and avoiding sugars you will get your body to burn the body fat. You will needs some carbs but experiment with it, try one week more and one week less carbs and see what works for you. Always eat a lot of protein, healthy fats and vitamins. In loosing fat and gaining muscle diet is as least as important than the workout. 

Situation Due to a one sided sport I intensely practiced for a good portion of my teenage years(rowing in a team with only one oar per person), I have ever since experienced an awkward tight feeling in my hip when I stand up in the morning. After intense exercises I regularly feel a burn radiating down my leg on the outside of my thighs. I extreme cases and when it's very cold, I have a tingling sensation in my toes that makes me want to kick and stomp everything - the pain is really not a big deal, it is just so annoying! My very competent sports doctor diagnosed a piriformis syndrome. The radiating pain is caused by the muscle pressing on the Sciatic nerve. Unfortunately for me in addition to that, my entire gluteus is also extremely cramped up. My physiotherapist suggested puncturing the muscles with a needle that will causes the muscle to twitch and eventually relax. In my case the needles just bent.. this gives you and idea of how severely these muscles are cramped. The therapist said it is very unusual for these needles to bend, as they are quite thick. I searched all over the place for ways to help my muscles relax: massages, needle therapy, ultra wave therapy, stretches, no running, more running, more bicycle, Eventually I decided to take to extreme measures: at the local gym I used a machine to train external hip rotation with weights. I tried less weight and many reps until muscle failure/exhaustion, and I tried big weights with less reps, both slow and fast. I did this together with stretches and massages over 6 months now. It has become slightly better, but gluteus is still severely cramped, and in the meantime I have peaked on the weights (machine cannot do more than 110kg). I forgot to mention that I have no complaints whatsoever during activity, even under maximum loads. My questions: 

Heavy metals can significantly damage your health. Therefor I would discourage the use of protein shakes with high amount of heavy metals. Consequences of consuming high amounts of heavy metals (through taking protein shakes) can vary from difficult-to-pass bowel movements or concentration problems to prostate problems or even cancer (source: Mark Hyman, MD). That said, there is a time and a place for certain protein shakes. If your goal is muscle gain, you do need to consume a significant amount of proteins to (re)build your muscles. Eating high amount of poultry, meat or eggs for example can be bad for you as well. I suggest you find a protein shake that is extracted form vegan sources (so it's biological) and does not contain high amounts of heavy metals. Take the protein shakes for convince, if you have no time to prepare a meal for example. But never replace your meals with protein shakes. Protein is just one of the manny nutrients your body needs to build muscle (and stay alive for that matter). My favorite sources for protein are: Nuts, Seeds, Broccoli, Grass Fed Beef, Fish and Omega-3 Eggs. 

A mistake a lot of people make is that they assume that the human body is some kind of book keeper. That it counts the calories in and calories out and whats left is the energy you have. Unfortunately its not that easy. There are hundreds and hundreds of other variables that have influence on your energy or health in general. The biggest calorie burners are your digestion and your internal heating system to keep your body on the right temperature. But it's not about keeping track of the calories. Getting energy is about providing your body with the right nutrients (including water and oxygen) and supporting your body with eliminating the toxins. If we take a look at our bodies a bit closer you see that your body is build up from cells, those cells provide us with the energy we need (this process is called metabolism). Providing those cells with the chemicals they need and eliminating it's waist products will result in an increase in energy. Above all cells need oxygen and water, so take deep breaths and eat a lot of foods that contain water (vegetables and fruits). Besides that cells need vitamins and minerals, so make sure you eat a lot of vegetables and take some high quality supplements). And lastly cells need sugars (carbohydrates are converted into sugar) and 'good' fats. To answer your question, it is very important to listen to your body. If you feel tired you need to make some changes. There are a couple of things you can do. I listed the important ones below, starting with the one with the highest impact: Study yoga breathing techniques and learn to take deeper abdominal breaths Eat more water rich foods (at least 60% of your diet should be vegetables) Sleep more (ideally you want to wake up without an alarm clock most of the time) Exercise less or less intensive (walking is considered the healthiest form of exercise by many doctors) Take vitamin supplements and eat more omega-3 fats.
