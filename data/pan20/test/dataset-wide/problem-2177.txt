I'm not sure what to make of this situation. Over the years, my manager and I have developed a personal relationship at work. Aside from the regular communication of responsibilities, we joke with each other (and the rest of the team), talk about our lives, families, and other stuff. Thinking back at my previous year at work, I sometimes notice a look of discontent on my boss's face whenever I describe my solution to a given problem (happened once or twice). For the first couple of times, I asked if anything is wrong, and all I got was a "no, no, just keep going at it". Even if you look at my performance reviews, you can see that there are no criticisms there. And no, I highly doubt that this is the case of the oft cited Impostor Syndrome, because I'm often very well aware of what I can improve in my work. Not to mention that I feel that this might be an impediment to me improving at what I do, which is ultimately the most important part of my work experience. Because of this, I've become a little bit uneasy. I worry that our "closeness" (if you will) is getting in the way of him criticizing my work, even though I have repeatedly stated that I welcome this. I keep thinking to myself that next time will be the last straw, and that I will be fired out of the blue. Needless to say, I don't want this to happen, and I would like to honestly discuss this with my boss without being unnecessarily confrontational. So, my question is: should I resign? And if not, is there a way for me to bring it up with my boss in a professional way? 

It is difficult for me to articulate the benefits I've received by simply asking a senior developer for advice with regards to a specific aspect of my craft. More than just telling me the "correct way to do things," often times, they fill this essential gap that can't be filled by looking through tutorials or articles: that we don't know what we don't know, and how can we search for a feautere/language/technique/idiom/pattern to learn more about it when we don't know it exists or the problem it solves? Also, I found it particularly useful to learn how to be more pragmatic than theoretical at my job as a developer, and I enjoy it a lot more because of this. As a consequence of this, I consider it absolutely essential that I have a mentor (I'm still a junior dev) at any potential job I get in the near future, at least. How do I express to my potential employer that I am looking for mentorship from their more senior team members, without sounding like my skills are lacking or that I'm not independent? 

The bottom line is that it doesn't hurt to go inside and ask. Do keep in mind that you are making your first impression immediately, so be dressed and groomed appropriately for one of their retail associates. 

Most HR systems today use some form of Applicant Tracking System. Cover letters do not get processed in the same way as the resume/CV, so vital information that is only on the cover letter might not be used to qualify you for the position, or it might not be seen by the decision makers (it will be available to be seen, but that is not the same as being seen). As a candidate, you have to assume that the people initially reviewing your application have many resumes/CVs to get through in a short amount of time. If you make their job easier, you move the odds in your favor. If you make their job harder (by spreading important information across multiple documents instead of consolidating it into one - your CV) you lower your odds of getting through the process. So, to your question, if it is vital, put it in the CV and use the cover letter to call attention to it. 

Require that you leave and submit your resume and application online. Ask you to submit an application through an in-store kiosk. Ask you to take a test at an in-store kiosk. Based on your score, the store manager may talk to you. 

Will wearing a nice suit make or break you? Will perfect grammar? Will a well crafted, readable resume? Will [insert attribute here] make or break you. It's not likely that the decision to hire you or not will hinge on any single factor. You are evaluated on many different factors, some of them consciously, some are subconscious. A Thank You letter alone, no matter how well crafted, will not swing a hiring decision in your favor. But if the decision comes down to two candidates, of which you are one, it might be the nudge that edges the decision in your favor. 

It kinda depends on the scale of the company. 500k in sales at a huge company would be considerably less impressive than 200k in sales at a 3 person start up. There is also a difference in what is being sold. If it is a physical product, what is the profit margin? Is it something with little to no overhead? Honestly, if I saw numbers in a resume I wouldn't really think anything of it unless the numbers were considerably high -- in which case I would ask for clarification during the interview -- which will likely need to be done either way. I wouldn't put actual numbers in my resume for the reasons above. Without more context, they are meaningless. 

You've already asked him to explain why he did it that way. He gave you an answer that isn't acceptable to you, so rephrase the question -- "Why is it a good practice to write this type of test in this situation?", Tell him that relying on past tests is not an acceptable answer, and you would like to hear his reasoning on the matter. It is likely that his judgment is there, but explaining things is troublesome and annoying, so he just cited a past item as an excuse. You just need to force those answers out of him. If his judgment is indeed not strong enough, forcing him to explain himself each time will help develop that judgment. Let him know that this is to help him move up in the company (as he has come to you for advice, and you said you would support his promotion). If he is serious in his desire for advancement, he will go along with you. If he does not take these questions seriously, then he may not be the best option for advancement. 

There is only a need to put the school you graduated from and the date of graduation. GPA is optional, but the only relevant GPA is that at the time of graduation. I think that adding the other school and the GPA at that school would just be too much noise on the CV. The only exception perhaps being applying for a position at the first school. 

I'm like many programmers with young careers; I maintain a few pet projects that I use in order to improve my skills in both the domain I work in, as well as the craft of software development itself. Interestingly enough, I was having a discussion with some of my colleagues regarding one of my projects at a company event, and my boss was present as well. After a lengthy discussion, I was asked to bring it forward at the upcoming team meeting, because it could be a nice addition to the company's product line. I'm not sure how I should feel about this. On one hand, the code isn't of much use on my personal computer, and adding it to my company's arsenal would definitely make it a better product, by exposing it to our large team of talented engineers. But on the other hand, I don't want to lose ownership of this project; I work on it on my own pace, I use it to provide me direction on research on topics I'm interested in, and I've been working on it for over a year now. I suspect that some of the answers might come at me and warn me of the potential legal repercussions or conflict of interest issues that might arise with my employer. For the purposes of this question, please ignore this and assume everything is legal. So my question is: Is there an opportunity there, or should I simply bring it over to the next team meeting, and continue work as normal? 

We are a small team of software developers where everybody knows everybody, and we work in an open space. Naturally, this means that whenever we need to ask a question or get some information that is within the realm of someone else's expertise, we just walk up to them and ask. And this happens frequently, at least once a day. I can't speak for everyone else, but this usually knocks me out of my "flow". Ideally, I could just ask everyone to e-mail me whenever they need anything, but that might be seen as asking for special treatment, and I'm not sure how it will be taken. So, have you ever worked in such an environment? And if so, what are some of the techniques you have used to stay productive/in the zone? 

It sounds like you are wanting to submit your resume with hyperlinks, so as an electronic file rather than basic text. I applaud your creativity, but want to add a word of caution. For most companies, there is an applicant tracking system in place for dealing with resumes. As @jmac said, your resume will be scanned or parsed in some way to get it into their database. That way it can be searched, matched to jobs (that you didn't apply for), and easily passed from person to person for review. If your resume does not work within their system, they have to decide what to do with it: 1)somehow treat your resume differently than every other one that they process (and it is a process); or 2)they simply discard it because it doesn't fit. I'm afraid that in most cases that is what would happen. As to your actual question: I suggest that you include a shortened link to your git-hub profile (with a brief description/explanation that that is what the link is for). Then make sure that your profile has clear links to the projects that you want seen. With all that said, go ahead and make your interactive or hyper-linked resume. You my have one of those rare opportunities to personally hand it to a decision maker, and they may be impressed with it. But don't use it as your everyday resume that you submit to most job postings. (As a disclaimer, I work for a company that develops HR software, so I know how the process works in our system, and for core functionality, most applicant tracking systems are similar.) 

I would recommend that you apply again normally, just as you did for the first opening. If by chance you applied online, you may be able to log into your profile and submit it without re-entering all your information (but be sure to update any part of your resume or profile that warrants it). I was hired for my current job after applying for 2 previous openings (over the course of several months) but applied to each one individually. You were interviewed previously, so you obviously were under consideration. That you were not chosen doesn't necessarily mean that there is something wrong with you or your profile, just that they thought someone else was a better fit at that time. That other person is now out of the market, so perhaps you are the best fit this time. Focus on the positive. As to whether you should remind them that you interviewed previously, I would not do that in place of a regular application. Maybe include that in the cover letter or mention it if you receive a phone screen. 

I'll answer the question as it is asked. When I need to ask for help, I will usually go where I think I can get the answer the quickest. For example, if I don't know anyone, I will address either the manager or the whole department (such as the project channel in the company's slack) that is in charge of what I need information on. If someone answers me, I will continue going to said person as they have a history of answering me. If later someone adds on supplemental information that helped, I may go to that person instead when I need detailed information, but will continue going to go to the fast person when the detailed person cannot answer in a timely manner. If I don't have a means of asking the whole department at once, then I will stick with asking the manager for who can help me, and allow them to assign someone for me. If the manager isn't available, and I can physically go over to the desks of the department, I will either ask the most available looking person (by themselves, doesn't look like they are in too deep concentration, isn't wearing headphones), or just state my question in the general vicinity and allow someone to volunteer themselves to answer the question. I personally don't have a preference of the gender of the developer so long as I can get what I need in a timely manner, with the least amount of effort in asking from my part. I do not see gender as a factor of developer's competence. When asking questions, for me, it is mostly about getting a meaningful answer in a timely manner. 

I've never cared what domain the email address has when looking at the resume. If it is from a prestigious school, then they should have that affiliation already written on their resume. The email address itself isn't going to impress, I think. Same goes for the personalized domain. The exception here is if they bother to look at the site attached to the domain and it is impressive. Again, in this case, it can be listed elsewhere on the resume too, if it is impressive and the applicant has the primary role in the creation of said site. I personally see mobile email addresses / yahoo accounts / edu and gov accounts / personalized domains as the same, so I wouldn't spend too much time acquiring an email address that looks good, and just list the one that you could respond quickly with. With this said, meta data / signature should still be taken into consideration, and the non-domain part of the email address shouldn't be anything too embarrassing offensive.
