I do not practice boxing or martial arts, but I am a tennis player, and every coach will say the same about hitting the ball as a martial arts coach will about hitting an opponent - the power should come from your core and lower body, rather than your arm/shoulder. The idea is to use large muscle groups (quads, hamstrings, glutes, core) to create movement. These are the strongest muscles in your body, so they will allow you to hit with not only more power, but more stability as well. If all your power comes from your arm and shoulder, it will be easy for someone to deflect the hand or stop it altogether, as they will be fighting rather small and (relatively) weak muscles. The physical mechanism is simple - using your legs and core, you can force your upper body to rotate. If your body is rotating, then one shoulder is moving towards your opponent. Hold out your hand and use your arm/shoulder muscles to guide it as you rotate, and you will have a more powerful punch than if you kept your shoulders stationary and punched with your arm muscles. I do not have any training suggestions, other than practicing with this in mind. It helps to keep a slight bend in the knees so that your quads are already engaged. Your legs should be tired at the end of a practice session. As far as conditioning goes, I would suggest rotation exercises with a medicine ball (holding the ball in both hands, rotate it from one hip to the other). To step it up, do it on an upside-down bosu ball. 

Depends on what you mean by walking, really. I mean, these days it's uncommon for the fielding team not to appeal immediately at any whiff of a chance, however faint. Don't think I've ever seen a batsman walk without the fielding team at least thinking there might be a chance, and appealing. Seen them walk when the umpire gave a not-out, sure - Gilchrist's famous example was noted in another reply. However, it's not uncommon for batsmen to retire (hurt, for example). If that counts as walking without appeal, I guess technically I'd go with "yes" :) Note that a batsman cannot be given out without appeal (law changes re misbehavior notwithstanding), but an appeal is not required for a batsman to walk. 

Although the answer depends greatly on your skill, the volleyer's skill, and your respective positions on the court, conventional wisdom says topspin if you can hit it well. Topspin causes the ball to drop quickly (because, moving forward through the air, the friction between the spinning ball and the air creates high pressure above the ball and low pressure beneath it), so if you can hit a shot that will peak on your side of the net, it will hopefully fall near the volleyer's feet. Backspin shots tend to float in the air (high pressure below, low pressure above), so the volleyer is more likely to hit a shot at eye- or shoulder-level. In general, any volley contacted above the net is offensive, and any volley hit below the net is defensive, as the volleyer will have to pop the ball up. So a topspin ball that lands near a volleyer's feet is the hardest for him/her to play. 

The immediately adjacent pitches (the "square") can be used as spare pitches if the main pitch is deemed unplayable before the game. That's very rare, though, and I've never seen it happen; conditions which would render the chosen pitch unplayable almost always affect the entire ground. However, the pitches well offâ€‹ to the side are simply practice pitches. They're far too off-centre to be used for play. Teams want to get some practice on pitches as close to the match condition as possible, but using the main pitch would risk damage and is prohibited by law 17 on any day of a match. Edit to clarify: don't think I've ever seen a pitch swapped once handed over by the ground staff, but it's not uncommon for a club groundsman to change his mind about which pitch to prepare, if one has dried better than another, for eg. Not at professional level though; changing pitches is more complicated because of realigning the multitude of cameras and radar. 

Consistency. That is the most effective way to beat a player who is at a higher level than you, especially someone who doesn't have topspin or great form. Practice what my coach used to call your "rally ball." This is a topspin ball that should land around three-quarters court and should pass high (4-5 feet) over the net. If you are able to hit a ball like this consistently, you will suddenly find yourself beating players that play at higher levels. This shot is penetrating enough that your opponent will not be able to take advantage and hit offensive shots consistently, but it can extend a rally long enough for her to make an unforced error, give you a short ball, or get frustrated and go for an offensive shot from the baseline (which is very low percentage). Please not that I am NOT telling you to push the ball. The rally ball is not a weak lob; it is a driving shot with topspin that will force your opponent to stay behind the baseline where her hard, flat shots will often miss long. 

The run rate should always be calculated according to the actual number of overs involved. NRR will be calculated by number of overs batted (not how many were allocated at the start), RRR will be calculated by number of overs remaining (not how many would have been remaining if there were no reductions). This means too that if a team is bowled out in fewer overs than the innings allowed, the NRR will be calculated by how long they batted, not how long they could have batted. However, I'm sure it's possible to have a tournament with playing conditions which stipulate a different NRR calculation for statistical purposes. Can't really think why, but it's possible. You should check the tourname PQs to make sure there's no such clause. 

Racquet abuse is not the only offense that can lead to a point penalty in tennis. Kicking a bottle, throwing a bag, or using profanity will often lead to a warning from the chair umpire, if not a point penalty (depending on the number of offenses committed that match). These rules are in place to uphold the integrity and professionalism of the game and to ensure that players follow a certain code of conduct. They are analogous to technical fouls in basketball for yelling at a referee or throwing the ball. To an extent, they also serve to protect offender's opponent, onlookers, and any officials. Smashing or throwing a racquet can create a safety hazard for those in the area. In addition, tirades can quickly escalate. 

Did the same - took a lengthy break before getting back into club cricket in my 30s. A lot changes in 10 years! The length of your stride, your strength, your fitness...my advice would be, don't try to force your adult self into your youthful self's shoes. Trying to mimic the same run up is only going to frustrate you. What worked for me, was remembering the rhythm of delivery - how it felt when I bowled a good ball. Delivery stride, upper body position, arm movement, head position...that moment of delivery. Then, I went to the nets and experimented with different run ups until I felt, not the same, but similarly comfortable, at which point line and length came back quickly with practice. The key really being practice, though. Pound the nets until it comes back. Put markers on a good length and keep plugging at it until you can reliably put the ball where you want to, then build up the pace. And if you've lost a couple of yards of max pace, don't beat yourself up if it doesn't come back straight away or at all - work on variations instead. A surprising cutter mixed in now and then can be just as effective as a blistering yorker. If you end up with both in your bag, all the better! Good luck!
