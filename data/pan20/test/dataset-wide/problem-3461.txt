Speculation has a large role in the property market. There are many external factors which encourage such speculation. For example, zoning limits supply of available land very quickly. With good population growth forecasts, it is very easy to anticipate demand growth for land. 

In my experience, this one is a bit easier to read and does a better job of attempting to explain itself. It isn't as extensive as Greene. I would go to this book first because I find it more accessible. If I don't get the answer I need, it will probably be in Greene. 

Donohue & Levitt, 2001 showed a causal link between the abortion rate and the crime rate 20 years later. When abortion was legalized in the 1970s, a whole generation of unwanted births were averted, leading to a drop in crime nearly two decades later when this phantom generation would have come of age. 

I think there are some problems with the framing of your question. Some points... There are some assumptions that need to be added for a meaningful answer. 

As a group, there are similarities. They are all small and remote island economies. None have a population over 1 million people. Fiji is the largest with a population of roughly 900k. It is important to remember that they are still different countries and it can be unhelpful and misleading treating them all as identical. The Pacific island region has considerable potential for development, especially in the areas of tourism, fisheries, forestry, mining, and agriculture. Challenges 

I had a quick look and couldn't find any useful resources for you. I know Australia removed 1c and 2c coins from circulation and the USA has considered removing their 1c coins. It was found to be very very expensive. The other way around I can't imagine the economic costs would be too high. The main reason of changing relates to the preferences of consumers. 

If PPP holds, so does the LOP. The law of one price (LOP) is an economic concept which posits that "a good must sell for the same price in all locations". The law of one price constitutes the basis of the theory of purchasing power parity and is derived from the no arbitrage assumption. 

This is how you get from your first equation to your second. your utility function is $u(x_1, x_2)=x_1^a x_2^b$ since $a+b=1$ I'll change it slightly to a and (1-a) In order to optimise these two choices, you need to maximise utility, wrt your choice variables. subject to $p_1x_1 + p_2x_2 = w$ using Walras Law. Basically, in order to optimise utility, all money will be spent. Cobb-Douglas functions are typically difficult for optimisation problems. A monotonic transformation which preserves the ordinal properties of the function can be used. $aln(x_1) + (1 − a)ln(x_2)$ This will be used instead. The same budget constraint will be applied. The Lagrange and First Order Conditions are Below $L = aln(x_1) + (1 − a)ln(x_2) − \lambda(w − p_1x_1 − p_2x_2)$ $\frac{δL} {δx_1}= \frac{a} {x_1} − \lambda p_1 = 0$ $\frac {δL} {δx_2}=\frac{1 − a} {x_2} − \lambda p_2 = 0$ manipulating the First order conditions result in $\lambda = \frac{a} {x_1p_1}$ $\lambda =\frac{(1 − a)}{ x_2p_2}$ $\frac{a} {x_1p_1}=\frac{(1 − a)}{ x_2p_2}$ substituting in the budget constraint $p_2x_2 = w − p_1x_1$ $\frac{a}{ x_1p_1}=\frac{(1 − a)} {w − p_1x_1}$ $x_1 =\frac{wa}{ p_1}$ and $p_1x_1 = w − p_2x_2$ $\frac{a} {w − p_2x_2}=\frac{(1 − a)}{ p_2x_2}$ $w =\frac{a}{(1 − α)}p_2x_2 + p_2x_2$ $w(1 − a) = p_2x_2$ $x_2=\frac{w(1 − a)}{p_2}$ Using these results, we can work out the optimal consumption bundles of $x_1$ and $x_2$ for a given price, wealth combination. $x_1 =\frac{wa}{ p_1}$ $x_2=\frac{w(1 − a)}{p_2}$ 

This is a very interesting question a lot of good labour economists have been thinking about for a while. There are a few conflicting theories as to what will happen. You could base a whole career on this question. 

Without anything better than a CPI, a CPI would approximate it. That said, I don't think it would be accurate. A better gauge would be a measure of the cost of living for the effected people. Vehicle maintenance and the like would be much higher than a typical person. 

The basic idea behind scarcity and opportunity cost is fundamental to economics. Basically, if resources are infinite, you have everything. In my opinion, there are no infinite resources because a lifetime is finite. In one way or another, it can be argued all choices are necessitated by scarcity. Eating chips means at that time, you cant be eating a burger. That is your opportunity cost. This may be the point of your homework question, to make you realise that scarcity is a key driving force behind decision making. 

A more simple analysis would be to suggest that the firm is a monopolist operating with a profit function $F_1=\Pi^m(q)$ That is, $mc=0$ Price is a downward sloping function of Q $P=A-q$ The constraint is that $\Pi^m\geq 0$ and $\Pi^m(q)=(A-q)q-C$ which is price times quantity minus fixed cost. Looking at this simple model, an increase in the proportion of people evading fares, would result in a lower q. This essentially reduces the profit for the firm but does not impact supply. This could be adjusted to include a marginal cost in the profit function ($P=A-q-c$) 

The HOV theorem states that if a country is abundant in a factor, its factor content of trade in that factor should be positive, and negative otherwise. Empirically, this model is not that successful. Here is a good paper discussing the applications and results. See below for that extension: Vanek, Jaroslav, The Factor Proportions Theory: The N-Factor Case,” Kyklos, October 1968, 21, 749-755. 

The idea that revealed preference is preferable to stated preference is pretty common. It makes a lot of sense. That said, there is a lot of value in stated preference. It does offer something that RP does not. 

Thanks to densp for identifying this paper. It refers to a major pilot project undertaken in Namibia Background: The Basic Income Grant (BIG) pilot project took place in the Otjivero-Omitara area, about 100 kilometres east of Windhoek. All residents below the age of 60 years receive a Basic Income Grant of N$100 per person per month, without any conditions being attached. The grant is being given to every person registered as living there in July 2007, whatever their social and economic status. Before the pilot project, the area was characterised by unemployment, hunger and poverty. Conclusions: 

There should be very low immediate pressure on the standard of living. It gets more expensive to import into Australia, but Australian produced products are more competitive in the international marketplace. 

A fairly standard measure to use would be Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Over the past 30 years, US GDP has been growing at approximately 2.5%. According to trading economics 

This did not match my perception of the Australian economy at all. What similarities does the Australian economy have with the Saudi economy? Is the comparison fair? In particular, I am interested in structural issues the economies face. Secondly, is the quoted line accurate? My understanding was that the extraction cost for oil was very low in the gulf and the lower prices served to make other countries unprofitable before it cost them. 

Money can be seen as a store of value in your thought experiment and in reality. If you have many pebbles, you can choose to keep those pebbles where convenient in lieu of having other assets. Money is an asset where it can be readily be exchanged for other, more tangible assets. 

This question is heavily reliant on the context of when it was asked. A lot has happened since February with respect to the Australian Dollar. 

This devaluation has a few flow through consequences. Exporting to the US is cheaper. Importing from the US in particular is more expensive. A good way to think about it is if you are Australian and are thinking about travelling to the US for a holiday, you would be pretty upset. Your trip just got a lot more expensive very quickly. If you own a hotel and you cater to a lot of American tourists, you will be very happy. It will be cheaper for them to come. This change is good for our exporters, including natural resources, manufacturers and services. 

The prevailing opinion seems to be that increased automation is not going to come at a cost to employment. There are countless examples of advancement lowing the returns to labour occurring throughout history (the plough, the steam train, industrial revolution). None of them have shown a long run reduction in employment. The Solow Swan model for example, includes inputs to labour, capital and technology. They show technology and labour being complementary. Not much has happened empirically to suggest that this is no longer the case. 

In my opinion this analogy is intuitively very satisfying but I doubt it will show to be particularly useful. Possibly we will see fewer humans working the supermarket checkouts and more in entertainment in the same way horses are no longer our ploughs and our taxis but are more likely to be racing and performing. Past that I think the comparison is a pretty big logical leap. 

Looks to be the best source so far. Haven't read it all yet. When I do I will update here. It considers three basic income schemes and discusses the advantages and shortcomings. 

My question is, is there any empirical or other research on the impact of transition from a distortionary to a less distortionary tax which could be applied to the Australian case?
