The source of stories about Thales, marriage, children and sexuality is mainly Diogenes Laertius, Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers, given extra circulation in Plutarch's Lives. 

The form of argument, if this inference were valid, would be : If A then B Not-A Not-B However : If A then B (t) Not-A (t) could be true as indicated (t) yet Not-B false because : If C then B (t) C (t) B (t) is true consistently with Not-A. Take an example. If (A) it is raining (B) then the pavements are wet, it does not follow that if not-A (it is not raining) then not-B (the pavements are not wet). The pavements could be wet because of a broken drain (C). 

CONCLUSION Meiland offers at least a prima facie plausible and not run of the mill defence of the relativist against the charge of self-contradiction. I offer it as such. Of course it will not emerge unscathed, or possibly at all, from PSE critique. But such is the way of philosophy. REFERENCES Jack W.

Yes : Premise : All dogs are mortal (true) Premise : All birds are dogs (false) Conclusion : All birds are mortal (true) The argument is valid because there is a correct relation between premises and conclusion. This is not because the conclusion is actually true but, crucially, because granted the premises the conclusion must follow even though one of the premises is false. As noted in the answer above [Bram28], an argument itself is never said to be true or false : truth and falsity belong only to the premises and the conclusion. Arguments are only valid or invalid, depending on how premises and conclusion are related. If we cannot affirm the premises and consistently deny the conclusion, the argument is valid. 

In the case of equal evidence for and against a belief, I suggest the following considerations are relevant. 

There was a classic radio debate between Bertrand Russell and FC Copleston on the existence of God. I'm not sure if the full debate is online but here's about 20 minutes of it : $URL$ The debate took place many years ago but Russell is always worth listening to. 

A meaningful life is one that has a purpose and direction to it, one to which oneself attaches value, one in which one can trace coherent patterns in its past or project plans for the future. All these possibilities apply. The basic idea of meaningfulness here is the Sartean one of injecting meaning into one's - living authentically by values oneself has chosen. His least confusing statement of this view is given in the easily available, 'Existentialism is a Humanism'. There is plainly no requirement, if this is what a meaningful life is, for it to embody any particular values, least of all moral values and definitely not those of which ordinary moral thinking approves. From this viewpoint there is no paradox in a Gestapo officer's having a meaningful life but, judged from the standpoint of ordinary moral thinking, an immoral one. There is only a paradox if one steps outside existentialist thinking and sees the meaning of life as, say, a Catholic does : life has an inbuilt purpose which is to love and serve God, and to love and serve others (Matt 22:36, Mark 12:29, Luke 10:25). I offer no adjudication between these two very different views. (Not so different, however, but that some have not sought to formulate a Christian existentialism but I set that aside as involving too many issues.) On a Catholic approach there would be a contradiction in living as a Gestapo officer does and living in accordance with God's inbuilt purpose for humankind. But the perspective of existentialism removes the contradiction - of course relative to existentialist assumptions. 

This is an interesting if somewhat baffling question. A theist believes that there is a God. If a theist has no insight whatever into the personality of God, on what basis can s/he assume that God is responsible for all, any, half or none of the events in the universe ? God might be totally inactive - like the gods of Epicurus - and so (except by non-action) not responsible for any events let alone at least half of them. (Question : how does one individuate an event, so as to count events?) Not sure that a theist can coherently have (or believe that they have) absolutely no insight into God's personality. If they can then God = X, an unknown. I think a theist must believe that God has some attribute - whether it's perfection, unchangeableness, omnipotence, all-goodness, omniscience. Something, surely, must be believed about the nature of God if God has any meaningful role in our language. Only on this ground can the degree or level of God's responsibility for events be assessed, let alone calculated. I use the term 'responsible' but I'm not rephrasing your meaning. For purposes of this answer, if God is responsible for X then X is the work of God. 

Let's assume for the sake of argument a belief/ desire model of action explanation. Beliefs and desires combine to form intentions that lead to action in the typical case. Suppose I am a smoker : I want (desire) a pack of cigarettes and believe that the shop across the road sells cigarettes. I intend to buy a pack, cross the road and make my purchase accordingly. Much of our intentional action is conducted at just this level. But now, suppose I hear about or start to take seriously the health risks of smoking. I still have my desire to smoke; that's part of a habit I can't discard easily. But I can now have a desire not to have the desire to smoke. I want to smoke but, reflecting on my desire to smoke, I want to get rid of that desire or to control it in some way. This is a desire about a desire; a desire that has for its object another desire. It's reasonably illuminating to call the desire about a desire a 'second-order' desire. It doesn't, unlike a first-order desire such as the desire to smoke, immediately control my intentional actions. But it 'sits above' that first-order desire and is a desire to block or control it. We could call it a 'meta-desire'; Dennett calls it second order. Clear ? Or do you need further explanation ? If so, just ask. [Note : I am aware that intentional action is often greatly more complex than I have depicted the desire to smoke and the intentions that result from it. I am deliberately simplifying in order to make the first-order, second-order distinction easier to grasp.] 

Revived Neanderthals would be unlikely to be able to interact with the present human population, and so would need almost certainly to be geographically confined if not even more restricted in their movements. It is also hard to see how we could recreate the environment to which in their prime they were adjusted. We could treat them with respect but any existing environment or environment created for them would almost certainly be more or less alien and deprive them of a life of full flourishing. In this respect they are different from, say, the Dodo, which could readily adjust to a range of existing environments including probably the one in which they were eliminated in the 17th century. 

I can't find a specific reference in the Ethics, Politics or Generation of Animals. However there is in the view Aristotle takes of contemplation (theoria) in Nicomachean Ethics, X.7 an indirect argument for virginity or at least (if 'virginity' is objected to as an ahistorical term) non-experience of sexual intercourse or coitus and hence abstinence from procreation. Penetrative sex that does not or cannot lead to procreation (as in cases of infertility) is not a topic Aristotle deals with distinctly. I omit same-sex relations since they did not in Aristotle's time involve abstinence from procreation; procreation was not then posssible within them. We need to work up to this point about the link between contemplation and the abstinence from procreation. In Nicomachean Ethics I.1 Aristotle tells us that human well-being or flourishing consists in activity : activity in accordance with virtue (arete). This means activity in accordance with the various excellences of which we are capable as a species. Prime among these excellences is intellectual contemplation. Theoria is the best activity of which we are capable. Unfortunately because we are not just intellects but have other, bodily needs, theoria can never be our sole activity. (That is reserved for God.) The practicable human good, eudaimonia, is intellectual contemplation plus excellence in the other activities in which we have to engage. However, we need to be untrammelled from as many ties as possible if we are to maximise our chances for engaging in theoria. From this an argument for non-experience of sexual intercourse and hence abstinence from procreation can be derived. Procreation, marriage and the family are just such ties as reduce or eliminate our opportunities for theoria. Non-experience of sexual intercourse entails abstinence from procreation or at least did so in Aristotle's time. In the interests of theoria, this is an argument in its favour. This is not an argument explicitly to be found in Aristotle but it is based on what he says and is a reasonable inference from it. REFERENCES Aristotle, Nicomachean Ethics, various editions.

No symbol for 'why ?', I'd say for the following reason. Isn't logic's concern with the structure of propositions (statements, sentences) and predicates, and the relations of contradiction, implication and independence between them, also the valid and fallacious forms of argument (valid in the case e.g. of modus ponens, fallacious in that of affirming the consequent ? 'Why?' is usually an epistemological question rather than a logical one. In modus ponens, for example : If p then q p__________ q we do not look to logic to explain e.g. 'why p ?'. We look to it to identify p's role in valid or invalid arguments such as the above schema. See further Michael Gabbay, 'Logic with Added Reasoning', Ontarioo, 2002, Preface & ch. 1. My indication of logic's concerns at the start is not offered as a full refinement but only as a broad pointer. Refinement can be found in texts such as Gabbay's or Patrick Shaw's 'Logic and its Limits', London, 1981, where in turn more sophisticated texts are listed in the bibliographies. You also asked about 'what is'. Your example suggests you are thinking of disjunction : 'either it's X or it's Y'. Symbolically : 'V' or 'v' : 'X v Y'. The name of the symbol is 'vel'. 'Or' is ambiguous in logic : there's the inclusive or the exclusive 'or'. So, for example, 'Either X or Y (but not both)'. This is the exclusive use. But 'Either X or Y (or both)' illustrates the inclusive use : it includes both alternatives as possibly being the case. 'Either it's red or it's antique' - inclusive (it could be both). 'Either it's a circle or it's a square' - exclusive (it is one or the other but not both). Your example seems to employ the exclusive 'or' - either it is a car-crash or it is a kid oopping a balloon but not both. On the inclusive and exclusive uses of 'or' ('V') see Patrick Shaw, 'Logic and its Limits', London, 1981 : 49-51. 

It doesn't sound 'amusingly facile at all ! You're intrigued by a topic and this is the place to ask questions about it. Good for you. Here's my contribution. 

The 'only x and y principle' was introduced by Harold Noonan. Whether this is the best name for the principle is questionable but here is what Noonan says : 

It entails that acccording to Socrates - the Platonic Socrates - thinks there is another source knowledge. So, what is it ? ('Platonic Socrates' because here and elsewhere we can't be sure how far the views of the historical Socrates are represented.) â–» MENO AND KNOWLEDGE Because, as you put it, the view emerges in the Meno that knowledge can be neither gained nor searched for, it not follow that the possession of knowledge is impossible. Quite the opposite. In the dialogue Socrates elicits from a slave boy the right answers to certain geometrical questions : e.g that if the side of a square is two feet, the size of the figure is four square feet, and the questions delve into much further complications. The slave boy sometimes hesitates, sometimes gets things wrong, but without (it is claimed) any instruction from Socrates he is eventually able to prove Pythagoras' Theorem. Then he has knowledge. He did not seek it. He did not gain it from Socrates (or supposedly so - it's an open question how much knowledge is implicitly imparted by Socrates' questioning). He gained it, so Socrates hypothesises (81a-82b), by recollection (anamnesis). If the boy has geometrical knowledge, he has not acquired it in his present life; he must be recollecting from a past existence. Perhaps not the most cogent of Socrates hypotheses but there it is. I hope this eases your puzzlement. â–» REFERENCES Scott, Dominic, Recollection and Experience: Plato s Theory of Learning and its Successors, ISBN 10: 0521030919 / ISBN 13: 9780521030915 Published by CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY PRESS, United Kingdom, 2007.

So ontology (the existence of sensible objects) is not tied to epistemology (human perception). Hence my remark at tat start that Berkeley did not link epistemology and ontology so tightly as the Question quote suggests. But we might note that 'some other spirit' does not logically imply that it is the same other spirit, namely God. There could be a multiplicity of such spirits. â–» HISTORICAL ASIDE - BERKELEY AND THE GREEKS : PLATO The Question mentions a possible anticipation of Berkeley's view in Ancient Greek philosophy. Plato's Theaetetus comes to mind. Here's Miles Burnyeat on the point : 

This has nothing directly to do with morality at all. Someone who rejected the very idea of morality could still support libertarianism. 

If we take even the two major Greek gods, Zeus and Poseidon, in Greek mythology their power was limited. They had great power, power exceeding that of any other gods and any humans, but they were not omnipotent. Zeus could not command the seas, and Poseidon could not control the land. They and the other gods were a part of the cosmos : Poseidon's home was mainly the sea, and Zeus and subordinate gods such as Hera and Apollo lived on Mount Olympus. Both the sea and the mountain were clearly located in the cosmos, and not outside it. 

It may well be that when science gives out, and is unable to answer questions of vital and fundamental interest, then religion will find a permanent place to step in and offer its own answers. This is a psychological point, not of great philosophical interest. For myself, I think religion has a deeper rationale - whether rationally adequate or not I offer no view here. The trouble, when scientific explanations give out and fall short of answering 'why?' questions, is that religious explanations carry as many 'whys ?' in their train as science does. If God created the universe and the laws or quantum probabilities on which it runs, why did God create the universe ? Could God have created just any universe, so one in which none of the recognised rules of logic or truths of mathematics applies ? If God is or was the First Cause, then how is God's own existence to be explained ? Did God create Godself ? If God is omnipotent, does that mean that God can do anything or only what it is possible to do ? And if only what is possible, why that limit ? If God forbids X, does God forbid X because it is wrong or is it wrong because God forbids it. (Plato's essential problem in different terms in the 'Euthyphro', of course.) Anyone who thinks that this is a crack at religion will quite have misssed the point. Which is as I said at the start : that if you bring in religion to answer 'why ?' questions that science cannot answer, you will have opened the door to a whole new set of 'why ?' questions with which religion is itself beset. That this is so follows, for instance, from Aquinas' view that we not only do not but cannot know the essence of God : without knowledge of that essence we cannot answer the questions raised above. This does not make science 'no better' than religion; equally it does not mean that religion is 'pointless' because in the end it leaves us with as many unanswered fundamental questions as science. I am trying to hold the balance even. In a different metaphor, I am just suggesting that if science leads us into a maze of unanswered questions, jumping over the hedge to religion will land us in another maze of questions ultimately as baffling.
