One way to think of the setup is as the groupoid underlying the 2-group being a $\operatorname{ker} t$ bundle gerbe (i.e. a 2-bundle) over $\operatorname{coker} t$ in the category of groups. Another way to think of this is as an extension of the delooping $\mathbf{B}\operatorname{coker} t$ (a one-object groupoid) by the double delooping $\mathbf{B}^2\ker t$ (a one-object, one-arrow 2-groupoid), giving the one-object 2-groupoid $\mathbf{B}\mathcal{G}$ - here I've written $\mathcal{G}$ for the 2-group. This latter interpretation makes the connection to group cohomology clearer. Taking the nerve and geometric realisation of this latter version gives you a topological $B^2\operatorname{ker} t$ bundle over $B\operatorname{coker}t$ (using the fact $B\operatorname{ker}t$ is an abelian group, here). One can then construct the lifting bundle gerbe for the extension $$ B\operatorname{ker}t \to EB\operatorname{ker}t \to B^2\operatorname{ker}t $$ to get a $B\operatorname{ker}t$ bundle gerbe, and then construct the lifting bundle 2-gerbe for the extension $$ \operatorname{ker}t \to E\operatorname{ker}t \to B\operatorname{ker}t, $$ giving you a $\operatorname{ker}t$-2-bundle gerbe, which is a 3-bundle, rather than a 2-bundle. It then depends what you want, and what you want to do with it, as to which construction you use. 

For a simplicial group $G$, there is a universal bundle $WG \to \overline{W}G$ in the category of simplicial sets, detailed in for example May's book (djvu). Now $WG$ has a simple enough description in terms of $G$ that I would expect one could construct a contracting homotopy directly. Has this been done in the literature? The proof in May's book (and in the original sources) that $WG$ is contractible goes via showing that $WG$ is 'of type (W)', and that such simplicial sets are Kan, simply-connected and have trivial homology. 

I'm teaching myself bits and pieces of forcing at the moment, for the purposes of translating them into sheaf-theoretic versions. I'm trying to write down what I feel is a cleaner description of the Easton product of forcing posets, by which I mean a global description rather than one in terms of elements like $$ \left|{(\kappa,α,β) ∈ dom(p) : \kappa\leq \lambda}\right| \lt \lambda \qquad (1) $$ for $p$ in the Easton product $\prod^E P(\kappa)$, which is not very useful at the level of the category of sets if it is not the category of ZF(C)-sets. I'm confident I understand what this condition does when you do the forcing, namely I think it puts a bound on how many sets are added to any given $\lambda$, else you might get silly things like a proper class of sets added to some set. However, at the risk of embarrassing myself, and in the interest of educating others, here is my best guess for what this condition translates to. Consider, as Jech does (Set theory, 3rd edition), first the Easton product over some set $A$ of regular cardinals. For $\kappa\in A$, let $P(\kappa)$ be the set of functions $p:D(p)\to 2$ where $D(p)\subset \kappa\times B(\kappa)$ has cardinality less than $\kappa$. Here $B(\kappa)$ is some cardinal, not necessarily given by an Easton function on regular cardinals, and forcing using the 'usual order' on this poset will add $B(\kappa)$ subsets to each $\kappa\in A$. There is a distinguished element $\top$ of each $P(\kappa)$, namely the unique function $\emptyset \to 2$. Let $P=\prod P(\kappa)$ be the product over $\kappa\in A$. The Easton product is the subset consisting of those $p\in P$ such that the support condition (1) holds. So what does this mean? An element $p\in P$ is a collection of functions $p_\kappa$, one for each $\kappa\in A$. Then let $supp(p) \subset A$ be the set of those $\kappa\in A$ such that $p_\kappa\not=\top$. Analogously, define $supp_\lambda(p) \subset A$ to be the set of those $\kappa\leq \lambda$ such that $p_\kappa\not=\top$. This last definition is where I am the most unsure, as the definition in Jech really involves $supp(p)\cap \lambda$, which doesn't make sense from a structural set theory point of view unless $\lambda$ is viewed as a subset of $A$ (even though it makes perfect sense in a material set theory such as ZFC). Now assuming the definition of $supp_\lambda(p)$ is correct, the support condition on $p$ as first stated in Jech is that $$ \forall \text{ regular } \lambda, \left|supp_\lambda(p)\right| \lt \lambda.\qquad (2) $$ Apparently it's enough to enforce (2) whenever $\lambda$ is weakly inaccessible, (though Friedman just says 'inaccessible'), and that's fine by me. However, this doesn't look the same as the condition (1), which has me slightly worried. The condition (1) imposes a condition on the size of the domain of $p$ as well as (2), and in fact implies that the domain of $p_\kappa$ is smaller than $\kappa$ for all $\kappa$. So where has my reasoning gone wrong? At this point I really just want to understand the set underlying the Easton product, rather than any intricacies of class forcing. 

Yes to both. A natural transformation is a functor $C\times 2 \to D$, the nerve preserves products, and the nerve of $2$ is the 1-simplex. Geometric realisation gives homotopic maps. The second is elementary by the definition of nerve. 

Stacks qua moduli spaces were introduced to keep track of nontrivial automorphisms of the objects they parameterize. In essence they are groupoids of objects with some form geometric cohesion. The classic example is principal bundles/torsors, the whole category of which is actually a groupoid. But what about objects one might want to parameterise which have non-invertible maps between them, such as vector bundles, or coherent sheaves? One could imagine a stack of such objects, because they 'glue' as principal bundles do, but if one keeps track of all maps this thing should be a category, not a groupoid. It is certainly deserving of being promoted to something geometric, and so one could present it by a category in algebraic spaces or schemes, much as the stacks we are more familiar with are presented by algebraic groupoids. Some might argue that we have classifying topoi or similar for these situations, and this is well and good, but what about some geometry on these topoi? I know of two different takes on classifying topoi of a small (internal) category, one approach involving flat functors and the other torsors for the groupoid of all invertible arrows of the category in question. Between these two competing definitions, there are arguments (at least in my own head, too fuzzy to unveil here) both ways, and concrete examples of where one uses stacks of categories in a geometric context would certainly push the balance in one direction or another. This isn't the only reason I would like to know an answer to this question, but it has some bearing - and I've rabbited on long enough.
