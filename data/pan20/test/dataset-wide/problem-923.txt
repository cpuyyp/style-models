The original French shows that the Wikipedia reference, which seems to be some translation, is correct (emphasis mine): 

The Wikipedia article on Stephen King's Carrie says that Carrie is based on two girls in King's schools. It has this quote, with a "citation needed" attached: 

If one would believe Joe Nocera, former op-ed columnist for The New York Times: No. In an article titled The Harper Lee ‘Go Set a Watchman’ Fraud (July 24, 2015 - the book was published on July 14, 2015), Nocera claims that this is a money grab from Lee's current protector, Tonja Carter. Harper Lee: The Sadness of a Sequel (February 3, 2015) in The Atlantic notes: 

Have you considered your own biases? Do you believe yourself to be perfectly unbiased and informed? Can any biased person judge that a text is unbiased? 

Related trope: The curtains are blue. Human language is imperfect, and humans as well. The author may have tried to communicate and idea, yet they may have an imperfect command of the language, or of the art of story-telling, or may have used devices which undermined their intentions. Is it still relevant today? It is still relevant today, and it shall remain relevant: As time passes, language changes, the context changes, and it becomes more and more difficult to divine authorial intent. An author's creation often far outlives the author. Works are read without any knowledge of the author or the circumstances in which the work was created, and acquire a meaning of their own in the minds of the reader. This meaning cannot be dismissed because the author seemed to have intended another meaning. 

So we have several instances of various classes of people, some of them Etonians themselves, associating a characteristic slouch with Eton — especially in the early twentieth century (around the same time Peter and Wendy came out). From this, the very passage quoted in the question can be taken as evidence that the public school in question is Eton. 

The point here is not that SF that's not about people isn't SF, but that such fiction has no point (just as science that doesn't have anything to do with people isn't not-science). 

The phrase "natural lord and king" (or just "natural lord") refers to the king. There are various examples of this: 

However, from the AC novels I have read (the first five to be published, IIRC), there is no mention at all of present day events. I don't recall how exactly the event in the spoiler block happened in the corresponding book, but Desmond Miles makes no appearance, of that I am sure. Why aren't the present day events and characters part of the AC books? 

These things seem to indicate that, a little by little, Macondo was slowly becoming less and less real, more and more mirage, until, of course, it was wiped out from reality in its entirety. 

It's probably the solstice in December. One could consider the solstices as the two changes in the year (others may well consider the equinoxes to be the two changes). However, Christmas is around the December solstice, and Western story-telling often treats Christmas as a magical and exciting time, so I think this refers to the solstice. 

The Grishneshwar Jyotirlinga temple is a relatively famous Shiva temple. But it's about three hundred kilometers from Solapur. Even though both are in the same state of Maharashtra, I don't know what possessed Brown to mix the two up. 

From these lines, it seems to me that the monster is saying he will not further violate the king's law - provided Frankenstein fulfills his responsibilities. 

There is a case to be made about the humanity itself (or some of it) being asexual at first. In some myths, Pandora is the first woman, created by Hephaestus for Zeus to punish humanity. Pandora's arrival and the subsequent disasters mark the end of the Golden Age of Man. What exactly were all those men doing before she came? While homosexual love was definitely not news to the ancient Greeks, would all of humanity be involved in homosexual love until the first human woman came? It is possible that some might have been asexual. 

First, I have to ask: do you have a clear definition for bias? Think on this for a moment. Let's look at some of the meanings given, for instance, by Merriam-Webster: 

In the book Charles Dickens in Context, by Sally Ledger and Holly Furneaux, quoting from Google Books: 

The Assassin's Creed games mostly have a present-day component, where the protagonist's descendent enters the Animus, reliving the protagonist's life. Since this is merely replaying memories, we don't actually affect the past in the game, but, in Assassin's Creed II: Revelations: 

This sounds like Franchise, a 1955 short story by Isaac Asimov. In Franchise, Asimov's grand computer, Multivac, selects a single person to answer a series of questions which determines the result of the election. Also see this similar post on the Sci-Fi and Fantasy SE, which includes a fuller description and a link to the story in the comments. 

As a personal opinion, the exact name used for someone who uses fetishes for magic is not very important. Burroughs uses the term witch doctor, or even shaman. Usually, I have seen fetish magic applied in fiction by magicians in a tribal context. For example, with terms like shouldermen (guess the fetish!) or bonecaster in the Malazan Book of the Fallen, the meaning is apparent if you have seen such tribal magic elsewhere in fiction. I think you could use whichever of these terms or their translations is most likely to be familiar with your target audience without much loss of fidelity. 

In A Game of Thrones, Chapter 24, when Tyrion Lannister visits Winterfell on the way back from the Wall: 

The "natural" aspect, as far as I can tell, arises from the principle of divine right - the king is the king by grace of God, and as such, is naturally the subject's lord (unlike other positions in the nobility, which are usually positions created by human law and not God's natural law).
