The only one on your list that is no fun when wet is the Golden Gate visit. The following are all do-able on foot - I used the trolley cars as part of my exploration when I went to see the following: 

I'd suggest moving further back on your board (as long as you can still catch the wave) and then as soon as you are on the wave hold one rail to turn along the wave. You'll want to be heading along the wave anyway, as otherwise the breaking section will catch you, so just make sure you start this early. Going along a wave requires more speed than just heading in at 90 degrees, so this is all a balancing act. You can press down with your hands near the front of the board, while your weight is further back, in order to catch the wave, and then moving your hands further back effectively pulls your weight back. 

Depends on what you mean by climbing. If it is still walking up a steep slope then these should give you added grip on snow. If you are actually climbing then they will be of no use at all, as in this situation you need to be able to use your toes and sides of your feet as well as the soles. Personally, in both scenarios I would rather use appropriate footwear and have the skis strapped to my pack. 

If it is steep enough to count as a climb I use rock boots. Hiking boots are only useful when walking on trails where you need tread to grip. Smooth rocks are best climbed with the kind of smooth rubber soles you have on rock boots. You could take both though and change as needed. 

I used to think I knew the answer to this, from having a couple of very small leeches, but this guidance from wildmadagascar.com is quite comprehensive: 

If you know exactly where your bindings need to be fixed then you don't need the demo plate, and fixing directly to the ski gives a more rigid connection between boot and ski. A demo plate is only really useful if you need adjustment. 

Most applications will let you minimise your margins, which reduces waste, then all you do is cut the margin off one page, and then stick that page over the other one, which gives you a solid connection - adhesive tape front and back. 

In addition to Graham's answer, if you can't reach the top but have to descend again you have two options: 

Aside from that, they look similar and the same styles and shapes are available. Additionally (and I didn't know this until I saw one that confused me) - you can have a technical axe with the blade and the shaft rated separately. For example a T shaft for strength and durability, with a B blade for flexibility. 

By far the simplest and most hygienic solution is to buy two sets. That way when you change shoes the other pair can breathe and dry out. This should be the preferred option. It also means you don't need to worry about what kind of tape to use. 

If you are in extremely cold climes, setting a fire inside your shelter may be essential. Key issues are around getting enough oxygen in to it, and getting the smoke out. Taking these in reverse order: 

As most animals that you are likely to catch need water, use this as a brief stopgap (a few days) while you find their water source, which is hopefully not too far away. 

When I go hiking with my wife or a mixed group, we don't use any fixed figures of x%. Instead we all know roughly what weight we are happy carrying, and if someone feels they could carry more they will offer to help out someone who appears to be struggling or overloaded. In general, if you are experienced hikers, you will have your pack size/type pretty well nailed for most occasions so shouldn't need to do this, but you may have an inexperienced member of the team, or someone may be a bit off their usual strength through illness etc. My advice - just work it out between you. 

That's it. Seriously. All you really need to focus on is upper body strength and cardiovascular fitness, and you can do all of these without buying equipment. Technique can help a lot as well - when you arrive at the beach watch the water for a while. Learn where the breaks are, and where the rip will help you paddle out (If you use the rip correctly you don't really need to use any energy to get out to beyond the break) Oh, and of course the best exercise for surfing is surfing... 

These will all help - but nothing office-based will really cover off the fitness requirements fully, especially cardio so I'd suggest using the gym, swimming or running as further exercise. 

Excluding the legality question, as to be honest, that's likely to depend on who detects you, and how much it interferes with licensed traffic, the safety angle has a couple of aspects: 

As a keen car camping family with 3 kids, I can definitely recommend your second option - it has sufficient power and capacity to make meals for 5 without taking up too much space. It is light, easy to clean, and the small gas canisters for it are available in a huge number of places. It is also light enough that if you are having to lift your gear a few hundred metres from the car it won't be a problem, whereas the ones that run off the big canisters get quite heavy quite quickly! The top option you pictured - the single canister backpacking stove - is fine for camping on your own, but it does suffer when trying to cook for a group. 

So, there are a number of challenges you face. Firstly, what is the reason for wanting a mizzen? It will change the sailing characteristics significantly, as well as require a lot of work. tl;dr - this is a fair old undertaking to do for no obvious reason. If you do decide to add one, you have 2 real options - a small, unstayed mizzen off the transom, or a a taller stayed mizzen. The first won't require a lot of work - your existing shrouds should be fine, however you will need to work a way to mount your mizzen without conflicting with the tiller. Not a major deal, but still fiddly. The second is likely to require at a minimum: 

I think you won't be able to do much with your existing rucksack, but there are many out there specifically designed to avoid the sweaty back. Deuter make a range of rucksacks with their Airstripes system: 

The Hohner fits easily down the side of my bigger rucksacks, and the amp is tiny. They don't add a huge amount to the weight of my pack If the weather is wet I'll wrap them both in a plastic bag, but they have entertained me on many Munro tops. I have never had any wildlife attracted to the sound, but perhaps that says more about my playing than anything else. 

Firstly, Bear Grylls is notorious for not doing things the way they look on television, but actually conducting extensive planning, multiple attempts, using alternative methods to get better camera angles, and in some instances, apparently going to stay in a hotel! But with regard to your question, there are a lot of things you can do to gain a good assessment of water depth: 

Citronella candles set up around a perimeter are what we use when camping. If we are going somewhere exceptionally bug-ridden, we do sometimes use DEET - it is much more effective, but rather toxic. As long as you are spraying and then leaving the area, I'd go with DEET. I hadn't realised it would melt plastic (thanks @Liam) so be careful where you spray it. 

Have you tried fitting them both into a single pillowcase? That should keep them together for you. Failing that, if you are car camping, why not just take your normal pillow? Presumably you don't have any weight or space issues. That's what I do when car camping. 

I think this is quite a tricky one. Even when I read the Health & Safety Executive guidance in the UK (a country quite keen on its health and safety rules) it isn't clear: HSE has an 'Are You a Tree Surgeon' page, which links directly to their Working at Height page. There we have: 

Generally, thorns will not dissolve in the body. Very small ones may work their way out, but they may not. Treat them and any other sharp objects as possible sources of infection. The first thing to do is check to see how badly the skin is broken. A baby wipe can be enough for this. If you can see an entry wound, then you should be able to find whether the object is still inside. If you can see it, and can get it with a pair of tweezers, then now is a good time to remove it. If you can't get it with tweezers it may be worthwhile waiting until your next evening stop, as extraction using a needle will break the skin more so you want to do it in a cleaner environment if possible, as well as let the skin heal overnight. Once extracted, a big wound should have a plaster affixed over it. Waterproof plasters are a hiking essential - but you will need to fix them to clean, dry skin in order to work. Treat them as a buffer to stop infection. If you cannot see a wound, then you may just want to check a bit further down the trail for swelling, redness etc. 

For certain types of hiking, lightness is key. I can't talk for everyone doing that (some may just be unaware of the consequences of their kit choices) but I really like speed hiking / fell running, and for that I use very lightweight Salomon boots that are almost trainers/sneakers. My wife briefly tried the Vibram Five Fingers and really liked them for hiking. I'm quite happy with these on a 20 mile a day trek with minimal pack as long as it is reasonably dry and I'm not on actual mountains. If I'm trekking in the Highlands, across bogland or if the weather is looking to be really wet, proper boots will win, but they are heavy. Much heavier than fell-runners. 

If you get that sort of snowfall, the correct safety procedures include clearing snow every couple of hours. Set your alarm and get out to clear snow - especially from the entrance, but all round if it looks like the tent will get covered. The tents used in the Antarctic are shaped like steep pyramids to help avoid the problem of snow buildup - dome tents are just too susceptible to this problem. 

A snow shovel will make your life a lot easier, yes - it gives you the option to dig out snow to use as a windbreak, and to lower the tent a little into the snow, reducing the wind. Digging down a little also lets you reach more packed snow, which makes it easier to provide a flat surface. You shouldn't need any extra insulation under the floor - although if temperatures are reasonably warm (not far under freezing) you may want to use a good groundsheet as you may melt some of the snow directly underneath you and you don't want that soaking in to the tent. 

I got the yaktracks a couple of years ago and they have performed really well - through two sub -15 degree winters. They have enough flexibility that I still managed to run in them for a couple of hours at a time, and very easy to remove when entering a building. This takes about 20 seconds for each one. Where there is a layer of ice or snow on a pavement they give immense amounts of grip, but if the pavement has been cleared you will be better off removing them. 

Just keep climbing-is sort of the right answer, but you need to fit it in to your training and recovery schedule. I kept climbing all the way through training for various marathons. My solution was to do a climb a week in place of one of my small to medium sized runs. If this happened to be right after a really long run then I might focus more on bouldering and overhangs (ie upper body) otherwise a normal climb (heavy focus on legs) Good luck with your marathon. 

Who says you can't hike? If you have no medical concerns (ie high blood pressure, blood results showing complications etc) then guidance is to keep doing the sports you enjoy (with some exceptions - generally sports where impact or similar forces could cause injury - bungee jumping, motor racing etc - and those that could cause excess damage to ligaments, as these soften towards the later stages of pregnancy) I don't know the two particular hikes you mention, but as long as you are aware of your water/food requirements and plan accordingly, there is nothing to stop you hiking as you normally would. Kayaking may depend on the water - I wouldn't plan an extreme white water trip, but lake or calm seas or rivers may be fine - plan for more frequent stops and remain comfortable. Skiing is similar - don't plan on black runs, but you'll find many people ski on more moderate runs while pregnant. If you feel like you are comfortable doing it at 5 months then just do it. My wife was still running 10k runs at 8 months with one of our children, and did a 10k walk the day before my youngest was born. Keeping fit and having regular exercise is considered a very good thing during pregnancy, so while you won't manage adrenaline sports, activities in general will be fine. Plus: It's your honeymoon - have fun!
