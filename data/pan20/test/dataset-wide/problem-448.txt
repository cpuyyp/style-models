Their society would have evolved drastically different then ours. Its highly likely that people would trade with these years. Religious cults practicing child sacrifices for the greater good of their great leaders. Maybe people would even straight out produce children to sell them. This is something hard to get rid of, because even if you make it illegal, a black market will emerge. People wanting to buy those years will get them, no matter what they need to do. Furthermore, it might be beneficial to have a regulated market where everyone can buy the years he wants. Getting the years of the killed means that you give murder a whole new - very attractive - incentive. Murder is no longer petty, it is good for your own health. Who wouldn't be tempted by the prospect of living forever if only he killed someone every now and then? Its basically the premise of every moral struggle in vampire stories, e.g. TVD et al.. That means a regulated market will be needed to keep murder rates down. If you can prolong your life at an affordable price, without much hassle, then its much better to do so instead of going on an unsanctioned killing-spree. The market will need to be affordable enough so that most people can buy the years they need or want. Maybe its even subsidized, so that even the financially weak aren't tempted by murder. Otherwise people will start to "steal" these years by simply killing random people. In such a society, the conviction of a murder is only a good to be sold. Maybe there is a tombola. Or an auction. Or a raflle, or any other kind of give-away. Someone has to produce all those years for the market anyways, so this is an excellent opportunity to boost numbers. Some people will inevitably be very, very old. 

You would have absolutely no seasons whatsoever, and thus - depending on the output of your star - either a lush evergreen jungle or a desert, or anything in between, but no changing environment that has different behavior depending on seasons. Also, lack of moonlight being reflected means pitch dark nights, which would influence predators. Better night vision is necessary, while other species might prefer to stay in sheltered locations during the night. Fire (or another light source) will be very important for an intelligent species that does not have night vision. Sun dials as clocks will not be possible, so time has to be kept track of in another way. Similarly, animals need to have some kind of "sixth sense" to tell time and to go to shelter in time. How they do that without any apparent way to tell the time? No idea, honestly. Plantlife would probably develop differently, since trees will now completely block the light. So no plants underneath trees anymore (with a rising/setting sun, those get at least some sunlight, if the sun is fixed, they do not). For an intelligent species, navigation would be difficult without a way to tell cardinal directions by watching the sun. There will be lots of small but noticeable differences, listing them all would prove futile. 

Then that is what happens. You are talking about a fictional device with fictional properties. You have not specified how your forcefield works, what mechanism it uses (and you can't, because its fictional). That means you can hand-wave it however you want. If the force field does not conduct heat, then the lava flows hot and fluid. But if no energy passes the forcefield (no heat), then how would light pass through it? Ah, simply say that it does. If the force field acts more like an actual, physical barrier, it will conduct heat. it will be hot on the outside of the forcefield (where no lava is), but this process that carries heat away will allow the lava to cool down. 

The only idea I haven't seen mentioned is the flying aircraft carrier. Imagine the dragon lifting a few soldiers with gliders strapped to their backs. At altitude, it releases the archers and they rain death from above. The archers may need to be in 2-man gliders with a pilot/bomber and archer. If the dragon(s) could release the gliders from behind enemy lines, they could cause a lot of havoc, but with the disadvantage that they have to land behind enemy lines or fly over the lines to reach friendly ground. Even dropped from friendly airspace, the gliders would have the benefit of gravity and elevation while shooting/bombing. In this mode, the dragon becomes a glorified elevator which substitutes for a nearby hill/mountain (which may not be present at the battlefield). If each dragon only had a few gliders to worry about, it could release them at high altitude (where they could start with bombing), let them glide down to some flight floor (where they can snipe with bows), and then pick them up again in mid-air, to bring them back up to the flight ceiling. In between, it could strafe enemy lines and do its normal dragon-thing. The gliders would be a force multiplier for the dragon's flying ability, to potentially devastating effect. In the same way, dragons could act as long-range siege artillery by lifting battering rams made out of giant logs and stubby glider wings (and, of course, an iron ram head). Since dragons are not necessarily experts at ballistics and aerodynamics, you would ideally want the ram to be guided on the way down (so the dragon can drop it from very high and far away, which provides both safety to the dragon and lots of kinetic energy for a big boom). Some elite pilots could ride the ram down, using basic flight controls, and jump off at the last minute, deploying their personal gliders for a safe landing. If you drop it from high enough, a battering ram will have enough energy to blow through not just the main gate, but pretty much any reinforced structure made of stone, so you could blow a hole through any large part of the outer wall that is easy to aim at. Of course, you still have to deal with the moat, but you don't need a roof on the ram to defend against elevated attacks. Also, the ram should be moving fast enough close to impact that it is nearly impossible to hit with arrows, so the pilots should be mostly safe (except for the fact that they are riding an inert missile!). 

$URL$ The basic idea is that you don't need conventional optics to form an image. You can trade compute for optics and dispense with lenses and other trappings of macroscopic cameras. In theory, I would assume the type of camera described above could be made arbitrarily small. 

I imagine a society filled with Ender Wiggins. In some respects, we should expect it to look a lot like our society right now. There would still be Taylor Swifts and Kanye Wests, but their fans would not be fanatical. They would be the moms and dads of today's concerts, rather than the screaming teenagers, and they might go to concerts as much out of a sense of irony as any particular love of the music. There would be political parties, but the parties would appeal to the highest thinkers rather than the lowest. Instead of just promising to give away stuff to the masses, they would try to claim that their vision of the future is the most accurate, and extends the furthest. The debate would not be about whether climate change is anthropogenic, but rather which allocation of resources most appropriately deals with the near and far-term future. Credibility would be based on analysis and information-gathering, rather than pandering. If actual fanatics existed at all, they would do so as a higher-order tactic to achieve an obscured goal. Every major action would have a double-, triple-, quadruple-meaning and intent. The world would be a giant game of chess. If someone committed an act of terror, it would cause real terror, not because it is random, but because everyone would know that it is carefully calculated, and you either understand the cause (and can avoid a similar fate), or you don't (and you are already behind the curve). Some people would still choose to be homeless or vagrants or hippies, but probably very few would be low-wage workers, because they would realize in school that the path which leads to drudge work does not optimize personal happiness (in the future...of course, it usually is the result of consuming all the happiness in the present). On the one hand, cooperation would be maximized, because there are many situations in which it is rationally optimal but not chosen because of irrationality. On the other hand, this would make more appealing targets for high-functioning sociopaths, who are necessarily rational and open-minded (because ultimately, cooperation requires trust, and trust is the primary currency of sociopaths). I would guess that this world would be both more exciting and more terrifying. Human value systems would likely change more quickly, and we might view this society as barbaric in some respects. They might decide that eating dead people is perfectly acceptable and a good way to recycle resources. It might look like an extreme form of libertarianism. In many respects, it may look like a lot of cyberpunk societies. 

Does the axis of rotation change with it? Because if the axis of rotation stays fixed wrt. to the sun, then you'd have one half of the planet bathed in sunlight for half a year, and the other half in complete darkness for half a year. Pretty hostile. If the axis of rotation also changes, not much would be different. The sun is almost completely a perfect sphere (one of the most perfect spheres we have yet found in nature), so I suspect that radiation emitted is quite uniform. many features of the sun are equally found at the poles and at the equator (e.g. coronal holes). But our ability to reach other planets would be drastically dimished, because plane changes are very, very expensive. You have to spend $\Delta v = v_0 \cdot sin \left( \frac \theta 2 \right)$ m/s just to change the plane. In case of the earth, the mean orbital speed is ~30km/s, so you would need another 21km/s delta-v for the plane change. This is pretty prohibitive (say goodbye to space travel to anything else then the moon). And you'd have to explain how that came to be, since conservation of angular momentum dictates that all bodies should (roughly) orbit in the same plane. So such a solar system could only evolve if the planet got pulled there by another big source of gravity, e.g. a big rogue planet passing through. I sadly don't have good information on the suns radiation from the poles. But the suns magnetosphere does not seem to be much of a concern for your planet. A much greater concern would be the stability of the orbit. Jupiter and the other bodies perturb the earths orbit, but since we are in the same plane, the system is quite stable for the forseeable (million of years) future. but with Earth being heavily inclined, I could imagine the system to be a lot less stable. Maybe you plug it into Universe Sandbox or similar see the results. 

Whatever suits your needs. The job is dangerous. If the rewards are high enough, people will do that job. This can go either way. High one-off payments (high bounties on the monsters, for examples) will motivate risky behavior. everyone hopes to slay enough monsters to get enough saving so that he/she can retire. This opens possibilities for broke ex-hunters who have spent all their savings. Or you provide other benefits. maybe the guilds have insurances and pay their members. If the insurance is good, then its just a job like every other, even if riskier. 

Transport to where? Into the empty void of space? Thats certain death. habitable planets are a rarity, and you have even said that help is 12 light-hours away. That means there simply isn't anything in transporter range. The only option would be to transport the crew from where they are currently standing into the escape pods. However, the escape pods are a last resort. The ship is already failing. power could go out any moment due to the damaged core.The batlle with the pirates has damaged a lot of systems. transporters are an intricate piece of technology, the slightest malfunction can be fatal. Its a little bit like elevators and fires. you don#t use an elevator when the building is on fire because it might already be compromised. You don't use the transporters for the same reason - the are no longer safe to use, and running on foot to the nearest escape pod is the safest solution. Another problem is throughput. While it might be possible to transport a few people at a time, transporters might simply not be able to mass-transport several hundred people at once from all over the ship. Furthermore, your assumption of panicking and chaos might be wrong. The crew of a spaceship is likely well trained and has regular safety exercises in order to ensure an orderly and timely evacuation.
