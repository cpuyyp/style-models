You mention a number of manufacturers there, but to be honest it's not so much the bike manufacturers you need to think about (there is no "standard frame"), its the manufacturers of the components - the groupset - which fit onto the frame. The key players there are Shimano, SRAM and (in some places, for road bikes only), Campagnolo. These companies are safe bets as regards "standard" parts, - inasmuch as you buy into a particular manufacturer, who will offer either parts or an upgrade path. I think there is a tendency for them all to push newer and shinier parts - that's their business after all - which could be "upgrades" that you don't actually need, so you need to become savvy in that respect. So yeah, the big plus is the effective standardisation of parts. Actually fitting them and removing them can still range from being easy to being a PITA, depending on what you're trying to do. No change there. 

A fixie will be easier to maintain than a geared bike purely because it has no derailleurs. On all your other points would be satisfied by either type of bike, you'll just need to spec them when you buy. If you do end up buying a fixed gear bike, make sure it has standard brakes - do not rely on the pedals as your brake. That kind of approach is great on a track but not on the road. On a totally subjective note, I have four bikes and the fixie has become my firm favourite. Great fun to ride and very easy to maintain. I gave mine a full service a couple of months ago, right down to swapping out the bottom bracket, and it took just a couple of hours. 

I assume given the distance, that you're doing this journey on a road and on a road bike? You'll be pleased to learn that, as Criggie says, your height is pretty much irrelevant. You will need to decide between shorts and bibshorts (which come up over your shoulders). Many riders prefer bibshorts because they dispense with the line of elastic around your waist, leaving your stomach "unpressured". But it does really boil down to personal preference. You also need to remember that there's no silver bullet here. Many experienced cyclists will choose a particular brand of clothing because they tried it in the past and it worked for them. And, not all brands of clothing work for all riders. Having said that, if you are looking for high-end kit and are prepared to pay for it, I would suggest you could do a lot worse than to look at the kit that the professional teams are using. Not the replica kit, but the team issue kit. You'll pay for it - I'm guessing a ballpark of â‚¬200 for a pair of bibshorts - but you are at least getting kit that has been designed to be worn for 5-6 hours over a few hundred kilometers. Alternatively, you could go to a good (online?) cycle shop, and to start looking at the most expensive kit they stock. It is a bit of a crass argument to say "best == most expensive", but really until you develop a taste where you can say "such-and-such a brand works well for me", you have to make a punt of some kind. 

My four-year-old, carbon-framed road bike has developed a case of creaky cranks. I only hear creaking when pedalling hard, when I pedal more softly it just sounds like it has always done. Given the bike's age it just seems like a good idea to replace the bottom bracket. But I was wondering, once I get the old bb out, how best to prep the frame before fitting the new bb? I've only changed BBs on steel frames before, where I applied some pretty thick grease quite liberally around the shell. But is approach applicable to carbon? Some supplementary info: I'm riding a 2010 Giant TCR Advanced 2, with a 6700 Ultegra groupset, including hollowtech 2 cranks. I believe from the bike's spec that the bb involved is a press-fit bb, as shown on the Wiggle site. Having said that I've not taken anything off yet so this is all theoretical so far - I'm going to visit my LBS later today to get the relevant preload cap removal tool, so I can have a bit of a look around. 

This is a difficult question because ultimately when cycling in traffic there's no substitute for experience, and even then its really out of your hands when you get some bonehead behind the wheel. I can't imagine your age would come into play, but its good that you seem to be aware of the risks - I have a teenage daughter who will ride without lights and helmet and I am continually hassling her about it. You say you live in Wa, is there any law there that would make you automatically liable if you were riding on the sidewalk and collided with a pedestrian? If so, that may be an incentive toward riding on the road. Aside from the legal, I think long-term you should get yourself comfortable in traffic and ride on the road. But the "now" will be about getting that comfort in the first place. In no particular order... 

Looks like 28 x 1 3/8 (although I did have to squint a bit!), or 700 x 35 if you prefer metric. I think they're pretty standard, I seem to remember having a hybrid that had this size wheel. For example, the first result on a google search shows one on Amazon. That particular one is a Kenda but I'd lay odds that all the main manufacturers will make this size. As regards an on-the-road fix, I carry a repair kit (glue & patches) but to be honest would only use if absolutely necessary. Its pretty cheap, and certainly easier, to carry a spare tube. That plus a couple of levers, plus a small pump or CO2, should get you home. I like to carry some disposable latex gloves as well, just to minimise how mucky I get. If you start getting regular punctures, look more at what tyres you're riding. 

Look at the angle of the guy's back, that's the key to why they say that. For performance, the back will be in a more horizontal position. You need to be careful, though, how much faith you put into this sticker - if at all possible you should try both sizes and judge for yourself. Also, don't forget that different frames, with different geometries and tube angles, will also come into play. If you test the two sizes, and you still end up thinking that neither one fits you better than the other, at that point you could apply the smaller=performance/larger=comfort principle. This advice is especially true for somewhere like Decathlon, which is a large enough store that a shop will probably have both sizes in stock (or could get hold of them if you ask). I bought a hybrid bike from Decathlon many years ago, they had height versus size charts then, but I remember totally ignoring them and buying the size that they said was for someone a whole 15cm/6" taller than me, just based on how comfortable that particular size felt when I rode it. I'm not saying that's how it would be for you and for this bike, it's just how it was for me - it's quite an individual thing. 

Yeah, you should be fine just to replace the chainrings. Make sure you replace them with Shimano (road) kit that is compatible with your 9-speed setup and you'll be fine. Note that rings designed for a 10-speed setup will strictly speaking be incompatible, since the 10-speed chain is narrower than the 9-speed chain. I have been told that you should be able to get away with this mismatch, although it will be suboptimal. As a side note though, I'm not at all sure that this change will make you faster. Sure, riding on the large ring going downhill might give you a little more "oomph" (5% tops) but would you likely lose that advantage because climbing would be that much harder? And how much time do you spend in top gear anyway? I mean obviously the wisdom of this change is entirely your call, but if it were me I'd think hard before I'd part with my cash on this particular upgrade. For hard numbers as regards the gear ratios of what you have and what you're thinking of buying, check out Sheldon's Gear Calculator. 

Bikes which have 27 gears will have triple chainrings at the front. Three rings can be very useful to give you lower gears, typically when you might struggle at climbing, or carry a load such as when touring. For example, I have an Audax bike which has a triple chainset. Its by no means a thoroughbread in terms of performance, but its suitable for a wide range of rides including multi-day trips. However if you're looking at a "racer" bike, it is far more common to find just a double chainset at the front. In fact, many manufacturers produce double chainrings which will give you almost the same range of gears (but not quite) as a triple - these are called compact chainsets. A double chainset will be what gives rise to your existing 14 gears (2 rings at the front, 7 cogs at the back), or the 20 gears (2 x 10) you've seen. In fact both Shimano and Campagnolo (I'm not sure about SRAM, but these three manufacturers dominate the market) now produce 11-cog rear cassettes, which would give rise to 22 gears. But 11-speed cassettes are at the high end of their respective product ranges, and 10-speed is far more common. Note that while a triple chainset will make climbing easier, that's not to say that climbing is not possible with just a double chainset. Far from it. You'll probably find that most seasoned cyclists (and all professional cyclists I think) will ride with a double chainset. So in summary in a place with occasional hills, a double chainset will probably suffice. But definitely worth considering the "compact" option too to give yourself maximum flexibility. Example The current Shimano Ultegra chainset comes in triple, double and compact variants. 

You will need to maintain: tyres, chain, brakes; less frequently, chain ring, freewheel (or sprocket); even less frequently, bottom bracket Their beauty is their simplicity. By all means get the kit to true your wheel, but that again is something that I'd lump in the "even less frequently" category.
