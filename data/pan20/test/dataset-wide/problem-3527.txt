Work Each Arm Separately Building on the previous tip, not all exercises are done with a barbell but that doesn't mean your arms are being worked evenly. Exercises like machine preacher curls and tricep pushdowns don't use a barbell but still work both arms at the same time which means that one arm can dominate. For these exercises, you should work each arm separately to ensure that one arm isn't doing more work. 

Weaker Arm First When working your arms separately, it's important to start with your weaker arm first. This way, you know when to stop with your stronger arm so you're doing equal work with each arm. The whole point of working your arms separately is to ensure you get an equal work out with each arm. If you do more with your stronger arm this defeats the purpose. 

Honestly not to be harsh, but I'd either commit to regular exercise or spend your time elsewhere. This "plan" will not accomplish anything. It's a recipe to get no where doing anything in life. Why not start of with 10 minutes every other day of light/moderate cardio to develop the habit and progress from there when you're ready. 

Your bunions and a "flat-foot" are CAUSED by over-pronation during running. It seems you were told the opposite. Flat arches and bunions on the base of your big toe is indicative of “over-pronating” (your foot everts or rolls inward). If you look at the tread on the soles of a pair of running shoes you’ve used for a while -- you’ll notice more wear on the medial side (or inside). As pronation puts pressure on the inside of your foot (where the painful bunion is) this pain could cause you to COMPENSATE or try reduce the pressure / pain by walking on the outside of your foot or supination. 

In grad school I did a study on the Postural Effects of Pain -- so I love these questions. There is so much going back there I don't have nearly enough info to give you an answer (there is no way to give any rational diagnosis with what is currently known) 

Specifically for me with "3", the flat barbell bench press, incline dumbbell press and/or the Hammer Strength incline press machine, and dumbbell flys. I never do all of this in a single workout. I also don't have a "chest day" (and there's a 99.9% chance you shouldn't either). 

Cool Down / Regeneration Spend a few minutes at the end of each working doing regeneration work. This is simply a restorative and pain reducing routine. 

Your deep abdominal muscles are primarily stabilizers. These muscles are primarily composed of Type I, oxidative muscle fibers. They're responsible for maintenance of body posture and skeletal support. As such, cellular changes will occur in these fibers. Hypertrophy (or growth) in your deep abdominal musculature will be negligible - as they're frequently activated for sustained periods. 

Again, there is two levels here, so that you aren't thrown straight in the deep end and can start where you feel comfortable Level one: Squat and hold Action: 

You don’t need to do abs exercises to get a strong core, or even a six-pack One big misconception about exercise is that you need to do abs exercises in order to get a six-pack, or even a stronger core. You can have a very impressive six-pack with a core as strong as steel by focusing on core, compound exercises like front squats with a barbell/dumbbell, dumbbell lunges, or even polymeric push ups to name a few. Another option is using stabilization exercises like an advanced bird dog exercise that works not just your abs, but your balance, lower back, and even arms and shoulders. 

Lie on the floor with the legs flat. Raise the affected leg and place that foot on the floor outside the opposite knee. Pull the knee of the bent leg directly across the midline of the body using the opposite hand or a towel, if needed until stretch is felt. Do not force knee beyond stretch or to the floor. Hold stretch for 30 seconds, then slowly return to starting position. Aim to complete a set of three stretches. 

“Consistent with the identification of changes in motor planning, there is compelling evidence that pain has strong effects at the supraspinal level. Both short-and long-term changes are thought to occur with pain in the activity of the supraspinal structures including the cortex”. “The overload principle advocated in sports medicine is a nemesis in the back. In other words, the progressive resistance strengthening of some core muscles, particularly the lumbar extensors, may be unsafe to the back. In fact, many traditional back strengthening exercises may also be unsafe” 

The condition described below is directly related to certain drugs including streptomycin and present nearly identically to what you've described. However other conditions cannot be ruled out. Again please get this examined right away. 

Just based on age, exercise response and the fact this piece of equipment is new to you - just keep working up your intensity. There isn't a "set time" per se. For now just stick to what you can do. As @rriower said as you progress you should look to start a regimented plan (based on your goals etc). 

Tip: If you get back pain doing this or hamstring spasm, try moving your feet in closer to your bottom -- this will likely make it easier. 

Body Fat measurements only changed 1% (seemly a small difference). It’s not. It also adds 7.4 lbs of "lean tissue" to the results. 

Kinematic Relationships Some pictures that show the chain of muscular imbalances associated with pelvic dysfunction. 

Work Each Arm Equally This is probably the most important tip. Some people try doing extra sets with their weaker arm or do more weight and more reps. This isn't a good idea. You should use the same weight for the same reps and same sets or else you may end up over training one side and under training the other. Select a weight that your weak arm can handle for the selected amount of reps and do the same weight with your strong arm too. Over time, they will even out. 

Last thing. I'm not sure how you're doing your weighted pull-ups (or dips for that matter) but holding a DB between your legs, especially if you're doing a weight over 45lbs IMO is the way to go (speed ease, no-in out delays / no annoyances etc...). I personally can't stand weight vest / belts. Good luck! 

Running During running, the body has an effective muscle work-minimizing strategy. Your lower leg muscles don’t propel you forward like during walking. Energy instead rebounds along compliant legs and unlocked knees. The leg and foot uses recycled energy for propulsion. As your foot hits the ground, impact energy is stored in the muscles and tendons are used to propel you forward. 

Fructose as fructose has different carriers than glucose, delivery of protein and therefore recovery and muscle growth has shown to increase when taken as part of a post workout drink. Sucrose - Simple sugars as your muscles are starving - refined sugars post workout spike your insulin allowing maximum delivery of protein. Water - to help deliver it all. 

Roll onto your side and plant your hands on the floor push your upper body up, so that your arms and straight Pivot onto your knees so that your hip comes off the ground – This will get you into four-point kneeling From there you need to bring one foot forward and plant it – from there you can drive up with that leg.

Working abs every day can lead to muscle imbalances Not only can working out abs every day lead to postural problems, but also muscle imbalances. Your abs complex, which is all your abs muscles are comprised of the rectus abdominus, transverse abdominus, internal obliques, and external obliques. If you do standard crunches 7 days a week for 300 reps, your rectus abdominus muscle (the six-pack muscle) is likely to get trained much more intensely than the other abs muscles. Doing a bunch of crunches does not necessarily translate into a strong abs, or a stable core. Even worse, if you do get your rectus abdominus too strong relative to your other abs and lower back muscles, you may be more susceptible to injury. While having nice abs is like the international sign of fitness, there are much more effective ways to work out your abs then to do a bunch of crunches every day! Source: $URL$ 

I would NOT take advice from a person trainer (no offense if any is a trainer). This is a condition very, very few will know enough about to give you safe recommendations. Most Physical Therapists have likely not treated this before. Therefore I wouldn't randomly pick a therapist as you'll likely know more about the condition than them. An Orthopedic Specialist is likely your best bet. However it's highly likely they also have not treated the condition before. 

Working abs every day is inefficient Having a six-pack is like the international sign of fitness, but working out abs every day is unnecessary. Let’s say you spend 10-20 minutes every day doing abs exercises. You could have spent that time doing high intensity interval training, stretching, foam rolling, and a lot of other fitness activities that would likely be A LOT more beneficial to your body and how it looks and feels. Spending 1 hour of your week working on one muscle group that is really a complex web of muscles is not a very good use of your time. My assumption is you are busy and you would rather spend that time hanging out with friends and enjoying your life! A better approach would be to work out your abs intensely 2-3x per week using circuits to get a great abs workout in much less time, which is what I personally do. While your abs muscles are most likely comprised of resilient type 1 muscle fibers that can take a beating without getting sore, just like training other muscle groups, they tend to respond better to less frequent training. A similar muscle to abs that has type 1 muscle fibers is your calves, yet you don’t see people doing calves exercises every day!
