This depends upon whether you intend to transfer the task to your teammate, or he's just doing the legwork, and you'll still continue with the customer interaction. If you are transfering the task to your teammate, you should send an email to the client explaining the situation, including your teammate as a Cc, with details about just what the problem is (so a followup to a client email is a good starting point). Basically, if you are bowing out, you owe it to both the client and your teammate to ensure that the three of you are on the same page about (a) what the problem is and (b) who is expected to solve it. An email from you to the client, informing him of the change, with a Cc to your teammate, does this nicely. I would not do the reverse, cc the client on an email to the teammate, because that makes it appear as if the client is secondary in this, and that's not the case. While the client doesn't have the option of declining this change, it is more than a courtesy copy -- it is absolutely critical that he knows both that you are no longer working on this issue, and who is. 

Try to have less than 4 targets you want to 'hit' during the presentation, and if you must add shortcuts that let you skip anything in the middle. Really widdle it down to what's most important to show. This also cuts down the number of targets you need to clear before 'forcing' the presentation forward if people ask questions or want to go back. If people are slowing you down on target 2 and you have 8 more things to show you won't make it. But if you're on target 2 and you're already halfway through it becomes much more manageable. The Question Phase: At this point, let the demonstration step back and take a more natural tone. Re-visit the earliest part of the demonstration, and intentionally slow down and begin re-treading what you've just gone over but leave massive openings for questions. The goal now is to smoothly transition from "demonstration" to "live Q&A". If all goes well you've managed to fit an introduction and your main demonstration in under 7-8 minutes. Now you've probably wanted to go into waaay more detail on just about everything, and here's where the magic happens: People will have questions! BUT! NOT! ANNOYING! QUESTIONS! If you structured your points well, you'll find people are asking questions to all the points you wanted to hit anyway. This will both be interactive, and you'll have almost scripted your audience in advance. You'll also look incredibly well prepared as you're literally continuing your initial presentation, but in a responsive manner. Because you've covered the broad-brush stuff people won't ask nitpicky questions either; you'll find the questions people ask tend to be just one level of detail higher than what you've shown. If you go into super-detail people will ask super-detailed questions. If you keep it basic, people will ask the moderate questions in line with the points you wanted to hit. In the end if there's other things you wanted to hit that weren't asked, you can always drop any last-second pointers as the presentation wraps up, after the questions have died down. Personal Note: When I used this format I was working with a group known to interrupt and de-rail presentations. I also couldn't handle a huge number of questions because the product I was presenting (a website) was completely broken and unfinished. This is compounded by the fact that if they saw how horribly unfinished it was we risked them losing interest and not selling it. Imagine presenting an online shopping cart... But there was no cart, no product pages, and only one "working" category. That's where I was at. By keeping back most of the detail the staff wound up focusing on the points I wanted to cover, and I was shocked that nobody realised they had never actually seen any real content. In the end they were surprisingly glued to the presentation. 

Yes it doesn't give a very professional impression especially for a senior employee. For a senior Employee in the UK 3 months is not unusual and as going from 1 months to 3 months you wouldn't stand a very good chance in court. If you need to leave most employees will offer pay in lieu any how so what is the main issue here. 

You need to talk to a lawyer or some one who understands TUPE, this can get very technical. If your bonus was contractual you should still have it - was this not covered during the consolation process. 

It means you only have a contact for a year The Guy in question probably Wanted a full time job A lot of employers are trying to get people to take short term contracts but only pay the full time rate and not the contactor one or in this case they may be trying to get around the maximum allowed probationary period (6 months). 

All recruitment agencies in the UK have to see proof of right to work in the UK - its not Identity they are verifying but your eligibility to work in the UK. They are using an EU passport to verify that you can legally work in the UK I have had to produce my birth certificate both for the agency and my employer. 

While counter-intuitive holding back information keeps it digestible, and when you do get questions later you'll find they'll closely follow the bullet points. Just because you put a bullet-point on a presentation saying you'll cover X doesn't mean it has to be scripted. This actually manipulates the questions into the presentation; if you know questions are coming - make it the questions you want. Then you'll be prepared and in control during the demonstration. The Demonstration People expect demonstrations to take longer, and whether you want them or not questions WILL eventually come: so what you want to do is cover the main points in the demonstration very quickly so by the time people begin butting in with their inquiries you've already hit the marks you've aimed for. Keep this step under 3 minutes, and treat it like the introduction. This isn't the time for detail yet. This is just showing your introduction again, but live. If you can, have the areas of your demonstration ready in advance. Don't explain, just show, and keep any description down to sound-bytes. If you can, write a 'micro-narrative' which people will mentally follow, such as the path a user might take though a system: "This is the online store, simple, clean. The shopping cart, and here's the checkout page." Don't rush this part though; even though you're moving quickly, you still need to keep it digestible. The main risk here is having someone in the room ask "can you go back?", which will kill all momentum and kick you into the main questions phase prematurely. If you have particularly impatient audience members who ask questions, take the question but try to use it as a lead-in for the next part of the demo. If I were showing a shopping cart and my next stop was the checkout here's how I'd manage the following; 

You could possibly join the TA (Army Reserves) it would depend on what country you come from if you can or not. 

So let me get this right you have a disagreement with your employer or with software patents in general and you seem to want to find way of damaging you employer by invalidating a patent? Its up to the patent examiner to do this this prior art may or may not invalidate the patent its nit your job to decide this. You do have a duty to your employer to be a good “servant” what you suggesting is very dubious and is in my opinion unethical – note I am a Union activist in the largest European union that represents scientific and technical staff I do not take the employers side lightly in this. 

For a DB Final Salary Pension you can estimate out what its worth by working out how many qualifying years you have in the scheme and at what rate you accrue (30th 40th or 60th are common) your salary and inflation. Obviously you have to take an average RPI. You can then compare this value to a DC scheme by working out how much you would have to invest to get the same income assuming the same rpi. 

You have two problems, a lack of good reference and a lack of references for online applications. While related, these are distinct problems. There's not much you can do about the first, you'll just have to live with it. He second in the other hand is a solvable problem -- references for an online application need not be the same references that get used if you are being considered for ajob. References are generally checked after a successful interview and just before an offer. Keeping that in mind, just ask a random co-worker if you can use them as a reference, when filling out the online applications,if they are gone in a month, no big deal just ask the replacement. The problem of no good reference, is a function of your work environment, the best you can do is use the people that know you the best at work at the time of the interview. Basically before you go to the interview ask the best possible references if they would be willing to be a reference. You might try to hunt up former co-workers and use them. 

That will be determined by the contract between the staffing company and the hiring company. Note that rewarding the staffing company for providing excellent workers will encourage them to continue to provide excellent workers. If I'm a staffing company and two companies want the same type of job filled and I have two candidates, the better candidate is probably going to the company that rewards me more. 

You need to work out what tasks need to be done as a result of the maternity leave and ask you boss which ones he doesn't want you to do. Make him or her make the Decision 

So they changed the T&C /Benefits between your offer letter and your joining? If the conditions where in writing I would talk to a lawyer about your options. Id view this as a breach of trust (if not contract) and would start looking for another Job. Basically this job is over and you need to treat it as such. 

What privacy is violated by using CCTV to check when they entered and exited the building the build or are at their desk or not? Employers do have a right to check up on hours worked and in some country’s not logging OT hours correctly can get the employer fined. What code of conduct for CCTV are you referring to? And its not like you have been asked to look at the content of their email account which would be a privacy violation. You seem concerned about your relationship with other employees is there a culture of falsifying time sheets at your company – what I might term “Spanish” practices. Just get all HR requests in writing and make sure you conform this with your boss. 

I recently did a presentation myself; I presented to our sales team who has the same reputation as your co-workers. I found what worked for me was to lay out the presentation into 3 steps; a brief introduction, demonstration and then transition into questions. When giving an introduction people will naturally allow the speaker to have the floor, and by structuring that introduction in the right way you can manipulate the entire presentation - including the questions. The Introduction Keep the introduction short, short as possible. I used a slideshow and it only had 4 slides and 40 words. The slideshow shouldn't be the star, either; all the slideshow is meant to do is serve as a mental indicator that you aren't to be interrupted. Some points the introduction should follow; 

Don't write your absence on your resume, your resume is meant to highlight your assets; any absence is best left for an interview question. It would also kill your resume since the writing explanations will read on paper like excuses - you're handing them your positive traits, not a doctors note. DO put your past careers on your resume. As per explaining the absence during an interview, be frank and direct. State that you had issue X, be truthful about it, and let them know that the position you've applied for is something you're confident you can contribute to. 

NO use ms word its the defecto industry standard and you want to create as little reason for HR to drop your CV as possible. A second reason unless you have access to acrobat/tools to properly create the pdf you run the risk of having a poor looking pdf 

I would put it down as Programmer with the Organisations Job Title in Brackets Programmer (Technologist) This is what I did for my first job where my Grade was Research Assistant and Later Experimental Officer. 

Yes a laptop is compromised in so many ways in terms of RSI and performance unless you are spending 70-80% of the time on the road out visiting clients a desk top is a much better choice (its also cheaper than the equivalent lap top set up). 

No culture develops over time and is overwhelmingly derived from the grass roots and the employees that make up the company modified by the culture these employees come from Senior management can attempt to change/modify culture but this is hard and can backfire. Sounds like you have been reading to many MBA case studies by HR professionals trying to make their role seem more important than it is. 

Use examples from your work experience where you have had to investigate a new technology or technique. E.g. the initial proof of concept was to slow for production so I investigated the possible solutions and taught my self node.js and rebuilt the system using that.
