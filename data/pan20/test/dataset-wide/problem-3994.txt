But the problem is, I cannot see this kind of Poincare duality in this book. I've looked for other texts with bundle theory, but other texts don't even seem they care much about compact vertical cohomology. So please help me with these questions. 

First of all, please excuse my English. I'm not native Englsih speaker, so you will see so many grammer mistakes, I just only hope that my mistkae wouldn't effect what I want to mean. Hi, recently I'm taking graduate course Algebraic Topology, with text Bott and Tu, "Differential Forms in Algebriac Topology." I think this text is really great, but I'm having hard time with some minor (I think) problems and details. By background in this field is just first two chapter of Hatcher's Algebraic Topology book. So I'm studying cohomology first time with this book. 

On page 63p. Can anyone give me the construction of homotopy operator $$K : \Omega^\ast_{cv}(M \times \mathbb{R}^n) \rightarrow \Omega^{\ast-1}_{cv}(M\times \mathbb{R}^n)$$ For type (II) case I found that $$\pi^\ast \phi f(x,t) dt_1\cdots dt_n \mapsto \pi^\ast \sum_i (-1)^{i-1} \left(\int_{-\infty}^{t_i} f(x,t) dt_i\right) dt_{1\cdots \hat{i},\cdots n} - \pi^\ast\phi\sum_i (-1)^{i-1} \left(\int_{-\infty}^{t_i}e(t)dt_i\right) \left(\int_{\mathbb{R}^n}f(x,t)dt_{1\cdots n} \right)dt_{1\cdots \hat{i}\cdots n} $$ But I don't know how to define this kind thing to Type (I). On page 75 Example 6.44.1, Finding transition function was not hard, But I don't know how to directly use equation (6.38). Isn't this equation only valid only when we reduced the structure group into $SO(2)$?. I cannot see how the function $g_{01} = z$ means rotating angle. I also want to know what dose integration of euler class over base space means. I think this is only possible if the rank of bundle is equal to the dimension of base space. Well, actually I found something in wikipedia and lecture notes that it is related with self intersection number, but I cannot find any published text book. Last question is about the motivation of compact vertical cohomology and its Poincare duality. When I first saw definition of deRham cohomology was not weird, which means, it as natural enough for me. But deRham cohomology with compact support was not to natural at first time. After I see Poincare duality on this book, the assumption 'compact support' seem to assumed to make interal well defined. I think this conclusion is fair enough because, at least until now, everytime when I faced with function with compact support, there was integral with it. When I first saw a definition of compact vertical cohomology, I thought we are trying to integrate a form in fiber direction, and that was exactly the flow of this book. But still, the definition was not clear to me. If we want to integrate a form in a direcion of fiber, why do we need a assumption that the form should have compact support on the preimage of compact set? So with this kind of view, the definition of compact vertical cohomology looked like we want to do integrate a form over preimage of compact set i.e. for a rank $n$ vector bundle over $m$-manifold $\pi : E \rightarrow M$ with compact submanifold $K^k \subset M$, let me denote $i: \pi^{-1}(K) = E|_K \rightarrow E $. Then with compactly supported in vertical direction form $\omega \in \Omega^{k+n}_cv (E)$ the integral is well defined, $$\int_{E|_K} i^\ast \omega.$$ While, the Poincare duality tells us there is some kind of duality between submanifold and cohomology. In this book, I felt that deRham cohomology let me know what kind of submanifold does the manifold have, in this moment let me assume the manifold is finite type and let me use the word effective submanifold. (I mean, circle in the sphere is not interesting one) Similarly, compact cohomology tells us what kind of effective compact submanifold the manifold have. Hence with natural generalization I thougth I can do this kind things with compact vertical cohomology. Above integral gives us an element in $(H^{n+k}_{cv}(E))^\ast$, so I guess there should be something about this kind of Poincare duality. 

Hi I'm stuck with the proof of a concentration-compactness lemma. We have the following equation in $\mathbb{R}^N, N \ge 3$: $$ -\Delta u +u=|u|^{p-2}u, $$ where $2 < p < 2^{*}$. The functional associated to that equation is given by $$ J(u) = \frac{1}{2}\|u\|^2_{H^1}-\frac{1}{p}\|u\|^p_{L^p}. $$ Because the Sobolev imbedding $H^1 (\mathbb{R}^N) \subset L^q (\mathbb{R}^N), 2 < q < 2^{*}$ is not compact, $J$ does not satisfy the Palais-Smale condition. So one considers the family $J_k$ of functionals defined by $$ J_k(u) = \frac{1}{2}\|u\|^2_{H^1 (B_k)}-\frac{1}{p}\|u\|^p_{L^p(B_k)}, $$ where $(B_k)_k$ is an open cover of $R^N$; $k$ positive integer. Each $J_k$ now satisfies the PS condition. The "lemma" says the following: Let $u_k \in H^1_0(B_k)$ be uniformly bounded in $H^1(\mathbb{R}^n)$, i.e. $\|u_k\| \le \Lambda$, with $\Lambda>0$ independent of $k$, and such that $J'(u_k) \to 0$ as $k \to \infty$. Then, along a subsequence, one of the following holds true: 

either $u_k \to 0$ in $H^1(\mathbb{R}^N)$, or, there exist $r,\delta>0$, and a sequence $a_k$ in $R^N$ such that $$ \liminf_k \int_{B_{r} (a_k)}u^2_k \ge \delta. $$ I know how to prove that if 2. does not hold then 1. holds. I need a hint on how to prove that if 1. does not hold then 2. holds. 

I decided to make my comment into a more detailed answer. When $M$ has an almost complex structure $J$, then one can talk about smooth complex-valued differential forms of type $(p,q)$ in the usual way. A complex valued $2$-form $\omega$ is type $(1,1)$ if and only if it satisfies $\omega(JX,JY) = \omega(X,Y)$ for all smooth vector fields $X$ and $Y$ on $M$. If $\omega$ is a real $2$-form of type $(1,1)$, which means that $\overline \omega = \omega$, and if we define $g(X,Y) = \omega(X, JY)$, then it is easy to show that $g$ is a smooth, symmetric bilinear form on $M$. So it is a Riemannian metric if and only if it is positive definite. This is the definition of a positive $(1,1)$-form (that the associated $g$ is positive definite.) The triple of data $(J, \omega, g)$, where $J$ is an almost complex structure, $\omega$ is a real positive $(1,1)$-form, and $g$ is the associated Riemannian metric as defined above together define an almost Hermitian manifold. Now the condition for $M$ to be Kaehler is that $M$ be complex ($J$ is integrable) and that $d\omega = 0$. (These two conditions can be packaged together as $\nabla \omega = 0$ or $\nabla J = 0$, where $\nabla$ is the Levi-Civita connection of $g$.) Hence, if one is starting out with a complex manifold $M$, together with a closed real $2$-form, the only additional condition required to ensure that it defines a Kaehler metric is that it be a positive $(1,1)$-form. 

It is known that, for $n \ge 3, 2 < p< 2^*$, the imbedding $H^1(\mathbb{R}^n) \hookrightarrow L^p(\mathbb{R}^n)$ is not compact. Let $G=O(n_1) \times O(n_2)\times\cdots\times O(n_k)$, with $n_1+n_2+\cdots+n_k=n, n_i \ge 2$, and $k \ge 1$. Define an action of $G$ on $H^1(\mathbb{R}^n)$ by $g.u=u\circ g^{-1}$, and denote by $H^1_G(\mathbb{R}^n)$ the subspace of $H^1(\mathbb{R}^n)$ which consists of the fixed points of that action, i.e. $g.u=u$ for all $g \in G$. Then the imbedding $H^1_G(\mathbb{R}^n) \hookrightarrow L^p(\mathbb{R}^n)$ is compact. The question is whether there exists a space $E \subsetneq H^1(\mathbb{R}^n)$, with $H^1_G(\mathbb{R}^n) \subsetneq E$, that is compactly imbedded into $L^p(\mathbb{R}^n)$ ? 

Let $(M, g)$ be a non-compact smooth Riemannian manifold of dimension $n \ge 2$, and $G$ a subgroup of the isometry group of $(M,g)$, say with $G$ contained in the component of the identy. Let $W^{1,2}_{G}(M)=\{f \in W^{1,2}(M)| \quad f\circ \phi =\phi \quad \forall \phi \in G\}$. Is there any known result concerning the compactness of the Sobolev imbedding $W^{1,2}_{G}(M) \hookrightarrow L^p(M)$ for some subgroup $G$? 

Let $\Gamma \subset \mathbb{R}^2$ be a closed simple $C^1$ curve. For every $x \in \mathbb{R}^2\setminus\Gamma$ there exists some $p(x) \in \Gamma$ such that $$ (H) \quad \text{ dist}(x,\Gamma)=|x-p(x)|. $$ Of course $p(x)$ is not necessarily unique. E.g. for $\Gamma=\{x \in \mathbb{R}^2:\, |x|=r\}$ and $x=0$, any $p(0) \in \Gamma$ satisfies (H). However, if $0 < |x| < r$, then $p(x)=rx/|x|$ is the only point satisfying $(H)$. The question is the following: Is it possible to characterize all closed simple $C^1$ curves $\Gamma \subset \mathbb{R}^2$ with the property: there is some $\varepsilon_0 > 0$ such that for every $\varepsilon \in (0,\varepsilon_0)$, and every $x \in B_{\varepsilon}(\Gamma)$, there is a unique $p(x) \in \Gamma$ satisfying (H)? where, for $A \subset \mathbb{R}^2$ and $\varepsilon > 0$, $B_{\varepsilon}(A)$ denotes the set $\{x \in \mathbb{R}^2:\, \text{dist}(x,A) < \varepsilon \}$
