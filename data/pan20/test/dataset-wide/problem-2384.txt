I'm looking for an accurate translation of "Satipatthana Sutta". Could someone let me know what is the best available accurate translation? I don't want to be confused by just reading all available versions. Thank you 

In five aggregates I'm bit confused when it says Perception and Consciousness are temporary . I can see form , feelings and formations are temporary by practice. Could someone provide me some more context to see this in practice ? 

You can always build your "worldly success" while practicing Buddhism. There is no conflict of each other. If you are talking about go the monastic direction and live like a monk, that's a totally different story. 

It was never about blind belief. It is about faith in the direction of the path. By the time you reach the path's end, faith is not required, because you already know. Without faith or belief, you would be on your foot, forever questioning about your own belief, without taking one step for eternity. 

Now I want to be aware about myself while being absorbed in reading or be aware about the reader while reading Could anyone provide me a guide to proceed to that ? 

What is the correct use of manasikƒÅra ( attention ) and Citta in the context of Mindfulness ? Is there any difference in terms of spiritual effect of keeping attention while I do daily works and keeping attention on breath with the mental recitation of "Buddho" ? 

Your Karma, good or bad, will depend on how you treat, raise, and teach your child. It is What you do with him/her, that will result in good/bad/neutral karma. Hence, by just bringing a child into the world, it is neither a good or bad karma, it is neutral. 

Work is merely part of life, not all of it. Recognize that this current society is ruled by people who designed money, material, etc...which is why we have to work for money to ensure a certain quality of life and 'keep the wheel rolling'. Remember, work is merely a tool for income to support life. Instead of hating work, it is better to think of how you could spend your life and make it meaningful ! Through work and your job, it is merely your stepping stone to achieve a higher goal. Putting Buddhism teachings aside, a common reason why people do not like their job is mostly because of the people and work nature. Think about what's causing the trouble, and make suitable solutions for it. 

What is the right mindset we should have towards physical exercises according to buddhist practice ? e.g. Weight training , cardio , running etc. In my case I'm spending most of my day sitting at desk , so having some exercise is necessary to be healthy . But would this consider as clinging to body? I can understand having supplements such as protein shakes could be considered as clinging. 

And I found "- When you are aware of the taste, knowing" is extremely momentary compare to other steps (relatively longer when having a beverage like coffee or soft drink) . Sometimes I miss that step completely . How should I handle "intention"(cetanaha) of eating without "suppressing"? 

Analyze it with a "Cause and Effect" rule. Once you find out the cause, analyze what are the root causes and why your negative minds are being triggered. Ask yourself some of these questions: Is it only you that are experiencing the Anger, or both? If both, is there some fundamental difference that can never be settled? If only you are experiencing this mind state, try position yourself in his/her shoes? Do your family members know? what are their thoughts? Is there a win-win solution? 

The life current is extremely strong, if I consciously bring my attention to a single breath, a single movement of my abdomen, a single moment of my weight or sensation of my sitting bones during daily life, would it still be beneficial to my inner transformation? Or is it long hours of (15min plus) sitting meditation, body scanning is only counted? 

Practice : Ven. Mahasi Sayadaw Is there any "Gatha" (Verse) can be used to contemplate on "Death"? The purpose is to use as an aid to generate necessary energy to continue practice [mostly as the first thing in the morning] 

To teach mindfulness is one thing; To teach the dharma is another thing. Supplementing my original comment to the question and simply put: If the corporation is unethical, anything/any means that supports this corporation, is unethical. 

In Buddhism there are concepts that are so complex that transcends beyond common reasonable, objective thinking. Therefore to your question, the answer is obviously "No". The question instead should be: Does common 'reasonable and objective' thinking downplay the depths of true Buddhism teachings? This will eventually guide you through your doubts. 

Practice - Mindfulness of body When I move attention part by part in the body I don't feel sensations in every part . Is this right ? Or should I feel sensations in all body parts ? Sometimes I do quick sweep of attention from head to feet . I do this at any moment during the day when I remember to be aware of my body . Would this be helpful for practicing mindfulness of body ? Or is there any better way of doing this ? 

Dreams are fragmentation/de-fragmentation of your memories. Memories are based on a combination of your worldly senses from eyes , ears , nose ,tongue, body , mind....etc. 

All relationships are subject to impermanence, just like all illusions. Also, the way you perceive a relationship, will always differ to the other person within that particular relationship. The relationship is merely 'true' only within your perception, which is also impermanent, just like an illusion.
