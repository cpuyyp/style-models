I lost 1.5 pounds a month for two years (because of my age, I was afraid my skin would sag and I'd lose muscle if I was more aggressive). It was easy. WebMD, Mayo Clinic's site, etc all have calculators that walk you through the process. My advice is that given a choice like 'somewhat active' and 'disgusting sedentary slug' always choose the most demeaning option. The best way, however, is the food diary. Weigh yourself right after your first pee in the morning every day and only eat foods with a posted calorie count (like a bag of pretzels or a frozen pizza) and record what you ate, when, and the calorie count. Do that for a week or two. It's not hard. A one pound gain or loss is 3500 calories. You may find that documenting your food caused you to eat better stuff and eat less often. To run my test I developed standard sandwiches and salads - nothing fancy. To my surprise, I never tired of them and found I just ate when I was hungry. I still keep my diary but now it's used to keep my weight up as I train. 

I've read that hip snapping with no pain is not a symptom of anything bad. My snap usually occurs as I get up in the morning and did go away with stretches. I learned this while diagnosing myself for hip muscle problems which turned out to be arthritis (diagnosed by a real doctor based on x-rays). He gave me the stretches. My point is that the snap has your attention but the pain can be from an unrelated cause. Before seeing a doctor again, keep a pain diary that leaves out the snap but includes all pains and your running activity. Get a doctor recommendation from other runners. Remember, trainers, PT's, experienced runners etc can only rule things in, only a doctor can rule things out. 

I've been training off and on for about 50 years now and have always tried to keep up to date with the best practices. Trust me - this is not an exact science, never has been, never will be, doesn't have to be. Get to the gym and try stuff, then you get more out of this site so you can try more stuff at the gym ... You'll always be modifying your workout as you learn and as the science develops. I (and Arnold and Steve Reeves, and Eugen Sandow) did lots of stuff that was proven later to be wrong, but so what? Of course @siebz0r is correct and of course you shouldn't start with 800 pound squats, but tens of thousands of satisfied customers didn't do the 'correct way' so don't worry and welcome to the club! 

The question as asked seems to be "can I trust a bodybuilder based on their appearance?" I would have to say no - too many athletes have been caught in lies over the decades. This includes unknown amateurs who lied to researchers to get gym time, physicals, etc. It's a serious problem for sport science. That said, you might be pleasantly surprised at what you will accomplish when you try. Remember, you don't really know your genetic potential, or your innate talent for effort. Finally, don't worry about suddenly waking up looking like the Hulk - worry about waking up one day and suddenly realizing that you're 50 pounds overweight with a bad back. The latter seems to be what's happening to most people. 

Eric Cressey uses these in shoulder rehab for pitchers. The idea is to limit the range of motion at the bottom which is stressful on the rotator cuff. After my rotator repair I used boards on the floor to accomplish the same thing with pushups (I have no spotters). Gym limitations often require odd lifts like the board press. For a healthy bencher with no fancy equipment but good training partners, this might be used to work on a sticking point. Many exercises have a position where your particular body runs into a leverage problem. In the picture his sticking point might be an inch above the boards. He'll press the weight an inch or so above that point and then lower it back to the board. The idea is to build strength at the sticking point. These guys have a power rack, so they might have been adding or subtracting boards as the set progressed (a kind of drop set). Adjusting pins or rack bars is too slow a process and requires a spotter at each end of the bar. 

Based on my experience with lay-offs ranging from weeks to years (I lifted my first barbell about 50 years ago). I think you'll be pleasantly surprised with how much anaerobic strength you'll keep and how quickly and easily you will return to personal bests. Aerobic ability fades quickly if you shift to full sedentary, but as @JohnP states, that won't happen. Most of my knowledge is based on research on men, but I haven't come across anything that says women are different. Shedding weight gained during inactivity became a problem only after 40. Sagging/loose skin became an issue after 60. To both of you, thank you for your service. 

The uber physical therapy expert Mike Reinold in his sport coach's seminars tells them they can only rule things in - only a doctor with the right equipment can rule something out. so I agree with @Meade while at the same time who can afford a real check-up? I don't like the sound of "my whole body" shaking. When I do weighted push ups with my feet elevated on a bench, my hips will shake just before failure on my heavy sets because the small synergist muscles are giving out. I know these are weak because I can't do hip airplanes very well despite my squatting strength. That doesn't sound like what's happening to you, unless all your synergists are weak. You might try backing off completely and looking for extremely wussy exercises (wall push ups) and see if that helps, but of course now we're playing doctor ruling out god knows what. 

It goes without saying (?) that these rep ranges are to some kind of failure. The idea is that failure occurs because some system is depleted/damaged and with rest it will be repaired and eventually strengthened. 1-3 reps is thought to stress out your neurotransmitters so you fail and the body's response is improved nerves and muscle recruitment that increases speed-strength (think Olympic lifting). The next system to go is internal to the muscle fibers (4-6). The body needs more strength. Then the energy stores within the cell are taxed at 7-12 - you need bigger cells (hypertrophy). Over 12, failure is lack of capillaries to remove waste products and bring in oxygen - you need more vessels maybe even bigger lungs. Of course there is overlap. 10 solid reps followed by 1 not so solid, followed by puking (not really necessary) will hit all the systems - some of that failure will be neuro, some a drained fiber etc. Thus the popularity of 8-12. The take-away is that at some point you'll start "programming" - spending time at each rep range to support the next. That's another topic. Is there a lot of hard science behind this? That's also another topic.
