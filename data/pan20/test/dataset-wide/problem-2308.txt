I know you said you were backpacking but you didn't specifically mention weight as an issue, so this answer assumes you'll trade some weight for comfort ;) The LL Bean Pathfinder Sleeping Pad is better than most mattresses I've slept on. I'm a smaller framed guy with bony hips and I sleep on my back and my side. My wife has larger hips and sleeps on her stomach and side. Most of our experience with this pad is on the hard floor of wooden lean-tos. The short version (the one we use, my shins and feet extend past the end) comes in at 22 oz though it does pack down fairly small. The full size is a whopping 34 ounces and packs quite a bit larger. It's a self inflating foam style pad so I assume others like it would be similar. 

I know an answer has already been accepted but I figured I'd chime in. Preface: I had an AWFUL pair of boots that aged terribly. They were cheap, general sports store off season specials. I don't know if the fit was wrong (I have very thin legs) or if the construction was just that bad, but the tongue would "float" to the outside on both boots after only a few runs, no matter how tightly I tied them, and always resulted in hot spots on the opposite side. My point is - when paying close attention to fit, don't just focus on how much room your toes have like with normal boots and shoes. You put a lot of lateral stress on the boot in all sorts of situations when riding, and the calve/shin/collar area needs to fit well and still be comfortable. Also a note about laces. The boots I ultimately purchased had a "quick lace" system where you pull on the two handles attached to the thin-but-strong laces, pull them back to lock into the grips and try to stuff the excess into the little pockets. It was obvious this is the trend, as that style along with the weird crank dial was the only option across multiple brands in the store in my price range. 

Tri-Cams have a reputation for fitting where other protection will not, and they are light weight and inexpensive compared to SLCDs. Unfortunately they also have a reputation for being hard to clean (remove from the rock) after being set. Therefore: 

Their protocol requires additional measures such as captive-eye carabiners, the reasons for which are detailed within that paper. 

Although technology has brought us many conveniences most of them require supporting power or other technology. You seem set on refrigeration and you say: "I am willing to go to just about any extent short of buying a fridge and a generator." Perhaps you should consider solar panels (photovoltaic) and an electric refrigerator. Both technologies are readily available and highly developed. Absorption refrigerators may be less so and they still need a fuel source. (If the refrigerator is well insulated it should stay cold over night if it is not opened.) A better alternative may be store things that do not require refrigeration, and even your examples are compatible with this: 

A quick search turned up these possibilities: Jaybird & Mais Sports Medicine Adhesive Tape (non-stretch) Many of the products say: Hypo-allergenic and 100% Latex Free This is not specifically described as climbing tape but the first product, EX1 JAYBIRD® ONE TAPE, says: "Our strongest everyday strapping tape product. EX1 is manufactured using a higher thread count fabric which results in greater tensile strength." It is currently available from Amazon.com Cramer 750 Athletic Tape "Cramer 750 is designed to provide high end performance at a budget conscious price. Latex free adhesive." I couldn't find a good single-roll price (shipped), but by the case from Amazon.com it is a fraction of the price of the EX1 tape. Marketing perhaps, but the EX1 sounds like a safer bet since Jaybird make several non-stretch tapes and the EX1 is "[their] strongest" and specifically says "Hypo-allergenic" rather than simply latex-free. 

Each species and possibly even each individual animal will behave very differently. A good rule of thumb is: if wildlife reacts to you, you are too close. I think this is the most general way to answer you question and has the benefit of giving you instantaneous feedback. If the animal looks straight at you, back off until it resumes what it was doing. The motivation behind this is the following: If an animal reacts to a human, it is likely to be stressed. A common reaction to stress is to flee. Either the animal is unable to flee, which will increase the stress which can make the animal sick if it happens frequently, or it takes off and wastes precious energy in the process, possibly leaving a juvenile behind. 

TL;DNR: It depends if you are backpacking or car camping. I have owned several mesh tents with windowless rainflies. I have not owned any tents with a "window" (an opening to the tent not meant for ingress and egress), though I remember them from my youth. The tents I have owned would all qualify as backpacking tents, meaning they where constructed with a focus on saving weight and withstanding wind and rain. If you see me lugging a tent around, chances are that I brought it to facilitate an extended stay in nature and I try to spend the least amount of time as possible locked away in anything with walls. If I expect a lot of rain I often bring a tarp in addition to a tent. Under the tarp I can cook and hang out. If I want fresh air during the night, I leave the rainfly-zipper of my tent open but close the mesh. I normally don't leave the rainfly off. If I don't expect rain, there is little dew and I am somewhere in the wilderness I normally don't even set up the tent. I could imagine use-cases for tents where having a window could be nice. If you bring a tent to a picnic to provide shelter from the sun or from rain, a window might be nice to keep an eye on the little ones. If you are planning an extended road trip and want an experience more similar to traveling by RV, a tent with windows might be nicer than a backpacking tent with a windowless rainfly. Tents like the previous two are probably not very useful for backpacking though, since they are likely large and heavy.

There is a lot more in the book, including information that may help you answer the bulleted points in your question, but I cannot quote the entire thing here. 

One of the authors of that book required that surgery so he writes from experience. See also the April 10, 2012 weblog of Pamela Shanti Pack: 

I have never used it and it looks bulky and rather expensive, but the LIFESAVER® bottle makes your third option otherwise practical. You fill the bottle from one end and get clean water from the other; it is capable of filtering biological threads directly so there is no wait period. Reviews I've seen are a bit mixed, but it does seem like a unique offering at this time. Here is a video presentation from the proprietor: $URL$ 

I have a bicycle helmet that fits well. Can it be used effectively as a rock climbing helmet? Most climbing helmets have a hard shell that the bicycle helmet does not. However, one of the more expensive climbing helmets, the Petzl Meteor III, appears to have the same construction of a thin plastic shell over foam as the bicycle helmet. The bicycle helmet clearly has better impact protection on the sides, with a thick layer of expanded bead foam that is absent on most climbing helmets. On the other hand most cycling helmets have vents on top that the climbing helmets to not. 

Google Earth can give you an elevation profile of pretty much anything. There are 4 ways to go about: 

This answer is purely complementary and does not attempt to answer the question directly. Another option for securing a rappel is the fireman's belay. This works on single pitch climbs when someone is at the base of the cliff, or on multi-pitch routs when someone is already at the next, lower anchor. The belayer takes a hold of both strands of the rope, while keeping in mind to give the abseiling person enough slack to smoothly feed rope through the rappel device. In case of an emergency, the belayer pulls the rope strands tight, which causes the belay device to lock up. I use this method whenever possible, since it is much quicker than attaching and detaching a prussic. It also eliminates the difficulty of resuming a rappel after the prussic has bitten down on the rope. In case of an emergency, the person below could safely lower the person rappelling, which is not possible with a self-belayed-abseil. These points make the firemen's belay the preferred method when helping a novice to rappel. Someone new to ropes, harnesses, and rappel devices can concentrate on the more immediate aspects (avoiding overhangs and jerky movements,) while the belayer takes care of the unexpected, and can take an active roll in lowering, if necessary. Some people swear by never even using a prussic, and instead lowering the first person off of the anchor, and then using the fireman's belay for the second. This methodology should only be used when lowering off of one's own gear, since the weight of the climber and the friction of the rope quickly abrades fixed rappel rings.
