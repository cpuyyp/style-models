$f(\lambda a) = \lambda^2 f(a)$ for all $\lambda \in k$ $f(a_1 + a_2 + a_3) - f(a_1 + a_2) - f(a_2 + a_3) - f(a_1 + a_3) + f(a_1) + f(a_2) + f(a_3) = 0$. $f(a_1^2 + a_2^2) = (f(a_1) - f(a_2))^2 + (f(a_1 + a_2) - f(a_1) - f(a_2))^2$ 

Let me just give a community wiki exposition of the example 6.38 that Professor Rosický mentions from his book with Adámek, Locally Presentable and Accessible Categories, since although the book is quite clear, it doesn't quite reach the conclusion needed here, since the point of the example is slightly different. Consider structures $X$ with partial unary operations indexed by the ordinals $\{\alpha_i\}_{i \in \mathrm{Ord}}$ such that the following condition is satisfied: 

No. Let $X$ be the topologist's sine curve, i.e. $X \subset \mathbb{R}^2$ is $\{0\} \times [-1,1] \cup \{(x,\mathrm{sin}(1/x)\mid x \in (0,1)\}$, and set $K = \{0\} \times [-1,1]$. Let $f_t$ fix $K$ for all times, while $f_t(x,\mathrm{sin}(1/x) = (x_t,\mathrm{sin}(1/x_t))$ where $x_t = \min(x,1-t)$. Then the homotopy $(f_t)_{t \in [0,1)}$ satisfies the hypotheses but $X$ is not homotopy equivalent to $K$ -- for instance $K$ is path-connected but $X$ is not. 

Maybe I have this wrong, but I think that in $\mathcal{DK}$, filtered colimits at least are constructed in the following way. Let $I$ be a $\lambda$-directed poset for simplicity, and let $G: I \to \mathcal{DK}$, $i \mapsto G_i: D_i \to \mathcal{K}$ be a functor, with transition maps $(D_{ii'}: D_i \to D_{i'}, \gamma_{ii'}: G_i \Rightarrow G_{i'} \circ D_{ii'})$ for $i\leq i'$. Let $G_\infty : D_\infty \to \mathcal{K}$ denote the colimit of $G$. Then we should have $D_\infty = \varinjlim_i D_i$, so an object of $\varinjlim_{i \in I} D_i$ is an equivalence class $[(i,d)]$ where $i \in I$ and $d \in D_i$. And $G_\infty$ should be given by $G_\infty([(i,d)]) = \varinjlim_{i \leq i'} G_{i'}(D_{ii'}(d))$ (where the colimit is of a diagram constructed using the $\gamma$ maps; this colimit is $\lambda$-directed). Now suppose that $F: C \to \mathcal{K}$ is such that $C$ is $\lambda$-presentable, and $F$ takes values in the $\lambda$-presentable objects of $\mathcal{K}$. A map $F \to G_\infty$ will consist first of a functor $f: C \to D_\infty$; this data commutes with the colimit because $C$ is $\lambda$-presentable. Secondly, there will be a natural transformation $\mu: F \Rightarrow G_\infty \circ f$. In components this consists of maps $\mu_c : Fc \to G_\infty(fc)$; the data of this component commutes with the colimit because $Fc$ is $\lambda$-presentable. The data of the whole natural transformation then commutes with the colimit because $C$ is $\lambda$-presentable; I'm not sure how to argue this conceptually, but it follows from the idea that a $\lambda$-presentable category is generated by $<\lambda$-many morphisms subject to $<\lambda$-many relations. That is, $F$ is indeed $\lambda$-presentable, with slightly weaker hypotheses than requested. It's interesting that standard results about presentability and fibrations like Makkai-Paré Theorem 5.3.4 don't seem to quite apply here. 

Of course, not every coherence result is of the form mentioned in (2) -- the simplest counterexample is symmetric/braided monoidal categories where the symmetrizer/braiding can give rise to multiple canonical coherence maps between the same object. It seems to me that the coherence cells of a lax morphism satisfies a pretty simple coherence theorem which is of this form. But as soon as one's lax morphism is interacting with other sorts of categorical structure -- for example if one considers a lax monoidal functor between symmetric monoidal caetgories -- things may become more complicated, and more specificity might be needed. 

There is a zero object $0$, i.e. an object which is both initial and terminal. Every pushout square is a pullback square and vice versa. 

Proof of Observation: In $\mathsf{Set}$, every morphism except for the morphisms $\emptyset \to S$ where $S \neq \emptyset$ factors as a split mono followed by a split epi. But in $M$, every split mono and every split epi is an isomorphism. So the restriction $F|_{\mathsf{Set}_{\neq \emptyset}}: \mathsf{Set}_{\neq \emptyset} \to M$ of $F$ to the category of nonempty sets factors through the localization of $\mathsf{Set}_{\neq \emptyset}$ at all morphisms, which is the terminal category. Now the coproduct $2 = 1 \amalg 1$ is preserved by $F$. The two coproduct injections $1^\to_\to 2$ are exchanged by an automorphism of 2 which is sent to the identity by $F$, so the two coproduct injections are the same map $F(1) \to F(2)$. This implies that for any object $X \in M$, there is at most one map $F(1) \to X$. But by adjointness, maps $F(1) \to X$ correspond to elements of $X$. So every object of $M$ has at most one element. Moreover, $F(\emptyset)$ must be an initial object. This, along with the universal property of $F(1)$, implies the first bullet point. If $U$ is faithful, this means that $M$ must be a poset, with $F(\emptyset)$ a bottom element $\bot$. By its universal property, $F(1) = \min(U^{-1}(1))$. Moreover no element of $U^{-1}(1)$ is below an element of $U^{-1}(0)$. Conversely, any poset and functor $U$ meeting this description have a left adjoint $F$ meeting this description. 

For example, the total relation $1 \to 2$ and the graph of your favorite function $1 \to 2$ fail to have a coequalizer in $\mathsf{Rel}$; see here for a proof. See also the Milius paper linked to by Martin Brandenburg above for an example of an $\omega$-chain which doesn't have a colimit in $\mathsf{Rel}$. Thus we "reduce" the question of why $\mathsf{Set}$ is "more fundamental" than $\mathsf{Rel}$ to the question of why limits and colimits are so fundamental to category theory. Loosely, I'd say that limits and colimits are to category theory as universal and existential quantifiers are to logic -- without them, you're simply very limited in the kinds of things it's possible to say at all. An object $X$ of a category $\mathcal C$ is studied by looking at the set of possible "measurements" $\mathcal C(X,A)$ by objects $A$, or dually by "probing" via the set of maps in $\mathcal C(B,X)$. In category theory, we get a lot of juice out of the fact that these two ways of looking at an object $X$ are quite different, and we can play them off one another. But in a self-dual category like $\mathsf{Rel}$, you can't tell the difference between the object doing the measuring and the object being measured -- it's like there's feedback in the measurement process. Everything is simply too jumbled together to make sense of the data you're recording. To mix metaphors some more, $\mathsf{Set}$ is like a cleaner operating room to work in than $\mathsf{Rel}$, or an experimental environment where more of the environmental variables are well-controlled. 

Accessible, accessibly-embedded, weakly-reflective full subcategories $\mathcal{L} \subseteq \mathcal{K}^{[1]}$. Accessible, accessibly-embedded full subcategories $\mathcal{L} \subseteq \mathcal{K}^{[1]}$ which are closed under coproduct, pushout along arbitrary morphisms of $\mathcal{L}$, composition, transfinite composition, and retracts. Full subcategories $\mathcal{L} \subseteq \mathcal{K}^{[1]}$ of the form $\mathcal{L} = {}^\perp(\mathcal{C}^\perp)$ for some small set $\mathcal{C} \subseteq \mathcal{K}^{[1]}$ 

Alternate formulation of the question (I think): What's a precise version of the statement: "In a stable $\infty$-category, finite limits and finite colimits coincide"? Recall that a stable $\infty$-category is a type of finitely complete and cocomplete $\infty$-category characterized by certain exactness conditions. Namely, 

I'd be interested in the answer for any algebraic notion of $n$-category, and any $n$ with $2 \leq n \leq \infty$. If there's a way to formulate / say something about this for non-algebraic notions of higher category I'd be interested too. (Of course I'm not suggesting that every weak $n$-category is equivalent to a strict one -- the cofibrant replacement in question lives a category level higher!) 

Dimension is multiplicative: $\dim(C\otimes D) = \dim(C) \dim(D)$ for $C,D \in \mathcal C$ dualizable. $\dim(C) = \dim(C^\vee)$. If $L\in \mathcal C$ is $\otimes$-invertible, then $\dim(L)$ is invertible. 

Let $R$ be a semiring and $Mod_R$ its category of modules. That is, $R$ is a monoid in the monoidal category of commutative monoids and $Mod_R$ is its category of modules in the usual sense. Question 1: For which semirings $R$ does $Mod_R$ have enough injectives? Question 2: Which subvarieties of those of the form $Mod_R$ (with $R$ a semiring) have enough injectives? Of course, if $R$ is a ring, then $Mod_R$ has enough injectives. But the category of commutative monoids $Mod_\mathbb{N}$ does not have enough injectives; the injective objects are still the divisible abelian groups, and a commutative monoid embeds into one of these iff it is cancellative. The property of having enough injectives is not actually useful if these injectives can't be used to form resolutions, so I'd be most interested in an answer about having enough regular-injectives (an object is regular-injective if it lifts against regular monomorphisms, and there are enough of them if every object embeds into a regular-injective via a regular monomorphism). But it appears that the question of having enough injectives in the usual sense has been more widely studied in the literature. In particular, results of Kearnes come very close to answering this question, since he addresses both congruence-modular varieties (which include subvarieties of $Mod_R$ where $R$ is a ring) and varieties of semigroups (roughly $Mod_\mathbb{N}$). So I'd be interested in an answer addressing having enough injectives in the usual sense, too. There's apparently a general answer for all varieties, but I'm hoping one can be a bit more explicit in the specific cases I'm asking about. Actually, Kearnes shows that a congruence-modular variety (every congruence lattice is modular) has enough injectives iff it has amalgamation and is residually small (i.e. has a cogenerating set). Module categories over a ring are congruence-modular, but the category of semigroups, and thus probably many other module categories over a semiring, are not. So I'd also like to ask: Question 3: Which varieties of the form $Mod_R$ with $R$ a semiring are congruence-modular? Question 4: Which varieties of the form $Mod_R$ are residually small? But if Question 1 alone is answered, I'll accept and repackage the rest of these into another question. EDIT: A word more about the "general answer" I linked to above, leading to a partial answer to Question 1. The general answer says in particular that if a variety has enough injectives, it must have the "congruence extension property": any congruence can be extended along any monomorphism. For any module $M$ over a semiring $R$, we can formally adjoin additive inverses via the usual fraction construction to get a "groupification" $M \to M[-\mathbb{N}]$. The kernel of this map consists exactly of the (additively) noncancellative elements of $M$, so if $M$ contains a cancellative element, the image $M'$ of $M$ under this map is nonzero. Then there is a quotient $M''$ of $M'$ where we identify $2m$ with $m$ for every $m \in M'$. The kernel of this quotient consists of the elements of $M'$ with additive inverses. As long as there is an element of $M'$ without an additive inverse, the congruence generated by this equivalence relation does not extend to $M[-\mathbb{N}]$. So if there is a module $M$ containing a cancellative element without an additive inverse, then the congruence extension property fails. Moreover, this happens if and only if the unit map $\mathbb{N} \to R$ is injective and does not extend to $\mathbb{Z} \to R$, since in this case we can take $M = R$. So if $R$ does not satisfy a "uniform idempotency" law $nr = (n+1)r$ for any $n \in \mathbb{N}$, then $Mod_R$ has enough injectives if and only if $R$ is a ring. But I'm not sure what to do in the idempotent case. Although, the "congruence extension property" seems to have a lot to do with the fact that classically one looks at injectives rather than regular-injectives, so this is a bit unsatisfying. 

In light of the comments below, I suppose this is really several questions. Let $X$ be a quasi-projective variety. I would like to know what can be said about $X$ in each of the following situations. Conversely, I would be interested in conditions weaker than the ones noted below which guarantee one of the following properties. 

Side note: I personally find the new definition both much cleaner and much more transparent. I'm still puzzled about the motivation of the old definition. 

If $\lambda, \mu$ are regular cardinals, say that $\lambda \trianglelefteq \mu$ if $\lambda \leq \mu$ and $$\forall X, \, |X| < \mu \implies \mathrm{cf} (P_\lambda(X)) < \mu$$ Here $P_\lambda(X)$ is the poset of subsets of $X$ of cardinality $<\lambda$, and $\mathrm{cf}$ takes the cofinality of a poset. Then $\trianglelefteq$ is an $\mathrm{Ord}$-directed partial order on regular cardinals which is strictly weaker than the ordering by size (by $\mathrm{Ord}$-directed, I mean that any set of cardinals has a $\triangleleft$-upper bound). For instance, $\aleph_1 \not \trianglelefteq \aleph_{\omega+1}$ but $\aleph_0 \trianglelefteq \mu$ for all $\mu \geq \aleph_0$. This relation comes up in the theory of accessible categories, because the following are equivalent when $\lambda \leq \mu$ are regular cardinals: 

Question: Is every topological operad structure on the symmetric sequence $P$ of the form $\circ^f$ for some convex homeomorphism $f: [0,1] \to [0,1]$? Guessing the answer is "yes" is motivated by the characterization of quasi-arithmetic means. Background: The operad $(P,\circ)$ features explicitly in Leinster's operadic characterization of entropy, and twists $(P,\circ^f)$ for certain $f$ are used by Baez, Fritz, and Leinster to characterize certain deformations of entropy. Certainly these operads are implicit in countless mathematical pursuits. Explicitly: The fixed data is the sequence of topological spaces $(P_0,P_1,\dots)$ and the $\Sigma_n$ action on $P_n$ (this is called a symmetric sequence, though you might also call it a topological species). An operad structure on the symmetric sequence $P$ is a monoid structure for the substitution monoidal product. That is, it consists of continuous operations $\circ: P_n \times P_{n_1} \times \dots \times P_{n_n} \to P_{n_1 + \dots + n_n}$ for each $n,n_1,\dots,n_n \in \mathbb N$ satisfying:
