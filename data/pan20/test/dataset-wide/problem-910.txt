TL:DR - The language has been carefully chosen to cast doubt on Rodolfo's adulthood and masculinity Eddie is a traditional, older, blue collar dock worker with a conservative attitude to masculinity and the role of men in the family. Rodolfo, his wife's cousin, is the opposite. He is young, liberal and harbours wild dreams of a singing career. Eddie has also developed an infatuation with his wife's young niece, Catherine. Rodolfo and Catherine develop a relationship and, eventually, begin dating. This further strains relations between the two men. Here, Eddie's language is denigrating Rodolfo, trying to cast him as young, foolish and dangerously irresponsible. Furthermore, he is trying to convince himself that Rodolfo is homosexual. He is implying these things without saying them outright by his patronising choice of language. 

Digging through the history of Owen's Battalion, the 2nd Manchesters, reveals that the likely action took place on the 14th of April. The troops were ordered into an attack on a trench complex on the western side of St. Quentin in northern France. To reach the jump-off point, the soldiers took a long march during which they rested in the shade of a hill. 

And Then There Were None was originally published in 1939 at the outbreak of World War 2. The author adapted for the stage in 1943 when the war was at its apex. According to Hilary Strong, CEO of "Agatha Christie Ltd" who manage the rights to the author's work, theatre producers at the time felt that in an atmosphere of such bleakness, there was no appetite for a play with such a bleak ending. 

Arnold Wesker's play Chips with Everything is an examination of class attitudes in Britain through the window of the armed forces. In one scene a group of conscripts sing the peculiar English folk song Cutty Wren. This portrays a group of unlikely characters discussing the hunting, killing and eating of a small bird in bizarre detail, ending with an exhortation to "give it to the poor". The origins of the song are disputed, but one theory dates it back to the Peasants Revolt, with the wren standing in for King Richard II. The originator of this theory, A. L. Lloyd is known to have been an acquaintance of the playwright. In the play, the song is sung by a group of conscripts, but the stage directions state they are to sing each verse with increasing aggression. What is the significance of this song, and the style in which it is sung, in the context of the play? 

Given that he wore his heart on his sleeve when it comes to his opinion of other authors, if Wells had been an major inspiration, we should expect to see mention of him in Lovecraft's correspondence. In fact he does tip hat to Wells, but only once in his famous essay "Supernatural Horror in Literature": 

That is overworked and unnecessarily complex and melodramatic, the very epitome of "purple prose". Over time, memory of the full opening sentence has been lost and all we recall is the opening few words which have come, unfairly, to be held up as the archetypal example of "purple prose". 

So, the "vast, vulgar and meretricious beauty" is something impressive but ultimately empty. Prior to making this statement, the author indicates that the biblical undertones here are to be taken literally. Gatsby's self-image is that of a "son of God", so his "Father's work" means the work of God. The implication is clear: that Gatsby's ego is so huge as to believe himself to be divine. Fitzgerald may have taken this striking metaphor from the work of philosopher Ernest Renan, whom he is known to have admired. Renan's book, The Life of Jesus, posits the idea that Jesus was a historical figure who invented himself as the son of God and became so invested in his self-deception that he allowed himself to be crucified. This is not dissimilar to Gatsby's life in the story. The key difference between Jesus and Gatsby here, however, is that Jesus wanted to spread a positive message of peace and love. Gatsby, however, creating himself in his own image, is instead spreading an empty "meretricious" message which appears superficially attractive but contains nothing of value. The text does not make clear that he's spreading his beliefs, but the religious overtones still suggest a certain level of proselytizing going on. This can also be read as a metaphor for the corrupting influence of capitalism. Ancient society looked up to religious ideals of self-improvement. Modern society worships only the tawdry business of acquisition. A quest for genuine self-improvement has been replaced by one in which the show of making the effort is more important than the outcome.

According to Wikipedia (which cites a slightly dubious source that I can't verify), Stevens felt the message of this song was "uplifting" and he has called it an "optimist's anthem". This song was, of course, written before his conversions to Islam but as Morning Has Broken suggests he has been religious all his life. In the bible, St. Paul advocates that all Christians should keep "faith, hope and love. Indeed, Moonshadow contains other religious themes: 

These sorts of lines, together with the mystical nature of the lyrics, imply that uncertainty is a key part of living. The woman is "sure", she "knows" that she can buy her staircase and will "get what she came for", yet the tone of the song suggests she is wrong. Not only can you not buy happiness, but there is little which is certain in life. Consider, then, some more individual lines: 

As paper thins and fails so does human skin, withered with age. In spite of all our power, we cannot escape mortality. A final thought. Light is an omnipresent feature throughout the poem. Light is often used as a metaphor for the ultimate power: the divine. In the poem, this power is never answered to directly, it simply exists. 

It is interesting to note that she appears to have based the new ending on the fact that the rhyme which inspires the play has two alternative versions. The original uses the ending: "He went and hanged himself and then there were none." Whereas the stage version is based on the concluding line: "He got married and then there were none." This is mentioned by the author in her autobiography. Here, she gives another reason for the change of ending (emphasis mine). 

The statement is also a direct rejection of two other interpretations of history that have been pressed upon Stephen. In the first chapter, Haines says: 

My question is this: not being familiar with the overwhelming majority of historical styles employed, it is not clear to me whether or not the incomprehensibility of the text is a consequence of the style it's mimicking? Or to put it another way, could Joyce have attempted this literary history lesson while leaving the text easier for the reader to follow? 

"Paper" - even paper so aged and feeble that it can't stop light - has the power to "alter things". The people who control what is written, published and read are in control of a great deal of power, the power of information. 

No one knows, but it is likely a joke at the expense of the Prioress. There are, as you have observed, multiple ways of interpreting this text. It could be that Parisian French is radically different from the scholarly French taught at "the school of Stratford-atte-Bowe". It's not hard to imagine that the sanitised French taught in an English convent could be quite different to the rough dialect spoken on the streets of Paris. It could also be a matter of accent or skill: that she can recite genteel phrases but cannot actually converse or understand real French. Given the multiple interpretations and the distance in time from the authorship of the text, we can never know for certain what exact meaning Chaucer intended here. However, we can infer what his intentions were. Whatever the interpretation, the Prioress - alongside many other religious characters - is held up in the Tales as a figure of mockery. She breaks a number of rules of religious life, yet clinging to the mannerisms and rights her station gives her. She also has a habit of aping courtly ladies, which is not befitting to the role of a prioress. Given this, whatever is wrong with her French it is clear these lines are poking fun at her "achievement" in trying to speak it. Indeed it may be a double joke. Not only is she taking on airs by claiming a useless skill, but since French was, at this point, the language of the English court, her having learned it at all may be another example of how she is imitating aristocratic manners in place of focusing on her religious role.

The short story The Legend of Sleepy Hollow by Washington Irving has remained extremely popular. Wikipedia lists 24 film and TV adaptations including the well know Tim Burton film and, perhaps more unsurprisingly, 19 musical works inspired by the story. It is not long and available in the public domain if you want to read it. I have just done so and was surprised to find it very ordinary. The writing is charming but veers to the purple in places. And the tale itself is spun well enough but lacks anything in the way of originality. First published in 1820 it thus shares an era with titans of gothic horror such as Shelley and Poe. They too, of course, enjoy ongoing fame: but their imagination and originality would seem to warrant it. What qualities does Sleepy Hollow have that it has remained so popular alongside them? 

Chapter 12 of James Joyce's Ulysses, Cyclops, consists mostly of a first-person comic narrative of men drinking in a pub. The conversation is frequently interrupted, however, by a number of deadpan pastiches of varied style and length. Some of these I understood - there are passages mocking spiritualism and Irish nationalism, for example - some I failed to interpret. What interested me, though, is that some of these pastiches contain long lists, usually of names. They are so long - a page or more - as to be awkward and rather pointless to read. Here's an example, chosen at random - and one of the shorter ones, at that: 

There are all motifs of hope: birdsong, the west (where the sun rises), the spring, time for change, time to join. In particular the very end of the song is packed with messages of hope: 

And, as you might expect, the windows are usually covered during the wake. Hence: "pull down the blinds". Mirrors are also traditionally covered, although a window may be left open in the room where the corpse is resting. Of course, the line also has symbolic meaning. "Pull down the blinds" is suggestive of closure, of an ending: it is an act undertaken at the end of each day. It takes place as dark is closing in, and brings further darkness, shutting out all outside light from the room. Hence it is, as a phrase, a powerful euphemism for death. 

The first of these, in particular, would seem to me to suggest that the tale should be taken at face value, depriving it of much of its mystery, impact and value. Is this a deliberate clue left by the author as to the narrator's reliability, and if so, why is it there? Or is there another way of interpreting this information which leaves the mystery intact? What other clues can we glean from the text about the truth of the narrator's tale?
