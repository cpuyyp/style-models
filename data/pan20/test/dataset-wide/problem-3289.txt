Historically, the typical modals form a grammatical category known as Präteritopräsentia: They have past tense form, but present tense meaning. Even in Modern English the lack of an -s ending in the third person singular is a remainder of this inheritance. The verb "will" is historically in a category of its own, but joined the other modals in the Germanic languages. 

As you already sketched out, it is a difficult question. Usually (e.g., in the OED) the age of a word in a certain language is defined by its first attestation. This works well for the large part of vocabulary that was introduced rather recently. Only for the core words of the language that are inherited from ancient times, different methods are needed: Reconstructions of proto-languages, time estimates when those proto-languages were presumably spoken, evidence from archaelogical findings (e.g., what technologies, domesticated plants and animals were available at what time) all play a role for dating those words. 

You can find some information about phoneme inventories (separated by consonants and vowels) in the WALS survey. WALS has also surveys about some phoneme features, e.g., presence of unusual consonants in Chapter 19. 

As @sumelic already explained, there is no historical relationship. The use of "u" instead of "µ" is an artifact of English-only character sets like ASCII. "u" is visually close enough to "µ" to be treated as a replacement. I know the usage specially from the short name of the MicroVAX II computer uVAX in the mid 1980's. The use of "u" or even "U" instead of "µ" for the micro- prefix was sanctioned by some ISO standards dating back to early 1970's (See the article on Micro- on Wikipedia). 

To long for a comment ... Which Swedish verb do you mean? What languages do you read comfortably? When you are lucky, there is a paper (published in a journal or in conference proceedings) on that specific word. The draw-back is that this paper is probably completely unreadable for a lay person, because it uses terminology defined in other works (to be consulted) and is written in a very dense style.. When you even luckier, the word was deemed important enough to be treated in a grammar of the Swedish language. (Don't think of schoolbook grammar with conjugation tables, think of a work ten times as thick.) In this case, you may even have the chance to understand something of it. However, for most of the words of the Swedish language, such kind of in-depth analysis will be not available at all. 

It definitely is a part of speech, but (in usual analysis) not in the first level of analysis. In the U PENN tagset (that does strange things to part-of-speech sometimes), all -ing forms of a verb are lumped under the tag : It is primarily analysed as a verb, and secondarily as carrying the ending -ing, it is not properly separated from the present participle of the same surface form). Other tagsets may analyse it as a noun primarily. 

Nevertheless, simple palindromic syllables occur and some frequent words (like English a, did) are examples of them. 

/ts/ is, as you already noted, the standard German pronunciation of the letter "z". This applies to loan words from other languages, including classical Greek, too. It is not unusual that words mainly learned by reading (instead of hearing them) are pronounced according to their written form. The English pronunciation of Latin and Greek loan words has nothing to do with their original pronunciation in any variety of Latin or Greek—it follows the spelling. 

The main issue with GermaNet is that it is not an open ressource. You have to licence it (free of cost for noncommetcial academic research, but you need to sign a licence agreement) from Eberhard Karls University Tübingen. Licensing details can be found on the GermaNet home page Alternatives to GermaNet can be found in the Open multilingual wordnet or within babelnet 

When you cannot find an Open Source implementation of the Gunning-Fox index, do it yourself. After all, the formula is not overly complex (though counting sentences and counting "complex words" can be tricky). 

The design of Ido indeed intends to make it more similar to modern Romance languages (so French is a fair—but may be polemic—pick). This includes phonology (abolishing the letter ĥ), derivation using Romance suffixes, introduction of more "international" words (hospitalo for malsanulejo, olda for maljuna or malnova). Ido failed community-wise: it wasn't the next version of Esperanto everyone wanted to adopt. For fans of more naturalistic international languages, (IALA) Interlingua is the choice for a contender of Esperanto. 

My guess is that it started as a kind of joke: Diminish the word "diminutive" by taking away one letter and you get something smaller—the iminutive. BTW, stacking diminutive endings is not uncommon in colloquial German, you can have up to four of them in an ending like "-ileinelchen" composed of "-i", "-lein", "-el", and "-chen". 

Chinese dictionaries have arranged characters according to radicals for several centuries, then sorting on next level according to number of strokes. Works when you're looking for the meaning or pronunciation of a character you just saw. Some dictionaries and encyclopedias also attempted sorting by "theme": animals, plants, metals, etc. Of course, works only if you know a word and are looking for how it's written. The canonical list of radicals is taken to be that used in the Kangxi dictionary, presumed to be one of the most complete dictionaries ever made on Chinese logograms: $URL$ For Japanese I can attest the problem is solved via kana: when searching the kanji for a word you know, they're ordered according to the sorting of kana (aiueo, ka ki ku...) . When you look instead for a character's meaning or its pronunciation, though, they also use the radical + number of strokes method. As a foreign learner, you're in for some surprises for some characters' official stroke steps are not what you could intuitively think of :) 

This touches me on a personal level for I've tried hard my whole life to get rid of my accent, only to be told time and again I still have a strong Hispanic accent. I've learned a few interesting things on the road, though: 

Common knowledge of writing in a society can and does have an effect on the language structure, and it's been noted: There's this Israeli linguist (I've forgotten his name) who says so-called Modern Hebrew isn't really a Semitic language... he argues in one of his books how Chinese writing has had a profound effect in the language, by altering the way new words are created and how borrowings are adapted. I vaguely remember Saussure mentioning in a sentence in one of his books "I've been told people in Paris now pronounce the 't' in 'sept' ". I found that really odd, for I had been taught uttering "set" was THE correct way to pronounce 7 in French. So clearly Parisians of his time were adopting an artificial pronunciation based on spelling, which then was declared the standard. 

I recall that in ancient Egyptian some hieroglyphs were used "markers" to resolve ambiguity or indicate a noun was a member of a special group, even though not meant to be pronounced. E.g. a beetle sign was placed after a group of signs denoting a bird's name to indicate such noun was meant to be read as a "flying entity" (i.e. really a bird's name) and not as a person's name. There were other characters used to emphasize a noun was a person's name, and names of gods and royalty were inscribed within special cartridges. Are these signs a kind of punctuation, or mere typographical conventions? Do they have a formal name? They do transmit information, furthermore, information that's not a merely a verbatim transcription of what the actual speech said but actually expands it. Similar to when some printed media add a small cross after a person's name to indicate they're dead. Emoticons play a similar role in modern electronic communications - they expand the written message, though in this way to compensate the loss of emotional information that in face-to-face communication is transmitted mostly via physical gestures, and to a lesser extent in verbal channels that are not written down: intonation, volume and pauses in the speech. 

I was under the impression that all languages are considered isolates until it's demonstrated to a high degree of certainty that they're related to another language. Was I wrong on this? There've been various attempts at linking Korean to Japanese and Ainu, on one-hand, and to the Turkic-Mongolic languages on the other. Should the proponents of one of these efforts succeed, then Korean would stop being classified as an "isolate", which really means "not enough data to accurately say if it's related to something else or not". 

I once read there are a few other examples of sexual diglossia in the world, some other tribes in Africa and the Amazon, and they usually arise just like the Garifuna: when a bunch of men from one tribe/ethnic group pick up girls from a different one as wives, and for some reason neither group completely abandons their tongues. Some African tribes even added a 3rd language to the mix: the "warriors' language", used only by men in times of war to avoid an enemy's eavesdropper to understand a meeting on strategy or the discussions in mid-battle. 

For Japanese at least, both happened: sometimes the characters are used semantically, others phonetically - either according to their Chinese pronunciation (which can come from either a Northern or Southern, earlier or recent form of Chinese) or to the Japanese reading. For instance, one of the Chinese readings of the char. "origin/beginning/birth" is "hon". Now then, the Japanese word for "book" is also "hon" (don't know if its native or a Chinese/Korean borrowing). So instead of adopting the Chinese char. for "book", the Japanese use "birth/start" phonetically most of the times when they want to write "book". When char. for "now, immediately, contemporaneity" appears right before the char. for "sun/day", that specific case is a semantic usage: both together are meant to be read "kyô" (today). That for isolated chars. themselves. Japanese nowadays uses the chars. according to its own structure (SOV), in the very first examples of Japanese writing there's vascilation between trying to follow the S-V-O structure of Chinese or the native one. There's a lot of vacillation also regarding how to phonetically encode words in the vernacular. In A. C., Moorhouse's book "History of the alphabet" I read that something similar happened when Babylonians adopted cuneiform writing from the Summers, and then again when the Hittites adopted cuneiform from the Babylons. So, in a Hittite sample of writing, a set of chars. can be read in Hittite, in Babylon or in Sumerian, depending on context!!!
