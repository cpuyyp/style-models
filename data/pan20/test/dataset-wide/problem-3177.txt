The most common approach to class, especially class conflict in the, is a Marxist approach. Marx took a cyclic view of history from Hegelian "thesis antithesis." he ultimately viewed the synthesis of the thesis, bourgeois, and the antithesis, proletariat, in to a Marxist communist state. Postmodernist are also extremely class conscious, dealing with Deconstructionist and Poststructuralist movements.The most prominent Historian to come out of this was Foucault. The new left, although not as theoretical, was still highly class conscious. This era of historians came out of the Vietnam conflict and the Cold War. The new left was critical of class interests, but also social and diplomatic interests. 

These years are typically referred to Newton's "Golden years" due to the quantity and quality of his works during those years. Newton's Mother and Uncle managed the farm through out Newton's life. During the plague his family would have taken care of him, like provide him food clothing and shelter. His family knew that he was an "absent minded farmer" which is why his uncle initially sent him to Cambridge to study. 

The jews do not prolyselytes at all. In fact, originally, Yahweh, is Jewish national god. Jewish scripture almost never claim unambiguously that Yahweh is god of all beings. He never complains about non jews worshiping other gods. The Chinese, the mongol, have their own supreme God. So why jewish God suddenly got 3 billions followers while other gods don't sell. 

Look at internet. No barrier of entry. So google grab all the niche. It's things like that. Now look at your local store. Why they don't expand all the way to Arab? The answer is something called barrier of entry. It's just as costly for google to expand to your neighbor than to Arab. So they expand everywhere. Your local coffee shop doesn't have that luxury. The same goes in China. No mountains means there is no barrier of entry for the most disciplined, smart, meritocratic king to expand everywhere else (it's really a bad thing but does sound positive). In Europe, they got mountains forcing kings to maintain niches. China contains plenty of land. In business term, there is no barrier of entry for those with lower marginal cost to expand to new territory. Europe is mountainous. Say I am winning. I may have the best army. People may fear me more. It costs less for me to screw others than for you to fight against me. But alas, all these mountains is hard to travel. The peasants don't talk my language. In other word, in Europe, defender got more "home territory" advantage. In china attackers have about equal advantage with defenders. Note: Well, the case of three kingdom period in China where China is NOT united, actually supports my point. Cao Cao cannot conquer Sun Quan precisely because there is a river that gets in the way (or so simplistically said). So natural state boundary often coincide with hard to pass terain. Europe has more of it than China. 

Most likely they did not know how to count, except for the very basics, such as counting on their fingers and adding up small values. In the middle ages mathematics had a heavy foundation in arithmetic, and therefore the Ph.D. in Mathematics would be roughly equivalent to a third grader's homework today. Since academics and education did not have a emphasis in the middle ages, most people would not have explored number theory (even a most "primitive" case of coming up with zero). The monks, aristocracy and other educated people would have used the clumsy Roman Numeral system. Most common people were illiterate so they did not write down numbers, and did not understand numbers or number systems. 

From what I have observed professional Historians seek to create a narrative that explain specific events that are recorded. For instance one of my professor's looks at the social status females Jews in Perugia during the Middle Ages. She is seeking to tell a story that represents them, their beliefs and views. Also she looks at what external factors shape their world, like geography, climates but also how Christianity would have influenced their lives. Many historians understand that the discipline of history is purely speculative, nothing definitively happened, because the past theoretically does not exist. Historian look at primary sources, and secondary sources and try to answer different questions, new questions, and even propose new claims, about what might have happened. The Essential Historiography Reader by Caroline Hoefferle, and Why bother with History? Ancient, Modern and Postmodern Motivations by Beverly Southgate are both excellent sources that I highly recommend to any one looking to ask the bigger questions about history. 

English noble titles, even when related to a geography, did not have the same connotation of domination over a geographical area that continental titles did. Thus, in 1450, the Duke of Norfolk had castles in Norfolk, but also in Wales and in the north of England. He was expected to respond to his sovereign's call and go wherever he was needed. He was not responsible for the administration of the shire of Norfolk; it was more important that he be able to project power into Wales or to the Scottish border. For military men, the title is meant to commemorate the location of an achievement, rather than to indicate possession. 

In addition to the reasons already given above, the South also believed that Europe could not survive without Southern cotton. At the beginning of the war, Southern merchants organized a cotton embargo to provoke Britain to enter the war on their side. However, Britain had sufficient stocks of cotton to last a year, and was already working to develop alternate sources of supply in Egypt. The overwhelming support for the Confederacy that southerners expected in Britain never materialized. 

Looks like we just got to repeat this same karma wheel again and again till we are enlightened enough to know the truth. 

Lack of appreciation for free market culture. Government intervention in economy. Genocide against the best and brightest. Religion Lower average IQ (this is not that serious) Trade restriction Centralized economy 

Free market leads to prosperity Prosperity leads to cowardice (late Sung, contemporary US). I am too rich to die. Cowardice leads to dictatorship or socialism or other form of heavy oppression (heavy taxation in US, socialism in europe, mass murders in Kamboja). This lead to poverty (Yuan dinasty, communist countries, sub mortgage crisis). People got fed up they fight for freedom. Starving means they don't fear death anymore (Early Ming, American revolution, french revolution, capital flight to Asia, tea party movement). That leads to free market capitalism. Free market leads to prosperity. 

So, how much faster? Is this mainly due to alphabeths or different techniques? By how much both printing press improve economy? 

This supports the claim that there was a significant awareness of the coup in Iran during the seventies and the fall of Mossadeq was attributed to the fight with the West over oil. The book identifies several Western motive forces: 

Thus, even before the overthrow of the Shah in 1979, the big picture was available to be known. However, there was limited interest in the story in the US at that time. Most public attention was focused on the Cold War and people in the US tended to see any opposition to US policy as the operation of proxies of the Soviet Union. 

The U-boat of WWI was not nearly the weapon that it became in the next war. Holger Herwig documented the limitations of the U-boat in his book The First World War: Germany and Austria-Hungary 1914-1918. U-boats were primitive and prone to various failures. The means of radio communication with a submerged vessel were still underdeveloped. Germany had no answer for the convoy. The Germans did not have the resources to fight a two-front war and build an effective submarine fleet. In 1917 they were only able to keep at most 30 subs on station west of Britain at any time. The German U-boat did not threaten the British lifelines. Herwig documents the countermeasures that Britain implemented, including rationing and setting insurance rates to prevent a breakdown in world maritime trade.
