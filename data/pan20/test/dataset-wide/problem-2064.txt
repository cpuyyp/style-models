Where is your supervisor? It can't be the project managers. Somebody above all of you should set the rules about who you answer to. Document your accomplishments and review them with your supervisor. He is the one who ultimately decides if you are getting the right things done in a timely manner. Make everyone aware of the problems with the interuptions. That's why you only work on one project in a given day (Not arguing this is the ideal solution, but it is one way to manage interuptions.). If I was your manager, I'd tell the PM's to check the schedule and don't interupt once the day has begun. I would take serious issue with anyone accusing my people of not working long enough hours (You mess with the cubs, you get the mamma bear.). When we lose quality develpers because of the burn-out due to 12 hr days, I'm the one that has to replace them, not the PMs. 

It doesn't seem like you are taking into consideration the current tasks that are prioritized higher than the security issues. Look at what you are currently being asked to do and get some feedback on why they are so important. Even if you didn't have the security flaws, you should still know this. Learning to respectfully ask why is important to your development as a programmer. Make sure they understand you're not trying to get out of work, but want to see the "bigger picture." Sometimes you have to use a buzz-word to get their attention. Who knows, you may learn that if you don't get the next release/patch out, your largest customer is going to drop your product which may force the company to close. Most decisions have a risk involved. You need to understand the risks behind the current decisions. 

Don't limit your interactions with people to just this aspect of your job. Let them get to know you personally and professionally and not just this "void" that only shows up with bad news. I'm sure there's more to you than that. Also, see if you can do your reviews and presentations in smaller chunks. No one wants to hear the 50 things they did wrong, when you could point out a few and they could correct many others, especially if they're similar problems. This may not fit in with the company's development process, but could be worked in. 

It sounds like your manager is a very busy person with limited time to address your issues. Don't hesitate to ask again. Sometimes it's the only way to get busy people to make time for you. When you get some one-on-one time, bring this up in the conversation. Do they mind if you follow-up and ask again? What is a reasonable amount of time? If something is pressing, should you indicate that in your request? Many organizations and teams should probably try to address these problems without taking the manager's time. People are reluctant to document and delegate. I like managers who are willing to do some of the grunt work, but not at the expense of being available when I need them. 

You should consider defining what he means by good and okay. For some people, this is all you're going to get out of them, so start interpreting it as you're doing great. The key is to make sure you're getting constructive feedback and a valid response. Follow up with questions on how you could have done things differently. If your work is for customers or people in other departments, try to find out what there response is to your work. Some bosses are better at this than others. Don't forget to thank your boss and let him how important these things are to you if you can ever get him to say it. He needs reinforcing too. 

I think for the first meeting or so, it was smart to take notes and remain quiet. You should know how things work. It's better to remain quiet and people think you don't know what is going on, than to open your mouth and prove it. Taking your boss's feedback into consideration, if you have a comment, recommendation don't hesitate. Definitely ask questions to help your understanding. Hold a separate meeting with other team members who may or may not attend, so you are all on the same page. You don't want to be contradicting each other in the meeting nor do you want to have to return to the next meeting and withdraw an incorrect recommendation that could have been avoided by consulting your team initially. This is what your team is for. This is a great opportunity to have a voice in the project and some control over the requirements and expectations. Often some would will suggest a "nice to have" feature and by the time it reaches the development team it turns into "If we don't implement this immediately, everyone is fired." You can be a great service to the team by being involved in these meetings. 

Review any email about positive comments, "Thanks for getting this to me with such short notice". This is why it is a good habit to follow-up with people when you do something (I realize this could get too tedious). Ask if that was what they wanted (accurate). Indicate where you "added something" when you send it. If people offer some praise on your current job, it's a good indicator you'll do good work on your next. 

There's no guarantee a 3 year project was seen through completion or if you were involved during the initial planning stage. Usually dates of employment are given to help identify gaps along with the amount of time spent there. The dates of individual projects within a given job doesn't tell me what I would really want to know. 

What is the dress code? Will you have to work with clients? How high up in the firm are the interviewers? 

It's possible you're being invited as a courtesy to you so you don't feel left out. You could feel like you should be able to decline the meal in this case. If you're crucial to working with clients, you may want to consider another approach. Instead of having a total boycott of the restaurant due to the incident you had, try to get them to be more honest about meat in their meals. Maybe you can talk to the waiter on the side and not in front of your group. Ask about "true" vegetarian options and let them know you caught them in a lie. Sometimes when you're with a group that frequents a place, you have a little more leverage. I realize this won't account for the other flaws you find in the quality of their food, but it is a start. Don't let them get in the way of your career. 

As a fresher, I think you're making the general mistake of not knowing what is expected of you and equally important, how do you know when your boss thinks you're performing as expected. This takes time. You have to observe and ask questions. Pay attention to your boss to find out what he thinks is important. Good bosses should make this very obvious to you, but sometimes they need our help. You could be worrying about nothing. Who knows, maybe these new people are actually training your boss in R. They could be working on something completely different from you. Because you're being left out, you're looking at this negatively, so you interpret their behavior as being "high and mighty." Are they suppose to act like they're the lowest life-forms on the planet who are accomplishing nothing after these meetings? They could be a bunch of jerks, so make sure you are not being left out by finding out if your boss thinks you're doing your job. Ideally, you would be getting so much gratification from your work, you won't even notice the meetings. Work with your boss to get more feedback and get it more often. Follow-up on work you turn in. Wait a day and send an email asking if it was what he wanted. Good waiters do this with every customer. If someone says the food was fine, but they hardly ate any of it, a good waiter finds another way to ask the question to help probe deeper. Sometimes we get so caught up with the technology, we forget we're servicing people. They have emotions and personalities and sometimes we need to make them feel comfortable. They don't always have the technical skills to get it from our work alone. Show you care by paying attention and finding out what is important. You never know, it may have nothing to do with the meetings or the three new guys. 

Your relationship and the personality of your partner are going to determine "how" to ask him about this, so I don't think I can give you any help there other than be open and honest If I were a serious about a business and a partner was considering some other "distraction", I would want to know what he will do if we notice a conflict. To address this you need to A) establish a set of guidelines on the level of your participation you're going to maintain. B) Get some level of assurance you'll quit the job if it doesn't work out. You may not be able to make this commitment or convince him otherwise. The only solution in this case is to break the partnership. Your partner may be willing to settle for less (Doesn't sound like it). Find out what his biggest concerns and fears are and make an effort to address them. There are no guarantees in life, but there are ways to cut risks. 

I would be more concerned with taking a job and moving to a location that may not be a good fit. Most people are put off to a certain extent when offerings are declined. Some people and cultures more than others (Going to my grandmother's house and not eating; well, I never saw anyone turn her down.). Hopefully, you're doing your homework before going on this interview and taking this position. Unless you're being offered food that you may be allergic to or is against your religion and you're such an introvert that you're going to have a panic-attack, I would accept this offering. Are you comfortable enough with your "introvertness" that you openly use it as a reason to not socialize? If so, stay true to yourself. At some point, if the company has a problem with this, you may not want to relocate for this job. I realize this is just a question post, but I'm not feeling your pain on this one. You're considering a very far location. If every new experience is going to make you uncomfortable, this may not be for you.
