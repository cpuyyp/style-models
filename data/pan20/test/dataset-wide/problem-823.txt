If you're big enough and fluid enough, like an atmosphere, you would feel acceleration do to the Earth's motion. Hadley cells are patterns of warm air rising in the tropics, flowing north, and sinking at higher latitudes. The Earth's rotation causes this north-south flow to curve, causing storms to have that distinctive spin you see in in hurricanes. Alternatively, if you are an exceptionally long pendulum, you'd try to oscillate in the same plane. However, the Earth's rotation would make that plane appearto rotate with respect to the surface of the Earth. Called a Foucault pendulum, it was the first proof the Earth rotates visible from the surface. 

Asking what they would do if they existed and if they had capabilities is really the realm of science fiction. There can be no good answer to your question at this time. Maybe later we'll know, maybe never. 

"Life" seems to be an emergent phenomenon, a complex result of a very large number of simple parts or interactions. The whole is more than the sum of it's parts, unpredicted by the properties of the individual parts. If those individual parts are atoms and molecules, they have to move to be able to interact, to build larger, more complex structures. To move, they need to be suspended in something that permits movement and allows chemical reactions. On Earth, that would be liquid water. Other liquids might work, but they'd need to allow for the movement and reactions life requires. It's hard to imagine something other than a liquid doing the job. 

In all these years of listening, why hasn't SETI detected anything ? Is there no intelligent life out there or is it too far away to detect ? 

If an Asteroid, the size of the one that killed off the dinosaurs , passed by very close to the Earth but still remained outside of Earth's atmosphere, would it cause any damage ? 

Stars give off light and are visible at nighttime but Planets do not give off light . So why are Planets visible at nighttime ? 

Does the Earth receive any heat at all from the millions of other Stars in our Galaxy ? Is it light that is bringing the heat and perhaps it cools down on the long journey in Space getting to the Earth and that's why no significant amount of heat is getting here ? 

So I read that if an astronaut travels at the speed of light and goes to a nearby star system , when he or she returns, he or she will have aged 10 years but 1000 years will have gone by on Earth. Travel at the speed of light is not achievable ,so I was wondering if the spacecraft was traveling at an achievable speed of 10% the speed of light , how much will the astronaut have aged and how much time has elapsed here on Earth upon the return of the astronaut ? 

"What happened before the Big Bang" is like asking what Alexander the Great's phone number was. It's a nonsensical question. Space and time began with the Big Bang. "When" and "where" began with the Big Bang. 

Kepler did know the orbital period of the Earth, Mars, Venus, Mercury, Jupiter, and Saturn. He had access to observations going back centuries, including Brahe's most excellent data. What couldn't know was the absolute size of the Earth's orbit, so the best he could do was give the size of the plantets' orbits in terms of the Earth-Sun distance, 1 A.U. Nobody else could do better for centuries. Using the transit of Venus across the face of the sun, timing the instant the edge of Venus "touches" the edge of the Sun from two different locations on Earth a known distance apart makes a parallax measurable, and the absolute distance between the Earth and Venus a matter of trigonometry. Kepler's Law lets us convert all the other relative distances into absolute distances. I believe it was 1769 when this was first accomplished. 

Today I heard on the radio that the Super Collider has discovered mini black holes. They said that this discovery is proof of the existence of Parallel Universes and that the "Big Bang" never happened.I don't understand this and why this discovery means that Parallel Universe exist ? Does anyone know ? 

Can there be any truth to the rumour that the Apollo Moon landing in 1969 was staged ? I dismissed this rumour as being nonsense but today on the news I was surprised to hear that the head of the Police in Russia is calling for an investigation concerning this . Why does this rumour that it never happened persist even today ? 

Is Earth the perfect place for life ? If it isn't then how could conditions be better here ? For example, the size of the Planet, our atmosphere, distanace from our Sun etc. 

I heard on a you tube video that a new theory came out in 2015 . The theory is that there was no "Big Bang" and that the Universe has no beginning . 

An object hitting the Earth at high speed has a lot of kinetic energy, \begin{align} \frac{1}{2}mv^2 \end{align} where m is the object's mass and v is it's velocity. If the velocity goes from lots to nothing relative to the Earth, that kinetic energy has to go somewhere. That somewhere ends up as heat. 

It's hard to say without some research, but I don't think the answer really matters much. Both constellations are chance alignments that have little or nothing to do with how close the stars really are to each other. It's not hard to envision a constellation composed of a few nearby stars and a few galaxies millions of light years away. 

Time does not pass slower near a black hole. Stay-Home-Sally far from a black hole observing Astro-Bob descending into a black hole would see Bob's time passing slower as Bob neared the event horizon, but Bob would not experience this. On the contrary, Bob, looking back at Sally, would see time pass faster for her as he neared the event horizon. Who is right, or is time relative to the motion of the observers? 

There's a minimum size for the formation of a black hole by gravitational collapse of a star and it's larger than our Sun's mass. There is, however, no theoretical minimum for the size of a black hole if you can make one some other way. 

Given the huge number it's hard to imagine not one of those binary systems being, for all intents and purposes, near identical stars and even near identical G-type stars. The only really similar stars in a binary system I'm personally aware of are Mizar Aa and Mizar Ab. These are A-type stars, not G-type stars, but they illustrate the idea is possible. 

That's meaningless. All light is electromagnetic radiation. A finite part of the infinitely large range of the electromagnetic spectrum is visible light. So you should talk about EM radiation and to discuss the visible spectrum just say visible spectrum. Stars emit lots of energy at frequencies that are outside the visible range. 

If Space is expanding between the Galaxies then why isn't it also expanding between the Stars within the Galaxies as well ? In fact why isn't Space expanding within our Solar System ? 

So I got this information from a magazine , Scientific American issue Physics at the Limits. The theory is that our Universe came about, when in the "Bulk Universe", which is four dimensional, a four dimensional Star collapsed and formed a black hole which became our 3 dimensional "Brane Universe", in which we live. My question is, how could this one Star have contained all the material that is in our Universe ? 

Since any form of contact, would be next to impossible, because of the distance involved, I think the only importance of such a discovery would be for our curiosity . 

In the television show " Ascension " they are supposed to be 50 years into a 100 year journey to another Star System but get this, they never left Earth . They are here on Earth in a huge biosphere . My question is if this is possible that people can be here on Earth and not know that they are not traveling through Space in a Spacecraft ? How could they not have instruments or any other way of not knowing . This plot seems a little far fetched to me, what do the rest of you have to say about it ?
