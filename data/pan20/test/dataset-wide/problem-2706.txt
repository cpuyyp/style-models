To make this a solid argument you need to tie in the missing step; you would need to show that the process that forms the sentence is conscious. At best all you've convincingly argued for is that it is caused by conscious experience in a semantically relevant way. 

The argument above isn't meant to be taken seriously (see the passage); it's simply an example of how "a few questions" can reduce "the rest of mankind" into "hopeless confusion". 

I don't think the outcome really matters much with respect to free will per se. Choice per se extends to the point that we as agents initiate an action with a desired goal. A father might jump into a freezing lake to try and save his daughter; this doesn't mean he forsees a future of him saving his daughter, or saving his daughter is actually possible. Since there's not really any difference with respect to the agent per se, it would seem like if actually saving his daughter's life counts as a choice then merely attempting to should as well. Now the outcome does indeed matter to us, but all we can do is try. Being a potent agent requires such things as attempting to model external reality as best we can, attempting to train our own capabilities to acquire skillsets we can use, and learning our own capabilities and limitations. We could, however, model this as an idea leading to an action, where action is a goal based behavior. We could also model the action leading to an outcome; it just doesn't seem relevant to free will mechanics per se. 

The past does not exist (it may have existed in the past, but it's now gone) The future does not exist (it may at some point, but it doesn't now) The present, however, does exist. The present is just an instant; it has no duration. (Just rephrasing "within the present there is no lapse in time?"). By 1, 2, 3, and 4, the only thing that exists is this present instant. That implies that time (i.e., "the passage of time") does not really exist (because there's no room in "the only thing that exists", that being an instant of time, to have such things as "flow of time"). 

This isn't entirely correct. For free will as we think of it to be viable, we must allow for external influences. If the guy at the counter offers me vanilla or chocolate, I must appeal to my mastery of the English language to comprehend his offerings; my learning of English is in large part an external influence. It's also very likely that I'll be strongly affected by my preference of taste; this requires at some point in time access to gustatory memories of tasting each, which is an external influence. Pretty much all experiences I refer to and skillsets I invoke are set at least in part by external influences. What you're referring to here is only a specific class of external influences; those that compel actions. What exactly constitutes a compelled action is an unresolved issue. Here are three perspectives: 

I'm new to philosophical studies, my background is in mathematics. I've just read some of Aristotle's Metaphysics today, and would like critique on a brief argument I wrote against Plato's Forms being anything other than of substances. Here it is: Plato's Forms must be of substances, for that which is a Form of that which can be predicated of a subject, such as "Wisdom", is not an essence of said thing. For the Form in which Socrates participates is "man", but wisdom is predicated of Socrates, as is "good" predicated of "wisdom", and, transitively, of Socrates (it is thus implied that Socrates partakes in both the Forms of "Good" and "Wisdom"). But transitive predicabilty cannot be asserted in the theory of Forms, for it is absurd to say that the essence of any man is "good"; it is the plurality and interconnectedness of Plato's Forms that ultimately leads to their demise if not considered as Forms of substance. Thus Forms, if they exist, must be of substances only, since, if not, anything that can be predicated of the Form in which the substratum participates (say, the matter of Socrates in the Form of "man") can equally be said of the substratum (i.e. that Socrates is "good" in essence), due to the logical assumptions of "essence". Namely, if the Form of the substratum participates in a further Form, the essence of the secondary Form must be the essence of the essence of the substratum, and, consequently, the essence of the substratum. If this sort of predicabilty is admitted and we argue that Socrates has "good" in his essence but also "bad", since "bad" can be predicated of, say, "irrational behaviour", then we arrive at a logical stalemate, for it is not proper to give something contradictory essences; what is the essence of a thing should not bring about essences that disallow each other. For this reason, it seems apt to adapt Aristotle's general theory in Metaphysics BK. I CH. 9, $991^a$, that the relation of participation confers to the partaker a substantial nature. Ergo, the Forms should be reduced to the essence by which something is recognizable, whatever that may be. One would have to clarify what is meant by \emph{recognizable} to establish such a theory, for in modern science it would seem ``events'' to be the only needed Form, as used in physics to describe matter and energy. In the Ancient respects, however, "man" may seem most correctly the Form the substratum which produces a substantial man by participation in this Form. Predicable phrases seem not to belong to Forms, but more generally to a class of Universals. This class of Universals, we may separate into Forms and Essences in the sense of Plato, and also linguistic universals which do not give rise to substance, but are predicated of a Form that, through the substratum's participation, gives substance. Now, we touch upon such Forms as "round", "straight", and "equal", and discuss why they need not be valid Forms as they are too temporal to act as the essence of some substratum, and too flighty act as the Form which provides the partaker with a substantial nature. For the issues of plurality and interconnectedness that give rise to the shortcomings of Plato's theory also apply to pertinent Forms such as these. Suppose one has two earthly pieces of string laid on the ground of equal (in the best of man's ability) length. A rational man may deem that the two strings partake in both "straight-ness" and "equality". If the wind blows one such string remarkably into the shape of a semi-circle, the affected string now partakes in "round-ness", and the two strings cannot be said to partake in "equality" (though the Form "equality" is absurd altogether, since it is relatively asserted, i.e. one may assert that two things are "equal" in that they both have been seen by one's eyes). The temporally-caused shift from "straight-ness" to "round-ness", as a continuous change, is not able to be handled by Plato's Forms. For how can the essence of something be that which is possibly ephemeral and possibly deformed into its contrary? If these such pertinent qualities are admitted as primal Forms that confer a substantial nature, then it is possible of most any object to at one time have as its essence one quality, and at another, the contrary. This continuous change implies that there is a Form of the substratum that undergoes said motion, attaining all such intermediate essences as "curved", and this Form is therefore more primal and essential to the substance. Accordingly, we should not admit those such as "round" and "straight" into the class of Forms and Essences, but in the linguistic universals that do not confer substance. As such, we have shown that, if Plato's Forms are to exist, they cannot logically exist in the plurality in which he has set them forward, but must be further separated in a manner of linguistic analysis. Any comments welcome 

This possibly creates another false equivalence, though it's a bit ambiguous. If you're arguing that it's okay to bully a homosexual/mock an employee's eating habits, if you could in addition catch the bully/mocker, then I'm curious what sort of ethical system you're employing. I don't see how catching the bully/mocker with the same technology erases the harm to the homosexual/employee. Surely not having harm done in the first place is different, and preferable, at least to the affected party who should for that reason have some say. If you're arguing that nobody who is recorded would want to bully a homosexual, or mock an employee, then you're living on a different planet from me. The notion that the bully would suppress his behavior while being recorded but the homosexual should be unaffected (i.e., free to show affection) while being recorded is extremely naive. It also misses the point; this is a risk assessment issue. Whereas you're not the one facing the potential harm in this scenario, it's not up to you to assess the risk on behalf of the potentially harmed party. 

Equating an event that happened in public to having a recording of an event is a false equivalence. An event in public can be witnessed live by people who happen to be there. By contrast, a recording is an artifact that grants its possessor the ability to control to whom, whether or not, and when the event is witnessed. Possessing a recording creates a power imbalance not present when merely witnessing an event. This alone makes having a recording drastically different from merely being a live witness. (There are other differences in degree as well, such as that live witnesses can only collect information if they happen to attend to it, but recordings can be played back repetitively and scrutinized). 

...let's pause here. We feel as if these are our decisions; and as if we are in control. I think adding the word "consciousness" to this adds theoretical baggage... the theory that everything that is us is conscious. This is part of where you're going awry. For example, by the above model, if intentions are generated unconsciously, we could still become aware of those intentions. And if our sense of control is a perception of attaining intentions, we can consciously experience this as control without it being a superfluous sensation. In such a case, the intentions genuinely won't be "consciously made", but our conscious experience of it won't be illusory either; it would be a genuine percept of attaining a real intention. In other words, "something" does indeed have the intention, and the sense of control is indeed about "something" related to attaining the intention; it's just that this "something" isn't a conscious process, but rather is merely a thing that at some point is experienced consciously. 

This is a snippet from The Enchiridion, by Epictetus (translated by Elizabeth Carter). Epictetus's general attitude towards life is about accepting things beyond your control, even things which otherwise would cause pain and suffering. He believed that essentially when you build expectations of things beyond your control, including things having to do with your life and health and the life/health of your loved ones, you're only setting yourself up for disappointment. Instead, you should accept these things as what they are; temporary states. Epictetus's personal experiences were interesting as well; he was lame from childhood and born a slave. Epictetus was from the Stoic school of thought. 

To my knowledge, the correspondence theory of truth posits that a proposition is true iff there are states of affairs that reflect what the proposition indicates. E.g. "Snow is white" is true iff snow is actually white; truth becomes a property that arises from the mirroring of states of affairs in propositions. But how is this different from deflationism? Isn't "'Snow is white' is true iff snow is white" begging the question of what "iff snow is white" means? I'm confused on what the difference is between these accounts of truth as deflationism just seems like a shorthand for using correspondence as a central truth criterion. To say "'Snow is white' iff snow is white" means the same thing as its correspondence counterpart. 

It seems to me that the rejection of the validity of induction would cause a deep skepticism in pretty much everything but most prominently in perception. If we can never assume uniformity of nature, then every inference about the future and the future based on the past is invalid. Thus wouldn't the rejection of induction restrict us to only be able to talk validly about our present phenomenal experiences or whatever is directly present in the mind? What are the practical ramifications of rejecting induction? It seems that it would throw us all into intense skepticism. 

I'm currently writing a paper for a class that's supposed to "weave" together the philosophical system presented in Plato's Allegory and dialogues. When I spoke with my professor on the assignment, he said that Plato's own philosophical opinions were unwritten and cannot necessarily be gleaned from his own writings, and thus I ought not to refer to the system found in Plato's texts as "Plato's philosophy." Is this true? Are we wrong to attribute things like the Theory of Forms and the proto-social contract theory as described in Meno to Plato? 

I am aware that Kant addressed Hume's skepticism on causality, but I don't see anything in his CPR that solves the problems of induction and uniformity of nature in other contexts like everyday life, where Hume's question, "will the sun rise tomorrow?" seems to persist. Exactly how does/would Kant solve the problems of induction (particularly uniformity of nature) in non-causal contexts, if he did at all? I am aware that there has already been a question like this, but I thought the answer to it only addressed induction in the context of causal formulations about the world; in this respect, I think Kant only dodged the problem of induction in causal formulations by solidifying causality as an intuition. Rationalizing your belief that the sun will rise tomorrow and rationalizing your belief that C-fiber firing causes pain seem to be two different things. 

It seems intuitive to me to think that if there is a basic substance or building block of nature (e.g. fermions and leptons, etc.), then all facts regarding entities comprised of that substance are reducible into facts about instances of said substance. For example, the term "water" is reducible, on a chemical level, to "two hydrogen atoms combined with an oxygen atom via covalent bonds." In turn, this chemical equivalent of "water" is reducible to something like "two sets of identical combinations of subatomic particles combined with another unique combination of subatomic particles via [insert some atomic description of covalent bonds] (I'm no physicist)." I like to think that this process can proceed until we reach the most basic of substances, at which point we would arrive at the most primal description of a phenomena. I think topics of the social sciences are subject to this as well. For instance, "a language" can be reduced to "particular sets of certain reverberations used in certain groups of massive collections of subatomic particles (people) who engage in brain states that correlate both/either artifacts of physical substance and/or brain states with some of those particular reverberations of sound." Obviously, you could go "deeper" in the analysis, but for the sake of time and my sanity, I won't try to do any better; you probably get the idea. That was just my understanding of a typical reductionist project, but I have a feeling that I might have just conflated reductionism with physicalism. My question still stands, regardless: What are some of the problems with reducing natural and social phenomena into facts about the primary substance of which they are all ultimately made of?
