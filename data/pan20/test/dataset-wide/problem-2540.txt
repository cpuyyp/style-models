Yes, Consciousness is the same. Consciousness is not a thing, its a "knowing". One of the reasons this is not understandable intellectually, is because we use conventional language to talk about phenomena that cannot be reduced to conventional reality. The Buddha once said that it is okay to use conventional language but do not be fooled thereby. Consciousness is the basic awareness of an object and nothing more. It only exists as a taker of objects. One will understand this when practicing Vipassana meditation. One will clearly see how there cannot be conscious experience without consciousness is present. Let me give you can example from daily life, which you might have experienced. You are reading a good book or watching a movie and then someone calls your name. You are absorped in the book or movie and therefore do not hear the person trying to get in contact with you. How is that? The sound from the other person is still there, yes? That is because consciousness is not at the ear-sensebase at that moment. Consciousness is at the eye-sensebase. That is why you did not register the sound from the other person. The sound is still there but you are not aware of it, because consciousness did not take that object, at that particular time. One can only be aware of one object at a time. Mind can only arise to one object at a time. It might feel like one is aware of multiple objects at a time, but that is because Mind is shifting very rapidly and mindfulness is not strong enough to register that. 

Here are some quotes that i think fit to your question. They can be found in above mentioned book, from the chapter: "Can the First Cause be Known?", p. 166-168: 

Four great elements : what is the other 2 elements? In the Nikaya Texts, there is a term called 'Cattari Mahabhutani'(four Mahabhuta). These Mahabhutani consitute Rupa. (See Sammaditthi Sutta). A being (human being is an instance) is defined in terms of six Dhatus. It is Cattari Mahabhutani and Akasa and Vinnana Dhatus (Caddhaturo Ayam Puriso) (See for example Bhahudhatukasuttam.) However, there are no meaningful translations of these Suttas in any language. These Suttas could be understood only by Lord Buddha's direct disciples, who listened to Lord Buddha in person. This non-understanding is the reason for the existence numerous Buddhist traditions and sects. 

"Are there any body who achieved Nibbana currently (in the current world). If so give one or two names, please". The easiest answer to the above question is to say 'Not known'. However, please consider the following. The name Lord Buddha (Bhagava Buddho) gave to his teaching is Dhamma-Vinaya. Dhamma cannot be understood because it is based on: Dukkha Ariyasacca. Dukkha (dukkham) cannot be translated into English. See the following quote from the entry, Dukkha in the PED. B. (nt.; but pl. also dukkhā, e. g. S i.23; Sn 728; Dh 202, 203, 221. Spelling dukha (after sukha) at Dh 83, 203). There is no word in English covering the same ground as Dukkha does in Pali. Our modern words are too specialised, too limited, and usually too strong. Sukha & dukkha are ease and dis-ease (but we use disease in another sense); or wealth and ilth from well & ill (but we have now lost ilth); or wellbeing and ill-ness (but illness means something else in English). We are forced, therefore, in translation to use half synonyms, no one of which is exact. Dukkha is equally mental & physical. Pain is too predominantly physical, sorrow too exclusively mental, but in some connections they have to be used in default of any more exact rendering. Discomfort, suffering, ill, and trouble can occasionally be used in certain connections. Misery, distress, agony, affliction and woe are never right. They are all much too strong & are only mental (see Mrs. Rh. D. Bud. Psy. 83 -- 86, quoting Ledi Sadaw). Ariyasacca is usually given the English Equivalent 'Noble Truth'. The term 'noble truth' is not in Oxford Dictionaries. That means it is not an English word. No one understands the Dukkha Ariyasacca, therefore they cannot understand Nibbana. Therefore the question is meaningless. 

I noticed some buddhist monks spend a lot of their time teaching and giving dhamma talks, while other monks spend minimal time on these things. I was wondering if there are any rules in the monastic code for monks regarding how much time a monk should spent on teaching? 

It is not a sin. Lust is born out of desire. Desire is one of the root defilements (kilesas). It can manifest itself in different ways, e.g. sexual preference, body type preferences etc. Lust is still lust, no matter what object its involved with. 

To sum up: The child is the cause for its own suffering. The father can only impinge on the child's senses. Its the identifying, taking ownership of and having aversion to the objects that creates the suffering. 

24 hours a day. Ideally. Until that becomes possible, practice as frequent as possible, while working on balancing the five spiritual faculties. Reminding is not enough - it should be insight meditation (vipassana) which is practiced. Intellectually reminding oneself, will lead not to insights. 

Ven. Bhikkhu Bodhi treats these poisons/kilesas on a deeper level in his book The Noble Eightfold Path, p. 8, 80-81: 

When Wisdom is gained through the practice of insight meditation one learns to navigate more skillfully in Samsara, i.e. to reduce the amount of suffering for oneself and others, through wholesome/skillful deeds, motivated by wholesome intentions. Skillful action would not be to purposely inflict suffering onto oneself. 

I think there are different reasons why it can be difficult to practice Metta meditation. What could those reasons be? First of all there is the 5 hindrances. I am sure you already know them so i will not go further into them here. The second hindrance which is ill-will (hatred, anger, resentment towards oneself/others, hostility towards one self/others/the meditation object etc.) can be a hindrance for metta meditation. As with most of the spiritual work we do one has to begin with oneself. One has to develop oneself, care about oneself, forgive oneself for the things one has done to others and what others have done to oneself. If one cannot be there for oneself then how can one expect one to be there for other people? Yet alone send metta towards other beings. Im not saying you are not there for yourself because i do not know anything about that. I am here coming with suggestions for you to further falsify/validate by yourself. It could be that you have some unfinished business with yourself or that you have some hostility towards yourself. In metta meditation one begins with wishing metta for oneself. Oneself is first base, the foundation. So if one finds it difficult to sent metta to other people it can be helpful to take a look at the sender, the giver - oneself. How can you do that then? There are different methods. The purpose is to wish for example; "may i be happy, peaceful and free from mental and physical suffering". Thats one way to wish metta for oneself. Another way is to try to look at the deeds you have done in your life and see if any of them is worth respecting. You can look at it as if the deeds where done by another person and then ask yourself; is that deed worth respecting? Is that deed helpful to other beings? If you can answer yes to any of these questions then you can use the metta from that deed to sent to yourself. Next step in the metta meditation is to sent metta to loved ones for example parents or family in general. Then comes friends, then neutral persons, then persons who are your enemies/people who consider you their enemy/people who just dont like you etc., then comes all beings in this world. You dont even have to follow that order i just wrote. You can sent metta to the aforementioned people in any order you want. Although most people find it the easiest to begin with sending metta to family or loved ones and then use that generated metta to sent to other people. So when you reach hostile persons and find it difficult to generate any metta for them then you can go back to sending metta to your family or loved ones and when metta is generated then go back to the hostile persons and sent it to them. Its important that the metta is there or else it will be like you said; just empty words one is sending forth. An important note: a) dont be too hard on yourself. It serves no purpose. If there arises emotions or other of the 5 aggregates, use your vipassana to observe them, note them and let them go. b) in my message when i use terms like "oneself, you, people etc." im only speaking on a conventional level. Im not dealing with ultimate reality here. Lanka 

"What are the “Qualities of the Buddha”?" Qualities of 'Bhagava Araham Sammasambuddho' is infinite and cannot be known by any human being. Please see Sampasadaniya Sutta of Digha Nikaya. The expression "qualities of the Buddha" belong to English Buddhism. Oxford Dictionaries define the 'the Buddha' as a historical figure that lived about 25 centuries ago-his birth date or the date of death is unknown. However, the Tipitaka published by the Pali Text Society refer to a Bhagava Araham Sammasambuddho, in the Sutta and Vinaya Pitakas. Most of the words in the two Pitakas are utterences of Bhagava; the word means a spiritual teacher. Human beings who have no clue to even the physical form of Bhagava, what would they know about his mind? 

Isnt the desire for giving up the desires, a desire? Yes, certainly. That desire is what causes one to give up. If I use the term Tanha for desire, then Tanha is the cause of existence. Tanha is eradicated only reaching the statuse of Arahant. 

Buddhism is neither a religion nor a philosophy. Buddhism can refer to the Truths (Ariyasaccani) (Dhamma) pointed out by Lord Buddha (Buddho Bhagava) to the world and His explanations thereof as given in the Nikaya texts published by the Pali Text Society; or To the numerous Buddhist traditions, both living and dead. All these traditions arose after the First Council and the before the Second Council (See 2500 Years of Buddhism, Government of India, 1956). Almost all these traditions do not acknowledge a 'creator god'nor they worship one.None of them are religions. It is needless to say that Dhamma is not a philosophy. It is called a philosophy by people who do not and cannot ever understand Dhamma. This is the reason for numerous 'interpretations' of Dhamma. 

What a great question and a tough one. I do not have a final answer to this but i will try to give my input from a point of view of Theravada buddhism. If i were to answer your question "hardcore" i would say that a Livelihood where one kills other living beings cannot be considered Right Livelihood. Why is that? Let's take a look at the 1st precept and which factors one must fulfill in order to break the precept. 

What are the 3 recollection (protection) chants of the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha? It's told that they can be used to dispel fear. Thank you for your time. 

There are the 5 five hindrances that stand in the way as obstacles for developing in ones practice and for reaching Nibbana. In brief the five hindrances are: 

Kamma is a peculiar thing. Only a fully enlightened Buddha can understand the workings of Kamma. Also the workings of Kamma is one of the Four Imponderables (acinteyyas). We have lived countless of lives and all beings therefore have different kamma. Two beings can perform the same act, motivated by the same root, e.g. Greed or Anger, but recieve a very different result. That is based on past kamma. Some beings might have practiced a lot of meditation and done a lot of wholesome deeds in the past, while others may not have done that. That will issue different kammic results to the same volitional action. Throughout the Sutta Pitaka, there are many examples of the Buddha giving a special meditation course or technique to a being, while another being gets a totally different course or technique. That is because the Buddha knew the past kamma of a being and thereby which technique would be suitable for exactly that being. There is an example from the Dhammapada verse 25; The Story of Cūlapanthaka. Cūlapanthaka was not able to progress in meditation and was very sad about this. He was about to give up his life as a monk and become a lay person again. Then he met the Buddha who comforted him and gave him a piece of white cloth. The Buddha explained to him, that he had to sit in the sun and rub the cloth with his hands, while saying "taking off impurity". He rubbed the cloth which became dirty and Cūlapanthaka realized the impermanence of conditioned phenomena and attained arahantship. The Buddha gave him this technique because he knew that in the past Cūlapanthaka was a king moving around in the sun and often wiped his head with a piece of cloth and in this former existence of his, he also thought about the impermanence of conditioned phenomena, while seeing the cloth getting dirty. This time it lead to him becomming and arahant, gaining mastery of analytical knowledge and gaining knowledge of all three Pitakas. 

What, precisely, is kamma/karma? There is no answer to the above question: Kamma is not in the Oxford Dictionaries. Thus its meaning is dependent on the user. Karma is defined in the Oxford Dictionary, thus: Definition of karma in English: karma 1[mass noun] (in Hinduism and Buddhism) the sum of a person's actions in this and previous states of existence, viewed as deciding their fate in future existences. Wikipedia defines it as follows: Karma (Sanskrit: कर्म; IPA: [ˈkərmə] ( listen); Pali: kamma) means action, work or deed;[1] it also refers to the spiritual principle of cause and effect where intent and actions of an individual (cause) influence the future of that individual (effect).[2] Good intent and good deed contribute to good karma and future happiness, while bad intent and bad deed contribute to bad karma and future suffering.[3][4] Karma is closely associated with the idea of rebirth in many schools of Asian religions.[5] In these schools, karma in the present affects one's future in the current life, as well as the nature and quality of future lives - one's saṃsāra.[6] With origins in ancient India, karma is a key concept in Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, Sikhism,[7] and Taoism.[8]. There is no precise definition for Karma. The word Kamma is not found in the Nikaya Texts of Theravada; however, it is found in compounds. A word kammaṃ is found in the Nikaya texts. The words cetanāhaṃ bhikkave kammaṃ vadāmi is an example of usage. The meaning of the word is not understood is clear from the discussion. 

"Was Buddhism a rebellion against the Aryans?" It is difficult for me to understand this question. Oxford Dictionary defines Buddhism thus: A widespread Asian religion or philosophy, founded by Siddartha Gautama in NE India in the 5th century bc. Aryan is defined as: Relating to or denoting a people speaking an Indo-European language who invaded northern India in the 2nd millennium bc, displacing the Dravidian and other aboriginal peoples. I am unable to see the connection between Buddhism and Aryans. However, it is a fact that Pali Text Society, London, publishes a set of books it calls Tripitaka. In this set there are two Pitakas called Sutta and Vinaya Pitakas. These Pitakas attribute virtually all the saying in them to a person named Bhagava, meaning Lord. There are many other epithets by which he was known. The Sutta Pitaka essentially contains the truths about all beings--humans, gods, animals and so on. This is the Dhamma pointed out by the Lord (Bhagavata Dhammo). The Lord was the Leader of gods and men (Sattha Devamanussanam) and the Dhamma was for the welfare and happiness of all beings. The word Ariya is found in the Dhamma. It has no racial connotations whatsoever in the Dhamma. There is no English equivalent for the word. One of the guiding prinicples of the Dhamma, called Avihinsa is never to kill or hurt any living being under any circumstances. Why talk about rebellion? The Dhamma of the Lord, was verified by the Lord by seeing with his own eyes (Sacchikatva) before proclaiming to the world. They are absolute truths. 

If you are asking about whether Samatha meditation alone can lead to enlightenment the answer is no. Why is that? In Vipassana meditation you have ultimate reality as your object of meditation. By having reality as your object you achieve insight into how reality functions i.e. the 3 signs of existence; anicca, dukkha, anatta. When penetrating into reality one can attain enlightenment through realizising one of these signs. When one is doing Samatha meditation alone one can only gain tranquility i.e. a strong concentration and the jhanas. One cannot any achieve insights into reality and therefore not become enlightened. That is because in samatha meditation one does not have ultimate reality as an object. Instead one has a concept as an object e.g. one of the 10 kasinas. One is trying to keep that object static by keeping attention on the object through the means of applied and sustained thought. You can think about it in another way. Lets say you had a big stone in front you and you want to carve out a figure from that stone. To do that you need an instrument, a tool. Concentration is your tool and the stone is reality. In order for you to be able to carve into the stone you need the tool to be sharp. In other words you need to sharpen your tool. That is where samatha meditation is used. You use samatha meditation to train and sharpen your concentration so that you can use concentration as a tool to carve/penetrate into reality and then gain insights into how reality functions. So back to the stone. If you only sharpen your tool will that ever lead you to enlightenment? No its not possible. Samatha meditation is like that sharpening. By doing samatha meditation you are only making your tool sharper, better and more precise but you are never actually applying that tool to the stone. You are never actually carving the stone. That is why samatha meditation alone cannot lead you to enlightenment. Lanka
