When putting a new tire on a bicycle, there is usually a note somewhere on the sidewall showing the direction the tire is supposed to rotate when you are on the bicycle. However, the last time I changed my tire I already had the tire mounted on the rim and inflated before I remembered to check for this marking, and it turned out I had it backwards. Rather than take the tire off and do the whole thing over again - or leave the tire to rotate "backwards", I opted simply to put the wheel on backwards, as it was the front tire and there did not seem to be anything dictating which side of the bike the quick release had to be on. I have ridden about 20 miles so far without any issues, but I am wondering, what, if any, are the long term consequences of either this approach (riding with the tire backwards from the standpoint of the rim being backwards with respect to the quick release being on the opposite side from the back tire), or simply riding the tire in the opposite direction as labelled on the tire. For the latter, I am wondering if it really makes any difference, because in my case I had to really search for the direction indicator as it was barely discernable. I'm riding a road bike (touring geometry) and the tire itself is a long-life, hard casing type, as opposed to soft "performance tire" types which get flats more easily but are supposed to handle better. 

For instance, in some cases I will see a particular bike tire listed as available in 700x25, 700x25c, 700c x 25, and 700 x 25mm. (Just picking out a number here, it could be 23, 25, 27, etc.) What, if any, is the difference between these? I would think that 700x25 is the same as 700 x 25mm, but I'm not so sure about the "c" when it lists both "700x25" and "700x25c" as sizes for the same tire on the same site, and lists different prices for each! 

I never carry anything special on Centuries. I carry water and Clif bars but I carry that stuff anyway. The one thing I do differently is eat and drink more. It sounds like you have plenty of stops at good intervals. Make sure to eat a lot at each one of those whether you're hungry or not. I wouldn't take any clothes. You'll be fine. We wear clothes all day and we're fine. I certainly wouldn't take anything that I haven't been training with previously. Don't run a race with new shoes. Or whatever the bike equivalent is. This is me. If I were in this ride and there was help and food stations set up, I wouldn't take any of my own. I wouldn't want the encumbermant of self-help products. Plus, it would be pretty cool to go on a long ride without that stuff. Let the volunteers do what they do. Let them feed you, let them fix your tires, let them carry out the trash. They want to do it. You hardly never get help on the road so take advantage of it. 

Sometimes when I set out on a ride I will get the absolute worst foot pain. It is like a cramp in my arches on both feet. I am wondering where exactly the center of the pedal should fall in relation to my foot. 

A lot of bike shops will give you a few if you ask and buy something else on your way out. You They are soft aluminum and are a dime a dozen. You could bite them on or you can use pliers. Just twist your cable strands back in place and then crimp away. 

A regular bicycle tire can be just as sturdy and last just as long under more stress by a regular rider. The joke I have heard among cyclists involve a newcomer to a bike race such as RAGBRAI with an electric bike who inevitably falls behind (and is surprised by this) because regular cyclists (not even pros, just people who ride daily and are serious about cycling) can frequently output more watts on a consistent bike than the legal limits of an electric bike, or at least outperform on stretches where the electric has trouble and falls behind. So, an e-bike may or may not need "dedicated" tires. But... eBikes are not marketed towards people who are interested in putting in a lot of exertion in their ride. Those people don't need electric assist. While the question does not say what "dedicated" means, there are a couple of possibilities. One is that, being marketed towards people who are more interested in getting from point A to point B economically which a bit of fitness thrown in on the side, it can make sense to sell "niche" or "proprietary" tires which are optimized towards that goal. These tires can be cheaper to make, at the expense of the second point, weight. But the rider can easily tolerate this since the bicycle is motor assisted. Because of this trade-off a heavier tire can also be made tougher to last longer to match the target market of people who don't want to be on the side of the road changing a tire. 

I recently had an inner tube on my mountain bike changed, but it was my wife that actually took the bike in to the shop for service. When it came back I noticed the stem has a blue cap rather than the typical black cap. I have seen slime inner tubes that have a green cap, so it got me to wondering if there was something different about the tire. Although I hadn't asked for slime and she didn't remember anything being said about it, it's possible they could have just thrown it in as a freebie. (This sort of thing has happened before where they quote one price over the phone and then the actual price winds up being less than what they quoted.) I have also noticed that at one point the tire went flat uncharacteristically fast (within a couple days of non-use compared to normal losses of a maximum of 1/3 pressure over a week), but after I pumped it back up it seemed to hold its pressure fairly well over a longer time period, which suggests to me that either there was a tiny leak which somehow sealed itself when the tube was re-pressurized, or slime was involved. Aside from actually taking off the tire and taking out the tube and shaking it, how can I tell if a given tire has slime in it? 

I had a similar long-range trip. I was a member of a local bike group and asked them if they, as a part of our membership, owned and lent bike luggage to members. They said they didn't have any but that it was a good idea. Maybe other bike clubs around your town might have luggage that you could rent. You might want to try bike shops and see if they have any shipping boxes. I get boxes from my LBS to ship eBay parts. Have you explored shipping it to yourself or to your hotel or a friend? There is something scary about shipping a super expensive bike in a soft bag. My advice would be not to do it. I don't think bubble wrap would help. I imagine a suit case sitting on spokes and it makes me cringe. 

I have left all of my navigation needs to my iPhone5. I like the 'one-device' scenario. For my longer distance stuff I am starting to get into cue sheets. I think mapmyride.com has them available when you make a map. Cue sheets have distance and name of next turn but also how long until the turn. My iPhone does all of that so I don't know how much you want to fiddle with on the bike ride. A mounted smart phone with scrolling cue sheets is easier to read than a map. 

I clean my stuff with Simple Green. Rinse. Simple Green. Rinse until clean. I wouldn't use WD-40 if I were you though. I am not sure about the chemistry behind it but it is not a degreaser and there are plenty of other better options out there. Don't use grease either. Use a light oil. And remove the excess. I keep an old toothbrush around to brush in all of the oil to make sure I have all the little pieces coated then wipe off any excess. Anything dripping or about to form drips is excess. With grease and excess oil comes accumulation of dirt which is abrasive. By not using grease with is sticky and wiping excess oil you are effectively limiting the abrasives that stick to your chain. I am not super sure of what you mean by 'Dry Lube' I think you mean either a Teflon based lube or lube that is meant for dry conditions. I have used Teflon-based stuff before and it was a pink, waxy mess. That could just be the brand though. All the bike shops around me use Tri-Flo. Thats what I use. I have a small bottle that has lasted for years. 

I tend to spin rather slow when I am riding. 50rpm is a comfortable rate for me to spin for as long as I want to ride. 90rpm seems to be the rate at which I expend maximum power... I can't spin this longer than about 2 1/2 minutes on a -2% (downhill) grade, but going uphill I can sprint at least 15 seconds on a +12% grade starting at 90rpm (corresponding to close to 30mph), before I start to slow down appreciably, and correspondingly I have found that I perform much better on hills due to the lower cadences required. Now my concern is higher cadences are generally recommended (I especially see this when people are asking about higher gear ratios to go faster), and I have been told that 50rpm is way too low for a cruising cadence. But if I do something like interval training to increase my cadence I am concerned that this will affect my climbing strength. Is this something I should worry about, or is there a specific approach that can result in me being able to tolerate higher cadences, without losing power at the low end? 

I currently have a 12-30t rear cassette which needs replacing. While I'm at it, I really want to switch to an 11 tooth to get the extra 9% in top speed. But the problem is, even the most expensive (e.g. Ultegra) component that will work with my bike only goes up to 11-28, and if I stick to Tiagra I'm stuck with 11-25. For long steep hills on an off day, it's really nice to have the 30 tooth. So my second thought was, the bottom 2 or 3 cogs usually aren't fixed to the cassette, they are individual cogs that can come off. So maybe I could get a 12-30 replacement, and then a single 11t cog to replace the 12t or maybe I could even drop the 13t so the stepping goes 11-12-14. This would be ideal as I use the 12t and 14t heavily but I virtually never use the 13t. Would this work? From what I can see, I would also need an 11t lock ring. I'm having a difficult time finding both a lock ring and an 11t cog which claims to be compatible. For instance, I found one cog which claimed to only work various cassettes which were already 11-xx and which were 2-3 grades above my Tiagra components. Update: I found this PDF file on the Tiagra CS-4600 which suggests I need part Y1YF01000 ("Lock Ring for 11T Top Gear"), and Y1Z81100N ("Sprocket Wheel 11T (Built in spacer type)"). But I can't find anywhere (for instance Amazon or Google Shopping) to buy these part numbers or the corresponding parts. 

More likely you punctured the tube while installing it. You have to be careful to not pinch the new tube between the rim and the tire. Also take care not to puncture the new tube with your tire levers. When changing a tire I'll inflate it the tube about 50% and then peel the tire around to make sure the tube is not pinched. Then I deflate and the reinflate to recommended pressure. I use plenty of lube on the bead too. That can be water or better but grosser, spit. 

You could probably rent a Wacker ( yes, that is the real name ) at a local construction equipment rental store. It is a tool that ground construction workers use. It is basically a really heavy steel plate that an engine sits on. The engine vibrates the whole machine and the weight and the vibration compact the ground very tightly. You'd have to work in layers. Don't expect to compact the whole mound all at once. That is not the way it works. The giant rollers on freeway construction sites do the same thing. 

I like the find-a-brand-you-like-and-stick-with-that idea. If the store let you try them on then they let someone else try them on, too. Remember, chamois' are not padding. They are for moisture management. A proper saddle and fit is for comfort. I have several brands of bibs and I only use one. My riding buddies are the same way but with their own brand. Hopefully, you won't find that your brand is the expensive one. I like Castelli. I am also moving towards a thinner chamois. I have had issues with all the added bulk in my crotch and a thinner chamois fits better. I have heard others say the same thing. 

Depending on where you live, wind can be highly unpredictable and fickle. I use Google weather (google for "wind speed" and then click on "wind"; n.b. this apparently won't work in some mobile browsers) to get a rough idea of what the winds are going to be like for the day. However, I have found that even this can be horribly inaccurate if you ride any place hilly. In my experience the wind direction can shift 90 degrees between valleys and the ridges, and can even turn 180 degrees along the course of the ride, meaning I start with a nice tail wind, and then half way through the ride I run into a head wind. Since you are commuting, I wouldn't count on a head wind in one direction to imply a tail wind in the other. This will depend a lot on where you are, but in my experience it is often not true. When I ride I tend to look for flags along the way to determine the direction and rough speed of the wind. This allows me to gauge roughly what the wind is like, and if you want to you can make a note of these along the way and write them down in a log when you get a chance. The downside I have found with this is that often I will start depending on a flag in a particular place and then suddenly it will get taken down. An anemometer mounted on the bike has been mentioned, but one issue with this is that it doesn't consider your riding profile. If you are riding in an aero position and then switch to standing to climb a hill, even with the same wind speed and direction you will encounter different wind forces. I don't think subtracting off your speed would be a big deal, but you would need some kind of sensor to try to determine where you were sitting, standing, hunched over, etc. and this could be tricky and error prone or at the least tedious. Since you are using Strava, one thing you can do to try to factor out the wind in determining your fitness and performance level is to take advantage of Strava segments. Break your ride down into smaller pieces, using your knowledge of having ridden the route before to decide what the optimal segments are. This may already be done for you in places. If you are concerned about having lots of segments you can make them private so it only compares your performance to yourself. Then, the idea is to concentrate your efforts on the segment(s) that have the most favorable wind for the day. You won't be able to compare your entire route every day, but depending on conditions you might not want to push yourself hard every single day anyway.
