Reliability, and to a certain extent, culture. The americans, and british for example do not like autoloaders, with a human loader and an isolated compartment for shells being less likely to cook off and kill the crew. In addition, at the end of the day its a human who makes the decision to pull that trigger, and kill someone, not a machine, least in this day and age. You still have to decide if you want to fire, or get the enemy to surrender, and occationally act on gut instinct. 

Something similar to a Strangler fig, though rather than a single plant it might be many would work. Rather than a single large tree, it would be a fast growing population of trees, possibly aminable to coppicing, possibly this could be a combination of a primary 'structural' plant, with a vine like plant that grows fast and thickens to a woody, strong structure. While nothing like this exists in nature, over time you have a central tree that dies and spreads, and strangler vines acting much like a natural lumberjack, and then dying as nutrients run out near the centre. Due to this you wouldn't have a nice round circular trunk, but rather a interconnected series of naturally tangled living and dead wood. 

Cities don't necessarily need to be tall. They can be wide. While concrete reinforced steel is commonly used in skyscrapers, its worth remembering that there's other materials strong in compression Assuming its a lifeless rock, you have lots of space to build. Quarry whatever ignesious rocks you have and build out rather than build up.. The incans had a city that was built entirely out of precision cut, interlocking stones. With reasonably high tech cutting tools you could do similar work on harder materials. While I'm not a civil engineer, I do also wonder if you could get a similar effect to rebar (the tensile strength of steel adding compressive force to the stone here) by drilling through and threading/clamping steel rods or wire . 

In more northern climes, domestic sheep will be as common (or more common) than goats, especially for their wool production. Expect to eat a lot of feta cheese. Depending on how "Mad Max" we're getting, bullets will retain their value if hunting or defense becomes necessary. Glass tends to be too fragile to depend on when there's no police force keeping vandals and burglars from breaking windows. Plexiglass and other clear plastics become very attractive options for windows. Honey is a good alternative for sugar that's not very "work intensive" but fulfills the public sweet tooth. Expect dried/baked honey as treats in the long term, with an established beehive being a MAJOR money maker both as a producer and a pollinator. Salted, brined, and dried Goods like fish, meat, and certain vegetables would replace our canned goods when we run out - they last a good while and can be produced in your home with little special equipment. That being said: Salt would become incredibly economically important again for these purposes. We currently extract salt in large factories and mines (yes, even your hoity-toity Pink Himalayan salt and Black Hawaiian salts.) When those shut down, you'd be digging by hand (unlikely) or using the age-old method of evaporating it out of the sea water. Setting up large plexiglass evaporators will help distill both salt and water - a double win. This will require a decent bit of land to accomplish at a worthwhile scale, though. In terms of the economics, we would see broad hoarding at the start with overinflated prices vis a vis supply with large fluctuations. When the market calms down (and populations stabilize,) we'd see a return to rationality with relatively stable rates depending on production - lower for grains and farmed goods, higher for complicated, hard to replace goods like durable metal objects, quality clothes, and refined foods like candy (twinkies?). Within about a week, most produce will have gone bad. Without the shipping infrastructure, getting fresh fruits out of season will be nearly impossible. In old still life paintings, the presence of fresh fruit, and especially oranges, was a distinct sign of wealth. There is ancient literature that describes people's wealth by stating that they had winter fruits in the summer and summer fruits in the winter. Locally produced fruits will be cheap at the point of production but very valuable as trade goods in a caravan outside of normal growing ranges and seasons. Expect more dried fruits for preservation, especially for berries, cherries, and the like. Melons don't really preserve though (and require lots of water), so serving watermelon, canteloupe, honeydew, etc. will be a strong display of wealth. Things like peanuts will be valued for their high nutrient content and long storage life (as will all legumes in general), so they will be valuable, but probably reserved for special or extreme occasions (either a celebration or a food shortage) which will keep their price in check - people won't consume them as quickly as other, more perishable produce. In the long run, we'd probably start substituting a more readily available good for the latter category - like the aforementioned honey for candy, wooden items for metal, rough woven cloth for manufactured cotton, etc. Eventually, it will be so commonplace that using a metal spoon will seem strange to the average individual. Only "collectors" will be interested in these special items, and will probably be willing to pay a premium for people able to find "vintage" relics of the "earth that was." PS: dried grains wouldn't get "used up" - you always preserve enough of your harvest for AT LEAST one year of sowing, preferably two (in case one crop fails.) Economic Timeline: Week 1: panic. massive looting, little real economic activity. Formation of raiding/looting groups. Week 2: most unprocessed food starts to spoil. Panic driven trading and inflation. Groups will start to merge/compete/disband/fight. Some will probably start to engage in long term planning, such as creating mutual defense pacts and farming/trading collectives. Month 2: people start to settle down from panic and focus on short term survival. Durable goods, seeds dominate trading. Months 3-6: depending on the season, people focus on purchasing livestock for animal labor and interim food supplies while crops grow. Travelling labor collectives and small towns form. Month 12: People coming to grips with a year of post apocalyptic living. Longer term planning starts to come into effect. People focus on making tools. Metalworking repair skills will become very valuable to keep equiment functioning. New metal will be harder to come by. People began to craft rough metal and wooden tools as replacements. Medical supplies become scarce, people start dying from basic bacterial infections. People start substituting beer for suspect water. Evaporators set up to provide for fresh water and tradeable salt. Years 2-3: Expect to see the first batches of distilled alcohol, low percentages, not well aged. Also expect to see methanol poisoning. Possible establishment of some sort of currency - either grain, peanuts, or workable metals. Years 4-10: Food prices stabilize locally based upon available producers and inter-regional trade. Non-seasonal fruit recognized as a status symbol. Very few pre-apocalyptic durable consumables remain. People shift consumption to renewable goods. Assuming that they aren't burnt for warmth, books are valuable sources of knowledge and entertainment. Many modern books will decay due to exposure (your paperback is made of VERY cheap paper). Second decade: Children of the apocalypse come of age. Raised without cultural trappings, they will find plasticware and metal utensils strange. Wealthy older people become collectors willing to pay money for rare items. Third decade: The start of larger governments, either warlords or something resembling the Senate of old. Stability means people start to recreate old knowledge of medicine, science, and technology, trying to preserve what they remember before it becomes irretrievably lost once the next generation takes over. 

Ramming is roughly the worst primary form of attack possible. You risk your hull breaching and you'd need to maneuver a largeish mass precisely enough to hit another largish mass. I could think of a few things that would make it necessary though. You want to hurt the other guy as badly as possible without getting hurt yourself 

pushes a piston that launches the missile fires a counterweight that's shredded, and dispersed safely, or somehow trapped over a longer period of time. keeping the need to adjust the ship's thrust to compensate minimal, greatly simplifying the process. 

Or some other form of penance in their spare time. At some point though, there's some crimes that need more serious punishment. Murder for example. 

To some extent, cephelapods communicate by colour. In theory, deaf people communicate through the manipulation of EM waves - aka sign language. While Probably completely alien to us these are the 'simplest' modes of communication and pretty much have reasonable 'bandwidth', specially with more adapted limbs or other body parts. For example you could get far more combinations of 'words' or 'letters' from a limb with a reasonable amount of prehensile sub-components, colour and even texture than from a human hand. While communication by pheromones, or smell is another possibility, the need to wait for the chemicals to dissipate makes complex communication hard. 

One proposal I haven't seen for dealing with your "boil the brain" idea (I calculated an answer to the energy requirements for that spell in a different question) is that magic is based predominantly on will and animus. Thus, it is far harder to effect an already living entity (which has its own magic like life force) than it is to create a magical effect upon an inanimate object. To extend this point, your will to burn me is directly countered by my will to NOT explode in a fireball. That contest of wills, like locked lightsabers, is usually not resolved by "pushing through" but by disengaging and looking for a new opening. Thus, a magical sneak attack from an unexpected angle (dropping a boulder) is more likely to be effective than a direct attack. Similarly, the mere existence of an army defending a castle from intruders crafts a blockade against teleporting into that fortress. Another issue to solve teleportation is to make it intrinsically risky and "wibbly-wobbly." Sure you could march an army through a portal, but without a friendly mage with a corresponding portal and beacon on the other side it would be VERY risky and you might get trapped inside the pocket dimension. And who says teleportation is instantaneous? Maybe it's just the equivalent of "flattening out" the mountains and valleys. You'd be marching the same functional distance but on flat land, making transport of goods easier but not necessarily faster. Regarding the issue of WILLFUL teleportation trade, then you've basically created a society with a large economic surplus due to safer trade and faster communication. So? We've got courier services now and the internet. It will make diplomacy interesting, since you might "fake" an alliance to gain access to their network of portals... or turn on your allies in the middle of the night with said portals... 

Wall-e. Adorable little cannibal trash compactor. Designed for his environment, though those arms... are a little odd. He is though a good basic design for a mobile, sentient trash compactor. Practical threads. simple box design In a sense though form follows function On the other hand, I like my industrial robots like I like my prison furniture. Firmly bolted to the ground. I suppose you could put them on rails, or maybe wheels, but why does my industrial equipment need to walk off and bother the local wildlife? There's a good reason modern robots are just arms 

I'd note the lack of usable fingers (How do they even pick up tools) and roughly the same range of motion as lego people. Non functional hips. No knees of elbows. No feet (how are they even standing????) Essentially this bodyplan makes tool use difficult, these folks would find it impossible to get up if they ever fell over and there's no plausible way it would work. 

Or rather that the races have been fighting so long that trust is hard. Orcs are tired of being nomadic since humans fear them so much any permanent settlement gets attacked. The nomadic orcs attack human settlements since they rely on raiding to survive. 

It would be low tech, allow for a variety of rounds to be used and simple for a oldschool navy to adapt to. Considering the missiles coast most of they way, they'd also possibly be harder to spot thermally, which might be handy. 

Since you're looking for "clean breaks," you'd have to get "creative" with your application of genetics... As I commented, doing 4 magics and a single mundane is fairly easy, since we have 4 bases. Assuming a single base in the magic gene is the determinant for affinity, this would make your phenotypes AA, CC, TT, GG, plus the six mixed bases (AC, AT, AG, CT, CG, TG). The "pure" phenotypes would be magical, and the mixed pairs would be mundane. This implies that half the population has no magical ability, and the remaining half is evenly divided among the four types. If two people share the exact magic affinity, then they will have a child with that exact magic affinity. If they have differing magic affinities, then their child will ABSOLUTELY be mundane. BUT, if there is a magic and non-magic pair, the chance still exists for the child to share the affinity of the magic parent. Assuming you don't know the genetic makeup of the mundane parent, then the chance of them having no matching bases (and therefore will always have a mixed base child) is (3/4*2/4)=3/8ths, meaning there is a 5/8ths chance of sharing a base and a resulting 5/16th's chance of the child being magical. For a mundane/mundane couple, each has 6 possible phenotypes, making 36 possibilities. Each has a single "opposite" phenotype with no chance of magical offspring (1/6 of magic not being possible). Matching mundane phenotypes (1/6 chance) would give a 1/2 chance of magical offspring of either of the base genotypes. The remaining 24 matches have single matches, which lead to a 1/4 chance of magical offspring. Once you've got genetic sequencing, you can ensure that "matching bases" always exist among couples which raises your chance of a magical child to 1/2 for a magic/mundane couple, 1/2 for a mundane/mundane couple where both bases match, and 1/4 for a couple with only 1 matching base. Hypothetically, you could do this without sequencing if you prevented mundanes from marrying one another - that means a mundane from a given union will always have at least the base of the magical parent, and mixed magic union will have a mundane human with a known pair of phenotypes. This gets us to 5 traits, though, not 6. To quote Wikipedia: 

Its all about material science, observation and weather. You'd need tightly woven, light material - early parachutes were made of silk, and that's a low tech material. You don't actually need to take off - you're already above the ground. You need lightweight, strong frameworks - aircraft have been made of wood, but bamboo-like material would work. Now the hard part is design. Someone would have to have observed that birds soared in thermals (rather than looking at flapping), someone needs to have designed aerofoils. Now here's the hard part - navigation You need to navigate, in 3d, taking into account wind currents, thermals and the like. You drop, grab a thermal, soar, and move towards the destination. Without modern technology, its tricky. Its not like finding an airfield in a fixed place at fixed altitude. 

Depends on the role/profession. In a sense, Londo's pretty much always dressed 'formally' and the majority of centauri you see are nobles and other folk who think rather highly of themselves. Considering many modern military ceremonial uniforms are based off or evolved from traditional outfits, its entirely plausible. Outside of that, its also trying to set a very important cultural example - that I am dressed in the manner of my people. Londo's the centauri republic. Its no different from when a female Indian dignitary wears a saree, or an Indonesian ambassador wears a batik shirt. Londo is not just Londo Molari. He represents the might and glory of the centauri republic (not to mention, nearly ever Centuri you see is a noble or at least wealthy).
