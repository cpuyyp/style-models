Understanding the best way to burn fat starts with some basic facts about how your body gets its energy: 

Because there are a lot of goals here it's definitely worth your training being very targeted in achieving these points. Running: In terms of running, your 3:2:1 program will be just fine, here is a nice article I spotted about achieving military standards of running through various training methods. Lower weight: This is going to be very difficult, you should look to weight all your food and be extremely strict in your dieting if you want to continue to lose weight. Your macro-nutritional profile should be tight as well. Neglecting either of these will lead to you becoming very tired, very quickly. Personally, I would reduce that 20% junk to 10%, or move to better junk options: Peanut butter, Nuts, high fat & salt snacks, anything that is low calorie and provides a good amount of protein. Increase Strength: Speaking of protein, you are going to need a good source to increase your overall strength by 15% as you don't sound like you are coming at this untrained. A untrained individual can increase their max linearly and 15% isn't a impossible target for a novice. Someone at a intermediate level will struggle though and should look to 3-6 days a week strength training. Explosive movement: Your amount of calisthenics is good to support an increase in jump height, definitely include box jumps in there. In term of other exercises to increase jump height, consider looking at Olympic weightlifting movements: clean and jerk require a lot of explosive, fast movement. However, consider getting a coach to teach you the basics. Stretching: Every time you are doing a cool-down, do the split stretch and variants therein. With the amount of exercise you are planning to do I believe your flexibility goal is easily achievable. Criticisms: 

"Definition" of a muscle is 100% determined by the amount of bodyfat that covers it. A lot of young guys look very defined when they are 16-19 because they have a very low bodyfat percentage and as a result you can see their muscles. Bodybuilders use fasting and dehydration to achieve the same look when working up to a competition. To get "definition" you need to diet to reduce body fat. On the subject of high reps to build muscle size. There is a lot of theories and science behind why bodybuilders find higher reps at their 60-80% 1RM to be better for building muscle than low reps at 85-95% that powerlifters use. Currently, it is believed that lower reps at higher weight builds strength more optimally than higher reps at lower weight which builds muscle size more optimally. This chart may help: 

The one-arm-dumbbell-row is a compound back exercise. It works out similar muscles to the barbell/pendlay row. $URL$ There are many isolation exercises for back (eg. Reverse Fly, Pull-over, Chins) but for a compound back exercise look towards: 

The estimated TDEE is just that, estimated. There are many other factors which can affect your BMR that those calculators don't take into account. Use a 2 week cycle to set a TDEE, eat at it and then measure the difference on the scale and in your energy levels/mood. IF you don't lose weight and feel good then reduce the calorie intake further and try for another 2 weeks. If you lose slightly over what you expect or feel awful then up your calorie intake a little. Your BMR is highly personal and cannot be "prescribed" using a calculator. At best it gives you a starting point. Go out and do some science. 

50 sets works out at 10 exercises for 5 sets, even if you discount warm-up sets that's only just above the average I see in my gym. 50% intensity is what I use on my deload days! That's not that hard. Don't keep the intensity the same and at such a low level. You should be really aiming for 60-90% intensity on weight training where at 60% you would be doing 8-15 reps and 1-5 reps at the higher intensity. It is currently asserted by a lot that people should lift 1-5 reps for strength, 8-12 reps for muscle size increase, and 15-20 reps for muscular endurance (Starting Strength says this). However, more recent research has demonstrated that almost every rep range stimulates the same amount of muscle growth so long as effort per set (i.e. closeness to failure) is the same between sets. In other words, a set of 50 reps taken to failure stimulates the same amount of muscle growth as a set of 5 reps taken to failure. Currently, evidence exists for loads as low as 20% of 1 repetition maximum and as high as 90% 1RM stimulating the same muscle growth, so long as effort per set and number of sets are similar. This actually concurs with old bodybuilding 'logic' because by utilising high rep schemes and lower weights, they can recover faster and train more. Which produces more muscular growth. However, performance-wise, you will improve the most in the rep ranges that you practice. If you mostly lift with 1-5 reps, you will mostly improve performance in the 1-5 rep range. If you mostly lift with 15-20 reps, you will mostly improve performance in that rep range. This is likely due to neural adaptations rather than differences in muscle growth; you are “studying” that specific rep range, so your nervous system learns to perform it the best. Summing up: You can train up to 6 times a week provided you carefully listen to your body and eat enough. If you work muscles in isolation then give them a day off afterwards. Change up your intensity and rep ranges based on your goals (and to stop things becoming boring). 

When we don't have enough oxygen in our system though exhaustion from physical exercise we slow down and/or stop. In extreme cases some may pass out due to lack of oxygenated blood supply to their brain. Wearing a mask restricts air flow and so will bring about exhaustion faster. To counter this your diaphragm will have to work harder and so over continued use this will lead to development of the diaphragmatic muscle. This my be more helpful for deep sea diving or similar breath activities but any data on this is anecdotal. There are few studies as to the effectiveness of the mask and I cannot find any scientific data but there are a number of personal reports on the effects of wearing these masks. Effectiveness of Masks 

So technically, yes. Based on the information provided you can achieve a 180kg bench at your bodyweight without the use of steroids or equipment (bench shirt). Though looking at the current 74kg category record holder, you are unlikely to achieve this without dipping down to below 14% bodyfat. As a general rule of thumb, you need to 'eat big' to 'lift big', a large calorie surplus will significantly help you progress your strength rapidly. 

Intermittant fasting works well. Caffiene is a appatite suppressant so black coffee or a cup of tea could be helpful. I find the following advice to be most helpful: "If you are hungry, drink a glass of water, if you are still hungry then consider eating an apple. If you are not hungry enough to deal with eating a apple then you aren't truly hungry. If you are, then eat the apple." 

As you are not sure what specific routine you want to follow and as you are practically untrained when it comes to weights you would benefit from the Stronglifts 5x5 routine. This routine teaches you the important movements, allows you to achieve a lot and then gives you the knowledge you need to transition onto a more specific program. 

Start with a supported hand stand (heels against a wall) Shift weight in handstand position to left and right hand Continue 2. but try to remove one hand at a time off the floor. Continue 3 but progress to shoulder taps. Attempt a HSPU but with a support and kip: With a mat for your head that is higher than your hands (higher it is the easier it will be), lower yourself into a headstand. Rest your butt against the wall and bring legs down to your chest, kick up and push up at the same time to kip yourself to the top position. Lower the mat to ground level. Remove the kip Feet off the wall at the bottom Feet completely off the wall Only let head brush the mat. Use paralettes to remove the headstand element. 

note: If you want advice about your specific running progression programme then that is a separate question. 

No. The caffeine content in a normal 330ml coke does promote thermogenesis through metabolic stimulation but the amount it does this is so small that it is negligible. Cold drinks do not cause you to expend significant amounts of energy heating them up either. If you want to know the amount of energy a drink will provide then just look at the caloric content on the label. 

The same way you would have built up your first 5k jog, using intervals. 'Jogging' would be your 5k-in-35-min pace 'Running' would be your 5k-in-20-min pace Start with a 4min jog, 1min run, 4min jog, 1 min run...etc. (repeat until you complete the 5k) Once that is comfortable then increase the run time by 1 minute and/or decrease the jog time by 1 minute. Repeat until you can do the whole thing at a 'run'. 

As question states, I can life a lot more on deadlift and squat by using a belt to brace against, why? Is it cheating? 

Fitness is all about YOU, you are aiming to beat only yourself and trying to hold yourself up to the standard of others only will result in disappointment. We can't all be the fastest/strongest but we can be faster/stronger than our past selves. Specifically, long distance running has a huge mental-only aspect to it. Having the mental grit/determination to carry on after the 10th mile requires a lot. You need to develop your "don't quit" attitude through practicing doing long-distance runs (10k/Halfs). This determination is highly personalised and what gets your through "the wall" depends on your goals and motivation. 

Eat more calories than you use and you will put on weight. With reference to gaining muscle by timing your meals: current evidence does not appear to support the claim that immediate (≤ 1 hour) consumption of protein pre- and/or post-workout significantly enhances strength- or hypertrophic-related adaptations to resistance exercise Just eat 5-15% above your TDEE with a sensible macronutrient split. 

No its not unhealthy, you will be fine at 1500. Don't bother trying to offset exercise. Focus on getting enough sleep and eating the right macro-nutritional breakdown, you should have energy to complete workouts. You probably burn a lot less than you think, it's highly individual and the only way would be to use a chest-strap heart rate monitor to work it out. Your strength workout is probably not breaking the 300 calorie mark. 

Downsides to a coach is they ONLY care about you succeeding in the competition. They will get you to only movements that will make you better at the sport. A running coach wont make you lift weights, a baseball coach doesn't care about how much you can deadlift. Cross-training is very much a dirty word to a lot of coaches. A experienced coach will know what will work best for you, what movements to practice and how to best get you to improve. You will probably have the same coach throughout your career as a developing athlete. They want you succeed as much as you do, everything is based around succeeding in competition. A coach isn't just a "fitness trainer" they are a part of your family/friendship circle. They will probably be at your wedding. I can't speak for all coaches but I have found this to be the majority. Non-Competition (With the exception of bodybuilding, where coaches aren't prevalent but competitions are) If you have someone doing the job of personal training and you have no competition the goals become a little less wholesome. Even with the goal of losing weight a PT quickly learns that their clients cannot out-exercise a bad diet. Some of the reasons people use PTs: 

Sounds like you are using the dumbbell to stabilise yourself but in a way that isn't great. Rather than using your stabilising muscles to help you pistol squat you are using a weight to offset the need for balance. The whole point of the pistol squat is really to develop stabilisation (more on this later). By using a 1-sided dumbbell you are potentially sabotaging your own progress. If you want to add weight onto the pistol squat then you should use either the arms straight position: 

How much will 1000 push ups a day help in losing body fat? Not enough to out exercise a bad diet, here is a great breakdown from quora on the amount of calories 50 press-ups do. 

My personal opinion? For a intermediate lifter integrate a combination of: Row (Pendlay, upright or other), Overhead Press, Reverse BB Fly and Shrugs/Lateral raises. Beginner lifters would be fine with just Overhead Press and Rows. Advanced lifters should know either what their body needs and/or should consult a professional trainer.
