Personally, I would quit, clean break, and just tell them as nicely as you can, "I love working for you, but its just wierd working for family. I need a more neutral relationship." Looking for new work secretely while working for someone else is dishonest. I realize people do this because they want security or do not want to miss income, but fundamentally it is dishonest. Since you sound like you have major no financial issues, there is no reason to keep working under false pretences and should just quit, THEN start looking for a new job. 

What's the issue? Maybe she is somebody's cousin. Who knows? It doesn't really matter. Just do not invite the problem to meetings and give it simple tasks. Basically pretend like the problem is not there. If your boss wants to keep paying her, that's his problem, not yours. 

It's a personal preference thing. Personally, I am a 24-hour kind of person, so I will respond by email as soon as I receive a message. Waiting until first thing the next business day is fine, too. The boss is not necessarily expecting you to drop everything and start working on a problem at 2am in the morning. He just has the item on his mind, so he is just letting you know as soon as he thinks of it. 

Giving birthday gifts at work I would classify as weird, unless you are in some country where that is normal. Just give her a card or wish her happy birthday. A physical gift is way overboard. 

There were no failures. We were writing software to add printing to the report generator [or whatever] and finished on time, a little early actually. The boss was very happy with it. Once again, no reason to even go there. 

The rule is that you only talk about personal stuff if the candidate brings it up first. So, if they list personal interests on their resume, then it is fair game. In your case, the video game is on the T-shirt, so it is fair game since they are advertising an interest in the game. If they have a public-facing website with both business and personal information then it is fair game. However, do not bring up any purely personal web site (like Facebook). Stuff on LinkedIn is fair game, Facebook and Twitter is not, unless the candidate is using those sites for business purposes. 

Earlier this year the Department of Labor issued more detailed guidance about what kind of computer-related employees can be considered exempt. This is the guidance: 

Definitely leave off anything that is irrelevant from your student days. When I get resumes from wanna-be software engineers that say things like "life guard" and "camp counselor" on them, that is a real turn off for me. It gives me the idea that they have no commitment to the profession or at least no serious interest. The guys I want to hire are the ones who were finding summer jobs as programmers when they were 13 years old. Once you graduate leaving stuff out is problematic because it leaves a gap. When I see a gap I assume the guy was probably in prison or something. But when you are a student, there is less need to account for your time, so omit anything that is not relevant to the job being applied for. 

Baptism of fire! It sounds like you hooked a big opportunity, but it may be just that: an opportunity not a job. The way business works at the top is YOU MAKE MONEY. That means getting people to write checks to you with lots of zeroes. Doing this is not a 9-to-5 job. You may used to just showing up having somebody tell you what to do, writing a few change orders, then going home. That is not how things are done at the top. At the top, you MAKE things happen, and if you do not, you are eliminated rapidly. In architecture, in particular, everything is about hooking big clients and keeping them happy. That means you need to be DYNAMIC and ENGAGING. Sounds like you failed in the first test. This guy didn't hire you to sit around writing change orders. He already has low-paid gumps to do that. He wants you to make money. You need to decide what you want to be: a partner who is working his ass off to do WHATEVER IT TAKES to make Mr. Buffet happy, or a 9-to-fiver who goes home to his family everyday at 4:30pm on the dot and watches sitcoms. It is possible your new boss grossly misjudged you, or just was optimistic, hoping you would some genius Steve Jobs-type visionary. Either way you need to judge yourself: what is my personality? Then match that to what role you assuming at your company. ---------------------- Additional info Just a comment about the specific situation that is the subject of the post... It was absolutely a mistake to go to a work meeting while you were still employed at your current company. Until your desk is cleaned out, you are an employee of the company and work only for that company. Going to a work meeting for some other company was a serious error. If you are wanting to be a partner, the days are ended where you get told what to do by someone else or blame someone else. So, blaming your new boss, oh he should not have asked me to that meeting. No! That is YOUR mistake. Clients and other partners will do crazy ass things all the time. As a partner your job is to FIX those things, not blame others for them. You should have told your new boss you cannot attend the meeting because you are still working for company XYZ. If a client or your boss tries to do something wrong or stupid, you need to figure out how to work it right, not go along with it. In the mailroom, standing up to somebody is called "insubordination" and you get fired for it. In the boardroom, it is called "backbone", and you bet your career on it and being right. 

When you have to answer psycho questions like that, it is not good. Ideally you want to get to the point in your expertise level where BS like that is not a factor. Unfortunately, when you are just out of school, there is not a lot to differentiate you from a million other similar people, so companies start making decisions based on nonsense trick questions like these, so let's take them one at a time: 

Just take the watch. Refusing it is a huge insult to the client... even if they don't know you refused it. The proper behavior is decline at first, then graciously accept the gift when pressed. Trying to "pay" for the watch is ridiculous. The watch was a gift. Trying to pay for gift is nearly as bad as refusing it outright. Have the watch mounted with a logo like "For Excellent Performance on Project XYZ" and put it in your office like a trophy. That way there is no question of impropriety. Places like Kinkos have business trophy centers where you can get mountings. 

My suggestion would be to try to get remote work where you communicate with the employer solely by e-mail. Trying to fight the system to get an in-person job is an exercise in futility. There are various job brokering systems and web sites like "Rent a Coder" that allow programmers to work freelance. An even better option would be to find someone in the United States or Britain to work with. There are many independent programmers who are hooked into lucrative contracts. In many cases these one man shops have more work than they can do by themself. If you find such a person you can offer to do their extra work. Also, there are various agencies and brokers in the US and Britain that connect independent contract programmers with clients. You can try to get established with those firms. 

I have only had one/two supervisors so far, and have not had occasion to disagree with them. In general, both were very reasonable people and the job I was doing was very straightforward, so I did not have any problems. Basically the same as the previous question. 

What would be their recourse? Sue you for not telling them? What are they going to do, sue you for $1 million? "Your honor, the defendant owes us a million bucks because she refuses to tell us the name of her new company (if any)." Or, better yet, try to get the judge to force you to tell them: "Your honor, will you please issue a court order compelling the defendant on pain of contempt to tell us which company she is now employed by." Somehow I do not see the court receiving such a petition with favor. 

Just ignore the suggestion that you "bring it forward" at the meeting. What does that even mean anyway? A "team meeting" is not the right venue for a business deal, and my guess is that your boss is not authorized to negotiate technology purchases for the company anyway. Generally, only the officers of a company can negotiate or make contracts for acquiring "new products". Working on outside projects is frowned on by most companies, especially if they think it may be taking time you otherwise would have spent on company projects. Unless your project is fully functional and marketable as it stands (which does not seem to be the case from your description), it is really just an idea, not dealable software. Therefore, the best procedure is to just drop it. If your boss asks about it (very unlikely), just say that it is in a very immature state of development. 

You are dealing with personality here. Everybody has a nature. A tiger has tiger nature. An cow has the nature of a cow. You have to accept the cards you are dealt and make the best use of them. With people you can fix small things, but changing someone's personality in fundamental ways is not possible. A lot of people will tell you different, and encourage you to put pressure on someone to change themselves. My experience is that doing that does not result in change, but just makes everybody more unhappy. The right strategy is to make the best use you can of each person and combine them to make chemistry. So, for example, in your case, maybe try to find someone who is plodding and methodical and pair them up with Mohan; Mohan does the flashy stuff, and when he skips over stuff, the boring guy does those other things.
