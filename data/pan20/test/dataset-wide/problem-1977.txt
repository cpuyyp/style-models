Display the time in all participating timezones Have each representative confirm their time Do that in a way that takes care of Daylight Savings or other unpredictable timezone changes 

You have to enter the system first to change it. If your way is not accepted, or even fairly evaluated, then that's the way it's gonna be. In time you'll establish your authority, stop being the new guy, and have your opinion heard more. Your manager said you need the buy-in of other developers, which means you have to be accepted by the pack. It it what it is. Now for some practical advice: Do they not like your variable names? Big deal, change them. Yes it's petty, but it keeps them off your back, and you don't have much political capital at the moment. Or if you want to mess with them, put in a ducky. The one I'd be worried about is the scope creep. Do the other devs have the authority to expand the scope? In any case, every time this happens inform your manager by email (make sure to include links or IDs or whatever your CR system uses). The point here is to get a paper trail which explains your delays. 

This question reads like a rant but I'll venture to answer it anyway. Without more knowledge on your situation (company culture, awareness of manager's incompetence by his manager etc.), and short of telling you to find another job, there's only one advice I can offer: Suck it up That's the gist of it. Here's a number of techniques that can help: 

This is clearly written for cases where the employee cannot perform their duties due to long-term illness, and no reasonable accommodation can be made for them (ie. not your case). </IANAL> 

If they respond with a figure below the market average you've already researched, you can use that as a lever instead. If their figure is too low then maybe you should start drafting your notice letter as well. Good luck 

For the vast majority of people there is no solid reason for not telling your current employer or coworkers. If there were some sort of agreement between the new and the old organization to not poach employees, the new employer would have told you about it. If they didn't they would soon realize that they were wasting their time and money interviewing employees from your company. If the current boss calls the new company and tries to sabotage your new position, that tells you that your current employer is not somebody you want to keep working for. Plus it opens the current company to a lawsuit. It also a bad sign if the new employer drops you based on a phone call from the one person has a conflict of interest regarding judging your ability to perform for the new company. Now you have to evaluate your individual situation, you have to decide how to inform people and not sound like bragging. You have to be sensitive to your current company and their workers when telling them you are leaving, and where you are going. Also don't resign until the paperwork and background investigations have been completed. Not telling your coworkers doesn't shield you from them trying to join you at the new company, unless you plan on dropping out of social media, and LinkedIn. 

Unless you were only there a few days there will be hole in your resume. In addition many companies will specifically ask you why you left each position. They may be using this determine why you leaves positions, they may also be using it to compare notes with what your old employer said. If you lie about it, they might catch you, and then they can fire you for not being truthful during the hiring process. You will need to be able to tell them why: inappropriate message written on a whiteboard, and you will have to show remorse. Your excuse that it wasn't a hate crime because "I didn't even know the guy" will prove that you still don't get it. 

I am in the process of designing my first batch of business cards and considering putting the phonetic spelling of my surname beside it, in a faded font. My surname is foreign (much like me). What I want to accomplish by doing so is giving new acquaintances the confidence to pronounce my name without worrying about getting it wrong. It's also a novel thing to do and I believe it could enhance first impressions by showing me to be thoughtful. Yet there are several problems I can see after thinking about it for a bit: 

I've got a freelance project that's technically finished but I'm waiting for the client to sort out domain registration, which could take up to a month. The deliverable website is available in a "lorem ipsum" state, not talking to the "real" DB but for all intents and purposes, functional. I'm short in experience so I decided to put that in my CV without including the link, just the description. The headhunter told me the CV is incomplete because of it, and I should add (or send him) the URL so his client can see it. 

Why is that? Weren't they looking at their website? The people supposed to look after it? I don't think that would be the case, but, from a game-theoretic perspective, not mentioning it at all is your safest bet. 

It may be that you're trying too hard. Jobfairs usually have a swarm of candidates and if a recruiter plays his cards right, he'll get the intern he wants. In that situation the table is tilted to the favour of them and the students with high marks. Same goes for summer internships. Try applying for positions a little higher than your mark, like those titled Junior or Graduate level. If you have solid demonstrable experience (say, a nice Github account) and approach companies that don't appear in jobfairs, you don't compete with your high-scoring student-mates anymore. You compete with the world. That may work to your advantage because chances are it takes you from average to average-high. Don't be intimidated, you'll know if you can cut it within the first month, and if you find yourself in a nice place, you may even continue working part-time through your studies. 

Many times the text boxes in the online form are asking for info on your resume/CV or cover letter. You have no idea if the reader will look at both so don't skip any sections. If the info from the uploaded document will fit in their text box, just use it. Be careful because the text box generally removes all formatting, so if the paragraph relies on formatting make sure it still looks good. 

You don't owe Company A anything until after you have signed and returned the contract. There are many things can can change between the initial interview, and the start date. This is true even if you thought you understood everything. Some companies will only have vague statements about benefits on their website. But you might not realize until they send you the contract that it doesn't include something. They might not have a good retirement plan, or the health insurance could be very expensive. You might find that the company wants to put you on a different project or move you to a different location. The contract should have an expiration date, and a method of accepting the contract. They will most likely followup in a day or two, to urge you to sign. If you want to see a contract from Company B you will have to get them to act fast, or risk having to make a decision at the last minute. When the deadline is reached for company A you will have to accept or reject the contract. If you reject or let it expire they will move on to the second candidate. If you accept they will wait a day or two and either inform the 2nd candidate the the position is filled, or try to find them a new position. If you switch to company B after accepting the contract from company A, they will be disappointed, or upset, but are unlikely to sue you. The exception is if they spent additional funds for a background check, or to move you, then they might want to recover damages. I did see one case where the employee accepted a position with the government, but the back ground investigation took over a year. When the government checked back with the employee, they discovered that they had accepted a another government job and didn't want to go with the first agency. The 2nd agency only took 30 days to complete the investigation. The penalty for backing out will be an inability to ever work for that group again. 

I didn't assume you were job-hopping, only that you were close to being perceived as doing so. Indeed three make a pattern and I only had two samples to go by. Arguably I could've made the first paragraph less ambiguous. But that was an aside anyway. The pattern I refer to (par. 2) is deduced by info you omitted: By not disclosing any conversation(s) with your manager at either job, I assumed none had occurred. The spirit of my answer was that you should talk to your manager before taking permanent measures, preferably without using terms like "I hate my job" 

All In The figure I arrived at is the UK median for my profession after removing the Junior prefix. I took a deep breath, added 5K to it and sent the email. I don't expect to get anywhere near it, but I thought whatever figure I asked for, it could only go down from there. This might have been a mistake, I'll update this answer accordingly in the coming days. Read Other Answers This is a rookie's experience asking for a raise for the first time. I hope it adds some perspective, but do take it with a pinch of salt. 

The phrasing above might not fly in South East Asia, which I'm guessing you're from, but you get the idea. This is good practice for people you can't just ask to send you an email, ie. your boss or a client. It makes sure you're both on the same page. A final point, you don't have to be told to use Jira (or any other ticket system) to actually use it. A few months ago I was the only one in my team using Mantis (before a company-wide switch to Jira) and I was using it as my personal to-do list. 

During my job hunt I noticed one or two companies asking for A-levels results. For those unfamiliar with the term, I understand it stands for Advanced Levels and it's the UK equivalent of two High-school senior years in America (but I might be wrong). In any case it has nothing to do with University transcripts, and the position which requires them is usually entry / graduate level.
