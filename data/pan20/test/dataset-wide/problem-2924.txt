Part of Marx's legacy was the realization that identity need not be passive. The International Workers movement he helped to fomented was perhaps the largest secular transnational identity formations on the planet. One need not be passive (or reactive) in the face of identity. We have the capacity to forge new ones, based on new lines in the sand, the communities we seek to establish. What he was fully aware of that perhaps many of his followers weren't was just the extent to which the politics of identity needed to be a continual struggle or effort if they were to succeed. And not as something separate from politics in general, but as a central feature insofar as it is a type of branding on individuals who can either be supporters or who can take on an opposing identity of the enemy of what you represent. 

Within the same "in-carnation" (the taking on of flesh) there is the birth and death of particular types of minds or personalities. One is conscious of each new incarnation in this concept of the reincarnated and thus would not necessitate amnesia. If one has a concept of reincarnation that implies a physical dying and being born as a same self in a new body, there may be quite a few other things that would need to be explained before we even got to the issue of absence of memory of previous lives. 

For me it helps to frame the topic from the central objective of his philosophy, which one might put as: the liberation of humanity from the enchainment of exploitative modes of production. If we assume this tenant, every act can be judged on the basis of whether or not it leads to greater liberation or greater exploitation. Identity politics is politics pure and simple, BUT the question from a Marxian standpoint is what interests the particular identity serves. Marx was adamantly against nationalist and racial identities, not simply because he disliked nation-states or had a hatred of racial classification theories, but because they both constitute a "superstructure" created by and reinforcing the production relations constituting the economic structure of society. They are epiphenomenal to what is "really" going on in capitalist modes of production. 

This comes close to committing a form of category mistake. Jo Wehler is just committing that, it looks, it is hard to say though, as he does not specify any reasoning in that answer. 

Being able to deceive people that x is y does not mean x is equal to y. E.g. Hologram An indeterminate process may be similar to a determinate process if you are taking and comparing samples without deciding before which sample to take. Like if I create take samples of card deck shuffled randomly, one of them will have all 52 cards in order. It might as well be that a person never does something that can differentiate free will from deterministic action. 

Burden of proof does not shift here. It is just that the person 2 is now in a fix. If he considers the authority valid, he might change his views. But you already said person 2 still doubts the claim. If he still doubts the claim then it means he still has problem with authority. In that case, he can reject authority. The situation is like this - Person 2 believes Y is valid authority (aka he should know this), yet does think Y is not right here. So he automatically rejects Y's authority by sticking to his belief and is fine in doing so. Or he may go with authority and change his views. Either way, burden of proof remains on person 1 all the time. As what is "valid authority" is generally subject-dependent, this is not as powerful an evidence. Person 1 is asking person 2 to provide evidence that authority is wrong. But even if person 2 attempts to do so, he has to first raise suspicion over authority's validity. Then, why he would go on a harder route to show evidence against authority when he is can take an easier path of rejecting authority? Consider this syllogism - 

From what I gather, for realists who are especially fond of a good old-fashioned Mathematical Platonism incorporated in their ontology, there seem to be two ways of getting at it. The first seems to be the need for truth-makers for mathematical propositions/truths, hence the positing of mathematical objects as abstract objects which serve as truth-makers. The other route is to marshal the Quine-Putnam Indispensability Argument, or some contemporary variation, and deduce their existence (am I right in thinking this is a deductive argument, or is it an abductive argument? Perhaps their are versions of both) by noting that the existential quantifier is a device for ontological commitment. First of all, am I mistaken in thinking that these represent some of the motivations for adopting/positing Mathematical Platonism? Secondly, are there any other motivations for adopting/positing Mathematical Platonism? 

Lately, I have been reading some of Quine's works on modality. I can't help but feel that many of his pronouncements on modality are wrong/misguided, although pinpointing exactly where is goes wrong is proving rather difficult. For instance, in The Problem of Interpreting Modal Logic and Reference and Modality, he seems to defines necessity as follows: 

I realize that Seamus has already mentioned the classic criterion proposed by Quine, but I think Seamus may have slightly misrepresented it; so I thought I might add a few more details. It is true that Quine famously states "to be is to be the value of a variable" in is seminal paper "On What There Is." But I think it is slightly inaccurate to say that Quine thought that whatever exists is whatever is referenced/quantified in our best scientific theories, that the set of existing things just is the set of all that is quantified in our scientific theories. Here's what Quine says: 

As the two other answers suggest (Frank Hubeny's and Elliot Svensson's), there is, perhaps, some slight ambiguity in using the word 'save'. If by save you mean preventing their suffering and death, then one response available to the Christian is countering with a free will defense, most notably elaborated by Alvin Plantinga, which Frank Hubeny alluded to. If instead you mean redeem or extend salvation to, which is the more plausible interpretation given your mention of sin and innocence, then one could deny the presupposition undergirding your question--namely, that God didn't save them. On this interpretation, the Christian might respond by saying, "Given the traditional conception of God as a perfect being which Christians endorse, God is wholly just or fair, so that not extending salvation to such innocent younglings would be unjust and therefore impossible for God to do." This might be deemed a more 'philosophical response', as it doesn't fully appeal to Christian scriptures (it appeals to scriptures insofar as scriptures affirm perfect being theology). Or a Christian might respond by appealing to scripture to explain how exactly one might receive salvation without knowledge of Christ, which Elliot Svensson has nicely outlined for us. 

Investments (of which the investment of time and resources into research is an example) of any sort are weighed on two things generally: risk and opportunity. Taboo is relevant only insofar as it MIGHT open risks to which the investor may have to account for. When an investor sees opportunity outweighing risk (e.g. likelihood of a significant finding or development), the decision tends to make itself. If someone is interested in taboo for the sake of taboo but not for a weighted probability for reward, there tends to be no motive for an investor to place resources towards that. The key in is always in demonstrating a solid basis, logic and grounding for the research. 

For Epicurus, the problem with the fear of death is the same as with any other sort of fear for him. It is firstly an obstacle to knowledge. One has to remember that he grounds his Ethics with a Physics. He's interested in things as they are as that helps us live the good life. To obtain knowledge one has to look for adequate causes of phenomena, not fear phenomena. And the knowledge isn't just for mental consolation purposes but to know how to deal with it. If one doesn't know how to swim, we see water and immediately sense fear, because that water presents a danger to us. Adequate knowledge allows us however to understand our relations with water and with practice we can come to work with it, to learn to swim. Fear is contrasted to learning, to curiosity. It's recoiling, as opposed to a careful "working-with". The second problem of fear (in general) is that it is the single greatest cause of man's misery (under the guise of anxiety). This constant fretting over future "what-ifs". So if one has as the central purpose of one's philosophy, showing man how to attain ataraxia (true equanimous happiness), one must attack fearful dispositions head-on. Death is not a special category in this framework, but a central component, treated in the same way as one treated the fear of Gods. Fear of death comes from 1) our relationship with our infinite capacity for desire, and 2) improper understanding (superstitious understanding) of the natural phenomena of death. It is, for him, only through working with natural understanding of ourselves and of life that we learn to pare down desire, make it come into alignment with knowledge of the universe and eliminate the fear of death. Without that one doesn't experience true life-pleasure or true happiness. 

We should not believe in Y's claims only if there is evidence against them Y claims X There is evidence against X Hence we should not believe in X 

SUMMARY It might be hard to correctly say what is a metaphor and what isn't. But there can be justifications given as to why a piece of text is considered metaphor and this decision is not arbitrary. I just scratched the surface of the debate that happens among Christians over it. You can easily find in-depth analyses on the net. However, your question is hardly a concern because even if large parts are deemed metaphorical while keeping smaller parts as literal, it does mean that the parts that are found to be metaphorical are not exactly true and accepted to be as such. So if a person is not deliberately (and arbitrarily) classifying some parts as literal and others as metaphor, it should not be viewed as dishonesty because he is not claiming that to be true what he knows to be false. It should be viewed at best (or worst) as a frantic attempt at shielding core beliefs which is not different than refining a scientific theory by chipping away parts that are unconvincing. 

The major disagreement on beauty comes from not a disagreement on beauty but relative perception of such due to other factors. For example, when looking at a scenery, you may evoke certain memories which may lead you to classify something more beautiful than you would have if there were no memories attached to it. If you strip beauty of those definitions that encompass subjective perceptions arising from subject's own emotions, then beauty tends to looked at as objective rather than subjective. 

There is an external world and there is us. Our illusions do not change external world but can change our own state of mind and thus our attitude, behaviour, and responses to situation. Now, if illusion produces a result that makes us more adaptable to our surroundings, then it might be considered to be desirable (pragmatically). A very good and often used example is that if you have fear of speaking in front of large crowds then you must imagine that the room is empty. This lowers your anxiety and thus helps you speak better because your own anxiety was making you less adaptable to the situation (where best thing for you would obviously be to speak). Some would say that this is not exactly going against reality but actually diminishing an irrational and unreal fear by thinking of contrast. Here, I am reminded of Victor Frankl's book, "Man's Search For Meaning". In the second part "Logotherapy in a Nutshell", he talks about antcipatory anxiety. It is according to him counterable by paradoxical intention. It is not exactly creating an illusion though. The point is in order to remove a fear, best thing would be not to think it. Thinking about it makes you aware of it even more and that causes a viscious cycle of action and reaction (a sort of system with a positive feedback greater than unity) that results in hyper-sensitisation to the problem and thus more severe symptoms. That would require either understanding its extent and not over-reacting or ignoring or thinking of something else, or thinking the event to be something else. Sometimes, the last option is most easy and immediate. However, the illusion may actually cause more problems. Thinking that there is no one in room, you may blurt out something that the audience may not like or is improper, hence ruining everything. Because our reactions to the world may not always be in a way that best ensure our interests (because of mental factors and the fact that we can think) and the very fact that what is does not mean what ought to be, sometimes it is better pragmatically to artificially produce those responses, by changing the mental factors, that are best according to our needs and interests. Determination of that requires extensive understanding in itself. However, if it is possible then it is an option. However, if you specifically want to aks why people choose an illusion over reality and not whether and when they should choose it, well that is question related mostly to psychology and not philosophy. Illusions appear real. You have to work to see through them, What would be an incentive for a person to do something which would take away from him what is making him happy? And even if there is some, some people might ignore it if it is not clearly visible to them. It is not surprising that some people refuse to work (apply extra thinking) to make themselves unhappy (or so they feel).
