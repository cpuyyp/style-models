Thinking on this varies over time and, in view of the subject, and sometimes because of entirely non-scientific thinking. My understanding is that we think life (e.g. microorganisms) ought to be pretty common, and intelligent life fairly common. There is a school of thought that, including dolphins, there's only one intelligent life form on Earth. YMMV. There's a good discussion on this subject on the PBS Space Time channel on YouTube. They had some related discussions here and here. I think overall there is a general view that we expect there to be other intelligent life and (relatively speaking) lots of it. The questions of why we can't detect it or it doesn't seem interested in us if such life exists are dealt with to some extent in those PBS Space Time videos. I'd describe the whole problem as an open one at this stage. 

We certainly do not know that. It contradicts your original statement, but there's been no evidence found of life anywhere except on Earth ( to date ). There are many theories saying life probably exists ( in some basic form, like cells ) outside of Earth, but they are simply theories at this point. Science is not about excepting theories without evidence, it's about theories fitting evidence. At this point we have no theories on life outside Earth that we have evidence to back. 

Maps of the upcoming solar eclipse show a band representing the path of totality with a line more-or-less down the center. My question is: what exactly does that line represent, and to what degree of accuracy (cms, meters, kms) is it calculated? Is the center line a projection of the Moon's barycenter on Earth's geoid? On Earth's physical surface (taking local altitudes into account)? Is it the center of area of the lunar disc as observed from Earth? Is it something else? 

We know that the Earth, like a top, slowly precesses as it rotates. We know the Sun rotates, but does it precess as well? What about planetary orbits? Is the orientation of the ecliptic stable or will its inclination change over time? If so, would the orbital inclinations of the planets currently in the ecliptic change independently or in unison? We know the ecliptic is inclined with respect to the galactic plane. Would that have been a consequence of "residual" angular momentum when the solar system formed, or did it gradually take up its present orientation? 

The mirrors, clock and you are all in the same reference frame and your relative velocities are zero. The speed the whole shebang is traveling at relative to something else is irrelevant. So the clock on board the ship with you will calmly pass the seconds just as you'd expect an object at rest relative to you to do. 

The moon has dark and bright areas. When it is visible in the daytime the bright areas appear roughly as bright as clouds, but the dark areas have no light to add to the scene and we are just left with the blue light from the sky generally. The sky blue is not as bright as the clouds or the moon, at least when it's visible like this (typically near the end of day and early morning) so it does not conceal the bright clouds or the moon's brighter parts. 

That's meaningless. All light is electromagnetic radiation. A finite part of the infinitely large range of the electromagnetic spectrum is visible light. So you should talk about EM radiation and to discuss the visible spectrum just say visible spectrum. Stars emit lots of energy at frequencies that are outside the visible range. 

Are there orbits with long-term stability (astronomical time scales) around Earth? Low altitude orbits will decay due to friction with Earth's atmosphere. Inside Earth's Roche limit, a Moon could not form anyway due tidal forces. At altitudes closer to that of the Moon, the Moon would presumably destabilize an orbit such that the object would either collide with Earth or the Moon or be ejected. Many of the other planets in our solar system have multiple natural satellites; where this occurs, they are always vastly smaller than the primary - think of Jupiter, Saturn, and even Mars. On the other hand Earth, and apparently Pluto, each has only one natural satellite, relatively large in comparison to the primary. Is this because a large satellite will tend to clear the entire "sphere of influence" around its primary of any other material? So my question is: does the existence of our Moon effectively prevent the formation or capture of any other natural satellite around Earth? (Considering only true satellites, not "companion" objects or quasi-satellites) 

If we imagine a sphere of radius one light-year centered on Earth, it contains only one star - our Sun. If we imagine a sphere of radius ten light-years centered on Earth, it contains about 10 stars, according to this wikipedia page. If we imagine a sphere of radius one hundred light-years centered on Earth, about how many stars would it contain? If we imagine a sphere of radius one thousand light-years centered on Earth, about how many stars would it contain? 

Is Earth the perfect place for life ? If it isn't then how could conditions be better here ? For example, the size of the Planet, our atmosphere, distanace from our Sun etc. 

I heard on a you tube video that a new theory came out in 2015 . The theory is that there was no "Big Bang" and that the Universe has no beginning . 

I watched a documentary where I heard some very strange theories that are difficult for me to comprehend. It is even difficult for me to explain what I heard. "Objects that fall into a black hole leave a copy of themselves outside the black hole." "We are not living in reality but in a hologram ." Does any of this make any sense to anyone ? O.K. so I went to check the title of this documentary because how can anyone explain it without knowing what I saw. "Fingerprints of God -the Dark Universe" this is the title. I do admit that I did sleep through a good part of it because it was almost 2:00 a.m. Also if anyone wants to watch it then look for it on youtube because that is where I saw it. 

An ellipse does indeed have two foci, but the orbits of planets and the motion of the Sun are not quite ellipses anyway. But even if we ignore these small deviations from an ellipse, each planet's orbit is in a different orientation and has different foci. 

Given that we have very few examples, we could not, statistically, draw any significance from any apparent bias. It's also hard to see any theoretical basis for expecting a bias, so my gut feeling would be there probably is no bias. It's also worth remembering that human observations of these things are essentially a very brief snapshot in a huge period during which we have no idea about what may have been happening. So again the statistical significance of what happens at the moment needs to be carefully considered. 

Your understanding of the mass of anti-particles is likely the problem. They have positive mass, just like particles, because they are particles. 

Long before we had any serious science of astronomy, we had seasons. We defined a year as being four seasons. All you need to do that is long term memory. Once you can count and record events in some way, you start counting days. As we accumulated knowledge of the stars, we noticed that the changes of positions of the stars in the heavens followed very regular cycles. That gave us a way to relate a year to an exact number of days ( and in fact to a fraction of a day ). When we developed physics enough to be able to associate the yearly cycle with an orbital cycle we changed our definition of year to be exactly that cycle ( and we even allow for slight changes in that's cycle's length ). So we invented the approximate year first and then refined it to match our understanding of physics. 

The local weatherman declared that fall starts at exactly 10:21am (local time). Ignoring the fact that seasonal boundaries have multiple definitions (meteorological, astronomical, etc.), what he perhaps means to have said is that the fall equinox occurs at that moment. Presumably, that is the moment at which Earth's axis of rotation is exactly perpendicular to the Sun-Earth line. My question is: to what degree of precision can this be measured? The weatherman's statement was to the minute. But is it actually measured to a finer precision? If so, plus or minus how many seconds? What about the the solstices? Can they be measured to the same degree of accuracy? Are there factors which uniquely affect the accuracy of either measurement? 

The evolutionary path of the Sun has been described in some detail, and, subtle differences aside, it's been described as such for decades - the Earth-engulfing red giant stage, the helium flash, etc.. It would seem that the knowledge necessary to make such a prediction has been around since the 60s, if not earlier. How do we know it will happen, and on the timescales described? If we make some measurements/estimations of the mass and composition of the Sun, and use our understanding of nuclear physics - energy of fusion and so forth, and an understanding of Newtonian physics (or do we have to invoke Einstein?), do the predictions just inevitably fall out? Could the predictions be wrong? Is there any significant measure of uncertainty, perhaps due to sensitivity of certain calculations to initial conditions, etc? Is the red giant future of our Sun a firm conclusion, or just a likely possibility among a range of others and commonly talked about merely because it seems the most likely one? 

Carl Sagan in Cosmos did suggest one argument I recall. The gravitational force between say Jupiter (the most significant planet gravitationally) and a child born in a hospital is less than the gravitational force the doctor delivering the baby exerts on the child. Which is a good enough argument for me. :-) Regarding proving Astrology false, the problem is that Astrology produces vague predictions open to vast interpretation, even interpretations which are contradictory. You can't "disprove" something when the claims made can be arbitrarily changed. It goes something like this : Scientist : Give me a precise event your astrology predicts. Astrologer : Well X will happen when Y astronomical event occurs. Time passes ... Scientist : Well, event Y happened, but not your predicted event X. That proves your astrology is nonsense. Astrologer : No, it means my interpretation of the signs was wrong. Let me try again. There is no way to win, because astrology is a game where the dealer can change your cards any time they like. 

You understand wrong. It is considered the weakest of the fundamental forces. This Physics SE answer explains why. It appears to be strong only because on average, over a large scale, matter is generally neutrally charged, whereas mass (and energy) just gets bigger the more space you have (a little simplistic, but that's the general idea). As for "consistent", well all the forces behave consistently or we would not be able to model them with mathematics.
