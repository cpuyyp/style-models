They assign each city a “revenue” number, possibly scaled according to population, and the size of your economy is the sum of the value of all your cities. This is somewhat realistic because in postindustrial countries (i’m assuming from you saying the game is “sci-fi”), cities are vastly wealthier than rural areas. If you want to make the model slightly more sophisticated, you can multiply the value of your cities by trade between it and the other cities in a country, so a clever player can tank an opponent’s economy by blockading the links between the cities instead of conquering or destroying the cities themselves. However if conquest is something you want to have a lot of in your world, this is probably not the way to go, because physical territory is basically irrelevant here. In the real world, capturing a city is a gruesome and blood-drenched endeavor, and often results in the destruction of much of the prize itself. Scads of resistance movements throughout history have also proven that you don’t need to control cities to maintain a war machine. They tie the economy to the natural resources in the land (food, coal, oil, steel, etc.) and the economy is basically backed by the physical commodities within a country’s territory. This is hugely unrealistic (otherwise Venezuela would be one of the richest countries in the world!) but it has the upside of being simple for players to understand, and can be somewhat accurate if the main focus of your world is warfare, where the basic resources matter much more relative to higher-level goods than they normally would in a civilian economy. 

Keep in mind that we need a policy for who goes in the bunker, not just case-by-case judgments for the example characters given in the question. We need to select among thousands of candidates, each one as idiosyncratic as the few examples given. If case-by-case judgment is really the best way to go, we need to know how to set up the vetting process to minimize cries of “bias!” and whatnot. If there is a reviewing panel, who gets to sit on it, and what rubric are they given? Do members of the panel themselves automatically get to go? We need a legitimate (it does not need to be fair, but must be at the least perceived as legitimate) system to sort out all the people like them, keeping in mind that there is limited space available. While no policy is perfect, we need one that will result in the most optimal outcome; for example, if we say “take your spouse at the time of the apocalypse”, do we let Rachael and Dianna get married right before the comet hits, with the cost of letting Lil’ Marco tag along (he “marries” Shifty Steve)? How do we account for relationships that might be just as essential for the psychological well-being of the survivors, but might not count as traditional “kin”? 

I want to have an Earth-sized planet (with similar gravity) with an extremely low-density atmosphere (comparable to Mars) at most of its surface. Complex life, including an information-age civilization, lives in enormous sinkholes many kilometers across, some up to 100 km across. Due to the lower elevation, the air pressure and composition is comparable to Earth‘s. The sinkholes are flat on the bottom and have vertical-ish walls, so they’re shaped like carved-out cylinders. The planet has many such giant sinkholes, and they’re connected by underground rivers. Is this realistic? 

Deliberate reforestation programs, also a hallmark of advanced industrialized governments, also contribute a large amount. In terms of carbon emissions, it’s not clear what the net effect would be. The loss of our delicately-recovering global forests would take away a major carbon sink, while the collapse of energy-intensive human activities would also take away a major carbon source. However, we do know that “civilization” in the western sense is not a prerequisite to massive ecological and climatic damage. Contrary to popular depictions in cartoons, it is believed that the Native Americans were so destructive to the environment, that when Columbian diseases decimated their population, the absence of their emissions and the recovery of their environment plunged the Earth into the Little Ice Age of the 16th century. It’s also important to note that The Environment™ is also much, much more than simple carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere. Things like biodiversity and healthy ecosystems are all critically harmed by human land use. 

From this, it seems that the best example we have is the vehicle. If aliens have eyes at the front, and find backing up or turning around in confined spaces to be awkward, perhaps from being long (someone suggested centaurs) or from being spined or shelled, then they are likely to build houses in a circular fashion, with a round central courtyard, then a corridor inside, then rooms arranged for suitable flow of movement around that corridor, each with an in and an out door. Their lives would be set up to facilitate this: different rooms at different times of day, perhaps following the sun. Operations like making a coffee would be arranged as linear process flows along the countertop. Causing someone else to have to back up or turn way would be considered rude. Perhaps all houses are "clockwise", or perhaps different cultures are set up to flow around their houses in opposite ways. Perhaps they alternate on each level. Perhaps some are figure-8 or cloverleaf. The important thing is that people can flow easily around their property without having to turn in place, or obstructing others (thus, passageways should be wide enough for two to walk abreast). 

But I'm bending the term "tentacle" there, to include all prehensile (="grasping") things other than hands. The list of prehensile things includes (non-exhaustive list): 

Wouldn't a plausible explanation be "the only one in your list which even exhibits this is the anthropocentric one." 

If humans can be argued to have two hearts (because four lobes), then an example of, essentially, six hearts in a human-sized mammal is the horse. Now, this is NOT a humanoid, but the same requirements that require it to have frogs in its feet could drive development of lower-limb hearts in bipedal creatures. In fact, it's even a little surprising that, once we became bipedal, we did NOT develop something like this - instead we had to develop considerably improved blood supply structures to the brain to prevent blacking out when we stand up, and it's still a problem for many of us. One of the many small things that somewhat supports the aquatic ape hypothesis, I feel. So in short; yes, additional hearts or compressible chambers around the body, either mechanically operated (in sole of foot or back of knee) to automatically cause movement to push blood around the body, seems like it would definitely be an advantage in any large-brained biped which had to switch between long periods of lying prone and periods of rapid dashing. 

Security experts recommend "Defense in depth", and "Multi-layer security". Plus, it makes the system more interesting to describe to the reader. So you could use several different devices or systems to achieve all your ends. While all a bit scifi-esque, here are some ideas at least a little less of a hand-wave than "forcefield". 

In general, it seems more interesting to me to have the vulnerabilities caused by magic be the cause of the downfall, rather than have it be something completely unrelated like a meteorite impact or something. Because those vulnerabilities make for more depth to the magic, which can be explored and exploited in the story. 

Also, brains. Blacking out is inconvenient. A separate chamber or entire heart devoted purely to feeding blood to the brain seems like it would be useful anywhere that blood pressure to the head will often change significantly, whether by changing attitude (stand/lie), acceleration, or injury. So you could argue that Klingon-type warrior races would likely have brains protected by a very thick skull and a largely isolated blood supply, the better to survive in combat for longer; as might flying bipeds that pull high g-forces. 

Being bipedal also gives us hernias, instability, inability to run from predators for years, hip, back, and circulatory problems that quadrupeds don't have, agonizingly painful childbirth, and so forth: from a medical point of view, the changes to our body that were required for bipedalism are an absolute disaster. 

So, in general, it seems best, when looking at the past, to assume that things will NOT change, unless there's a clear sign that technology must inevitably change things. What technology could come along that will make shipping obsolete? Better roads? But if the factories already exist by the rivers/dams for cooling, and for proximity to power generation, surely the rivers will remain the best way to get the materials to the factories, and to get the output away? Any visit to any lake or beach in the US on the weekend will tell you that there will never, ever be a day, in any conceivable future, where pleasure craft will be obsolete. Instead, what we can guarantee is that the existing plethora of designs will be joined by newer ones as the tachnologies advance. But there'll still be people who like a sailing dingy, or a kayak, not because, nowadays, they are any more practical than an inflatable dingy with an outboard motor, or a jet-ski, but because they are more pleasurable. These places, as populations rise, just become more teeming with craft, not less. Same with cruises, and yachts. So if shipping, cruises, yachts, and small recreational craft still exist, what does that leave, to get rid of? Passenger craft is one - in Bangkok, taxi-boats ply the canals, but they wouldn't be needed if the canals were paved over. But why would people do that? The canals bring business and shipping and look nice and provide drainage in floods. So, odds are the small canal-taxis will continue to exist, even if their drivers become automated. Ferries are still used where there are no toll-free tunnels or bridges, and people want to take something heavy, like their car, to their destination. What about larger passenger ships? Well, long distance, that service has by and large been replaced by planes already. People coming to the US from Europe now fly, rather than take a ship. Overall, I can't see any technology which will further remove water craft. [Edit: 

Suppose we have an intelligent alien who has landed on Earth and has somehow found his way into a human high school math class (for the sake of scenic stability, the alien has the ability to cloak itself as a human form). The typical trope is the alien finds the human math elementary, and quietly chuckles to himself about how primitive humans are. Sometimes the alien, when interacting with his human friends, mutters advanced mathematical equations to himself, which goes right over the humans’ heads. In our high school math class, the alien gets called up to the board and sometimes inadvertently fills up the entire blackboard to the shock of the human teacher. For example, in the Animorphs series, there’s a line where Ax (an alien posing as a human teen) says in a train of thought: 

Keep in mind nuclear weapons (like aircraft carriers) don’t necessary need to be captured or neutralized by the rebels for them to win. The thing is, big weapons require big targets. For your future government’s nuclear weapons to do them any good, the rebels would have to all be concentrated in a few small parts of the country (like a few cities). This generally isn’t the case when it comes to insurrections. You don’t want to send a nuke to kill one rebel at a time. 

I don’t think so. Aircraft carriers are tricky things to get close to, even with more advanced technology. (Terrorists have successfully hit smaller ships, like destroyers, though.) However, this could also be because most of the countries that have aircraft carriers are also stable enough to avoid civil war that produces rebel fighters in the first place. 

This is an old question so I am surprised no one mentioned it, but what about individuals with large social networks versus individuals without large social networks? As society evolves to depend more and more upon how many social connections or “friends” one has, this is increasingly creating divisions and advantages between the “popular” and the “unpopular”. In a hyper-democratized medium like the internet and social media, those with more followers have proportionately more influence, and thus more power than those with fewer followers. In the future (and arguably now), this translates into real monetary and economic advantages too—just think about the term “professional networking“. The economic advantages conferred to the popular even extend to simple twitter and instagram followers—not too long ago, a clothing store called OnePiece made headlines by offering selective discounts to people based on how many social media followers they had. The idea was to gain goodwill among the “influences” of social media. To my knowledge, they are still doing that to this day. In some industries like modeling, having a large number of followers on one’s personal Instagram account has become a job prerequesite. A very interesting book that explores this concept is Extras by Scott Westerfeld. In this world, humans, in order to ration the use of resources (to preserve the environment), have established an economy where popularity is literally currency. Having more mentions (retweets, likes, followers, etc on social media in this universe) increases your social “face-rank” which determines the proportion of the community’s resources you are allotted. The idea is to encourage creative work and to place a premium on intellectual property and celebrity in a post-industrial society where “production” is no longer relevant to human happiness. 

On Earth, nuclear weapons can wreak enormous damage to a country and for that reason, large-scale wars between nuclear powers don’t happen. But what would happen if humanity progressed just enough to the point where countries expanded into space? Now powerful countries have fleets of spaceships (not fantastically advanced; no faster than light travel, no freak handwavium weapons; just what we might conceivably have within a century or so). Humans live scattered across the solar system, and have nations somewhat independent of Earth. Would large-scale, territorial war again become common in this scenario? Would nuclear weapons fail to pose an effective MAD deterrent effect? For the sake of a specific scenario to work with, consider two space powers, The Selenation, and Arianaland. They are both fierce rivals, and maintain hundreds of space stations scattered across the solar system. They have no strictly-defined borders, but each is concentrated in one broad area of the solar system, and have a region of space that they vaguely regard as their “territory”. They have ground colonies on large moons and asteroids, but there is a roughly comparable distribution between the “rock-bound” population and the space population. The “rockies” aren’t trapped on the surface per se; they regard moving into space as about as big a deal as moving house from the city to the suburbs. Neither country is tied to Earth, which is ruled by a third country Lovatoland and is regarded as something of a backwater. There are countless smaller powers across the solar system, most of which have a small territory carved out in one corner or another. The technology level is not unrecognizable from what we have today. Their ships are about at the same level of what could be built in the movie Interstellar, only each country has more resources to build a greater quantity of them. Travel is still slow, and moving between stations within each country takes months—it’s common, especially among members of the military, but it’s considered a “big voyage” (like interstate travel in the US in the 19th century). There is substantial communication infrastructure, and the internet exists, but it’s somewhat balkanized due to the fact that it takes up to an hour for signals to make the jump between “clusters”. Would Arianaland and the Selenation be quick to go to war with one another? Would we see something similar to the perpetual battles between Britain and France in the 18th and 19th centuries, only played out in space instead of at sea? Would nuclear deterrence only be a passing phenomenon, from back when humanity was jammed together on the same planet? Since this might be seen as too broad, let’s say that the question is simply would large-scale territorial war be conceivable in this scenario?
