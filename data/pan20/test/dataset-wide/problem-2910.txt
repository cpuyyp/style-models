The fallacy that is made by person B is the fallacy that is known as ignoratio elenchi, which is Latin for "ignoring criticism", but is a fallacy wherein, for any pair of interlocutors interlocked in an argumentational dialectic, interlocutor A states X and interlocutor B responds to X with a statement that is immediately irrelevant to X such that B "misses the point". 

Next, is the analytic-synthetic distinction. Analytic statements are those in which the subject's concept strictly implies the predicate's concept, and synthetic statements are those in which the subject's concept does not imply the predicate's concept. I'll give examples distinguishing analytic from synthetic: 

"They each want that" either is true or false, but the more interesting question is: "Why are statements sentences expressing one's opinion?" A simple example would be, "either it is saturday or it is not saturday." This statement, the truth of which seems to be self-evident, actually is expressing an opinion that affirms to be true the principium exclusi tertii sive medii inter duo contradictori. It is asserting the belief that "a statement either is true or is false". Thus, any statement of bivalent logic with a truth value that depends on principium contradictionis (i.e. any statement with a truth value that depends on principium exclusi tertii sive medii inter duo contradictori) rests on, if not reduces to, an opinion about truth and logic that principium contradictionis is a true logical principle. 

Money is a commodity. If the price of 1 cow is 30 chickens then the ratio is 30:1. Similarly, if the price of a shirt is $40 then the ratio of dollars to shirts is 40:1, which is to say that 40-dollars can be exchanged for 1 shirt. Money is consumed gradually like capital, but what makes money different from most other commodities is that it is consumed, gradually, by the process of exchange rather than by repeated employment in production processes. 

Whereas mathematics proceeds by deductive inference, science characteristically proceeds by inference to the best explanation. The particular kind of inference that characterizes a truth-seeking pursuit is why a distinction between math and science is important. If two explanatia for the same explanandum are equally probable then, by virtue of lex parsimoniae, the less ontologically superfluous of the two is the better explanation. An example can help to illustrate how science differs from math in that it infers to the best explanation rather than deduces. Lightning is more/less likely in places with higher/lower atmospheric convection than others yet, regardless of whether or not Zeus makes any lightning at all, it is most likely that there is lightning today if Zeus makes lightning whenever he is mad and if Zeus is mad today. Yet, it is implausible that "Zeus makes lightning whenever he is mad and he is mad today" truly explains that there is lightning today, because it is highly improbable that Zeus is mad today (regardless of how likely it would be that that there is lightning today if Zeus makes lightning whenever he is mad and if he is mad today). A no less plausible explanation for the lightning today (than an argumentum ad Jove) is that today's lightning was the making of unintelligent natural phenomena, which is plausible because it probably is a fact due to it being true a posteriori on many prior known occasions (whereas "Zeus makes lightning whenever he is mad and he is mad today" is not and has never been known a posteriori). Moreover, "unintelligent natural phenomena" makes for a better explanation than an argumentum ad Jove because, by virtue of Ockham's Razor, although Zeus might make lightning daily by increasing atmospheric convection daily, to include Zeus in an explanation (of how a natural phenomena caused the lightning today) is unnecessary to explain, sufficiently, today's lightning, which necessarily requires some mention of natural phenomena but does not necessarily require any mention of Zeus. It would be excessive to appeal to Zeus; argumentum ad Jove is not as ontologically parsimonious. On the topic of the social sciences, I think it's a mistake to think that the social sciences, in general, employ methodology inferior to that employed in natural sciences. Evolutionary biology, historically, has borrowed heavily from economics. "The ultimate subject matter of biology and economics is one, viz., the life process" (Daly 1968). Toward the end of the Enlightenment-era, economics began to find a place for itself in the life sciences. Carolus Linnaeus described all life as an 'economy of nature' (Linnæo 1749) and Erasmus Darwin had written of an 'economy of vegetation' (E. Darwin 1791). Post-Enlightenment, the Linnaean imagery was adopted by Charles Robert Darwin, a grandson of Erasmus Darwin, who went so far as to employ the Malthusian population principle from classical political economics (see Malthus 1798) as the architecture for designing his theory of natural selection (see C. Darwin 1860). "Darwin has interested us in the history of nature's technology, i.e., in the formation of the organs [that] serve as instruments of production for sustaining life" (Marx 1887). Ronald A. Fisher, a protégé of political economist Leonard Darwin (who was a son of Charles R. Darwin), unified the Darwinian bioevolutionary theory of natural selection with the Mendelian genetics and, in doing so, he had employed a plethora economics concepts (see Fisher 1930). Fisher even considered the inheriting of household wealth by offspring from their parents to be an extension of a more generalized inheritance process stemming from the inheriting of genes by the offspring from the parents, which is a notion that foreshadowed the Dawkinsian theory of the extended phenotype (see Dawkins 1978). "In organisms of all kinds the young are launched upon their careers endowed with a certain amount of biological capital derived from their parents" (Fisher 1930). The adoption of economics by the life scientists had an influence on economists as well. The application of economics to the life sciences, in turn, resulted in a strong influence from the life sciences on economic theory (e.g. evolutionary and behavioral economics). In fact, Alfred Marshall considered economics to be "biology broadly interpreted" (Marshall 1922). With the influx of physics into the life sciences, recently culminating with the noteworthy work by Jeremy England (2013), it is only reasonable that the torch of progress in economic thought now has been passed on to econophysics. 

Only the A-series has direction, but the A-series (according to McTaggart) has no order without the C-series. The conjunction of A-series and C-series produces the B-series. "Beginning" is a B-series concept because it refers to that which comes before all else in time. Yet, B-series depends on A-series and C-series. According to McTaggart, A-series ordering is essential to the reality of time such that, likewise, A-series is essential to the reality of beginnings. Therein, the reality of beginnings depends on the reality of time. I will not take a position either way, but I implore you [impersonal pronoun] to read McTaggart's "The Unreality of Time" and make a judgment on the matter for yourself. ~ Much more generally, if beginnings exist then, categorically, time exists, and if time begins then something that begins exists, but whether or not anything other than time has a beginning is a separate matter. Additionally, whether or not something that exists is real is another matter entirely (and one that is quite relevant for a realist). In keeping with Kantian thought, the position expressed herein is that existence/being is not a predicate—“Sein ist offenbar kein reales Prädikat” (Kant 1781). Rather, it merely is copular. It indicates something’s inclusion/exclusion in/from a particular domain of discourse (or universe of objects)—“Es ist bloß die Position eines Dinges oder gewisser Bestimmungen an sich selbst” (Kant 1781). Russell’s (1903) Lotzean distinction between being and existence is rejected on the grounds that it amounts to contradictions (e.g. “nonexistent things must exist as something and every thing is something”) and ill-formed propositions (e.g. “it is”). Moreover, conjugations of "to be" are more versatile than conjugations of "to exist" such that the former can substitute for the latter in virtually every case whereas the latter cannot substitute for the former in many cases. Thinkers like Parmenides denied the reality of time (and space) such that nothing real begins or ends because beginnings and endings are references to time. Beginnings and endings are illusory; they exist as illusions (i.e. unreal things). Mactaggart argued against the reality of time on the basis of the unreality of referents of time-orderings in terms of past, present, and future (i.e. A-series time-ordering). 

Whether or not teleology is included in pursuits of empirical knowledge (like scientific knowledge) depends on whether or not, for any particular explanandum, a teleological explanans is an inference to the best explanation. If two explanatia for the same explanandum are equally probable then, by virtue of lex parsimoniae, the less ontologically superfluous of the two is the better explanation. An example can help to illustrate how teleology has been excluded from scientific pursuits of knowledge. Lightning is more/less likely in places with higher/lower atmospheric convection than others yet, regardless of whether or not Zeus makes any lightning at all, it is most likely that there is lightning today if Zeus makes lightning whenever he is mad and if Zeus is mad today. Yet, it is implausible that "Zeus makes lightning whenever he is mad and he is mad today" truly explains that there is lightning today, because it is highly improbable that Zeus is mad today (regardless of how likely it would be that that there is lightning today if Zeus makes lightning whenever he is mad and if he is mad today). A no less plausible explanation for the lightning today (than an argumentum ad Jove) is that today's lightning was the making of unintelligent natural phenomena, which is plausible because it probably is a fact due to it being true a posteriori on many prior known occasions (whereas "Zeus makes lightning whenever he is mad and he is mad today" is not and has never been known a posteriori). Moreover, "unintelligent natural phenomena" makes for a better explanation than an argumentum ad Jove because, by virtue of Ockham's Razor, although Zeus might make lightning daily by increasing atmospheric convection daily, to include Zeus in an explanation (of how a natural phenomena caused the lightning today) is unnecessary to explain, sufficiently, today's lightning, which necessarily requires some mention of natural phenomena but does not necessarily require any mention of Zeus. It would be excessive to appeal to Zeus; argumentum ad Jove is not as ontologically parsimonious. More significantly, however, is that lightning is not proof or evidence of telos. [I've answered charitably, because to ask how it possibly can be true that "teleological explanations don't fit with modern science" is to ask how it cannot necessarily not be false that "teleological explanations don't fit with modern science." I'm assuming the inquirer is not dogmatically espoused to a particular metaphysic in which it is impossible for modern science to be ateleological.] 

Marx's labor theory of value really ought to be known as the "limiting-factor theory of value", because the theory is arguing that returns are proportional to the amount of a limiting-factor on returns. Marginal theory of value, on the other hand, objects to this by keeping open the possibility that chance also plays a role in returns. In other words, marginal theory of value suggests that returns are proportional to the amount of a limiting-factor on returns unless any arbitrary external factor makes it otherwise. The marginal theory of value makes fewer ontological commitments than the labor theory of value (i.e. than the limiting-factor theory of value) by not dogmatically assuming absolute monotonicity in the relationship between returns and a limiting-factor on return. 

Science proceeds by inference to the best explanation, which is an inference not exclusive to naturalism. If two explanatia for the same explanandum are equally probable then, by virtue of lex parsimoniae, the less ontologically superfluous of the two is the better explanation. An example can help to illustrate how science has come to infer naturalist explanations as better than theist explanations of phenomena. Lightning is more/less likely in places with higher/lower atmospheric convection than others yet, regardless of whether or not Zeus makes any lightning at all, it is most likely that there is lightning today if Zeus makes lightning whenever he is mad and if Zeus is mad today. Yet, it is implausible that "Zeus makes lightning whenever he is mad and he is mad today" truly explains that there is lightning today, because it is highly improbable that Zeus is mad today (regardless of how likely it would be that that there is lightning today if Zeus makes lightning whenever he is mad and if he is mad today). A no less plausible explanation for the lightning today (than an argumentum ad Jove) is that today's lightning was the making of unintelligent natural phenomena, which is plausible because it probably is a fact due to it being true a posteriori on many prior known occasions (whereas "Zeus makes lightning whenever he is mad and he is mad today" is not and has never been known a posteriori).

It would be excessive to appeal to Zeus; argumentum ad Jove is not as ontologically parsimonious. 

A traditional modal realist, which is a possibilist, would assume that all and only possible worlds are real worlds that exist and that an impossible world is an existing world that is not real. By "existing", I mean "being" in the Kantian sense of specifying particulars pertaining to particular domains of discourse (or universes of objects). Therein, modal realism does not preclude Meinong's Jungle, which is a domain of discourse in which impossible things exist, but before getting to that it is important to establish some foundation. Perhaps not ironically, your question is a modal question. "Do impossible worlds have to be incorporated in some way if one maintains he/she is a modal realist?" means to ask (as a modal realist), "Are impossible worlds possible worlds?" Answering "yes" seems to pose a contradiction, but the question is not specific enough. "Impossible real worlds are possible real worlds" is a contradiction and "impossible real worlds are possible unreal worlds" is not. That is, if "R" stands for "real world" such that ¬R denotes "unreal world" then ¬◇R∧◇R is a contradiction and ¬◇R∧◇¬R is a tautology. Much of modern ways of thinking about the metaphysics of modality can be traced back to Leibniz, and Leibniz associated impossibility with contradiction. For him, contradictions were impossible combinations such that, for any ontology, the only necessarily false statements were contradictory statements. To be more specific, necessitatem absolutum, in Leibnizian philosophy, entails truth in all possible worlds by virtue of principium contradictionis. “Les vérités nécessaires sont fondées sur le principe de contradiction” (Leibniz 1686). Likewise, impossibility entails falsity in every possible world, which justifies principium exclusi tertii sive medii inter duo contradictori. “In like manner as […] an assertion cannot be both true and false, so […] an assertion must be either true or false” (Mill 1843). Meinong's Jungle can be regarded as the singular unreal world, the only impossible world, and the sole world wherein there are unreal things like 4-vertice triangles. Whereas the actualism-possibilism debate is one about whether or not non-actual real things are possible, your question reduces to a question about whether or not impossible things are real. Note: Necessitatem absolutum ought not to be confused with necessitatem ex hypothesi. “Necessity […] consists either in the constant conjunction of like objects, or in the inference of the understating from one object to another” (Hume 1748). Necessitatem ex hypothesi is the truth/falsity of an apodosis as being contingently necessary for the truth/falsity of any hypothesis to which that apodosis belongs (irrespective of any protasis in particular). On the other hand, necessitatem absolutum may invoke a Parmenideanistic mundus intelligibilis (perhaps evocative of Platonic-Pythagorean εἶδοη). “Indépendamment de la preuve qu'on appelle apodictique [il y a donc] une certitude que nous avons souvent [...] qualifier de philosophique ou de rationelle, parce qu'elle résulte d'un jugement de la raison” (Cournot 1851). 

Something logically possible is something that is not logically impossible, and logical impossibility need not be defined circularly. Much of our modern ways of thinking about modal logic can be traced back to Leibnizian thought, and Leibniz associated impossibility with contradiction.

To be more specific, necessitatem absolutum, in Leibnizian philosophy, entails truth in all possible worlds by virtue of principium contradictionis. “Les vérités nécessaires sont fondées sur le principe de contradiction” (Leibniz 1686).
