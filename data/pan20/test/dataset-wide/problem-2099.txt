As is the case with requesting anything from an employer, you need to show your employer how it is to their benefit to give you what you are asking for. In this case that means that you need to demonstrate to your employer that getting two more weeks of work from you will benefit them less than letting you go immediately. The main benefit that the employer gets is not paying you for two weeks worth of work, but the fact that you have this job means that in general the employer views the work that you do as more valuable to the company than the money they pay you. So in order to convince them otherwise, it seems to me that you need to make it clear that the work you will be doing in your final two weeks will be of lower quality than usual, and thus is not worth the company's money. In other words, I don't think there is a way that you can get your employer to let you go immediately without burning bridges. 

I would not include the fact that you started programming at age 8 on your resume. Every item you list on your resume should be something that demonstrates your value as an employee. You list your previous jobs because it demonstrates that you are experienced, you list your certifications because it demonstrates that you are knowledgeable, you list your work organizing a charity drive at your previous job because it demonstrates that you can take initiative and be a leader, etc. With that in mind, you need to consider what you are trying to demonstrate by mentioning that you were 8 when you first learned to code, and also what prospective employers might perceive that as demonstrating. Presumably you see that fact as demonstrating that you have a lot of experience around programming and are good at learning things on your own. However, as Vietnhi Phuvan's answer shows, prospective employers might interpret that fact differently. Given the potential for potential employers to draw negative conclusions from that fact, I would not include the fact that you first learned to code at age 8, but rather find a different way to communicate the values you wish to demonstrate. 

The sixth form that I study at is joining (read being taken over by) a school's trust. They have decided to make the dress code significantly stricter. Currently, it is simply "business wear" but as of September they are making it more specific. In particular, they are requiring girls to wear blouses/shirts. This would be fine, except that any and all shirts I wear gape open along the line of buttons due to the lack of affordable shirts that suit my body shape. As a result, I would be extremely uncomfortable wearing a shirt, but I don't know how to bring this up with the new headteacher for next year, since she is generally unmoving on issues of dress code. Furthermore, she's not really the one in power, the school trust is, and I have no way to communicate with them that the dress code is unreasonable. I havent worn shirts for the past two years I've been at the school, and I've been complimented on how smart I look, so it's not an issue of me not meeting the original dress code either. Finally, this issue only affects me as the other two girls in the sixth form are leaving at the end of this academic year. How do I get my voice heard on the subject by somebody with the power to actually change the dress code? 

If the deadline was something you committed to without external pressure, the best way is probably to state you overcommitted, learned from it and will commit to less on your next deadline. If the deadline was established by your manager/boss (without taking your input into account) then you should raise a couple of alarms and point out most of the problem appears from overtime itself: "I work beyond normal hours quite regularly (often continue at home after dinner) " - as a client I wouldn't want a product/service that is done on "after-hours work quality". The fact you have to do overtime on your project is a sign of poor management/planning. "occasionally I finish working on something but don't "Send" or finish [...] because I get too tired" - typically, work when you are exhausted is exceptionally lacking in quality. When I did overtime (I am a consultant now, so it doesn't happen anymore), I used to have situations when I would work on a problem for an entire evening (4hrs+ after work), then give up, come back the next morning and solve the same problem in 10 minutes. 

The important parts: write it down while it's fresh, share it with involved people, store it (in such a way that it is indexable/findable easy). If there is big controversy in a decision (half the team wants it one way and half another way) then also write down a note on the controversy and what was decided. 

I'm a student, currently in my penultimate year of school/first year of sixth form. Earlier this year, I did work experience at a small game developers in London consisting of around 10 employees. I learnt a lot while I was there, however, the commute itself ended up costing me around Â£40 for the whole week, which is a lot when you have no source of income. In summer, I am returning to the company to test some games for them, and anything else that I can do. The problem is, I'm going for around 4-5 weeks, and I'll struggle to cover the costs of travel each day. It's not a paid internship, so I'm working for free. How do I bring up the subject of some kind of travel allowance with them without coming across badly? I just don't know how to approach the matter in a professional manner. 

I am currently doing a short internship for a month at a games developers that may result in a part-time job at the end. I am generally a fast worker, and often complete tasks way before people expect me to. The main problem I have is that I feel as though I am pestering the employees when I am asking for stuff to do, because I'm there every half-hour to an hour. At one point they ran out of stuff for me to do until the manager got back to give me something to work on. Now I am finding it hard to go and ask for more work, because I feel anxious that I am annoying them, even though I know they appreciate having the stuff done. I've spent time on learning things I want to as well, but whenever I do I feel guilty that I'm not working hard because I'm reading up on coding etc. How do I better approach people asking for work to do without feeling as awkward and how do I make it so that they have an expectation for me to finish things quickly, and not constantly be surprised when I'm already finished?
