The word for 'good' in Anatolian IE languages looks like this: Hittite: āššu Luwian: wāšu Palaic: wāšu 'goods' Lydian: wiśśi I have seen so many questionmarks regarding it's Indo-European reconstruction, which make me wonder whether those words are Indo-European or inherited by a pre-IE substrate. I know Greek has ἐύς and Illyrian ves- (in PN Vescleves), but those are languages from the "neighbourhood". My question is: Do we have other cognates within Indo-European or is my substrate hypothesis plausible? 

I am looking for an etymology on the Sanskrit word jāla 'web'. What is the origin of it? I am trying to find a parallel in other Indo-European languages but no luck so far. 

In cases of mutual intelligibility, it is the political entities that are responsible for the separation. Sometimes it is a matter of ethnic groups sharing a language or speaking two dialects of it (e.g. Serbian and Croatian, Bulgarian and Slavic Macedonian). In other cases the political entities do not matter, therefore the same language (by name) is spoken in different countries e.g. (Greek in Greece and Cyprus, Swahili in Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda). In linguistics you treat languages or dialects practically for what they are. However, that is not an easy task either. Two languages with 88% common vocabulary might be more intelligible because of shared phonology, than two dialects that share 93% of the vocabulary. So, what is a language and what is a dialect in that case? An example can be seen within Swedish, where certain west-Swedish dialects might share more with eastern- Norwegian dialects, than the south-most Swedish dialects. 

Usually the Turkish word kalem 'pen' is shown in etym. dictionaries to derive from Arabic qalam, which in turn derives from Greek κάλαμος. However, I noticed that Tocharian languages have the term kalām 'writing stylus' and I started thinking of the possibility that the Turkish word is through earlier Turkic-Tocharian contacts and not a later Turkish-Arabic contact. Has anyone considered the Tocharian kalām? 

I usually find scattered proto-Greek word reconstructions, but I never came across literature that focus on the reconstruction of that language. Do you know of any? 

I would go for the word for silence/calm, namely "SSSS". One can argue if it is a word or not, but that is another discussion. It is an utterance that is understood in most if not all languages. 

Yes, there have been suggestions of reducing υ, η, ει, οι etc to ι since that is the way they are pronounced today. Also ω to ο and αι to ε. Nevertheless, orthography in Greek is kinda "holy" and such suggestions are fiercely opposed. One of the arguments is the readability of ancient texts in the school (kids should recognize the words easier). For the consonants like β, δ, ζ there is not much to do as it is not a modern sound change anyway. The discussion has always been around the vowels. 

I got myself in a controversial discussion on word classification. To my knowledge words can be classified as a) inherited from a parent language, b) inherited substrate words, c) a result of innovation and d) loan words. For (a) we can consider the English word yard that comes from PIE *ghórdhos. For (b) the English bard is an inherited word from a Celtic substrate. For (c) the English word computer is an innovation. For (d) the English paradise is actually Iranic. Now from those 4 categories, which words can be actually considered English in a strict context? Obviously (a) and (c) can be definitely labelled English, (b) cannot but substrate words can occasionally be labelled with the inheritors name (e.g. we consider θάλασσα Greek word although it is a substrate word) and (d) cannot be labelled English. So my questions are the following: 

so that speaks too for a IE-root. Δᾶ seems to be the Doric version of γη/γᾶ. Now in order to be cautious, we should remember that Phrygian could (or should) have shared substratum with Greek, hence that wouldn't eliminate Kretschmer's theory. However, I don't see much support for it by others. 

What is the root of the Armenian word թագավոր (t'agavor) and what is it's relation to Greek ἀγαυός 'illustrious, nobble' and the Phrygian honorific epithet (AKENAN)-ΟΓΑϝΟΣ (ogawos)? Edit: I am reading that the root of t'agavor is a loan from Pahlavi tāgvar 'crown bearer'. Is that true? 

Babiniotis "Ετυμολογικό Λεξικό τής Νέας Ελληνικής Γλώσσας" is definetely a good source for personal and place names. The title refers to the modern Greek language, but includes etymologies on mythological names, ancient Greek names and placenames. Even biblical names are included. Here is a small sample: 

The first stem is ἁλι- derives from the word ἁλς meaning "sea" or generally the water close to the shore. Then you have πτοίᾱ which means "terror, fright, fear". 

I've been looking for a good explanation on the origin of the turkish word bakır, but I can't find much on it. Is it a loan or is it really a Turkic word for copper? 

Groups that could possibly contest such dates could be: a) "Old European" (call it whatever you like) in the sense of a group of languages being spoken in central and west Europe before the spread of Celtic and Germanic. b) The group that included the languages (eastern mediterranean substratum?) that were spoken by the first farmers of Anatolia who also crossed into Europe (esp. Crete and the Greek mainland). However, let me raise a caution as we have not enough material to reconstruct those yet, at least not in the same level as we have for Proto-Afrasian. All you got is the pre-Celtic substratum (100 words?) on one end and pre-Greek / Linear A / Eteo-Cypriot on the other end (good luck understanding those). Any dating would be hypothetical. Also, I would be very careful with whatever theories include Basque and Etruscan, their grouping and dating. 

I am wondering whether the Phrygian city "Ankara" (today capital of Turkey) meant really "anchor" in Phrygian? We know it means anchor in Greek, a sibling language to Phrygian with many isoglosses, but was the meaning exactly the same in Phrygian? I read in Pausanias "Description of Greece" (1.4.5) where he mentions the city of Ankara and says "ἄγκυρα δέ, ἣν ὁ Μίδας ἀνεῦρεν" (the anchor which Midas found). Considering that άγκυρα comes from the PIE root *ang-/*ank- "to bend, bow, curve, cavity", I am wondering whether the original Phrygian myth refers to the plataeu of Ankara which is like a basin and not an anchor. Why would Midas find randomly an anchor 900m above sea level? Not to mention that the anchor is not mentioned as being significant for something. Could it be that the Phrygians who told the story to Pausanias said ἄγκυρα without thinking that in Greek it explicitly means anchor? 

You've got a new ON dictionary here: $URL$ It has mainly later dialect words, but you will find more archaic ones too. Looks like it has just been released, so I guess by time more words from the period 800-1100 AD will show up. 

PIE *h2(e)r or *ar- 'thus, so' is the PIE root. Don't think though the Persian word derives from it. Phrygian has ἔρα which is a cognate to the Greek ἆρα. 

Tsakonian is considered a separate Hellenic language, deriving mostly from Doric Greek and not mutually intelligible by standard Greek speakers. Cappadocian and certain Pontic dialects are considered different languages sometimes, but this is debatable. Greek did change mainly in terms of phonology and (partially) grammar, but not that much in terms of core vocabulary. I think Blazec V. demonstrated this few years ago with a glottochronological example (I can get back to you with the title). Greek was indeed spoken in a great area, but was replaced (unlike Latin) by other languages such as Arabic, which was closer to the native tongue of the former Greek speakers in those areas. 

Turkish has many genderless names e.g Deniz "sea", Devrim "revolution", Yuksel "raise", Özgur "free", Ilhan "ruler", Ismet "ethical, honest", Fikret "idea, opinion", Ömür "lifetime". I am sure there are more, but I am not aware of those. Some Turkish member can provide more examples. I guess the Turkic names are the ones that are usually genderless, unless they refer to something that is specifically female or male e.g Asena "she wolf". 

There is a library called Unidecode that translates any unicode (that includes IPA) to ascii. It is available in python and .net as far as I know. From what I see, you are using php in that site. I have not tried it, but there is a PHP-version of it here: $URL$ 

Unlike most Indo-European languages Turkish for example groups some words for taste under one word e.g. acı. Are there other languages lacking words for example sour, bitter, sweet, salty, hot/sharp etc? Are there languages that lack taste terminology or where taste is restricted to "tasty" / "not tasty"? 

Most probably her name derives from PIE *dhǵhōm-. Kretschmer suggests that δᾶ (Δαματήρ) is a pre-Greek version of γη/γᾶ, but I tend to believe Heubeck's (1961) and others suggestion of an Indo-European root for 'earth'. Phrygian has 

Of course, it's purpose is not to cover all Greek toponymy as that would require a gigantic volume. It is simply a huge etymological dictionary including place and personal names. For toponyms and their etymology there is a dedicated book which basically covers mainly the modern names. However, since so many places are called by their ancient name it might be of your interest. In some places he explains that place name A is of Slavic origin and then tells you what the ancient name was. It is a huge volume and a bit pricey. You can have a look here: Νεοελληνκά Οικωνύμια (Τοπωνύμια) and for a sample here There is also this site where under the "Other" tab there is an index of Pre-Greek place names. Of course Pre-Greek means no etymology. A collection of papers dedicated to personal names: Greek Personal Names: Their Value as Evidence Possibly one of the best resources on Greek dialectology has a searchable database of personal names as well: ΘΕΤΙΜΑ 

Most Turkic languages use the Arabic words for greeting, namely salam/selam/merhaba etc. The exceptions are Tatar isänmesez and Uighur yakhshimusiz, the origin of which I do not know. Are they Turkic? What did Turkic people say to greet each other before those Arabic words entered their vocabulary? 

If you look for ancient languages or early stages of certain groups, you could try this: $URL$ but you might need to do some work too. It has an experimental cognate research tool. 

I will first answer to the title of the question, namely "What is the substrate of Romanian language". Romanian could have several substrate layers. The most frequent one is the Dacian layer, which was the language spoken in the region of Romania prior to the adoption of Latin. Dacian was an Indo-European language for which we have very limited material (place names, ethnonyms, plant names and various words attested by ancient authors). Dacian is considered to be related to Thracian and is sometimes bundled for convinience under a group called Thraco-Dacian. Our account for claiming a relationship between Dacian and Thracian is Strabo (7.3) who writes: "the Dacians speak the same language as the Getae". Earlier in the same chapter he writes: "The Greeks indeed considered the Getæ to be Thracians". So, Getæ = Thracians and then Dacian language = Getæ language, makes Dacian = some dialect of Thracian (?) according to the Greeks. That is the indication, but we cannot take it for granted, especially if we examine the Dacian toponymy. Now, if we turn to the substrate layer of Romanian, that is to say non-Latin words, that predate the latin adoption and that are not loans (Greek) nor an adstrate (Slavic, Greek), then we end up to what we suppose to be Dacian. There is a long list of such words and suprisingly many of them have Albanian cognates e.g. Rom abur ~ Alb. avull 'stream, vapour', Rom. burtă ~ Alb. bark 'belly', Rom. cetină Ãlb. cetinë 'pine tree', Rom. iască ~ Alb. eshkë 'fungus', Rom. măgură ~ Alb. gamule 'heap, mound', Rom. cătun ~ Alb. katund 'village', Rom. mal 'shore, bank' ~ Alb. mal 'mountain', Rom. mînz ~ Alb. mëz 'foal', Rom. murg 'brown' ~ Alb. murg 'black', Rom. negură ~ Alb. njegull 'fog, mist', Rom. pîrîu ~ Alb. përrua 'brook, riverbed', Rom. rață ~ Alb. rose 'duck', Rom. strungă ~ Alb. shtrungë 'enclosure for milking', Rom. tină ~ Alb. tinë 'slime, mid', Rom. vatră ~ Alb. vatër 'hearth', Rom. zgău ~ Alb. zgurdhe 'rectum'. Examples like the above have lead some to assume that Albanian and Dacian share pre-history and that Albanian could be a result of a east-Balkanic migration towards Illyricum (Orel V., 2000). Except from Dacian, there are traces of Old European, Mediterranian and Celtic words. The OE and Mediterranian words can be somekind of a Pre-Indo-European substrate, but the Celtic words are either a post Dacian layer or words that were brought by Romanized Celts at the same time as Latin. As for Vlachs (mentioned in the body of the question) who speak Aromanian, the question is too broad. Their homeland is not pin-poined and they could be simply romanized wandering shepherds of different ethnic groups and languages.

Are there any examples of language shift, where population A changes language because of contacts with population B? I am not looking about examples where population A was conquered or colonized by B. I am looking for examples where population A had an interest in changing to the language of population B, because of extensive contacts, social status etc.
