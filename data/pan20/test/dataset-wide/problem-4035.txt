There are interesting examples where the duality you're trying to bake in does not hold. In particular, the 3+1 dimensional (pseudo-)TQFTs coming from Seiberg-Witten theory in 4 dimensions do not have such duality maps. This is possible since the TQFT is only defined for a subset of the 4-d cobordism, for instance cobordisms where both the input and the output are connected 3-manifolds. (The actual TQFT allows one of the two sides to be disconnected, depending on which flavor you look at.) Presumably this is related to some strangeness from the physics point of view. 

If the orginal link $U_1 \cup U_2$ was hyperbolic, the answer is yes. For large enough $n$, $S^3 \setminus K(n)$ will also be hyperbolic, and will approach $S^3 \setminus (U_1 \cup U_2)$ in the Gromov-Hausdorff topology; so the sequence $K(n)$ determines the complement of $U_1 \cup U_2$. The complement doesn't determine the link in general (unlike for knots), but we also have the marking of the component $U_1$ by its meridian, which I believe is enough. The answer in general is also almost certainly yes, but I haven't thought through all the cases. Note that this operation has a simple geometric description: arrange $U_1 \cup U_2$ so that $U_2$ sits as a flat unknot in a plane. Then to get $K(n)$, remove $U_2$ and twist the bundle of strands that passed through $U_2$ by $n$ full twists. (This is all much easier than Lackenby's result mentioned above.) 

The points of Spec $V$ live n a somewhat complicated completion of the space of knots (not formal linear combinations), but I think it's illuminating to think about the case of braids and their "Vassiliev" invariants. In that context the global points of Vassiliev invariants are elements of the completion of the braid group with respect to the lower central series. The braid group embeds in this completion, and so Vassiliev invariants do separate braids. (This is not hard.) By the way, the knot invariants $I$ also form a bi-algebra, where the coproduct is dual to connect sum of knots, although that coproduct plays no role for this question. 

(Making this an answer, since it will be a little long, even though it doesn't actually answer the question.) One thing to be aware of is that there are multiple ways to talk about this same TQFT. In particular, Reshetikhin and Touraev took a much more combinatorial point of view in defining the 3-manifold invariants. There's an entirely different way of getting at the vector space associated to a surface $\Sigma$ from the combinatorial point of view. You can take a handlebody $H$ with boundary $\Sigma$, pick a trivalent graph spine $\Gamma$ for $H$, and look at the vector space spanned by admissible colorings on $\Gamma$. You then have to work a little bit to see that different choices of $H$ and $\Gamma$ give canonically isomorphic vector spaces. This is quite different from the description in terms of line bundles, as you described. It's not obvious that the two descriptions are isomorphic, and I'm not sure where to point you to get a proof that they are isomorphic. (Of course Witten gives a beautiful physics argument for isomorphism.) 

For deciding whether a language is "circular", you can just take the normalized DFA for the language (where the states correspond to sets of possible different completions). In that normalized DFA, a language is circular iff the only accept state is the start state, pretty much by definition. I don't know what you want by a characterization. A language L has this property iff it is M* for some other language M, but that's not useful.. 

I permuted the entries slightly, but they're labelled along the sides. The dotted paths are there to help in the counting: the non-allowed configurations would form a closed loop. 

(Answering Lukasz's question from the comments) If you consider the non-commutative power series for a language, the regular languages are characterized by having rational power series constructable with coefficients in $\mathbb{N}$. This is cited as Theorems 2.4 and 2.5 of Koutschan, "Regular languages and their generating functions: The inverse problem", Theoretical Computer Science 391(1-2), pp. 65-74. 2008 who is quoting the obviously relevant book Salomaa, Sittola, Bauer, and Gries, Automata-Theoretic Aspects of Formal Power Series, Springer-Verlag, 1978. (However, I haven't yet read this last reference.) 

Laver tables of order $n$ provide a potential answer (although it's not proven to be independent of ZFC, and may not be independent of ZFC). The Laver table of order $n$ is the $2^n \times 2^n$ table of an operation $\star$ defined recursively by $$ p \star 1 = p+1 \bmod {2^n}\\ p \star (q \star r) = (p \star q) \star (p \star r). $$ They arise naturally in the study of (self) left-distributive systems (systems satisfying the second axiom above). The first row of this table ($1 \star p$) is always periodic with some period $m$ dividing $2^n$. Let $p(n)$ be this periodicity. Assuming an extremely large cardinal, Laver showed that $p(n)$ increases without bound as $n$ increases. (The consistency of this large cardinal axiom, the existence of a self-embedded cardinal, is apparently in doubt.) Under this same large cardinal hypothesis, Dougherty showed, for instance, that the first $n$ for which $p(n)>m$ grows faster than any primitive recursive function of $m$. I'm not sure what the current state of belief is on whether this statement is independent of ZFC. There were various other statements first proved by Laver using this large cardinal hypothesis that were later proved by Dehornoy; for instance, there is an algorithm to decide the word problem in a free left-distributive algebra. I could have sworn there was a statement in this theory that was known to be independent of ZFC, but I couldn't find it when I looked. I'm not a logician. Apologies if I'm misstating any results.

If there are only finitely many values for the $a_i$, then I believe the answer to both questions is affirmative for somewhat silly reasons. If you have any rational power series $f(x)$ with only finitely many different coefficients, then I believe the power series $f_c(x)$ with a coefficient of 1 when $f(x)$ has $c$ (and 0 otherwise) is also rational. (Restivo and Reutenauer, "On cancellation properties of languages which are supports of rational power series", cite Sontag, "On some questions of rationality and decidability" for this fact. I couldn't find the precise statement, but the techniques are plausibly related.) Then you can easily rearrange the coefficients as in Question 1. (This would also work for a slightly weaker version of Question 2 that seems likely to be relevant for you: instead of power series in $x$, work in non-commutative power series in the alphabet of $L$ and do the rearranging there. For this, you need to know that $\sum p^{a_i} w$ is rational, but it sounds like you do.) (The theorems above can be made easier by assuming that the power series like $\sum p^{a_i} x^i$ are the weighted generating series of a regular language with positive weights, which again sounds like the relevant case; then you can just use the usual NDFA -> DFA reduction.) However, your $a_i$ are not bounded, it sounds like. The linear recurrence on the coefficients is going to give strong constraints on the $a_i$, but I don't yet see how to finish this to a proof. 

More useful than embedding it in some higher-dimensional space will be to give it as a manifold with identifications, I think. Topologically, $SO(3)/\!\sim$ is the same space as what you get by taking an octahedron and gluing the opposite faces with a $1/3$ turn. This is related to the 24-cell, one of the 6 different regular 4-dimensional polytopes (analogues of Platonic solids in 4 dimensions), using the fact that $SO(3)$ is topologically $RP^3$, the quotient of the 3-sphere $S^3$ by the antipodal map. The space of course comes with a natural metric and measure (both inherited from the one on $SO(3)$. You can see this metric/measure on the octahedron by embedding it as a regular octahedron of an appropriate size subset of $SO(3)$. You can work out the size by looking at the volume: 12 of these octahedra tile $SO(3)$, or 24 tile the double-cover $S^3$. Alternatively, each corner of the octahedron in $SO(3)$ is a rotation by $\pi/4$ around one of the faces of the cube, and the center of each face of the octahedron is a rotation by $\pi/3$ around one of the vertices of the cube. 

(B) does not hold for topological graphs. Let $X$ be the 1-skeleton of a tetrahedron, and let $S$ be a cycle of 4 edges. Then $X \setminus S$ is not connected. 

There are several references that consider the relation between extremal length and hyperbolic length. Usually they consider closed surfaces, but you can put yourself in that situation by doubling along the boundary. Here are some relevant papers: Matsuzaki, Katsuhiko. Bounded and integrable quadratic differentials: hyperbolic and extremal lengths on Riemann surfaces. Geometric complex analysis (Hayama, 1995), 443–450, World Sci. Publ., River Edge, NJ, 1996. $URL$ Maskit, Bernard. Comparison of hyperbolic and extremal lengths. Ann. Acad. Sci. Fenn. Ser. A I Math. 10 (1985), 381–386. Rafi, Kasra. Thick-thin decomposition for quadratic differentials. Math. Res. Lett. 14 (2007), no. 2, 333–341. $URL$ I think the Maskit paper might be most relevant. 

There are lots of ways to do this; without more constraints (or indication of what is desired), it's hard to pick a best one. But here's one. We'll exploit the fact that for any two triangles, there is a unique affine linear map that takes one to the other (with vertices in a specified order); if the two triangles have the same area, this will be area-preserving. Start by chopping up $C$ into triangles $T_1,\dots,T_k$ by drawing lines connecting the vertices to the center. Now take $R$ to be a square with the same area as $C$. Divide up the boundary of $R$ into $k$ intervals $I_1,\dots,I_k$ whose lengths are proportional to the area of the $T_i$. (Some of the intervals may make a turn at the corner.) Divide the square into regions $S_i$ by connecting the ends of $I_i$ to the center of the square. Most of the $S_i$ will be triangles, except for the four at the corners, which are quadrilaterals. Now, the area of $S_i$ is equal to the area of $T_i$, since the area of $S_i$ is proportional to the length of its base (as all $S_i$ have the same height), which is proportional to the area of $T_i$. Now just map $T_i$ to $S_i$ in an area preserving way. For the $S_i$ that are not at the corners, just take the affine linear map from above. For the $S_i$ that do go around the corner, cut both $S_i$ and $T_i$ into two triangles in the same proportion of area, and map the corresponding triangles to each other. 

Torsten's answer was good, but there are also more elementary answers. Here's one, which is essentially a big transversality argument, followed by a mild de-singularization. Let me consider $M$ to be a triangulated 4-manifold, and represent a class in $H_2(M)$ as a sum of 2-faces of the triangulation. For each 2-face appearing with multiplicity $n$ in the sum, take $n$ copies of the face, pushed off of each other slightly and meeting only at the edges. Now, along each edge (1-face) of the triangulation, since we started with a 2-cycle the total number of triangles meeting there is $0$. (This is a signed count if we are working in $H_2(M; \mathbb{Z})$, and means that there are an even number if we are in $H_2(M; \mathbb{Z}/2)$.) Along each edge, pair up the incident triangles in an arbitrary way that's compatible with the orientations, and resolve the intersections along the interior of the edge according to that pairing. (A neighborhood of the edge looks like $D^3 \times I$; the incident triangles are coming in from fixed directions, i.e., at fixed points in $S^2 \times I$; so given any pairing of the points on $S^2$, we can just join them up and avoid the edge altogether. It's easier to think about what happens in a 3-manifold, where it's very similar, you just have to be more picky about how you pair the incident triangles.) After the last step, we have a surface $S$ with codimension-2 singularities at points in $M$. For each such singularity, consider a small ball $B$ in $M$ and consider $S \cap \partial B$. This is a link $L$ in a 3-manifold (oriented or not, depending on which homology we look at). Replace $S \cap B$ with a Seifert surface for $L$, and we're done. (You could also use any surface with boundary $L$ inside the 4-ball $B$ instead of the Seifert surface, of course. Frequently you can get lower genus that way.) 

The $\text{co-NP}$ certificate is currently conditional on the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis, and is based on finding representations of the knot group:
