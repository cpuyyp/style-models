I'm not sure what the question is here: A dualist or an idealist may have objections to the materialist account; but does this mean too he has to explain why materialists still remain materialists? I'm not sure that this is what you are intending to ask, given that: 

It's an abstraction of something sensed ie intuited; thus an intellectual idea; like that of the mathematically perfect circle from a physically imperfect circle - like the rim of a wheel. 

Here he has the gods differing amongst themselves; and he offers in support of this statement the following: 

I find it quite difficult to make sense of your second paragraph; ie it's actual argument - you say: 

Possibly; Western thought rightly or wrongly is tied to Western technology; the rise of which has 'levelled' the world according to Hannah Arendt; and one can point to the lack of this tie as one reason for it not to be 'respected'. There are issues of course to do wth access to primary and secondary literature - he barrier of language; plus the alleigance one has to the coodinates of ones own native tradition. 

Facts of observation aren't always facts of observation: I mean by this, that most facts a practising scientist like a Einstein would have worked wouldn't have been observations he personally made; he must, then have an authoritative source of facts he can rely on. Can one say that Newtonian mechanics, and classical electromagnetism have been borne out by experiment; if so, then isn't this - a theory buttressed by facts - a fact too? 

From 2, we can derive the doctrine of Idealism, all is mind; or that of physicalism, that all is matter. From 1, we derive Spinozas system. question: a. Is this a correct summary of Descartes position and how does he himself solve it? b. Was Descarte the first to present this position, or was it well known in Medeival Theology? 

As Rex Kerr mentions Chalmers tends be where one should go to explore this question. Qualia - actual experiential datum is where at least one of the core difficulties within the hard problem; it isn't I think essential; after all one can close ones eyes and one is still here. Qualia is the difference between the colour red that you can see (ie experience) and the wavelength of the colour red, that we theoretically know it to be. Another way of explaining this is the difference between a photograph of Schrodingers cat and his actual cat - two very different things. Metaphyics here is actually very important; but is not usually seen to be. For example, within the philosophical system called Naturalism; then consciousness must be an emergent property; since there is no other place for it to come from - there is no other; we say emergent because there is no actual theory of it as such, and because its 'expected' to come from the study of large complex systems. If consciousness or qualia is not an emergent property, then this is important because it breaks the philosophical theory of Naturalism; something else will have to take its place. Its interesting to point out here, that Democritus, one of the founders of Naturalism, in the form usually called Milesian Materialism, did think that experience (its usually called psyche or, in translation, as soul) was natural, and not only that it was composed of atoms. Its also useful to point out that the distinction between qualia and consciousness is not that easy to separate; one would have to take all qualia into account, ie from natality; when the psyche is 'born'; it's natural to assume that qualia is essential to consciousness - to deprive a baby from actual experience, ie put it in a sensory deprivation tank would severely harm her, if not kill her. In this context, the theory of consciousness from a Buddhist perspective is important (I'm not terribly au fait with it); and this is that consciousness has no svabhava, that is not self-existent; it is a stream - one might say a stream of consciousness. 

Before going into demonstrating how this is in fact possible (one might then accept its possibility and intelligibility without then proceeding to its neccessity). I'm not sure Feynman for all his deserved fame as a physicist should be taken as an authority on the history of physics, never mind that of philosophy or the interaction of the two; he did once point out I recall reading somewhere in one of his popular accounts that atomism was the pre-eminent idea of modern physics having not realising its actual origins in antiquity, and also how both argument and observation were marshalled to make the case. The passage quoted by him rather looks like using philosophy as a straw-man - after all he mentions no-one by name, but a generic armchair philosopher; it's rather like Galileos Dialogue on two world systems where he pits two philosophers against each other, and the philosopher he chooses to present the weaker argument he calls simplicio ie simple-minded (in Italian semplice). 

Ayn Rand philosophical hero is Aristotle, and her work bears comparison with his work on Ethics that he wrote for his son, and is named after him - Nicomachean Ethics, its commonly called virtue ethics. Aristotle explains that virtue is to keep to centre and away from extremes. For example the virtue of courage is the midpoint of the two extremes of cowardice and recklessness. To judge by her book, the virtues of selfishness, and despite its name Rand also aims for that centre - she regards actual selfishness as well as actual selflessness as extremes. Rand fled communist Russia and her work reflected the enormous upheaval that Russian society then went through, its clear that she belonged to a class that benefited from then social structure - she was the daughter of a successful pharmacist & businessman. After the outbreak of the revolution their property was confiscated. As a Russian with a visceral hatred for the Revolution, her work found a ready audience given the Cold War geopolitics. Both Socialism and Communism developed as a force against the ravages of 19C Capitalism. The first advocating a reformist agenda, and the second a revolutionary one. In this video, Rand explains she advocates neither collectivism for employers nor for employees. She advocates laissez-faire. How this can work in practise without reverting to collectivism is left unexplained. Collectivism for the employees (the vast majority in any economy), roughly speaking, is aligned with Socialism; Collectivism for employers, again roughly speaking, could be termed an Oligarchy, where the interests of the powerful propertied few command the heights of the economy. However, one ought to note, to complicate this very simple picture that Britain until the 80s had an economy that was managed by a compact between Industry, Government & Labour; a similar compact in Japan powered its economy from post-war disaster to the second strongest economy globally until just recently. Interestingly enough, a recent study by Princeton University shows that the USA is an oligarchy. One might suppose a similar effect is probable in all the major Western economies, and when this ties in with the explicitly named Autocratic Capitalism of the Russian Federation, and the State Capitalism of China; it appears that Capital is best served, if one is to go by empirical evidence, not democracies but oligarchies of one form or another. So it appears that the evidence is against Rand. Strangely enough, in her last few years her heavy smoking habits caught up with her, and she developed lung-cancer; and she recieved Social Security & Medicare for treatment (though the facts and interpretation of the situation have been disputed). Treatment and help, had she her own way, would not have been there. 

This 'awareness of oneself as a subject' is the what Hegel mentions as 'Essence – which is Being coming into mediation with itself through the negativity of itself – is self-relatedness, only in so far as it is relation to an Other' But Concepts for Kant is simply that which makes Intuitions intelligible to the Understanding. This involves the above idea as the quotation from the SEP notes, but is separate from it. 

Spinozas theology is sometimes represented by the phrase 'God or Nature'; however he specifically notes that only two attributes, of an infinity of attributes of God, are cogtnisible to us - mind and extension; extension being that of Nature in its outward sense, and mind, being Nature in its inward sense - human nature. But doesn't this description show that Nature is in God, rather than Nature is God? 

Consider the puzzle of the 'chicken and egg' - what came first, has a resolution given our knowledge of genetics. The chicken must develop true from the egg; thus it is in the egg or 'seed' that a 'defect' or error in the genetic code can occur; now consider that Aristotles says: 

Square circles aren't possible in Euclidean Geometry - so they are logically inconsistent there; but they are possible in other geometries: Equip the plane with the the L1 norm; and draw the circle; and then stand back and look at it - it's a square circle. Paradoxes come in many forms - zen koans, physical singularities, logical absurdities, reductios and so on. Sometimes they say: this far, and no further; at other times they are pregnant with thought. Here is another example: division by zero; not 0/5, which is well defined within the formal context of arithmetic; but 0/0, which is not - it's undefined, it could be any number - but this turns out to be unuseful and unusable. But 0/0, when considered as dx/dy, is not - it's fruitful, being the formal concept of the calculus; but why do I say this - after all it's not how historically calculus was invented. Mathematicians like closure: where all operations and moves are well defined; a point of exception, instead is a challenge; and often proves to be the site of a new idea. Thus 0/0, can be considered a site of exception, which when pushed through generates a new site, of a different order - not the arithmetic, but the analytic; this may, on the face of it, seem strange, or bizarre - but consider another site of exception, by way of comparison: the square root of -1, whose proper answer is i, the imaginary - it generates geometry: the argand diagram; it's very name signals the differance of degree that pushing past this site has provoked. Proper points of exceptions in mathematics (as opposed to mere or illusionary such points), may be considered as sites, where several concepts fuse, in an alchemical act of the mathematical imagination, and reveal a hitherto hidden dimension of depth in the being that is mathematics. 

There's a tradition in Philosophy that uses mathematics to characterise physical ontology; starting with the Pythagoreans and continuing with Platos Timaeus; in the contemporary modern world, Physics - what was once Natural Philosophy - describes an aspect of the world - it's physical ontology; and it most definitely uses mathematics - though it's not reducible to it. Consider too the first statement in Wittgensteins Tractatus, which relies on philosophical thinking on propositions (facts). 

God being perfect, and creation imperfect, creation can only occur where he is not; it is in the space of his absence that creation is made possible; and being less than perfect contains suffering/evil. So rather than man withdrawing from God; it is God who withdraws so that man can be. This theodice of Simone Weils is the inversion of the (Plotinist) emanationist cosmologies; it is also the same: absence being the lack of presence; presence being the lack of absence. quotes from Weils Gravity & Grace. 

The plainest vanilla variety of propositional modal logic introduces two operators <> which is possibility, and [] which is neccessity. The axioms are: 

I think so; so long as your second 'imagining' is interpreted as abstraction; which of course is a process of imagination. 

The philosophical concept you're looking for is foundationalism; it hasn't always been neccessary - after all arithmetic was done and number theory pursued for two Millenia before a foundational movement took hold. There are other foundations of mathematics; one that is growing in importance is based on category theory. Philosophy has pretty much maintained an interest in Language from its beginnings; this being how we think things through; for example Aristotle begins his analysis of logic by looking how we concieve things in language. But that there is more to mathematics than set theory, and there is more to philosophy than the philosophy of language - interesting though they are. A quote from The Republic (Book VI) might prove useful here: 

historical context This essentially, in philosophical terms, broadly alludes to the paradoxes of Zeno which originally aimed at the defending the notion of Parmenidian Monism; it lead on to the development of Atomism. In mathematics it was harnessed in defence of the Calculus after the criticisms of Berkeley; the idea of a limit was developed by Cauchy - though the key ideas was already in Leibniz. To place it in the modern context, the question admits of two answers; the geometrical and analytical with an interlude. analytical The analytical answer is the notion of a limit. This is the construction of new ideal points. For example the sequence 1,1/2,1/4,1/8... are all rational fractions that are indexed by the natural numbers; for any finite number n we have the number 1/2^n; hence we always find that it is non-zero; the limit of this sequence is not found in any of these fractions; it lies outside; that is it is the number that is indexed not by any finite n; To be clear here, these numbers that we are using to index the fractions are not numbers in the usual sense since we do not care that we can add, subtract or multiply them; we care only for their ordering properties; there is a class of numbers that do exactly this; the ordinals; so to repeat - for the nth ordinal we have the rational fraction 1/2^n; now the finite ordinal have a limit - called the first infinite ordinal omega; so we can ask what is the fraction indexed by 1/2^(omega); the only good answer here is zero; this is a new ideal point, even though it looks like one that is already kicking about; we say this because if we do what we have just done for any arbitrary sequence of rationals we get many more, in fact uncountably many more fractions that do not lie within the rationals. It is this schema that is used construct the modern notion of the Reals from the Rationals. interlude This relies on the notion of an infinitesimal - which is nonzero & yet smaller than any fraction. It is either constructed formally by the tools of mathematical logic; or posited axiomatically; all this relies on work by Robinson. geometrical This brings us back to the original notions of calculus which wasn't a purely analytical manouver; but a geometrical one; one is after all interested in geometrical notions like the tangent to a curve; which links to the physical notions of motion; velocity as a tangent, say; Here one finds the notions of a non-zero, infinitesimal rod can be made rigorous (using Topos theory); so a curve is simply just made up of these rods lined up end-to-end; and to find the tangent at a point; one simply picks the unique rod at that point. It relies on work by Lawvere & Kock amongst others. More can be said: An alternative axiomatic construction relies on the theory of dual numbers; these are numbers that square to zero; but the theory can only be made sense of if we move from classical logic to intuitionistic logic - the logic where the law of the excluded middle no longer holds; it is through this logic that it is the bridge to Topos Theory. Its also worth noting that Deleuze wrote in Difference & Repetition:
