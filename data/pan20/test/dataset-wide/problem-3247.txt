No where in any of those definitions of Historian is the time-frame of History itself defined. Major events in world history, say World War II, will have many historians dissecting and writing. The first histories of that event were published in the early 1950's. Not even a decade after. There are already scholarly papers written about, and a few books as well, the so-called Arab Spring. Most agree that primarily occurred in 2011. A mere blip in time. The fact is that as soon as an event happens, anywhere, it is immediately in the past. Depending on the import of that event, historians may begin to dissect its effect on the larger world. 

I was working on wording a food question for Pitcairn islanders (settlers from the Bounty mutiny) when I happened across this article. It suggests that the 'commonly known' theories of the Easter Islanders denuding their island and starving themselves out of existence is false. Supposedly they brought rats with them who ate the trees causing an ecological crisis, however they also state that the surviving Islanders that Cook discovered weren't starving at all. Can anyone elaborate on the conditions of the Easter Islanders as far as food is concerned? 

If you blow up the photo and look carefully, the Squadron name is the USAF Bee Liners, which is the name of the 21st Air Lift Squadron. I actually believe this is a Douglas C-54 Skymaster. You can see plane 7233-A in this photo 

However the paragraph is not cited, so whether it is true or not remains to be seen. There are many photos in the site of saloons. Perhaps studying some you might be able to make out price lists above the bars. I would agree, however, with Tyler Durden's assessment. It stands to reason that a so-called "shot" would have been priced somewhere between 10 and 25 cents, and a bottle (of rotgut) would have been $1 or so. That would be extremely watered down though. A bottle of the "good stuff" would have been correspondingly higher. 

If your enemy has notice of your approach and are on your side of the river, they can cross the river first, and then use verse 4 against you. If your enemy is on the far side of the river, and they have notice of your approach, they can deny your attack. If they don't have time to cross, they can use the river as a defense against encirclement (verse 3). These three verses are generally thought to be supportive of one another. 

They appear to be DFS (Deutsche Forschungsanstalt f√ºr Segelflug) 230 Assault Gliders, with the wings removed. There is a great page here, with some photos, and a page for a kit form toy model here. Here is one of the better photos: 

Understand that the gladiators received training, by soldiers, other gladiators, etc, and this took time. Time is money, in that all the while the gladiators were being trained they were being housed and fed, and a gladiator, even if slave, could not "work the field" or anything else a slave might do, because their lives were taken up by the training needed to allow them to "fake combat" realistically. I believe that gladiators were the WWE Entertainment wrestlers of their day. While their matches inside the amphitheaters were scripted to an extent, they still needed to be able to make the crowd believe the combat, and two men (and women, believe it or not) swinging implements of destruction are going to cause wounds, large and small. 

If the river is a barrier, you can be hemmed in against it. If your enemy is the one hemmed in, they also have a defense on at least one side, preventing you from surrounding them. 

It is generally known as an Archaeological North Arrow. It serves several purposes all at once. The archaeologist will put this down in view of the find, oriented to true North. The scale is usually marked in centimeters, so there is a valid way of determining the size or scale of what is being photographed (many people might use something like a dollar bill in a crunch). The white portions can be written on with a marker to give information (not needed in this case because of the board) and the North arrow will be printed in some defined color quality, so that contrast can be determined (so that the background lighting can be qualitatively determined (which will help in determining things like shadows and lighting/coloration)). If it is a well known and already documented dig, the reference board will have location identifiers based on the grid-layout of the site. If it is a brand new find, the archaeologist might put the GPS coordinates on the board, or on the North Arrow directly, again, in order to help identify the exact location of the find. As it happens, this photo appears to be from the EISP, or Easter Island Statue Project. If you go to the EISP.org site and look in Phase 1 Season 2, Photo 9 of 12 shows their use of the same pair of North Arrow and a Letter Board. In Tyler Durden's answer he mentions a Scale Stick. In Phase 1 Season 3, Photo 10 of 12 as well as Photo 12 of 12, you'll see a Scale Stick being used. I haven't linked the photo's, because of potential copyright issues as well as I can't quite figure out how to do it with these photos. Although I haven't found your specific photo yet, it's probably in one of the books. 

Yes, they did. Not all, but a very many, especially the more veteran soldiers. I don't have time to get sources together, but will when I do. Reasons were varied. Some believed that being close to over-pressure events (artillery, etc) could cause a head injury with the large helmet being force up and the tough leather strap breaking the neck. This was supported by more than one army regiment actually giving written orders to their men to not buckle up. 

Dong Ap Bia is a mountain in Vietnam. Since the lighter has the dates (19)65-66, it was probably used (and engraved) by a soldier stationed in support of the Montagnards who lived on and around the area. In that area of Vietnam there were no straight, flat roads, and in fact no roads at all. So every where a soldier had to go they did it up and down (the mountains.)
