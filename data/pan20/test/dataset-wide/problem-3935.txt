This sounds bizarre, but my computations suggest that 21 might be a possibility.. I checked the tournaments on up to 9 vertices (10 vertices is under way) and got the following results: 

22 vertices, there are 80 of them. Jensen and Royle, Small graphs with chromatic number 5 : a computer search Journal of Graph Theory, 1995. 

Yes, I believe that it will have simple spectrum for d >= 3 and it feels like something that should have been proved, though I can't actually find it. There is a loose association between automorphisms of a graph and multiple eigenvalues, and as most regular graphs have trivial automorphism group we lose this source of multiple eigenvalues. There are no other (frequently occurring) "reasons" for a graph to have multiple eigenvalues and so in general they won't be there. ADDED: Here are some exact numbers for connected (pairwise nonisomorphic) cubic graph: disconnected graphs vanish numerically and so we can ignore them. 10 vertices - 19 graphs - 6 with no repeated eigs = 31% simple 12 vertices - 85 graphs - 18 with no repeated eigs = 21% simple 14 vertices - 509 graphs - 316 with no repeated eigs = 62% simple 16 vertices - 4060 graphs - 2181 with no repeated eigs = 54% simple 18 vertices - 41301 graphs - 26446 with no repeated eigs = 64% simple (Actually this is growing more slowly than I expected... ) 

then I think that they each have exactly 11 4-blobs and 4 6-blobs (using "blob" rather than overloading the word cycle) but one has 8 vertices and 12 edges and the other has 9 vertices and 13 edges. Here's a list of the blobs for the first graph (preceded by the size) 

Perhaps I am missing something, but it seems to me that we can do the hypercube calculations exactly. In the hypercube of valency $m$, pick an arbitrary vertex. Then there are ${m}\choose{1}$ vertices at distance 1, ${m}\choose{2}$ at distance 2, etc and so the total of the distances squared is $$ \sum_{i=1}^{i=m} {m \choose i} i^2 = 2^{m-2} m(m+1) $$ The average distance squared is then this value divided by $2^m-1$, while the diameter squared is $m^2$ and so the ratio is $$ \lambda_m = \frac{ (m+1) 2^{m-2} }{ m (2^m - 1) } $$ and as $m$ tends to infinity this ratio tends to $1/4$ (which is exactly the value you get by assuming that "most" vertices are at distance $m/2$ from each other). 

To get some feel for the size of a particular computation, I would like to know the approximate number of (pairwise-nonisomorphic) cubic bipartite graphs on $40$ vertices whose bipartite adjacency matrix has determinant $\pm 3$. Just to fix some basic facts and clarify the terminology: 

ADDED: Some more comments and another example. Clearly one way for a regular graph to have this unique-transmission-value property is if every vertex has the same number of vertices at each distance from it. Vertex-transitive graphs, distance-regular graphs, the regular graphs of diameter 2 etc all fall into this category. You could easily fool around with graphs of higher diameter and make the girth high enough to force this to happen. These graphs are likely to be impossible to characterise any more precisely. So the non-regular ones are perhaps more interesting. But here again, we have numerous examples due to Brendan's cartesian product example, so its not clear where to go. But it looks ugly. Here's another example, on 11 vertices, with not much obvious structure. 

I would like to know more about uniquely hamiltonian graphs with minimum vertex degree at least 3, and in particular what is the smallest one. (Recall that a graph is hamiltonian if it has a cycle passing through each vertex exactly once each, and is uniquely hamiltonian if there is only one such cycle.) Here's the smallest one that I currently know. 

I am trying to show that a certain family of graphs can always be properly coloured with at most $6$ colours (where "properly coloured" means that each vertex gets a colour and no edge has both ends the same colour). I'll describe the construction of the family of graphs with a $20$-vertex example, but in general there can be $4k$ vertices. Start with five vertex-disjoint $4$-cliques (i.e $5K_4$) which obviously creates a graph with chromatic number $4$. Now add (to the same vertex set) another "layer" of edges which also form five vertex-disjoint $4$-cliques, with no restriction on how the new cliques overlap the old cliques. The resulting graph will have vertices with degrees between 3 and 6 but, after some thought, it becomes apparent that it still has chromatic number $4$. Finally, add a third layer of edges, which also form five vertex-disjoint $4$-cliques. I'll call this collection of $15$ cliques the defining cliques to distinguish them from any new cliques that may be formed by combining edges from more than one defining clique. If there are no restrictions on how the third set of cliques overlaps the others, then the entire graph can contain a $7$-clique. However if we add the restriction that no two vertices can belong to the same triple of defining cliques, then it is no longer possible to create $7$-cliques, and so it is conceivalbe that they can be coloured with $6$ colours. And this is the question: Do all of these graphs have proper $6$-colourings? I have searched by computer, probably exhaustively, on $20$ vertices and am convinced that there are no graphs of this structure that need $7$ colours. Finding one that does require $7$ colours would help to provide a combinatorial proof of some complicated result that I don't understand, and hence would be A Good Thing (and therefore by Murphy's Law, it won't exist). But for this purpose, it doesn't need to be $20$ vertices, but could instead be any graph on $4k$ vertices formed by the union of three layers with each layer being $k$ vertex-disjoint $4$-cliques, and so I'd like to rule out this avenue entirely, rather than always being tempted to run a few more cases. There are quite a few known results on colouring graphs whose edge set is the union of cliques, but none that have this particular structure. The closest I came is a paper by Klotz who considered graphs whose edge set is the union of overlapping cliques, and gave bounds based on the sizes of the cliques and the maximum number of cliques in which each vertex lies, but his greater generality (the cliques don't have to occur in "layers") gives bounds that are too weak. There are a handful of results about "equivalence subgraphs" which are defined to be disjoint unions of cliques covering the vertex set (i.e. the relationship graph of an equivalence relation), but the few results that I found are mostly about trying to partition graphs into equivalence subgraphs rather than colouring unions of equivalence subgraphs. One can also rewrite the problem by noting that each vertex is uniquely defined by an ordered triple (i.e. 124 would mean that the vertex is in the first clique in Layer 1, the second clique in Layer 2 and the 4th clique in Layer 3) and so we have a set of 20 triples such that each symbol from 1 to 5 occurs exactly four times in each coordinate position. This doesn't seem to help (me). 

In complexity terms, no "efficient" (polynomial time) solution is likely. However in practical terms you may be able to solve quite large problems of this nature, either by using integer linear programming software (I recommend Gurobi) or constraint satisfaction programming software. For example, here is how you would do it in the CSP solver "Minion" Create a file called something like "problem.min" containing the following (notice that I have changed x15 to x[0] to use an array of variables). 

Robertson and Seymour tell us that any minor-closed family of graphs has a finite collection of excluded minors. Standard examples include planar graphs with two excluded minors ($K_5$ and $K_{3,3}$) and knotlessly embeddable graphs with the Petersen family as excluded minors. However in general, a finite list is not necessarily a short list, and there are natural properties with large numbers of excluded minors. In fact, I recall seeing examples where astronomical numbers of excluded minors have been proved to exist - unfortunately for the life of me, I can't remember these examples and I can't find them on MathSciNet. So my question is: please give me references to results that show the existence of vast numbers of excluded minors for natural minor-closed classes of graphs. 

Edit: I looked up some of my old emails and notes and have the following conjecture, inspired by a related conjecture of Dong: If $G$ is a 3-connected graph such that for any independent vertex-cutset $S$, the number of components of $G-S$ is no larger than $|S|$ then $2$ is a single root of the chromatic polynomial. 

Often not, and for lots of different reasons. Citations about related work, background information etc. are often given to give the reader the context of your work, but your work does not necessarily depend on the results therein. Seminal results from decades ago are sometimes in German, French or Russian, and while I might occasionally struggle through papers in the first two languages if I desperately need to see how something was proved, I will usually take the results on trust, especially if they are heavily cited. And then, some results are just too complicated, but are sufficiently well accepted that there is really no choice but to rely on them - most group theorists will use the Classification of Finite Simple Groups when necessary, but few, if any, will understand the full details of the entire proof. On similar lines, I cannot possibly read the Robertson-Seymour series of papers on Graph Minors. Yet I believe the main results in them, and if and when I refer to the fact that any minor-closed class of graphs has a finite set of excluded minors, then it is pretty much obligatory to refer to the relevant paper in the series. If correctness is seriously in doubt, then it would presumably be necessary to work back not just to the papers you cite, but to the papers they cite, and so on. 

I have a copy of the two volumes "Selected Papers of W. T. Tutte" in which his (self-selected) best papers are reprinted with a short commentary preceding each paper. He has the following things to say, the first quote relevant to the directed theorem, and the second to the original theorem. Re: The dissection of equilateral triangles into equilateral triangles (1948) ".. we find a proof of the directed form of the Matrix-Tree theorem. Perhaps this is the most important theorem of the paper, though I did not realize it at the time." Re: The dissection of rectangles into squares (1940) "There seems to be some confusion as to where the Matrix-Tree theorem was first stated. Some say in the paper we are discussing. I think howeve [sic] that Kirchhoff stated it clearly enough in the terminology of his time." 

The minimum value is $37294$ as described by F. Barrera. I broke the symmetry a little by identifying $9$ inequivalent triples of edges to which the primes $\{41,43,47\}$ can be assigned, wrote a constraint satisfaction program for the problem, and then used Minion to solve it. (I am sure there are more efficient ways to do this.) 

This is a very easy problem for the sizes you are proposing... a 20-vertex quartic graph seems to only have a few hundred perfect matchings (random sample), and it takes my computer approximately 2/100ths of a second to count them. This is actually an ideal application for my favourite constraint satisfaction programming solver, namely Minion. It took me 15 minutes to write and test a program that converts a graph into a suitable Minion program, and then the Minion program takes the above-mentioned 2/100ths of a second. I used to write lots of back-tracking programs, but Minion is so good that for almost all applications, it beats a bespoke program by a wide margin, and so nowadays I almost never write my own back-track, but just convert to a Minion program! Here's an example of the Minion program for a 20-vertex graph - there are 40 boolean variables, one for each edge, stored in an array called "ed". The line "sumgeq(ed,10)" says that we need the sum of the 40 variables in the array to be at least 10 (in fact we want exactly 10, but in a strange decision, Minion only allows you to specify equality as a combination of two inequalities). Then for each VERTEX, we need exactly one edge to be chosen, and so we have 40 constraints in 20 pairs, with each pair saying that "at least one", and "at most one", of the edges incident with a particular vertex is chosen. Running this code then takes a few hundredths of a second and produces the answer that there are exactly 364 perfect matchings. 

These graphs do not exist except for the cases you mention. Your conditions imply that your graph has girth $2L+1$ and that it meets the Moore bound for the minimum number of vertices in a graph of valency 3 and girth $2L+1$. Such graphs are known to exist only for $L=1, 2$. For example, when $L=3$, you would need a $22$-vertex cubic graph, but the smallest cubic graph of girth $7$ has $24$ vertices (and it gets worse from there onwards). 

This is some Sage code to check the counterexample posted by user1272680. I can't put this in a comment, so I am putting it as an answer, but the credit should go to user1272680. 

They are called quartic Möbius ladders. They are one of the fundamental classes in Johnson & Thomas's classification of internally 4-connected graphs, and crop up in matroid theory for the same reason. $URL$ 

Yes, Brendan McKay showed that almost all trees have mates that are simultaneously cospectral in both adjacency and Laplacian spectra. And more. $URL$ Edit: I wondered briefly what the smallest pair of such trees would be, and a few minutes of Sage told me that there are two on 11 vertices. And here they are (for some reason I am having difficulty with the image uploader): 

Second Answer I'm adding this as another separate answer, rather than editing the first "answer" because otherwise anyone coming late to this discussion will end up doubly confused. So let's try again, and say that the answer to your question is still "Yes". If you type the following into Sage 

widely and reasonably easily available (should be able to download, compile and install today) general purpose (no particular restrictions to subclasses of graphs), and (ideally) described in a widely available publication, tech report, arxiv paper etc. 

If the group passes those two tests, then it might be CI, and so it has to be checked somehow, either using results from papers like the ones you have quoted or checking by computer. 

This is just to expand a little bit on Brendan's answer. For cubic graphs, there is a construction that gives a large number of uniquely 3-edge colourable graphs: start with $K_4$, and repeatedly insert a vertex of degree 3 into a triangular face. This gives a bunch of uniquely-4-colourable planar triangulations (in fact, it is known that this family contains all the uniquely-4-colourable planar triangulations) so the duals of these graphs form a large class of uniquely 3-edge colourable cubic graphs. Of course, all of these graphs are planar and so at one stage, some optimist conjectured that this was the entire collection of uniquely 3-edge colourable cubic graphs. The $P(9,2)$ example referred to in Brendan's answer is the smallest non-planar cubic graph that is uniquely 3-edge colourable, though lots more such graphs are known. Related to all this is the question of when a cubic graph has exactly 3 Hamilton cycles. Certainly any uniquely 3-edge colourable cubic graph has exactly 3 Hamilton cycles, but the converse is not true. Thomason found a family of cubic graphs (more generalised Petersen graphs) with exactly 3 Hamilton cycles that are not uniquely 3-edge colourable. The smallest of Thomason's examples is $P(15,2)$ and I wonder if this is actually the smallest possible example. Before you ask, Brendan, I have checked up to 26 vertices, so there might be some examples hiding on 28 vertices but no smaller. 

Now vertex $n-$1 has in-degree 1 (from $n-$2) and out-degree 1 (to vertex 0) and so any directed triangle using the special edge must use the edge $(n-2)\rightarrow (n-1)$ as well. But there is no edge from 0 to $n-2$ by construction and so there are no directed triangles. Count 'em all up and you get $(n^2-3n+4)/2$. I've tested this for $n$ up to 8 and the numbers work out... but there is far from a unique graph with that number of edges and so I cannot see any obvious proof
