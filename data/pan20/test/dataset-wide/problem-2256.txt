Subsequent discussions on dynamic behaviour were again in the context of a firefighter escaping, so no actual falls discussed. However the important point is still brought up: 

Instead of going through the first yellow loop as originally shown in the picture below you bypass the yellow loop and go directly through the middle (shown in red, added by myself). So this variation is essentially a standard knot with an extra loop. 

Yes, you should definitely use a spray-on. Arcteryx themselves explicitly state not to use wash-in (product care information) and Gore-Tex does it implicitly by telling you to apply "to the garments outer fabric" (washing instructions). You already stated the reason for this: DWRs function is to keep away the moisture from the "functional" layer to provide better circumstances for moisture getting from the inside to the outside. From the inside it is the opposite: We want the moisture to reach this layer, so there should not be DWR. The following is pure speculation: I guess the makers of wash-in DWR are aware of this and probably designed their product to only or at least mainly adhere to the material of the outside of a garment. However especially the inside material can vary considerably by manufacturer and model, so even if the above is true it is hardly possible to make the wash-in target specific for all these material types. 

There is no "abnormal" risk involved with strength exercises at high altitude. What I mean by "abnormal" is, that there is nothing different about doing body-weight strength exercises compared to e.g. climbing, which is not uncommonly done at such altitudes. You will certainly not be able to do workouts at the same intensity as at low altitudes. It is even quite likely to be a problem, that you won't be able to get to the intensities needed to maintain your current peak strength, due to exhausting your "base endurance" first. And as with all increased activity at high altitude, this might exacerbate existing or reveal new symptoms of AMS. So in the end compared to exercising at low altitude you simply need to adjust your training intensity and listen to your body even more closely (and most importantly, also act accordingly if you feel something). 

So start climbing now indoors, learn rope handling, build endurance and strength and whatever else, but as soon as it is possible, go climb outside. In addition to the factors above, it is also much more fun ;) 

TLDR: This is a very common setup here and intuitively I always thought it was 4:1. So I needed to check more rigorously and the result is: Petzl made their homework, it is 7:1. Let me try to explain (my handwritten notes are unpublishable...). The following derivation is (hopefully) rigorous, but as it is only text and some formulas it is potentially not very helpful to get an understanding of the system. Refer to QuantumBrick's answer with pretty pictures for that and skip to the last paragraph of this answer for some real-world information. Mechanical Advantage First lets be clear about what we mean when we write x:y: This is the mechanical advantage, i.e. the factor with which the needed force is reduced (neglecting other factors like friction). Another way to put it and that's how I am going to derive it: It is the ratio between the distance traveled while pulling behind the blocking device (i.e. the distance the rescuer "travels") divided by the distance before the pulley (i.e. the distance the victim/weight/... "travels"). Layout So lets work on a scale that is 1 at the anchor/blocking device (yellow thing at the top) and 0 at the lower roll (lowest yellow thing). Let A denote the position of lower roll, B the position of the prusik and C the hand of the person pulling the rope. Initial Conditions The idealized position at start of these three points are 

There are rope manufacturers which mark their half ropes in the middle (as an option) or even produce them with different colors on both sides (Beal half ropes). For the reasons already mentioned, this is not standard. When abseiling you use both ropes so the middle is their connection. Still, when climbing alpine routes, I like to have the middle markers for orientation. When climbing one pitch trad routes, I like to use half ropes and there it is good to know, when half of the rope is out (afterwards you cannot lower your partner anymore). Some people even put two marks in the middle and one mark each on one/three quarters. Thus you have even more information about how much rope is still left. 

The answer to the question in your title is simple: This is not redundant. Is this a problem? It is important to realize the following about redundancy in climbing: Mostly there is no complete redundancy in climbing. You climb with one rope, you use one sling for self arrest, ... In rescue operations we have the order to be always redundantly secured and you can believe, the resulting battle of material is exorbitant. Redundancy always comes at the cost of more complexity and weight, so we only want to go redundant if there is no alternative way to achieve the same (reduced) amount of risk. The conclusion is that redundancy is needed where failure is uncertain. This is why we back up bolts and pro. They were not tested (in place), so they may fail without you being able to foresee it. In slings, cordelettes, ropes, harnesses, ... this is not the case. These were tested according to norms, so you can determine whether they are strong enough or not. The maximal force a rope can exert is 10kN (again due to testing according to norms), so the maximal force on any point is twice as high (rope redirection): 20kN. Look at slings and quickdraws: They have strength ratings of 22kN so no chance they will brake. Thats why you don't use redundancy on them. Of course this is only true if everything is in good condition and correctly handled, but thats commonplace. The maximal load onto a cordelette at a belay is 20kN too, so there is no uncertainty. You need to choose the cordelette accordingly and you are save. So the question is whether it is strong enough or not, and not should I use redundancy. As a matter of fact most belays are not built for the worst case: If you belay the leader on your harness, the rope is clipped into the belay and he falls before reaching the first protection there is the chance of such a 20kN load onto the anchor. Very often just one sling with a knot (-50%) is used to connect the bolts and provide a central tie in point, so it can only take 11kN (half the sling rating). This can be mitigated by belaying directly on the belay stating or justified by "being attentive", meaning stopping the fall dynamically and thus reducing the actual load (which will anyway never really reach the 20kN). But technically, that situation is not save, but when is climbing save? Never! We just do our best to reduce risk. 

If you experience these, the condition is already life threatening and you need to descend asap. The usual case is, that you have a mild form of AMS not including any advanced symptoms and you need to make a decision on how to proceed. This depends a lot on logistical factors: Where are you, where do you want to go and how easy can you descend. If your plans allow it, the best option is always to stay and see how the symptoms progress. If you need to go on, you have to factor in escape plans. Assuming you can easily descend, going on is save, just keep track of the symptoms and react accordingly. If going on means committing for a push into an area where the only way out is walking, the save way to go is aborting. The symptoms can get worse fast and impact your ability to walk out severely. This means you will stay longer at high altitude which again makes the AMS worse. Sources: [1] J.

The problem with heat is mostly discussed in caving and canoing communities, as there are commonly huge distances to descend. Still the best source I found was Black Diamond, whose engineers have done some tests on this. They looked at damage to the sling holding the descender device, but the results are still relevant. Some introductory information: 

I think it isn't fair to simu-abseiling to pull out horrific accident reports and use them to say it isn't safe, because there are just as horrific accidents with "traditional" abseiling. The only fair comparison would be if there were numbers of rappels done and numbers of accidents on both styles - I am pretty sure this kind of data doesn't exist. Using the exact procedure and situation described in the question I agree, simu-abseiling is just as safe. However it is in my opinion not meaningful in this case to restrict the scenario to a perfect execution. There are situations where different techniques differ in safety given a defined scenario and not allowing mistakes - this is not one. I don't have numbers ready, but I strongly believe that mistakes are the prime reasons for accidents while abseiling. So what you can meaningfully compare is the complexity of a system and thus chances of making a mistake and the consequences of a mistake. The following is based on armchair thinking: I have done plenty "normal" abseils, but only one simu-abseil (in a controlled environment for fun and the experience). It concerns "risk" which is an extremely complicated issue in itself and the tolerance for risk is a personal choice. In my opinion the first part about higher complexity and thus options to make a mistake is not that bad for simu-abseiling. Then again for me it is unthinkable to not use a backup friction knot on long/multi-pitch abseils (ever had to untie a tangled rope during abseiling?): A backup knot completely removes the risk of unloading the rope while the other end is still loaded (you can't remove a friction knot when loaded). What weighs more in my opinion is the consequences of a mistake. History proves that everyone can make mistakes, so ignoring this aspect would be naive. If you do a mistake (e.g. the classic: going over the rope's end due to missing knot) two people are dead instead of one. So if you consider chance of a mistake to be equal between both options and define risk as chance times consequences you have twice the risk for simu-abseiling. This is likely also the reason why many people consider simu-abseiling instinctively as much less safe. However this is also where human risk perception usually breaks down: Low probability, high consequence. To be fair, not only human perception, this also makes it extremely hard to quantify it. Even if there was data on it, you would need a huge amount of cases to get any significant results. And one aspect that is not safety related: If you do remain attached to each other while abseiling this is a pain. I feel like it is already annoying when just abseiling straight down. However very often I need to search for the next belay or do pendulum to reach it. Doing this in perfect synchronization appears to be an art-form very hard to master. Edit: I probably didn't really answer the question directly, but that also intended. Many of the above is based on arguments, a final answer is a judgment call. And everyone has to do it for themselves. In my opinion there is no reason to demonise simu-abseiling. I don't do it because I believe in keeping to one system that everyone knows. I would be feigning if saying I did it for safety, as I often leave out knots in the end (start the stoning) when going down first myself. 

For maximum efficiency (i.e. melted water per used fuel) make sure the following things are always true: 

Lower stiffness means lower peak forces during a fall, it has the same effect as dynamic belaying. These data suggests that the stiffness reduction is even greater than the reduction of breaking strength. So apparently this is simply not an issue for the upper range of temperatures where climbing ropes are used. 

There are three types of ropes according to the UIAA/EN norm for climbing ropes: Single, half and twin. While the distinction between single ropes and the other two is rather obvious (one strand versus two parallel strands) it is not so clear for half and twin ropes. What are the differences between half and twin ropes, i.e. what can I do with one that the other cannot and/or how do they behave differently? 

There is a notorious kind of crack called offwidths. Several friends of mine stated, that they were pretty devastated at first when they were not able to do 5.8 offwidths in the valley. Later they learnd, that this was quite common. There has even been an epic film called "Wide Boyz" about two british climbers taking on the hardest american offwidths. My questions are: What exactly is an offwidth crack? What makes offwidth hard to climb? Or less subjective: What technique is required ascend an offwidth? 

I am refraining from judging these definitions, as I am not a sailor and two apparently seasoned sailors disagree. Personally I guess there is no "correct" answer, this could depend on different "schools of sailing", location, ... For posterity I am citing two arguments made in comments that were helpful to me: 

Edit addressing the new info about the rope: Please don't use this rope for abseiling. It is not certified and it is marketed with a random selection of catch-words, no actual information about it properties except the diameter and supposed strength (which is useless in the absence of a specified procedure of how they arrived at that number). Old disclaimer without specifics as the rope (still true, but more general): I assume it is a static ("low-stretch") rope. With 3kN it is hardly a climbing rope (EN1891) - I am only aware of cords rated at such a low strength. If it is rated after intended load as often done in "industry" compared to peak/breaking load in climbing that aspect would be fine. If it is rated by max/peak/breaking load, then 300kN is not enough. The knot will further decrease this, meaning you won't have enough safety margin. In any case the question still remains: Is such a rope suited for the abseil you are setting up (rock contact)? Actual answer to which knot to use That being said the goto knot around here is a figure of eight. One reason is the same as for it's use to connect your harness to the rope: It is simple and easy to control. It also means, you don't need to introduce a new knot to a beginner. And it is reasonably simple to undo. There's also the aspect of decreased strength of the rope when knotting it. That's not an issue with "normal" climbing ropes. Even the worst knot in that aspect won't bring the strength so far down, that it gets problematic. In general the smaller the radii in a knot, the more strength reduction (so bowline is better than eight better than overhand, all on bight). This is a gross over-simplification, knots are extremely complex and this won't hold true in all cases, it's just a rule of thumb. And again, simplicity to tie, inspect and untie are more important (that's why bowline isn't used for this around here - nothing wrong with using that though). 

As EN norms are not publicly available and quite costly, I can't confirm for sure that there is no temperature testing - but from what I hear there is none. If anyone can authoritatively confirm or deny this, please write a comment. The first impulse is to look into fire-fighting resources. Problem there: Their requirement far exceed what a climber is interested in. According to this blog entry the NFPA "Standard on Life Safety Rope and Equipment for Emergency Services" requires rope to withstand a load of 300lbs for 45s at 600degC and 5min at 400degC. One resource of which the relevant part is available through google books is Dynamic Behavior of Materials, Volume 1. They made tests on a Nylon kernmantle rope with 9mm diameter. Unfortunately, it is again in the context of fire-fighting, meaning a rope fulfilling NFPA1983 was used. However it is Nylon as well, so the temperature properties should be the same/similar. Static tests were done at room temperature, 100degC and 200 degC. The observed changes in breaking strength (static) relative to room temperature were: 

I have not yet seen any GPS capable watch that has such a long battery live. GPS watches like Suunto Ambit and Garmin Fenix do advertise longer battery live, but these durations are only reached when turning GPS off. That will hardly change, as battery technology hasn't changed and there is nothing that will in the short term as far as I know. The Suunto Ambit 3 advertises 50h lifetime with lowest interval GPS (1 per min). Assuming you are on the move for 10h a day, this means 5 days lifetime The solution is simple: Go with any watch that is battery efficient and meets your need and get battery to recharge it. There are no official numbers I am aware of, but the circulating value is 300-500mAh for typical battery capacities. This seems about right judging from the size. This means a small and cheap USB powerbank of e.g. 3000mAh will keep it running for 20d plus some extra.
