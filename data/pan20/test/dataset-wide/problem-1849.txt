Short answer : you don't. If she's your boss you don't get to fire her. From what you say about her, explaining to her why she's not a good fit for the job won't make her go away. And "creative ideas" that come to mind are basically harassment et illegal in most countries. The only thing you can do, if she's not on top of the food chain, is talking about this issue to her boss. But you not being happy with her work doesn't mean her boss isn't. So don't put to mut expactations in it. 

Your boss wanting you to handle tasks that are outside your job description is an entirely different issue. Tell him what you're doing. You will never find a reason that justifies hiding what you are doing to your manager. A book could probably be written about why this is a terrible idea, but here are a few thoughts : 

The priority is to have ONE meeting with your supervisor to talk about this issue. Make it happen. Offer to meet him at lunch time, to stay a bit later one evening... Insist on the fact that this is really important and will make both of your jobs easier in the future. During this meeting, you'll want to discuss two topics : 

Noone but you can answer the first part of your question. How much frustration can you take? Are the good personal aspects enough compensation for the frustration you feel about your work? Putting all that in the balance is entirely up to you. As for the second part of your question, I wouldn't worry. You seem to have legitimate reasons to quit, so explaining why you left in a future interview shouldn't be a problem. 

Even though I do, in your case I wouldn't. And certainly not in the Skills section. I've always mentioned my chess skills on my resume, but in the Hobbies section. Feedback was never negative, ranging from one quick slightly intrigued question to a longer discussion with genuine respectful interest. In many people's mind chess is linked to intelligence (it's complete crap obviously, there are dumb people in chess as in any other part of the population), strategic thinking etc. It might also be viewed as a sign of nerdiness (again, cliches die hard) but hey I work in IT so I'm already assumed to have a 50% chance to be an autistic geek :) Seriously it's a good way to tell a bit more about myself in a way that is generally perceived positively, and several times served as an ice-breaker once we were done with the regular hr/technical questions. But it's not intended to prove anything regarding my skillset. That being said, I would only mention playing chess, not that tournament. To be honest it's just not that impressive. If they show some interest and start discussing your hobby then you can talk about it. 

Anyway, don't forget that as your supervisor he's expected to make time for you. You're not a developer yet, there's a lot you have to learn, and him making efforts to help you improve is beneficial for both of you. Don't feel guilty for requiring attention or see yourself as a burden. Well let's face it, you most likely are a burden at the time. But one he signed up for :) 

You could probably have deduced that from their attitude : if 1s after saying "thank you, we'll be in touch" they were heads down on their notes like you don't exist you should just answer politely and get out. If they kept looking at you, stood up or moveb a bit towards you, that might have been an invitation to shake hands. This is extremely culture/country dependant, but here's the rule of thumb I apply at work (in France) : the person with the highest position offers or not the handshake. In your situation, I wouldn't have come to shake interviewers' hands if not "invited" (even with just a body language hint) to. 

I agree with Wesley Long's answer about internship and employment being likely two different recruitment processes, and thus not being accepted as an intern not killing your chances for a job. It's at least worth trying. However I'd like to answer the last paragraph of your question. Registering with a different email adress hoping they won't connect the dots is a terrible idea. If they find out - and they are very likely to - your chances are blown. Do not ever lie to or try to hide something from a recruiter, that's the best and possibly only way to make absolutely sure you don't get a job. Instead, bring it up yourself, and insist on how you improved in the past months. Make them curious enough about how you changed and fight for your job in the following interview. 

Of course there's a way to handle this situation. Talk to your manager ! If this situation makes you unable to work efficiently, this is bad for your, your manager and the project. This has to stop one way or another. But the odds are your manager really thinks he's being helpful, and if you don't bring up the issue he has no reason to change his behavior. Obvisouly you don't want to just tell him "get the hell off my back" or anything close. But I'd suggest something along the lines of "Hey, I have the feeling we spend so much time discussing the project that I can't make it progress as fast as I could. What do you think about having a meeting once (twice if timing is really important and every hour counts) a day and I focus on my code the rest of the time ?" 

I can't see why different projects taking different time to finish would be surprising to your boss. They are, by definition, not the same. If some took longer than planned, that's a different issue. Either way, stick to the facts. From what you're saying (btw you might want to edit and add a few more details so we can answer you better) there is no reason to assume your boss is asking in an "hostile" way (like "ok, so where did you fuck up?"). Maybe he just wants to know what happened so he can plan things more accurately next time, and/or divide the tasks in a more efficient way 

Just have a talk with him. Don't be agressive, but firm. Something like "Look, I feel like things have been a little tense between us since our dispute about X. We didn't agree on this point, but that shouldn't keep us from working efficiently together. I respect your work and opinion, so let's put all this behind us and get back to work." (phrasing is far from perfect I guess, English not being my mother tongue, but you get the idea). After that, two things can happen : either he gets his shit together, and problem is fixed, or he keeps on "playing dumb". In that second case you have a problem that probably needs to be adressed by your manager. Point being, if you let things as they are it won't get better, your work quality will decrease and it's gonna come back and bite you in the ass at some point. You can't let that happen. Note : The answer above assumes you didn't get the wrong idea about what's going on. Maybe, and it's your best case scenario, he got over it and latest performance issues aren't related to your former dispute. 

Neither. In many countries threatening someone is a crime. Your friend should take a screenshot of the Facebook post (or have it done by the person who reported the threat) and go to the authorities. And of course be extremly careful until the issue is dealt with one way or another. 

Well there's a different between no passion and lack of interest. I work as a IT security consultant. I can't say I'm passionate about my job, but I still find it interesting. I don't go to work just thinking about the moment I will be able to leave, but once I leave the office I have other things on my mind and don't spend all my time on "geek stuff" (not judging anyone here, english isn't my native language so I can't find a more appropriate word). What I mean is this : your job doesn't have to be a passion for you to be efficient. If you just can find an interest in it there is no reason why your productivity should suffer from it. However, if you just find it boring and absolutely not interesting, you have two options : 

That's pretty simple : practice. A lot. That's the only way you're gonna get better. Your example of forgetting simple coding methods such as storing data in an array is typical from someone who hasn't produced enough code in his life. Sure, if you read how to do it on Google and copy-paste it once to complete your homework you won't remember it. If you do it twenty times in various exercices, you will. I assume you're (or soon to be) fresh out of college. Interviewers don't expect you to know everything (of course they don't expect you to be completely ignorant either). Don't lie to them. Just work so that there soon will be only a few questions you have to answer "I don't know" to, and you'll be fine 

I for one would go for the second option. We spend a significant portion of our time working, and the odds are working 40h per week on something you don't like will just make you miserable. But this is just my opinion. At the end of the day, it's up to you to find the right balance between the interest you have in your job, the money you make, and other pros and cons (free time, people you work with etc). 

The only way not to make it obvious you're selling your previous work is not to send the resume. Which, if you ask me, is a poor strategy to get a job. Recruiters don't like modesty. They like past achievments and skills you can tell them about. And there's nothing desperate about applying for a job and showing why you're a good fit for it (especially in IT which is a wonderful employment area where recruiters are typically more in demand than potential employees), it's job-hunting 101. Remember your resume will likely end up in a pool of 30 that some HR guy will screen in a few minutes total to select the 5-6 ones he's gonna look further into. Discretion is NOT the way you want to play this. 

Generally speaking, when the client requirements are very vague, what you should do is write down what you're about to do (i.e. technical and functional specifications) and have them validate the document . This way, if they want to change something during the project, you can point out that this is not what was agreed and charge them for it. At least equally important is the fact that they can't blame you for doing it "the wrong way". If your project is not too advanced, I'd still try to make this happen. It may seem like a loss of time on the short term but it will keep you from a lifetime of changes implementation. If you're almost done (discarding the endless list of soon-to-come changes obviously), well that's more complicated. You're looking at damage-control here. Have, preferably in written, your manager acknowledge that. You don't want to be a scapegoat if the project becomes really messy. To put it bluntly, this looks like poor project management to me. I'd have a talk with the manager to avoid this situation in the future 

I'd advise you to have a deeper look at those security settings. When I was looking for my first job after college I changed them, now all non-friend people can see are my name and profile picture. Just make sure you aren't naked on this picture and you'll be fine 

How to interact with him : tell him you know he's a very busy man, and you'd rather find an efficient way to communicate rather than bothering him at random times. This can be a daily five minutes stand-up meeting, a weekly presentation associated with a progress recap email every evening... What to do when you can't interact with him : him being busy doesn't change the fact that you're an intern, and thus need to be closely managed and taught. If he can't do that himself, have him introduce you to the people you can turn to about technical difficulties or whatever. 

Don't overthink this. Something like "September 2016 - BS Computer Science diploma (graduation : 04/17)" will be perfectly fine. Though it's not the most common it's definitely not unheard of, and it's unlikely to confuse the HR guy who will read your resume. 

Answers above are perfectly right in my opinion, but in case you're not totally convinced yet I'd like to add a few words about the company's perspective. The odds are they expect you (or at the very least, will be far from shocked if you do) to ask them to contribute to travel expenses. It's no secret that a student is unlikely to be able to spend that much money for a trip that is not 100% sure to get him a job. If they interviewed fresh-out of school candidates before you're probably not the first one in this situation. On the other end, even if they are ready to pay for the plane tickets, hotel and so on, there is no point for them to offer it first. If you don't say a thing and pay for the trip yourself, they save money. If you ask them to contribute, well that's money they already planed to invest. 

The answer already is in your post. Your boss told you to inform him if you had problems with that coworker. From what you say, you didn't. It's his job to fix this kind of trouble in the company. Go to him, calmly explain what you're going through and how it affects your work. If nothing comes out of this interview, you indeed may have to consider leaving before this drives you insane. Speaking of insanity, when talking to your boss, don't use terms like "sociopath". Stick to the facts. Your coworker acts like a bully and a gigantic asshole. But this kind of psychiatric diagnosis you're probaly not entitled to make may look pretty agressive towards someone who, remember, your boss once founded a company with.
