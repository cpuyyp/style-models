The question is: if I assert in ZF that there exists a Reinhardt cardinal, do I really get a theory of higher consistency strength than when I assert in ZFC that there exists an I0 cardinal (the strongest large cardinal not known to be inconsistent with choice, as I understand)? This is implicit in the ordering of things on Cantor's Attic, for example, but I've been unable to find a proof (granted, I don't necessarily have the best nose for where to look!). One thing that worries me is that when there is a ZFC analog of a ZF statement, many equivalent formulations of the ZFC statement may become inequivalent in ZFC. So we don't have much assurance that the usual definition of a Reinhardt cardinal is "correct" in the absence of choice. I think it should be clear that Con(ZF + Reinhardt) implies Con(ZF + I0). But again, it's not clear that ZF+I0 is equiconsistent with ZFC+I0. It's apparently not possible to formulate Reinhardt cardinals in a first-order way, so I should really talk about NBG + Reinhardt, or maybe ZF($j$) + Reinhardt, where ZF($j$) has separation and replacement for formulas involving the function symbol $j$. EDIT Since this question has attracted a bounty from Joseph Van Name, maybe it's appropriate to update it a bit. Now, I'm not actually a set theorist, but it's not even clear to me that Con(ZF + Reinhardt) implies Con(ZFC + an inaccessible). So perhaps the question should really be: what large cardinal strength, if any, can we extract from the theory ZF + Reinhardt? 

It follows that $\mathcal{C}$ admits a two-sided calculus of fractions if and only if both $\mathrm{Ex}^1 \mathcal{C}$ and $\mathrm{Ex}^1 \mathcal{C}^\mathrm{op}$ are Kan complexes. Meier and Ozornova also suggest (Question 2 at the end) that there might be notions of ``$n+1$-arrow calculus" giving clean characterizations of $\mathrm{Ex}^n \mathcal{C}$ being a Kan complex -- which in particular would recover the result that the weak equivalences in a model category admit a 3-arrow calculus, since they are Kan after applying $\mathrm{Ex}^2$. Finally, Meier and Ozornova provide examples answering your actual question in the negative. Finite sets and injections (Example 5.1) form a partial model category whose weak equivalences do not admit a left calculus of fractions. More pertinently (Example 5.3), $\mathsf{Cat}$ with the Thomason model structure is itself a model category which does not admit a calculus of left fractions. Note, though, that the weak equivalences in a left (resp. right) proper model category admits a left resp. right) caculus of fractions. 

First, a clarification: what are the morphisms of locally cartesian closed categories meant to be? Now, a word on the "two adjoints" thing. For every category $C$, there is a cocartesian fibration $\mathrm{cod}: C^{\Delta[1]} \to C$ with fiber $C/c$ over $c \in C$; reindexing is given by composition. $C$ has pullbacks if and only if $\mathrm{cod}$ is simultaneously a cartesian fibration (i.e. it is a bifibration); reindexing is given by pullback. If $C$ has pullbacks, then the cartesian fibration $\mathrm{cod}$ classifies a functor $C^\mathrm{op} \to \mathsf{Cat}$. This functor is also classified by a cocartesian fibration $\overline{\mathrm{cod}}: E \to C^\mathrm{op}$ (different from $\mathrm{cod}$). In the "total category" $E$, an object over $c \in C^\mathrm{op}$ is a map $f: d \to c$ in $C$, while a morphism from $f$ to $f'$ over $\gamma: c \leftarrow c'$ is a map $c \times_d c' \to d'$. Now $C$ is locally cartesian closed if and only if the cocartesian fibration $\overline{\mathrm{cod}}$ is simultatneously a cartesian fibration. Pavlovic calls such a functor a "trifibration"; his paper is referenced in the nlab page on bifibrations linked to above. The process of straightening a cartesian fibration and then unstraightening it to get a cocartesian fibration may sound unwieldy in the $\infty$-categorical setting, but it has been studied by Barwick, Glasman, and Nardin, and I think they give a more direct construction. Upshot: This allows one to check that (small) locally cartesian closed categories form a presentable category, since they lie in a pullback diagram of accessible right adjoints between such: $\require{AMScd} \begin{CD} Cat^{lcc} @>>> Cat^{cart} \\ @VVV @VVV\\ Cat^{pb} @>>> Cat^{\Delta[1]} \end{CD}$ 

EDIT Just for concreteness, here are the non-degenerate simplices in dimension 3: For $Idem^+_\mathrm{old}$: A 3-simplex is an (unlabeled) set of disjoint nonempty subintervals of $[3]$, which is nondegenerate iff each subinterval has exactly one element and each "gap:" between subintervals (including the gaps at the beginning and end) have at most one element. So a nondegenerate 3-simplex can be specified by a set of numbers between 0 and 3 (each representing a singleton interval). They are: $\begin{align*} \{0,1,2\}, \{0,1,3\}, \{0,2,3\}, \{1,2,3\},\{0,2\}, \{1,3\}, \{1,2\}, \{0,1,2,3\} \end{align*}$ for a total of 6 8. For $Idem^+_\mathrm{new}$: A 3-simplex is a sequence of 3 composable morphisms in the free split idempotent $A^{\overset{i}{\to}}_{\underset{r}{\leftarrow}} X \overset{e}{\to} X$, and it's nondegenerate if none of them are the identity. They are: $\begin{align*} (i,r,i), (i,e,r), (i,e,e), (r,i,r), (r,i,e), (e,r,i), (e,e,r), (e,e,e) \end{align*}$ for a total of 8. 

Note: I originally posted an answer claiming the opposite, and then deleted it because it was wrong. I have since reworked it and made this post community wiki. This doesn't directly answer your question, but you may be interested to know that the conjecture is true in the infinite case. In fact, for every infinite $\kappa$ there are $2^\kappa$ categories with $\leq\kappa$ morphisms, up to equivalence or isomorphism, $2^\kappa$ of which are monoids. Of course, in the infinite case, it's more general to ask how many categories there are with $<\kappa$ morphisms rather than $\leq \kappa$ morphisms, but I think this question is more complicated. On the one hand, $2^\kappa$ is an obvious upper bound on the number of categories with $\leq \kappa$ morphisms: since composition is a partial binary operation on the set of morphisms, there are at most $\sum_{\lambda \leq \kappa} 2^{\lambda \times \lambda \times \lambda} \leq \kappa 2^\kappa = 2^\kappa$ categories with $\leq \kappa$ morphisms. On the other hand, it's easy to find $\kappa$-many pairwise-inequivalent connected categories with $\leq\kappa$ morphisms: for instance, it suffices to consider the oridnals $<\kappa$. By taking disjoint unions of these, we get $2^\kappa$ pairwise-inequivalent categories with $\leq \kappa$ morphisms. We can tweak this construction to get $2^\kappa$ pairwise-inequivalent monoids. For each $S\subseteq \kappa$, we can adjoin a bottom element to $\coprod_{\lambda \in S} \lambda$ to get a semilattice $(\coprod_{\lambda \in S} \lambda)_{\bot}$, and then consider the corresponding monoid under $\vee$. We obtain $2^\kappa$ monoids this way by taking different $S$, and they are still pairwise nonisomorphic as monoids, because a monoid isomoprhism entails a semilattice isomorphism, which entails an isomorphism of the original disjoint-union categories, which are clearly pairwise inequivalent. 

I'm still unclear on what the motivation for looking at such a model structure might be, so I'm going to go ahead and guess that what you're ultimately interested in, Fosco, is an alternate construction of the usual model structure on $\mathrm{Set}_\Delta^+$ constructed in HTT 3.1.3.7 (where we take $S$ to be a point). Apologies if I'm guessing wrong! Verity's approach: Verity almost does this. To see this, recall that a stratified simplicial set in Verity's sense is a simplicial set equipped with certain "thin" simplicies which can have arbitrary dimension $\geq 1$ (and it's required that every degenerate simplex is thin). Verity constructs a model structure on the category $\mathrm{Strat}$ of stratified simplicial sets whose fibrant objects are what Verity calls weak complicial sets. A marked simplicial set can be considered as a stratified simplicial set by taking a 1-simplex to be thin iff it is marked, and taking all simplices of dimension $\geq 2$ to be thin. Then Verity's model structure on $\mathrm{Strat}$ restricts to a model structure on $\mathrm{Set}_\Delta^+$. The only caveat is that Verity's model structure needs to be further localized, by a "Rezk completeness condition". That is, in his model structure, every fibrant marked simplicial set will have the property that every marked simplex is an equivalence, but will not necessarily have the converse property that every equivalence is marked. This needs to be enforced by a Bousfield localization. This is not hard to do, but I'm not sure it's been done in the literature. The Cisinski/Olschok approach: It's notable that Verity's construction of his model structure is very much analogous to Joyal's construction of the Joyal model structure, which in turn is essentially an application of Cisinski's theory of model structures on Grothendieck topoi. The only reason that Cisinski's theory can't be directly applied to marked simplicial sets is that marked simplicial sets don't actually form a topos! But that's okay -- Olschok has extended Cisinski's theory to general locally presentable categories. Olshok's theory is a very general method for constructing model structures from a set of generating cofibrations, a set of elementary anodyne extensions, and a functorial cylinder object. In order to apply Olschok's theory, we must simply identify a class of elementary anodyne extensions and a functorial cylinder object (it's easy to write down a set of generating cofibrations such that the cofibrations are exactly the monomorphisms). The elementary anodyne extensions from Verity's paper (supplemented by a morphism corresponding to Rezk completeness), and the functorial cylinder given by $X \mapsto X \times \Delta[1]_t$ (where $\Delta[1]_t$ is the marked 1-simplex) yield the usual model structure. Olschok's theory allows us to identify the fibrant objects and fibrations between fibrant objects in this model structure, via lifting against the elementary anodyne extensions, if we additionally verify that the anodyne extensions are closed under certain pushouts involving the functorial cylinder; This is a straightforward combinatorial exercise. 

One can left-induce a model structure from $\mathsf{Cat}$ to $\mathsf{RelCat}$ along the "homotopy category" functor. The weak equivalences are the relative functors which induce equivalences of homotopy categories, which is good. The cofibrations are the injective-on-objects relative functors, and the acyclic fibrations are the equivalences which are retracts in $\mathsf{RelCat}$. If I'm not mistaken, the existence of this model structure follows from the main result of Hess, Kedziorek, Riehl, and Shipley. (In case it's not clear, $\mathsf{Cat}$ is the category of categories, $\mathsf{RelCat}$ is the category of relative categories (the "simplest" model of $\infty$-categories), and we're left-inducing the canonical model structure on $\mathsf{Cat}$ along the adjunction $h: \mathsf{RelCat} \overset{\to}{\leftarrow} \mathsf{Cat}: i$, where $iC$ is the relative category with underlying category $C$ with just the isomorphisms being weak equivalences and $hD$ is the homotopy category of the relative category $D$.) In some ways, this model structure is charmingly simple, and it has the right weak equivalences, but I can't find mention of it in Barwick and Kan. I also don't know a good generating set of acyclic cofibrations, nor do I really understand fibrations. So a few questions: 

$p$ preserves pullbacks. $p$ is an isofibration, and induces an isofibration on all slices (perhaps this is redundant?). $p$ reflects identities (i.e. if $f: c \to c$ is an endomorphism in $C$, and $pf: pc \to pc$ is an identity, then so is $f$). There is a cardinal $\kappa$ such that for every $f: x \to c \in C^{[1]}$, the isomorphism class $[f]$ of $f$ in the fiber category $p^{-1}(pf) \subseteq C/c$ has cardinality $\kappa$. 

It should definitely be mentioned here that one often-used categorification of the integers is the sphere spectrum, $\mathbb S$, i.e. the infinite loop space $\mathbb S = \varinjlim \Omega^n S^n$. I've heard this idea attributed to Waldhausen. There's a fun exposition in TWF 102 by John Baez. The idea is to think of $\mathbb Z$ is the (additive) group completion of the rig $\mathbb N$, and to categorify the group completion process. A natural categorification of the rig $\mathbb N$ is the 2-rig $\mathsf{FinBij}$ of finite sets and bijections, with $\times$ distributing over $\amalg$. So we group complete $\mathsf{FinBij}$ the $\amalg$ part. The thing is, rather than creating a 1-groupoid with two monoidal structures and the appropriate universal property, it's more natural to regard $\mathsf{FinBij}$ as an $\infty$-groupoid with two monoidal structures, and to construct a group completion in the world of $\infty$-groupoids. But by the homotopy hypothesis, an $\infty$-groupoid is the same thing as a space. So we end up with a space that has two monoidal structures, one distributing over the other. The "additive" monoidal structure is appropriately commutative, so this structure can be regarded as the structure of an infinite loop space, otherwise known as a connective spectrum. And the multiplicative structure makes it a "multiplicative infinite loop space", otherwise known as a ring spectrum. Note that $\pi_0(\mathbb S) = \mathbb Z$, so this is a categorification in the most basic sense.

Summary. Use Chris's argument to show that an autoequivalence $F: \hoCat \to \hoCat$ restricts to the identity on the free categories $\Free = \hoFree$ (possibly after composing with the known autoequivalence $(-)^\mathrm{op}: \hoCat \to \hoCat$). As Chris then argues, $\mathsf{Free}$ forms a (large) regular generator in $\hoCat$, and it follows that $F$ is essentially the identity on objects. We just need the slightly stronger statement that $\Free$ is a (large) dense generator to show that $F$ is also the identity on morphisms. It turns out that the $\Cat$-functoriality of the presentations of categories is enough to guarantee this, even though these presentations are not actually functorial on $\hoCat$. In fact, this argument generalizes to show that if the category of algebras for a monad is modded out by a congruence relation, then the free algebras still form a dense generator in the resulting category $\widetilde{\mathcal{C}^T}$ if the canonical coequalizer diagrams descend. Details. 

A similar place where two interacting monoidal structures come up is in duoidal categories. I believe that any star-autonomous category, i.e. a symmetric monoidal closed category with a dualizing object, is an example of a quadratic category. I have only checked a fraction of the coherence diagrams, though. Examples: 

(1) corresponds to $\phi$ respecting scalar multiplication, (2) corresponds to $\phi$ respecting addition, and (3) is a special case of $\phi$ respecting multiplication which I believe generates all cases thereof. Question: Is a multiplicative monoid homomorphism satisfying (1),(2), and (3) something that has a name? (2), in particular, looks very suggestive -- it seems like a sort of inclusion-exclusion principle. 

I agree with Tyler that it's not clear what the universal property of, say $S^l C$ is supposed to be. Does a functor $G: S^l C \to D$ correspond to (i) a functor $F: C \to D$ with the property that $F(s)$ is a left inverse for every $s \in S$ or (ii) a functor $F: C \to D$ along with, for every $s \in S$, a choice of right inverse $\rho_s$ to $F(s)$, or (iii) something like (ii), but with $\rho_s$ required to be functorial in $s$, or (iv) something else? I don't believe that an object with the universal property (i) exists outside of degenerate cases, maybe. A category with the universal property (iii) should be obtainable in a straightforward way by deleting some of the identifications in the description of Gabriel-Zisman localization. 

Claim: Let $C$, $D$ be categories with pullbacks, and suppose there is a functor $p: C \to D$ with the following properties: 

If a dualizing object exists, there is a bijection between isomorphism classes of dualizing objects and isomorphism classes of $\otimes$-invertible objects (i.e. the Picard group), given by tensoring your favorite dualizing object by a $\otimes$-invertible object. So the groupoid of $\ast$-autonomous structures, if nonempty, is equivalent to the groupoid of $\otimes$-invertible objects (canonically as soon as one chooses a basepoint -- it's a torsor over the grouplike symmetric monoidal groupoid of $\otimes$-invertible objects). One direction: First let's check that if $D$ is dualizing and $L$ is $\otimes$-invertible (with inverse $L^\vee$), then $L\otimes D$ is dualizing. Write $[,]$ for the internal hom (sorry, I seem to be changing all of your notation :). Then $\begin{align*} [[A, L\otimes D], L\otimes D] &= [L^\vee \otimes [A, L\otimes D], D] \\ &= [L^\vee \otimes L \otimes [A,D],D] \\ &= [[A,D],D] \\ &= A \end{align*}$ I suppose I should verify that the above isomorphism is the canonical morphism $A \to [[A, L\otimes D], L\otimes D]$, but since all the isomorphisms used were canonical, maybe I'll just wave my hands and ask rhetorically, "what else could it be?". The converse: In fact, it's always the case that any two dualizing objects differ by tensoring by a $\otimes$-invertible object. Here's a proof. 

A strict algebra of the squaring monad is precisely a strict factorization system. A normal pseudo-algebra (unit holds strictly) is precisely an orthogonal factorization system. See here. The pseudo-algebras will differ by first replacing a morphism by an isomorphic morphism before factoring it. So that's what the pseudo-algebras look like. You can read off from this a description of the strictified monad. 

The theorem (found in Grayson, Higher Algebraic K-Theory II, last theorem on p. 11 [1]) is that when every exact sequence splits, these two constructions are equivalent: $\Omega BC \simeq \Omega Q C$. It seems to me the idea of the comparison should be as follows. In the bar construction $BC$, an $n$-simplex consists of an object $c \in C$ equipped with a decomposition as the direct sum of $n$ objects $c = c_{0,1} \oplus c_{1,2} \dots \oplus c_{n-1,n}$. Whereas in $S_\bullet C$, an $n$-simplex consists of an object $c \in C$ equipped with the structure of an $n$-step filtration in $C$ $c_{0,1} \hookrightarrow c_{0,2} \dots \hookrightarrow c_{0,n} = c$ (the indices here are chosen to agree with the $S_\bullet$ construction). In fact, there's a natural map $S_\bullet C \to B C$ sending a filtration to its associated graded. The point should be that the fiber of this map is contractible when every exact sequence splits. Assuming exact sequences split, the fiber over a given "associated graded" is connected, and its automorphisms are automorphisms $c \to c$ which are "upper triangular" (with $1$'s on the diagonal) with respect to the direct sum decomposition. Hence the heuristic. Question: This heuristic argument seems compelling to me, but again, I don't quite see how to read Grayson's proof as a formalization of this line of thinking. Is there somewhere where this heuristic argument is made precise? If I'm totally off-base, I'd appreciate any conceptual illumination of this theorem. It's also possible that glossing over the difference between the $S^{-1} S$ construction and the $\Omega B S$ construction, and the difference between the $Q$-construction and the $S_\bullet$ construction, are getting me into trouble here. Edit: I'm now convinced I don't know a relevant sense in which the group of upper-triangular matrices is contractible to begin with -- just the fact that this would be true if we were working in the the Euclidean topology over $\mathbb R$. So maybe getting a handle on that is the first step. [1] It may appear from the structure of the paper that Grayson's argument relies on a homology computation and comparison to the plus construction, but this is not the case -- the comparison to the plus construction separates out cleanly in the logic of the paper, and the comparison I'm talking about is in fact reasonably direct, just not quite as conceptually clear as I would dream it could be. Specifically, the theorem in question really proves that $S^{-1} S \simeq \Omega QC$ (the part I'm interested in) and combines this with the homology computation showing that $S^{-1} S = K_0R \times BGL(R)^+$.
