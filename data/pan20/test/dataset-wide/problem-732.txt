Most of the ones that I've seen are all battery powered – there is one, Shy Spy, that appears to have an inductive charger. The problem that I imagine with a dynamo powered tracker is that the power cable could lead the thief to the location of the tracker on your bike. Another option would be to have the tracker generate its own power. The Connected Cycle Pedals do that. 

Get something now. Winter is coming… Seriously though, if you don't have a good feel for what you want in a bike, buying something used that seems close will get you on the road and start you developing the experience you need to decide what you really want. There are so many variables of fit and gearing that it will be hard to get it right the first time (at least that's been my experience, both with my own bikes and with helping friends and family pick bikes). Add to that commuting and getting back in shape and I think you'd be way better off buying whatever seems best now on craigslist and using it to help you sort out what you really want. A few months into it you'll be in better shape and have some real life experience to guide you in picking your next bike. Finally there are things you may not have thought of that can make or break a commute – decent lights, riding clothes, a way to carry your gear – that will all add to the cost. Better to spend as little as necessary and have money on hand to add to your kit as you learn what you need to enjoy commuting on your bike. Wait! There's one more thing… If you buy a relatively decent used bike the value won't change too much over the next 6 months or a year – especially if you take good care of it. So if you decide it isn't the right bike you can get a good portion of what you paid back when you sell it. This will be less true if you get a new bike and then decide to either sell it or start upgrading components. 

Make sure the bike is fitting you well – on the weekend ride maybe 16 or 20 miles in one go. See how you feel, especially note where you notice the extra distance. The consult with your LBS about how to improve your comfort on the bike – this will pay off on all of your rides. If you experiments with fit point towards the saddle, get a more comfortable one – as soon as possible – a good saddle is a revelation and many bike shops (in the US at least) will allow you to return a saddle that isn't comfortable. Give yourself some time with this one before your holiday if you can. Don't buy a new saddle until you are sure that fit is right. If you do get a new saddle, keep the old one in case you decide to sell your bike. Good saddles aren't cheap, but you can "take them with you." I'd seek the advice of others who've ridden that particular route to find out if different tires are in order. If you're on dirt, it might make sense to get some tires with a bit more tread to them. Pedals are also worth considering, but you'll get a debate going – there are reasonable people on both sides of the fence. But if you go with clipless pedals that also means shoes. 

The sounds you heard were the spokes unwinding as the pressure in the tire relieved some of the tension in the rim. As you tighten the spoke nipples the spokes tend to "wind up" due to the friction between the threads in the nipple and the threads of the spoke. If the friction is high enough (old corroded spokes/nipples or a lack of lubrication on the spoke threads) you're just winding up the spoke. As you true a wheel, pay attention to the spokes – are they moving with the nipple, or are you actually able to tighten the nipple on the spoke. One place where you can easily see this is by watching the "back" of the nipple on the inside of the rim. Add some light oil if necessary to help lubricate the threads. Expect some wind up, it is pretty much unavoidable. To release the wound up spokes you can put the wheel down on a hard surface and press down gently on the rim. Work your way around the wheel pressing down on the rim – you should hear the spokes unwinding and perhaps feel them moving as well. Do it on both sides of the wheel. That should go a long way towards resolving the problem. For what it is worth I never true new wheels with the tire on. 

I've been quite happy using Cyclemeter (the iPhone version). I use it with a Wahoo RFLKT+ to get a display and ANT+ bridge. There are also some good looking mounts available, I really like the looks of the Rokform mounts but I haven't used them. 

The most reliable way to compare tire sizes is to use the ISO / ERTRO sizing. Most tires will be marked with it. Look for a number like this "32-630" (the ISO equivalent of 27 x 1 1/4). As long as you the second number, the bead seat diameter in millimeters, is 630 the tire will fit on the rim. The first number, 32 in this case, is the width of the tire, also in millimeters. That number can vary a bit without problem. If you go much wider you may have issues with clearance at the chain stays or perhaps the fork crown. Within reason, narrower won't be a problem. 27 x 1 1/4 seems to be the most common 27 inch size still made, but there are some others. Take a look at the 27 inch listings at Bike Tires Direct for example. 

I think the other problem with trying to both do the research, and then present it, is that there are so many ways to define the "problem" and so many valid criteria for evaluating "best" or "optimal." To use your chain example, and just off the top of my head, are we talking about: 

Surprisingly small changes can make a big difference in your comfort on a bike. If your frame is only an inch or so too small you can probably make it fit – or at least significantly improve the fit. I know this from long experience being too tall for common off-the-shelf bikes and too poor to get a custom frame built. You're getting some good advice, and you could almost certainly (in the US at least) spend less on getting a bike that fits by selling your current bike and buying a used bike in the right size – but you know your constraints better than we do… A frame that is too small will likely put you in a position where you are leaning forward more than you want to – this may strain your back and put more weight on your hands and arms than is comfortable. A small frame will also have a shorter top tube than a frame that fits you. To adjust the fit you will need to: 

I'm a little puzzled by the threads that look like they should draw the hub's axle back to tension the chain. They don't appear like they can move, but it also doesn't look like there is a nut on them to pull the axel back. Do you know if they thread into the frame, or are they free to slide? That said, it appears that the load on the mechanism would tend to misalign the threaded part where it passes through the frame. This is very likely to cause it to jam. I think you could try very gently prying up on the loop where the axle attaches or perhaps tapping down gently on the top of the loop. It shouldn't take much force at all. I'm assuming that the frame is not threaded and that the adjuster should slide freely. 

If the hub isn't built into a wheel and you have an arbor press, like the one below from Harbor Freight, I'd be inclined to use that if gentle tapping didn't do the job. They are relatively inexpensive (maybe $50-100 US for a new one) and generally useful if you like such things. When the wheel is assembled, a small arbor press won't be big enough to be useful. 

I found this Bikepacking Repair Kit on Pedaling Nowhere. I like the way it is broken down into components of a tool kit and spares collection. There is some good stuff in the comments section too. 

Just a thought… Run a bolt – maybe even a high strength bolt – backwards through the seatpost clamp and put a putty knife or the edge of a heavy washer between the halves of the clamp so that as you tighten the bolt it opens the seat tube. In a comment below, it was noted that in some seatpost clamps the threaded portion is an insert (i.e., it is not integral with the clamp) and would likely be pushed out by this method – so as you start tightening watch closely on the outboard side of the bolt, if you see paint cracking or any movement at all back off, you may have an insert and this idea won't work. Tighten the bolt a bit, add your favorite penetrating oil (I like Kroil), try twisting the seat post. Rinse (or not) and repeat.
