The day and night are not equal on the equinox, though they are about equal. Equinox is when the Earth's axis is not tilted towards the sun, or equivalently the path of the sun passes from the Northern to the Southern hemisphere. Sunrise and sunset are measured from the "top" of the sun, not the centre, and the refraction of the atmosphere means that the sun is visible from the surface, even after it would have set were there no air to bend its light. Finally the Earth's elliptical orbit also varies the length of the day. The day on which the day and night are equal varies with latitude. In Boston, at 42 degrees North (it's as far south as the French Riviera - always surprises me) the day is 12 hours long on Sept. 26. 

It is nit possible for a year to have 11 full moons. Even if there is a full moon on dec 31, there will still be 12 full moons in the subsequent year. It is possible for there to be a calendar month (February ) without a full moon. The next time this will happen, depending on your location, is 2018, as there will be no full moon during the month of February that year. Location is significant, as the start of February varies with timezone Using the Two full moons in a month definution of blue moon, 2018 will have a blue moon in both January and March., the march moon will also be the fourth full moon that season, 

You and your phone will be destroyed before you get to the black hole, but If we pretend that you and your phone can survive being in the vicinity of a black hole ... And let's suppose this is a regular black hole of about 5 to 10 solar masses, and you are falling in, you are not trying to orbit it. As you fall towards the black hole, at first there is no problem. As you get closer to the event horizon you will accelerate, but until the last second or so the relativistic effects are quite small. Your phone signal will be redshifted, so the receiver will have to adjust the frequency that they are listening in on. The last second before you fall in will last forever. Your signal will become redshifted further and further, your apparent rate of speaking will slow down and the last second before you pass the Event horizon will, to the outside observer, last forever. You however are doomed. You pass the Event horizon and reach the singularity in a fraction of a second. 

A supernova is the explosion, visible on Earth as a apparently new star that appears to brighten over a few days, and then fade. There have been no visible supernovae in our galaxy for several hundred years, and we are well overdue another one, though they are quite often visible in other galaxies. After the supernova there will be a remnant, a small nebula of hot gas that expands, eventually taking the form of a ring. In the centre of the remnant there may be neutron star or a black hole. A spinning neutron star may be a pulsar. Supernovae that occur when a old, giant star explodes at the end of its life can produce a neutron star or black hole. But some supernovae form when a white dwarf accumulates matter from another star onto its surface, and then explodes, in which case the star is completely destroyed. The term "nova" was previously used for all stellar explosions. However the term "nova" is nowadays limited to smaller explosions, caused by the fusion of hydrogen on white dwarf (but no sufficient build up of hydrogen to cause the white dwarf to be destroyed) 

As an undergraduate, you are a member of a university. Your first step then should be to talk to your Professors. As a guide to what might be expected, look at the University of Arizona telescope proposal page They accept proposals from members of Arizona University. You have to have a clear aim and plan. This is why you need to talk to your professors first. 

You are correct. The AT is short for Astronomical Transient. The follows the year and an arbitary sequence of letters to uniquely identify the event, which is assigned by the Transient Name Server This is the official IAU designation for Supernova Candidates, however true supernovae will be re-designated "SN YYYYX". The neutron star merger was not a supernova, so retains its AT designation This is described at (source) with more details at Transient Name Server (TNS) 

You are probably thinking of Miranda, a moon of Uranus. It is currently thought that the varied terrain (including the 10km high cliff called Verona Rupes) is more likely due to past geological activity driven by tidal heating, although a massive impact has not been completely discounted. The impact hypothesis was first suggested after the Voyager fly-by in 1986. 

That looks like a lens effect. Polaris is the brightest object and there is an internal reflection in the lens or the camera. It's a nice photo under difficult conditions. Can you see NGC 188, an odd open cluster? 

The original team suggested three main possibilities: "(1) unusual stellar activity, (2) emissions from other background objects, or (3) interference from satellite communications" Clearly radio astronomers know about satellites. They noted "in the absence of solid information about the signal, most astronomers would think that [radio interference or instrumental failures] would probably be the most likely explanation." The satellite hypothesis has some problems it "does not yet explain the strong dispersion-like features of the signals (diagonal lines in the [weird] figure [in the question])" But on a balance of probablities this is the most likely explanation. There are satellites in the region of Ross 128: 

There are a number of illustrations of this on the Stellar evolution page of wikipedia. Roughly a star begins as a large but cool ball of contracting gas, to the right of the main sequence until fusion starts in its core. Once fusion starts it has reached the main sequence. It gradually moves up as it slowly brightens during its life, and then moves to the right and up as it expands into a red giant. There are then some significant movements as heavier elements begin to fuse. Sun-like stars undergo a significant change when the helium fuses in a matter of days (or less according to some models), called the Helium flash. As this occurs, the star moves significantly down and left, back towards the main sequence, before expanding again into an even larger red giant. The expelling its outer layers in a planetary nebula, and rapidly moving to the left and down. Larger stars undergo other fluctuations, changing from red supergiants, to Luminous Blue Variables, and Wolf-Rayet stars, and ending in a supernova. There are several illustrations of this on the wikipedia page, but noting the sometimes significant differences between the diagrams suggests that this is a topic in which the details are not certain, in part due to the difficulty in getting observational evidence of changes in stars, which occur over very long time scales. 

There was no single designer of the Hubble telescope. It was designed and build by NASA, with contributions from the European Space Agency (ESA). The advantages of a telescope in space have been clear for over 100 years. These ideas were crystallized in Lyman Spitzer's 1946 paper. Spitzer continued to push for a telescope through the '50s and '60s. When Congress eventually funded the telescope in '78, the task of design was given to the Marshal Space Flight Center. The head of the space telescope project was Dr. Bob O'Dell, chair of the Astronomy dept. at the University of Chicago. In a video from NASA, Dr O'Dell talks about the early years of HST development. Over the years others have worked as Project Manager. There never was a single "inventor". Hundreds of scientists have been involved in its design and planning. Something as complex as the HST could never be designed by a solo inventor. 

Hear and smell: Nothing. The comet and its coma are well outside the atmosphere, no sound or scent can travel through space. The coma of the comet could be 30000km across, bigger than the moon, and the comet is half the distance to the moon, so the coma could appear about 20 times larger than the full moon. However, it would be very dim. Although its total brightness might be quite high, the surface brightness would be still very low. It is likely that only the central part of the coma would be visible, as a hazy blur, with no clearly defined edge. Some jets might be visible towards the nucleus. In a dark sky it would look quite dramatic. The nucleus would be only about 4 arcseconds across, however it is close enough to be visible as a star-like body in the centre of the fuzzy nucleus. Telescopes would reveal the shape of the body, but telescopes on Earth would show few details. The comet would slowly track across the sky, clearly moving relative to the stars if you observe it for any length of time. The exact speed would depend on its orbit, but it wouldn't be moving like a meteor, the encounter would take a few hours. The tail, which might be visible in dark sky locations, would be pointing away from the sun, rather than behind the direction of travel. 

All the planets in the solar system orbit the same way. This is not a coincidence. Planets all form from the same protoplanetary disc that surrounded the young sun. The particles in the disc orbited the same way as the sun rotates, and the planets continue to orbit in the same direction. In this context forward means orbiting in the same direction as the star rotates. We would expect most planets to orbit "forwards" for the same reason that all the planets in the solar system orbit forwards. What probably happened with HAT-P-7b is that it was thrown into an odd orbit following a close encounter with another planet, or perhaps another star. It is also conceivable that it is a captured rogue planet. See a New Scientist article about the planet 

If you look at the position of the sun at the same time each day, over the course of a year, you will find it traces a "figure of 8" pattern in the sky called an analemma. This may seem an extremely obscure thing to have a name, but it is important for sundial makers, and comes from sundial cant. Now this means that the time that the sun will cross the meridian will vary from day to day. At the equator, the sun will travel directly overhead only on the equinoxes. In June, the sun will be in the North at midday, In December it will be in the South. Each country is in a time-zone. It is a matter of convenience that the time in the country is all the same, rather than each location using their local solar time. At your location in Costa Rica you have found that solar noon occurs at 11:32. The Costa Rican's could choose to put their clocks forward an hour, but if they did, then local noon would be at 12:32. The effect of time-zones is most extreme in the far west of China, where Beijing time is in use. There, local noon occurs at about 15:00. China chooses to have a single time zone, in contrast to other large countries like the USA or Russia. 

Black holes are surrounded by magnetic fields, generated in the accretion disc of matter orbiting the blackhole. 

The metaphysical aspects of your question can't be answered. Our bodies aren't eternal, and astronomy can't answer questions about the soal. Observations of the universe suggest that it will continue expanding. As you note, eventually all the stars will run out of hydrogen, collapse to white dwarfs, which then slowly cool. What happens next is rather speculative. At this time there will be nowhere that is warm in the universe. Everywhere will cool to very close to absolute zero. Complex chemistry will no longer be possible, and there will be no life in the universe. Some stars will fall into black holes. Others will be ejected from the galaxy. If protons decay, then very very very slowly, the matter will break down, leaving only black holes. If black holes emit Hawking radiation, then they too will break down. In this model, the spacetime of the universe is eternal, but nothing within it survives. Wikipedia has a list of some of the events of the far future 

This would probably be a unique situation. Never in the era of the IAU has the existence of a space body been predicted prior to discovery. The standard rule is that priority in naming goes to the team that discovers an object. In the scenario you describe, discovery would mean locating the object and determining its orbit. The statistical evidence for a planet nine is interesting, but far from overwhelming, and the team cannot be said to have discovered a planet. However as this would be a unique situation, the IAU may choose to ignore its own protocols, and to consult more widely than normal, to seek a consensus among astronomers on the name. 

As answered by Wolframalpha, (as linked by chirlu) The distance between Tau Ceti and Epsilon Eridani is 5.45 light years. 

Supernovae hunters report finding about 1 supernova per 5000 images. Hunters will, naturally, focus on larger galaxies, as these are more likely to contain a supernova, whereas the deep field survey contains galaxies of all sizes, so perhaps about 1 supernova per 10000 galaxies imaged would be a reasonable estimate. Thus you might expect there to be about 1 supernova visible in this image, but as you note, if there is one, it may be too dim to be visible. Supernovae are all one pixel or less (they are so small and distant that they appear as point-like sources of light), they only appear to be bigger due to atmospheric blurring or imperfections in optics and/or electronics. 

Tidal locking occurs because the planet deforms the satellite into an oval, with long axis pointing towards the planet. If the satellite is rotating the long axis will move away from being pointing towards the planet, and the gravity of the planet will tend to pull it back, slowing the rotation until one face is permanently facing the planet. Tidal locking isn't a result of the formation processes, but a consequence of satellites not being perfectly rigid. In order to model the effects of tides on the orbits and rotation periods of satellites you need to know several important pieces of information. First you obviously need to know the size of the planet and the satellite (both in terms of mass and radius) the shape of the orbit and the rotation rate of both planet and satellite. For many objects, these values are well known. Next, and this is the tricky bit, you need to know how the satellite and planet will be deformed by the other's gravity, and how much tidal heating will occur. These are the so-called "love number" (after Augustus Love) and the dissipation function, Q. It is hard to estimate these. For the Earth Moon system the ratio k/Q is known to be 0.0011. (but the Earth is a poor model for other planets, which don't have a substantial ocean, or a liquid core) For other planets the value of Q varies between 10 and 10000, with larger values for the gas giants, and k can be estimated from the rigidity of the bodies. A simple gravitation model is not able to capture the subtleties of the gravitational interaction between two mutually deforming bodies, indeed for most simulations, the planets are modelled as points, or at most as spheres, and this is good enough for all but the highest precision calculations. Tidal locking takes a long time (by human standards) but a relatively short time compared with the age of the solar system. The time taken is very strongly dependent (order 6) on the radius of the orbit. Direct simulation would be more or less impossible: the deformations are too small, and the time scale of locking is too large. It would be possible (though difficult) to model tidal locking in a simulation with unrealistic values for the rigidity of the satellite, and the size of the planet (think jelly world, orbiting a (Newtonian) black hole) so the deformation is greater and the locking time shorter. However modelling the elastic deformation of a body under gravity is far from trivial. 

Converting answer in comment to community wiki Unlikely. Neptune is warmer than Uranus, more internal heat means more turbulent atmosphere. The reason why this is so isn't known, but it's possible that Uranus had a more turbulent past and it emitted heat from its formation more quickly. It's also possible that Neptune had a collision more recently that may have added to its internal heat. Triton is too small to have the effect you describe and the retrograde motion isn't a factor. 

Meteorites are rocks, and rocks are normally quite insoluble. When an insoluble body is mixed with water the pH of the water isn't changed.# Meteorites contain quite a lot of various metallic oxides, which are bases. This includes magnesium oxide which can dissolve a little, and is Alkali. The energy released by a large impact could also cause some nitrogen oxides to form from the atmosphere (which are acidic). However these are small effects. The pH of the water is little changed. The seas are big, and any effect is soon diluted.
