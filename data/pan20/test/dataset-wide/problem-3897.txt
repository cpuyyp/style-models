The first question is cool, but unfortunately the answer's boring: The limit in general will not exist. Counterexample: Consider the conic hypersurface $z=\lambda x^2+\mu y^2$. There are two symmetrical "1-parameter families of quadruples-of-points" for which the limit of the circumradius as $\epsilon\to 0$ is easy to calculate: $\{(0,0,0), (\epsilon,0,\lambda\epsilon^2),(-\epsilon,0,\lambda\epsilon^2),(0,\epsilon,\mu\epsilon^2)\}$ and $\{(0,0,0), (\epsilon,0,\lambda\epsilon^2),(0,\epsilon,\mu\epsilon^2),(0,-\epsilon,\mu\epsilon^2)\}$. For the first, the limit of the circumradius is $\frac{1}{2\lambda}$; for the second, it is $\frac{1}{2\mu}$. However, here's a weaker statement that is true: Fact: Let $\Sigma$ be a convex hypersurface of $\mathbb{R}^n$. Then $\frac{1}{\limsup}$ and $\frac{1}{\liminf}$ of the circumradius of an $(n+1)$-tuple of points, are the minimal and maximal [absolute-values-of-] principal curvatures respectively. 

This question has bugged me as I read McDuff-Salamon's book on pseudoholomorphic curves. I'll use their terminology. Let $\Sigma$ be a compact surface possibly with boundary, $M$ an almost-complex manifold, and $L$ a totally real submanifold of $M$. A map $u:(\Sigma, \partial\Sigma)\to(M, L)$ gives rise to a bundle pair over $\Sigma$: a complex vector bundle $u^*TM$ over $\Sigma$, together with a totally real sub-bundle $u^*TL$ over $\partial\Sigma$. Question: Is there a nice description for the Maslov index of this bundle pair, in terms of a topological invariant of $u$? For instance, in terms of the homology class $u_*[\Sigma]\in H_2(M, L)$, or in terms of the homotopy equivalence class of $u$? Motivating special case: if $\partial\Sigma=\emptyset$, then the Maslov index of the bundle pair $(u^*TM, \emptyset)$ is $2\langle c_1(TM), u_*[\Sigma]\rangle$. 

Is it (for some reason) true that $\lim_{c\to 0^+}\int_c^{\pi/2}\frac{c}{t}\sqrt\frac{1+t^2}{t^2-c^2}dt=\frac{\pi}{2}$? Numerical evidence (from Mathematica): 

(Ugh! The point is, getting the right definition is hard.) Then it is a theorem of Anderson, Anderson-Cheeger that upper and lower bounds on Ricci curvature imply the existence of $C^{1,\alpha}$ charts with uniform size $r$ and badness $\epsilon$. The proof is by taking harmonic co-ordinates. If you also have bounds on the derivatives of the Ricci tensor, then you get higher-order bounds on the metric tensor in the chart. 

But of course there are stronger metric properties of Riemannian manifolds that one might hope would carry over to their limits. One that I have been wondering about is the continuity (say in the compact-open topology EDIT (see below): some other topology) of the length functional. After a couple of days' thought I've decided I have absolutely no intuition for this. So, I'd be very glad to hear: 

Update: Everything I wrote before is fine, but here's a specific result, from Gilbarg-Trudinger Corollary 16.7 (2001 edition), as an idea of what's possible. Let $\Omega\subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$, and let $u:\Omega\to\mathbb{R}$. Let $H$ denote the mean curvature of the graph of $u$ (this graph is a hypersurface in $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$). Then for all $y\in\Omega$, $$|D^{k+1}u|_y|\leq C(n,k,\sup|H|,\ldots \sup |D^kH|,\operatorname{dist}(y,\partial\Omega),\sup|u|).$$ Old: I think you may wish to speak with a geometric measure theorist. A few remarks: 

As Francesco Polizzi remarks, the idea is to identify $\text{Sym}^2(\mathbb{P}^2)$ with a cubic hypersurface in $\mathbb{P}^5$. Frege's lecture (see link in comments) actually goes on to explain how this is done. The cubic hypersurface is (in the six variables $s_1,s_2,s_3,t_1,t_2,t_3$), $\text{det} \begin{pmatrix} s_1 & t_3 & t_2 \cr t_3 & s_2 & t_1 \cr t_2 & t_1 & s_3 \end{pmatrix}=0$ and the identification of $\text{Sym}^2(\mathbb{P}^2)$ with this hypersurface is $\{[x_1:x_2:x_3],[y_1:y_2:y_3]\}\mapsto [x_1y_1:x_2y_2:x_3y_3:\frac{1}{2}(x_2y_3+x_3y_2):\frac{1}{2}(x_3y_1+x_1y_3):\frac{1}{2}(x_1y_2+x_2y_1)]$. Quite possibly, someone more knowledgeable than me can motivate this! 

For a general $Y$, it will be matrix-exponential in $t$ with initial conditions determined by $Y$. Here's an explicit computation. Pick a left-invariant global frame $(E_1, \ldots E_n)$ for the group, and define structure constants $[E_i, E_j]=\sum c_{ij}{}^kE_k$. The covariant derivative of $E_i$ along the geodesic $\exp(tX)$ from 0 is the constant $\frac{1}{2}[X, E_i]=\frac{1}{2}\sum X^jc_{ji}{}^kE_k$ (see eg Lee "Riemannian Manifolds" problem 5-11). Therefore a vector field $t\mapsto \sum f^i(t)E_i$ along this geodesic is parallel if it is a solution to $0=D_t\left(\sum f^i(t)E_i\right)=\sum_k\left[(f^k)'(t)+\frac{1}{2}\sum_{i,j} f^i(t)X^jc_{ji}{}^k\right]E_k$, i.e., to $\forall k \ 0=(f^k)'(t)+\frac{1}{2}\sum_{i,j} f^i(t)X^jc_{ji}{}^k$. The parallel transport of $Y$ will be the solution to this linear system with initial value $Y$. Perhaps there's a nice basis-invariant way of expressing this? I can't think offhand. 

For a smooth function $f:M\to N$, it seems clear that, at least, all continuous functions homotopic to $f$ will be connected to it. This question is inspired by the discussion of $\mathcal{W}^{k,p}(M, N)$ in McDuff-Salamon's book on $J$-holomorphic curves. There it's stated as an offhand remark that the connected components of $\mathcal{W}^{k,p}(M, N)$ (in the case of $M$ oriented & two-dimensional; I'm not sure if this makes a difference) are the completions of the sets {$f:M\to N \text{ smooth}: f_*[M]=A$}, for $A\in H_{\dim M}(N)$. If the McD-S factoid is true, there should exist sequences of smooth not-all-mutually-homotopic functions which converge in $\mathcal{W}^{k,p}(M, N)$. (This isn't too counterintuitive, since $\mathcal{W}^{k,p}(M, N)$ presumably contains functions which aren't continuous, & so don't themselves have a homotopy class). Can someone give me an example of this phenomenon? 

It seems plausible to me that this would be true of complete connected Riemannian manifolds and that it would not be true of arbitrary length spaces. Is this so? And if so, is the set of length spaces which do have this property Gromov-Hausdorff closed? 

It sounds to me like you have heard, and are trying to remember the statement of, the following fact about the Hodge Laplacian $d^*d+dd^*$ on forms. Slogan: eigenforms come in pairs. Sketch proof: If $(d^*d+dd^*)\eta=-\lambda\eta$, then $(d^*d+dd^*)(d\eta)=dd^*d\eta=d(d^*d+dd^*)\eta=-\lambda d\eta$. Statement: Recall the Hodge decomposition $\Gamma(M,\Lambda^kM)=A_k\oplus B_k\oplus H_k=\operatorname{im}(d^*_{k+1})\oplus\operatorname{im}(d_{k-1})\oplus (\operatorname{ker}(d_k^*)\cap\operatorname{ker}(d_k))$, such that for all $k$, $d_k:A_k\to B_{k+1}$ is an isomorphism. Then for each $\lambda$, $d_k$ sends the $\lambda$-eigenspace of $A_k$ to the $\lambda$-eigenspace of $B_{k+1}$. Special case: Each nonzero eigenvalue of the Laplace operator on functions is also an eigenvalue of the Laplace operator on 1-forms. Also, if you take any sensible choice whatsoever of Laplacian on $\Gamma(M,\Lambda^kM)$, then the asymptotic distribution (à la Weyl) of the eigenvalues will be the same as the asymptotic distribution of the eigenvalues of the Laplacian on scalars (up to multiplication by the rank of $\Lambda^kM$). See, eg, Theorem 2.41 of Berline-Getzler-Vergne. 

This should be straightforward; I'm sorry if it's too much so. Can someone point me to a reference which computes the Dolbeault cohomology of the Hopf manifolds? Motivation: I'd like to work through a concrete example of the Hodge decomposition theorem failing for non-Kähler manifolds. The textbook I have handy (Griffiths & Harris) doesn't treat this, and the obvious Google search was unhelpful. 

The answer to (a) is easier than you think. As you remark, Aubin shows the estimate holds near the diagonal, so for some $\epsilon$, for all $P$, $Q$ with $\rho(P,Q)<\epsilon$, $G(P,Q) \leq k \rho(P,Q)^{2-n}.$ However, since the manifold is compact, the continuous function $G$ is bounded (say, by the real number $A$) on the complement of this epsilon-neighbourhood of the diagonal. Thus for all $P$, $Q$ $G(P,Q) \leq max(k, A \rho(P,Q)^{n-2})\rho(P,Q)^{2-n}\leq \max(k, A \ diam(M)^{n-2})\rho(P,Q)^{2-n}$. 

Example. If $M$ is a Riemann surface and $E$ a holomorphic line bundle over it, the kernel of the delbar operator $\overline{\partial}:E\to T^{0,1}M\otimes E$ is precisely the holomorphic sections of $E$. By complex analysis, zeroes of holomorphic functions have positive degree. Theorem 1 then yields the standard result that if a line bundle admits a global holomorphic section then its Euler class (aka first Chern class) is nonnegative. 

I often hear mention of two theorems, Mostow's rigidity theorem and Liouville's theorem on conformal mappings, which superficially sound similar: they say that a set of geometric structures is, if nonempty, big in dimension 2, but small in dimension greater than 2. (For Mostow's theorem, the set of structures in question is the set of hyperbolic metrics on a manifold; for Liouville's, it's the set of germs of flat metrics in a conformal equivalence class.) I know that hyperbolic and conformal geometry are closely connected, at least in dimension 2. I'm curious as to whether this analogy is hinting at one such connection. Is there a "good reason" for this analogy? 

There is an interesting trick used in Chen-LeBrun-Weber's paper on the extremal Kähler metrics of $\mathbb{CP}^2\#2\overline{\mathbb{CP}^2}$, and I would like to know whether it can be (has been?) exploited further. The trick applies to certain Kähler classes $\mathfrak{k}$ of a complex manifold $M$, and allows one to give upper and lower bounds for the scalar curvature of an extremal Kähler metric in $\mathfrak{k}$, if such a metric exists. This is important later in the paper -- in dimension 2 it allows one to control the Sobolev constant of such a metric, and thus to control the degenerations of sequences of such metrics. The trick appears at the end of Section 3. I will describe it in a more general setting than Chen-LeBrun-Weber's (hopefully not making any mistakes in this generalization). Let $M$ be a complex manifold, fix a maximal connected compact subgroup $K$ of the group of automorphisms of $M$, and let $\mathfrak{k}$ be a Kähler class of $M$. According to Futaki-Mabuchi there is a canonically determined holomorphic vector field $\Xi_\mathfrak{k}$ which is the extremal Kähler vector field of a $K$-invariant extremal Kähler metric $\omega\in\mathfrak{k}$, if any exists. Suppose that $\mathfrak{k}$ satisifes Important Property. The holomorphic vector field $\Xi_\mathfrak{k}$ generates a closed 1-parameter subgroup ($\cong S^1$) of automorphisms of $M$. (Remark: in Chen-LeBrun-Weber's setting, all bilaterally symmetric Kähler classes of $\mathbb{CP}^2\#2\overline{\mathbb{CP}^2}$ have this property.) Then the range (max minus min) of the scalar curvature of $\omega$ is equal to $\lambda \ \mathfrak{k}\cdot [F]/4\pi$, where $F$ is a rational curve in $M$ which is the closure of a ``generic'' orbit of the group ($\cong\mathbb{C}^*$) of automorphisms generated by $\Xi_\mathfrak{k}$ and its complexification, and where the real number $\lambda$ is such that $\lambda^{-1}\Xi_\mathfrak{k}$ is the standard generator of the $S^1$. Since the average of the scalar curvature of $\omega$ is cohomologically determined by $\mathfrak{k}$, this then gives upper and lower bounds on the scalar curvature of $\omega$. Here are my questions (assuming that my slight generalization of Chen-LeBrun-Weber's statement is correct). 

Is the length functional of a complete connected Riemannian manifold indeed continuous? (Proof in some special cases: if $\Gamma:[0,1]\times (-\epsilon,\epsilon)\to M$ is continuously differentiable, then $$ \lim_{t\to 0}\int_0^1|\frac{\partial\Gamma}{\partial s}(s,t)|ds = \int_0^1|\frac{\partial\Gamma}{\partial s}(s,0)|ds $$ by limit-swapping.) Is a Gromov-Hausdorff limit of complete-length-spaces-with-continuous-length-functional also a complete-length-space-with-continuous-length-functional? 

By a 1990 paper of Michael Anderson, the following is true: Theorem. Let the metric space $(X,d,p)$ be a pointed Gromov-Hausdorff limit of a sequence of complete pointed Riemannian manifolds $(M_i,g_i, p_i)$ satisfying the uniform bounds 

As far as I can tell, a major motivation for the study of length spaces is that they arise as Gromov-Hausdorff limits of Riemannian manifolds. Specifically, 

Let $(X_\alpha, \mathcal{L}_\alpha)_{\alpha\in A}=(M, L, J_\alpha, \overline{\partial}_\alpha)_{\alpha\in A}$ be a family of polarized varieties, with $A$ the complex manifold parametrizing the family (assumed to be connected). Here is $M$ the common underlying smooth manifold of the varieties $X_\alpha$, $J_\alpha$ are the integrable almost-complex structures corresponding to the different varieties $X_\alpha$, $L$ is the common underlying smooth complex line bundle of the $J_\alpha$-holomorphic line bundles $\mathcal{L}_\alpha$, and $\overline{\partial}_{\alpha}$ are the integrable delbar-operators on $L$ corresponding to the different holomorphic line bundles $\mathcal{L}_\alpha$. Lemma: For each $\alpha_0\in A$, there is a neighbourhood $U\subseteq A$ of $\alpha_0$, and a smoothly varying family $(\omega_\alpha)_{\alpha\in U}$ of symplectic forms in $c_1(L)$, such that for each $\alpha$, the form $\omega_\alpha$ is $J_\alpha$-Kähler. Sketch proof: For each $\alpha$ we have a map $$F_\alpha: \{\text{hermitian metrics on $L$}\}\to \{\text{real 2-forms in $c_1(L)$}\}$$ given by sending a hermitian metric on $L$ to $-i$ times the curvature of its $(J_\alpha,\overline{\partial}_\alpha)$-Chern connection. The maps $F_\alpha$ vary smoothly with $\alpha$. If $\omega_0$ is a $J_{\alpha_0}$-Kähler form, there is some hermitian metric $h$ on $L$ such that $F_{\alpha_0}(h)=\omega_0$. For $\alpha$ sufficiently close to $\alpha_0$, the $J_\alpha-(1,1)$-form $\omega_\alpha:=F_\alpha(h)$ is also nondegenerate, and so is $J_\alpha$-Kähler. $\square$ It follows that the space of 2-forms in $c_1(L)\in H^2(M,\mathbb{Z})$ which are Kähler for some $J_\alpha$ is connected. By the Moser trick, all these 2-forms are isotopic to each other. This answers your first question. It also follows that one can smoothly select elements $(\omega_\alpha)_{\alpha\in a}$ of $c_1(L)\in H^2(M,\mathbb{Z})$, which are respectively $J_\alpha$-Kähler. Edit: For the second question, I had previously proposed the pullback $\pi_1^*\omega_\alpha+\pi_2^*\widetilde\omega$ as a potential symplectic form on $M\times A$, where $\widetilde\omega$ is some symplectic form on $A$. But, now that I think about it, this pullback is not necessarily closed. On the other hand, by the arguments for the first question, we can select smoothly varying diffeomorphisms $\psi:A\to\operatorname{Diff}(M)$ such that for all $\alpha$, $\psi_\alpha^*\omega_\alpha=\omega_{\alpha_0}$. (Maybe this requires simple connectedness of $A$?) Write $\Psi:M\times A\to M\times A$ for the induced diffeomorphism $\Psi(x,\alpha)=(\psi_\alpha(x),\alpha)$. Then $(\Psi^{-1})^*(\pi_1^*\omega_{\alpha_0}+\pi_2^*\widetilde\omega)$ is a symplectic form which restricts on $\alpha$-slices to $\omega_\alpha$, which should answer the second question. I had also mentioned some general references on moduli spaces of Fano varieties (because of the issue of finding a symplectic form $\widetilde\omega$ on $A$), which I will preserve: 1, 2.
