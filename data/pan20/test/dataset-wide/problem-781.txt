There are two separate issues when you talk about a star's age. Are you talking about its absolute age, in years, or its age in terms of how far along is it within its own evolution? The difference is, massive stars go through their evolutionary phases very quickly, and low-mass stars very slowly, so essentially all very low-mass stars are older in years than essentially every very high-mass star. Also, you can know more than the "spectral type" from a spectrum, you can also know the "luminosity class"-- that's the roman numeral that tells you if the star is, for example, a main-sequence dwarf or not. So if you pick an M spectral type main-sequence star, and an O spectral type main-sequence star, as two stars at random, it is extremely likely that the M star is much older than the O star, and you can know that purely from the spectral type and luminosity class. But if you want to know the age of the M star, or the O star, in years within their evolutionary stages, then it gets more difficult because there is rather little main-sequence evolution in the spectrum. There is some evolution though, especially late in the main sequence, so you could tell its age if there is evidence of main-sequence evolution in the spectrum (for one thing, the luminosity rises with age, within a spectral type, but that's pretty hard to tell from the spectrum). If the star is both low-mass and early in its main-sequence evolution, the best way to tell its age is to look at the rotational broadening of its lines, as low-mass stars spin down rapidly as they age (due to strong magnetic fields and weak winds). Another good way to tell the age of stars is if they are in clusters that all formed together, you can look at what is called the "main sequence turnoff", which basically means you look for the lowest mass star that has gone supernova, and you know how long that takes for that mass of star. You tell this from the spectrum because the turnoff is in the "Hertsprung-Russell" diagram, which you make from the spectra, but it requires a lot of stars in the cluster, so it's not really a property of a single spectrum. So the bottom line is, you need a suite of different techniques for assessing the ages of stars, it is not always easy or straightforward but you can take each case individually and look for ways to infer age. Much easier is determining which evolutionary class a star is in, because stars change dramatically in one phase or another, and the spectrum alone can tell you if you have a dwarf or a giant, etc. (Basically, the lines get much narrower as a star puffs out in radius, because the pressure drops.) 

Of course it is not exactly known how big the universe is, but I thougt that the universe is about 100 billion lightyears in diameter. But if that is true can you also make an estimation of the volume of the universe? 

During a solar eclipse sir Eddington measured the declination of star light by the Sun. Einstein predicted a declination of 1.74 arc seconds, but according to Newton the declination should have been 0.86 arc seconds. So is it a coincidence that the prediction of Einstein is twice as large or is there a kind of law involved which makes Einsteins outcomes of his GR twice as big as according to Newton? 

Every object in the universe--from a basic star to an exotic black hole--spins, and the origin of that spin can be traced back to the very beginning of time. Within instants after the Big Bang, the primordial fireball of energy expanded at an incredible speed, then later cooled and solidified into all the matter in the universe. Had this fireball been uniform in all directions, everything we see today would be completely homogeneous. $URL$ 

It depends on what you mean by "in the center" or "switch places." If you physically moved the Earth to where the Sun is, and the Sun to where the Earth is, and gave each the speed that the other had while keeping the same reference frame, this would do tremendous violence to all the other planets in the solar system (though the Earth would continue to orbit more or less the same). However, if what you are talking about is simply the language of what you call the center, then you are talking about changing to a different set of coordinates where the Earth is at the stationary center of your coordinate system. Doing that presents no problems, and nothing is different except the language you are using to talk about what is going on. One of the great things Einstein did was to reframe the laws of physics in a form that was independent of coordinates, allowing us to forever separate what the laws say is happening from the language we use to talk about what is happening (i.e., our chosen coordinates). So it all comes down to whether you think "being in the center" is a real thing, or just the language of some coordinate system. If the former, then no, things would not be at all the same, if the latter, then yes, they'd be exactly the same, if you are careful to use coordinate-independent laws like general relativity. 

When galaxies move away from us (caused by the expanding spacetime) their light seems to show a redshift. But what is really needed for this? What time lap is for example needed to see a difference in frequency, and how does this precisely work? Is this also possible for gravitational waves, or are amplitudes the only solution to derive the redshift from? 

A star emits energy through the fusion of hydrogen to helium in the core through the proton proton cycle or the carbon nitrogen cycle. Over time, hydrogen in the core is increasingly burned, which causes the fusion process to decrease over time. As a result, the star cools down and decreases the radiation pressure in the core. As a result, the core draws a little more together under the influence of its own weight, which increases the temperature. This temperature rise leads to a hydrogen fusion in a shell outside the core. But how is the temperature increased as the radiation pressure is decreased? Is this increase caused by conduction or convection or....? 

The idea must have to do with tidal locking of Venus' rotation with its orbit. That also happened to Mercury, except that Mercury has maintained its elliptical orbit so it actually switches the face toward the Sun each time it passes perihelion. Venus' orbit is circular (probably because of the stronger tidal deformations of its malleable atmosphere), so tidal bulges on its atmosphere would tend to slow the rotation to match the orbital period and keep the same side facing the Sun. That goes a long way toward stopping the rotation, though what reverses it a little must be something else, a final step that has to do with the mantle rotating differently from the atmosphere. That last bit must be complicated. 

The mass of a planet does not affect its orbit significantly unless it is a very large planet. On the opposite end of the spectrum would be a very small mass planet that was evaporating, and that is essentially what a comet is. It's all Keplerian, though comets can have their orbits affected slightly by the tiny push they get from the evaporating gases. So it's not the change in mass, but how the evaporation actually happens, but this is a small effect. Even a large planet like Jupiter does not affect the Sun much (the Sun orbits around a point that is not even external to the Sun), so losing mass would not affect the orbit of Jupiter in any significant way either. 

One of the most massive Supermassive Black Hole observed is the one at the centre of the galaxy NGC1600 with a mass of 17 billion suns. It would have a density of âˆ¼0.01kg/m^3, or one part in 100,000 times the density of water, or 1% the density of earth atmosphere at sea level. But if there is so much gas why isn't the bh shrinking and becoming more dense as gravity would pull everything together? 

In the GR Einstein's interpretation was in terms of a deformation of the geometry of the space ending in a curvature of spacetime. I've thought that mass could do this by interacting with other mass and causes gravitational waves which makes the space curved. But a prof told me that this isn't the case. For example the gravitational waves caused between the earth and the sun is just a very tiny effect which causes spiraling earth to the sun which is of little effect. So mass is establishing the geometry of the space and the time. But the question remains how is mass doing that (curving spacetime)? 

It would take the same 8 minutes for the Earth's orbit to change as it does for us to stop receiving light from the Sun. No signal travels faster than light. 

If you imagine all three stars have similar mass, which would be a normal thing to assume as a first approximation, and assuming the incident speed is larger than the orbital velocity (it likely would be, because it is getting pulled in), then the interaction would seem to be likely to happen with one of the stars in the binary, moreso than the other. So for a short time, those two stars would behave like two objects undergoing "Rutherford scattering." It would indeed depend sensitively on the details (especially the incident angle), but it does seem pretty likely to me that it would disrupt the initial binary. It's possible that the interloping star could even grab one of the stars into a binary with itself, leaving the other one behind, but if the star comes in fast, it seems pretty likely that the original binary will at the very least be made highly eccentric, and quite likely disrupted altogether. But yes, there's no substitute for an orbital simulation. Now, it occurs to me you might be imagining the third star comes in along the axis of the original binary. In that special case, the incident star would have no effect at all if the original binary had two equal mass stars in a circular orbit-- it would simply speed up the whole initial binary toward it, and then return it to its original movement after it passes. But it wouldn't leave the stars moving-- it would erase its effect as it leaves, and all that would linger is an overall shift in the location of the barycenter. But it's a very special case there. 

I don't know how common it is for a system to have two stars (or perhaps even more) but how do they arise? Is that due to the stellar accretion disc, or the composition of the stellar nebula? Or are most of them created by a collision of stars? 

Within a few billion years our Sun would become a red giant and destroying Mercury and Venus and perhaps even the Earth. But nevertheless our solar system still have some planets like Jupiter and Neptune orbitting around the sun, because his mass wouldn't be very different. After another while our Sun would turn into a white dwarf. Probably his mass changed a bit, but would it be enough to lose for example Neptune? If not, is there a prediction at what time, if ever, our 'sun' will lose (some of) his planets for the first time? 

There are as far as I know two fusion reactions by which stars convert hydrogen to helium: The CNO cycle (for carbonâ€“nitrogenâ€“oxygen) and the protonâ€“proton chain reaction. The elements created in the CNO cycle are C,N,O and Fluor. But in this video min:13:00 $URL$ the prof. talks about Phosphorus and sulfur. Is that true and are those element also created in the CNO cycle or is he talking about something else? 

There is a lot of additional information you would need to get a mass-loss rate. What you have is a detection of some dust mass, and a time interval over which that mass was lost, so you could get something that looks like a mass-loss rate by taking the mass and dividing by the time over which it was lost, so 0.1 M_sun divided by 26,000 years. That's already a mass-loss rate of .0004 M_sun/year, which is quite high, but there are several problems that could lead to this being either an overestimate or an underestimate: 1) You presumably want an average mass-loss rate over very long time intervals, not just 26,000 years. So you need to know if this represents a steady process, or a kind of special event. Stars related to Wolf-Rayet stars, called "luminous blue variables," are often observed to lose mass in discrete episodes that happen an unpredictable intervals. So is the dust surrounding your star a typical feature that should be expected to always be there, or was the star selected because it has such a feature? If the latter, then the 26,000 year timescale is not a characteristic time for that object. A related issue is that 60 km/s is a very slow speed for a Wolf-Rayet wind, so that also suggests you had some kind of mass release incident when the star was very puffed out, not a more steady kind of wind. 2) An even worse problem is that all you know about is the mass in dust. That is probably only a small fraction of the total mass lost, because depending on the evolutionary state of the Wolf-Rayet star, there could be a lot of hydrogen, and very likely a lot of helium, that do not participate in dust-making. Also, the reason dust is not detected inside 10000 AU could be that the dust hasn't formed yet when it is so close to the ionizing radiation from the Wolf-Rayet star. If so, you cannot even use the dust mass to characterize the mass of the material that does form dust, without also knowing the fraction that has made dust at each particular radius. 3) Also, if the outer radius of the feature is at 60000 AU, and the feature has taken 26,000 years to form, then the average speed of the outer edge of the feature is the ratio of those numbers, yielding 2.3 AU/year. That translates into 11 km/s. So if the dust is moving at 60 km/s, but the outer edge of the feature is only moving at 11 km/s, that means the wind is piling into material in the interstellar medium. So it's not at all clear that the dust mass you are seeing is all from the Wolf-Rayet wind, some of it could be forming out of gas that was previously in the interstellar medium because something like 5/6 of the gas mass in that feature will have to have come from the interstellar medium. The Wolf-Rayet wind will be enriched in dust-forming material, but if it's only 5 times more so enriched, there will still be dust coming from the ISM. So that also depends on the evolutionary state of the Wolf-Rayet star. (The fact that you see so much dust suggests that this might be a "WC" type star, which are very enriched in carbon, so this last issue might not be a concern.) So it would take some more thinking and more research on the object, with additional quantitative constraints, to get a longer term mass-loss rate estimate. But at least you have .0004 M_sun/yr as a kind of benchmark to begin that conversation. 

Of course scientists assume there would also be exoplanets in other galaxies besides our own Milkyway. Is it true that our telescopes are not good enough to see planets in other galaxies, nor by brightness changes of the stars nor by inclination changes of stars. If so could the total mass of those galaxies be an indication of the presence of exoplanets, or is dark matter a problem for that? 

I'm a right that the difference is that precession indicates the direction of the inclination of the Earth'axis and the tilt is the quantity of this inclination? So that when there is no tilt there can't be any precession? And are the inclination degrees of the precession and the tilt related or the same? It seems that the precession causes different possible polarstar, but is the tilt also have effect on this? Perhaps this above it not right, so what else is the difference? Is perhaps the precession just the changing of the tilt? 

So is the effect between the passing planets different whether they encounter in the same or opposite direction in their orbits with the same relative speed difference?
