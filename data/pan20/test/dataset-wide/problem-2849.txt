Probably the best complete translation of Plato is : J. Cooper and D.S. Hutchinson (edd.), Plato: Complete Works. Indianapolis: Hackett Publishing Company, 1997. Pp. xxx + 1848. This is better - slightly more scholarly and definitely more up to date - than : E. Hamilton and H. Cairns (edd.), Plato : The Complete Dialogues, New Jersey : Princeton University Press, 1961. On the Timaeus : Plato, Timaeus by H. D. P. Lee (1966) - Penguin - is pretty reliable. A good and more recent translation is : Plato’s Timaeus. Translated by Peter Kalkavage. (Focus Philosophical Library.). Newburyport, Mass.: Focus Publishing, 2001. I also endorse Zeyl. As to page numbers, all editions of Plato use the Stephanus pagination - e.g. 26b. So whatever translation you use will easy cross-reference to any other. You would do well to avoid the much earlier work of AE Taylor. He was a notable scholar but in this area inclined to eccentric views. 

The agent has a reason for operating the pump, i.e. to replenish the water supply. No more than that. He has no intention of poisoning the household and poisoning the household was not his reason for operating the pump. Yet his action causes the household to be poisoned. In this case reason and cause are not identical. ▻ CRITIQUE (1) Yet this doesn't show that reasons cannot be causes and are not causes. The agent's desire to replenish the water supply was his reason to operate the pump; and that desire - that reason - caused him to operate the pump. All that the example Mucciolo presents does is to show, what no-one will dispute, that an action can have unintended consequences - that one's reasons can cause actions that produce consequences that one didn't intend and that did not inform one's reason for acting. ▻ CRITIQUE (2) Suppose my room is cluttered to the point where I cannot effectively work in it. I believe I can sort out the chaos and want to do so. My belief and want motivate me; I intend to tidy room. My reason for tidying is that I want to work effectively in the room. I set to, put books in order, tidy papers, throw out old bills and receipts. In a short while the room is tidy. We can say that my wanting to work effectively in the room is, or was, my reason for tidying it. This is a perfectly sound reason-based explanation. But it also fits all the conditions for a causal explanation. In a causal explanation (to keep to a simple case) : 

One can be altruistic, other-regarding in one's behaviour, to the point where one seriously damages one's own interests and prevents oneself thereby from helping others in future. Excessive altruism is altruism which impairs or destroys one's capacity for future altruism. There is no guarantee that altruism, merely as other-regarding, other-benefiting, behaviour will improve the allocation of resources. Altruism, heedlessly and undiscriminatingly pursued, may diminish social utility and leave the group or community worse off. 

▻ GOD, NATURE AND EVIL It is not possible within Spinoza's system for God or Nature to be evil or the cause of evil. To think otherwise is falsely to anthropomorphise God and Nature. Joel I. Friedman makes this helpfully clear : 

Given his background as a classical scholar, any direct with the Stoics is more likely to run through the Nietzschw than through the other writers you mention. But there is something in Kierkegaard : KIERKEGAARD AND THE STOICS 

Shift perspective for a moment. If God is perfect then it is logically impossible for God to create anything except imperfect beings. If God creates a perfect being then God can only reproduce Godself - another being equal in perfection to God. If perfection involves omnipotence, then we should have two omnipotent beings : and this is logically impossible. God can't be all-powerful - which at least means supremely powerful - if something else, which God has created, is equally powerful. God would have destroyed God's own supremacy, which would make God no longer imperfect. So either God creates nothing at all or God does create but what God creates is of logical necesssity imperfect. 

Morality is perfectly possible in a 'subjective idealistic reality' if subjective idealism is the view that all that exists is the - a single - knowing or experiencing subject. Morality is commonly taken to be interpersonal but it can be and is intrapersonal as well. If I exist as the only knowing or experiencing subject, I can still have duties to myself - Kant's Pflicht genen sich (selbst). Not that the point depends on Kant who in any case was not a subjective idealist. But I could as the only knowing or experiencing subject recognise a duty not to deceive myself about my own states of mind or emotions and in general acknowledge a duty, a self-imposed one, to maximise my capacities for self-knowledge - a duty of self-improvement. In brief, whenever there is on the common understanding of morality a duty to oneself, one could still have that duty as the only knowing or experiencing subject. Against the objection that the notion of 'duties to oneself' does not make sense, all the above claims can be re-stated in the language of moral self-improvement. Again, someone might argue that to think in moral terms one needs a public language, which a sole knowing or experiencing subject could not have. But insofar as this resonse depends on Wittgenstein's anti-private language argument the objection is only as strong or as weak as that less than decisive if ingenious argument. Someone again might argue that self-consciousness, which my argument assumes, depends on interpersonal experience. Self needs non-self or other self for the idea of one's own self to be possible. But this is no decisive objection : the 'Self needs non-self or other self' argument is precisely that - an argument to be assessed, not a philosophical datum. 

'If X then Y' as you introduce it is a logical relationship without reference to time. I might say, 'If X (this is a triangle) then Y (this has three sides and three internal angles)'. There is no notion here that something's being a triangle causes it to have three sides and three internal angles. The relationship is, if anything, purely definitional. In programming logic, I assume 'If X then Y' is an instruction for the program to do Y in condition X. There are accounts of causation, such as Aristotle's theory of the four causes, which are not strictly or purely temporal : the material cause, the formal cause, the efficient cause are in time but the final cause (to ou heneka, to telos) is not. See e.g. Aristotle, 'Physics', II.3, 194b and 'Metaphysics', II (a), 994b. Also in Plato's 'Phaedo' the Forms, transcendent of space and time, are recognised as causes ('Phaedo', 105b-c). The standard idea of causation is that a cause precedes, is temporally prior, to its effect. But (a) if heating water to 100C causes it to boil, doesn't it boil at the instant (not after) it reaches 100C ? However, this doesn't exclude temporality from causation, it just allows the cause not to precede the effect. Also (b) there is the possibility of backwards causation. This also doesn't exclude temporality; it simply allows the future or present to influence (not necessarily to create de novo) a past event or state of affairs. Conclusion : (i) your opening ''If X then Y' is logical, not causal; (ii) causes can be simultaneous with their effects not necessarily prior to them. (iii) the time order can be reversed in backwards causation. (ii) and (iii) preserve the temporality of causation. But Plato and Aristotle operate with ideas of causation in which a temporal dimension is excluded - Plato's Forms are non-temporal, transcendent of space and time, and Aristotle's four causes includes a non-temporal element in the final cause.
