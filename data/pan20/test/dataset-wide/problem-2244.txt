I'm planning to go downhill skiing next week and I notice the forecast for the day in question is for winds of 50 to 60 km/h. That seemed high to me. A few years ago, at the same hill, we were turned away when they closed all chair lifts because of strong winds, but how strong I don't know. Are there any standard guidelines that ski hills follow regarding maximum allowable wind strengths, before they close the lifts? I've seen a couple of anecdotal claims that chair lifts remained open (on other hills) even in 40 mph (64 km/h) winds. Seems awfully high. 

You did not say whether you were going downhill skiing or cross-country. The difference is significant: When downhill skiing you are being carried uphill each time between runs and so are not generating much of your own heat and so are not going to sweat much. You are also never very far from warm shelter where, if you feel cold, you can usually (a) consume hot food and drink and (b) blow hot air into your (temporarily empty) gloves and boots. Thus, so long as you have enough clothing to keep you warm, it needn't be "thermal". In fact, it is even safe to wear (the dreaded) cotton next to your skin. I do. When cross-country skiing -- or snow-shoeing or winter hiking -- you must propel yourself up every hill and doing so can generate much heat and cause sweating or giving off moist air. Because you are going to be relatively far from shelter, it is critical that you have "thermal" underwear and breathable outer shell that helps keep you warm and dry. Synthetics or merano wool will do. 

Another way, similar to the mesh bag that iontomet suggested, is the Maxpedition Roly Poly bag. It is a bag the rolls into a very small space, has MOLLE attachments for connecting to bags or belts, and can open up and hold just about anything. They come in a bunch of sizes including my favorite that will hold two big mallards easily. 

You have no idea how much time you have before you might take an impact, no matter how far above you the call is made because you don't know the delay in calling ROCK. Therefore, I think the answer is always the same, look straight at the rock face so your helmet is pointing up towards the object and hopefully takes the fall. Suck yourself in as close to the rock as you can as long as that is improving your overall stability in the position. Close your eyes so no sand gets blown in them. Count to 10 after you hear the last thing pass you before you move or open your eyes. I wouldn't do anything like change a hand or foothold because you probably don't have time. If you were doing something while the call is made, like a huge dynamic move, I would get secure as quick as possible, but optimizing for time rather than security. What not to do: look up to see what is falling at you. I haven't climbed in over two decades, so there may be updated advice, but that is what I learned and did. (assuming rock, not ice. I have no idea on ice) 

The problem you describe is known in surveying as three point resection â€“ essentially you need to observe angles, from an unknown point, between three points whose coordinates are known. Ideally, you observe the angles via a theodolite (transit). Failing that, a sextant. Failing that, a compass, as you state in the question. The means of solution is known as the Tienstra method. An interactive web solution is provided here. The mathematics are explained here. Note, the solution is impossible, or very poor, if all four points lie on, or close to, a circle. If your initial statement about the compass having systematic error is incorrect, i.e., that the observed magnetic bearings are actually good, then you only need to observe to two known locations. After correcting for magnetic declination you can simply plot the bearings on a map and see where they intersect. 

I have a couple of recurve bows that my brother and I had when we were kids. My kids are just starting to use them now, but the rabbit fur that my dad glued to the risers to use as arrow rests fell apart immediately when we started shooting them after 30 years of non-use. I would like to replace the rests as close to the way my dad had it rigged as possible. What is the best way to cure a small section of rabbit fur? I would rather not go buy any tanning supplies for such a small project if possible. I am also mostly interested in restoring the bows to the way I remember them, not finding the best arrow rest possible. 

I have had good luck taking a shotgun in hand and then picking out a spot at a typical bird type height and distance, often where the ceiling meets the wall in a corner. Then I stare at the spot, and mount the shotgun. Without moving, I shift my focus to the bead and see how close the bead is to my intended target. You can do a similar process by closing your eyes and mounting the shotgun. Open your eyes and see where you are looking first, then check how close the shotgun is in alignment to where you are looking. If you do this procedure with one shotgun, you can't tell much, but if you do it with two or three, you will find that one is probably coming up very well aligned and one is coming up way off. I have shot the guns that come up naturally much better than I have guns that don't. I also am primarily hunting live birds, so every shot is from an unmounted start. If you are just doing trap or skeet where you can set your mount very deliberately, this technique might not tell you as much. As a note, once I buy a new shotgun, I use this same drill over and over again to practice the mount and disengaging the safety. I often say the word "Bang" instead of pulling the trigger, then I check the bead alignment visually. This really helps me dial in and get the gun pointing how I want it. 

While the purists may bemoan this, they can be a good resource for identifying challenging parts, highlights or becoming familiar with a route. As always, StreetView is never as good as actually being there. 

NB. I am presuming that you walk the Kepler Track in the summer open season, not the winter season. Winter season is a different story and not for inexperienced trampers. 

I have seen walkers (trampers in NZ) often ask rangers how to keep their feet dry in the rain. Every ranger I have seen answer that has responded with "Unfortunately, you can't". But, there is good news. 

Walking with wet feet is not so bad. Your feet warm any water and so you get kind of a squishy, wetsuit effect. I have walked whole days with wet shoes, which is fine as long as I have a plan to dry my feet at day end. Walking the Kepler track (and most other trails in the region), there will almost certainly be a warm, dry hut at the end of the day. Plan on getting footwear that you can dry quickly i.e. a removable sole. Take plenty of dry socks. Dry feet in nice clean dry socks at the end of a long rainy day are wonderful!
