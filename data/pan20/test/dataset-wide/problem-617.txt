If the saddle is too high and the handle bars are not positioned appropriately, you may be exerting a fair amount of weight on your hands. Check if the handle bars are centered. Check if you are sitting properly centered on the saddle, slight lean can cause uneven distribution of weight at your hands. Are you left handed and use computer mouse often? Above mentioned are the things I would check. In any case, don't neglect it. I would strongly recommend that you consult a doctor. 

Another cause for the noisy brakes is the brake pads not being fully tightened. In my experience such noise is more commonly seen in cantilever brakes whose mechanism is well explained by Jay Bazuzi's response. 

A good safe biking distance is the distance that one can enjoy the bike ride to work, get there a few minutes early to clean up or shower and after work enjoy another bike ride home and still spare some time to spend with family/ loved ones/have a life besides work and the commute. I limit my bike commute to about an hour each way. 

Most of the bicycle chains are made using some form of steel/steel alloy. Nickel is an essential element in forming stainless steel, the reason to add Nickel is to retain the austenitic structure(a type of crystalline structure) for wide range of temperatures. Stainless steel has the appearance of a nickel-plated chain, but will still retain the look when old and used(kept clean of course). Unlike steel; the nickel-plated chain's plating may get worn off due to use and appear as though paint has chipped away. You may also see some chains that have special electro-plating of chromium/nickel, a.k.a dripping chrome trying to be aesthetic. Nickel plating on metal is known to provide corrosion resistance and has lubricant effect. 

I am looking for a solution where I can wear normal shoes/sandals/boots that is weather-appropriate when I am commuting to work. I think a vast majority of cyclists use regular flat pedals/ flat pedals with toe cages. Is there a trick/tip to align both feet properly on pedals or should I give up hope on being able to wear non-cleated shoes and go back to clip-in spd pedals? Or do I just need more practice with flat pedals? Are there other riders who have this problem? I did ride a mountain bike with flat pedals during my high school days but never thought about foot alignment, but back then I had never used clip-in pedals. 

I did this on a recent Al frame with the exact same problem. I bought a metal (steel) cable boss from the local bike builder and epoxied it myself. I used Loctite's Metal/Concrete epoxy since it's designed for: machinery, appliances, tools, lawnmowers, automotive components, pipes, embedding bolts and screws into metals, concrete or stone and sealing electrical components against moisture and vibration Although lots of other epoxies will probably work. If you do this be sure to read the instructions on the epoxy, clean the surfaces on both parts, and create a good clamp for the piece. It'll take 24 hours to dry fully and you aren't going to achieve good results by holding it with your hands. 

I realize this will be different for all headsets, but: I have a Tange Levin headset. The headset is starting to show wear: the fork sticks at regular intervals through its turning. I've inspected the races and they don't show any visible sign of deformation. Is it possible that only the ball bearings have deformed and that the races are fine? Is it worthwhile to order replacement bearings and reassembling the bike? Has anybody had success doing this? 

it allowed the rotor to work against the 6 posts on the adapter causing some wear it allowed the adapter to work against the hub, also causing some wear. 

I have a frame I would like to get repainted. It is a composite of aluminum and carbon fiber (Al main triangle, carbon fiber seat/chain stays). The carbon fiber is unpainted (maybe a clear coat) and I'd like to keep it this way. 

Disc brake hubs are dished almost equally left/right. You will want to make sure your road/touring rim is not an asymmetric rim, designed for dishing on one side and not the other. This Ritchey Girder is an example: 

I've dented the rim on my Shimano WH-RS-10 rear wheel. I found the tech doc pdf. I've had wheels rebuilt before but always with rims that were available to consumers. I can't find any place that sells the Shimano rim, nipples, or spokes to rebuild this wheel. I know I can get close matches from other companies, but I'm looking for identical components to match the good front wheel I have. Does Shimano actually provide these components for sale? Would this be something my LBS could order? 

I think using a stem raiser may bring your handlebars to a position where you can ride upright. I used the a stem raiser on my cycle with road-style drop bars. This helped me achieve more upright position. This is applicable to the cycles that you have, just make sure the stem diameters match the fittings. An alternative solution would be to use an adjustable stem, here is an example. These options are cheaper than getting a new handle bar setup, unless you are specifically looking to change the handle bar style. The links above are used as example only, I am not affiliated to mentioned organizations. 

In addition to items listed in previous answers, I think it would be very beneficial to bring a couple of small (9 ml) packets of Chamois cream and re-apply as needed at the rest stops. This will reduce a lot of chaffing. 

How often should I check the limit screws on rear derailleur? If the shifter cable tension is less than optimal, would this be a possible cause to drive the chain in between the spokes and the rear cog-set? Excluding the case of debris getting stuck in drive-train; are there any other adjustments besides above two and true-ness of rear wheel that may cause the problem of getting chain between cogs and spokes? 

I considered adding a cage on the flat pedals but I cannot fit my boots in the toe clip. I tried booties on my cleated shoes with clip-in spd pedals, but it is too much effort for commuting, the booties wear out fairly quickly due to frequent stops/walking and I feel that cleated shoes/booties are good for long rides on the weekend. Pedals with SPD on one side and flat on the other still poses the same problem, alignment of foot when using the flat side. 

Once's it's dried be sure to test it by attaching whatever brake/derailleur the boss is for(in your case the rear derailleur) and running cable through it. You need to be sure that the epoxy will hold the forces that will actually be applied by the brake/derailleur** Don't expect your results to look pretty though. 

I'll add that anything hand tight will come loose fairly soon. As the knurled race loosens it will start to damage itself an/or the ball bearings and cause sloppy handling and steering. I'm not saying that you want to torque the race down to the fork, but up against the lock nut as @alex suggests: 

I'm not 100% certain how the DT Swiss centerlock works but it seems like its a way to attach a 6 bolt brake rotor to their hub. What may have happened is that since your center lock was lose: 

From experience, (being an amateur seeing pros at events) a lot of people use Speedplays for better pedal clearance. You can also do something slick like this to create a clip/cleat combination. 

Seems like you have two options. I'm not sure this is your exact model but the broken piece should just unscrew. 

But these require that the axle already be removed. So what is the proper way to remove these bearings? I know that I can just tap the axle out with a rubber mallet and force one of the bearings out, but I think this would damage the bearing. 

About mole grips or locking pliers for us in the US ($URL$ I've never found a pair that were large enough to do this. Also, you lose the hand feedback that regular pliers give you. You won't know when the race is about to slip until its too late. 

My point is that "by hand as hard as you can" won't be good enough. You will need a tool that can grip the knurled race evenly. A pair of slip-joint adjustable pliers which are the right size will work. You want to be able to get both sides of the pliers parallel with each other when gripping the race. Anything less will potentially slip and cause damage to the knurled surface. You might even be able to get a pair with plastic covers over the teeth to protect whatever you are gripping. 

Flat bars have never been comfortable for me for long rides. Check out this link, Sheldon Brown talks a lot about posture to eliminate pain here: $URL$ 

I was taught how to track stand on a fixed gear bike by some velodrome riders and here are some pointers they gave me that really helped me. Keep your pedals roughly horizontal, and turn your front wheel about 45 degrees towards the side that has the front foot. Most beginners don't do this, they move their wheel left/right in an attempt to stabilize the trackstand. While this may work temporarily, it is very bad technique and you won't be able to progress to long seated trackstands like this. Assuming you ride on the right side of the road it is good to learn with the wheel facing left, so that when you get better you'l be able to utilize the camber of the road (you want the wheel pointed uphill, which will be left if you're on the right side of the road). Learning on slight hills is definitely a good idea, but not necessary if you're on a fixed gear bike. I learned to trackstand by not thinking about just stopping and balancing, but focusing on riding into the trackstand. as the pedals approached the horizontal position, I would slow them down, and I'd try to stop with the front pedal slightly higher than the back pedal, this gave me slightly better leverage. Now the important thing is to not rely on turning the wheel right if you start falling over to the right. Use your center of balance to overcompensate to the left. If you see you're constantly falling right, lean more left, and vice versa. Another very important thing to remember while learning is trackstanding is not about standing perfectly still when you're learning, its about forward and backwards movement. If you're on a fixie, alternate putting a tiny amount of pressure on the front foot and on the back foot. You will be rocking back and forth (quite a bit at first), but as you get better you will minimize these movements. On a freewheel the gravity provides the backwards motion, so you apply pressure on the front foot, then let off slightly to rock back. This rocking motion is critical in acquiring the right balance. Again, you should NOT be moving your wheel left-right. You should be using your center of balance for left-right balance, and rock forward and backwards for forwards/backwards balance. Practice is key, eventually I reached the point where I could confidently trackstand sitting down with my hands not on the bars. Re-learning how to trackstand on flat ground on a freewheel is proving to be tough, i'm using the brake to provide a tiny amount of back pressure against the forward pedaling, but havn't been able to maintain it yet really. Hills are cake though. Good luck. sorry for the wall of text. 

I am trying to learn the right way to remove bearings from a track hub. The bearings are cartridge bearings pressed into the hub. The axle has a ridge that prevents it from being removed while both bearings are in place. 

I have some standard rims and I (accidentally) bought tubeless tires. As long as I use rim tape and a tube, can I run these tubeless tires? I know I won't be able to run low tire pressure. But if the tube holds all the pressure is there any danger of the bead unseating? 

You could easily do this your self but you'll likely end up with a rivet gun and a box of 100 rivets you'll never use again (on a bike at least). Whatever method you chose, I'd suggest completing it before any of the rest of your bike build (I'm guessing from the missing front end that you're rebuilding this bike). If you can't get it fixed you might have to scrap (or at least rethink) the project and you don't want to waste any money on other parts until you know for sure. Regarding welding: Aside from the heat issue of welding aluminum, you'll also have a tough (impossible?) time finding someone who can weld a steel boss onto an aluminum frame. Or you'll have an impossible task of finding an aluminum boss to use instead. Think about it.. there's a reason the manufacture glued the boss on in the first place. ** Be extra careful if you are repairing a brake boss. It holds more force and obviously has more dire consequences if it breaks off again. 

Huffy isn't one of those bike companies that has a "nice" well-organized** history, especially in light of its more-recent history: $URL$ So if it is a Huffy, no one at the company will likely be able to confirm it. Additionally, these weren't very (at all?) sought-after bikes so there won't be a user-group maintaining a serial number database (like some high-end brands). ** meaning not bought/sold/rebranded/in-name-only
