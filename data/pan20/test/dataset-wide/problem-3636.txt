No source since this is hearsay - apparently one japanese judo school has a yard where they tied bicycle inner tubes to trees and posts. The wrestler will cricuit between the posts and mimic throws by grabbing pulling those tubes, to get a strhength (or strenght endurance) training very specific to their techniques. 

Edit to add: I do this occasionally, with 10-12 reps per set and leg. I try to be anal about form (feet pointing forward, weight on heel, tight abs) and so far my joints don't complain. When I'm not strict about form something feels wrong immediately. Possibly the pistol is inherently safer. Another possible downside is that it's easy to cheat oneself out of the full range of movement. You need to flexibility to squat deep (ass on heels), balance is easy. All in all I still think I stumbled upon a valuable exercise. 

I'm not sure if there's much you can beyond practicing (Unlime others here I'm skeptical about meditation), but make sure to practice a lot. 

You cannot target specific body parts for fat reduction - you can target certain areas for muscle growth - but this is usually not recommended. Depending on your genetic make up, gender and age you will have different locations on your body where fat cells are more prevalent. You will need to reduce overall body fat (bf%) in order to see a reduction in those areas you're interested in. 

From what I know of the p90X program, it's an intense program based on High Impact Interval Training (HIIT), that alternates exercises every 3-4 weeks to keep the body's adoption to the specific set of exercises from happening. The few people I know who have tried it have seen results, but none have stayed with it long term - the problem with fad exercises and diets...it doesn't set the stage for long term personal changes due to it's required intensity to work. So, specific to the ab ripper - it probably does 'work' if you're looking to burn calories. If you're looking for the '6 pack' goal, you're better off focusing on a well rounded, long term exercise program. IMO 

I happen to have a a screw with an eye sticking idly in my living room ceiling, and I'm thinking about using it to hang a rope for bodyweight rows etc. The screw is 8mmx50mm (thread x length of anchor). The TRX ceiling anchor seems to use 2 screws with 10 mm thread, so I'm a bit concerned about using my screw as is. On the other hand, the TRX product may be vastly overengineered and I have hung my 100kg from my screw a few times. Now my question: Is the setup described above (2 screws, 10mm thread) typical for sling trainers? Are there experiences with using something closer to my thread size, one screw, in a concrete ceiling without the whole thing crashing down? Note for imperialists, I mean folks unused to metric units: 8mm is 0.314 inch, the closest thread size in imperial units is probably 1/4 inch. 

I don't have bench where I can do bodyweight back extensions, nor the space to put one. What are alternatives to work out the lower back? I'm only aware of one - lying flat on the back, place on foot on bench or and raise lower back, works, hamstrings, glute and somewhat lower back. 

My question How should I change my training to have better pectorals, considering my poor pectorals anatomy and all of these informations ? Pictures $URL$

Hip does not bend, hip flexors are worked isometrically only, movement extends only as far as this is doable. As seen in this youtube viseo and on exrx Highly similiar to the first in the outward part of the movement, but the guy actually advises to slightly crunch in the inward part. As seen here. 

I can tell you what my physical therapist advised as exercises after a lumbago. If this is really adequate to your needs, I can't know. However I seem to suffer from a weak core also. I can do 100 crunches, but completely fail at a plank. I was advised to do the following exercises - Ithink they are fairly safe even with previous injuries, because there is so little movement, but I'm not remotely a medical professional. 

The way I heard about one legged squats is to them like this: stand, lower yourself on one leg while the other points forward, then push yourself up. When I try to do this, I don't even get my standing leg to 90° bent before the knee wit hweight on it feels weird and I run into trouble lifting the other leg. So, today I've been doing this: squatting down (sitting on the back of my feet), and then doing a squat where I lift one leg so the other one does all the work. I think it works great and I guess I will feel my legs tomorrow. The feeling in the knees was ok. One I will do different the next time is to force myself to end the movement with my upper body upright, today I cheated a by leaving the torso bent forward. I think when I end the movemnt with my torso upright I will also hit the posterior chain. At a later stage, I may add some weight, before I do that I want to have more feel for the movement as I'm a bit wary for my lower back. The last time I did legwork it was 30 deep bodyweight squats, could have done more, today I did 3 sets of 10 reps per leg. Keeping the balance was no issue. However, I've never seen this way of doing one legged squats advised anywhere and I think I read a bit about bodyeight work. So I wonder if I'm doing something that's horribly unhealthy and I just did not notice. 

Abs are actually built in the gym, to SEE a 6-pack you need to have a low body fat %:7 – 8% for men and 11 – 12% for women (estimates). To get lean and to stay lean long term are two different endeavors and requires a lot of dedication. 

Give it time and don't concentrate on weight - you could be gaining muscle mass or your body could still be adjusting to the new routine - 2-3 months of a consistent change could be required before you start to see some benefits. 

I think you answered your own question - change to stay engaged. I've seeing articles stating that people should change every 10-12 weeks because their bodies adopt to the exercises - but if you have a complete plan, covering your body to meet your goals, there's no - physical reason (and many power builders stay with the same exercises for years). I feel that each workout should be an improvement over the last, increased intensity through weights, duration, etc....but the actual exercises could remain the same as long as they keep you engaged. 

Powerlifting or Aesthetism (speaking about all exercizes) ? Dumbells or bar (only speaking about pectorals exercizes) ? Since 1st september, 2018, I was used to do 5 powerlifting series (each one during only 20 sec) followed by 2 aesthetism series (each one during approx. 1 minute or a bit more, I wasn't as precise as I am now and thus I didn't measure). At bench press only AND for PL series only, I used bar. I can't remember if weither or not these both types of series followed any of the above protocols. Since 1st March, 2018, I only do 2 aesthetism series (each following PROTOCOL #2). I only use dumbells. My pre-training (warming-up) consists in increasing the weights until I reach the first serie's weighs. 4 series of warming are dedicated to that and it's called "potentiation" ; I never reach nervous/muscle fatigue during these series. I always used potentation. My pectorals exercizes 

Finally, my training is extremely complete. But within my 40 sec and within my 20 sec of work, I realized that doing pauses at the maximum of the contraction (I'm used to do it - NOTE that I'm not speaking about my rest-pauses !) impede me from doing [5 ; 7] repetitions. If I don't do any pause (not speaking about rest-pauses !) these [5 ; 7] repetitions are done without great difficulty (i.e. : without hurt). Thus, stopping from doing pauses at the maximum of the contraction implies a possible augmentation of the weights, since the used ones don't hurt me anymore. Otherwise, I would exceed my time under tension of 1 min and that's not good (i.e. : I don't want to use the energy chain of slow fibres). My question Would you recommend me to stop doing pauses at the maximum of the contraction (NOTE that I'm not speaking about my rest-pauses !) in order to allow me to augment my weights ? In other words : is there any benefit to make a pause at the maximum of the contraction that would deencourages me from stoping such a pause ? This benefit could be on hypertrophy or nervous system. Would you recommend me a periodization of that, i.e. : doing pauses at maximum of the contraction on Monday for an exercise A, and not on Thursday for this exercise A ? 

I would recommend a kettlebell class or a personal trainer - depending on your needs. The kettlebell is a tool like any other workout equipment. The idea is to incorporate it within your current program (if you have one) and ensure the program is in tune with your goals (if you have those set). Feeling 'sore' the next day is a good sign that you're working, but does not indicate that your are/are-not using proper technique or if your workout is well rounded. So, direct to your question, yes, I would recommend signing up for a class, it will help define/refine your technique and give you motivation and new workout ideas. 

There is no easy way to lose weight, all you need to do is look around and realize how many obese people there are - eating/getting obese is obviously easier (and more enjoyable short term) than losing weight and getting in shape. So: 

I'm looking to change my workout, just to keep me motivated (I do this every 3-4 months) and wondered if there were any home gym/free (open source like) programs similar to Crossfit or p90x. The problem with either is that they require specific equipment or dvd's......and I'd rather not pay anything. 

I do muaythai and want to do something in between my (infrequent) training session to help my conditioning. I have a conceptual question about what works: 

My observation is that when extending too far, I cannot do the backward portion without a slight, active tuck from the abs. For me, as I have lower back problems, I will do the first version and probably use a door or something to limit range of movement to something managable. Better safe than sorry and all that. Ultimately, which version is safer, which is more effective and why? 

In addition to strength training, I was advised to stretch the lower back and the front tighs. If you want to trust a random stranger on the internet, look at those exercises (and others that will hopefully be suggested). A workout can be quite brief, maybe 10 minutes. Especially one and three are quite taxing, a good thing perfect if you bore easily. Or you may weant to talk to a professional, given your previous injuries. Your call. 

There's many iPhone timers out there - here's one I would recommend. You can assign specific playlist and have it ring or vibrate. An alternative is GymBoss 

Just like spot weight reduction, there is no such thing as spot strength building. From what you describe, the two most beneficial exercises are deadlifts ($URL$ and farmer walks ($URL$ Both will build the off-the-ground power you need, the grip strength required and endurance under stress. I would recommend an overall strength building program, utilizing natural lifting using various forms of weights (sand bags, blocks, slush pipes, etc.) to get your body use to unbalanced lifts. Everything should be focused on core and grip strength. You don't need a gym, and I would recommend working out in the environment that your work will be carried out in (farmer walk on steps, deadlift outside where the ground is uneven). Good luck. 

What are the pros/cons of board bench pressing? I know it helps reduce shoulder strain, but what benefits are there based on being able to lift more weight and what cons since you don't have full ROM (range of motion)? And if you focus on board benching with heavy weights, how do you retain for regular (non-board) post so that you don't hurt those muscles/tendons that aren't used to the heavier load?
