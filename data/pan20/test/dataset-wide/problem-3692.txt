Both of these lifts train the brachialis and the brachioradialis (as well as the biceps brachii). Growing these commonly neglected muscles, and continuing to train the lateral, medial and long head of the triceps, will grow your arms' overall cirumference, and likely add the perception of increased "fatness". 

In short, yes, your daily walks are aerobic activity (definitely not anaerobic...start farmer's walking that distance, and you'll really get some looks as you pass people). Just about any by-the-book doctor would applaud your efforts; you're doubling the American Heart Association's recommendation of 150 minutes/week of light-to-moderate aerobic activity. Is it enough to compliment your resistance training? Yes, in general terms. Your light-to-moderate hour/day walks are slowly improving--at least maintaining--your heart's ability to deliver fuel and remove waste from your muscles. That said, some anaerobic "cardio" every now in then (e.g., interval hill sprints) will improve your muscles' efficiency to use that fuel. If your aim is to be (or continue being) a generally healthy individual, keep doing what you're doing. That said, I'd recommend experimenting with some shorter-session, higher intensity training once or twice a week if you can fit it in your schedule; especially if you consider more specific, performance oriented goals in the future. 

The efficiency of the human body, like any other machine, depends on the surrounding temperature. We get exhausted quicker if we run on a hot summer afternoon than we would in the cooler evening. But how does the temperature influence our calorie burn rate? In a cold environment the body will need to burn calories to produce additional heat, in a hot environment the body needs energy to cool the system. But is this significant during sport? Does it make sense to train in a hot or cold environment to increase the calorie burn rate or is it better to train in a more or less ideal environment? 

Most cardio machines nowadays show an estimate of how many calories you have burned during your training. There are also a lot of different lists available, which activity burns how many calories over a defined period of time. I wonder if those values include the resting burn rate. Lets assume for simplicity reasons my basal metabolic rate allows me to burn 2400 calories each day or 100 calories each hour. If I sit on my bike for one hour and it shows that I burned 600 calories, are the 100 I would have burned anyway included? Did I burn 3000 or 2900 calories that day? This is an important question, especially for easy training, lets take walking as example. According to this calculator, one hour of walking burns 245 calories. Lets say I walk a little more than 2 hours, I have burned 500 calories. I might think I should/can eat 500 calories more that day, while I only might have burned 300 more than I would have without walking. To make a long question short - is the resting burn rate usually included when the calories burned during training are calculated? 

You can definitely work out twice a day, generally speaking. If you're talking about light-to-moderate aerobic sessions and split resistance training, you shouldn't have much to worry about. I'm assuming that you're not focused on any sport-specific performance training, or worried about fine tuning gains for an upcoming bodybuilding competition. If you're just a dude looking to get/stay fit, your main concern with two-a-days should be avoiding fatigue. Again, it doesn't sound like you're at risk with the type of programming you noted, but there are multiple ways to monitor your central nervous system (CNS) to make sure aren't taxing it too heavily: 

It really depends on your goals and programming. The answer could be yes or no. With my current routine, for example, I dead lift, front squat and bench press three times a week, however, I only complete 10 reps of each lift per session (broken up into 2-3 sets, rarely more than 85% 1 RM). Without getting into the fine details of my current program, I'm mainly targeting strength gains (borrowing from some of the core concepts of Dan John's "Easy Strength" musings). In the said routine, I could care less about hypertrophy. If you're targeting hypertrophy (muscle growth), completing a high volume of reps, and/or approaching near failure during sets, you could find yourself in an "overtrained" state pretty quickly (though, as Daniel implied, you'll probably get injured first). In that case, I'd strongly consider completing heavy, compound lifts (ie DL, Squats...) once a week, and work from there. It's hard to completely answer your question without some more details, but if you're really concerned with overtraining prevention, get yourself an HRV (heart rate variability) monitor, keep a log, and go big when your body tells you it's ok. Have fun! EDIT: I see you added that you're doing a 5x5 (sorry if I just missed it the first time around). You could do a 5x5 approach over four days if you wanted, and complete big lifts, like DLs and squats, twice a week. If you're employing this method, a key element to consider is how you progress the load in between sets. Take this guy's program for example (the second program of the two): $URL$ He builds 10-15% each set, until he's finally lifting near his 5 RM in the final set. He does his over 3 days, but you could easily spread it out over 4-5. 

I'm working on setting up a routine workout schedule for myself and I'm in need of some input on whether this would work well. Basically I bike 8 miles a day and I want to just alternate pushups, situps and pullups with rest one day a week. I'm looking to get buffer and get a six pack. Right now I can do 25 pushups without stopping and I'm 160lb, so that gives you a sense of my current muscle mass. Does the above plan sound fine? 

I've recently began to watch closely what I eat. I follow the following guidelines: -no refined carbs, eat whole grain organic carbs. I eat brown rice and whole wheat pasta. -lots of vegetables. I'm single and don't want to spend too much time cooking so I buy many bags of frozen cut vegetables. -limited meat, I eat around 1/3 lb of meat or less of meat per day. I usually eat ground beef, frozen meat/fish balls, or on occasion chicken breasts -for snacks I eat almonds and fruits -no sugary drinks or dairy products(I'm not a big fan). Instead consume soy products like tofu -lots of eggs how healthy is this diet? My goal is to lose excess body fat and at the same time gain more muscles. I have a fairly moderate workout schedule consisting of pushups and pullups on alternate days. thanks
