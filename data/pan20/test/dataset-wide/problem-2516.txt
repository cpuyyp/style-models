Your actions are the results of choices that come and go. You can change yourself through changes in your actions. Like the porridge in the story of Goldilocks, you have all kinds of choices, but what you want is the one that’s just right. You always shape your life by the choices you make in what you say and do. If you’re not convinced of the importance of your actions, your actions are careless. The usual culprits are distractions, either internal or external. The internal ones are other thoughts, other intentions. Usually we are not in charge of our thoughts and act impulsively. It is our cravings and our ignorance / Avijja (Avidya) that determine what those choices we make. A lot of them are buried in subconscious parts of your awareness. We shape our life by the choices we make in what we say and do. The aggregate of volitional activities (sankharakkhandha) is a burden. Life demands that we satisfy our daily needs and desires and for that satisfaction we decide on A over B, or B over A. This choice gets encouragement from our volition prompted by desire. 

May I add another thought all of the good answers provided so far? This is what Kassapa Buddha said (as per the scriptures) on this issue. Kassapa Buddha is the sixth of the Seven Buddhas of Antiquity, and the third of the five Buddhas of the present kalpa. Sutta Nipata 2.2: Here the Buddha recalled an incident in his previous life during the Buddha Kassapa’s time. Buddha Kassapa was his teacher then. It was an occasion when an external sect ascetic met the Buddha Kassapa and reviled him for eating meat, which he said is a stench compared to eating vegetarian food. Buddha Kassapa replied: “Killing … wounding … stealing, lying, deceiving … adultery; this is stench. Not the eating of meat… Those who are rude, arrogant, backbiting, treacherous, unkind … miserly … this is stench. Not the eating of meat… Anger, pride, obstinacy, antagonism, deceit, envy, boasting … this is stench. Not the eating of meat… Those who are of bad morals, … slanderous … pretentious … being the vilest of men, commit such wrong things; this is stench. Not the eating of meat ….” 

The Law of Attraction says “Like attracts like” and “Birds of feather flock together”. This is based upon the idea that people and their thoughts are both made from pure energy, and the belief that like energy attracts like energy. The scriptures too attest to this truth. In the Samyuktha Nikaya, Kamma Sutta 3 (S.ii.155) that was preached at Gijjhakūta, the Buddha tells the gathered bhikkhus: “Do you see Ven. Sāriputta, walking with several other bhikkhus? All those bhikkhus have great wisdom.” “Do you see Ven. Moggallāna, walking with several other bhikkhus? All those bhikkhus have great spiritual powers.” “Do you sees Mahā Kassapa ,walking with several other bhikkhus? All those bhikkhus are proponents of the Ascetic practices.” “Do you see Ven. Anuruddha, walking with several other bhikkhus? All those bhikkhus possess the devine eye.” “Do you see Ven. Punna Mantānīputta, walking with several other bhikkhus? All those bhikkhus are speakers on the Dhamma.” “Do you see Ven. Upāli, walking with several other bhikkhus? All those bhikkhus are upholders of the discipline.” “Do you see Ven. Ananda, walking with several other bhikkhus? All those bhikkhus are highly learned.” “Do you see Devadatta, walking with several other bhikkhus? All those bhikkhus have evil wishes.” Buddha ends this discourse by saying that beings of similar disposition come together. 

Existence is nourished by four nutriments as pointed out in the Sutta in @Dhammadhatu ‘s OP. They are essential to continue life in this repeated existence in samsara. This is true even to the deities in the celestial world and brahmas in the Brahma world. Of these four kinds, one is material/physical, and the other three are mental nutriments. The first is the easy one as @Dhammadhatu pointed out. But how can one see one’s mental state or mental growth if not for the guidance that the Buddha provided in many of the suttas? The Buddha provided the explanation in the Atthi Raga Sutta (where there is passion) in the Samyutta Nikaya. How we have to view the four similes is that ONLY if we eradicate the Cause, would the Result be eradicated, and NOT otherwise. It is our Desire for Life that prevents this. The day that we establish wisdom over ignorance, and liberation over desire, we will see the light. The day we remove our passion, delight and craving for the four nutriments Consciousness will not arise. Then mentality-materiality won’t happen, and as a result there is no growth of fabrications, and no renewed becoming. If no future birth, there is no decay, death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief and despair. To explain the 2nd simile - that of the nutriment sense-impression: Sense impression (phassa ahara) is Contact. So what is contact? It is the coming together of three things. It is the eye, the visible object and consciousness coming in contact with each other (seeing forms). It is the ear, sounds and consciousness coming in contact with each other (hearing sound). it is the nose, odours and consciousness coming in contact with each other (smelling odours), and likewise. What is important to understand is with the arising of consciousness, it is inevitable for contact to arise. Only if we eradicate the desire for what we see, hear, smell, taste, touch and think, will the contact and consciousness not arise. The simile of the flayed cow is about this contact that one cannot get away from as long as there is desire. To explain the 3rd simile - that of the nutriment volitional thought: Volitional thought (Cetana) is Intellectual Intention. It is the arising of wholesome or unwholesome intentions. As before, these mental factors are a result of desire. Beings who cannot comprehend that these mental factors are not permanent, that they constantly change, and be mindful, gets thrown into the pit whether they like it or not. Only getaway is eradicating the cause – the arising of ‘cetana’ – of intellectual intention. To explain the 4th simile - that of the nutriment of Consciousness: Our sense faculties are constantly contacted and stimulated because of Consciousness as explained before. The two that I did not touch on are that of the body and intellect. Dependent on the body and tactile sensations, arises consciousness at the body. Dependent on the intellect (ideas/thoughts), there arises consciousness at the intellect. With the Consciousness, desire arises. This arising of passion, delight and craving results in greed, hatred and delusion – these are the spears that one gets shot at with. As long as you have passion, delight and craving, you are alive and get shot at and experiences pain and distress. So our Desire for the Dhamma, to live in the Dhamma should be even greater than our desire for Life. Those are the ones who will stay in the finger tip. What the Buddha has said is patisotagami or against the current of conventional thinking. Buddha knew this well. That is why He said, 

Rebirth is regarded by the Supreme Buddha as essential and foundational to the pursuit of His teachings. This is very evident and is clearly illustrated in the Dependent Origination (Paticca samuppāda) that the being is born in the Becoming (bhava) caused by the grasping or attachment (upādāna) as stated "Upādāna paccaya bhavō, bhava paccaya jati...," But many people have mistaken the Becoming given here to soul or ego (ātma). This clearly shows that 'Rebirth' is integral to the Dependent Origination taught by the Supreme Buddha and is one of the twelve reasons that all of us are unable to comprehend. What are these twelve reasons? 

A good method to start finding the core values of Buddhism, @tuskiomi, is to start reading the Dhammapada (The Way of Truth). These are “Stanzas on Dhamma”, a popular collection of 432 pithy verses of a largely ethical nature. There is always a story behind every verse. The Dhammapada is very accessible, many copies of which are found for free distribution through temples and Buddhist societies, and also on the internet. In the Dhammapada you will see a lot of ‘shoulds’. But each should is based on a condition, “This is what should be done by one if one desires that.” So it is your choice to do it or not. But if that is what you want, this is what you’ve got to do. The nature of cause and effect is such that these are the practices you have to follow. I will give you a few examples that you will find in: $URL$ “If when you see that there’s a greater happiness that comes from abandoning a lesser happiness, be willing to abandon that lesser happiness for the sake of the greater one.” “A hand without a wound can hold poison and not be harmed. In other words, if you don’t have any bad kamma, the results of bad kamma won’t come to you. But if you have a wound on your hand, then if you hold poison it will seep through the wound and kill you.” “All tremble at violence. Life is dear to all. Putting oneself in the place of another, One should neither kill nor cause another to kill.” People who recognize their own mistakes and change their ways “illumine the world like the moon when freed from a cloud.” “Better than a thousand meaningless statements Is one meaningful word Which, having been heard, Brings peace.” 

It looks like you have found the right article on how to practice the Breathing Meditation. Than rejecting this, instead try to concentrate on training the mind. All the Buddha’s teachings— on generosity, virtue, and meditation, or on virtue, concentration, and discernment—are aimed at training the mind because the mind is what shapes our experience of pleasure and pain, happiness and suffering. A well‐trained mind can deal with issues that you come across in meditation. This require effort. They go against the grain. You have to learn not to let your resistance to the effort get in the way. You need a clear sense of cause and effect. That’s what discernment is all about: seeing what really works in terms of cause and effect, what doesn’t really work, and then adjusting your actions accordingly. We’re here to train the mind to be its own best friend. One way of doing this is to focus on your breath. It is best if you’ll sense the breath as the feeling of the air moving in and out of the nose, but if it is difficult, then be aware (but not solely focus on) the rise and fall of the abdomen, the rise and fall of the chest. Sometimes can sense even in your arms or your legs whether you’re breathing in or breathing out. Allow breath to come in as long as is comfortable, and then allow yourself to breathe out as long as is comfortable. Try to sensitize yourself to what feels good right now in terms of the breathing. Think of yourself as hovering around the breath. You’re not squeezing it out; you’re not forcing it in; you’re just staying very close to it, watching it, letting it adjust in whatever way feels good, giving it space to adjust. The more satisfying the breath is, the easier you will find it to stay with the breathing. If the mind wanders off, just bring it right back to the breath. If it wanders off again, bring it back again. Mind will want to wander around. That’s what the mind is used to doing. But if you’re firm with it, and if you can master just this one skill, you change the way you relate to your body, you change the way you relate to the present moment, you have a greater reserve of wellbeing to draw on in any situation. Do not be too grim about the meditation. Find pleasure in, and be happy even if it a short while that you were with the breath. It takes time, it takes training, it takes discipline. But you must remain happy to do it well.
