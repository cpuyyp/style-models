"Of what benefit could Christian altruism possibly be to me?" (when it could disadvantage you?) "Why should I obey the teachings of Christ and 'love my neighbor' when he has clearly wronged me?" (when you could be physically harmed?) "What need is there for secular morality when I have the teachings of the Bible and the canons of the Church?" 

As for his aphorisms, given their pithy and brief nature, you need to think long and hard about them, and not cave to the temptation of appropriating them out of context. Furthermore, it is beneficial to seek the expertise of Nietzsche researchers, who can better provide the context and clarity of how and why he wrote with an affinity for aphorisms. I could write on and on, but I hope this is a good modus operandi for approaching his fantastic works. Best of luck! 

The work that first comes to mind is Edmund Husserl's Philosophy of Arithmetic. He addresses in some detail the obvious difficulty with number: that to count the things counted must be both different (so there may be more than one) and the same (you are counting certain things). When I say "three apples" they are all the same in one sense (they're apples) and they are all different in another (there are three of them, distinguished by their spatial relationship if nothing else) There is simultaneous "multiplicity" and "unity". This leads to the question "the same in what way, and different in what way". The thing I remember the most from this book is discussion of difference and distinguishing. It's something worth talking about. There are two terms that can be contrasted, "different", "distinguished". 

This sounds a bit more like Kant to me. His transcendental idealism is usually considered a response to Hume. The major difference is about whether there are certain concepts that are not learned from experience (a priori). Hume was skeptical about it but Kant thought that there are some things that structure all of our thoughts, without which thought would be impossible. (In science there is Bayesian approaches to perception and cognition, which also sound similar to your suggestions.) 

Having read some of Friedrich Nietzsche's philosophical works, as well as the acclaimed biography of Nietzsche by Curtis Cate (which I suggest all those who are interested in Nietzsche should read), I understand that Nietzsche did not view Plato and his philosophy favorably, specifically, the Platonic ideal, and the notion of otherworldly truth and knowledge. Whether or not there is any record of Nietzsche's specific opinion on the allegory, I am unaware of, but I shall still try to opine on the matter. Given his scrutiny of Plato however, I'm inclined to believe it is somewhere out there. I conjecture that the element of the story that Nietzsche would most approve of is the particular man's escape from the cave, and his venturing out into the 'real' world, out beyond the confines of the cave. Allegorically and in a Nietzschean spirit, the primitive and suffocating cave, and its residents, could represent the mediocrity of the prevailing intellectual and moral system, which would rather continue a fixation with mere reflections of 'reality' than attempt a constructive investigation of ethics and reality. My current understanding of Nietzsche lends me to the belief that this man, who has escaped the mirages and projections of what is real, would posses the opportunity of truly escaping "the herd" that resides within the cave, a term Nietzsche usually uses to describe the prevailing morality of the masses, influenced by Christian dogma as well as ossified by historical inertia. Thus, this lone man (the primordial Ãœbermensch perhaps?), who has escaped (by chance, if I remember the allegory correctly), has triumphed over the rest in his opportunity to grasp the world as it really is. The interesting literary and situational parallels to Zarathustra are many to be considered. As to whether there was anything 'real' outside of the cave, I believe that Nietzsche would not deny a physical reality 'of the way things are' outside of the projections and pretenses of conventional morality, and how morality influences the worldview. After all, he believed very much so, based upon what I can gather from On the Genealogy of Morality, that science during his time was one of the factors that contributed to the abandonment of traditional knowledge and virtues, so much so that he may have feared its unintended or insidious contribution to cultural nihilism. At any rate, Nietzsche did now infamously quote "there are no facts, merely interpretations", or something to that effect, though there is a greater context to that statement within The Genealogy. Still, Nietzsche was not anti-science, and within the understanding of the allegory, the man's escape from projection and duplicity towards reality and empiricism (after all, he relied upon his senses to absorb and intake the real, outside world) would be consistent with Nietzsche's urging of 'self-overcoming', which is another related concept. 

Note: The details of how arithmetic becomes abstracted from human judgements is covered in the remainder of Husserl's book. I'm not really capable of articulating it here. I think there might be some problems with it in light of recent scientific research "numerousity". I'm not sure yet. 

I think there is a lot of truth to what iphigenie has said in the comments about it being a library label. There are philosophical questions addressed in all of the sciences and scientific topics are found in philosophy. But because of the way academia works, the gap is a bit wider than this might suggest. Philosophers end up reading work by philosophers, physicists primarily read work by other physicists, biologists: other biologists and so on. This in turn affects the language used, the impact of ideas, and reduces the cross talk between them. This is before we start on the various prejudices that this breeds. I imagine that if one drew a graph of citations, one would find a fairly strong grouping of different subjects. So, I would say that there is a fairly strong boundary between the academic disciplines, each discipline gets it's own independent "momentum", affecting which questions are being asked, and how they are framed and addressed. You might say this is just the structure of academia and completely misses the point about whether a question is philosophical or not. But I don't think it's irrelevant. I'd like to illustrate this with a case from biology, the question "what is an organism?" - is this a philosophical question? If you looked at what I would consider the philosophical side of the biology literature you would find rather empirical approaches. The authors of this paper draws from empirical approaches, and they end up focusing primarily on cooperation and adaptation - all in the tradition of evolutionary biology. The aim, it seems, is to understand evolution. But if you look at what I would consider the biological side of philosophy literature (for example, these), there are completely different approaches, concerning autonomy and agency. Concepts follow in a vaguely continental philosophical tradition. The aim being a general understanding of the general questions concerning life. So, there are more empirical and more philosophical answers to the same question. I would suggest that a better distinction would be between philosophical or non-philosophical traditions, how different groups of people have decided to address the same salient questions. 

As with many instances in the progression of intellectual history, in order to understand the now, it is important to understand what has come before the now. With specificity to Nietzsche, it is important to recognize the influences of European philosophers, psychologists, scientists, and even musicians upon him (an aside, music was an important aspect of his life). Specifically, such names that come to mind are Schopenhauer, Kant, Hegel, Darwin, and who can forget Wagner! Each of these individuals, and more, produced an impact upon his thinking, whether in his approval or disapproval of their ideas, or even more analytically, a strange, sometimes ironic mixture of both. I highly suggest reading Friedrich Nietzsche by Curtis Cate, who crafts an excellent and truly enlightening biography of the personal and intellectual history of Nietzsche, which has helped enormously in understanding his later works. I think it somewhat vain for me to try to "correctly" answer how to "properly" read Nietzsche (or any philosopher for that matter), so I will outline how I approach his texts. Remember, this is after having read the biography mentioned above and having gained the reference, context, and knowledge of the milieu and events surrounding the numerous inceptions-and completions-of his many works. Furthermore, the astounding work of Nietzsche scholars (such as Walter Kaufmann) in the form of historical and comparative research has produced conveniently organized footnotes in most texts that I urge you not to ignore. This advice, I think, is also not particular to Nietzsche, but is a generally helpful and advantageous approach to reading philosophy in general. And as a final note, do not forget that the English text is and always will be a translation of the original German; take that as you will. For larger, continuous works (i.e., not aphorisms): 

As this premise is false the induction does not give a the correct answer (though the argument itself is valid). Your question is related to the widely known problem of induction. But this case is less problematic because one can actually list all cities and see that the list is indeed finite. If the task was to show that it is infinite it would be a different matter. 

Can someone name the most well known philosophers to explicitly put forward an idea along the lines that formal systems can only be used descriptively, not prescriptively - that they're just a model, and when they disagree with us, it is them that is wrong - that human judgement trumps logic. I ask because it feels like it's an idea that would have some history to it. 

What do phenomenologists mean by "Horizon". I thought I understood it from the context when I first saw it, but every time I see it I get more confused. Now I have no idea. Can someone explain what it is? 

Of course, these three questions are just microscopic inquiries when approaching and evaluating religious thought and its titanic impact on society throughout the ages and different parts of the world. Furthermore it is important to distinguish between the individual actions and beliefs of religious folk in sometimes contradistinction to the official teachings and promulgations of the central religious body. Furthermore, are you referring to the Abrahamic religions? The Hindu religion? Those of the Far East? These are certainly big questions, but perhaps you could refine the approach and adjust the focus through one of many scientific lenses. This already sounds like a topic that would suggest familiarizing yourself with the English biologist Richard Dawkins, who has written a number of books on the matter. Best of luck. Edit: I figured I better append my response with the clarification that the vast majority of human beings are not subject to the same evolutionary forces and principles that act upon populations in the wild. But it is still worthwhile to consider how religiosity might affect the favorability of traits and behaviors. 

There is quite a tradition in philosophy concerning the setting aside of various beliefs about the world, with the aim of getting a better understanding. It stretches back at least as far as ancient Greece, and continues today. However, the idea of setting aside certain beliefs about the world is not in conflict with having knowledge. In fact, without knowledge it is impossible. Let me explain, I'll try and phrase things to match your question, but it is not my usual mode of expression... When we embark on the journey of comprehending something we bring with us certain beliefs. This is the case whether this undertaking is one we have actively sought or otherwise. These beliefs are silent, they sit in the background, unobserved. When we are first acquainted with something, we unavoidably comprehend it in terms of these hidden beliefs. Luckily, we can do something about these preconceptions by making effort to be aware of potential hidden beliefs, whether it is in the form of reading philosophy, meditation, socialising, exploring or whatever. Whichever it might be, this gives us knowledge in the form of awareness of how our beliefs might affect our comprehension. This knowledge gives us the ability to step back and see things in more clarity and depth, the ability to see that something can be seen from other perspectives (or as Hunan put it, we get "awareness of realities") - we need knowledge to set aside beliefs. Now the idea that anyone could be unbiased in this way at all seems kind of natural because at one point in everyone's lives they were unaware of the possibility that they had these biases. Everyone knows what it was like to think that they were not bringing prejudices into their understanding. This experience coincides with the least knowledgeable parts of our lives (i.e. childhood). What one seeks when setting beliefs aside - in it's most comprehensive form - is the kind of certainty in the self-evident truth that the naivity of childhood once afforded. We wish to return to a state where things are what they seem to be: but not through the naivity we left with, but through wisdom. To comprehend to our greatest ability we should be mindful, not mindless! 

If you wish to claim that, historically in the West and near East, the imposition of the will of a religious body against other actors within society has delayed 'inevitable' advancements in the technological, social, scientific, and philosophical realms, then you are essentially correct and do not need to look far for instances of historical evidence. Mind you, this is a phenomenon that is not unique to religion. Now whether or not 'religions' necessarily preclude or at least discourage secular 'innovation' is much less clear, and difficult to prove. Attempting to do so would require a massive surveying of history since early Christianity, and perhaps even before, and would become an interdisciplinary approach. Attempting to isolate the effects of religious forces on society would prove even more difficult a task, so instead I shall attempt to opine on your thoughts. Essentially, it can of course be argued from an evolutionary perspective that predominately those organisms (in this case, humans) that can change and adapt positively to the flux of the environment are better suited to survive and perpetuate their genealogy. "Innovation" is a just sophisticated term to describe the human version of this effect, that is, the engaging of the mental, physical, and sometimes social faculties in order to improve the standard of living, and therefore the likelihood of survival, and ultimately, procreation, to continue the evolutionary argument. Adopting this view is consistent with your proposal of how innovation manifests and what it entails. The difficult question I think you are implicitly posing is whether or not the ideas and attitudes that accompany (theistic) religious piety has an evolutionary advantage, or disadvantage. E.g., 

In actual nothingness (1), you would cease to exist (though its better to say that you can't go there), in "epistemological nothingness" (2) you can go there, but we can only guess as to what it is like. 

The distinction that springs to mind is between mechanistic vs. empirical explanations. This is used in philosophy of science and I've come across it in philosophical debates concerning evidence based medicine and in law (others too), where there is some conflict over whether an empirical account is valid without a mechanistic account, and vice versa. Mechanistic - understanding how things work in detail, and from principles, laws etc. In its extreme a reductionistic, microscopic account. Empirical - does changing X result in Y. Not how it works, but does it work. In it's extreme a holistic, macroscopic account. It also correlates quite well with the distinction between hard vs. soft science. I'm not sure I would want to call these terms epistemological but they are used in modern discussion, and I feel they capture what you are describing.
