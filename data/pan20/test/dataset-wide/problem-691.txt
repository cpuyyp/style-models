When you are braking you are putting quite some load on the frame where the brakes are installed. (Newton's 3rd principle of dynamics: to each action corresponds an equal reaction with same intensity and opposite direction) If the frame is not designed for this, you are aiming for disaster. So, if the fork was not designed to have disc brakes installed, don't do it. 

I have recently been in a neighborhood watch training. Bike theft was one of the topic. They showed us a footage where they asked a skilled thief to break various locks, from low end dental floss (10 Euro worth) to high end sturdy looking one (60 Euro). The thief was able to take rid of all of them in a matter of about 30 seconds, with few difference between flimsy and sturdy ones. Bottom line: the only way to safely lock your bike is make it an hassle to remove all the locks with respect to the other available targets. 

Lately I have been using a head lamp, installed on my helmet, while commuting to work. For improving safety, and considering that I have a bar fixture for a handlebar bag which is unused for my commute, I was thinking of having a 3D printed thingy to attach the head lamp to the steering bar via the fixture. Is there any shortcoming on this? 

Bangalore, India Regular buses do not allow cycles, especially since the door is too small to take it through. Ac-buses are supposed to allow you to take your cycle. You will be charged an extra 'luggage' fee which keeps changing so I shan't bother mentioning it. However, during peak times conductors will often disallow you due to lack of space. If you want to travel by bus, try doing so in the early morning or early afternoon. Metros do allow cycles 

You will have to decide the worthwhileness of the project for yourself. Money wise it won't cost much more than $50 (~20 for the seat, and the rest for brake pads and other implements like WD-40 if you don't have them). I would personally do it less to save money but more for the learning that would be gained from doing it. But the importance given to learning experiences differ from person to person and its up to you 

I had a similar problem with a recently serviced relatively old trek. When I applied brakes or did a bunny hop, I could feel the handle move around. This may not apply to you since your bike is no where near as old as mine was but this was the problem with mine. The bearings in the tube had worn out significantly and dirt and grime had taken the place of metal. When I rebuilt it and removed all the dirt after it was sitting in my garage for nearly 3years unused, the gap became more noticeable. My only choice was to replace the bearing. This might be your problem if you've not used it for a long time and you recently cleaned up the inside of it. Note: the compression bolt mentioned above did nothing to remedy the solution. So if it doesn't in your case too, the bearing might just have worn out from use and grime stuck inside prevented you from noticing it 

When choosing a rear bike stand, does it make any difference that it clamps to 1 or 2 tubes of the chassis? 

Of course no, it doesn't do any harm that the helmet gets wet in WATER. It is made of various plastics, which per se are insensitive to water, and also it is supposed to be worn even though the cyclist is cycling under rain or snow. Also, your sweat is basically water and some salts. If water was dangerous to helmets you should not sweat when wearing them :) Just avoid that it gets wet by organic solvents (acetone, benzene, etc.), as they might attack some of the plastic and drastically alter their mechanical properties, leaving to your head the same protection offered by a shopper. The advice to not paint or put stickers on the helmet comes from the above point, as some paints or glue can contain non suitable solvents. 

Remove bottle from bottle cage and keep riding using the hand not holding the bottle Pull up the cap with teeth Squeeze bottle in the mouth (if soft bottle) or suck liquid in (if hard bottle) Swallow and repeat if necessary Push back bottle cap with mouth/teeth Place bottle back in bottle cage 

When it happened to me and I could not ride elsewhere, I preferred first to acknowledge the waiting drivers I noticed their presence (by raising my hand, so that they don't get into the mood of " this guy is not giving a dam about me") and then taking the first chance to stop on the side and let the queue proceed. I did this even when going downhill on a mountain road and I was travelling around the speed limit of 50 km/h and had trucks and cars behind me. In your case you can consider using the pavement strictly for the time necessary for the waiting cars to take your over. 

Measure the rim in a more accurate way for starters. Even 0.1mm can cause a change in the braking power. Also, with the bike resting on its handles and seat, flipped over, ask someone to lightly hold down the front brake while you slowly turn the wheel and figure out exactly where the trouble spot is and how big it is. If there is no visible difference, and you don't have the means to measure the rim more accurately, then it probably is the width of the rim being uneven. On the other hand if you find that it does not occur at the same spot every time, maybe the problem is elsewhere. If you can, see if the width of the rim changes radially, fatter near the tire and thinner near the spokes. If the difference in this width isn't constant, it could be causing the problem 

Good epoxy is known to bond metals, especially aluminum very well. Make sure the surfaces are clean and slightly rough for a better bond. I use the same two part epoxy hobbyist aircraft builders use for fixing pretty much anything, including broken ceramic mugs, small broken metal things and even as an insulator on the bottom of PCBs to prevent any shorts. When looking for replacement cable stops try to get something with a solid base and not hollow so you can glue the whole thing down. From the looks of it the original was only glues around the edge which is probably why it came of. Another solution could be solder. It will be stronger but look a little asymmetrical, but as long as you do it to the other cable stop too it should look fine. It melts at a low enough temperature for nothing to happen to the heat treatment of the aluminum. I take no responsibility for the frame if you do this however, it's only my guess, and is completely untested. Would like some input by someone who knows a little more about solder and hest treated aluminum about this solution, it seems workable 

Depending on the place where you live, you might have the possibility to return your purchase and have your money back. Nevertheless it would be a good customer policy for the dealer and the manufacturer to have a happy customer: I would try contacting both and explaining the issue makes you really unhappy with the choice you have done. If it is due to poor assembly, changing shop is probably the best option, but on that the manufacturer can provide better advice. 

you end up having 6 to 8 actual speeds (2 or 3 rear on each front gear). Then there is the point if you would ever use all of them. You probably will if you use your bike in a hilly region or on challenging surfaces. I now cycle in the Netherlands and I see fellow cyclists switching to a lower gear when they stop at a traffic light, like they would do with a car or a motorbike. IMHO that's really nonsense, as I catch them without changing gear before they are even done crossing the road. 

Is there any good reason to go for an high end-ish or for the cool end-ish, or is it just plain old marketing tricks? 

Not requested by your question: The rear light usually had connection to the frame via the mud shield (either it was made of metal, or had a metallic strip in the plastic body. 

First, you should understand how suspensions with lockouts work. Fluid suspensions(oil or air) like yours have a valve inside them that lets the fluid flow through at a constricted rate on the way up, and very quickly on the way down. This is what gives the dampening effect on suspensions. Lockouts effectively completely close off that valve. However, obviously the valve is not infinitely strong. At some point, it will give way and let the air through. This is where blow-offs come in. Blow-off basically refers to that point where the lockout 'fails' and dampens the shock anyway. The model you have has something called TurnKey which is Rock Shox patented name for blow-off. It has an adjustable blow-off point which will let you set the amount of force required for the blow-off to occur. Now that you know how these systems work, consider your case of riding your MTB as a BMX on a track. If you set the turnkey/blowoff too low, you'll risk it suddenly dropping on a big landing and if you are taking a turn or something immediately after, you can risk losing your balance. If you set it too high, you probably can damage the valve in the shocks by stressing it too much. So to conclude, not really, riding on the lockout won't affect the suspension too much because as soon as the wheel hits something too hard, the lockout will 'fail' and go back to normal damping as long as you don't set the blow-off so high that it is practically impossible to hit the bow-off. Just don't set it so low you hit the drop-off all the time and defeat the point of locking out. 

I have often noticed that, whenever a race bike is running with free wheel (so no active pedals movements), I can hear a distinct "tick tick tick tick" coming from the rear wheel, sounding more or less like a speedy clock. That doesn't happen neither on my cheap city bike, nor on my more expensive tourism bike. Is it a matter of proper lubrication, or is it also an indirect index of how good the gear is? I would guess that if I hear a sound, some energy is being spent to generate it, and that energy comes from the bike motion. Therefore I would assume that a better bike with lower resistance would be more silent. 

I commute on 28 km/day at 22-25 km/h average. I normally use a city bike, where I am not exactly leaning forward but neither sitting at 90 degrees. 

I have checked the worn pads I recently replaced on my bike. The remaining of the grooves were filled with debris from the pad wear. Therefore I think the grooves serve the purpose of discharging the worn layer of the pad which is removed during the braking action, so that the action itself can be more effective. Imagine what happens when you brake: the pads push on the rim, and being the rim metal it's not going to wear that much against rubber. Therefore rubber has to wear. The debris will be transported between the pad and the rim surfaces, aggregating with each other as the travelled distance increase, acting as rollers and decreasing the friction coefficient and therefore the braking power. If you have some grooves in the surface the debris can be captured there without lowering too much the braking effectiveness. 

This happens everytime one replaces a component of the drivetrain since the original cable position is rarely restored. He needs to do something called indexing the gears. It is a common procedure and there are many good tutorials online explaining how to do it much better than I could. Here is one I'd trust- 

Presta Valves, or any valve for that matter do not leak after you have taken the pump head off. The valve should automatically close even without you having to screw down the valve. Doing that only applies pressure on the valve to reduce leakage over time even further. If the valve keeps leaking till you screw it down means that there is some damage in the rubber of the tube valve. Where I live we can actually buy just the tube valve, disassemble the presta valve and replace the tube which might be damaged. However, that requires some experience and a tube valve which you are unlikely to find. Your best bet is to just buy a new tube. Sidenote: Even on a new/fixed tube you will always have some very small leakage when you pull the pump head off. This is because that little pin that gets pressed down(that's what opens the valve and allows air in) when you put the head on has to come back up and that only happens as fast as you can take the head off. So don't be alarmed if you hear a short hiss when you pull the head off. To reduce it, try pulling the head in one clean jerk but it really wouldn't change much compared to the total volume of the tire
