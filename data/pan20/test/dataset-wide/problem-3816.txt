"Euler-Maclaurin": $$ \sum_{n = 0}^{N} a(n) K(n,x) = R(N, x) \int_{0}^{N} a(n) K(n,x) \, dn \tag{10}$$ This seems fine, because we just need $Q(x) = \lim_{N \to \infty} R(N, x)$ to be pole-free when $|x| < 1$, and $\lim_{x \to 0} Q(x) = 1$. Here we can take $a(n) = a([n])$ where $[n]$ is round to the nearest integer. "Orthogonality": $$\int_{0}^{\infty} a(n) K(n,x) \, dn = a(0) \delta(x) \tag{11}$$ This seems tough. Let: $$\Delta(N, x) = \int_{0}^{N} a(n) K(n,x) \, dn \tag{12}$$ Now for some $x \neq 0$, $|x| < 1$, we'll find $\Delta(N, x)$ oscillating around $0$ as $N \to \infty$. For example, take $K(n,x) = \pi J_0(2\pi\sqrt{nx})$, $x=\frac{1}{2}$, then here is $\Delta(N, x)$ for $N$ from $0$ to $500$: 

A wild guess is it is bounded by $O(N^{\frac{1}{2} + \epsilon})$, although this might ends up as difficult as RH, or, just the same as proving the modularity of $a(n)$. Will some stationary phase etc. method work? For the Poisson summation case, the $\Delta(N, x)$ is trivially bounded, which is why it is so simple. 

For a year I have been giving lectures on a (probalby) new way to present an explicit sphere eversion. These lectures include a review of many other explicit eversions that have been described, as text, drawings or even computer generated movies, since Smale proved his theorem. During these lectures, I have been frequently asked the following question: are these eversions all equivalent? I suppose the meaning of this question is: can you deform one eversion into another? A more general question is: What is the $\pi_1$ of the space $I$ of immersions of $S^2$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$? Recall that Smale proved that $I$ is connected so that there is a path from the canonical embedding to the antipodal embedding, which is the definition of a sphere eversion. The set of all eversions up to homotopy is in (non canonical) bijection with the $\pi_1$ above. If the latter were trivial, then all eversions would be equivalent, and conversely. But as far as I have understood, it is not the case.

I'm studying the classic results on binary (integer) quadratic forms and I'm looking for a reference on the following result (maybe a book that contains a proof): Let $O_k$ be the ring of algebraic integers of $Q(\sqrt{d})$. In the set of ideals of $O_k$, we define the equivalence relation $I \sim J \Leftrightarrow \exists a,b : (a)I=(b)J$ where $(a)$ is the ideal generated by $a$. Then, the equivalence classes of $\sim$ form a group $G$ with the usual multiplication of ideals. Furthermore, $|G|=h(d)$, where $h(d)$ is the class number. The definition I've read for $h(d)$ is the number of equivalence classes of quadratic forms with discriminant $d$ for the equivalence relation $f \sim g \Leftrightarrow f(x,y)=g(px+qy,rx+sy)$ with $ps-qr=1$. If someone could give me a good reference in this nice connection I would be really grateful. 

For a research project I'm currently working on, I came across the following problem: Let $A=$ $^{k <x,y> }\Big/_{(yx-xy-1)}$ be the Weyl Algebra over a field $k$ of characteristic $p$, where $p$ is an odd prime. For an element $q(x,y) \in A$, define the operator $ad_q(h):=[q,h]=qh-hq$. My question is: 

In short: D is hyperbolic, C is parabolic (this is very vague, I know; there is at least one thing that makes me uneasy about all this presentation of things: that C nevertheless contains D.). Now, anytime you have an island, you have a patch that is a copy of the domain D$_i$. If you start from a point in the domain, mapped in D$_i$, and try to lift D$_i$ by f and hit a problem, is may be because you need to put a ramification point, so this increases the number of patches you need... kind of... in fact you will probalbyhave to cut your patch into smaller pieces, because of more ramification points: but then the heuristics is that it only improves things (it makes dom(f) more hyperbolic). If the problem is not due to a ramification point, then it there is an asymptotic value, and again this leads to many patches: in some sense, it is even more hyperbolic than just having ramification points. If $f$ is transcendental and some D$_i$ has only finitely many islands, then close enough to the boundary of dom(f), it is a bit like there is no islands. By the discussion above other preimages will be ramified, or worse. Now if there are enough D$_i$ with this property, then the game is to see that, on a purely combinatorial level, there must at least an exponential growth of the patches (this is idealistic but this gives an idea): this is what happens with the two examples above. Let us look at an example that works not: cos(z). Its critical points are points of $\pi\mathbb Z$, half of which get mapped to -1 the other half to 1. There is no asymptotic value (in fact, infinity is). The number of patches (whatever that means) grows linearly with the combinatorial distance. More precisely if you take D$_1$ and D$_2$ two disks about -1 and 1, their preimages are all ramified of ramification number=2. Join them by a line. Then the preimage of this picture is many disks-like domains at all the points of $\pi\mathbb Z$ all joined to the next by a line. This graph is more "euclidean" than "hyperbolic". Now if you have three domains D$_i$, take a point outside and link this point to each D$_i$ by disjoint curves, giving a Y-shaped picture with three disks attached at the tips. Ideally, the preimage of this graph contains (infinitely) many copies of this Y-shaped curve with disks at tips and to each of these disk (with finitely many exceptions) is attached at least two distinct copies of a Y. Such a graph is necessarily hyperbolic. Again, I do not know the proof of Ahlfors' theorems, and I completely forgot the proof of Bloch's theorem, so all this may be far from the actual proofs. This is just my point of view on things. 

This question arose from a problem in Niven & Zuckerman's book "Introduction to the Theory of Numbers". In the chapter that the authors introduce the mobius function, the first exercise is the following: Find a positive integer $n$ such that $\mu(n)+\mu(n+1)+\mu(n+2)=3$, i.e, $\mu(n)=\mu(n+1)=\mu(n+2)=1$. A brute-force aproach reveals the solution $n=33$. My question is simply: Are there infinitely many $n$ in the previous conditions? I really don't know how to aproach this problem. I tried various things (factorials, chinese remainder theorem, etc.) and i didn't come up with nothing. Also, for the first thousand numbers, there are the solutions $n=33,85,93,141,201,213,217,301,393,445,633,697,869,921$. One can also think in the variation of the problem with $\mu(n)=\mu(n+1)=\mu(n+2)=-1$ or simply $\mu(n)=\mu(n+1)=1$. Thanks in advance! 

All of these observations are straightforward to prove (I will give details if necessary). It might help to know that the center of $A$ is $Z(A)=k[x^p,y^p]$ and that $ad_q$ is a derivation (i.e., it satisfies the Leibniz Rule). Also, if I'm not mistaken, the following formula is valid: $ad_q(h)^{n}=\sum_{k=0}^{n} (-1)^k {n \choose k} q^k h q^{n-k}$ $\forall h \in A$. Hence, if $q$ is good, there exists a $p^j$ such that $0=ad_q(h)^{p^j}=hq^{p^j}-q^{p^j}h=[h,q^{p^j}]$, so $q^{p^j} \in Z(A) = k[x^p,y^p] $. I would be satisfied if someone had any hint or idea on how to attack this problem. Thank you! PS: I don't usually post on MO, so I apologize if I made any mistakes or if this question is not appropriate for this website. 

To be more precise I am interested in questions similar to the one below (I asked the question below on math.stackexchange last week but got not answer.) I have a $C^1$ function $f:[0,1]^2 \to \mathbb{R}$. The arclength of the graph of $f_y:x\mapsto f(x,y)$ is $$L(y)=\int_0^1 \sqrt{1+\left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}(x,y)\right)^2} dx$$ Deriving under the integral does not seem to be possible since it would involve a crossed derivative $\partial^2 f/\partial x\partial y$ whose existence is not assumed. Hence I do not expect L to always be a $C^1$ function of y. But so far I have not been able to find a counterexample. This question must have been already looked at. Any idea? 

Two questions were asked Concerning question I: Here's an application for my favorite bijection! Consider R the group of reals with addition and its subgroup Q of rationals. The group R mod Q has the same cardinality as R does (I guess you need the axiom of choice here). Let $\phi$ be a bijection from R mod Q to R. Let $f^t$ be the conjugate by $\phi$ of the translation by t in R mod Q. For all $t \in Q$ and all $x \in R$, $f^t(x)=x$. Concerning question II: (Corrected from my previous wrong claim) For X finite, then your assumptions imply that all $f^t$ are the same map and are a projection (a solution $p$ of $p\circ p=p$). In particular, your claim is true if $X$ is finite. Proof: let $n=|X|$, and notice that $f^t$ is for all k>1 the k-th iterate of a map $g:X\to X$ with $g=f^{t/k}$. Apply this to $k=n!$. I claim that $g^{n!}$ is a projection. Indeed consider any $x\in X$. Its orbit by $g$ consists in a tail of length $a\in\{0,\ldots,n-1\}$ followed by a cycle of length $b\in\{1,\ldots,n\}$, and $a+b\leq n$. So $g^{a}(x)$ has period $b$ dividing $n!$. As $n!\geq a$, the point $y=g^{n!}(x)$ is also a $g$-periodic point of period dividing $n!$, so it is fixed by $g^b$. Since $b$ divides $n!$, the point $y$ is fixed by $g^{n!}$. This proves the claim. Hence for all $t$, $f^t$ is a projection. Now consider two positive reals $s<t$. Then $f^t=f^s\circ f^{t-s}$ so the image of $f^t$ is contained in the image of $f^s$. But the image of $f^t$ is the same as the image of $f^{t/k}$ for all $k$ because the latter is also a projection. Since there is some $k$ so that $t/k<s$, we get that the image of $f^s$ is contained in the image of $f^{t/k}$ i.e. in the image of $f^t$. Since projections are characterized by their images, we are done.
