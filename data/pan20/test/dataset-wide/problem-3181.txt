As stated by others this is not really true. Even though shorter and less bloody compared to those in Bosnia and Croatia, the 10-day war outbroke in Slovenia between Yugoslav army located in the province and Slovenian police forces. To answer your question: the reason perhaps lies in the fact that Slovenia had ethnically clear picture with majority of Slovenians living within its border, i.e. the Slovenian border encompass Slovenian people quite fairly. On the other hand, Croatia had around 20-25% Serbian population when the war escalated in 1991. Bosnia had even worse mixture of three ethnic groups: Muslims 40% (nowadays called Bosniaks to distingish them from Bosnians which might refer to all people in Bosnia and Herzegovina), Serbs 40% and Croats 20%. These numbers are out of my head and might not be as accurate but rough approximations. Of course mixed marriages and people declaring as Yugoslavians were present all around the ex-Yugoslavia and especially in Bosnia. 

Added 05-25-2017. I have found another alleged Descent from Emperor Louis III to Emperor Henry VII but it also has one or two uncertain identifications. Emperor Louis III (882-928) Son of Ermengarids and Boso. King of Provence 890. King of Italy 990. Crowned Emperor 901. Captured and blinded by Berenger in 905. Louis continued to reign in Provence, but Count Hugh of Arles ruled. Louis was betrothed in 900 to Anna, Daughter of Emperor Leo VI, and perhaps married her. Louis married 902/05 Adelais. $URL$ Charles or Charles Constantine (905/10-962) Count of Vienne. $URL$ Richard (d. 962 or later). Son. Childless?$URL$ Hubert. (died 962 or later) Brother, son of Charles Constantine. Possibly identical with Humbert Count of Belley. In turn Humbert Count of Belley might possibly have been the material uncle of the ancestor of the Counts of Savoy. $URL$ $URL$ Adelais sister of Humbert Count of Belley and thus possible daughter of Charles Constantine. Possible mother of Humbert I Count of Maurienne and Chablis, ancestor of the Counts of Savoy. $URL$ So we will trace the heirs of the Counts of Savoy as possible heirs of the Carolingian emperors. Humbert (970/75-1047/51) Possible descendant of Charles Constantine. Ancestor of Counts of Savoy. Count of Maurienne and Chablis. $URL$ $URL$ Amedee (995/1000?-1051) Son. Amadeus I Count of Maurienne and Chablis. No surviving children. $URL$ Burchard (995/1000?-1068) Younger brother. Archbishop of Lyon. Childless. $URL$ [Odo (1017?-1060) Younger brother. Count of Maurienne and Chablis 1051, Margrave of Susa] $URL$ Count Peter I of Savoy (1047/49-1078) Margrave of Susa. Son. $URL$ Amadeus II Count of Savoy Margrave of Susa. (1048/50-1080) Brother. $URL$ Count Humbert II of Savoy (1072-1103) Son. $URL$ Adelaide (1092?-1154) daughter. Married King Louis VI (1081-1137) the Fat of France.[$URL$ Louis VII (1120-1180) King of France. Son. $URL$ Marie of France (1145-1198) daughter. Married Henry I (1126-1181) Count of champagne.$URL$ Empress Marie (1174?-1204) Daughter. Married future Emperor Baldwin I of Constantinople (1171-1205). $URL$ Margaret II (1202-1280) Countess of Flanders and Hainaut. Daughter. Married first Bouchard d'Avesnes (1180?-1244). $URL$ Baldwin of Avesnes (1219-1295) Son. $URL$ Beatrix d'Avenes (d. 1321) daughter. Married Count Henry VI of Luxemburg (1250?-1288) $URL$ Emperor Henry VII (1274-1313) Son. $URL$ See also post number 36 here: $URL$ Bu this all depends on if Hubert son of Charles Constantine is the same person as Humbert Count of Belley and if the sister of Humbert Count of Belley was the mother of Humbert Count of Maurienne and Chablis, ancestor of the Counts of Savoy. Return to original post. It is possible that any descent from any Carolingian, not merely Emperor Louis III, would suffice to satisfy the original question, As you can see by looking at the ancestor chart of Emperor Henry VII, most of his ancestors came from the Benelux countries or neighboring regions of France and Germany. The Counts of Louvain and later the Dukes of Brabant, heirs of the Carolingian Kings of France, intermarried with noble families in that area. $URL$ Charlemagne, King of the Franks and Lombards and "Great Peaceful Emperor Governing the Roman Empire", was the father of Emperor Louis I, whose sons included Charles II the Bald, King of the west Franks (or of France) and Emperor, father of Kin gLouis II the Stammmerer, father of King Charles III the Simple, father of King Louis IV from Overseas, father of (his younger son) Duke Charles (953-991) of Lorraine, rightful heir of France. Duke Charles of Lotharingia/Lorraine was the father of Gerberga (975?-after 1018) who married Lambert I Count of Louvain. $URL$ Gerberga and Lambert I were the parents of Lambert II Count of Louvain. $URL$ Lambert II, Count of Louvain (died 1062) had a son Henry II, Count of Louvain. $URL$ Henry II, Count of Louvain (died c. 1078) had a daughter Ida who married Baldwin II of Hainaut. $URL$ Their children included Baldwin III, Count of Hainaut, father of Baldwin IV, father of Baldwin V. $URL$ Baldwin V was the father of Baldwin VI who became Latin Emperor Baldwin I of Constantinople in 1204. $URL$ Emperor Baldwin's daughter Countess Margaret II was the mother of Baldwin of Avesnes who was the father of Beatrice of Avesnes, the mother of Emperor Henry VII. So I was able to find one of Emperor Henry VII's no doubt many descents from the Carolingians in just a few minutes of online research. Emperor Henry VII was also son of Count Henry VI of Luxemburg, son of Margaret of Bar, daughter of Philippa of Dreux, daughter of Count Robert II of Dreux and Yolanda of Coucy. Yolande of Coucy (died 1222) was the daughter of Raoul of Coucy and Agnes of Hainaut. $URL$ Agnes of Hainaut was the daughter of Baldwin IV, the son of Baldwin III, the son of Baldwin II and Ida of Louvain, one of the children of Count Henry II of Louvain, descendant of the Carolingian kings of France. $URL$ So a few minutes of research finds another descent from the Carolingians. By an interesting coincidence I have recently been investigating a pedigree claiming that Emperor Henry VII and his Luxemburg Dynasty was the heir of the Ottonian Dynasty and the Ottonian Dynasty could be considered the heir of the Carolingian Dynasty. But descended from Emperor Lothaire I's son King Lothaire II of Lotharingia instead of Emperor Louis III. Look for "The Carolingian Legacy" here: $URL$ Posts number 12 and number 14 in this thread in Historum discusses the alleged heirship of Emperor Henry VII. $URL$ In it I conclude that Emperor Henry VII was not the senior heir of the Saffenberg counts, and that I have not yet found any genealogical link between his Saffenberg ancestors and the descendants of Emperor Otto II. It is my opinion that since for almost five hundred years the head of the Hohenzollern Dynasty was the rightful heir of the Kings and Emperors of Emperor Henry VII's Luxemburg Dynasty, some supporter of the Hohenzollerns decided to make their ancestry even better by digging up or inventing genealogical links that made them the allegedly rightful heirs of the earlier Carolingian and Ottonian Dynasties. ............................................................................. 

Signing the pact with Germany by Yugoslavia didn't take an easy path. It took months of negotiations and tweaking which finally ended up on March 25th, 1941 when the treaty was signed. Only two days later, well-known March 27th took place overthrowing the regent Pavle and bringing 17 year old King Peter to reign, at least formally. British intelligence had a high level of involvement in this event as they desperately needed more enemies of their main enemy - Hitler. Only few decades before Serbs which constituted majority of Yugoslavian population at the time were fighting bloody war with Austro-Hungarians and Germany and it would have been quite unlikely for Serbs to take Hitler's side in the war. Weeks later Nazis bombed Belgrade and then penetrated into Yugoslavia with little or no resistance. While having great ovations while marching into capitals of Slovenia and Croatia, no such a treatment took place in Belgrade. Once Yugoslavia was conquered by Nazis, there were many militant movements involved in the conflict. Just to name few major ones: Yugoslav Partisans, Royal Chetniks and Croatian Ustashe. As some movements collaborated with Nazis, others were fighting them, and some did both, it is hard to talk about Yugoslavia as one entity during the war. 

The enlisted soldiers in European armies before the French revolution were mostly third estate lower class. Most of the officers in most European armies before the French revolution were second estate upper class. That is the general rule. Every society had its own twist and variation on the basic social classes. And every armed force had some variation in the class composition of the various ranks. Thus: 

$URL$ When Lady Jane Grey (c.1537-1554) was made Queen regnant of England in 1553 making her husband Guildford Dudley (c. 1535-1554) king consort was considered, but there wasn't time in her short reign. Queen Mary I (1516-1558) married Philip II (1527-1598), son of Emperor Charles V in 1554. The Emperor gave Philip a couple of his spare kingdoms and Philip became king consort of England. The title of Philip and Mary in England was:

Pavel Mif by all Chinese accounts was a ruthless scheming Napoleon (the one in animal farm). Fortunate to the Chinese, Mif was later purged by Stalin. I wonder what sort of family he was from; where he was raised, etc. 

Zhang Guotao in his memoir recounted his meeting with Shumyatsky in 1921. The then King of Siberia was very busy but managed to treat Zhang with a private dinner in his home. After the dinner, Zhang wondered why Shumyatsky ate so well in the deep of a famine. Zhang's companion (Wedensky?) said something to the effect that equality must not be held absolutely because some comrades carried greater responsibility. Zhang replied, "Lenin eats only 3/4 pound of bread a day. How come Shumyatsky eats better than Lenin?" Needless to say, Zhang, then 24 years old, was socially impaired, and Shumyatsky's hospitality produced the effect quite the opposite to what he had intended. Nevertheless, Shumyatsky's character is interesting and revealing. I wonder if there are detailed biographies on this person. 

Our dating system(s) are not based on astronomical events. They are based on astronomical cycles. Studies over thousands and thousands of years using more and more accurate instruments has refined scientific knowledge of the length of various astronomical cycles such as the day, the month, and the year. Thus calendars are designed to be accurate about the length of natural astronomical cycles. Thus the old Roman calendar was replaced by the Julian Calendar that started on 1 January 45 BC, and the Julian Calendar was replaced by the Gregorian Calendar in which Thursday, 4 October 1582 was followed by Friday, 15 October 1582. In most dating systems the years are numbered from the years of various historical events, not astronomical events. And this is the very briefest of summaries in answer to your question. 

A desirable coat of arms is one that is very simple and easy to remember. It is also desirable to have a coat of arms that is unique, different from everyone else's. But that was always hard to achieve. A coat of arms with a lion rampant of a single color on a field of a single color was very popular in early heraldry. But since there are only 2 metals and 5 main colors in heraldry and a rule against putting a metal charge on a metal field or a color charge on a color field, there were only about 20 simple combinations available. Possiblities are: A field of silver, with a lion either red, green, blue, purple, or black. A field of gold, with a lion either red, green, blue, purple, or black. A field of red, with a lion either silver or gold. a field of green, with a lion either silver or gold. A field of blue, with a lion either silver or gold. A field of purple, with a lion either silver or gold. And a field of Black, with a lion either silver or gold. So those possibilities soon ran out. Even kings often did not adopt coats of arms quick enough to snatch up an unused simple combination of a lion rampant of a single color or metal on a field of a single color or metal and had to settle for more complex designs. Royal coat of arms of Norway. $URL$ Royal coat of arms of Sweden. Note that the quartering of the Folklunga or Bjelbo dynasty with a lion rampant has it on a 2 colored field. $URL$ $URL$ The coat of arms of Denmark doesn't even have a lion rampant. $URL$ $URL$ The lion rampant in the Scottish coat of arms soon acquired a double tressure flory counter flory. $URL$ The Royal coat of arms of England, which does not have one lion rampant. $URL$ The royal or princely coat of arms of Gwynedd or Wales. $URL$ The royal coat of arms of Leon: $URL$ The Royal coat of arms of Cyprus: $URL$ It is the third quarter in the coat of arms of Cyprus, barry of eight argent and azure (silver and blue) with a lion rampant gules (red): The royal coat of arms of Lesser Armenia: $URL$ It is the third quarter in the royal coat of arms of Cyprus, a gold field with a red lion rampant. And the royal coat of arms of Dalmatia: $URL$ Has three lion faces. And the royal coat of arms of Bohemia: $URL$ Other medieval European kingdoms did not use lions in the royal coat of arms, such as France, Portugal, Castile, Navarre, Aragon, Sicily, the other Sicily, Croatia, Hungary, and Poland. Thus it is obvious why the lion rampant in the coat of arms of Bohemia has a forked tail to make it look different from other medieval lions rampant. And that goes for the lion in John de la Pole's heraldry also. 

According to Zhang Guotao, Nanchang Upgrising (01Aug1927) was Li Lisan's initiative inaugurated and proposed by Zhou Enlai to Zhang GuoTao. The decision to go ahead was made between Zhou Enlai and Zhang Guotao in the name of the Standing committee of CPC (中常委). Zhang admitted that this was the first important decision made in the absence of Moscow's endorsement. Two months later when Zhou and Zhang were still in the jungle, both men were demoted by CPC Central Committee headed by Qu Qiubai in Shanghai. I wander what the CPC's organizational hierarchy was like during this period. Who was supposed to take orders from who? Source: Zhang, Guotao. The Rise of the Chinese Communist Party.

In 1917, Cheng Fangwu and his friends were openly anti-Japan; yet in Japan they were free to elect whatever major they liked. Cheng studied steel making, guns, ballistics and torpedoes but later decided that military science was not going to save his country because his countrymen were still in "a deep slumber" - indifferent to military defeat and territorial loss. Cheng and his friends later abandoned their pursuits in science and embarked on the new culture movement. 

Allegedly, the king Alexander Karadjordjevic, the unifier, was offered to choose between Yugoslavia (called the kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes) or greater Serbia which would have been smaller than Yugoslavia, but definitely greater than Serbia alone at the time and nowadays. The offer was made by Allied forces, mostly Britain. He chose Yugoslavia, as he probably didn't care about the country's name but its size. IMO, had the Greater Serbia been created instead, the 20th century history of Balkans would have been quite different. $URL$ This offer is often quoted by some Serbs, but I didn't find any references. 

Yes! One can argue that the differences on that matter not only existed between the different military groups (Partizans - allied 100%, Ustashe - Nazis 100%, and Chetniks - 50/50), but also between the constitutional peoples Slovenes, Croats and Serbs. In order to illustrate my point one should check videos of Nazis entering Ljubljana, Zagreb and Belgrade - the capitals of Slovenia, Croatia and Serbia. While in the first two Nazis were celebrated as liberators, Belgrade didn't make Nazis such a warm welcome. 

The opposite view holds that extra-human dynamics govern the courses of events. This is a recurring theme of Tolstoy's War and Peace, a fundamental principle of Marx's dialectical materialism; it is also regurgitated by Jared Diamond in his Guns Germs & Steel. People who believe in governing dynamics would argue that the Renaissance was caused by draught in over-populated central Asia, which drove the nomads westwards, who overran Constantinople and flushed out books and scholars to Italy, where, upon contact with these ancient intellectual stimuli, the Italians reignited their interests in learning, which in turn started a rapid progress that lasted more than 500 years till this day. However, people who believe in great individuals would ask why Byzantine, for a thousand years and with all these books and scholars, had been stagnant. One reasonable answer is that Byzantine had books and scholars but no great men; Italy, on the other hand, had great men, but no books. 

Because nationalist Russian historians liked to claim that it was the end of the Tartar Yoke, even though it was not exactly the end of the Tartar Yoke It is possible that the Tatar Yoke did not finally end for two centuries after the standoff on the Ungra River, gradually becoming weaker and weaker. And one could claim metaphorically that the Tartar Yoke continued until the February 1917 revolution, now being enforced by Russian rulers to benefit themselves. The reasons given by Semaphore and T.E.D. for considering the standoff on the Ungra River the end of the Tartar Yoke are strong. Another reason for claiming that is Russian nationalistic pride. Proud Russians would like to claim that that Tartar Yoke was lifted as soon as possible, regardless of historical accuracy. Thus one may wonder whether the standoff on the Ungra River really was the end of the Tartar Yoke or if Russian historians jump the gun claiming that it was. I note that Alatoo's deleted answer says: the Tatars ran away and Russians just left after the Tatar threat was gone. Wikipedia says:
