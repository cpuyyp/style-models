In 'The Basic Problems of Phenomenology' Heidegger describes two types of being: the existence of things perceived is one type, and such things are extant beings; but there is also the existence of the perceiver, which is a qualitatively different type of being, (transcendental). Heidegger called this the ontological difference. The quotes below are from Basic Problems, on the terminology of 'real' in Kant :- 

Society naturally divides into authoritarians and liberals. The reason is, everyone starts out as authoritarian, following instruction from parents and teachers. (Authoritarian does not mean being bossy or socially dominant (SD); it means following authority.) Later in life, upon entering adulthood, some people self-actualise, individuate, start thinking more independently, become free-thinkers. (The process is a difficult wrench because the automatic follow-the-leader instincts and peer pressure have to be wrestled with.) People who are free-thinkers tend to let others get on with their own thing: a generally liberal attitude. Authoritarians generally stick to their chosen authority base. Professor Bob Altemeyer devised a psychological test to measure right-wing authoritarianism (RWA),. He managed to get US politicians to take the test, the results from which are shown below, (and here, page 201). The scoring showed that the right-wing tended to cluster to their authority-bound attitudes while the left were more distributed across the spectrum, following their own ideas, however varied they were. 

OP: I think that if animal actions are considered morally neutral, then whatever action is instinctive would bound that demarcation Animals and primitives are held back from morality not merely because they act instinctively but because they are not stirred to imagination. As described further in the following quotes from Jacques Derrida's Of Grammatology (1967). The Economy of Pity 

The simple answer to your question is that if something is governed by the scientific method, it is a science. If not, it might be a philosophy, but you are likely to find people who will argue both that it is and that it is not, since all definitions of philosophy, including yours that it is "knowledge generated purely by reason," are controversial. The fact that they can consider the same object, however, is not necessarily problematic. Both a chemist and a physicist can consider a substance like water. That doesn't mean they are practicing the same discipline. Both an anthropologist and a theologian can study a religion, that doesn't mean they are practicing the same discipline. The subjects that are first considered by philosophers often go on to become sciences, when they reach a point where they can be considered in a systematic and experiment governed way. That's arguably where all sciences originally come from --unproven philosophical theories that go on to gain scientific support. 

Not all philosophy is equally impenetrable. Modern academic philosophy is very hard to read because it is entirely aimed at a graduate+ level academic audience. In contrast, classic philosophy was often aimed at a general(ish) audience. It can still be difficult, depending on the lucidity of the writer, and how different their cultural context was, but it doesn't require the same level of prior knowledge. Of course, the concepts themselves are still often difficult to wrap your head around, but that's the whole work of philosophy. If you go back before the current era, you'll find that the primary sources in philosophy are often considerably more accessible than the commentaries. The commentaries tend to assume prior scholarship, and almost inevitably push their own assumptions and interpretations, which can muddy the waters rather than make them more clear. Plato's work is all written to communicate directly with different segments of his audience. It isn't hard to read in a good translation, although the unfamiliar cultural context can be baffling at times (as can Plato's uncompromising Idealism). Taken together, his Republic and Symposium are the foundational key works of all Western philosophy. Descartes' Meditations are quite short and very clearly written. I personally dislike Hume, but he's easy to read (and has a wicked sense of humor) once you get used to the old fashioned style. The literary work by Sartre and Camus is compelling just as literature, in addition to its philosophical merits. Kierkegaard is more poetry than prose, if you can get past that, he's a good read. Lao Tzu is elliptical and aphoristic --that's apparently a core feature of the Chinese language --but not hard to read (in a good translation). Ecclesiastes is very accessible. (Conversely, Hegel and Wittgenstein and to a lesser extent Kant and Aristotle, are notoriously hard to read, while Confucius is obscured by an excess of culturally specific references.) 

Here is a relevant link and quote contrasting instrumental reason with substantial reason. As you say, practical efficiency can be simply instrumental. The moral qualities of reasoning require a higher order. Max Horkheimerâ€™s Critique of Instrumental Reason and the Domination of Nature 

The mode of being of a non-living object is referred to as being extant. To be extant means it has been observed (or deduced) by an existing, sentient observer. The difference between extantness and existence is called the ontological difference. Extantess is a two-way process. Without the observer the unobserved 'thing' has no concept, no definition. Nevertheless, all unobserved things can be deemed to be extant under the group of 'unobserved things' - which we can safely say there are. it is I am Despite sharing the same verb, to exist, the subjective existence of a living person is of a different order from that of an observed thing. That's where the mystery begins. Edit Judging by your update, you are concerned with extantness. So consider the existence of a tachyon. The concept of a tachyon has been established as a seemingly possible thing. However, no one has found one yet so it 'is' still just a mere concept. One might suppose that if tachyons exist but no people had ever existed the tachonys would continue to exist. However, there would be no concept of tachyon - no discrimination of one part of reality from another - so how could a 'tachyon' exist? Thus objective existence (extantness) is the interaction between observer and object. 

A fallacy is not a moral judgment, it is a technical judgment. A fallacy is just an argument where the conclusion doesn't have a valid logical relationship with the premises. A morally exemplary person can still commit a fallacy, and the worst person in the world could still have impeccable logic. In the same way, being a hypocrite doesn't make a person's arguments wrong --it merely means she isn't practicing what she preaches. If an obese person lectures you about your drinking, and you reply "what about your eating?" that may be personally satisfying, but it doesn't invalidate any correct points he has made about your situation. No accidents of his person change the validity of his arguments --for better or for worse. What if (to use a less loaded example) a friend you know to be habitually broke tries to sell you on a new investment? In this case you can make a strong argument that if the investment was good, your friend would already be rich, therefore the investment is probably not good --that is not a fallacy. On the other hand, if that same friend tells you to save more than you spend, it's still valid advice even if he himself isn't following it. The two situations are superficially similar, but they are not the same. (The force of most informal fallacies stems from the fact that they are easily confused with similar situations that do provide the basis for strong arguments.) 

To answer the meta-question first: For purposes of this site, questions that deal with primarily with physics are probably most usefully handled by the physics stack-exchange, both in terms of reaching the experts best able to answer them, and in terms of being found by other users with similar questions. In terms of the broader philosophical question of whether physics is philosophy: Philosophy is the mother of the sciences, and many disciplines, not just physics, had their origins within philosophy. Once a discipline, however, gains a well-defined methodology and objective decisioning standards, it is no longer a philosophy. There still may be valid philosophical questions just outside the boundaries of what physics can determine, but from a quick survey of your questions, it seems like many of them dealt primarily with things that physics likely has a defined answer to, or at least a theoretical way to reach a defined answer. 

As far as I know you cannot go superluminal. It just seems that if the speed of light is 299,792 km/s then you just have to go a bit faster to go superluminal. If you are a photon travelling from the sun at the speed of light then your 'matter' is frozen against the speed-of-light limit, and your local time is stopped. Even though an observer on earth has to wait 8 minutes to see you, you are zipping across the universe in no time as all as far as you are concerned. Your arrow of time disappears at light-speed, (and certainly doesn't reverse if you go faster -- which you can't anyway). 

You may find it useful to consider the "excessive pursuit of perfectionism" to be a form of repetition compulsion. This originates from the most basic life drive: tenacious problem solving with the aim of mastery of one's environment. (All forms of life have to manage their environments to survive.) This Life Drive (Derrida, To Speculate - On Freud) or Will to Power (Nietzsche) is very basic and unconscious, hence it can run away from conscious control. In a positive light it makes for hard-working tenacity and, for example, enjoyment of crossword puzzles. In a negative light it can get out-of-control manifesting in obsessive compulsion. The main thing to note is that the behaviour is driven by a powerful, unconscious, instinctive drive, and this is what conscious rationalization has to curb and bring under control to a reasonable level. An unconscious drive is ordinarily invisible, but by being aware of its presence and origin it can be consciously brought under control. 

There are two possible ways of interpreting your question --as referring to non-verbal praying, or as referring to not praying at all. Either way, the most typical answers would be a) through the writings or traditions of your religion, b) through the agency of trusted religious figures and/or members of your religious community or c) through some form of direct communication from God to you. Most religious people operate through some combination of these three. You might further ask how you might validate the guidance you receive, but that's a separate question. 

The famous mathematician and philosopher Blaise Pascal had a theory that belief follows action --if you act as a believer, you gain faith ($URL$ --note the section marked "Inability to Believe"). It seems likely that he found this to be true in his own life --certainly theologically, and perhaps as a scientist as well. As far as (other) scientists and innovators who have believed in their theories before the evidence arrived to confirm them --it seems fairly obvious that belief in unproven theories is common. Those whose theories are later confirmed are celebrated as visionaries, those whose theories don't pan out are dismissed as cranks. If there wasn't a certain base willingness among people to occasionally step out on faith, the ability of humanity to advance would be severely curtailed. 

One approach to this issue hinges on an ambiguity in the term "insentient." We would typically take this to mean "less than sentient" --a chair is insentient. However we might speculate that God would be "more than sentient" in ways it might be difficult for us to conceptualize or understand. If I understand you correctly, you're taking sentience as a minimal necessity for agency. However, it might be that whatever the Godlike analogue of sentience is can also fulfill that necessity.

No, the concept of evil does not impinge on atheist philosophy. In a non-religious context evil can be regarded as originating from, for example, psychopathy, sadism, pathological narcissism. Furthermore, where leadership is psychopathic and/or paranoid conformity and authoritarianism can cause evil - or pathological disfunction - to spread into wider society, (since those not conforming to the pathological worldview would be endangered). 

Incidentally, in this video - The Astonishing Simplicity of Everything - Professor Neil Turok treats the many worlds theory with some scepticism and faint disdain. 

In line with robert bristow-johnson's comment, the only time travel is at a local rate of 1 second per second. That goes for everywhere, because across the board everything only happens at one moment, (even if the local rates are different due to different gravity etc.) So time-travel in the science-fiction sense is a logical fallacy, and time-travel ethics would be a nonsense.
