It should be kept in mind that Scientologists understandably perceive this claim as an attempt to undermine the legitimacy of their religion by degrading it to a money-making scheme on the part of the Founder. So the claim is not exactly innocuous; it gets into religious discrimination (or justifying such) very rapidly. 

The claim should be broken up into pieces: Did Mr. Hubbard write or publish that the way to make a million dollars is to start a religion? Obviously not, or his writings would have been cited, but that's fairly obvious and not really helpful. Did Mr. Hubbard state verbally (publicly or privately) that the way to make a million dollars is to start a religion? The page you have linked cites essentially all available evidence that he did. All of it, of course, is hearsay and hardly conclusive one way or the other, as you correctly pointed out in your question. It is worth noting that the page you cite, while it does mention evidence (dueling affidavits) counter to the conclusion reached, has failed to examine all available sources regarding German courts' actions in respect to the claim: 

There is another statement he's made about money and Dianetics that I've encountered before which remains elusive just now; I'll add it if I come across it. 

My own conclusion: I do not believe L. Ron Hubbard ever made such a statement, though I would believe it of many of his contemporaries. The evidence is sketchy, and I don't even think he particularly cared about money, based on examination of his writings and stated opinions. The motivation for those originally making and repeating the claim appears to me to be disparagement without particular concern for accuracy. 

The evidence so far, while it might be enough to discourage litigation-shy publishers from making the claim, isn't definitive, of course. It still amounts to, "He said ____," and "No he didn't." We can, however, go a little further in this by examining some of L. Ron Hubbard's relevant statements on the nature of religion, Scientology and money. I would expect to find evidence of such an attitude expressed directly or indirectly, if the original claim were true. While not directly evidence for or against the claim, these statements are given to assist the reader in evaluating the likelihood that L. Ron Hubbard made a statement about earning money by starting a religion. In other words, these are evidence relevant to the question: Did L. Ron Hubbard believe or act upon the idea that the way to make a million dollars is to start a religion? In a interview carried out by writing and published in Rocky Mountain News February 20, 1983, L. Ron Hubbard wrote: 

It could be argued that many of the finds suffer from selection bias (if you can find a connection to the Bible, you are more likely to publish a find than not). But that does not make the evidence go away, it merely lowers our expectation that new evidence will crop up in the future. Whether these Biblical characters are consistent with outside history is hard to know since the independent evidence mostly records their names and positions. Most historical records from the time are uninterested in describing the character of historical figures. At most, we receive broad accounts of their actions and those do seem consistent with the Biblical sources, for what it's worth. There is also evidence of New Testament characters to be found in Roman and Jewish records. I didn't find a list as condensed as the one for the Hebrew Bible, but this site includes not just independent sources for Biblical people, but also the political, social, intellectual, and cultural climate in which early Christianity was formed. If the list were compiled it would be fairly long, but I'd like to point out the unusual case of Gamaliel, who is well-regarded in both Jewish and Christian traditions. We are quite dependent on Josephus for most of our history surrounding Judea leading up to and through the destruction of the Temple. He has gotten a bad name in recent years because his mention of Jesus (the Testimonium Flavianum) was "punched up" by some later scribe to be more favorable to Christianity. A 1971 discovery of an Arabic copy of Antiquities does not include as many Christian interpolations suggests the passage is not entirely spurious. Peter Kirby has written a pretty good survey of research surrounding the passage. On the other hand, references to other Biblical characters such as James, the brother of Jesus, and John the baptist are more commonly accepted. Of course, references to various officials who also appear in the Bible are not contested at all. Jesus himself is of course well-attested in Christian sources, but also receives mention in non-Biblical texts. Not surprisingly given the antipathy of almost everyone to the early Christians, the non-Christian sources sharply contradict the Biblical account of his character and the meaning of his life. A list of New Testament figures associated with archeological finds that match the above criteria include: 

Definite scam! Save up to 50% on your electric bill? Because of a device plugged into any outlet? Uh, no. Here's PG&E with a warning about "black box" energy savers: $URL$ In the last few years I've noticed a huge "surge: :) in scam "electricity saver" products. Some are PFC capacitors, some are plans for "free energy" devices, some are ripoffs involving solar panels. Yours is just one of many, although this is the first time I've seen a claim that a surge protector can affect your KWH meter. And if it's actually a voltage regulator, then it needs to be wired into your fusebox panel. A regulator needs a series connection and cannot work by being plugged into an outlet. Similar topic: The old standby scam is to sell capacitors to homeowners, claiming that the AC motors in their appliances need correct power-factor. The scammers can get away with this because PFC power-factor correcting does actually save energy. Unfortunately the saved energy was all in the utility company power lines, not inside the home. The electric company will love you if you spend hundreds of bucks on a PFC capacitor. Their power lines run slightly cooler, and their generators use slightly less fuel. The higher current all remains between the capacitor and your various motors, so electric company is happy. But the scam part relies on customer ignorance: your KWH meter cannot detect the change. That's part of its design. Power-factor correction has zero effect on your KWH meter, so it won't actually save you a dime. If you buy a fake "Power Saver," probably you'll see your electric bill actually go down. This is an interesting psychological effect: spending that much money makes you become waste-conscious about the electric utility. You'll start turning off lights, taking shorter showers, running dishwashers only when full. Doing all sorts of things to help reduce the bills. When it actually works, should we give credit to the magic scam box? Send testimonials to the advertisers? Instead try installing the device in someone elses' home, then don't tell them about it. Will it still work? Better yet, have a 3rd party do it without telling anyone which house has the device. To stop everyone from unconsciously helping it along, the only fair test is a double-blind experiment. Well, actually the fairest test is to use high-precision real-wattage recorder to measure home energy consumption with the device attached and with it removed. We all have one of these: the electric meter outside the house. Run your electric clothes dryer, hook up the "power saver" device, then count the rotations of the meter disk for exactly one minute. Then unplug the device and count them for another minute. Repeat a few times. Can you see any difference? If so, is it large enough to justify the purchase price of the device? One "power saver" does actually work. These are the NASA "Nola" devices used to control induction motors (for example, refrigerator motor.) They remain controversial because they're mostly used industrially, and the energy savings is probably too small for any homeowner to justify buying the expensive controller. If someone tries to sell you one, they're probably lying about the expected amount of energy savings. 

The data seems to have come from a publication of the Cato Institute titled "Terrorism and Immigration: A Risk Analysis". The paper's appendix includes "Table A.1. Identified Foreign Persons Who Attempted or Committed Terrorism on U.S. Soil, 1975-2015", which seems to be the source of the claim. The table does not list country of origin, which makes verifying the claim somewhat time consuming. However, startling fact is that the 9/11 attacks make up the vast majority of foreign-born terrorist murders in the United States for that period. Those men were from Saudi Arabia (15), the United Arab Emirates (2), Egypt and Lebanon. The chart in split deaths in a single attack evenly across all perpetrators. So each of the 9/11 hijackers was listed as causing 157 fatalities. That would produce this chart: 

I found a rather extensive and well referenced list of Old Testament historical figures in this article. It lists 61 people, most of whom are identified in the records or monuments of non-Hebrew civilizations, or on archeological finds such as seals and signet rings. Included in the commentary before the list are three criteria for inclusion: 1) The name of the person must be found in some independent source. 2) The name must have a clear connection to a Biblical story. (A seal with the name Baruch may not be connected since many Baruchs may have existed, but "Baruch son of Neriah" found both in the Bible and and on a seal would likely be connected.) 3) The context (especially in chronology) of the evidence must fit with the context of the Biblical story. The article further argues: 

All of these are non-Jewish officials who left monuments recording their names and titles that fit the Biblical accounts. It also seems that Luke, the author of the earliest church history, had good knowledge of the rather intricate use of official titles in that period. None of this should be surprising, however, since all canonical New Testament texts were written within 70 years of the events they describe. It seems unlikely that the authors would need to (or even be able to pull off) inventing characters from whole cloth to fill out the stories. More difficult is finding compelling archeological evidence for Jewish personalities—partially because Jerusalem was fairly effectively destroyed by the Romans in 70 AD and partially because most of the Jewish characters mentioned in the New Testament were unremarkable except for their connection to Christianity. (It seems unlikely that we would have any independent record of a Galilean fisherman, for instance.) Even so, a number of ossuaries (bone boxes) have been found with New Testament names. Few of them can be connected to a Biblical character according to criterion #2 above and those that have are in dispute according to criterion #3.
