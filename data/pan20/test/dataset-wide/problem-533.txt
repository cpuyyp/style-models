I recently bought a MTB with Hydraulic Disk Brakes, and am finding really hard to adjust with the braking system. From the very beginning I was cycling with Front brakes on right hand. But now its reversed, and its really confusing me a lot. I asked my mechanic about this and he says front brakes on left hand are European Style of braking. So I should get used to it. But, why exactly are brakes reversed on such bikes? And to add up, my mechanic claims that the brakes cannot be switched. Is this true or, am I just being punked? 

My suggestion would be don't buy a full suspension at first (it will give far too much comfort with no skill). A good bike with lockable front suspension should be good enough to start. Learn to use you legs on bumps, and pits, then try locking your front suspension and learn to use your hands as suspension. A smooth sea never made a skillful sailor 

I've gotten back into riding fairly recently. I used to ride a bicycle a lot when I was younger - the single-speed, steel-frame deal with coaster brakes. I'm now riding a Fuji hybrid. When I was younger, standing to pedal was the thing to do. However, now when I do it, I can't really sustain it for more than four seconds, literally; my quads ache and I feel as though I have absolutely no endurance for this. This happens not only on hills, but on flat as well. Sitting to pedal has been alright for the most part. I'm able to climb hills in low gear (even though I'm really not good at it yet) and I can pedal well on flat ground. Standing is just a different story, as it takes it out of me so incredibly quickly that it's an almost useless technique. Am I doing something wrong? Might I need to adjust my handlebars to be higher or something? (My saddle is at a correct height, but perhaps when I stand, I'm having to lean too far forward to keep my hands on the bars?) Or is this common and it's something I'll just need to get over with practice? Don't get me wrong - I know that these things do come with time - but it doesn't seem to make sense that I get tired standing to pedal even on flat ground... Thank you. 

On my commutes, local bus are really a threat to me because they will force a cyclist out of way if they have to. On such conditions, overtaking/riding in your own way, being safe depends on you and your skills to tackle such situation. 

I suppose most of the people have noticed it. While adjusting both front and rear derailleurs, it will shift accordingly, when you have adjusted or are adjusting it, but when you test it by riding, the adjustment fail to perform the same way, Why does this happen? How does the added weight affect the shifters? 

Serioulsy speaking this Depends on how often you ride, and when you do how long and how far you ride? If you ride often and ride somewhere between 20-25 Miles every time, I don't think you have to worry at all. Just make sure, on the last two days you are well rested and have maintained good protein diet. If you ride occasionally, then its better to go on some regular practice ride and gain some stamina and endurance. Also, if this is a competitive ride, then going on a 35-40 miles ride about 3 4 days to familiarise yourself with the road and to plan your ride is a good option too. 

Issues of where to find a bike have been answered pretty thoroughly here, including the standard disclaimers of making sure a bike isn't stolen before purchasing. On advice for how to see how ride-worthy a bike is: Definitely take a look at the bike before buying. Give it a quick once-over for general wear or use. If the bike looks like it hasn't been maintained well, it will probably show. This doesn't mean it isn't a good bike, but you want the best you can get. If you don't see any obvious signs of mis-use, check each system more thoroughly. Keep in mind that this is not an exhaustive list, and that you will find problems with any bike if you look closely enough. It doesn't automatically mean you should look for a different bike either. What's important is whether the problems you find are evidence of deeper issues, or if they will cause problems in the future. Many issues can be fixed at home with a little effort, but it's still better to be aware of anything before you buy a bike. These small fixes can also add up if you're looking for something cheap. I'll try to point out bigger problems that you want to avoid. History: Simply ask if there have been any problems with the bike. Has it been in an accident? was it rebuild? does it pull the left? How long has the seller owned it, how much have they used it, etc. General: Does anything squeak or make unusual sounds? Can you stand comfortably over the frame with your feet flat on the ground? Does the bike still have reflectors in the front and back, the wheels, and pedals? Has the bike been registered previously, and can the owner produce the paperwork to transfer the registration? Do the parts have a well-greased and smooth feel to them? Wheels: Look for wear on the tire tread. Is there any damage to the side walls of either tire? What kind of conditions are the inner tubes in? As how many flat repairs each wheel has had, and if either tire leaks air significantly. Make sure the wheels attach firmly to the frame, and that the wheels remain secure when you torque them relative to the axle. (You don't want any 'play' in the wheels, as this may be a sign of one of those deeper problems with a loose cassette or worn ball bearings.) How are the spokes? Do they have relatively even tension on them and look like they're in good shape? Spin the wheel on the bike, and look down the thread for any wobbling or mis-alignment. If they do, the wheels could probably use a re-alignment. Brakes: Check the brake pads for wear. Will then need to be replaced soon? Are they aligned for proper contact with the braking surface? Do they engage quickly when the brakes are applied? Cables: Check for any frayed ends or rusted sections. Are the cable guides still in place and preventing unnecessary wear across surfaces? Do the cables have end-caps on them to prevent future fraying? Pedals: Do the pedals appear to have struck the ground before or they otherwise in good shape. Torque the pedal arms against the axle to see if there is any looseness. Spin the pedals by hand to ensure they rotate smoothly, but aren't too loose or tight. Also spin the pedal crankshaft to look for the same types of things. As with the wheels, being overly tight or loose at the axle may be signs of bigger problems. Gears and Chain: Visually inspect the gears for any wear (each tooth should be symmetrically shaped, not wave-shaped). Is each gear parallel to each other on the cassette? How does the chain look? Has it been well maintained and lubricated. This is probably the only part where you would need any equipment to check your bike, but a chain-wear tool would be useful to check for a stretched chain. If you don't have such a tool handy, the aforementioned wave-shaped gear teeth are evidence of a stretched chain in need of replacement. Wave-shaped gear teeth mean the gears should be replaced also (not usually a good sign). Does the gear switching mechanism allow you to reach the highest and lowest gear, and does it move well? Handlebars: How are the handlebars positioned relative to the seat. Are they within comfortable reach? Can you reach the brakes quickly. Are the handlebars in line with the wheel? Is the tape worn and cracked, or does it look like you will still get some mileage out of it. Do the handlebars turn smoothly in the frame with the wheel, or is there any tightness or looseness? Seat and Post: How does the seat feel? can it be adjusted to a comfortable height and does it stay in place well. Quick-release adjustments can be a huge plus here. Frame: How does the frame look. Is it still in line with itself or has it been torqued or bent. Are there any signs of cracks or dents? Problems with the frame tend to increase in severity with use and affect biking efficiency as the frame degrades. Some light damage might be okay here, but be aware that a damaged frame can quickly become unusable. Ride the bike: Ride the bike for a short distance, switch through the full range of gears. Pedal hard, brake hard with both brakes (but don't let yourself fly over the handlebars), and turn a few times. How does the bike feel? This includes how the bike actually performs, and how well it feels for you specifically. Is the bike comfortable for you. If not, can it be adjusted so that it is? Take someone with you when looking a the bike. You never know who you might come across through Craigslist, and two sets of eyes may notice more than just one. Best of luck 

I went on my first long bike ride yesterday - approximately 30 miles. (I know, it's cake to you grizzled road veterans out there, but I'm proud!) I had a great time and we took a fairly leisurely pace - approximately 10 mph or so. Lots of cycling and a lot of conversation. I didn't have any problems with energy or anything, but during the ride I was a bit sore in the saddle. Due to our pace, I was able to ease this a few times by standing in the pedals and pedaling infrequently. By the time we were getting back (the last mile or so) I was really feeling it, but today it seems to be okay. Overall, it worked well. I'm thinking that the soreness is probably just the symptoms of a longer ride (and me not being used to that). However, I figured I'd ask. How would I, as a relatively new rider, know when saddle soreness is caused by a bad (for me) saddle or bad saddle adjustment versus extended time in the saddle? Are there specific symptoms that I should be looking for? Edit: I'm looking for generalizations, as I know that specifics change with each rider and bike. An example would be something like, "if you have excessive soreness in your inner hamstring area, your seat may be too far forward", stuff like that. As it stands right now, I'm chalking this all up to the first ride, but I'd like to be knowledgable for future rides (and not ignore any potential warning signs I might miss). Thanks! (As a note, for anyone who might ask - I'm riding a Fuji Traverse 1.7. Everything's stock. I'm about 5'10", 5'11" with long limbs.) 

Still, another of problem most of the cyclist go through "Body Hairs". For guys with long hair all over the body, cycling is another way of punishing that guy (hopefully not me). Especially, the most problematic hair in my body are from thigh, they trouble be lot if not mitigated properly. I have tried shaving them, burning them (O.o) or other wild ways. What is the proper way to get rid of the body hairs from cycling point of view? 

One of the my colleagues is trying to trim down his weight through cycling. He is asking me what would be the best option for the purpose. I am no expert at this. But I need to know what will be best choices for it. This question is not just one question but many concerning one topic . Breaking down my question: 

I am not talking about the tools needed for the ride. I am talking about enduring and performing on long tiring tour. Grab a concept of a tour I recently went to 

Do not use a mis-matched internal geared hub for your frame. You risk damage to your gear hub, your frame, or both. Aluminum frames are much stiffer than steel frames, which is good for good for riding, but it is also prone to cracking due to this stiffness (when compared to steel's malleability). Even if you do fit the part, it will be a weak point in the frame. 

Most likely is that there is a weakness in your inner tube. Take the inner tube off the wheel and inflate it gently. If there's an area that bugles (especially if it's in the same location where your wheel bulges), that's probably the issue. If so, replace the inner tube. Something like this can happen as a result of a flat tire, or the repair of a flat. It could also be due to normal manufacturing variances that can take time to reveal themselves. Also possible is that the tire tread is damaged. Check for signs of wear or weakness in your tire's side walls, both inside and out. Also make sure that the tire bead (which 'grips' the wheel rim to hold the tire in place) is not damaged or worn. If it is, replace it, especially if it still bulges with a new inner tube. 

When riding hands free, I am noticing my bike is more oriented towards a particular direction (In my case: left). I tried to check of what my problems might be: 

I have watched many video clips on YouTube on this topic. Also, seen couple of pros do it without clipped pedals. But I just cannot lift the back tire up. How do you hook your feet on to the pedals and pull it up? The pedal slips and i always end up getting an seriously blow to the knee. 

Probably, another debatable question from my side. When carrying items while riding, like water bottle, repair kits, pumps, or other stuffs that you might need, What is the best option.... to carry them? 

On your cycle at saddle bag, handlebar bags, or pannier bags or etc. or, On backpacks, like hydrant pack, or simple travel pack. 

I can't find out what is causing them. Please tell me, What are things, steps and techniques needed to balance a bike.
