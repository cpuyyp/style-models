No. Minor note: I assume that your definition of irreducible includes not being divisible by an integer $>1$, so that $5x-5$ annihilating the all ones sequence is not an example. I'm going to show that the constant term of $f$ is $\pm 1$, since that lets me use power series in positive powers of $t$. Obviously, this is equivalent to looking at the leading coefficient by the symmetry $t \mapsto t^{-1}$. Suppose to the contrary that $f(t)$ annihilates the sequence $(a_i)$ and $f(t)$ is irreducible. Let $p$ be a prime which divides the constant term of $f$ but does not divide every term of $f$. Let $\mathbb{C}_p$ be the completion of the algebraic closure of the $p$-adics. The $p$-adic Newton polygon of $f$ has a line segment with positive slope, so $f$ has a root $\rho$ in $\mathbb{C}_p$ with $|\rho|_p<1$. Let $a(t) = \sum_{i \geq 0} a_i t^i$. Since the $a_i$ are integers, they have $|a_i|_p \leq 1$, and thus the sums converges for any $t \in \mathbb{C}_p$ with $|t|_p<1$. The condition that $f$ annihilates $(a_i)$ means that $f(t) a(t) = g(t)$ for $g$ a polynomial in $\mathbb{Z}[t]$ of degree less than that of $f$. In particular, $g(\rho)=0$. But $f$ is irreducible over $\mathbb{Q}$, so it must be the minimal polynomial of $\rho$, and $\deg g < \deg f$. This is a contradiction. 

The point of this answer, building on a comment by "so-called friend Don", is to point out that behavior has density $0$ among all quintic extensions. My guides here are the introductory portions of The geometric sieve and the density of squarefree values of invariant polynomials and Mass Formulae for Extensions of Local Fields and Conjectures on the Density of Number Field Discriminants, both by Bhargava. Let $k$ be a field. Recall that an etale $k$-algebra is a direct sum of finitely many finite separable extension fields of $k$. (We'll be in characteristic zero, so you can ignore the adjective separable.) We'll write $\mathrm{Aut}(K/k)$ for the automorphism group of $K$ preserving $k$; this is a finite group. Let $K$ be a degree $p$-adic extension of $\mathbb{Q}_p$ of degree $n$. As I understand the philosophy of these papers, the probability of that the $p$-adic completion of a degree $n$ number field will be isomorphic to $K$ is supposed to be $$\frac{p-1}{p} \frac{1}{\mathrm{Disc}_p(K)} \frac{1}{\# \mathrm{Aut}(K/\mathbb{Q}_p)}.$$ Moreover, these probabilities for distinct primes are supposed to be independent. For $K$ an etale $\mathbb{Q}_p$ algebra, we write say that $K$ has symbol $(f_1^{e_1}, f_2^{e_2}, \ldots, f_r^{e_r})$ if $K \cong \bigoplus_{i=1}^r K_i$ where $K_i/\mathbb{Q}_p$ is a field extension of ramification degree $e_i$ and residue field extension of degree $f_i$. A lemma in the Mass Formula paper (Prop 2.1) allows us to group together any place where we sum over the set of all etale $\mathbb{Q}_p$-algebras with a given symbol. So, our desired Euler factor is: The unramified extensions These are symbols where all the $e_i$ are $1$; namely $(1,1,1,1,1)$, $(2,1,1,1)$, $(3,1,1)$, $(4,1)$, $(5)$. We compute: $$\frac{p-1}{p} \left( \frac{1}{120} + \frac{1}{12} + \frac{1}{8} + \frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{5} \right) = \frac{p-1}{p}.$$ It is not a coincidence that the sum came out to $1$; see equation (2.4) in the Mass formula paper. The other symbols It is also okay to have symbol $(1^2, 1,1,1)$, $(1^2, 2,1)$, $(1^2, 1^2, 1)$ or $(2^2, 1)$. Each of these symbols corresponds to several possible etale $\mathbb{Q}_p$-algebras (for example, for $p$ an odd prime, there are $2$ ramified quadratic extensions of $\mathbb{Q}_p$, so $(1^2, 1,1,1)$ describes two options), but Prop 2.1 in the Mass formula paper means we don't have to think about this. I compute that the respective terms are $$\frac{p-1}{p} \left( \frac{1}{p} \left( \frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{2} \right) + \frac{1}{p^2} \left( \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} \right) \right)$$ Putting everything together, our Euler factor is $$\frac{p-1}{p} \left( 1+\frac{2}{3p} + \frac{1}{p^2} \right) = 1-\frac{1}{3 p} + \frac{1}{3 p^2} - \frac{1}{p^3}.$$ The point is that $$\prod_p \left( 1-\frac{1}{3 p} + \frac{1}{3 p^2} - \frac{1}{p^3} \right) =0.$$ Now, Bhargava's paper doesn't directly allow us to us the prudct in this manner because his best theorem, Theorem 1.3 in the sieve paper, only applies when, for all sufficiently large $p$, we include all the terms with discriminant $1$ or $p$. However, let $p_N$ be the probability that the ramification is as you wish for all $p < N$. Then Bhargava's Theorem 1.3 does show that $p_N$ exists and equals $\prod_{p<N} \left( 1-\frac{1}{3 p} + \frac{1}{3 p^2} - \frac{1}{p^3} \right)$. So this product is an upper bound for the probability that a quintic behaves as desired for all primes. Sending $N \to \infty$, we see that the proportion of quintics with the desired behavior is $0$. 

Let $$M=\begin{pmatrix} u_1 & u_2 & \ldots & u_n \\ v_1 & v_2 & \ldots & v_n \\ \end{pmatrix}$$ be a $2 \times n$ matrix. Define $\nu(M)$ to be the $k \times n$ matrix $$\nu(M) = \begin{pmatrix} u_1^{k-1} & u_2^{k-1} & \ldots & u_n^{k-1} \\ u_1^{k-2} v_1 & u_2^{k-2} v_2 & \ldots & u_n^{k-2} v_n \\ \ldots \\ v_1^{k-1} & v_2^{k-1} & \ldots & u_n^{k-1}\\ \end{pmatrix}.$$ This immediately descends to a map $\nu: G(2,n) \to G(k,n)$, by thinking of a matrix as its rowspan. EDIT Actually, as Sasha points out below, it only gives a rational map. The matrix $\nu(M)$ has full rank if and only if $M$ has at least $k$ pairwise linearly independent columns. I was talking to a bunch of physicists today who are interested in the cohomology class of the image of this map. Does anyone know of papers which look at this? In particular, if I understood them correctly, they have been computing the intersection of $\nu(G(2,n))$ with $G(k-2, n-4)$ embedded in the more normal way. (That is to say, we embed $G(k-2, n-4)$ into $G(k,n)$ as the space of $k$ planes containing a given $2$-plane $A$, and contained in a given $(n-2)$-plane $B$, with $A \subseteq B$.) Experimentally, the number of intersection points is coming out to be the Eulerian number $\left\langle \begin{matrix} n-3 \\ k-1 \end{matrix} \right\rangle$. For example, the intersection $\nu(G(2,6)) \cap G(1,2)$ inside $G(3,6)$ gives $4$. Has anyone seen this? 

You might also want to read Carlos Simpson's paper "Moduli of representations of the fundamental group of a smooth projective variety", parts I and II. He explains in great detail how to make the set of objects of each of these categories into the points of an algebraic variety, and why these algebraic varieties are analytically but not algebraically isomorphic. He doesn't use the category theoretic perspective much, as I recall, but he is invaluable for understanding how to work with concrete moduli spaces. 

The following counterexample is due to Higman; I learned about it from Terry Tao's blog. Consider the group with generators $a$, $b$, $c$ and $d$, and relations $ab=b^2a$, $bc=c^2 b$, $cd=d^2c$ and $da=a^2d$. This group is infinite (in fact, the subgroup generated by $a$ and $c$ is free), but it has no nontrivial map to $GL_{n}(\mathbb{C})$. See Terry's post, especially Remark 2, for a very nice exposition of this fact. 

Let $A$ be a symmetric matrix, with eigenvalues $\lambda_1 \leq \lambda_2 \leq \cdots \leq \lambda_n$. Let $B$ be the matrix obtained by deleting the $k$-th row and column from $A$, with eigenvalues $\mu_1 \leq \mu_2 \leq \cdots \leq \mu_{n-1}$. Then $$\lambda_1 \leq \mu_1 \leq \lambda_2 \leq \mu_2 \leq \lambda_3 \leq \cdots \leq \lambda_{n-1} \leq \mu_{n-1} \leq \lambda_{n}.$$ This is a special case of Cauchy's interlacing theorem. The operator $P$ in the wikipedia article should be taken to be the projection on the coordinate vectors other than the $k$-th one.
