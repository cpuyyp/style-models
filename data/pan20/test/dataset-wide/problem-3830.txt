The result is true, regardless of characteristic. Lemma: Let A be a k algebra and M a semi-simple A-module which is finite dimensional as a k-algebra. Then the image of A in $\mathrm{End}_k(M)$ is a semi-simple ring. So, by the Artin-Wedderburn theorem, this image is a direct sum of matrix algebras over division rings. Proof: Call this image S. Since S is finite dimensional, it is artinian. Let $M= \bigoplus V_i$ and let $t=(t_i)$ lie in the Jacobson radical of S. For each $V_i$, the condition that $V_i$ is a simple A-module implies that it is a simple S-module. So t must act trivially on $V_i$, and thus $t_i=0$. But we have proved this for all i, so $t=0$ and the Jacobson radical of S is trivial. QED. We can now reduce to the case that A=S, and is a direct sum of division rings. Say $A = \bigoplus \mathrm{Mat}_{n_i}(\Delta_i)$. So every A-module is of the form $$\bigoplus (\Delta_i^{n_i})^{k_i}$$ for some $k_i$ and the corresponding characteristic polynomial is $$\chi(\lambda, g) = \prod \chi_i(\lambda, g_i)^{k_i}$$ where, for $h \in \mathrm{Mat}_{n_i}(\Delta_i)$, the polynomial $\chi_i(\lambda, h)$ is the characteristic polynomial of $h$ acting on $\Delta_i^{n_i}$. A much better argument, suggested by buzzard's comment below. (I am not sure whether or not the original can be fixed.) Let $M = \bigoplus (\Delta_i^{n_i})^{k_i}$ and $N = (\Delta_i^{n_i})^{\ell_i}$. Suppose M is not a summand of N, so $k_i > \ell_i$ for some $i$. Let g be 1 on the i component and 0 everywhere else. Then the characteristic polynomials of M and N are of the form $(\lambda-1)^{n_i k_i} \lambda^{\bullet}$ and $(\lambda-1)^{n_i \ell_i} \lambda^{\bullet}$. So the former does not divide the latter. We just need to show that the polynomials $\chi_i$, as polynomial functions on $\overline{k} \times A$, are relatively prime to each other. This is easy enough. Let $t_a$ be a basis for the $k$-linear functions on $\mathrm{Mat}_{n_i}(\Delta_i)$ and $u_b$ a basis for the $k$-linear functions on $\mathrm{Mat}_{n_j}(\Delta_j)$. Then $\chi_i(\lambda, g_i)$ is a homogenous polynomial in $\lambda$ and $t_a$; while $\chi_j$ in homogenous in $\lambda$ and $u_b$. Their GCD must be homogenous in both ways, hence, it is of the form $\lambda^m$. But, if $\lambda | \chi_i(\lambda)$, this means that there is no $g$ which acts invertibly on $\Delta_i^{n_i}$; contradicting that the identity does so act. So the GCD is 1, and the result is true.

For those who have time to do some coding, the AMS releases tables of how many papers in MathSciNet land in each of the MSC subjects. This should be a more representative sampling of mathematical publications than the arXiv. Unfortunately, the format is a list of every paper, its year of publication, and which classifications it used, so it is not obvious to a human which subjects are the most popular. For those who don't have the energy to create our own table, David Rusin has a chart where the area of each MSC subject is proportional to the number of publications in that filed from 1980-2000. The classification is too fine to easily answer questions like "Is analysis more popular than algebra" and the time period is not quite what we want. But one can immediately see that any one of Statistics (62), Probability and Stochastic Processes (60), Numerical Analysis (65) and PDEs (35) all dwarf Algebraic Geometry (14), Category Theory (18) and even Number Theory (11). 

Sure, that can happen. G = PGL_2, H is the torus, X is the Riemann sphere, x is the north pole, y is some point other than the two poles. I've read that Kapranov paper recently, I'll see if I can find something more useful to say. 

Let $\Delta^{p-1}$ be the strategy simplex for the first player, and $\Delta^{q-1}$ for the second player. Let $P$ and $Q$ be the payoff functions for each player. Our goal is to understand those points in the interior of $\Delta^{p-1} \times \Delta^{q-1}$ which are Nash equilibria. Suppose that $(x,y)$ is an interior equilibrium. Now, $Q(x,y)$ is linear in $y$. The only way that a linear function can be optimized at an interior point is that $Q$ is constant as a function of $y$. The condition that $Q$ be constant as a function of $y$ is given by $q-1$ linear equations in the $x$ variables. There is also one more equation: $\sum x_i =1$. Similarly, requiring that $x$ be an interior optimum gives $(p-1)+1$ linear equations in the $y$ variables. If our payoff matrix is generic, then these equations are independent. We have $q$ equations in $p$ variables and $p$ equations in $q$ variables. If $p \neq q$, then one of these sets of equations will have no solution. If $p=q$, then there is one solution in $\mathbb{R}^p \times \mathbb{R}^q$. If it has positive entries, then it is the unique interior equilibrium. If some of the entries are negative, then there are no interior equilibria. Even without the assumption that the payoff matrix is generic, the subset of $\Delta^{p-1}$ where some linear equations hold is a polyhedron $K$. Similarly, the subset of $\Delta^{q-1}$ where some linear equations hold is a polyhedron $L$. So the set of interior equilibria always looks like $K \times L$. 

If $n=2m$, the answer is $2^{m-2} m! \binom{2m}{m} m^{m-2}$. Let $T_m = \sigma(n,m)$. We go through several transformations. We write $[n]$ for the set $\{ 1,2,\ldots, n \}$ and $[a,b]$ for $\{ a, a+1, \ldots, b \}$. $T_m$ number of fully matched trees on $[2m]$. $2 T_m$ number of fully matched trees on $[2m]$ equipped with a bipartite coloring. $\frac{2}{\binom{2m}{m}} T_m$ number of fully matched trees where $[1,m]$ is colored white and $[m+1, 2m]$ is colored black. $\frac{2}{m! \binom{2m}{m}} T_m$ number of fully matched trees on $[2m]$ where $i$ is matched to $m+i$. So we need to show that the last number is $2^{m-1} m^{m-2}$. Let $U$ be one of the objects counted by the last number, and let $V$ be the tree on $[m]$ obtained by contracting the matched edges and labeling the contraction of $(i, i+m)$ by $i$. We claim that every tree $V$ on $[m]$ has $2^{m-1}$ preimages under this map. Proof: To reconstruct $U$ from $V$, for every edge $(i,j)$ of $V$, we must choose whether to join $i$ to $j+m$ or $j$ to $i+m$. This is $m-1$ independent binary choices. $\square$ I don't have any good ideas about $n>2m$, but my basic ideas would be (1) see if you can use Hall's marriage theorem to give a simple description of when a matching is maximal (2) write some code to generate a table of values, and see whether it appears in Sloane's encyclopedia of integer sequences. Looking up a table in Sloane is a bit of a black art. You should try entering several different diagonals, entering individual rows forwards and backwards, looking up any other sequences that come up in restating the problem (for example, Sloane's doesn't list $T_m$ but it does have $\frac{2}{m! \binom{2m}{m}} T_m$). I'd also factor some of the large entries in my table; if all of the prime factors of $\sigma(n,m)$ are $\leq 4n$, it seems likely there is a product formula; if not, I'd bet against it. Hmmm, this might make a good blogpost....
