There are several reasons why quantum suicide is typically raised. The first is that the other interpretations are typically extremely unclear about how the world works and what exists in reality, see $URL$ As a consequence, they are unclear about how whether the terms that appear in equations correspond to reality, so it is difficult to say anything about what implications the theory has for anything. The second is that in the MWI everything that can happen does happen. People sometimes naively think this implies that literally anything can happen. But this need not be true. It may be the case that if you put a gun to your head and pull the trigger there may not be any universe in which you survive. 

An appeal to authority is never valid under any circumstances. An idea is either true or false. What is relevant to the idea is whether there are known criticisms, such as inconsistencies or clashes with experimental data. There is no privileged source of knowledge that always gives gives correct answers, or probably gives correct answers or anything like that. We can easily make mistakes when measuring something. We can easily make mistakes when interpreting something a person wrote. We can easily make mistakes when doing a measurement or making an argument. As such, every source of knowledge is fallible. Nor is there any way of separating right wrong arguments other than critical discussion. All sources of knowledge should be treated as fallible: no exceptions. See "On the sources of knowledge and of ignorance" by Karl Popper in "Conjectures and Refutations". The only rational way of dealing with a source is to explain its significance and to be prepared to defend its arguments. Citing a source as if it ends an argument is anti-rational. For more substantive guidance see $URL$ To put this another way. Authority is a social status, which has nothing to do with being right or wrong, and so is irrelevant to assessing a position. 

The role of a lawyers is to act as a mediator between his client and the legal system: $URL$ The client wants to get as much as possible out of his dealings with the legal system If he is making a complaint then he may want a lot of compensation or a long sentence to be imposed on the person who he is complaining about. If the client is on trial for committing a crime or tort or whatever then he wants to avoid punishment or compensation or whatever. There are also people like judges and jurors who are supposed to decide the case. The lawyer is supposed to advise his client about what he can reasonably expect to get and the best way to get it. A detailed discussion of the issue of how a lawyer ought to act is given in $URL$ and many similar articles. For example, a lawyer should advise his client that he should not perjure himself since it is illegal, immoral and he may be caught in a lie that could lead to his prosecution. However, if the client perjures himself the lawyer should not tell the court. The problem with telling the court is that it would undermine his oath of confidentiality. Without that oath the client has a reason not to disclose information that he thinks may be damaging and without that the lawyer may not be able to mount the best possible defence. 

The minimum wage worker is productive largely because somebody else provides him with facilities that enable him to be productive. The people who provide those facilities typically have a lot of very difficult decisions to make. The people who pay the decision maker presumably think that if they don't pay that sort of money, then they won't attract people willing to make that kind of decision who have any realistic prospect of success. If the minimum wage worker wants more money, then he should negotiate for it. Other people can't be expected to read his mind. Nor should they be expected to pay more to somebody when they are not convinced that it is a good idea. 

Hegel and Wittgenstein are difficult to read. Some people seem to take this as a sign of profundity. It's actually a sign that you haven't thought through your ideas well enough to write them down clearly. In addition, Wittgenstein makes many substantive and false philosophical claims about language and philosophy. These claims include the idea that philosophy is about correcting flaws in how people use language, and that many philosophical questions can be easily solved by refusing to say stuff. For criticisms of these claims, and of a load of bad methodology that goes along with them and is still popular among philosophers, see "Words and things" by Ernest Gellner and "Conjectures and Refutations" by Karl Popper Chapter 2. For good philosophy books about logic and maths see "Godel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid" by Hofstadter and "The Fabric of Reality" chapters 3 and 5-10 and "The Beginning of Infinity" chapters 5-8 by David Deutsch. 

Proving any statement is true or probably true is impossible, unnecessary and undesirable. This is true whether the statement is deemed to be philosophical or not. If you assess ideas using argument then the arguments have premises and rules of inference and the result of the argument may not be true (or probably true) if the premises and rules of inference are false. You might try to solve this by coming up with a new argument that proves the premises and rules of inference but then you have the same problem with those premises and rules of inference. You might say that some stuff is indubitably true (or probably true), and you can use that as a foundation. But that just means you have cut off a possible avenue of intellectual progress since the foundation can't be explained in terms of anything deeper. And in any case there is nothing that can fill that role. Sense experience won't work since you can misinterpret information from your sense organs, e.g. - optical illusions. Sense organs also fail to record lots of stuff that does exist, e.g. - neutrinos. Scientific instruments aren't infallible either since you can make mistakes in setting them up, in interpreting information from them and so on. We don't create knowledge (useful or explanatory information) by showing stuff is true or probably true for reasons so how do we create knowledge? We can only create knowledge by finding mistakes in our current ideas and correcting them piecemeal. You notice a problem with your current ideas, propose solutions, criticise the solutions until only one is left and then find a new problem. We shouldn't say that a theory is false because it hasn't been proven because this applies to all theories. Rather, we should look at what problems it aims to solve and ask whether it solves them. We should look at whether it is compatible with other current knowledge and if not try to figure out the best solution. Should the new idea be discarded or the old idea or can some variant of both solve the problem?
