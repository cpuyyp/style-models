Novelty is not a good criterion, people carefully prove their accepted facts all the time. And whether something is an accepted matter of fact depends on who you are. It is sort of a clue, but it is not a good deciding criterion. I also don't buy this distinction between arguments and explanations. But an explanation that is an argument uses data and logic to establish the fact that it describes reality or applies productively to a given range of cases. This text does not, it is simply a set of definitions and facts, without evidence. (So, in my book, it also is not an explanation, just an empty explanatory structure, which does not explain anything. Having a set of definitions that may or may not apply to reality has never made anything clearer. But that is to some degree quibbling.) I also disagree that looking for a conclusion is the right criterion. If there is argument, there is also an implied conclusion. But the conclusion may be omitted or unclear. "You never bring me flowers. You never sing me love songs. You hardly talk to me anymore when you come through the door at the end of the day." is an argument, but the conclusion is omitted. It is is an argument because it gives evidence, and not simple facts. It is meant to imply things and not just describe a state. The relevant issue is the matter of evidence and/or connecting logic. Arguments argue: they have a position to support or advance and they are using facts and logic to provide that support. 

Then there is a thread in Christianity of which you have never heard. Unitarian-Universalism ($URL$ and certain forms of (Hicksite) Quakerism (e.g. most of the Friends General Conference $URL$ are Christian sects that primarily interpret God as metaphorical, as do many forms of Liberation Theology (e.g. George Pixley's "God's Kingdom" $URL$ (These are traditional sects, the former arising out of Congregationalism, the second out of the crisis caused by the English split from Rome, and the latter out of Roman Catholicism proper. They are all established, and I would avoid @DanBron's characterization of any of them as 'New Age'.) They do not carefully outline their beliefs in contrast to theism, because they wish to accord respect to more traditional Christians. But the first of these sees God as the Universe (hence the name), and the latter two see God as a transcendental aspect of humanity (The Inner Light) or a process in human history (basically Marx's or Hegel's evolution). More broadly, this thread runs through a lot of individual Christians' beliefs, even if it does not qualify as orthodox part of most sects. If 'God is Love', that is a metaphor. And that is the basic framing for a lot of Liberal Christians, who may doubt or discard scripture and tradition, but accept an inclination toward morality that feels like it comes from outside them, even if they do not deeply believe that it does. They retain the practices that encourage that inclination, and reflection on the formational documents of European culture is included among those practices. 

People are probably not answering because this is not quite a redundant question, but the answer has been given many, many times here. You might want to start from the broader question of whether it is in fact possible to express all knowledge in discrete symbols at all, under any kind of interpretation. Godel's Theorems suggest not. Starting from the principles of First Order Logic, you can prove that any enumeration of all mathematical truths expressed in discrete symbols, given pretty much any means of interpretation at all, that includes the facts of arithmetic, is either incomplete, or contains contradictory information. Extending this to higher-order more self-referential symbolism doesn't help. Anything that qualifies has to be either unsound, incomplete or ineffective. Meaning it contradicts itself, it fails to be able to express something true, or you there are reasonable statements about which you cannot determine whether they are true or false. And that is just math. Many other domains of life reproduce math in its entirety, so none of them can be encoded this way. It is ambiguous whether you can conquer this with non-discrete symbols. But if you did, you would need a non-discrete version of truth values. So you would surely not be able to represent those with zeroes and ones. 

There have been long periods of time in every major philosophical tradition when philosophy has been carefully shaped to lie within a religious context. Hindu philosophy is clearly Hindu. Aristotelian philosophy between the time Greece left off leading the West, and the time it got back to Europe, was carefully cultivated in a way that would not offend Islam. Platonic and Aristotelian philosophy within Europe was carefully monitored and fitted into a Christian context from early on until the end of Scholasticism. And so forth. So, historically, there seems to be no basic clash between philosophy and religion, except over which should dominate the mindset of a period. Our own period is one that cannot see religion as a predominant force in shaping thought, but that is largely a post-Victorian phenomenon, restricted to the West. 

First of all, to demand moral action be consciously separated or refined in any way is simply prejudice against the stupid. If a human being is supposed to be capable of making as purely moral an action as an angel, with its much more highly developed intellect, if less consistently, then the stupidest human who still has any intelligence at all, should be able to be as moral as the most intelligent. Therefore, it cannot be necessary to know or understand the reason for a moral act, in order for it to be moral. The ultimate reason for acting, if it arises noumenally as noted by virmaior is still going to have phenomenal representations, and there is no reason why those representations cannot be sentiments. So the question is whether your sentiments are representations of duty, or whether they are completely tied to your own comfort. When it works, I do believe this is a discernment that even someone with limited attention can make, since one of the moral criteria is the very concrete means-ends one, and we are to trust that the moral criteria clearly identify duty. Even as quite young children we know when we are acting with respect for others, and when we are play-acting it. To the degree your motives are notably mixed, you are to some degree using people as means. [Being nice to your sister so mommy will be nice to you is not acting out of respect for your sister.] Absolute discernment in cases of mixed motivation is not truly necessary because, given the absolute isolation of thought from deeper meaning in the noumenon/phenomenon split, it is not possible. It becomes a chicken-egg problem -- which came first, the motive or the awareness that you will benefit? I, at least, can almost never tell. To my mind, this is consistent with a little bit of Calvinism that subtly inflects the Lutheran Pietism that Kant was raised with. To some degree, only God knows whether you are doing the right thing, but you get points for trying (even if all of those points have already been accounted before you were born, which kind of takes the payoff out of trying. But expecting a payoff is the wrong thing to do, anyway. And so on, back and forth endlessly.) Analyzing motivation is not pointless, because that itself is a moral act motivated by the attempt to be clear on one's duty. But in the end, you can't attain access to pure duty by thinking about it. You might be able do discern that your action is correct, but your understanding of your motivation is always clouded. 

It is weirder than that: The wave function actually represents the square root of a probability, to the degree that makes any sense. (The simplest mathematical contrivance modeling this is that a particle's mass is re^it where t is time. So it 'rotates' in complex space, and its energy and mass are split into real and imaginary components.) When you multiply two of them together, only then do you get a real number, a probability. The reason to consider the cat both alive and dead is the timing of the event of death. If the cat decides it is alive it will have been alive all along. And if it is dead it will also have been dead the whole time. Time passes for the cat as though the event were decided when the (as yet unresolved) cause, caused it. If you think of it as a probability, there is too much temptation to imagine the event would happen when the probability was resolved. But it happened already, whichever way it came out. It misses one of the distinctive characteristics of the paradox. So the framing explicitly rules out that way of thinking of it for effect. 

So most of us, at some level, really believe in either a 'Good' God providing possibility, or an 'Evil' God providing limitation, whatever form that God takes. To even imagine you are alone, seems to require being sure there is or was someone else. Why would that expectation come to be? How could a being that has always been alone miss company? The only way out of this is Sarte's "Hell is other people", or its cheery parallel, but that is just distributing the personality of the "Evil" God, and makes for multiple people. Put short, the fact that you reach out for others with worlds, suggests that you are constituted to do so, which lacks logic, if you are alone. That it is natural to project that other as a God does not imply the other creatures are Godlike in any way, but only that you are able to idealize from constituents, and that constituents of Otherness are there. So this is not, for me (as it was for the Gnostics) a proof of God, but a proof that the basic notion of Other has some deeper reality. 

(I am hoping to give a reasonably short answer by choosing a specific perspective, instead of attempting an overview.) Intuitionism was put forward as a way to address the problems people had with mathematical Platonism as they tried to formalize verbal logic. They found things like Russel's paradox were harder to evade than one might assume. And that dealt a deep blow to the ordinary, Platonic way of looking at the process of mathematics. Intuitionists pointed out that Platonism might be a result rather than the real cause of what goes on in the mathematical process. That mathematics is not about absolutely stable ideas, but that it seeks out those ideas for the use of the other sciences. One interpretation of Neo-Intuitionism is that mathematics is a real experimental science. It is the purest form of psychology. It experimentally determines what intuitive concepts humans cannot easily let go of once they have them, and how those concepts combine well or badly. So mathematics does not study some fixed realm of nature outside ourselves, it studies human thought and creative processes. 

Appendix To answer @Conifold's objection: In order to combine experiences and derive general principles at all, there has to be a mechanism to do so -- experience does not naturally correlate itself into rules -- we do that to it. Kant proposes the Categories, which are a bit audacious in their detail and specificity. In a more materialist vein, I would propose that mechanism is the inborn subjective emotional feeling of 'clarity'. There are is a kind of combination that is most clear, across the species, and the result is a given shared substrate of assumptions that underly and become logic and mathematics. (The feeling that this basis is shared, and that we should delve into the shared aspects of it is most obvious in our experience of musical melody.) This includes two deeply shared core sets of intuitions: 

Closed questions like "Would you lie to save someone's life?" force false dichotomies, in that they have simplified answers that do not consider all possible resulting actions. Often what you need to find a solution that respects everyone's autonomy is a creative solution you would never imagine because you have accepted the terms in which the problem has been framed. One of the positive aspects of Kantian ethics is that it does not believe in a real conflict between duties, so it encourages creative ad hoc solutions over choosing between two outcomes that only seem to conflict. In that spirit, the problem with choosing to lie to save someone is that everyone else exists, too. What if the reason someone is intending to kill those people is that they are carriers of plague, and you are lying to the CDC to protect them, they are likely to infect millions of others, who will die? Then some other way, like negotiating a voluntary quarantine, might save them and everyone else. Most likely, the person with the power to implement this alternative solution is someone who would never get the opportunity if you lied. Then lying to save them is not better than not lying. 

This is most succinctly captured in modern analytic terms as 'supervenience of the ideal upon the physical.' It is one form of 'emergentism' as a theory of mind, which identifies concepts as emergent phenomena of our social interactions (via Wittgenstein's language-games or some similar social construction), and therefore of our biological processes, which are ultimately physical processes. This perspective allows for the 'mind' (and in the process 'life') to exist and have contents, but only as a process entirely derived from physics, even though parts of it are not tractably reducible to the processes from which they derive. 

There is a difference between deriving from opposite points of view and actually being opposed. One can decide killing is wrong from an instrumentalist, rights (both particular) point of view: each individual has a right to more power over the direction of his future than any other individual, and from a communitarian, utilitarian (both universal) point of view: if we are all afraid of being killed all the time, that will cut into our overall ability to enjoy life. These arguments are dual in some sense -- they capture the same intuition in different terms entirely, but there is no conflict. In fact, in extreme cases, logical arguments that are stated in completely contrasting terms can not only not conflict, but can be identical. Consider the ways in which mathematical or logical theories can be dual -- the logic of propositions and the theory of sets are dual to one another. They capture the idea of assigning properties to things and rigidly using those properties to combine the information about them. Everything is the same, but every statement is almost perfectly opposite. If A is the set of things satisfying p and B is the set of things satisfying q then A and B combined (their union) satisfies the set of things that satisfy p or q separately, and so forth. Sets build the universe up out of particular elements and propositions carve it down into objects with properties. But at base, they are doing the same thing. Those sets may be universal and those properties may be individual names. But the viewpoints are still basically generalizing our feeling of extension on the one hand and our feeling of intension on the other. It can be argued that in the same way these two theories are dual, there is a dual formulation of every logical theory that starts from an exactly complementary point of view. Going back to the opening example, it captures this trend. It is almost impossible to motivate particularist rights and values theories from anything but our shared universal drives and wishes. And it is equally difficult to identify what drives and wishes may be shared, except through looking at the things to which people naturally take offense or extend appreciation -- the basic matter of defining rights and values. The viewpoints are opposite, but never opposed: the implications can be expected to agree to the degree that they are dual representations of the same content. (This is never perfect, even in math. The previous answer about the gaps and compromises between dual theories still applies. But I think it presumed this perspective, which was already lacking. So it was out of context.)
