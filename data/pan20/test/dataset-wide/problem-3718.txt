Yes, there is a way to guess a number asking 14 questions in worst case. To do it you need a linear code with length 14, dimension 10 and distance at least 3. One such code can be built based on Hamming code (see $URL$ Here is the strategy. Let us denote bits of first player's number as $a_i$, $i \in [1..10]$. We start with asking values of all those bits. That is we ask the following questions: "is it true that i-th bit of your number is zero?" Let us denote answers on those questions as $b_i$, $i \in [1..10]$. Now we ask 4 additional questions: Is it true that $a_{1} \otimes a_{2} \otimes a_{4} \otimes a_{5} \otimes a_{7} \otimes a_{9}$ is equal to zero? ($\otimes$ is sumation modulo $2$). Is it true that $a_{1} \otimes a_{3} \otimes a_{4} \otimes a_{6} \otimes a_{7} \otimes a_{10}$ is equal to zero? Is it true that $a_{2} \otimes a_{3} \otimes a_{4} \otimes a_{8} \otimes a_{9} \otimes a_{10}$ is equal to zero? Is it true that $a_{5} \otimes a_{6} \otimes a_{7} \otimes a_{8} \otimes a_{9} \otimes a_{10}$ is equal to zero? Let $q_1$, $q_2$, $q_3$ and $q_4$ be answers on those additional questions. Now second player calculates $t_{i}$ ($i \in [1..4]$) --- answers on those questions based on bits $b_j$ which he previously got from first player. Now there are 16 ways how bits $q_i$ can differ from $t_i$. Let $d_i = q_i \otimes t_i$ (hence $d_i = 1$ iff $q_i \ne t_i$). Let us make table of all possible errors and corresponding values of $d_i$: position of error -> $(d_1, d_2, d_3, d_4)$ no error -> (0, 0, 0, 0) error in $b_1$ -> (1, 1, 0, 0) error in $b_2$ -> (1, 0, 1, 0) error in $b_3$ -> (0, 1, 1, 0) error in $b_4$ -> (1, 1, 1, 0) error in $b_5$ -> (1, 0, 0, 1) error in $b_6$ -> (0, 1, 0, 1) error in $b_7$ -> (1, 1, 0, 1) error in $b_8$ -> (0, 0, 1, 1) error in $b_9$ -> (1, 0, 1, 1) error in $b_{10}$ -> (0, 1, 1, 1) error in $q_1$ -> (1, 0, 0, 0) error in $q_2$ -> (0, 1, 0, 0) error in $q_3$ -> (0, 0, 1, 0) error in $q_4$ -> (0, 0, 0, 1) All the values of $(d_1, d_2, d_3, d_4)$ are different. Hence we can find where were an error and hence find all $a_i$. 

(The second or the fourth coordinate can be deleted in the example, to get an example with only five coordinates. I am not sure whether that is smallest possible). 

Here is a lower bound of $2^{\Omega(2^n)}$ for the number of unimodular triangulations. Let me start with the triangulation described by Włodzimierz Holsztyński, which is indeed quite classical and I will call the standard triangulation of the $n$-cube. Its $n$-simplices have as vertices the $n!$ monotone paths of vertices from $(0,\dots,0)$ to $(1,\dots,1)$. Observe that the standard triangulation $T$ has the following property: for each $2$-face of the cube, the two triangles in which $T$ divides that face have the same link (that is, they are joined to the same simplices). This implies we can perform a flip on that $2$-face: we can remove the two triangles in it together with all simplices containing them, and insert the other triangulation of the quadrilateral, with the same link as the old one had. (This is a higher dimensional analogue of changing the triangulation in a square pyramid, as described in David Eppstein's or TMA's answers) Now, if we find $k$ of these $2$-faces in which we can perform flips independently (that is, if no two of the flips affect a common simplex) then we get $2^k$ triangulations of the cube. One way to guarantee that the flips are independent is to use $2$-faces at the same level, by which I mean the following: every $2$-face is defined by $n-2$ equalities of the form $x_i=\epsilon_i$, where $\epsilon_i\in \{0,1\}$. I say a $2$-face has level $l$ if exactly $l$ of the $\epsilon$'s are equal to $1$. The number of $2$-faces at level $l$ is ${n \choose n-2}{n-2 \choose l}$ which, for $l\sim (n-2)/2$, grows as $2^n n^{3/2}$ (modulo a constant). Thus, we have at least $$ 2^{\Omega(2^n n^{3/2})} $$ unimodular triangulations of the $n$-cube. It is also easy to give a crude upper bound that is not that far from the lower bound. Observe that a unimodular triangulation is a set of $n!$ $n$-simplices taken out from a total of (at most) $2^n \choose n+1$ $n$-simplices. Thus, the number of unimodular triangulations (or, of all triangulations, for that matter) is at most $$ {{2^n \choose n+1} \choose n!} \le 2^{O(n^{n+2})} $$ 

There is an example of a function that is unbounded on every open set. Just take $f(n/m) = m$ for coprime $n$ and $m$ and $f(irrational) = 0$. I want to generalize this in a way to get a function which is not just unbounded on every open set, but whose range is equal to $\mathbb{R}$ on every open set. The latter construction clearly doesn't work. I'm interested whether such function exists and if it exists is there any constructive way to define it? 

Is it true that every positive rational number $r = \frac{n}{m}$ could be represented as sum of $\frac{1}{k}$ for different $k$'s: $$ r = \sum_{i=1}^{s} \frac{1}{c_i} $$ where all $c_i$ are different? If true, are there any bounds on number of summands $s$ based on $n$ and $m$? 

A positive answer to this question has just appeared in the arXiv: Tiling with arbitrary tiles; Vytautas Gruslys, Imre Leader, Ta Sheng Tan; $URL$ 

Finding the exact number of unimodular triangulations of a cube in higher dimension is, I would say, out of reach. In fact, I would say the number is doubly exponential in n (that is, exponential in the number of vertices). [Update: see my other answer for a doubly exponential lower bound] For dimension 3 I can reproduce David's count of 72 in a different fashion: Every unimodular triangulation of the 3-cube uses one (and only one) of the four diameters of the cube. So, it suffices to count the triangulations that use one particular diameter. For this do the following: if you project the cube along the direction of the diameter used, you see a hexagon. The vertices to which the diameter is joined in your triangulation must form a sub polygon of this hexagon with the center inside. There are 18 possibilities: 

Answer for the first question. Let $w_k$ be the product $p_{nk+1} p_{nk+2} \cdots p_{nk+n}$ where $p_i$ is $i$-th prime. So each $w_k$ is equal to product of $n$ distinct primes and $w_k$ and $w_q$ are coprime for $k \ne q$. Now take $t$ such that $t \equiv -k \pmod {w_k}$ for $k = 1, 2, \cdots, m$. Such $t$ exists by Chinese Remainder Theorem. Now $t + k$ has at least $n$ primes because $t + k$ is a multiple of $w_k$. Hence numbers $t + 1, t + 2, \cdots, t + m$ satisfy requirements in the first question. 

If we take $x_n = (-1)^n x$ then $x_n$ converges to $0$ in Cesaro sence. But no subsequence of $x_n$ converges weakly to $0$. $x_n$ is also a bounded sequence. Hence your statements seems wrong. 

The polyhedron inside the triangle is the Minkowski sum of the three vertices or, equivalently, the Minkowski sum of a vertex and the opposite edge. This gives: 

The answer is YES in the following stronger form: Lemma 1: Let $d>n$ and let $p\in dP\cap \mathbb{Z}^n$. Then there is an $i\in\{1,\dots, n\}$ and points $p'\in iP\cap \mathbb{Z}^n$, $p_1,\dots, p_{d-i}\in P\cap \mathbb{Z}^n$ such that $$ p = p' + p_1 + \cdots + p_{d-i}. $$ For the proof I will (as is customary in this type of problems) work on the cone over $P$, defined as follows: $$ C_P := \operatorname{pos}(P\times \{1\}) \subset \mathbb{R}^{n+1}. $$ Observe that $dP$ can be identified with $C_P \cap \{x_{n+1}=d\}$. I call height of a point in $C_P$ the value of its last coordinate, so that integer points at height $d$ are identified with integer points in $dP$. Lemma 1 is equivalent to: Lemma 2: Let $p\in C_P\cap \mathbb{Z}^{n+1}$ be an integer point at height $d> n$. Then, there is a point $p'\in C_P$ at a certain height $i\in \{1,\dots,n\}$ and integer points points $p_1,\dots, p_{d-i}$ such that $p=p' + p_1 + \cdots + p_{d-i}$. Proof of Lemma 2: There is no loss of generality in assuming that $P$ is a simplex (if not, consider an integer triangulation of $P$ and apply the result to each individual simplex). So, let $v_1,\dots,v_{n+1}$ be the vertices of $P$, considered as points in $C_P$ at height one, and let $Z$ be the unit parallelepiped obtained as the Minkowski sum of the segments $Ov_i$. The cone $C_P$ can be tiled by integer translations of $Z$; more precisely, it is tiled by all translations $v+Z$ where $v$ runs over the integer non-negative combinations of the $v_i$'s. Thus, $p$ can be decomposed as $p'+v$, where $p'$ is an integer point in $Z$ and $v$ is an integer non-negative combination of the $v_i$'s. Except in the trivial cases where $p'=O$ or $p'$ is the sum of all the $v_i$'s, the integer point $p'$ in $Z$ has height between $1$ and $n$, which finishes the proof. QED 

There are $\binom{n}{k}$ ways to choose $k$ elements from $n$ elements. If we consider their sum it is "expected" to be equal to every element of the field with the same probability. Hence we get $\frac{1}{q}\binom{n}{k}$ for the number of solutions of $x_1 + x_2 + \cdots + x_k = s$. This is the first part of your question. Now there are $\binom{q}{k}$ ways to choose $k$ different elements of the field. And $\frac{1}{q}$ of them have sum equal to $s$. In other words number of solutions of $x_1 + x_2 + \cdots + x_k = s$ is equal to $\frac{1}{q}\binom{q}{k}$. If we choose random $D$ with $|D|=n$ every solution will have all $x_i \in D$ with the same probability $p$: $$p = \frac{\binom{q-k}{n-k}}{\binom{q}{n}}$$ Hence the expected number of solutions is equal to $\frac{1}{q}\binom{q}{k} \cdot p$ which is equal to $\frac{1}{q}\binom{n}{k}$. So the expected number of solutions is equal to $\frac{1}{q}\binom{n}{k}$. 

Now that I think of it, my answer was wrong. I was just reproducing examples mentioned by the question poser (Bing's, as seen in Ziegler's book). These examples cannot be reduced keeping the boundary to be a 2-sphere, but the question is whether there are examples that cannot be reduced keeping the boundary a 2-manifold. 

Unless you have some additional structure on the points $A_1$,...,$A_n$ your problem is as hard (and as easy) as computing the convex hull of $2n$ points in $\mathbb{R}^n$, and triangulating this convex hull. EDIT: Neither the fact that you have zeroes nor the value of the determinant simplify the problem, as far as I can see. The way I think about your problem is as follows. Using projective coordinates, you have $2n$ vectors $(A_1,1),\dots, (A_n,1), (e_1,0),\dots, (e_n,0)$ in $\mathbb R^{n+1}$ and want to compute its positive hull and a triangulation (in the sense of vector configurations) of it. If you prefer to live in the affine world, you can multiply the last $n$ vectors by $d+1$ so that all your vectors (now points) lie in the affine space $\sum x_i = d+1$. In this sense, as I said in my original answer, your problem becomes that of computing a convex hull (Q1) and a triangulation (Q2) of $2n$ points in $\mathbb R^n$. If you are interested in arbitrary $n$ I think there is not much more I can say other than "use the general machinery". But if you are interested in small $n$ there are two things you can do to get a lower dimensional "picture" of your problem: 

Given a binary function $f: [1..n] \times [1..n] \to [1..n]$ how to check that this operation is a group operation on $[1..n]$? It's obvious that this can be done in $O(n^3)$ time just by checking all group properties. The most time-expensive property is associativity. Also it's clear that it could not be done faster than $O(n^2)$ time since you should at least examine all values $f(i,j)$. The question is if there is any algorithm to solve this problem in time faster than $O(n^3)$? 

It's well known that there are no non-constant polynomials with integer coefficients whose values at integer points are primes. Could this result be generalized to the case of prime powers? The question is whether there exists a polynomial $p(x) \in \mathbb{Z}[x]$ with degree at least one such that for all $x \in \mathbb{Z}$ $|p(x)|$ is prime power. 

Let me point out a very significant difference between dimensions 2 and 3. In dimension 2 ANY triangulation (Delaunay or not, random or not) has average degree strictly smaller than six (and going to six as the ratio "boundary points / interior points" goes to zero). This is a consequence of Euler's formula. In dimension three, however, there are triangulations (even Delaunay triangulations) with arbitrarily many points and a complete graph, that is, with average degree $n-1$ where $n$ is the number of points. What this means, in particular, is that the answer to the question may depend in how you sample. Going to a very degenerate situation, Amenta et al studied what happens when you sample uniformly on a (perhaps lower dimensional) polyhedron. 

Let me point out that this also admits a purely combinatorial proof. Consider your triangulated $S^n$ as the boundary of a triangulated ball $B^{n+1}$ (for example, but not necessarily, cone your triangulated sphere to a vertex in the interior of the ball) and extend your labeling of the vertices to the interior arbitrarily (in the example, simply choose a label in $\{1,\dots,n+1\}$ for the interior point). Now, each $(n+1)$-simplex $\sigma$ in your triangulated ball that uses all $n+1$ labels has exactly two $n$-dimensional faces $\tau_1$ and $\tau_2$ that use all labels, and $\tau_1$ and $\tau_2$ have opposite orientations when seen from $\sigma$. If you now count the pairs $(\sigma,\tau)$ that arise this way (with their orientations), the $\tau$'s intersecting the interior of the ball cancel out (they belong to two $\sigma$'s, with opposite orientations) so that in the boundary there must be the same number of them with one and the other orientation. (This proof is very much inspired in "Sperner's Lemma", which Sperner used to give a purely combinatorial proof of Brower's fixed point theorem)
