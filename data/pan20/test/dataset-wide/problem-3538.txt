Your BMI is 20.9, which is considered optimal-to-low. However, BMI is far from a perfect measurement of health, and is mostly useful for diagnosing extreme under or over weight. In your case, if you're visibly pudgy/fat, you probably lack lean body mass and have a high body fat percentage. For someone of normal BMI, body fat percentage, waist circumference and waist-to-hip ratio are likely to be more useful measures. Since your abdomen is thick, you probably have a lot of visceral fat, which is the absolute worst kind of fat to have. It's one of the main risk factors for metabolic syndrome and diabetes. As @informaticker mentioned in the comments, the fat loss advice is basically the same as for an obese/overweight person, but since you (probably) lack lean mass, strength training is especially important. You probably don't need to lose weight: you need to gain muscle/lean mass and lose fat. I'd suggest a high protein diet 

There's some good discussion of this in John Walker's book The Hacker's Diet. Here's a quote from a chapter called "The Rubber Bag". 

Should you switch to something less enjoyable but healthier? That depends on how much you enjoy it, and how integral to your habits this has become. If you find yourself "going to the gym so you can eat a brownie", then the brownie has probably become integral to your exercise as a reward for your workout habit. Exercising regularly is better for you than eating a few brownies a week, and changing habits is hard, so it's likely worth the tradeoff. Just make sure the brownies have natural ingredients: no partially hydrogenated oils, HFCS, etc. (Note: If you're trying to lose weight, you probably won't burn off as many calories in most workouts as the brownie.) If you're just looking for calories for purely utilitarian reasons, and brownies are a convenient way of doing that, switching to something healthier is a good idea in theory, though it's difficult to find foods that dense in calories. According to NutritionData, a 60g brownie has 240 calories, which as many calories as if it were made of solid sugar! Brownies have more calories per gram than heavy cream, and almost as much as triple-cream brie. Plenty of "energy bars" are that high in calories, but they're frequently not very good (and the ones that are good are pretty much just candy bars anyway). If you're looking for that density of calories, you're going to need to eat something that's either very fatty or very dry (or both): potato chips, fatty cheese, candy bars, buttery pastries, etc. None of it is likely to be very good for you, so go with something you like. Personally, I go for the triple-cream brie, but to each his own... 

There was a recent study suggesting that just the opposite is true. Generally exercise causes short term appetite increases. This study's results showed that if you ate something before exercise, your brain doesn't compensate for those calories as much as it should, so you end up eating more overall. 

Track your weight. There are various online tools for doing this. I use The Hacker's Diet, though I've heard good things about MyFitnessPal. I know it's depressing at first, but actually seeing variations over time as you make changes to your diet can get very motivating. Whatever you track is something you can affect. Many people keep food diaries and count calories, but I've never had the wherewithal to do that. Eat a high protein diet. This means lean meats and cheeses, eggs, thick greek yogurt, beans and lentils. Protein increases satiety (the feeling of fullness), and will help preserve lean body mass as you lose weight. Eat a low sugar diet. Anything that's sweet other than fruit is probably best consumed only sparingly, preferably not at all. This includes fruit juice of all kinds and pop. Get smaller plates and glasses. This makes the food that you're eating look bigger. Everyone is sort of on autopilot when we're eating, so the best place to diet is before it's on your plate. Or better yet before it's in your house. I try to keep all junk food out of my house. When I do decide to get junk food, it's really, really inconvenient, and I try to only buy as much as I'm going to consume when my resolve is weak. I learned this lesson the hard way when I was quitting smoking: all the cigarettes I brought home I would smoke in short order. A lot of people can have a few cigarettes when they're drinking and forget about it the next day. I'm not like those people. It's the same thing with junk food. Many people can eat a few chips and put the bag back in the cabinet. For many obese people, the bet that you can't eat just one is a sucker's bet. Monotony is your friend. Eating a monotonous, high protein, high fiber diet has made cutting back on calories so much easier for me. I eat oat bran and plain greek yogurt for breakfast. Every day. I eat lentils or black beans 4-5 nights a week. The monotony makes me want to eat less of the food overall, and the fiber and protein make it more filling. 

Here's a reasonably good set of beginning advice: webmd. I'd say there likely aren't any exercises which will be specifically good for the third lumbar vertebra, but building up strength in that area should generally help. Especially given that you're underweight, building strength/increasing muscle mass is likely to be helpful. I'd recommend crunches, the pelvic tilt/curl Pilates exercise, and several yoga poses: child's pose, planks/chaturanga, cat/cow poses, downward facing dog, and half (not full!) forward bend (modify by putting your hands on your knees instead of the floor if bending is too much). That's far from an exhaustive list of good exercises to do. In general, I think you want to be strengthening your abdominal muscles, your psoas muscles and your latissimus dorsi, so try to find exercises that strengthen those muscles. (Note, I am neither a personal trainer nor a medical professional, just someone who's had a lot of back pain. If the pain persists or gets more severe, seek professional help!) 

The main issue with losing weight through exercise is that your body has mechanisms for counteracting calories burned through exercise. That means that those extra calories you burn from the increased metabolic activity of muscle are likely to be precisely compensated by increases in appetite and decreases in your metabolism. So unless you're rigorously counting calories, you're likely to eat more, and not lose any weight at all. (Of course any exercise is likely to make you healthier.) What you need are activities and lifestyle changes to alter your body mass set point, making your body "want" to be thinner. There's some evidence that you should focus on High Intensity Intervals Exercise/Training to maximize fat loss. This small study found that the following (SSE means something like standard "cardio"):
