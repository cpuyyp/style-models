It was clicking awfully and louder, when on load. The bike shop changed the freewheel. It started creaking softer, still would click at fast speeds. The bike shop changed the pedals, bottom bracket. Nothing happened, it was still the same if not worse. I started playing with the rear cassete and derraulier, it got better for a little while; it got fixed the day it rained, somehow. Creak/click is coming back, I found a way to replicate the load, and it replicates the sound, definitely the cassette; even grabbing the casette and rotating it with your bare hands makes the same sound; I was not strong enough with only one hand to do it in the video. 

What do you think it is? should I complain for the 7th time in the bike shop but this time tell them exactly what it is? anyway the more information the better, so at least I can talk with property. Here's the video where I show my homemade attempt. 

So I recently bought a trek marlin 7, mostly to commute to work, nothing rough so far, and this week when I'm going uphill specially, or downhill, or accelerating; sometimes is downright random, it makes two click noises, once per pedal stroke click, click, then click, click... weirdly sometimes it throws three click cl... click! two for the first stroke and one for the second stroke. I'm getting pissed because the worst is that I can feel them in the pedals, and I don't know if it's going to blow up at some point and throw me out the bike, specially when I'm going fast. But it happens randomly and rarely, however quite audible. I checked the derailleurs to the brakes and the seat, nope, the sound occurs in any gear. But this bike is fairly new, will it be covered by the warranty? I'm broke now after I bought it. 

The only way that interrupter levers could make much of a difference is if the installation requires extra housing (which would compress under braking, increasing the lever travel for a given braking pressure). If you're not bottoming out the levers, though, that's not the source of your problem (and from the picture I don't see why the interrupters would require additional housing anyway). I think Daniel R Hicks is correct here--your lever/caliper setup likely isn't giving you enough mechanical advantage. You're squeezing the levers as hard as you can, but you're just not getting enough pad/rim force for decent stopping power. You notice this mostly in wet weather because there's less pad/rim friction when they're wet. Finger positioning on the levers is one thing that can make a difference--keep them as far away from the pivots as you can. On my drop-bar commuter bike, for example, I need to ride in the drops during wet weather because I just don't get enough mechanical advantage with my hands on the hoods. You might also see better braking performance if you switch to softer brake pads, or rain-specific pads like Kool-Stop Salmon or similar, though I've read that the Salmons tend to chew up rims pretty quickly when it's dry. 

Road tires with no obvious defects can definitely lose 10 PSI per day--there just isn't a whole lot of air volume so the tiniest leak through the tube or the valve will drop the pressure in a hurry. Moral of the story: check the air pressure every time you take out the road bike. 

Vacuum cleaner with an adapter down to Schrader size? Pumps usually have valves to avoid pulling in air. You do not need a hard vacuum, just a minor one. A little gross, but if you do not mind, you could use the vacuum device god gave you. Use a valve tool, remove the valve stem, and then just suck the air out? Probably taste icky, but I would not imagine it would be dangerous. (Taste of the air, vs anything else). A valve stem tool can be faked with a pair of narrow tweezers. The valve stem itself has the pin in the center of a rectangular piece. You just grasp two sides and twist to unscrew. Here is one on Amazon for $0.39! (Haha! And $7 in shipping! Talk about adding insult to injury...) 

In my personal experience, anything you wear while riding that is even moderately water proof will trap heat and sweat and for me, I will end up just as wet if I had ridden with or without the jacket. GoreTex and the like are just riding an edge of being helpful. Short rides, cool temps, perfect. Long rides, doesn't matter, you are going to get wet. From the inside or the outside. :) 

Even if you do not go as far as different rims, consider different tires. Slicks (1.25") vs the regular tires (2+ inches) will make a huge difference, and usually can be found for $30 a tire or so in the US or Canada. Beyond that, remove unnecessary hardware. Front shocks are probably the worst thing you might have on the bike. I do not know if it is worth considering a hard fork just for this race or not. 

Proper size is definitely important--it's not a good deal, no matter what the price, if it doesn't fit you. In my experience, top tube length is the one that's most important to get right. There's a bit of latitude for adjusting the reach to the bars by changing stem length but this will change the handling dynamics so you don't really have more than a couple cm of adjustment. Adjusting the reach by moving your seat forward or back isn't really an option. The seat positioning should be largely determined in relation to the pedals. If the seat's not positioned properly with respect to the pedals, I feel like I'm constantly sliding forward or backward as I ride. In your case--compare the FP2 geometry specs to your current bike, or take a ride on a bike with similar geometry. You can also try an online fit calculator, competitivecyclist.com for example, to give you an idea of what size you should be looking at. In the end, there's no substitute for actually riding the bike in question, though some fit problems only become apparent after an hour or more on the bike. Looking at the FP2 geometry, the top tube seems long-ish for the nominal size, and the sizing chart seems to run a little big. As an example, I'm 5'8" tall and generally prefer about a 54-55 cm top tube. Therefore, I'd probably be most comfortable on a 53 cm FP2 even though I'm 2" taller than the max recommended height on the sizing chart you linked. This is all, of course, specific to my preferred riding position and body geometry but suggests that the 55 cm frame might not be out of the question for a six-footer. Make sure you're comfortable on the bike (or one of similar geometry) before plunking down the cash, though. Peter White Cycles has a pretty comprehensive article on bike fit that I learned a lot from--it's more qualitative in its approach but gives a good understanding of things to take into account. In short--maybe, but it depends on your preferred riding position and body geometry. 

So I'm a bike noob in terms that my bike is certainly new, and since I bought it I've had problems with it. So this time, I've figured where the problem comes from, it's the rear casette exactly, once it's under load, it makes a creak sound, which at high speed, sounds like a click, and in the past used to be just a click, very loud, it has been reduced to a softer creak now; let me make a timeline of important events. 

I bought a new bike, a trek MTB marlin 7, and for the first moment (a week later) it started having issues, it was clicking awfully, the pedals broke, the brakes were rubbing, the mudguard broke which I noticed they attached with little plastic things and holes drilled; I got it mostly fixed but clicking didn't go away, I brought the bike around 6 times to the bike shop for them to fix the horrible clicking that came from the back, every time it was a temporary fix, then they said they changed the freewheel and it went away and I thought I finally got a breath, guess what the clicking is coming back, this time creaking too, I don't want to go for seventh time to the bike shop, I just would like to get rid of the bike at this point and have my money back. I honestly don't know if this is normal, this is my first bike, any advice?... 

I foolishly did something similar and rode on just loose enough pedals long enough that they started orbiting and carved a nice wedge right out of the crank, destroying them. I suspect that is where you might be headed here. Get new cranks. Alas. 

I find it hard to imagine you could get a carbon seat post catastrophically fail. (I say that as someone who has broken a Titanium seat rail, a Ti frame in three places, and a Ti stem. Generally on a very stiff frame, (like Aluminum) getting a carbon front fork, carbon seat post can help absorb some of the harshness of the frame. 

I am actually living in the NYC region now (NJ, other side of the GW) and I am too chicken to try the hill from the GW on the way home once the road is wet. That is too steep and long to do in my mind. So I would say weather here is not too extreme, more wet than really cold. My wife bought me this nice heavy winter coat (not for biking, rather for wearing to work etc) that I have worn 3 times in 5 years now. But I may be odd that way, not getting all that cold. For bike riding I used a MEC (Mountain Equipment Coop, Canadian store, sort of like REI and EMS) jacket that was windproof on the front, fleece on the back. I would pump out steam in cold weather, when I stopped at a light. Strange site to see. 

Knobby treads are really only useful in mud, sand, or snow. On roads (even rough ones) they just add extra weight and noise. Of the tires listed so far, the Bontrager and Panaracer tires look like better choices than the NanoRaptor. I've heard good things about the Schwalbe Big Apple as well. 

I think the tires would be durable enough (my winter commute in nearby Kitchener, ON is about 20 km/day and my Marathon winters hold up pretty well) but they're definitely going to feel more sluggish than a road tire. If you're normally running them with enough air pressure to keep the studs clear of the pavement, I think that kind of defeats the purpose of them (and that much pressure makes the ride a little harsh for my liking as well). Carbide studs will last as long as the carcass of the tire holds together, and there's always a chance of running into an icy patch somewhere, even if 99.5% of your route is bare and dry. 

You should be able to look up the frame geometry (useful for comparing to an online fit tool) on the manufacturer's web site if the bike is new enough. Many times there will also be an approximate frame size-height sizing chart available online as well. I've tried the online fit calculator that GuyZee recommends and it seems to work well for me, for what that's worth. 

I happen to think sandals are a bad idea. They provide next to no toe protection. I know people who have ridden in the winter with sandals and love them. (Goretex socks as outers for water protection and whatever you need inside for the temperature). But the problem is there is so much crap on the road, you never know when something will pop up hit your feet. This was funny as after reading about the guy with the Goretex socks, I tried my ride to work in sandals, and actually hit a bit of wrapping (The stuff the tie up stacks of wood or things on pallets with) that was on the ground, and whacked my toes pretty badly. The more I looked around as I rode on the street I realized there is way too much crap on the road for sandals to be a good idea. As zenbike said, to hop out for coffee, sure. But if you are going to do any road riding, it seems ill advised to me. 

I think on a bike it would be harder to reach max HR, but in running it is easy. Find a hill (say 1/2 KM long) that is reasonably steep. Warm up for 20 minutes of running, and start doing hill repeats. Aim for a pace where you can do about 6 repeats. Do the first three at increasing paces, and then for 4 and 5 start pushing to the max you can handle. As jensgram said in his answer, push till you are about to faint, or vomit, or whatever your body uses to tell you to stop. This is pretty darn close to your max HR. At least functionally, before your body ups and quits on you.
