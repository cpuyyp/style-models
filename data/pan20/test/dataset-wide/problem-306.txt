However, besides the mechanical, there's also a biological aspect to consider. A bird's wings are mostly feather. Feathers are not living tissue, do not require blood supply, and are very good insulators. This allows swimming birds to extend their wings more or less with impunity underwater, and to retain their body heat while swimming. A dragon's wings, however, are batlike, meaning that they are mostly skin, and a dragon is covered with scales, which do not trap air like feathers. This means that a dragon will rapidly lose body heat when submerged, and the moment they extend their wings, they start to act like radiators and the dragon starts losing heat even faster. Given that dragons are lizard-like, you may decide that they are cold-blooded, which means that heat loss is a serious problem. It's not an insurmountable problem - there are aquatic reptiles in the real world, such as swimming snakes and the marine iguanas of the Galapagos Islands - but it does limit you to warmer waters only. Alternatively, you could say that because dragons breathe fire, they have an internal source of heat, but even so, they probably wouldn't enjoy this rapid cooling. On the other hand, you could say that a dragon's internal fire causes them to overheat, and they use their dives into the sea to cool off so that they don't expire (or combust!). This could also answer your secondary question: why can swimming dragons still fly? A dragon who breathes fire might need to dip in the sea to cool off periodically, but their fire doesn't work so well underwater, so they never become fully aquatic. If they nest above water, then they're at risk from predators and egg thieves. Nesting on cliffs or high places makes it harder for most things to reach them, which gives them a reason to retain the ability to fly. At that point their main threat is birds, who use feathers, which fire is quite effective against. In fact, fire may be more effective at nest defence than at hunting; provided the cliffs (or wherever the nest is) are largely non-flammable (so that the dragon doesn't catch itself in a forest fire), breathing fire into the air from a static, grounded position is likely easier than trying to breathe fire on a grounded target while flying over it - not to mention that using fire to hunt may result in a meal that is either unreachable due to being in the middle of a brushfire, or inedible by virtue of being mostly charcoal and ash. Thus, you have a creature that uses fire to defend their nest against the birds who are able to reach its inaccessible location, while frequently taking dives into the sea to cool off using its large, radiator-like wings to avoid self-inflicted heatstroke or self-ignition. 

The simplest way would be to take a page - or an entire chapter - from Orson Scott Card's Ender universe. Search for "Demosthenes' hierarchy of foreignness" for more details; below is a rough overview. Basically, there are degrees of strangeness when it comes to other life. Aliens could fall into any category. 

Spread the force... When materials are subjected to forces, what happens to them is determined by their properties - their strength (sheer, tensile, compressive, etc.), their brittleness, and other factors. If the force is below the threshold they can handle, then they can transmit that force externally, onto other things; if the force is too great, it causes changes internally, and the material fails. In other words, if you push something gently, then it can pass that on to what's behind it; push too hard, and it breaks. Spread across space Weapons are mounted on hardpoints, which have two main properties: 

The real world has plenty of examples of birds that ca swim brilliantly, so obviously wings aren't a disadvantage per se. However, there are a few caveats: 

The general idea is that if your aliens are of the last sort, war may be unavoidable. If you can't find common ground with an alien race - if you can't communicate with them, even at the level of simply expressing ideas or emotions - then there is no way to negotiate. If they are sufficiently strange by human standards, then there can be no empathy or shared instinct between us, which means neither of us can predict how the other will act or react in a given scenario. They might not even realise that killing us is something we don't like, and without communication, we can't tell them. This makes them a threat, constantly, regardless of the situtation. If we can't live apart from them, and we can't keep them out, then our only remaining option is to destroy them. Of course, once you resort to violence, you have to be sure that it'll work, particularly with an enemy that's unknowable, and doubly so if they have better technology or military power than you do. You need to remove their ability to respond as quickly as possible, or you're toast. Their motives may be strange to humans, but in general you can assume that any intelligent creature that hasn't been killed off yet must have some sort of survival instinct which includes the neutralising of threats, and you're about to make yourself a threat to them. If violence wasn't your last resort, you failed to resort to enough of it. In human conflicts, there's often a back-and-forth exchange, a slow escalation, with neither side wanting to overdo it for fear of doing too much damage to the land they'll have to live in afterward - or being seen as a dangerous aggressor by the international community. With an unknowable alien, you can't be sure that the rules of this game will be followed. They may meet your first strike with a retaliation by the full force of everything they have. Even if they don't, the longer the fight goes on, the more they wear you down, and the more chance they have to do something you weren't expecting. Therefore, you have to hit them as hard as you can in your first strike, to maximise your chance of success and minimise the uncertainties. 

I'm surprised that nobody has mentioned this so far: the attraction of railguns isn't just that they can reach higher muzzle velocities; it's how they do so. A railgun can give its projectile a continual acceleration as long as it's between the rails, whereas a chemical-propellant gun has most of the push being delivered initially, dropping off as the gas expands. A railgun could therefore reach the same muzzle velocity as a conventional firearm with more manageable recoil, because it's a relatively low push over a longer period of time, rather than a solid kick that tapers sharply. Guns that use shock-absorbers basically do this, using the initial kick to compress a spring or piston that then delivers the recoil to the shooter as a sustained force rather than a short impulse, which demonstrates that it does help. To approach the problem from the other side, if you take the maximum instantaneous force that a shooter can reliably control, you'll find that a firearm, by virtue of how the propellant expands, will hit this limit for a brief moment and then drop away as the gas expands down the barrel. A railgun, on the other hand, could stay at this limit for the entire time that the round is inside the barrel. Applying the same force for more time means that your round will reach a higher velocity. 

This process of generating as many fast-moving chunks as possible so as to spread the damage is called fragmentation. Sometimes your projectile might be designed to shatter on impact, or even explode beforehand; other times it's just about striking in such a way that you maximise the fragments thrown off (perhaps by having a round that will tumble erratically as it passes through the target rather than punching through pointy end first). 

You seem to have missed a key factor in evolution. It all starts when random physical processes happen to produce a basic form of life. At this point, it's true that those random processes could produce something that behaves like a logic gate just as easily as they could produce something that behaves kinda like DNA or RNA. The next step is that this basic form resists processes that would destroy it, and somehow produces copies of itself so that it becomes more common. DNA and RNA have chemical mechanisms by which they produce more of themself. As they do this, some of the copies come out slightly different, because of errors or imperfections in the copying process, or mutation caused by environmental factors. These differences allow for a general diversifying - variations on a theme. Those variations that are poorly suited to the environment will die, while better-suited to the environment will die less, and therefore you'll end up with more of the "fitter" ones about. There's no notion of "superior" or "more advanced" here - it's simply a matter of which ones are most able to avoid dying. A logic gate does not have a way to produce more of itself, and therefore cannot "evolve". For this to work, your initial basic form needs to be able to self-replicate. A self-replicating system built from NAND gates (for example) would be very complex, which makes the chances of it forming spontaeously small enough that we would never expect to actually see it happen. The distinction - and the thing that many people forget or don't realise - is that DNA is more than just a component of an animal like us humans. DNA is a complete self-replicating system in its own right, which happens to live inside of another self-replicating thing (the cell) which forms a part of an even larger self-replicating system (the organism). DNA can survive and multiply just fine by itself, given the right environment. When you have a DNA test, they take a sample and multiply it using a process known as PCR so that they have more to test. Basically, they're taking a part of you, and getting it to make more of itself. On the other hand, you can't take a chip out of your computer and get it to build a few dozen copies of itself. 

And so the whole thing happens again until the pieces are small and/or slow enough that the materials they're hitting can stop them. This is particularly important in space, where you're likely to be in vacuum: 

This reduces the amount of force that any one part of your craft takes, helping to keep it below that critical threshold. The important part, however, isn't spreading the force over more space - it's time that's key. Spread across time With a weapon like a cannon or railgun, you can accelerate the projectile gradually over a long track or barrel, applying force the whole time by the expansion of gas, a magnetic field, or some other means. This means you can apply a (relatively) gentle force, which adds up over time to give the projectile a very large velocity. This reduces the force that the structure has to support at any given moment while that projectile is being accelerated. On the other hand, when that projectile strikes a target, the material of that target will be attempting to bring the projectile to rest in a much shorter time. Force is defined as the rate of change of momentum, and the time you spent giving the projectile its momentum is much longer than the amount of time it spends punching through an armour plate - the peak forces are much higher, and therefore more likely to exceed the threshold at which the material fails. This explains how your ship can be made of the same stuff as theirs, but theirs breaks and yours doesn't. By keeping peak forces low, your ship can spread the force out and experience the weapon fire as a slight push applied to the whole ship, while theirs has the force concentrated and experiences it as a hole being punched somewhere. Spread across mass Conservation of momentum says that the total "nudge" your ship experienced has to add up to the same amount of momentum as the shove that their armour felt, but because your ship spread it over more mass, it's less noticeable. A weapon whose recoil changes the velocity of a multi-tonne ship by a few metres per second might send chunks of debris flying out at hundreds of metres per second because the chunks have so much less mass. Of course, their craft may have similar mass to yours - or even more - but because they couldn't spread the force, that didn't help them:
