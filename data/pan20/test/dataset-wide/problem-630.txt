Do not use glove oil on a Brooks saddle. A saddle is a hammock in design, a glove is not, oil will break down the leather and make it eventually unable to handle the weight of a rider, and the leather will start to pull away from the rivets and you will have to adjust the tensioner a lot more frequently which will shorten the life of the saddle. Brooks has been making their saddles for over 100 years, they know how best to treat their saddles. So follow only their care instructions and not some bicycle guru on the internet, or your local bike shop, or some friend, etc. Brooks even states in their warranty that the use of any other product other then Proofide on their saddle will void their warranty, end of story. 

Disk brakes are great and necessary if you use carbon fiber wheels, or are riding a mtb or cross bike in severe yucky conditions, or you have a fat tire bike, for road conditions disk brakes are not really necessary, and consider this, a rim brake is the exact same thing as a disk brake is (in fact the rim brake uses the rim which has a far larger surface area then a small rotor and thus actually runs cooler), they both have pads, and they both use a metal contact point like a rim or rotor to stop. While an aluminum rim does wear using rim brakes those rims will last 35,000 miles on average, rotors on the other hand average 2 to 3 years, rotors cost between $10 to $90 each so lets say an average of $50, plus $20 for the average price pad which will need replacing every season; the average dedicated rider rides about 6,000 miles a year so in 5 years the disk brake user will have to spend about $130 for brake maintenance, while with rim brakes a set of pads cost $12 and will last at least 7 to 10 years, but the rim has to be replaced so lets assume the rim cost $400 for a decent aluminum rim. (these were just averages so don't shoot me if the numbers aren't exactly correct.) So you can see how much more rim brakes will cost as was pointed out by another poster...except for one small problem: A road bike wheel makes about 670 rotations for every mile that is travelled. During that time, the rim is constantly compressing under the weight of the rider, such that every spoke is loaded and unloaded with each rotation. This ongoing cycle of radial load takes its toll on the wheel, inevitably producing fatigue. Lateral loads also contribute to wear and tear of the wheels. These forces are generated as the rider transfers their weight from one side of the bike to the other when pedalling out of the saddle. Lateral loads are at their greatest during sprinting and climbing efforts as the bike is violently tipped from one side to the other. The drive-train places extra load on the rear wheel in the form of torsion of the hub, and with disk brakes that torsion is a lot greater which is why the fork and rear stays have to be reinforced or the frame/fork too will take a hit. Once again, there is an ongoing cycle of loading and unloading for the spokes/rim, and that contributes to the development of fatigue. There are no outward signs of this fatigue until the spokes, or rim starts to break or crack as a result. Therefore both rim brake and disk brake users will have to replace the rims due to fatigue, thus in reality in the long run the rim brake is far less expensive to use. Also if disk brakes are used in the rain a lot you could be replacing pads as often as after a couple of rides which really drives up the cost of disk brakes, whereas the pads on rim brakes don't care if it wet or not; and on long wet rides it's recommended you carry a spare set of pads for disk brakes! Also the stopping ability for both brakes are identical, I even tested this with an experiment with a friend who has disk brakes and was confident his stopped better than my, so we ran side by side at 14 mph, 20 and 32 mph on dry pavement and we both hit are brakes at the same time, we did this 6 times at each speed; then later we tried the same thing on wet pavement at 20 mph, and the results for all the tests were a tie, sometimes he stopped a tad quicker and sometimes I did, none of us stopped shorter than a foot from the other person (at the 32 mph test I actually stopped a tad shorter during the whole test, we think the disk brake may have experienced some fade because he mentioned he had to use more hand pressure to stop the bike then before). The only thing that we could think of as to why sometimes one stopped shorter than another was reaction time, one of us would hit the brakes before the other and that person stopped a tad shorter. VeloNews reported this: “Road tire traction is high enough that in practice, the braking limit on a road bike is often not the traction limit, but the tip-over point — the point when the forward weight shift from braking causes the rear wheel to lift off the ground and the bike begins to do an endo. (You can test this yourself by riding at a slow speed on smooth pavement and clamping the front brake trying to induce a front wheel skid — if you brake hard enough, you’ll find that the rear wheel lifts off the ground before the front wheel can begin to skid). In other words, road tires often have more traction than can actually be used for braking.” Thus what they’re saying is on dry conditions it’s all about tire adhesion to the pavement, if all things are equal, body weight, bike, riders ability to stop fast, tires, road surface, etc, they both will stop in the same distance which I was able to prove in my test. all of this nonsense about how fast disk brakes can stop isn't true, it's just marketing hype. One poster mentioned a drawback to rim brakes is oil getting on the rim, not sure how you could get oil on a rim unless you were real sloppy with lubing your chain and too lazy to clean the rim afterwards, two fails right there. But what the poster didn't mention was that oil will cause the same issue if it gets on rotors as well. With mechanical disk brakes you have to be careful not to buy a bike with small diameter rotors which rules out buying lower end bikes with disk brakes, small diameter rotors won't stop you as well as rim brakes. With hydraulic disk brakes the lines tend to be fragile. Brake modulation with disk brakes fail in comparison to rim brakes; whats weird about this modulation thing is that the best brakes I've ever used for modulation was single side pulls! dual pivots removed some of that modulation and disk brakes removed more of it due to shorter shorter mechanical lever that requires less leverage and reacts to quickly (and this is where the fallacy that disk brakes must be better because the brakes crab fast...it's an illusion caused by the shorter mechanical lever; mechanics and physics do not magically change for bike components and braking. For road-biking applications, anyone who advocates disc brakes over rim brakes has never taken physics, and does not understand how torque works and/or what a ‘lever advantage’ is. Disc brakes are excellent for cars but bikes are not cars. People can SAY that disc brakes have more stopping power than rim brakes, but saying it (and even repeating it) doesn’t make it so. physics is not on the side of disc brakes; you generally want the braking force to be applied at the greatest (practical) radial distance from the hub, where it provides the most effective translation into torque. For bike wheels, in particular, you would not want the torque to be applied at the hub, given that the contact with the ground (which is where the drag or “slowing” actually occurs) is at the perimeter of the tire thus causing the spokes to have to translate the force from the disc out to the tire. And finally, the disc brakes are necessarily offset from the centerline of the hub which causes a lateral or shearing force that is roughly proportional to the amount of braking that is being applied (and is also proportional to the amount of the offset from the centerline of the hub), which can result in a lateral “pull” under very hard braking conditions. The fluid in a closed hydraulic system on disk brakes heats up and expands on long descents and tends to lock the brakes. Rotors bend easily if something hits them (or they get so hot they warp) making the bike unrideable, with rim if a rim gets bent you can try straightening the rim and ride on. Mechanical disk tend to need more frequent adjusting then any other type of brake system. You cannot swap wheels with another disk brake equipped bike. Again let me stress this, if you have carbon fiber wheels you should be using nothing but disk brakes, it actually can be hazardous to be using rim brakes with CF rims even if those rims have an aluminum brake track though not as much as all CF rim. But for road bikes the added maintenance and setup hassles of disk brakes aren't worth it; I've been riding for over 40 years on rim brakes, including racing, and never had any issues with stopping, even racing in the mountains of S California. I also known people who toured all over the US and even Europe with heavy 75 pounds average loads with cantilever brakes and never had problems stopping even while descending. And speaking of descending, rim brakes suffer from less fade then disk brakes due to the much larger surface area of the rim that cools faster than the smaller surface area of the rotor. Look, the CF wheel manufactures were having issues with their wheels experiencing brake fade, delaminating, and failing when they heated up, something of which was costing them lots of money on warranty returns in addition to R & D; plus a lot a manufacturer’s found themselves lying to customers about the cause of the delamination and failures and placing the blame on other reasons so that they wouldn’t have to pay any warranty adjustments which in turn makes the companies doing so look bad. This is why the evolution of disk brakes on road bikes came about and not for any other reason. And even if pro cycling ever legalizes disk brakes, which they will as more and more CF wheels come onto the scene, the pros will use whatever is given to them, and they will sell the technology to us because that's what they're paid to do. damn, I've written an rambling essay! I guess I had nothing else better to to tonight, since I didn't want to see the ball game!
