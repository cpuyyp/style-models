A person who is perceived as negative. Earth example: Adolf Hitler Racially different group, or having caste system in place (beggar versus noble) Notable meme of such society. Examples: Grumpy Cat Historical event which was perceived as negative. Example: Hiroshima, Vietnam War 

This is one of reasons why humanity started from cave: What keeps them at this specific location? It ain't get better in other place, because monsters are everywhere. Yes, true, but it does not hold you back to go uphills. Go to cave, where you have to defend only small place (entrance to the cave) and it evens out the numbers pretty fast. So, other tactics could simply be: Find easy to defend place 

You will trade only futures Future contracts are traded even today. When trading from Earth to Mars, you would trade only futures. Martian Stock Exchange would trade other financial instruments, but I assume Earth - Martian stock exchange would be heavily based on futures or long term contracts 

You will use different approach: Step 1: Discover a planet. You are going to use already existing telescopes. Example: Kepler-186f Note: From now on I am using planet Earth as example Step 2: Analyse planet position and its spectrum. You will realise that it is in habitable zone and can support life. From the spectral analysis you should be able to know, that such planet has water AND oxygen. Something funny can be going on! Step 3: Listen and analyse even more. Ok, here I am going to assume you could not catch any signal. It can happen. But still, such planet looks promising Step 4: Send probe. Possibly for fly-by. Problem with our grant system is, that you need results fast. So first probe will do just fly by and send even more promising pictures: 

Yes I recommend you to read The Second Machine Age book for better understanding of what is now going on: Moore's law still holds on, and the above mentioned book assumes, that it will still be valid for next 20 years. Today, in 2015 we are in situation which was "unthinkable" in 2000: 

Mindset combined with stupid law Imagine being very very rich. How would you see manual labor? As something demeaning. Not worth of you. Below par. But also imagine new state law being introduced by the state, that if you want to build something for a state, you have to have at least 70% (and maybe higher amount) of domestic workers. So on other hand you have almost no one wanting to take the construction job, because its "poor man job" but on other hand you have need for people being here. So, people end up in construction will be two factors: a) Too dumb to actually take any other job b) Too shy to tell anyone that they are doing their job and basically hating their job On other hand, the general expectation of people will be, that no good can come from "poor man jobs" so failures will be expected. 

My Artificial Intelligence became self aware and escaped from the box. It managed to install itself in every computer and every cellphone. Surprisingly, it does not want to kill us, but it seems it wants us to make happy. This AI installed an app to every phone: "Find your true love" app which will pair you with your perfect soul mate. AI knows everything about you by knowing all from your phone and your search history. So it knows what you fancy and it can perfectly match you with another user of this app (and from before we know that almost everyone is using this app) What will be short term society effects of using this app? Things to assume being true: 

Have a country which is actually built by more nationalities, or from more logical parts. Examples: USA, Switzerland, Great Britain Form a federation from these parts. They share president, but local governments are partly independent Make politicians talk about the split Alternatively, you can let people vote about the split Make politicians and/or people agree on the split Split everything. Currencies, debts, land, people You have two sovereign republics now. 

For every minute they can sit around one table, eat together and have at least "neutral" conversation (that's why we invented small talk about the weather), you get a point. If you gain 30 points and more, then you win a prize. In other words: No, no, no and again... NO 

1.: You need water - Fun fact. First "plants" on Earth started in atmosphere without any oxygen. But without water (Moon soil) you would be no go with even the most clever design ever. 2.: You need minerals - You can go away with microbes, but the plant needs to feed on something. That is how we grow most vegetables for mass production: Hydroponic planting in water enriched by all minerals what plant needs. So again, water only is not enough. Water with minerals could be a GO, but: 3.: You need stable environment. Although you could avoid a loads by clever DNA design of such plant, still, on Earth you have temperature range from -80 Celsius to +50 degree Celsius. I believe that on surface of Moon you can go more extreme ranges. Long story short: It is engineering problem: You need plant of a design which would keep its own micro-atmosphere (sphere like design, where plant would breathe inside such sphere) You need a plant able to survive extreme temperatures both ways. Basically taiga wood mixed with desert cactus. And, bonus, such plant should survive with as little water as possible (more cactus design than Siberian taiga wood) In sci-fi setup of really developed DNA engineering, I think you could pass such idea on. But in reality I think you would crash on extreme setup of the environment. 

Huge mindset shift is needed in order to make the ban happen: I am just going to list several "honorable mentions" of people or states or organisation drastically changing their approach: 

Fun question! I am going to tackle it from alternate-history point of view and offer several plausible scenarios from that: No Undo at all: 1) Computers did not make it to "personal": Did the machine for cracking Enigma code had Undo? I doubt it. Did ENIAC had undo? Double doubt it. Correct me, if I am wrong, but I think that because we discovered transistor, it allowed computers to be smaller. Imagine a world where we did not discover transistor. As you can see, it would still allow computers to appear, but they would remain big, bulky and ... without undo functionality. Almost no Undo: 2) Ridiculous software patent owned by patent troll company: The big names, as we know them now, started from garage. (Yes, both Microsoft and Apple). Imagine that PaTrollCo* is buying the SW company which came with "Undo" first and patents it. Since then, the PaTrollCo sells this patent for ridiculous amount of money, actually causing that almost no one is using this functionality * Not actual name, all resemblance with dead, living or other companies is purely fictional. Do not sue me, please 3) Bill Gates was right 

I know that Global Warming is controversial topic, so for scope of this question please accept below statements as facts. (And if you have hard time accepting them, just assume alternate Earth): By year 2030, the North Atlantic ocean will melt completely, leaving no ice behind. Santa Claus is aware of that and tries to find better place from where he should deliver the Christmas presents. Where should Santa Claus realocate his hideout after North Pole melts completely? For sure it needs to be somewhere where you meet no people and it should be snowy. But where on Earth should Santa go? 

I can see these approaches. I ordered them from most plausible to least plausible: 1. We are in this together mindset Well, if you keep secret how to get food, you might screw everyone. Including yourselves. When everyone is dead, you are dead. The people in position of having the extra knowledge will indeed know this and work together with rest of the people on the survival. 2. We rule you mindset - aka the Shaman approach The people in knowledge would be highly appreciated by the rest of the community. Maybe even worshiped. Because if shaman is dead, the whole community is dead. The shamans (=people in knowledge how to survive) would carefully train new apprentices, including seeking of people of specific traits inside current community. (Say only extra high people can really get all the resources you need for survival) 3. You work for us mindset Curent society is dependent on about 1% of population food wise. The people to obtain food for the rest are called farmers and no one really care about their conditions. We are just happy to chew on the apple, not caring where is the apple actually from or how much did person growing such apple actually received on salary. The same applies for programmers. Although salary wise the situation is better (hello from saturated Czech market), still we kinda do not care about who actually programmed our Apple product. Although the people create very low amount of population, still no one cares about them. And society works fine... Yet :) 

I was watching the movie The Martian and I realised afterwards that thanks to its really great CGI, some people think it is based on real story and there are even some who think it was made on Mars. While both is false, it opens another question: How to prove you actually landed on Mars? Setup: The year is 2025. After your least favorite candidate for POTUS of 2016 had their 2 terms, a cool guy is elected president in 2024. One of his promises is get us to the Mars. For reals. Thing is, that 2024's blockbuster movie was completely generated by computers. And about 80% of viewers could not tell that the actors are made up. Even though the movie did cost awful lot of money, it opens lot of conspiracy theories. You are NASA director. The rocket to Mars is fully tested. Astronauts ready. Probability of mission to Mars success: Over 97 percent. Even though you communicated all the preparation steps openly to the public, everything is communicated through electronical media. Photoshop version released in 2023 is really easy to use and average home computer can make really great CGI. How to convince the people that you are actually going to get there physically and walk on Mars by 2026? 

Bad luck Look, it's great that you got all the magickal jewelry to improve your armor by 200 percent. But now it seems, that you need to wear your armor all the time - there are suddenly falling objects, tree branches hitting you and you slipping and falling to sharp object. It can be mindset, or it can be truth. But people tend to wear only X magic items at a time, because having more is generally considered bad luck Name of God You pointed out, that to make object magical, you have to scribble runes onto it. Going from Norse mythology: The runes are from God(s) and made by God(s). And the point is, that it is generally believed, that X runes put together might accidentally spell out the "True name of God" No one knows what happens, but I dare you to wear more than X objects! You could end the World existence! 

The setup: Near future (maximum 50 years in future) where "only" thing changed is, that company SpaceX together with NASA and ESA found out, how to get cargo and people to space very cheap USA decides to build a space prison. Because - it would be nearly impossible to escape from it. Now the question. We hand wave away economical aspects (basically, we have money): What drawbacks would we face, if we would like to build a prison in space? What challenges need to be considered? What would be impact on society? And how long can I keep prisoners there? 

One big handvawe: Everyone involved in the process agrees with the fact, that ESA is going to fake it. They just want to hear Ode to Joy from space for a change. Bonus points for elaborate guess how many people do I need being involved. Keep in mind: This is ESA/European mission only. So if you need specific place to fake the landing, you have to find such place inside Schengen Area. Faking the landing at Atacama dessert is no-no. Winning criteria: Cheapest plan 

Common fantasy trope is, that members of one fantasy group hate members of different group. For example: Elves hate dwarves. But in most fantasy setups, it is never shown that dwarves would hate another members from same group. For scope of this question, lets define terms: 

If you turn legal age, you are allowed to vote (and be elected) No matter what you do, you have always at least one vote For every dollar you paid on taxes you get one extra vote For every dollar you received from state (social or other supports). you lose one vote No extra buying of votes is allowed. If you want to have extra votes, pay your taxes properly. Your "voting account" is added up from election to election and are "nulled" once new government is estabilished If you have less than fiscal year between elections, data from last closed fiscal year are used. 

What makes you think there will be money? If I can assemble big couch and TV, what stops me from assembling some money? The nanobots can literally print money and bonus: They can print them in a way that makes them feel used. Feel old. And bigger bonus, if I let my imagination loose: They could theoretically assign such "batch number" to the money that you could not tell if they have been issued by government or by nanobot. I will use one thing from almost every motivation book and video I did read or listen: If money were no subject, what would you do? If you have excellent nanobots, you created post-scarity society Sure, there will be people who like just to sit back and watch ... Wait a second. Who will create the shows? The music? Who will be in government? Some people do what they do simply because they enjoy doing it There will be always someone who will want to be the President. Just for being the president. There are people who totally enjoy doing accounting. People who play music just for the enjoyment from it. So, the answer is: The government does not pay for themselves. Because there is no need to issue paycheck in first place. EDIT Post scarity society can work only on people willing to do their job. And if there is totally no one willing to take the job ... program nanobots to do that! 

The thing is, what kind of drug could Joe Average eat to let him forget almost everything? And if you cannot be drugged to forget your own name, what drug would let you forget the past? (And as long to the past as possible). Bonus points: What would be side effect of such drug? 

Othervise, usual parliamentary system is assumed with government having 4 years for usual turn Some examples:
