Following up on Joseph's comment: Branko Grünbaum and others have pointed out that besides the 13 or 14, there are also two infinite families of polyhedra meeting the definition of Archimedean, although generally not considered to be Archimedean. Why prisms and antiprisms are excluded from the list has never been clear to me. In any case, this is not just a historical curiosity --- in any attempt you make to classify them, you should run into these two infinite families. If you use a modern definition, i.e. vertex-transitive, then you will also get 13 others. And a little group theory can help in the classification. If you use a more classical definition, i.e. "locally vertex-regular," you will indeed find a 14th. 

The following seems to be well known to experts, but I would be happy if there is a paper or textbook that I can cite. Note: all of the manifolds are assumed to be without boundary. Suppose that $C$ is an open manifold, and that it contains two sets of submanifolds: $Z_1, Z_2, \dots, Z_n$ are $j$-dimensional compact submanifolds, and $Z^*_1, Z^*_2, \dots, Z^*_n$ are $j$-codimensional closed submanifolds. Suppose further that $$Z_i \cap Z^*_j = \emptyset$$ whenever $i \neq j$, and that $Z_i$ intersects $Z^*_i$ transversely in a single point for every $i$. Then $\dim H_j (X, \mathbb{Z}/2) \ge n$. (Bonus question: Moreover, if the submanifolds are all orientable, then the same holds with $\mathbb{Q}$ coefficients.) 

For a striking example of a classical result in algebraic geometry given a tropical proof, see A tropical proof of the Brill-Noether Theorem by Cools, Draisma, Payne, and Robeva. The original proof of this theorem (by Griffiths and Harris) involves subtle transversality arguments, which they are able to circumvent in this "combinatorial" proof. The new proof is also valid in all characteristics. 

Suppose $C$ is a smoothly bounded convex body (*) in $\mathbb{R}^d$, and $p$ is a point on the boundary of $C$. Let $r>0$ and let $B(r)$ denote the ball of radius $r$ centered at $p$. 

One might guess that the chromatic number of the hyperbolic plane is increasing as the constant negative curvature decreases, but if so does it grow without bound? 

Fáry's theorem says that every finite simple planar graph admits a planar embedding with straight line edges. For which $(k,d)$ is it true that every finite $k$-dimensional simplicial complex embeddable in $\mathbb{R}^d$ has an embedding which is linear on every face? It is true when $d \ge 2k+1$ by putting things in general position. I am especially interested to know if anything is known about the case $(k,d)=(2,3)$. I vaguely remember an old conjecture of Branko Grünbaum that every triangulation of the torus admitting a "straight" embedding in $\mathbb{R}^3$ but I don't know a reference (or whether this is still open). 

One metric on trees that has received a lot of attention over the past ten years is the one introduced by Billera, Holmes, and Vogtmann in their paper, "Geometry of the space of phylogenetic trees." I am not sure what you mean by "mind maps", but this metric has been of particular interest for statistical and biological applications, so it is probably worth a look. 

(Here $d$ is the dimension of the lattice.) Since the number of boundary vertices is at most some constant times the number of vertices in the animal itself, this also gives an affirmative answer to your question. 

There have been several recent advances on packing regular tetrahedra in $\mathbb{R}^3$. All the results I've seen have been lower bounds -- first John Conway and Sal Torquato showed that there exists an arrangement of tetraheda filling about 72% of space. This has been improved in a series of papers, and the latest result of which I am aware is Elizabeth Chen's record of 85.63%. (A NYTimes article summarizing the history of the problem can be found here.) My question is does anyone know of any upper bounds, either published or unpublished? I saw a colloquium by Jeff Lagarias, and he said someone was claiming that they had proved something like $1 - 10^{-26}$, but that it was still unpublished. (A compactness argument gives that since regular tetrahedra don't tile space the maximum volume is strictly less than one, but this argument does not give a quantitative bound.) 

Let $M$ be a zero/one random symmetric matrix with zero diagonal. Presumably the eigenvector $v$ corresponding to the smallest eigenvalue of $M$ is not perpendicular to the all-ones vector 1 with high probability. Choose $v$ to be normalized so that $d = 1^T v > 0$ and $v^T v = 1$. Then choose $\alpha>0$ so that $A=I+\alpha M$ has smallest eigenvalue (with eigenvector $v$ obviously) of $d^2 / (2n)$. Now $v^T(A-1\cdot 1^T/n)^v = v^T A v -v^T 1\cdot 1^T v / n = d^2/(2n) - d^2/n<0$, so $A - 1 \cdot 1^T / n \not \succeq 0$. 

The problem: We have a $n$-state Markov chain with arbitrary initial distribution and transition matrix $P$ that is arbitrary except that we know that $P$ has trace $n-1$. Of course $P$ is also a stochastic matrix. Let $b(n,k)$ denote the suprememum, over all such matrices $P$ and initial distributions, of the total variation distance between the distribution of this chain after $k$ and $k+1$ time steps. I am primarily interested in bounds for fixed $n$ as $k$ goes to infinity. In the remaining description of partial results I will therefore focus on the following question: what is the largest $\alpha \ge 0$ such that $b(n,k)=O(k^{-\alpha})$, where big-oh hides a function of $n$. For fixed $n$ all matrix norms are equivalent, so it suffices to bound some matrix norm of $P^{k+1} - P^k$ by $O(k^{-\alpha})$. In particular using the vector $\ell_p$ norm $|\cdot|_p$ and its induced matrix norm $||\cdot||_p$ it suffices to bound $|(P^{p+1}-P^k)v|_p$ for all vectors $v$ with $|v|_p \le 1$. I'm using terminology primarily from Horn and Johnson's Matrix Analysis book. Partial results and discussion: One can use Markov chain couplings to show that $||P^{k+1}-P^k||_1=O(1/\sqrt{k})$. (See Lemma 10 in $URL$ .) All eigenvalues of a stochastic matrix are at most 1 in absolute value and the trace of a matrix is equal to the sum of eigenvalues, so we conclude that all eigenvalues of $P$ have real part between 0 and 1. Consider the special case of $P$ symmetric. Then $P$ is symmetric then it is orthogonally diagonalizable with real eigenvalues. For any $0 \le \lambda \le 1$ it is easy to show that $|\lambda^{k+1} - \lambda^k| = O(1/k)$, so therefore for symmetric $P$ we have $||(P^{p+1}-P^k)||_2 = O(1/k)$. Consider the special case of circulant matrices, i.e. matrices $P$ where $P_{ij}$ is a function of $i - j \mod n$. The trace restriction implies that the diagonal entries of $P$ are $(n-1)/n$. By Gersgorin disks it follows that all eigenvalues are within $1/n$ of $1-1/n$ in the complex plane. If my calculations are right the maximum over that circle of $|\lambda^{k+1}-\lambda^k|$ is $\Theta(1/\sqrt{nk})$ for $k >> n$. Finally the eigenvectors for circulant matrices are orthogonal, so we conclude that $||(P^{p+1}-P^k)||_2 = \Theta(1/\sqrt{nk})$. It turns out that circulant matrices are diagonalized by discrete Fourier transform matrices, i.e eigenvector $v_i$ satisfies $(v_i)_j = \omega^{ij}$ where $\omega=e^{2 \pi i / n}$ is a root of unity. This allows us to sharpen the above bounds a bit. One can show that any eigenvalue of $P$ is of the form $1 - 1/n + (1/n)*\sum_i \alpha_i \omega^i$ where $\sum_i \alpha_i = 1$, $\alpha_i \ge 0$ (convex combination), and $\alpha_0 = 1 - 1/n$. For $k >> n$ one can show that $|\lambda^{k+1}-\lambda^k|$ is $O(n/k)$ for any $\lambda$ of this form. Given the above results I have a strong suspicion that for general stochastic $P$ with trace $n-1$ we have $||P^{k+1}-P^{k}|| = O(1/k)$. Of course you might say that a better conjecture would be limited to matrices $P$ that are unitarily diagonalizable (a.k.a. normal), but I haven't found examples where non-normality makes things worse so I'm conjecturing $O(1/k)$ holds for non-normal matrices as well. One simple example of a non-normal matrix $P$ with $||P^{k+1}-P^k||=\Theta(1/k)$ is $P=\left(\begin{array}{cc}1 - \epsilon & 0 \\ \epsilon & 1\end{array}\right)$. (This has trace strictly greater than $n-1$, but that's fine as the trace can be corrected be extended by adding two dummy states without significantly changing the problem.) Extending the above eigenvalue-based proofs to the general case runs into a huge roadblock: eigenvectors are not in general orthogonal. This is a problem because the initial distribution vector may in general have unboundedly large coefficients when translated into the eigenvector basis. The mixing time of these Markov chains can be unbounded, so techniques for bounding the mixing time are not obviously helpful. Edit: the following example shows that the eigenvectors can have an arbitrarily small angle. $$P=\left(\begin{array}{ccc}1-\epsilon & 0 & 0 \\ \epsilon & 1-\delta & 0 \\ 0 & \delta & 1\end{array}\right)$$ Its (right) eigenvectors are $(\delta-\epsilon,\epsilon,-\delta)^T$ , $(0,1,-1)^T$ and $(0,0,1)^T$. As $\delta$ approaches $\epsilon$ the first and second eigenvectors become arbitrarily close to parallel. 

In Chung and Graham's "Erdős on Graphs: His legacy of unsolved problems," they discuss several open problems concerning Turán numbers for bipartite graphs. There is a construction which gives graphs on $n$ vertices with $C n^{5/3}$ edges, with no $K_{3,3}$ subgraphs, and at the time of the writing of this book there was no better lower bounds on the Turán number of $K_{4,4}$. 

Take a random configuration of $n$ non-overlapping discs of radius $r$ in the unit square $[0,1]^2$. (You could think of this as taking $n$ points uniform randomly in $[r,1-r]^2$ and then restricting attention to the case that every pair of points $\{ x,y \}$ satisfies $d(x,y) \ge 2r$.) From the point of view of statistical mechanics, the interesting case is when $r^2 n \to C$ for some constant $C > 0 $ as $n \to \infty$, and various kinds of phase transitions have been studied experimentally, but little seems known mathematically. What I am wondering about is whether anyone has studied the following kind of percolation. Set $\lambda >1$ to be a fixed parameter to measure proximity. Define a graph by considering the centers of the $n$ discs to be the vertices, and connecting a pair $\{ x,y \}$ by an edge whenever $d(x,y) < 2 \lambda$. 

For a lattice in $\mathbb{R}^2$, if we include each edge independently with probability $p$ (i.e. bond percolation), it is well known that there is a critical probability $0 < p_c < 1$ depending on the lattice, such that if $ p > p_c$ then there is almost surely an infinite component (i.e. with probability $1$), and if $p < p_c$ then almost surely all components are finite. The square lattice is special because it is self-dual. This allows one to guess that in this particular case $p_c = 1/2$, although the proof of this fact, originally due to Harry Kesten, is fairly subtle. One wonders if there is an analogous fact for "two-dimensional" percolation in $\mathbb{R}^4$. In particular, consider the hypercubic lattice as a $1$-dimensional cubical complex, and then attach two-dimensional square "plaquettes" independently with probability $p$. Since the hypercubic lattice is self-dual, we might expect some kind of phase transition when $p=1/2$. My hope is that topology would give us the right language to talk about this. One possibility, and perhaps the nicest answer I can imagine, was suggested to me by Russ Lyons: If $p > 1/2$ then there are almost surely embedded planes, and if $p< 1/2$ then there are almost surely not. Here the embedded plane should be the union of closed $2$-cells. It turns out that once $p > 1/2$ in $\mathbb{R}^2$, there are not only infinite components, which implies embedded half-lines, but embedded lines as well. Another possibility is that once $p > 1/2$ there are almost surely bounded $1$-dimensional cycles in homology $H_1 ( - , \mathbb{Z} / 2\mathbb{Z})$, which are boundaries of unbounded two-dimensional complexes, and that when $p < 1/2$ there are almost surely not. (I believe that this is similar to the "plaquette percolation" studied by Jennifer Chayes in her Ph.D. thesis, but the work I know of is in $\mathbb{R}^3$.) I am not an expert in percolation theory, and would really like to know if anyone knows about any previous work in this area, or any standing conjectures. (Or is there any obvious reason that either of the possibilities I suggested could be ruled out?) 

The Hirsch conjecture asserts that the graph (i.e. $1$-skeleton) of a $d$-dimensional convex polytope with $n$ facets has diameter at most $n - d$. After being open for decades, Francisco Santos has recently proved that this fails in general. 

Yes, a lot is known about this. See Mathew Penrose's book, "Random Geometric Graphs." He discusses subgraph counts for random geometric graphs on distributions with bounded, measurable, density functions --- this includes uniform distributions on any convex body as a special case. He also discusses maximum clique size. See also his recent paper with Yukich, Limit theory for point processes in manifolds.
