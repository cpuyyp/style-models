In order to calculate this, you can use the Stefan-Boltzmann law to calculate the star's surface flux and its absolute magnitude to get the luminosity. Once you know the surface flux and luminosity, you can find the radius of the star. Stefan-Boltzmann Law: $$ F=\sigma T^4 $$ Absolute Magnitude - Luminosity calculation: $$ \frac{L}{L_\odot} = 10^{0.4(M_\odot - M)} $$ where $L_\odot$ is solar luminosity and $M_\odot$ is the absolute magnitude of the sun. Next, you use the formula for intensity and solve for distance: $$ r = \sqrt{\frac{L}{4\pi F}} $$ Compiling all this into one equation, $$ r = \sqrt{\frac{L_\odot * 10^{0.4(M\odot - M)}}{4\pi \sigma T^4}} $$ As long as you use SI units for $L_\odot$, $\sigma$, and $T$, you'll get $r$ in meters. 

There are two primary reasons Planet Nine (if it exists) is extremely hard to detect: it's very dim and its position is not well constrained. 

The $b$ in your equation, brightness, is what we call a "Flux". That's the amount of energy per unit area at a certain distance. Flux can be calculated using the Stefan-Boltzmann law. $$ J=\sigma T^4 $$ where $\sigma=5.670373\times10^{-8}\space W\space m^{-2}\space K^{-4}$is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, This is measured in Watts per square meter. That means that we will need our distance to be in meters, and we will get a luminosity in Watts. We can go a little further and divide our answer by $3.828\times10^{26} \space W$ to get our final value in solar luminosities (L$_\odot$). That will make our final equation: $$ L=\frac{4\pi R^2 \sigma T^4}{L_\odot} $$ Because we're using the Stefan-Boltzmann equation, instead of the distance to the star, we have to use its radius. Vega's radius is $2.362 \space R_\odot$, which is $1.64\times10^9$ meters. Its surface temperature is 9,600 K. Plugging in those numbers yields a luminosity of: $$ L=42.7L_\odot $$ This value is slightly different from the value quoted by Wikipedia, due to rounding, but is well within the acceptable range. 

The main reason supermassive black holes aren't visible in images of our galaxy is because of all the dust and stuff in between the center of the galaxy and us. The Milky Way's bulge is ~16000 light-years thick. There are millions of stars, and huge clouds of dust in between us and the black hole, which block visible light. Most of our measurements of the center of our galaxy are made in radio wavelengths. In addition, compared to galaxies, black holes are small. A supermassive black hole might have a radius of up to 400 AU (for the really large ones). The nearest spiral galaxy to us, Andromeda, is 778,000 parsecs away. This corresponds to an angular size of 0.0005 arcseconds. Even the Hubble Space Telescope only has a resolution of 0.043 arcseconds in the optical. That means that Hubble can only see things that are 100 times this size. So we wouldn't even be able to see any black holes in another galaxy. That being said, we can make observations of black holes using indirect means. For example, one of the ways we are able to precisely measure the black hole in our galaxy is by watching stars orbit around it. We take pictures of these stars in the infrared and radio wavelengths, which pass through the dust. By measuring how fast these stars are moving, we can calculate the mass of the black hole. In other galaxies, we can observe other effects of black holes, such as active galactic nuclei, and quasars. So despite being unable to get an optical picture of a black hole, we still know that they're there. 

The star at the center of TRAPPIST-1 is called 2MASS J23062928-0502285. It was discovered by the Two Micron All-Sky Survey (2MASS), which imaged the whole sky in the infrared between 1997 and 2001. This resulted in a catalog of over 300 million objects. TRAPPIST-1 itself was cataloged in 1999. The name is actually its coordinates in right ascension and declination. The planets of the TRAPPIST-1 were discovered by the method of transit photometry. The way this works is a telescope watches a star for a period of time and records the amount of light coming from the star. They chart how much light is coming from the star as a function of time, creating a light curve. If they see periodic dips in the intensity from the star, there is a high likelihood that that star has a planet in orbit around it. The planet blocks the light from the star every time it passes between us and the star. This causes the dips in the light curve. One advantage to this method is that you can scan multiple stars in the same field of view, analyzing them all for planets. By measuring how long it takes planets to pass in front of the star, how much light it blocks, and how often they orbit, scientists can calculate the masses of these planets and how far away from the star they are by using Kepler's laws of motion. TRAPPIST-1 was initially determined to have planets orbiting it by the Transiting Planets and Planetesimals Small Telescope - South team. From their data they determined that it had at least 3 planets. One of these planets was in the habitable zone of the star. They published their results in the journal Nature in May 2016. Once TRAPPIST had determined that the system had planets around it, NASA trained the Spitzer Space Telescope on it. Ground-based observations of Trappist-1 are difficult because it is so dim. Spitzer, an infrared telescope, made more precise measurements of the light curves and determined that there were at least 7 planets in orbit around it, 3 of which were in the habitable zone. Additional observations were made by numerous other telescopes including the Very Large Telescope, UKIRT, the Liverpool Telescope, and the William Herschel Telescope. The results were also published in Nature. 

There are many calculators online to convert local time to local sidereal time, but I can't find any resources to convert the other way. Can you convert back by doing the same conversion backwards? I found equations on this website to convert to LST. Would it be valid to use this equation to convert back: $$ UT = \frac{LST - \frac{L}{15} - 6.697374558 - 2400.051336*T - 0.000025862*T^2)}{1.0027379093} $$ where $UT$ is the time in Universal Coordinated Time, $LST$ is the Local Sidereal Time, $L$ is the longitude, and $T$ is: $$ T = \frac{JD-2451545.0}{36525.0} $$ where JD is the Julian Date at noon UTC. Once I've calculated the time in UT, I then add or subtract 24 until the result is within 0 - 24 hours. Then I can convert from UT to local time. I would prefer to have this as accurate as possible. I did a calculation using this, but according to Stellarium I was off by about an hour. Could this be due to Daylight Savings time or something? Here is the Python code I made to do the calculation. 

Combining both of these reasons, it is very difficult to search for Planet Nine. We're looking for an incredibly dim object in a large area of the sky. 

The simplest explanation relies on the statistical unlikelihood of us being at a special place and time in the cosmos. Let's say, for a moment, that we see galaxies moving away from us because of some cosmic explosion that set them in motion. In that case, we would expect to see the galaxies in one direction moving faster than the galaxies in another. Looking towards the center of the explosion, we would see galaxies on the other side moving much faster than if we looked in the other direction. This, however, is not what we see. What we observe is all galaxies moving away from us, with a speed proportional to their distance from us. That means that the further away they are, the faster they are moving. It doesn't matter what direction we look in; a galaxy 500 Mpc away in one direction will have a recessional velocity approximately the same as one 500 Mpc away in the other direction. This forces us into one of two conclusions: either we are at the exact center of the universe, which is statistically impossible, or space itself is expanding, so everything is moving away from everything else. The animation below shows how this would work. From any given point in space, it would look like everything is getting further away from you. 

You shouldn't think of black holes as "sucking things in". Black holes interact with matter through gravity, just the same as any other object. Think of our Solar System. All the planets orbit around the sun because it has a lot of mass. Since the planets have some lateral motion (they're not moving directly towards or away from the sun), they circle around it. This is known as conservation of angular momentum. When talking about gravity, all that matters is the mass of the objects involved. It doesn't really matter what kind of object it is*. If you were to replace the sun with a black hole that had the same mass as our sun, the planets would continue on the exact same orbits as before. Now, the black holes at the centers of most spiral galaxies do accumulate mass. Some of these black holes have accretion disks around them. These are swirling disks of gas and dust that is slowly falling into the black hole. These gas and dust particles lose their angular momentum through interactions with gas and dust nearby and by radiating energy as heat. Some of these black holes have very large accretion disks, and can generate huge amounts of electromagnetic radiation. These are known as active galactic nuclei. So, long story short, black holes don't "suck". They just interact with things gravitationally. Stars, gas, and other matter in the galaxy has angular momentum, so it stays in orbit around the center of the galaxy. It doesn't just fall straight in. This is the same reason the Earth orbits around the Sun. *Disclaimer: When you talk about things like tidal forces, you do need to take into account the size of the objects. But for orbital mechanics, we don't need to worry about it because the distances between the objects are generally much larger than the objects themselves. 

First off, you need to understand what "Redshift" is. Light that is redshifted means that its wavelength has increased, making it appear more red. This can come from a variety of sources, including Doppler shifting. What we're more concerned with here is "cosmological redshift". As light travels through space, its wavelength increases due to the expansion of space. We can use a measurement of how much the light has redshifted to calculate the distance to its source. There is nothing "beyond" redshift, because redshift is just a lengthening of the wavelength. And nothing is happening to the objects themselves, they just appear to get redder to us. Next, the definition of the "observable universe". Because light travels at a finite speed, it takes a certain amount of time to reach us. The universe had a beginning in the big bang, meaning that light has only had a certain amount of time to travel. Therefore we can only see things out to a certain distance. Light coming from objects further than that has not had enough time to reach us yet, so we can't see them. That's what we mean by the "observable universe". Galaxies do not "phase out of existence" because of redshift. As we look outwards, we're looking at older and older objects. Because the light takes a certain amount of time to reach us, we're essentially looking back in time. As time passes, however, we can see more and more because light from further away objects has more time to reach us. Dark matter and dark energy cannot be directly observed because they do not interact with light. They do not absorb it, emit it, reflect it, or anything else. However, they are still within the observable universe, because the observable universe is basically just the size of the universe. There are many different theories as to what dark matter and dark energy actually are, but they are not ordinary matter that has been "blackshifted". 

A profession in astronomy can entail various things. Unlike what other people are saying, you don't have to have a PhD in astronomy to do work in this field, to be an astronomer. There are other options, but you will have to work hard.
