To answer this, one really has to understand how the geometric and bond albedos are defined. Let's start with the bond albedo since its simpler. Bond Albedo The Bond Albedo is just the fraction of energy hitting a surface that gets reflected. To simplify the process, let's say I shoot 100 photons of all the same energy at Enceladus. Of those 100 photons that hit the surface, 81 of them will be reflected back and 19 of them will be absorbed. That means the bond albedo will be $81/100 = 0.81$. Simple right? As such, the bond albedo can never be greater than 1 because you obviously can't reflect back more photons than you received. This means that a bond albedo of zero implies no light was reflected and all of it was absorbed, whereas a bond albedo of one implies all light was reflected and no light was absorbed. Geometric Albedo The definition of the geometric albedo is a bit more complicated. The first thing you have to realize though is that it is not a straight zero to one scale. A geometric albedo of one doesn't mean all the light got reflected like it did for the bond albedo. So let's try to define the geometric albedo. There are two important points about the geometric albedo that make it differ from the bond albedo. For the bond albedo, we talked solely about the total amount of incident light and the total amount of reflected light. This says nothing about an observer of said light. We just have some magical way of knowing about every photon that hits and is reflected by your surface and that allows us to calculate the albedo according to the bond albedo definition. The geometric albedo on the other hand specifically takes into account your ability to observe the light from a specific vantage point. The second major point is that the geometric albedo is a measure of how well your particular surface reflected the light back to you compared to a reference surface. Imagine now you have two surfaces, one is the surface of Enceladus, the other is your "reference surface". This reference surface is an "idealized" reflector which means that it reflects every photon that hits it (making it have a bond albedo of 1). The key here though, is that it reflects light isotropically. What I mean by that is that the light doesn't get reflected in any preferred direction, but rather gets reflected in all directions equally. So now you have your 100 photons hitting your reference surface and all 100 photons get reflected, but because they're all reflected in random directions, only 10 photons actually get to your camera/eye/detector. What can happen with Enceladus though, is that the surface has just the right properties such that 100 photons hit the surface, and 14 photons get reflected to your detector because the surface preferentially reflects light in a specific direction. It's sending more photons to your detector than the reference surface. The geometric albedo is the ratio of how much light gets reflected to your detector by Enceladus over how much light gets reflected to your detector by the reference surface. In this case, $14/10 = 1.4$. One small, additional point, is that this definition relies on your detector being in the same direction as your light source. In other words, the geometric albedo is a measure of how much your surface can retro-reflect (i.e., reflect back to the source of the photons) compared to the reference surface. Technically, the geometric albedo attains a maximum value when your surface is made up of retroreflectors. 

I tend to think the best explanations are the simple ones which explain the core concepts of the concept without getting too fancy or detailed. That being said, I'd just explain what happens during a gravity assist. 

I'll assume that after you're randomly placed in space and time, that you can make any observation one could make here on Earth - that is, you have whatever equipment is necessary to observe anything about the Universe we can currently observe. I'll assume that you have access to all current astronomical knowledge (in a digital library or some such thing) such as star catalogs, physics books, published papers, etc. 

I wouldn't say nullifies. In fact, I would think it makes them a bit stronger. The process of the Earth forming elsewhere, being flung out of its stellar system and captured by ours (and put in its proper place), then forming a Moon and life, requires that these events happened extremely quickly. While not impossible, it is improbable, especially when you add in your argument for the Earth being in a very precise orbit unlikely to have been achieved if it had been captured. If you argue that the Moon/Life formed after capture you're really limiting the time and chances that the Earth didn't form in our system. 

In this scenario, the three masses end up in the contrived scenario. I ran the simulation backwards by setting the timestep and the end time to be negative. Path of three masses for $t_0<t$ 

The paper you linked is specifically trying to understand massive $(M\gtrsim 8\:\mathrm{M_\odot})$ star formation. It is still an open question as to exactly how very massive stars form. Do they form all at once in a giant accretion event ("top-down" formation) or do they form by having a bunch of low mass stars merge ("bottom-up" formation) or by some other process altogether? The authors of the paper state that it is particularly tricky to study high mass star formation. 

The orbital velocities do not have to be and in general are not equal in magnitude. What is equal is the angular velocity, that is the angular rate (e.g., in $rad/sec$) that two bodies will be orbiting their common barycenter. The orbital radius, $r$, orbital velocity, $v$, and angular velocity, $\omega$, are related by the equation $$\omega = v/r$$ Note that these are all scalar quantities and $v$ can be thought of as the component of the velocity vector which is perpendicular to $r$. Since conservation of angular momentum implies that $\omega$ remain constant for each body, individually, then we know that $v/r$ must also be constant which implies that bodies which orbit farther away from the barycenter must necessarily be orbiting faster and vice versa. Now of course that simplifying explanation works for two bodies. Once you throw in more than two bodies, things become more complicated and the barycenter can move around, causing more complex motions. 

I'm going to answer this question, not because I believe you want a thoughtful, coherent answer, but rather for others who may come across this question and look at the propaganda you've posted. I don't believe anything I can say will change your mind, but hopefully I can inform other, unsuspecting viewers The Context The video you've posted is from thunderbolts.info. This is a pseudo-scientific organization that widely promotes well-debunked and/or non-scientific concepts such as creationism or the ideas of the Electric Universe. This video specifically discusses the concept of Dark Matter and tries to make an argument that scientists have now finally disproven that dark matter exists. To back up this claim, they cite two news articles and have a voice over from an "astronomer" named Barry Setterfield. The disrepute of the video is pretty clear when, within the first minute, they state: 

What you see above is what's known as a Magnetic Dipole field. The reason being that there are two (Di means two) magnetic poles, namely the north pole and the south pole. This is completely analogous to a giant bar magnet you may have played with in science class. You can see here that the field lines leave the magnetic south pole and travel around, going up into the magnetic north pole. The field lines don't really leave from or enter the Earth's equator. But why does this mean aurora's happen at the poles? Because, according to the theory of electromagnetism, charged particles are forced to travel only along magnetic field lines. They cannot travel across them or break free from them. Once they get stuck, they're stuck (this isn't 100% true but for the purposes of this answer, it is). Note that the particles can travel both forward and backward on the field lines. They're not constrained to going only in the direction of the field line. This means that the primary location in which these charged particles can enter the Earth's atmosphere is where the field lines tend to hit the atmosphere and we already noted that that location was the magnetic north and south pole (which coincidentally is near the physical north and south pole). Auroras themselves are just emissions from our atmosphere in response to being bombarded by high energy particles. To put this all together, here's what happens: The Sun spews out huge amounts of energy and tons of charged particles. Some of those charged particles hit the Earth's magnetic field and get trapped in it, being forced to travel along the magnetic field lines. They are then constrained to primarily hit the Earth's atmosphere at the magnetic poles where their extreme energy excites the atmosphere, causing it to emit light in shimmering red and green sheets. The auroras can't occur at the equator simply because not enough particles can hit the atmosphere there to cause auroras. One day though, we may see auroras at the equator. The Earth's magnetic field is not fixed and moves with time. About every 450,000 years the field flips around completely. Its been about 750,000 years since the last reversal so we're due for one potentially soon (and by soon I mean in the next few thousand or tens of thousands of years). During the flip, while the magnetic poles are over the equator, you'll see auroras there. 

I wanted to throw my hat into the mix to flesh out another contributing factor. One reason these "geysers" are so capable of achieving great heights is a lack of atmosphere on Europa to slow them down (and to a lesser extent, weaker gravity). I wrote a basic "physics simulation" in Python 3 which illustrates this purpose, the code for which is below. 

To be fair, I chose an ejection velocity which would give me a height of 100 km (which I stole from userLTK's answer). Play around with other ejection velocities as you wish. Thin Atmosphere There are two factors here to produce a thin atmosphere. First, setting the density of air at the surface. Without spending the time to dig into more realistic numbers, I'll use ($kg/m^3$). For reference, on Earth it is $1.225\:kg/m^3$ at the surface. The other factor is the scale height. This number controls how rapidly the atmosphere disappears as you go up. A smaller number means a thinner atmosphere that ends more quickly. A larger number means a persistently thicker atmosphere that extends much farther. Again, I didn't look up what a proper scale height should be, but for reference on Earth the scale height is about $8\:km$. Here I used ($\mathrm{meters}$). In this case, I get the output: 

This is more or less what Phiteros says in his comment above. As he states, the distinction here is not that the universe wouldn't exist at all, as you state, but rather it wouldn't exist as we know it, with galaxies, stars, planets, or life of any form. To explain a bit more, the basic idea is that the universe will have started out with a more-or-less homogeneous and isotropic distribution of matter with some density $\rho$ (this is a pretty strong assumption in its own right, and worth addressing in a completely different answer). Note that the overall curvature of the universe is directly tied to this density so you may see some sources talk about this in terms of curvature instead of density. The main point, as described in the quote above is that the evolution of the universe, i.e., the ability for galaxies, stars, planets, life, etc. to form, is dictated by a critical density, $\rho_c$. If $\rho = \rho_c$ (or as close to equal as to be insignificantly different), our universe can form as it is now. The flatness problem comes into play because the Big Bang Theory implies that if the universe did not start out with (almost) exactly $\rho = \rho_c$, it would have veered far off course from our current universe and resulted in either a Big Crunch or a Big Rip. This idea poses a really big problem for the Big Bang Theory because it requires such a precise setup for our universe, where any betting person would've said there's no way the universe could've started out with $\rho=\rho_c$. The main resolution to this problem is by introducing inflation into the model. The main idea here is that the Universe may or may not have started out with $\rho = \rho_c$, but so long as it was close enough, the hyper inflation at the beginning of the universe would have forced the difference to be so small as to be effectively zero, negating the effects described in the quote above. Another potential, and not necessary mutually exclusive answer is found in the Anthropic Principle, which I won't delve into here. 

In order to determine the the brightness of the inner planets, we have to do some more math. Unfortunately, people don't really calculate the absolute magnitudes of planets so the form of the distance modulus listed above isn't entirely useful. Instead, we'll use a different form. $$m_1 - m_2 = -5\log_{10}\left(\frac{d_2}{d_1}\right)$$ This equation relates an object with an apparent magnitude of $m_1$ at a distance $d_1$ to its apparent magnitude $m_2$ at a distance $d_2$. If we look up the apparent magnitude of the various inner systems from Earth, and figure out their distance from Earth at those times, we can figure out the apparent magnitude at the distance of your asteroid. I'll work this out for Venus since Venus will likely be one of the brightest of the inner planets (given its high albedo). Venus as viewed from Earth, at its brightest, has an apparent magnitude of $m_1 = −4.89$. This occurs when it is an the point of greatest elongation. As determined from this solar system orrery, the distance is approximately $d_1 = 0.75\:\mathrm{AU} = 0.36\times10^{-5}\:\mathrm{pc}$. On your asteroid, you'll be about $d_2 = 2.17\:\mathrm{AU} = 1.05\times10^{-5}\:\mathrm{pc}$ from Venus at the same point of maximum brightness (based on a little trig). From this we can calculate $m_2$ to be $$m_2 = −4.89 + 5\log_{10}\left(\frac{1.05\times10^{-5}\:\mathrm{pc}}{0.36\times10^{-5}\:\mathrm{pc}}\right) = -2.57$$ From the comparison table listed above, this would make Venus, at its brightest, about as dim as the "minimum brightness of the Moon". This is a rough calculation, but I don't expect the actual answer to vary too much from this value. Keep in mind, that's the maximum brightness of one of the brightest inner planets. Any other time Venus will be dimmer and all other planets will never be brighter than this. So all in all, the inner planets will likely be outshined by the much brighter Sun. There's a chance, with the right conditions, if you managed to properly block the light from the Sun using some sort of occulting disk or flower starshade, that you could see the inner planets with the naked eye as they still would be pretty bright in their own right. You just need to get rid of the sunlight outshining them.
