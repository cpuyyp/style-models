There are several dimensions to consider. Pre-note: To fear consequence of losing or not gaining that which is valued by the self is a natural instinct. Even the sympathy-driven fear of certain others suffering consequences is natural enough. Firstly there is nature of the consequence itself. Is it threat of losing or not gaining that which one would consider a right or a privilege (a right to live versus the right to watch TV)? Secondly - the nature of the challenge set - whether such is cooperative or competitive (is the individual rewarded for personal proficiency or are multiple individuals assessed as a group or are multiple individuals assessed against each other?) Thirdly - Consent. Are the participants willing or forced? 

Why should one suppose that an omnipotent God necessarily has to be good? In the same way that a child might wish to build something up for the pleasure of breaking it, might it not be that God might have an interest in seeing such evils play out? What if an omnipotent God were to exist beyond what we would consider the remits of good and evil? What if an enlightened curiosity were instead to be unfolding? In fact, why should we not suppose that the universe is in fact one with such an omnipotent God? What if time and space were but of the fabric of God and that all sentient life forms are but vessels drifting through their short existences gathering the essence of experiences to once again become one with the Creator? If this last possible interpretation were to be close to the truth then perhaps the answer simply comes down to 'experience'. 

I agree that they oppose each other, as you can't have liberty with equality, and you can't have equality with liberty. Equality taken as an ideal leads to communism, which is shown to fail whenever it is tried. Liberty taken as an ideal leads to anarchy, which is mostly untested but seems unworkable. Equality of liberty would be what I'd suggest we aim for. The same level of freedom for all, seems to make the most sense. 

He's stating that if we are capable of making decisions, determinism cannot be true, and that if determinism is true we are incapable of making decisions. This is a clear link between determinism and free will - the two suppositions cannot exist together without contradicting each other. 

In a deterministic world the mind is deterministic, but goes through the motions of reasoning to reach its conclusions. In such a universe our actions and beliefs are predetermined, and the state of our mind at the time of reasoning is predetermined, and so the path our reasoning will take is predetermined. The argument being presented is predetermined, and whether or not the mind will accept the rationale of that argument is predetermined. Taking this into account, an argument will only be persuasive if the deterministic mind is in a state where it is receptive to the argument. It relies on the listener having similar enough data patterns within its head for the sound arguments to be seen as sound - they may sound completely invalid if their worldviews are too far apart for the same conclusions to be drawn by each participant. What one mind sees as completely reasonable could be seen as completely insane by another mind. I would say when pondering reason, you should really be pondering perspectives, as rationale is built from perspectives. People will always have their own rationale for what they believe, built off their subjective perspective, and the word unreasonable merely means 'I don't understand' as opposed to 'there is a flaw in your thinking'. All this holds true in a non-deterministic universe as well, however, so deterministic or not is redundant when discussing reason. 

Both democracy (in its purer forms) as well as populism are ideologies involving a rule of the people by the people or representatives chosen/ selected by the people. 

Addendum - It is also pertinent to add that a poorly formulated question, by contrast, will have a tendency of either confusing the respondent or lead their train of thoughts in different directions from that intended. While accidents can be positive in their results, they generally serve the purposes of neither the seeker of knowledge nor the subtle imparting of views. 

You will find persons who live variants of both these lifestyles (catering for one's own happiness vs. catering for others' happiness). If one were to think of the self in terms of finite resources while taking the use of these resources to attribute benefit to the target (whether self or others) then one would face a few scenarios: 

The driving forces of sympathy and desire can transcend human-made rules and principles - and may take their place in their absence. A human being stripped of religion and philosophy is left with desires. Desires can be constant in their presence and they can also be impulsive in their intensity. Desires are self-centric and fan outwards. Independently of moral strictures the self will tend to benefit the non-self in gratification of the self. This is amplified in a context where the non-self is either inherently attractive to the self or where the assistance of the non-self may be of benefit for the self (selfish altruism). (A few classic examples. A male going out of his way to assist a female in distress (a flat tyre for instance). A restaurateur going out of his way to please a table of clearly affluent guests. The acts provide personal satisfaction and/or improve the odds of gaining the favour of the person(s) in question. The human being is a social being. To gain the approval of one's peers one will at times contradict principles that one holds to be true and/ or desirable. Perhaps halfheartedly, perhaps not. Perhaps driven by fear of rejection or ridicule. Perhaps driven by a greater trust. Humans, particularly those of a more mature age or inclination, are more at home with the familiar - with stability - and this is where consistency can be practiced as a means of satisfying this desire. However you will find that even those who live by consistency will at least desire to make exceptions. (An example of such is a person who may consistently advocate a particular penalty for a particular transgression - but who desires to make an exception for a familiar person - in such cases it may be desirable to review the proposed penalty in question if it be so harsh that one would not feel at peace to apply it universally)
