I actually mount my tires in reverse of the recommended direction sometimes, depending on the tire. Especially in the rear. What I've found is that when a tire has directional tread, it is has more grip in one direction. Thinking in terms of the rear tire, I find most manufacturers will put the rotation direction in the way that would provide better grip when braking. So if you are trying to control a slippery decent, you don't want your back tire locking up easily. However that means there would be less grip for slippery climbs, so the tire would spin-out easier. I usually orient my rear tire whichever way I think will climb better, and compromise my downhill braking if needed, since the front tire can handle braking too, but does nothing on a climb. Speaking of heltonbiker mentioning old tires, my favorite all around tires are the old Yeti Claws. They shed mud very well, are non-directional, and work front or rear. IRC later made them as and called them "Claw Comp"s. I still have a pair on a bike, but the tires are from like 1998 or so :) 

To later remove a grip, I usually slide a flathead screwdriver under the grip a little bit (trying not to puncture the grip, or scratch the bar), and spray Windex into the gap, then remove the screwdriver, and do the same in 2 or 3 other spots around the grip. Then with that liquid under it, it should be easy to make it twist and work it off the bar. 

As a plus for Smart-Phone apps, they are likely to progress quicker, add features faster, fix bugs faster, and provide more frequent version updates than GPS units. Another plus for smart-phones is that I'll take my cell phone on a long road ride anyway in case of emergency. Carrying 1 device is easier than 2. A plus for a GPS unit is that it is probably easier to read the display in outdoors sunlight, since it is designed for that purpose. And easier to clamp to the handlebars and monitor other things. If I had to pick 1, I'd go for the phone. 

Make sure your crank arms and chain ring are also tight. I've had loose crank arms on a square taper BB make a faint clicking sound/feeling when it was loose. Not sure what kind of BB that bike has though. If neither of those seems loose, and you have the tools, I would pull off the crank arms and spin the BB axle to see if the bearings feel ok. It is possible that you could have done something to mess up a bearing. 

I used to a) clean the handle bar well with isopropyl alcohol, then b) spray Windex (or whatever glass cleaner) into the grip to let it slip on to the bar. Then let it sit for a while, and the glass cleaner will evaporate, and leave a nice secure grip. 

With the cable disconnected, if you pull the derailer out toward the biggest gear, does it "spring" back to the middle or smallest chainring? It actually should take a good amount of force to pull it out to the largest chainring. There should be a very noticeable amount of spring tension trying to pull it back inwards. If it doesn't move and stays out at the biggest chainring, the internal spring might be broken, or very weak. 

To add some backstory; one of by bikes had a Shimano LX crank and square taper BB (2001-ish), and it had a large hex wrench bolt to hold it on (like 6 or 8 mm i think). I had to tighten the crank bolts so hard to make the arms tight, that my hex wrench's sides are now all twisted into a slight spiral, instead of being straight. 

Sometimes I've also taken a metal file and rake it over the brake pad surface a bit to scuff them up. Not sure if that would help your situation though. 

Right or wrong, I think a lot of people just see recumbents as "dorky". I think its more a perception bias than efficiency. 

If your bearing cones are loose, you should be able to feel it if you have the wheel off the bike, and wiggle the axle (not the quick release 'skewer' that slides through, but the hollow tube that the quick release skewer slides through). With the wheel on the bike, you would also be able to feel it by wiggling the rim side to side (perpendicular to the bike frame). If you try wiggling the rim side to side while it is on the bike, then you can watch the distance between the brake pad and the rim to see how much that distance changes to see how loose it is. If you can feel the axle move in the hub, then yes, you probably need to adjust the cones. There should be a lot of "how-to" guides out there if you Google it. If you are feeling a 'drag' once per wheel rotation, then you should make sure the rim isn't rubbing on the brake pads at some point in the rotation. Sometimes the axle doesn't seat itself all the way into the dropouts on the frame when you put the wheels on, and it will end up slightly crooked on the bike. 

In theory, "aero" spokes should be more aerodynamic, however if you think about stressing the spoke, it would be more stiff in the direction the wheel is rotating because it is thicker, and have more flex perpendicular to that, since the spoke is thin or flat on the side. I have double-butted spokes on my cross-country mountain bike, and raced on them for years without untruing the wheels, and it saves a small amount of weight per spoke but its at a point where the spoke isn't heavily stressed, so it retains most of its strength. Especially good for lighter weight riders on full suspension bikes where the wheels won't be subjected to as much of a beating in the first place. 

I try to keep my clothing layered, and in such a way that I can re-configure mid-ride. I'm always colder when I start, so I will often start my ride with arm-warmers and a short-sleeve jersey, and peel off the arm-warmers after I warm up. As the temperature gets lower, I'll use a long-sleeve base-layer with a short-sleeve jersey over that (my base layer is black, so i keep a jersey on to add color / visibility), and also start to add a nice warm vest (keeping your core/chest warm makes a lot of difference), and/or a long-sleeve fleece. All these layers can be removed and stuck into or onto my hydration pack (or tied around the bike frame) so even if I start my ride with a fleece, jersey, and arm warmers, I could stop and peel down to just the jersey in 30 seconds. So anyway, my overall suggestion is to keep a short sleeve jersey, and add arm warmers and a long-sleeve outer shell (fleece or a wind-proof jacket) 

I have also mounted a fork-mount to the wall and used that, but it means taking off the front wheel each time. It also makes the bike perpendicular to the wall, not parallel, unless you mount it to the side of a shelf or some piece of wood that comes away from the wall. 

Note that some of them look very similar to the example image posted by Daniel in the comments to your original post. You might be able to find a hardware shop or auto parts dealer that carries a variety of studs you can try to match up. 

If your looking for a "beater" fixie that you don't have to worry about getting stolen and maintaining, it might be worth checking out Craigslist. I see fixies come up every couple days in my area. IMO, its not worth spending the $ on a brand new bike to be your beater bike. If you want something brand new, Redline makes some nice bikes that are usually a tad cheaper than the competition. They make the Urbis which I think is around $750 or so, which I think is close to the Steamroller in price, but has a disc brake (which I suppose might make it more attractive to thieves, but does add value for the price). No idea on weights though, since manufacturers rarely publish them. What kind of budget are you looking at here ("too expensive" is a very relative term)? 

I end up having to evaluate this on a rider-by-rider basis. Typically if I've caught up to someone, then I'm going faster anyway, so I'll just pass them and keep my own pace. If someone passes me, then I try to keep up... Sometimes you see a guy on a high-end bike, who is obviously skilled, and is constantly pedaling and varying his effort for slopes (as opposed to pedal, coast, pedal, coast)... These people are usually OK with it. If they start drafting you after you pass, and they eventually re-pass you, then its game-on. I don't mind leap-frogging back and forth taking turns drafting, and the person in front basically trying to loose the tail. It makes otherwise boring rides more fun. Some people really want nothing to do with it, and you can usually tell because they will suddenly increase their pedaling effort to loose you, instead of maintaining pace. Typically though, I'll come up to someone, or as someone is passing me, say 'hi' and try to make conversation if the speed difference isn't too great, or we get stopped at the same intersection. If they aren't willing to say 'hi' back or just nod and ride on... they probably don't care for you drafting off them. The one time I really don't care is when I'm out on my hardtail mtn bike, and a road biker passes me. I'll draft and keep up with them for a couple hundred yards purely to annoy them that a mountain bike is pacing with them ;) 

The reason (and I'm no medical expert) is that it acts as a gradual cool-down period after the hard exercise. During any exercise it is good to cool-down by still moving and exerting less effort. Keeping the muscles moving helps remove lactic acid from the muscles (which contributes to cramping) and keeps the blood flowing. Also sudden changes between hard pedaling and stopping can make your blood pressure change more quickly. It is better to make gradual transitions. Basically, for all the same reasons that you should cool down for a few minutes after any strenuous exercise. In intervals, you are just doing it over and over. $URL$ 

If you know someone who has a tap and die set, it might help to use it to measure the size and thread pitch of the original. If you can't find an exact replacement for the original, you might be able to use a normal stud (McMasterr Carr sells a large selection here) and but a bolt down one side to act as the 'seat'. Also, look around for car exhaust manifold studs. I Googled "exhaust manifold stud" and this image came up: 

Congratulations on not wanting to settle for a department store bike, Murray Huffy etc... You've made the right choice :) As for that particular bike, The specs don't seem all that spectacular. The "retail $900" price would not be very good, IMO, but the $400 sale price isn't bad. It looks like most of the parts are pretty low end, but that is to be expected around that price. (Generally entry-level road bikes end up around $750-ish). Have you considered a used bike? Craigslist is a great place to look. About a week ago I got a 2002 Trek 2300, which was a $1900 bike back in 2002, for $320 with some extra stuff. There was also recently a 2005 Giant OCR2 for $400. Craigslist is a great place to find a used bike, if you check it every day for a week or 2, something is bound to come up in that price range, and is likely to have superior parts. You might also want to keep an eye on Nashbar, they have bikes branded under their own name that are relatively less expensive than the bid-name guys, and they have sales constantly (their sales change about every week). Currently they have some bikes on closeout and a few are in that $400-$500 range that might suit you. If you have ridden and like the bike you posted, then by all means, go for it. Bikes are funny things, and sometimes one just "speaks to you". I'm just trying to suggest some other viable options, and picking one online without test riding it can be really tricky, since geometries vary I also wouldn't worry too much about your weight. The frame is sure to support you. The places on the bike that would typically be effected are the wheels, and sometimes the seat rails (where the seatpost clamps to the seat. If possible, I would try to get a good seat, preferably with titanium rails. Best of luck with whatever you decide to get! 

I'm not too familiar with the Boxxer line, but it looks like they come in both a coil and air versions. If yours is a coil one, have you considered trying a stiffer spring? It is likely the cheapest option, and should help with the bottoming out, and will quicken the rebound for the 'packing down' on small bumps. Replacing the spring is probably the cheapest option too, so it might be worth a try. 

a little above the height of the front wheel hub when the bike is standing up, so I could just hook the front wheel to the wall, basically. In my case the hook is high enough up that the back tire of the bike is just off the ground, and is actually touching the wall, not the floor. The bike can be rotated on the hook to make it more parallel with the wall, up to the point where the pedal or the handlebar hits. edit: OK I guess my hooks in my shed are actually on the angled part of the roof, but in this picture I redrew where the hook could be, and then the back tire would rest on the floor.
