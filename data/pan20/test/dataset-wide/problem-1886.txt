Perhaps it might be better if I start out with some background first and that might give everyone a bit of an idea on where I'm coming from. I will be omitting all names here just in case. I work for a smallish company (less than 20 employees) and I get on very well with most of the employees. I used to have a good working relationship with my boss, who is also the head of the company until he started making some very unrealistic work demands which I was obviously not willing to meet. Since then, I have experienced emotional abuse and constant guilt-tripping from my boss about how I should be thankful that I still have a job and that the job market is very tough right now. He may be partially correct as I have been applying for other jobs unsuccessfully as other job applications are asking for x years of experience in with a diverse working background, which I do not have. This was my first job straight out of college and I feel that this will be the death of me unless I change. To continue on, I now have a different direct manager who is not much better. I also don't agree with my workplace's work ethics and the way that we are told to treat the customers. On one hand, we are told at company presentations how important it is to treat customers like God when in fact in reality, we lock them into contracts that they can't get out of and take them to court over it. I'd like to say that we are providing exceptional service to our clients and that we're holding up our end of the contract, unfortunately, I cannot. We are told to fix the immediate issue and no more. Even if it is only a temporary patch, and not a permanent fix. "The temporary fix will fail soon and they will have to come back to us for more service" was the usual response from my direct manager. There are no HR managers because the top 2 bosses are it. And they're both money grubbing and power hungry individuals and don't want to listen to what anyone else say. The only reason we still have any business at all is because our BDMs are very good and my colleagues and I are providing extra services to some of our clients when we know our manager is not watching so that these clients would stay happy and would refer us to other businesses. The people that I have put down on my CVs are all ex-employees of the business who have left, some on not very good terms with the management for the same reason. I have been to interviews where they have asked me the reason why I am leaving my workplace and I have said that it was due to a difference in working ethics with my current manager or that I needed a change of pace. These have all resulted in the job application falling through. I have tried to call back several places, asking for feedback for future job applications and have received responses such as "We are looking for someone with more experience in the field" or "We are looking for someone who can work well in a team and we don't think that someone with issue with the management in their current workplace will fit in". So my question here is: How do I answer questions about the reason why I'm leaving my current workplace without seeming like a troublemaker or not a team player? Unfortunately, I've never moved through to a stage where they would talk to my referees. 

If I were one of those employees, I'd turn it down, too. All that overtime is basically the result of poor planning. By signing up to do the overtime, it enables those bad planners to stay around and keep making the same mistake. If nobody shows up for overtime, eventually it puts the planners in the hot-seat. Consider putting the whip to their backs, and not the worker bees. Try that for a precedent. 

You'll find yourself in a much healthier place, over the long term, if you don't fall prey to the "comparison game". I don't care if you spend 100 years on a job -- there's ALWAYS, and I mean ALWAYS going to be someone around where you may feel they're not worth what the company's paying. This will be co-workers, bosses, subordinates. At this place you're at - and you seem upset - you give away your power to any situation where you seem to be earning less money than someone else who isn't necessarily "better" than you at the job. You'll drive yourself crazy. We aren't put here to be the same as everybody else. I've left a good link above that might interest you. Best of luck. 

If you're busy comparing what you get with company A vs what others get at Company B, the real root of your concern is in the comparison. Other places simply have a whole different ecosystem. If your current place isn't one to keep up with the times, you're not probably going to be able to do much to change it. Seems the other engineers figured this out before you did. Whether you follow suit comes down to how badly you want more money out of the deal. 

Frankly, unless you can relate it directly to the ability of your candidate to do the requirements of the job, OR some disruption to your office, it's really none of your business who the candidate showed up with. Maybe they're travelling together today to run errands, and the interview was on the way between point A and point C. It might seem more reasonable for Mom to come inside and sit in an air-cooled office than to send Mom to the mall or Starbucks, or let her sit in a car for an hour. To some degree, we can take into account how your office is situated, and the line of business -- but at the end of the day, a waiting room is for people to WAIT in. Had the applicant dragged Mom into the interview room, we'd have a different situation. Had Mom been someone with a behavior or outward appearance to cause alarm to anyone in your facility, again, a different situation. You didn't mention that either of these were the case. Accordingly, you can't assume anything about your candidate, or their relationship, from the fact that Mom sat in the waiting room; the only thing that you can assume is that, apparently, Mom needed to sit. 

You take a leaf out of the politicians interview playbook and answer with the Grad school GPA - answer the Q the puts you in the best light even though its not the "exact" Q asked. 

All recruitment agencies in the UK have to see proof of right to work in the UK - its not Identity they are verifying but your eligibility to work in the UK. They are using an EU passport to verify that you can legally work in the UK I have had to produce my birth certificate both for the agency and my employer. 

You can ask but asking for relocation for 25 miles might raise some eyebrows - relocation is normally offered for cases where you have to move a long distance and 25 miles isn't a long commute. 

No outside of special cases such as those covered by the official secrets Act (our your country's equivalent) there is no legal way to restrict candidates from disclosing this. 

In the UK the norm is to pro rata the holiday through the leave year if you take 50% of your holiday and leave 25% of the way though the year you do owe them its normally deducted from your last pay cheque. You may be limited in how much leave you can carry over. You need to say when you leave year starts. 

No culture develops over time and is overwhelmingly derived from the grass roots and the employees that make up the company modified by the culture these employees come from Senior management can attempt to change/modify culture but this is hard and can backfire. Sounds like you have been reading to many MBA case studies by HR professionals trying to make their role seem more important than it is. 

Use examples from your work experience where you have had to investigate a new technology or technique. E.g. the initial proof of concept was to slow for production so I investigated the possible solutions and taught my self node.js and rebuilt the system using that. 

Up to a point but for Elite schools (Both University and High school) going to Oxbridge, ENA, Harvard or to say the Oratory or King Edward VII (or the equivalent in your country) is going to open doors that going to a lesser institution is not. 

Your day to day manager is the obvious choice or if you have 121's and appraisals the one who does the appraising. I think you may be over thinking this one 

If I were the security manager, and you showed up to report a missing $2 sticker, I'd hand you $2 and send you on your way. For all you know, it could have been dumb kids in your neighborhood, or anywhere you parked your vehicle. You can replace the sticker, or not. But don't expect anyone to go on a witchhunt over it. Slashed tires, broken windshields, or similar are on a whole different level. "Don't Sweat the Small Stuff" -- Richard Carlson 

Absolutely! Especially if your intuition is throwing hints in your direction. There are places I've been where I've walked in the front door to interview and instantly been concerned with the company's ability to send home paychecks on time. Cluttered spaces, run-down furniture, peeling paint. This is by no means a complete list of indicators. You'd never want to work for any business that's just as sloppy on internal processes. 

I think the hinging piece on this is the phrase "confirm the offer later". Now, I'm not sure if contract law works the same in India as it does in the United States, but here (I'll just presume that it does) an employer can get in hot water for trying to change the terms of an employment offer after the employee has accepted the offer, IF the employee then takes actions that would not have occurred if there was no offer. "Actions" might include resigning from the old position, relocating, and so forth. If the employee makes an offer, and it's accepted, and then the employer decides to withdraw the offer, the applicant-employee may be able to recover damages in court. S.K., have you OFFICIALLY accepted (confirmed, as you put it) the offer? Friend S.K, it's sounding like you are afraid that the new employer will withdraw the offer - which is reasonable, if you don't comply with the request to start a month earlier. I don't know what recourse specifically is available in India - you'd have to contact an attorney for that. My own take on the situation is that if you agreed to one situation, but now the new employer is pressuring you to accept another situation, that's a bad precedent right from the outset. You might consider finding another place to work that will treat you better. 

Your mileage will ALWAYS vary. I've used recruiters on and off for 20-some-odd years, mostly for contract gigs. Some disappear after your interview. Some will make a follow-up call if nothing positive ensues. You may end up, at times, feeling like an a** -- even if you felt the interview went super well -- due to the treatment you receive. Let it roll off your shoulders. But then again, HR departments don't necessarily treat you any better! The benchmark I've learned, with recruiters, is how long the company has been in business, and WHO they do placements for. Companies that deal poorly with their candidates don't last very long because the word starts to get around to both candidates AND potential new clients. Lastly, I hate to mention this, but it's worthwhile. Watch out for companies that offer contract gigs and that push hard the fact that they can offer H1-B status to foreign employees. Often, but not always, these are people that have been in the States only a few years and they do a lot of dirty business, even to their "own". Watch out for these guys, EVEN if you're only looking for full-time. Best of luck.
