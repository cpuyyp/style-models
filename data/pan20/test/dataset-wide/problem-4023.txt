where $G$ is a finite group, and $\mathbb{k}$ is a field of positive characteristic. My question has to do with the part "...is generated as a triangulated category...". Because I couldn't find it out inside the book a definition or explanation of it, can you please explain me what does that mean? References are welcomed too. 

Assume that $\mathcal{C}$ is a small category and that $\mathcal{F} \in \mathsf{ob(Ab^{\mathsf{C}})}$, is a covariant functor. When our category has finitely many objects then a classical theorem from Mitchell allows us to identify in that case the category of repesenations of $\mathsf{C}$, $\mathsf{Ab^{\mathsf{C}}}$ with $R\mathsf{C}-\mathsf{mod}$, where by $R\mathsf{C}$ is denoted the category algebra (defined as the free $R$-module, generated by the morphisms of $\mathsf{C}$). However, in the latter case we can define the $i$-th cohomology of $\mathsf{C}$, to be $H^{i}(\mathsf{C}, M) := {Ext^i_{R\mathsf{C}}}(\underline{R}, M)$, and exploit the intuition given by $R\mathsf{C}-\mathsf{mod}$, which is just a category of modules. However, the assumption of $\mathsf{C}$ being with finite objects is quite restrictive (mostly applied when the category is induced by a group $G$), hence I was thinking, is there any other definition with this assumption "chopped off"? A paper by Fei Xu - On the cohomology Rings of Small Categories, seems to be a standard source for this material, however I wasn't able to understand the definition he provides for the cohomology, since he uses the notion of $n$-th higher inverse limit $\varprojlim^n_{\mathsf{C}} \mathcal{F}$, which doesn't seem quite familiar to me. So, if someone wants to give an alternative (provided it exists) definition, or to give me a reference/definition of this higher inverse limit is more than welcome. P.S. I'm familiar with the notion of higher inverse limit in general, which by definition is the right derived functor of the left exact functor $\varprojlim$, but the above higher limit is something obscure to me and haven't confronted it before. Thank you! 

EDIT : Olivier Wittenberg pointed out to me that a positive answer to the question follows from Theorem 1 of [Altman-Kleiman, Bertini theorems for hypersurface sections containing a subscheme]. I keep below my previous answer (whose argument is different, but more complicated). 

The description of the Hilbert scheme of complete intersections (obtained by taking in an iterative way open subsets of grassmannian bundles, as explained in the answer above) may be found in part 2.2 of my thesis $URL$ If the distinct degrees are $\delta_1<\dots<\delta_r$, at the $i$-th step you construct a grassmannian bundle corresponding to choosing the equations of degree $\delta_i$ up to multiples of the equations of lower degree, and you remove the closed locus where your equations do not define a complete intersection. Note that this space is smooth. It is not complete unless $k=1$. However, the construction above provides an explicit compactification if $d_1\leq d_2=\dots=d_k$. This compactification is studied in part 2 of arXiv:1111.1589. The Picard group of this Hilbert scheme is easy to describe (its rank increases by one with each grassmannian bundle and it is not changed when removing the small closed loci).The class of the discriminant in this Picard group (i.e. the degrees of the discriminant) is calculated in arXiv:1009.0704 Théorème 1.3, building on Gel'fand, Kapranov and Zelevinsky's work. 

A sufficient condition is that there should exist a closed orbit of maximal dimension (i.e. of dimension $\dim(G)$). Indeed, when it is the case, the stable locus is nonempty, and the image of the stable locus in $X/G$ is an open subset of $X/G$ of dimension $\dim(X)-\dim(G)$. This happens for instance if $G$ acts properly on $X$ (in this case all orbits are closed of maximal dimension). It will not be possible to give a nice necessary and sufficient condition, because the property $\dim(X/G)=\dim(X)-\dim(G)$ is not a very natural one in this context. For example, it does not imply that the action is faithful : take $G=\mathbb{G}_m\times\mathbb{G}_m$ acting on $X=\mathbb{A}^2$ by $(s,t)\cdot(x,y)=(sx,sy)$. 

I remember in 1978 my Dad finished his thesis (in philosophy); my Mom typed it, but there were a few places where he needed to draw in some symbolic logic symbols. "That's a great horseshoe!" he said. 

The $f$-localization I mean is the one described and studied in detail in the book by E. D. Farjoun; $L_f$ is a homotopy idempotent functor which associates to each space $X$ an $f$-equivalence $X\to L_f(X)$ where $L_f(X)$ is $f$-local. $f$-localization has a kind of uniqueness: if $F$ is some other coaugmented functor with the property that $F(X)$ is $f$-local for every $X$ (I'm happy to assume that $F = L_g$ for some map $g$), then there is a commutative square of functors and natural transformations, which I don't know how to draw here. The square would show that the composites $$ id \xrightarrow{\iota} L_f \xrightarrow{L_f(j)} L_f\circ F \qquad \mathrm{and} \qquad id \xrightarrow{j} F \xrightarrow{\iota_F} L_f \circ F $$ are equal. And $\iota_F$ is a weak equivalence for every space $X$; thus $F$ factors through $L_f$ `up to weak equivalence'. My Question: Suppose $X\to Y$ is an $f$-equivalence; then $L_f(X) \to L_f(Y)$ is a weak equivalence; does it follow that $(L_f\circ F)(X) \to (L_f\circ F)(Y)$ is a weak equivalence? 

Homogeneous spaces tend to be buildable from spheres in finitely many steps by extensions by fibrations. If you pretend you understand $[X, S^n]$ for all $n$, then you can try to analyze the exact sequences that result from your fibrations. 

These $2$-spheres are called 'twistor lines'. They indeed cover the moduli space (in the non-polarized case) : more precisely, any two points of the moduli space may be linked by a chain of twistor lines. A reference where this is nicely explained (and used !) is Huybrecht's Bourbaki talk about Verbitsky's Torelli theorem : $URL$ More precisely, Definition 3.3 gives a lattice-theoretic definition of twistor lines, the link with your description of twistor lines is made in paragraph 4.4, and the result I mentionned above is Proposition 3.7. In the polarized case, no twistor line is included in the moduli space, as a general member is not projective : see remark 8.1 of $URL$ This article is particularly interesting in this respect. Indeed, Charles and Markman prove the standard conjectures for some projective hyperkähler varieties (a statement peculiar to projective varieties) using deformations along a twistor line (hence using non-projective varieties). 

Suppose you weaken your first condition by only requiring that the structure sheaf $\mathcal{O}_X$ belongs to $\mathcal{S}$. Then the corresponding result does not hold in general. For instance, you could take $X=\mathbb{P}^1$ and $\mathcal{S}$ to be the class of globaly generated coherent sheaves on $X$, that is sheaves that are finite direct sums of $\mathcal{O}(i)$, $i\geq 0$ and torsion coherent sheaves. You can check by hand that this class satisfies your three last conditions. For this reason, to answer your question, you have to find a way to construct non-trivial vector bundles on $X$ (and this seems of course difficult). 

Assume that $\mathsf{C}$ is a small category (in my case with finitely many objects but this is probably irrelevant). In a paper I'm studying at the moment there is a notion used constantly, this of $\pi_1(\mathsf{C})$. This is some kind of (probably!!) fundamental groupoid occurring in that context , but I don't really know what it is and there is no additional information concerning it. Could you please give me a clue (or a reference)? 

In the book "Cohomology Rings of Finite Groups", by Carlson- Townsley - Elizondo there is the following corollary 

I am interested in understanding (at least roughly, if no such a description exists) the group of automorphisms for the group $UT(n,p)$, of unitriangular matrices over the field $\mathbb{F}_p$ on $p$-elements. Unfortunately the online searching I've carried out wasn't quite helpful. If no description exists, maybe some information how the automorphisms behave on the set of subgroups of it may be helpful too. For instance when $n=3$, I know we have that any $\phi \in Aut(UT(3,p))$, permutes the pairs of non-commuting elements of $UT(3,p)$ (which in that case happens always to be a generating set) and the subgroups of order $p^2$. So am wondering if something similar exists (of course modified somehow) in the general case too. If the above sounds quite general, the case where $n=4$, is of great importance for me either. Any comment might be useful, and of course references too. Thanks! 

The new edition of SGA3 by Philippe Gille et Patrick Polo provides a connected example due to Raynaud. It is in SGA3 Exposé VIA Exemples 1.3.2 (2) and you may find it at $URL$ This example is $2$-dimensional, but it is easy to modify it to get a $1$-dimensional example if the characteristic of the base field is at least $3$. More precisely, let $G$ be defined by the equations $X^p-tY^p=Y^p-tZ^p=0$ in the additive group $\mathbb{G}_a^3$ over the field $\mathbb{F}_p(t)$, $p\neq 2$. Then $G$ is a connected group scheme of dimension $1$ whose reduction is not a subgroup scheme, as may be seen by following step by step the arguments of loc. cit. 

Yes, there is such an example in [Choi, Positive semidefinite biquadratic forms, §4]. It is proven there that the polynomial $$x^4+y^4-2(x^2+y^2)zw+z^2w^2+2(x^2z^2+y^2w^2)$$ is positive semidefinite, but not a sum of squares. 

I do not know the answer to the question. However, let me point out that the answer is negative if you look for surfaces avoiding more points. More precisely, there exists a smooth complete threefold that does not satisfy Sándor's property $NC_{10}$: it contains 10 points that cannot be simultaneously avoided by a divisor. In [Fujino - Payne, Smooth complete toric threefolds with no nontrivial nef line bundles], the authors construct varieties as indicated in the title. Their best example $X$ has Picard rank $5$, and they show that it is optimal. Now, the property that $X$ has no nontrivial nef line bundle is equivalent to the fact that the cone of effective curves is the whole vector space $N_1(X)$ of $1$-cycles up to numerical equivalence. Since this vector space is $5$-dimensional, it will be possible to find $10$ integral curves $C_1,\dots,C_{10}$ on $X$ spanning this vector space as a cone (see [Davis, Theory of positive linear dependance, Theorem 6.7]). Choose a point $P_i$ in $C_i$. I claim that no surface in $X$ avoids all the $P_i$. Indeed, such a surface $S$ would intersect non-negatively the $C_i$, hence any curve. This is obviously impossible: working in an affine neighbourhood of a point of $S$, one constructs a curve intersecting $S$ positively. Note that in Fujino and Payne's precise example, it should be possible to find less than $10$ integral curves spanning $N_1(X)$ as a cone, but certainly not less than $6$ curves. Finally, toric varieties are never going to provide counter-examples to your original question, as any two points in a toric variety have a common affine neighbourhood.
