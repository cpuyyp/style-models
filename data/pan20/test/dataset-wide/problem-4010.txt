So we get examples choosing $F_1$ abelian and $F_2$ non-abelian, of the same order, e.g., 6 or 8. $[1]$ R. Bryant. The verbal topology of a group.

Yes. Let $F$ be a nonabelian f.g. free group, then $F\times F$ has this property. Indeed, for each normal subgroup $N$ of $F$, denote $H_N$ the subgroup $\{(x,y), xN=yN\}$ of $F\times F$ (this is a fibre product $F\times_{F/N} F$). Then $H_N$ contains the normal subgroup $N\times N$, and the quotient $H_N/(N\times N)$ is isomorphic to $F/N$. This normal subgroup can be intrinsically defined in $H_N$, because it is generated by $N\cup\{1\}\cup \{1\}\times N$, which is the set of elements of $H_N$ whose centralizer in $H_N$ is nonabelian. Hence the isomorphism class of $H_N$ determines the isomorphism class of $F/N$. Moreover, if $F/N$ is simple then $H_N$ is maximal in $F\times F$. Since there are uncountably many non-isomorphic 2-generated simple groups, we deduce that $F\times F$ has uncountably many non-isomorphic maximal subgroups. 

Let $K$ be a field, $V$ a finite-dimensional vector space, $T$ an operator of $V$. Consider the endomorphism $b_T$ of $V\otimes V$ (all $\otimes$ are over $K$) given by $$x\otimes y\mapsto b_T(x\otimes y)=x\otimes y-Ty\otimes x.$$ Then I claim that $b_T$ is an automorphism (or equivalently surjective) if and only if all the following hold: (a) 1 is not eigenvalue of $T$; (b) $-1$ is not double eigenvalue of $T$ [that is, $\dim(\mathrm{Ker}(1-T))\le 1$]; (c) $T$ has no pair of distinct inverse eigenvalues (in any extension field of $K$). Since both the problem and the characterization ignore field extension, it is enough to prove this when $K$ is algebraically closed; we do it by induction on $d=\dim(V)$; the case $d=0$ being trivial, assume $d\ge 1$. Write $b_T=b_{V,T}$. Fix an eigenline $E\subset V$ of $T$. It yields a $b_T$-stable $(2d-1)$-dimensional subspace $W=(E\otimes V+V\otimes E)$ of $V\otimes V$. So $\det(b_T)=\det((b_T)|_{W})\det(b_{V/E,T})$, because the endomorphism of $(V\otimes V)/W$ induced by $T$ can be identified with $b_{V/E,T}$. So we have to compute this first determinant $\det((b_T)|_{W})$. Let $(e_1,\dots,e_d)$ be a basis of $V$ with $e_1\in E$ and $Te_1=\lambda e_1$. Then a basis of $W$ is given by $$(e_1\otimes e_1,e_2\otimes e_1,\dots e_d\otimes e_1,e_1\otimes e_2,\dots e_1\otimes e_d).$$ Writing matrices by blocks $1+(d-1)+(d-1)$, we see that the matrix of $(b_T)|_{W}$ in this basis is $$\begin{pmatrix}1-\lambda & 0 & *\\ 0 & I & -T'\\0 & -\lambda I & I\end{pmatrix},$$ where $T'$ is the matrix of the endomorphism induced by $T$ on $V/E$ on the basis $(e_2,\dots,e_d)$. The determinant of $(b_T)|_{W}$ is therefore $(1-\lambda)\det(1-\lambda T')$. Thus the determinant of $b_T$ is $$\det(b_T)=(1-\lambda)\det(1-\lambda T')\det(b_{V/E,T}).$$ From this formula, we can deduce the result. First, for the easy implication: if $1$ is eigenvalue as in (a), pick $\lambda=1$ and then $\det(b_T)=0$. If there are two inverse eigenvalues with independent eigenvectors (this covers (b) and (c)), then pick $\lambda$ to be one of them, and then since $\lambda^{-1}$ is an eigenvalue of $T'$, we have $\det(1-\lambda T')=0$ and hence $\det(b_T)=0$. Conversely, assume that none of (i),(ii),(iii) holds. By induction and using (i)-(ii)-(iii), $\det(b_{V/E,T})\neq 0$. Also $\det(1-\lambda T')\neq 0$: this is clear if $\lambda=0$, and if $\lambda\neq 0$ we know from (ii),(iii) that $\lambda^{-1}$ is not eigenvalue of $T'$. Finally $\lambda\neq 1$ by (i) and hence $\det(b_T)\neq 0$. 

There's an application, of the slight improvement of these results to locally compact groups, which yields, for instance that many virtually free groups do not have proper cocompact isometric actions on the same proper metric space. It requires 1) the generalization of Stallings to locally compact groups, which essentially consists in replacing a Cayley graph by a vertex-transtive (locally finite connected) graph, which was done by Abels in 1974, and 2) the extension of Dunwoody's result to simply connected vertex-transitive 2-complexes, which is a straightfoward extension of his argument, and was observed by Mosher-Sageev-Whyte (who also obtained this application). The outcome is that if 2 virtually free f.g. groups have proper cocompact isometric actions on a single proper metric space, then they also have proper cocompact action on a single tree, and the latter can be discarded by easy Bass-Serre theory arguments, e.g. for $C_2*C_3$ and $C_2*C_5$ where $C_k$ is cyclic of order $k$. 

Lemma: if $Z$ is an infinitely generated abelian group, then $Z$ has an infinite torsion quotient. Proof: let $B$ be a maximal free subgroup. Then $Z/B$ is torsion. If $B$ is finitely generated then $Z/B$ is infinite. Otherwise, choose an infinite subset $(e_n)_{n\ge 1}$ in $B$ and replace $e_n$ by $ne_n$ for all $n$, to obtain a smaller free subgroup $B'$, with $B/B'$ infinite torsion; then $Z/B'$ is infinite torsion. 

This is true. I change the notation for convenience: let $F_1,F_2$ be two free groups (on any number of generators). Let a subgroup $H$ of $F_1\times F_2$ not contain any direct product of two non-abelian free groups. Then $H$ is coherent. Proof: let $P_i$ be the projection of $H$ on $F_i$, and $J_i=H\cap F_i$. Note that $J_i$ is normal in $P_i$, and $H$ induces an isomorphism $J_1/P_1\simeq J_2/P_2$. Then $H$ contains $J_1\times J_2$, hence at least one of $J_1$ and $J_2$, say $J_2$, is abelian (hence cyclic). We have two cases: 

I wrote a paper about the space of ideals in a commutative ring (or more generally submodules of a module over a commutative ring): $URL$ I focused on the case of finitely generated commutative rings, because, in the general case, the pointwise convergence seems not to be the most natural one, see the discussion in Section 5 of the paper, and also because my motivation was to deal with f.g. metabelian groups, that I consider in $URL$ As Benjamin mentions, these constructions are particular cases of general abstract constructions known by people in model theory and others, and the contribution of the above papers is to obtain precise description of the homeomorphism type of certain of these objects.
