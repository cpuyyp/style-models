Yes, teams agree to play in the games, presumably for a significant portion of the proceeds (though that, as with most things in the NFL, isn't made public). The reasons vary; for example, teams with small home stadiums and/or difficulty selling out seats will likely make a profit, as Wembley Stadium is reasonably large and typically sells over 80,000 seats per game, buying relatively expensive tickets ($150-$200 depending on the exchange rate, which is on par for a large-market team and more than smaller market teams will typically get). That's why teams like Jacksonville and Tampa Bay agree to do this, as they have relatively light attendance and can't charge as much for tickets. Presumably you also have higher jersey sales around the game in the UK; a lot of folks I know in the UK became Bucs fans after the first few games there. See the wikipedia page for more information and links to other sources. As far as the downsides, the jet lag isn't all that bad; 6 hours from the east coast to London versus 3 hours to Seattle, and the other team has it just as bad or worse. You also get a slightly favorable schedule around that game (no Sunday-Thursday or Monday-Sunday, and they often coincide with bye weeks afterwards). 

NFL Rulebook, Rule 7, Section 2: Dead Ball covers this. There is no specific rule regarding safeties, because there's no need for one: forward progress applies. 

The Baltimore Chop is so named because its origins were in the late 1800s Baltimore Orioles. This blog post by Roar34 discusses it in some detail, along with the other antics the Orioles got up to back then. Unfortunately the article that blog post references doesn't seem to exist anymore (an article by Dr. David Haus of Bowling Green). Baseball Reference's definition also agrees with that origin (and the general concepts of the definition below). A Baltimore Chop is a ball hit into play that is hit nearly directly down, typically landing right in front of the plate, and then bouncing fairly high up, preventing the catcher from instantly fielding it (and possibly going, slowly, towards the other infielders). According to the post above, the original Chop was a result of the Orioles placing cement in that part of the infield (under the dirt) to cause higher bounces. This was primarily effective in the 'dead ball' era, and post-1919 there are better ways to get singles. 

This is starting to head into territory that might be better handled at CrossValidated, but it's interesting here nonetheless. One concept that's important in statistics is that even if a random variable is not normally distributed (could be uniform, binomial, gamma, who knows), a sample of its means will be normally distributed. Thus, while you cannot assume that a random sample of 50 at-bats from a player will appear normal, you can assume that if you take 50 samples of 50 samples that they will be approximately normally distributed, assuming the basis for the data doesn't change over time. This, of course, isn't an assumption you can make over a long period of time - 2500 at bats I'm sure a player will change over - but over a shorter period of time you probably can, if the player doesn't get injured and isn't in the very beginning or very end of his career. This is used by assuming a player's performance that year/etc. is a random sample from the inferential (but imaginary) population of all at-bats he might take, which would define his 'true' ability level. If a player is batting .280, then the odds of his true ability level being .300 or .260 under a naïve assumption would be identically likely (and, based on the sample size, could be determined.) Further, you could use other samples of his batting ability (say, he batted .250 last year, and .270 the year before that, and .230 the year before that) to determine what the likely overall skill level is - again assuming, naïvely, that his skill level is constant. In this example, the .280 sounds like an outlier on the high end - a hot streak, so to speak - since his performance has fluctuated up and down around an average of .260 or so. However, that's a very naïve assumption, and is certainly well behind where we stand in sports analytics. The normal distribution assumption is still present in certain elements, but various people have used a much more powerful tool to determine what factors have predictive value as to future performance in other areas than simply a mean of batting averages. Among other things, with just a simple confidence interval, you can't assume batting average has any effect on other elements of performance (including scoring runs, etc.); instead, sports statisticians have used various forms of regression analysis to determine how the different statistics available correlate with important performance elements (particularly, scoring runs, preventing runs from scoring, and winning games, for baseball as an example). That gives you more ability to identify whether a player is likely on a hot streak, or whether his performance has truly improved - separating the Mike Trouts of the world from the Chris Davises. 

Absent a specific instruction in the referee's handbook, it's unlikely to be clarified further than that (unless the Big Ten chooses to clarify it further themselves, which they may or may not). 

If you want to look solely at the outcomes, well, there have been fewer than 100 overtime games since 2012, so it shouldn't be too hard to just count them? 

There is no explicit prohibition in Rule 3 (equipment) to fielders wearing 'armor', though it does require uniforms with certain minimum standards (visible 6" number, for example) which may be challenging to accomplish while wearing armor. 

This data is still fairly flaky; I in particular am concerned about the 1999 blip, which while I can't see any evidence of it being wrong is ... strange. Only two valid KR-TDs seems to me to be very odd compared to the other seasons (no other season in that era under 8, and none even post-2010 under 6). (There should probably be a third included, though I can't see a legitimate data-driven way to include it without reviewing every single return; the Music City Miracle is not included as PFR lists it as a 1 yard kick return.) Either way, I would caution against using only recent data if you're trying to evaluate the Super Bowl history of kick returns; since post-2010 the number of touchbacks rose so dramatically, the return numbers dropped in concert for kickoffs, while punts have had no significant rule changes in recent years. Punts are also very vulnerable to individuals bumping the numbers significantly with 2+ returns in a season: note the spike in 2002-03, the longer crest in 2006-2008 and return in 2011, for example. This may have some impact on the Super Bowl, as punt returners can be kicked away from, but kick returners cannot. 1 Specifically, I try to account for fumbles and other returns that are not of the conventional sort. For kicks I attempt to remove onside kicks returned for touchdowns by either team and fumbled kicks returned by the kicking team; for punts I attempt to remove muffed or fumbled punts returned by the kicking team and blocked punts returned by the receiving team. I remove any KR that is under 60 yards in total distance, or any return that includes "fumble" in the text (though none do with >60 KRYds). I remove any PR that is from a punt under 20 yards or any punt return that is under 30 yards but has a number in the PRYds field (as the entire 1998 season has no numbers for some reason), or any punt whose play by play includes 'fumble' or 'muff' and yields less than 30 PRYds (I checked by hand, none of the 1998 punts were caught by this). This ultimately removes 19 KRTDs and 21 PRTDs from the data. 

In the process of answering Brett's question, I found a slightly better answer for this one. In the MLB Rulebook, rule 7.01 (Regulation Games), there is an approved ruling specifically relevant here, below (g) (3). 

Yes, an eligible receiver-by-number may play in an ineligible position, similarly to how an ineligible player-by-number may line up in an eligible position. In both cases, they must report to the referee, who will then report it over the intercom or simply directly to the defensive huddle (though, usually over the intercom), and will do so each down the player remains in the game (and the player must report each down). Rule 5-3-1 states this: 

Just to be clear, you cannot "go for an and one". And one means you're getting the continuation, which is where you are in the middle of a shot, fouled, but the ball went into the basked in that shot you were in the middle of. At least in theory, if you're changing your action after the foul, it's not a continuation so it isn't an "and one" situation. (In practice that may not always be the case, of course.) So if a second player fouls you while you're doing that, odds are it's not a dead ball foul, but simply a foul, and you'll get one foul called (whichever they notice first or is worse) and one shot/pair of shots. That's assuming the second fouler initiated their play before the whistle (not making contact before the whistle, but starting the action that leads to the contact - jumping up, running full speed, whatever). The player would have to initiate contact after the whistle (and probably a bit after the whistle, given reaction time) in order for it to count as a dead ball foul and get the technical free throws. 

The batter may only advance to first base on a dropped third strike. A foul tip may never become a dropped third strike, as if it is dropped it is treated as a regular foul ball (and thus is not in play), and if it is caught it is not dropped (and thus the batter is simply out). The runner already on base may steal on a foul tip since he is already on base, and thus may treat a foul tip like any other pitch (the ball is in play). But the batter would be out as soon as the foul tip was caught and therefore could not advance. 

SLG is the expected value of total bases ("TB") of an at-bat. You would use it slightly differently from batting average, since it's measuring a different thing. Let's see some examples. 

Thus, not only must seven men be on the line, but those seven must be the 5 ineligible receivers (the offensive line, who may not be the first to touch a pass, and must stay behind the line on passing plays prior to the pass being thrown) with one eligible receiver on each side of them. You'll hear fouls periodically saying "The receiver was covering up the tight end" and similar, which means a WR was on the line and a TE inside of that WR was off the line (typically because the TE went in motion and the two of them didn't properly reset). That helps the defense, as they then know which five players they don't have to cover in pass defense. Otherwise it would sometimes be confusing as to which of the 6 linemen was eligible without looking at their numbers (which isn't always possible when they're in their stance). 

However, they do define a fielder's choice to include the traditional Defensive Indifference, as in the NCAA (and MLB) rules: 

The keys to taking a charge are anticipation, speed, and attention to detail. Anticipation refers to knowing where the ball is and knowing where the players are moving to, before they do. In order to take a charge, you have to get to where the offensive player is going a little bit ahead of him in order to plant yourself (two feet, square body) before he gets there. You can't take a charge if you're not there first, after all. You also need to anticipate the right point to take the charge: where is the offensive player going to be the most out of control, and thus least able to avoid you. That could be as he goes for a layup and is going to elevate, it could be as he is turning blindly, it could be as he avoids weakside help. Speed is also necessary. You have to be quick to get to that spot on the floor- if you take a long time to get there, the offensive player will see you and avoid you. Finally, attention to detail is necessary to plant yourself properly and take the charge, and not get called for a defensive blocking foul. Refs tend to call blocking when it's questionable, so the best players at taking a charge do so in an exaggerated manner (not a flop, but they plant themselves very carefully). They also do that because it helps them avoid the pain from taking the charge - you have a 200 pound person (+/- 50 pounds) barreling into you at speed, that is going to hurt. Carefully planting yourself so that your chest takes the shoulder of the offensive player, and then falling in such a way that you take most of the contact with the floor on your buttocks rather than on your back or arm is important to avoiding injury and too much bruising. Shane Battier, one of the greats at taking charges, has a Youtube Video that some of this comes from, and he shows you nicely how to take a charge, as well as live pictures of himself and some other greats taking charges in real games. You can also read the NBA Block/Charge rulings which explain what is supposed to be called one versus the other. Knowing these rules and associated rulings are important, because what you're allowed to do as a defender varies by location on the floor and what the offensive player is doing. 

and are what you want to look at; those are the location on the floor. X is left-right along the endline with 0 centered at the basket (negative numbers left of the basket if the basket is on the bottom of the chart), and Y is positive towards halfcourt with 0 being at the basket (so very small negative numbers are possible, since the basket hangs just over the baseline). See this R tutorial for more information. The NBA doesn't actually suggest people use these data, so they don't publish a glossary, but this page does a good job of explaining it. The latitude/longitude I suspect is useless information; the values are approximately equal to Los Angeles's Lat/Lon even when playing an away game, so they really make no sense.
