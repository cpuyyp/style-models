In Raynaud's paper "Specialisation du foncteur de Picard", Theorem 3.3.1 says that algebraic group spaces, which are locally of finite type and separated over any locally noetherian normal 1-dim scheme, are group schemes. On the other hand, relative Picard functors for proper flat finite presentation schemes $f:X\rightarrow S$ over DVR such that $f$ is cohomologically flat are represented by algebraic sapces, but are often not schemes, see also that paper or the book Neron Model. 

How far is it to extend the results of SGA III Exp. VIB from group schemes to group spaces? In particular, does Corollary 4.4 from SGA III Exp. VIB hold for G/S being merely a group space? Here the base $S$ is still a scheme. Is there any reference for group spaces? I checked stack project, but the section 'properties of group algebraic spaces' from Chapter "groupoids in alg. sp." is less than 1 page. Raynaud's IHES paper contains a few pages. To be more precise, I would like to know if the following is ture: Let $G/S$ be group space locally of finite presentation with $S$ a trait (to make it easier), let $s,t$ be the closed point and generic point of $S$ respectively. Suppose $G_s$ and $G_t$ are smooth over $k(s)$ and $k(t)$ respectively, and $\mathrm{dim}G_s=\mathrm{dim}G_t$. Then the functor $G^0$ (defined as in SGA III Exp. VI B Def. 3.1) is represented by a smooth group scheme over $S$. 

Peano's axioms are categorical if you take the second order formulation, i.e. no non-standard models. If you replace the second order axiom by a first order axiom scheme, they cease being categorical by the compactness theorem, as Francois stated. If you embed the second order version into a first-order model of set they, they remain categorical relative to the set theory, but the set theory itself has non-standard models. Non-standard models are useful because they help us formalize some features of infinitary processes, i.e. non-standard analysis, geometric group theory, etc. In practice, model theorists would usually have way more structure than simply Peano's axioms, such as a real closed field or hyperbolic group. 

I've a graph whose edges are weighted by probabilities, perhaps all equal. I would like to compute the overall probability of traveling between vertices x and y in the graph after I delete each edge vw with probability 1-p(vw). In other words, I'm trying to understand the probability that a self-avoiding walk goes from v to w. I cannot simply look at powers of the weighted adjacency matrix because this includes cycles. I've gleaned from the self-avoiding walks literature that computing this probability should be NP-complete, although maybe I've miss-understood something there. Approximation algorithms might exist however. Anyone seen one? I could imagine some recent-path-dependent ring-like object that when used in the adjacency matrix power operation eliminates counting short cycles. If the probabilities were low enough, this might produce a reasonable approximation with sane running time, although other properties of the graph might enter into the picture too. 

Given a totally degenerated abelian variety $A_K$ (to make it easier) over a complete discrete valuation field $K$ with $R$, $\pi$ and $k$ the corresponding discrete valuation ring, uniformiser and residue field. Let $S=\mathrm{Spec}R$ and $S_n=\mathrm{Spec} R/(\pi)^{n+1}$. For any $S$-scheme $V$ we denote the scheme $V\times_S S_n$ as $V_n$. In particular, $A_K$ has semistable reduction, $A_K$ extends to a semiabelian scheme $G$ over $S=\mathrm{Spec} R$, and the corresponding Raynaud extension is just a torus $T$ over $S$, analytically $A_K=T_K/Y_K$, and we have a pairing $Y_K\times X_K\rightarrow \mathbb{G}_{m,K}$, where $Y_K$ is the periods lattice and $X$ is the character group of $T$. Moreover, we assume both $X$ and $Y$ (the character group of the Raynaud extension associated to the dual abelian variety $A_K^{\vee}$ which gives $Y_K$) are free $\mathbb{Z}$-modules. Starting from this, we can construction lots of projective models of $A_K$ by using Mumford's construction, see Mumford compositio 1972, Faltings-Chai's book, the 1999 Tohoku paper of Aleexev and Nakamura. Given a nice (being nice see [Mum1973]section 6) $Y_K$-invariant polyhedral decomposition $\Sigma$ of the affine space $E=\mathrm{Hom}(X,\mathbb{Q})$, we can construct a projective model $P_{\Sigma}$ of $A_K$ and cut out the semiabelian scheme $G$ from $P_{\Sigma}$. Over $S_n$ we have group action $G_n\times_{S_n} P_{\Sigma,n}\rightarrow P_{\Sigma,n}$. Now the question is: could we have an action of $G$ on $P_{\Sigma}$ which extends the group operation on $G$ and the actions on the infinitesimal fibres? It seems to me in Aleexev's 2002 Annals paper, the answer is yes, at least for certain canonical models obtained from a given theta divisor of some ample line bundle (since $A_K$ extends to a stable semiabelic scheme over $S$ once you are given a ample line bundle on $A_K$, and being a stable semiabelic scheme implies you have an action on the model, see Theorem 5.7.1 case 2 in that paper), but I couldn't find a concrete argument for this in the paper. Could anyone help me point out where the hidden argument is? Or give me some other reference. I know in dimension $1$ case, the paper by Deligne and Rapoport describes this action in order to define generalised elliptic curves via a different approach (using $\mathrm{Pic}^0$), but seems not easy to generalise to hight dimensional case. 

As a rule, you cannot depend upon math papers making every dependency explicit, meaning you cannot extract nearly so much information from this directed graph as you imagine. In addition, there isn't any reason this graph should be acyclic since forward references frequently get used in outlines and motivational text. That said, there are use cases like identifying all the backwards references. For example, you could find all backwards commands using this perl script I call : 

Is there a good reference for information about the second homotopy group of the Cayley complex or Presentation complex of a finitely presented group, especially a hyperbolic group? I'm looking for an argument that the second homotopy group of the Cayley complex of a hyperbolic group $G$ is finitely generated as a $G$-module in particular, but I'd welcome other interesting starting points around the second homotopy group of the Cayley complex too. 

I think the 'status' might be described as : Pillay has shown using used Selah's work that the free group is not CM-trivial. All known counterexamples to Zilber's conjecture are CM-trivial. A non-abelian simple group of finite Morley rank is not CM-trivial. We therefore suspect that the current methods based upon Hrushovski's counterexamples cannot produce even an infinite rank counterexample who is a simple group. 

In Lemma 1.8, "the equation that cut out the cone at the vertex $(c,A(c))$ are $$x_0-A(c)\geq dA(\alpha(\sigma))(x)"$$ should the equations be $$"x_0-A(c)\geq dA(\alpha(\sigma))(x-c)" ????$$ "then the interior normal in the dual space $X^{\ast}_{\mathbb{R}}\oplus\mathbb{R}$ to the corresponding facet is $(1,-dA(\alpha(\sigma)))$", should this be "$(-dA(\alpha(\sigma)),1)$"??? In the same page, "Definition 1.10 We will denote the minimum of the functions $dA\alpha((\sigma))(x)$ in the above lemma by $\eta(x,c)$." Should we define $\eta(x,c)$ to be the maximum of the fuctions $dA\alpha((\sigma))(x)$???? 

Let $f:X\rightarrow Y$ be a morphism of schemes (or algebraic spaces), and $s:Y\rightarrow X$ is a section to $f$, i.e. $fs=1_{Y}$. Question: Is $s$ an (closed) immersion? 

Is there anyone familiar with this paper? It seems to me it contains "some" typos and even some small elementary mistakes, which makes my reading very slow. Of course the key reason for my slow reading is I wasn't familiar with Faltings and Chai's book, from which the paper use the notations and results. Maybe I have some (or many) misunderstanding. I hope someone could help me clear up my confusions: 

Allows new solutions to be found in regular tunable time intervals, Is memory hard so that specialized ASICs cannot speed up the computations, and Any significantly faster algorithms represent the sort of dramatic advancement that it'd emerge from across the mathematical community simultaneously and not from a secret project. 

Apologies if this answer is nitpicky and diverges slightly from the questions intent, but this particular soft question appears to warrant a soft answer. Implicit in your term "mathcoin" are assumptions that the problem: 

You'll find this handles multiple filename arguments correctly because the last line resets the line number $.` when appropriate. There is considerably more you can do using scripting languages with built in regular expressions. I've written a chcite script which changes all your \cite commands for switching between different co-authors .bib files, for example. 

We have $\sum_x (y_x - ax-b)^2 = \sum_x y_x^2 - 2a \sum_x x y_x - 2b \sum_x y_x + \sum_x (ax+b)^2$ so the only term requiring $O(n)$ time per shift is $\sum_x x y_x$ because an easy $O(1)$ time trick handles the other terms involving $y_x$. In this term, you can decrement $x$ in $O(1)$ time too because $\sum_x (x-1) y_x = \sum_x x y_x - \sum_x y_x$, heck you must store $\sum_x y_x$ anyways. After that, you could simply employ the same obvious $O(1)$ time slide trick you used for $\sum_x y_x^2$ and $\sum_x y_x$. In fact, you need not do anything too special if terms slide off when $x=0$, i.e. you initially added $k y_x$ and subtracted off one $y_x$ per round. 

Is an algebraic space over a DVR, whose special fibre (and all its infinitesimal neighborhood) and generic fibre are schemes, actually a scheme? 

It is said so in Knutson's book 'algebraic sapces' in several places for different topologies on schemes, see Chapt. I, 2.19 for Zariski top, 3.13 for flat top., 4.11 for etale topology. But this seems to be clearly wrong to me. For example, let $f$ be the identity from $P^1$ to itself which is clearly surjective, consider the Zariski open covering $A^1\cup A^1\rightarrow X=P^1$, then $A^1\rightarrow X$ is not surjective. 

should be not true! What is the cokernel of the map $\mathbb{Z}\rightarrow A$ with $A$ an abelian variety and $\mathbb{Z}$ the constant group scheme represented by the ring of integers? But if you consider only commutative algebraic group scheme over a field $k$(i.e. of finite type over $k$), then it should be abelian. 

I am interested in the following example! Let $k$ be a field, let $X_0$ be the scheme $\mathrm{Spec}R$ with $R_0=k[x,y]/(xy)$, let $R$ be the strict Hensilian localalisation of $R_0$ at the origin and $X=\mathrm{Spec}R$, we define a sheaf $F$ on $X$ by $F(U)=\mathbb{Z}^2$ or $\mathbb{Z}$ for $U$ open in $X$ depending on if $U$ contains the origin or not (hence the stalk of $F$ is $\mathbb{Z}^2$ at the origin, and $\mathbb{Z}$ at other points). The restriction maps for defining $F$ are given by $\mathbb{Z}^2\rightarrow \mathbb{Z}:(m,n)\mapsto m+n$ (in fact the sheaf comes from the log structure associated to the embedding $X_0\subset \mathbb{A}^2$ ). Since $X$ is strict Hensilian, we have $H^1(X,F)=0$. Now consider the projection $p:\mathbb{G}_{m,R}\rightarrow X=\mathrm{Spec}R$. What would be the group $H^1(\mathbb{G}_{m,R},p^*F)$? Maybe an easier version, is $H^1(\mathbb{G}_{m,R},\mathbb{Z})$ zero? We do know $H^1(\mathbb{G}_{m},\mathbb{Z})=H^1(\mathrm{Spec}R,\mathbb{Z})=0$! 

Of course, collisions in cryptographic hashed satisfies 1 and 3, while a memory hard cryptographic hash like or satisfies 2 as well. Almost all the answers proposed here thus far fail even 1 and maybe all here fail 2. Worse, there are probably no calculations that both pass 3 and represent useful mathematical (resp. scientific) research, at least not for 2 (resp. 10) years. In short, a naive "mathcoin" as suggested here sounds impossible to do correctly. There might be less naive approaches where perhaps any problem goes and the problem's difficulty is established by previous attempts, but that's actually solving a social problem to achieve 1 with widely varied math problems as simply a source of randomness that defeats ASICs. As an aside, there are proof-of-useful-work systems that could possibly support a bitcoin like currency without wasting resources, but again they all provide useful social services like file storage (filecoin) or anonymity via onion routing. Update 2018: There is still no evidence of any suitable mathcoin problem but there are seemingly suitable science and engineering problems. Examples: Proof-of-moon: All miners must buy telescope arrays to explore the night sky looking for specific astronomical events. If you find one, then reporting it in a canonical way and hashing the report with a nonce can win a block, with the difficulty possibly adjusted by the event. Proof-of-vulnerability: All miners run advanced static analysis tools on software to discover vulnerabilities in published software. A miner wins the block with the hash specific characteristics of a vulnerability plus a nonce, so once a vulnerability is found the miner will eventually win a block. There are several challenges though: First, you must prevent a vulnerability from being used twice, potentially this could be done by resolving to a particular point in the code, but then projects with more releases become better targets. Second, static analysis tools have false positives, so you might need to test consequences somehow. Third, you'll likely need some sort of proof-of-stake system to permit humans to ultimately arbitrate the vulnerabilities. Forth, you want to tackle closed source software too, so the definition of published becomes tricky. Fifth, developers might get annoyed with vulnerabilities being posted to some blockchain without even attempting to warn them first. 

How to determine a functor (natrually arising from geometry or homological algebra) to be locally of finite presentation? Is there any reference for such staff? My example of functors underlying this question is functors of the form $$\mathcal{E}xt^1_S(A,\mathbb{G}_m)$$ for $A$ some group scheme or even some fppf-sheaf of geometric meaning over some base scheme $S$, and $\mathcal{E}xt^1_S(,)$ denotes the 1st fppf extension sheaf in the category of abelian fppf-sheaves over $S$. 

The group cohomology of cyclic groups can be computed easily due to the periodity. Now how can one compute the group cohomology $H^r(\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}\times \mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z},M)$? As least in some special case, e.g. $M$ has trivial action, or even $M=\mathbb{Z}$? I would like to know the case that $M$ is not $\mathbb{Z}$. Furthermore, can one compute $H^r(\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}\times\cdots\times \mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z},M)$? 

Let $f:X\rightarrow Y$ be a proper surjective morphism over some base scheme $S$ of finite type, suppose $f$ restricts to an isomorphism over some open $U$ of $X$, we also suppose both $X$ and $Y$ are integral for simplicity. I guess now $f$ is a covering for the cdh-topology. Now is there anyway to get an injection $$0\rightarrow \mathrm{Pic}^{\tau}_{Y/S}\rightarrow \mathrm{Pic}^{\tau}_{X/S}$$. By the way is $\mathbb{G}_m$ a sheaf for the cdh-topology? Could anyone give me a good reference for cdh topology treated in a general way instead serving only for motivic cohomology?
