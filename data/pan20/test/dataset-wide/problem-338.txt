Although Samuel's answer is succinct, it is not entirely accurate. You already realize it, but it is worth repeating that for some situations the three possibilities are indistinguishable. For instance, if you travel back in time and produce an alternate timeline, from the point of the original timeline the result is identical to the proposition that time travel is impossible - any attempt simply causes the traveler to disappear. Likewise, if changes are propagated forward, all sorts of unintended historical effects are produced. Larry Niven's Law of Time Travel suggests that for this situation the only "stable" history is one in which some combination of historical accident results in time travel "never" being invented. Finally, of course, version 2 is indistinguishable from version 1 in the new timeline. With that said, establishing the existence of time travel to any desired degree of confidence is fairly easy. You simply tell an investigator to walk to the room next door and pick up the locked metal box which he will find there. Three days later, tell him to open it and observe that it contains that day's paper, which you bought that morning, then put in a box and travelled back 3 days to place in the room. By being careful with your transport arrangements you can prevent paradox or closed loops. Repeating the process repeatedly will establish your bona fides to any desired degree of reliability, although the amount of care required to avoid the investigator cheating will be considerable. The second time you do this, the investigator is going to be tempted to open the box early and use the prescience he gains. There are ways around this, such as encrypting the box's contents and supplying the key on the day the box is to be opened, but this can produce some very tricky details to get right to both sides' satisfaction, and is very similar to the problem of transmitting encrypted data without getting spoofed by an opponent. Note - in looking over the preceding comments, I find that I am in agreement with Cort Ammon concerning "decidedly prove", although my phrasing about degrees of confidence was made without consideration of his objection. Science doesn't work by proving things, but repeated confirmation can be "close enough for all practical purposes". As in, take a gymnasium, and line up 100 teenage girls on one wall, and 100 teenage boys on the facing wall. Have each group walk half-way toward the center each time a bell rings. Theoretically, the two groups will never meet, but after a relatively small number of bells they will be close enough for all practical purposes. 

Without knowing any science or medicine? Please. Stop and think about this. Another answer suggested increasing his power base by pushing for public sanitation. Where? In the lives of the peasants? In the cities? Do you have any idea of the capital investment required to retrofit a country with water pipes? Or the technological advances needed to make those pipes on the scale required? Or the cultural changes needed to get people to actually use plumbing? Some diseases will potentially respond to sanitation (cholera, for instance, but that requires a heroic waste control effort). Others, such as the Black Death and typhus, won't. Even as late as the end of the 18th century, control of fleas was pretty much nonexistant. There exists a letter from George Washington to a young woman who will move to the big city, warning her that a high-class woman does not scratch her flea bites in public. 

This is an absolute statement which is not, so far, either correct or incorrect. So far, science seems to be doing a really great job of explaining (in the sense of coming up with rules which seem to do a good job of making predictions about) Nature (the physical universe), but there are two possible problems. First, of course, science has not yet explained everything. Second, there is no guarantee that, at some point in the future we won't come across things which cannot, by their nature, be explained. For that matter, we may even have come across them already and don't know it. Nature, on the other hand, does not explain anything to anybody, much less us. To try to translate your statement, "Nature can explain science" seems to mean that the underlying physical relationships and structures of the material universe are sufficient to produce the behavior and thought patterns which we call science. This is (to use an understatement) unproved. Trying to assert it gets you instantly into questions of theology and philosophy, and these are not what you call easy or tractable questions. 

Oh good. Finally something that makes sense. The national government is attempting to unify the efforts of the whole country on an emergency basis, which pretty much defines the condition as rule by a national government. If you mean, rule by local military forces, this means the national government has broken down and you're well into rule by local warlords. 

Democracy in 1300 is, simply, treason. Treason was dealt with by death and torture. I suggest you read about the fall of the Knights Templar (1308 - 1312) 

You need to define what you are talking about. What is a "micronation within the US"? Is it a sovereign nation or not? If Molossia is not sovereign, it is not technically a nation, micro- or otherwise. Your characterization of the head of Molossia as "the owner" suggests that Molossia is not, in fact, a nation. If it were, he would be the ruler, not the owner. Apparently you are talking about a community which calls itself a micro-nation, and has not made a sufficient nuisance of itself to get slapped down. Yet. Such a situation would not persist for more than a few years. Its inhabitants would, of course, pay no taxes to the US, and that alone would bring things to a head in a fairly short time, with the US government taking the position that Molossia is, in fact, a cover for a criminal conspiracy. At that point, things start escalating, and unless the owner of Molossia has been investing heavily in nuclear weapons, it won't end well for Molossia. Force is the coin of sovreignity, and (in the US at least) secession has been off the table since The Late Unpleasantness (1861 - 1865) If Molossia is, in fact, a sovereign nation, then what happens within its borders is (with a few exceptions as noted in other answers) the business of Molossia. So the question would be, does the Molossian judicial system care about the crime you committed, and do they have an extradition treaty with the US? If the answer to both is yes, then in general you are out of luck. After the Molossians invoke the treaty and demonstrate that they actually have a case against you, you will be arrested and turned over to them. No treaty, no extradition. If the Molossian government is down with your crime, there is not much that will happen to you. There are a few exceptions to this. Recently, a number of nations have rejected extradition requests from the US on the grounds that they are unwilling to have their citizens subjected to capital punishment (the requests were for capital cases). As a more extreme alternative, if your crime (although not murder) was sufficiently abhorrent to US sensibilities, it might constitute the straw that broke the camel's back, and provide a casus belli. No more Molossia, and you'd arguably wind up getting charged with something. Actually, with Molossia's existence legally moot, the crime victim would be an American citizen and you would be prosecuted under the relevant state or Federal statute. Although unlikely, it's possible in principle, and it's unlikely any sane micro-nation would refuse to start proceedings against you under the threat of obliteration. 

Assuming that there exists a prevailing wind direction, the mountain range will have very different climates depending on which side of the range you're on. The windward side will be extremely wet, while the leeward side very dry. The climate of Oregon and Washington states are illustrative, with the Cascade Range providing the relief. The western portions of the state are notoriously wet, while the eastern portions can be nearly desert. A useful model of what can be used for building would be Britain, a notoriously wet area. A traditional technique is wattle and daub for walls and thatch for roofs. Once the mixture (daub) dries it can be fairly resistant to splashing during rainfall, especially if whitewashed.
