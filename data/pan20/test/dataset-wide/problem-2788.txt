From an ordinary operational semantics, that I see you, or do not see you, does not change you, it changes me. My understanding of phenomenon X is an aspect of myself and does not affect the phenomenon, except to the extent I interfere with it in order to get the necessary information to make the understanding. Even then, whether the result is to understand, or not, is not relevant to the thing understood. So the definition is an aspect of the relation between the describer and the thing described, and does not properly belong to the object as an attribute. There is not a different 'me' each time someone else comes to understand me in a different way. 

If you want this question to have an answer, there is no point in waiting until Plantinga. It is already answered in Plato, with minor variations of the same answer given by Leibniz, Descartes, Kant, and several others. Evil is a misunderstanding -- reality is beyond your comprehension, and the things you see as evil are really just not the way you want them. If you truly trusted God, you would see beyond your petty concerns and realize that every evil event now ultimately causes an opportunity for greater good in the future. [By one rather standard reading of Job, Satan is one of the Elohim, something even greater than an Angel. He is the Adversary of Man, a part of God that simply does not share any of the specific goals of mankind that are not ultimate goals of God himself. But his overall interest is in some sense good. He is pushing the boundary in quality assurance of the soul.] From the POV of someone who would readily accept the argument, it seems that people just don't accept the logic because they don't like the tone. The problem with the answer is that it implies God's goodness has little or nothing to do with making you happy. And that is bad for the basic message of a lot of religious movements. People continue to try and rationalize these perspectives. Like prophesy and free will, or human nature and responsibility, the question is no longer about new answers, it is about fitting together the existing ones in ways that don't bother us. 

There is a rigid standard from Abstract Algebra, that might give this structure. The group known as Bourbaki proposes that the clearest way of communicating operations is postfix, and they propose some very rigid translations back into more normal forms from postfix. By applying their standards, we can get some ideas. The propose a preferred form and two alternatives for readability: 

Sorry, to give an answer anchored less in math or philosophy than in cognitive behavioral therapy. But in this case, it is the only relevant model that makes any sense in my opinion. First of all, subjective measures of probability are generally horrible, and Person A's are likely to be absolute nonsense. So this form of argument in terms of absolute probability is seldom meaningful. But let's put that aside and assume this is not just arrogance. Second, even a totally statistical application of the concept of risk is in terms of expected value, not mere probability. So you are leaving out the rate of return. People can very rationally choose a high risk for a high return. And the value of a return is always subjective, even when it is monetized (a single $1000 return means a lot to a broke person the day before rent is due, where a $2000 return five days later might have much lower value. Winning $5 off your worst enemy may be many times as satisfying as winning $500 off someone you have never met....) It is clearly fair for Person A to disagree with Person B's subjective sense of probability or rate-of-return, especially if there are objective factors driving them that are clearly not being taken into account by Person B. It is also possible that Person A can observe habits of thought in Person B that distort their sense of probability and subjective rates of return, and cause them to make decisions about risks that Person B themselves are likely to disagree with later. But in an absolute sense, no, Person A cannot know that Person B is being irrational. He never has all the facts necessary, because payoffs are complex to the point of being paradoxical, and probabilities are influenced by very subtle details. 

For institutions, this often happens due to a the form of fiduciary responsibility. If an institution represents a wide range of people with different ethical opinions, to choose one of them makes it not representative of the others. If it becomes less effective at its stated goals in a way that is not representative of all those participating, it is breaking the agreement that it do what is specified in good faith to its participants. The concept of a 'fiduciary' applies to all corporations with investors, for-profit, governmental and otherwise. This may not cover all of what you mean, but it is the case for most institutions, since those are most of the institutions. Corporations often also include the right to look at wider ethical concerns in the agreement that founds them. Then to ignore it would be counter-fiduciary. But that often makes them specifically uninteresting to a wide range of investors. In fact government agencies are generally not bound by this constraint. If a moral question is not religious, there is no reason it cannot be part of a law. Publicly-funded educational settings are often among those most free in our current culture to address moral issues directly. It is private firms with investors and public-serving groups with a stated charter that are not allowed to moralize with anonymous money or to choose one form of morality over another in a way that excludes or disadvantages potential participants with different agendas. For individuals, there is no such concept, and no such moral escape. There is just a habit of humans acting like corporations because we are used to assuming that life is business and this is he normal way to do business. 

It is ultimately not possible to really aim for evil. To a certain degree, evil is not a thing. It 'has no positive sense' meaning that the notions of 'good', 'absolute' and negation simply do not get along in this way. Evil is always a state of incompleteness, and never a cohesive whole entity, and so it cannot really be taken as an objective. This notion goes all the way back to Plato. At least on the surface, everyone is a consequentialist, and all aims pursue an end with some positive consequence. If you have decided to aim for a goal that some moral system prescribes as evil, there is some way, however minor, in which that action has positive value to you, however fleeting, otherwise, it would never occur to you. (The glee of destruction has some form of survival value, or it would never have evolved. Expressing a positive trait is, in itself, basically good.) The deontological system them imposes extra consequences. In addition to the main goal and its natural consequences, there are the additional, perhaps metaphysical, consequences of being a bad person in general. Their abstract nature does not prevent them from being consequences. That does not mean the end was toward evil, it means the agent failed to account for these consequences. By that logic, every evil act has some component of good to it, and your ultimate aim is never toward evil, it is simply in error. Even if you chose a moral framing that would allow you to purposively pursue evil, you are not logically capable of doing so. Beyond that one chooses a deontological system. And the basis of this choice is inevitably in tems of consequences: pursuing Kantianism satisfies a will toward fairness, consistency, and cohesion; pursuing Utilitarianism satisfies a wish for human beings to be happy; pursuing a virtue ethics or a satisfies a need to have clear, shared goals; pursuing a religious morality fulfills a need to serve God or gods. At that level again everyone is a consequentialist. The choice of rules is driven by some goal, which can only be captured in the consequences those rules will cause their adherents to create, in this world or the next. Whatever will the ethics pursues will be satisfied through actions, with a process and consequences, if only the need's own satisfaction. And no such ultimate goal can be evil, either, for the same reason no superficial wish really is. If you set out to be evil, that drive arises from something which itself is not evil, but is a dialectical antithesis to some deontological thesis, and thinking of it as evil is just a misunderstanding of how good is shaped and develops. In this way, Deontologism and Consequentialism are not opposed. Evil exists in the lack of understanding of a set of reasons why an act might have given consequences. Any usable ethics is made up of alternative layers of rules and analyses of their effects. They are not the same thing, but they are balancing dynamics that cannot really be separated. 

It seems obvious that if university research created true statements, it would be done already. All kinds of study are by nature an endless succession of refinements, divergences and reversals. For the sciences this is best captured by Popper's notion that a scientific theory only has value to the degree that it risks being wrong. Other disciplines all have some part of that same character. Repeating what is already certain is the thing academics have to do rather little of, or we would need very many fewer academics of all sorts. 

I think that rather than Rationality, what you are after is Rationalism. It is quite easy to be quite rational without being rationalistic. Rationalistic metaphysics tries to motivate all understanding, or at least as large a part as is in any way possible entirely from intuition and logic, and to rely upon experience as little as possible. There are in fact a wide range of deeply rationalistic forms of metaphysics, and it may constitute a majority of the subject historically. So yes, you will find it there. Such metaphysics generally automatically assume human rational psychology is simply correct, so they tend to favor concepts like God, and the value of autonomy and self-respect, which seem to come naturally to humans, even if they end up not fitting into experience very well. (If we turn starkly toward experience, we become used to the notion of cause and effect, which tends to make us feel mechanical and unfavored, and often not really autonomous, or acquainted with God.) If a pointer toward these systems is in fact what you are asking, I would suggest that idealists such as Spinoza or Berkely are the most basic examples of deeply rationalistic philosophies, but I would say the best example is Kant, who works very hard at accommodating our ability to learn from experience while refusing to allow encountered reality to ever contravene rationalism.
