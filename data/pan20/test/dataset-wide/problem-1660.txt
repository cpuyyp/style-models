Partial answer regarding whether Office 39 exists and finances nuclear program. No doubt Office 39 does indeed exist. Followind Executive Order 13551 US Treasury has frozen their funds a year ago. 

No, there is no evidence to support "a setup". There where two independent official investigations, one by Interstate Aviation Committee (IAC; Russian: Межгосударственный авиационный комитет, МАК), one by Polish Ministry of Defense's Committee for Investigation of National Aviation Accidents (Polish: Komisja Badania Wypadków Lotniczych Lotnictwa Państwowego; KBWLLP). Also participating in IAC's investigation were numerous accredited experts from Poland, and in some parts of investigation, regarding US made avionics, included two experts from US (one from FAA and one from NTSB). While reports differed slightly on who's more to blame, both concluded that causes where thick fog, pilot errors, ill prepared airfield and errors in communication between control tower and pilot. Two big points of discrepancy are: 

Another thing that speaks against the radiation, is the fact, that the drop in life expectancy does not correlate with the fallout. 

On his Facebook page he's got invitation to exposition of airplane photos, one of which is described as: 

TL;DR This is almost certainly true The US department of Census reports in 2010 there were 35,218,000 households with "own children under 18 years" (This probably excludes some households with children, such as those being raised by someone other than the parents). This is out of a total number of households of 117,538,000. Dog statistics are a little harder to get accurate, but The Humane Society says 39% of US households own at least one dog. That would give a number of dog-owning households at 45,839,000 - substantially more than the number of households with children. Other sources have similar figures. It's probably worth mentioning that the number of households who have ever had children is more than the number who have children now. 

"By one count" is one of those phrases articles use when they really aren't very sure about the provenance and accuracy of the figure. That's not to say the figure has no value at all. But it shouldn't be taken as an accurate figure, and certainly not be as frequently quoted on the web as it appears to be. The quote is certainly nothing to do with the 700 signatories on the Discovery Institute's widely criticised "Dissent from Darwin list. The quote is from 1987 and the Dissent from Darwin list started in 2001. 

This is just a case of total misunderstanding of terms. Original claim was that Apple has more cash, than operating balance of US federal government. Operating balance means revenues minus liabilities. 

Obviously all calculations based on inverse square law (i.e. strength of a signal is inversely proportional to the square of distance) is proof enough. But I'd like to remind you of few more factors: 

Now, if you would go international and compare it with the other side of the English Channel: France is republic since 1789. Yet Louvre, former royal palace, is the most visited museum in the world with 8.5 million visits in 2009, which is 20 times more than Buckingham Palace. 

Today New America Foundation has published a report "The Cost of Connectivity 2013: A comparison of high-speed Internet prices in 24 cities around the world" It has been covered by media, mostly in a tone that US is lagging behind and lacking choices (emphasis mine): 

Yes, it can, just as much as reading or any other activity where you're looking at something close to your eyes. "Optometric Clinical Practice Guidline: Care Of The Patient With Myopia": 

The statement provides only two reasonable measure of 'quality of life' - availability of primary school places, and number of doctors per person. The percentage of children in primary school has remained constant from 1990 to now, since attendance at primary schools is compulsory, and local authorities are mandated to provide them. The number of children not in primary school is limited to those who are illegally prevented from attending by their parents, and the very few who are actually in transition between schools. The number of physicians per thousand persons in the UK was 1.6 in 1990. In 2014 it was 2.8, an increase of 75%. Conclusion: The statement is entirely false according to any measurable quantity. 

While it is possible that the ABC poll mentioned may have had flaws, ABC is an experienced polling organization. It is unlikely that it has made an error of tens of percents in the estimates. The given percentage is 61, with a margin of error of about 3%. This is in line with other polls. This one gives 54% as the number who believe in a six-day creation. This one gives 55%. This one says 40%. This one says 66%. So while the precise figure is hard to determine, and probably depends on the question, is is clearly true that something in the region of half of Americans believe in the literal truth of Genesis. And by implication Noah's Ark. 

Note however, that above map refers to natural blond, while stereotype does not make that distinction. 

After this has leaked to the press, disciplinary action was taken, not for illegal quotas, but rather for "obscenity during official briefings". 

Increasing off-label use of antipsychotic medications in the United States, 1995–2008, Pharmacoepidemiology and Drug Safety Volume 20, Issue 2, pages 177–184, February 2011 

... and the list goes on and on. This is just one small part of central Africa. Another extremely poor region is Somalia. Currently the most violent region in the world. It's at constant civil war since 1991, with numerous belligerents. Currently coalition of these loyal to government fighting against coalition of Islamist insurgents. UN tried to intervene there in 1992, which led to US military fiasco known as Battle of Mogadishu in 1993 (later depicted in a movie). Whole UN intervention proved to be a fiasco and was terminated in 1995. The cost on US side was estimated to be $7bn ($11.2bn inflation adjusted), and has allegedl saved lives of 10,000 Somalis. Which gives cost of $700,000 ($1,120,000 inflation adjusted) per Somali allegedly saved (source). Afghanistan is another of the poorest regions in the world. The cost of US intervention in Afghanistan alone already exceeds $550bn. Overall, to solve problem of poverty in Africa, you'd need military peacekeeping action on unprecedented scale. As previous attempts in Somalia show, it's neither cheap nor easy. As runaway costs of Iraq and Afghanistan wars show, the military costs can easily reach trillions of dollars. And that's not even starting to count the humanitarian help, the restoration of infrastructure, education etc. And besides all that, the author of the article mentioned as source of the claim, suggest getting the money from... reduced military spending. Update, to answer Oddthinking's question from comments. Sachs proposal (source) is as follows: 

That would give a month's weight of food as around 38kg. That's less than the average weight of a person, by a factor of around 2. I would expect an average British person to be eating significantly more than the average for people worldwide. They could be eating less than the average for the US, but I doubt it is by a factor of 2. So no the claim is not strictly true. But an error by a factor of two is actually pretty good for a web comic, and might be just a case of artistic license 

This book questions the addictive properties of nicotine, but even it admits: "Nicotine is almost universally believed to be the major factor that motivates smoking and impedes cessation.". While I don't have access to the book, it seems likely that the author believes that some other ingredient of cigarettes causes addiction rather than cigarettes not being addictive. So the huge majority of informed opinion says Yes, cigarettes are addictive. It may be that a few people dissent from that view. 

TL:DR Most studies find figures ten times lower than this one. The "80 times more often" figure comes from a single study: "Kleck and Gertz:Armed resistance to crime: The prevalence and nature of self defense with a gun. Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology 1995 (Fall); 86:150–187", in which the authors estimated that there were 2.5 million occasions per year in which a gun was used in self-defense. Here is a brief summary of the methodology: 

Thus, with constant pressure, warm carbonated drink will go "flat" much sooner than cooled one. In case of sealed bottle, effect is much lesser, because solubility increases with pressure. Leaving your sealed soda bottle warm will build up pressure with CO2 escaping the water, preventing more gas from escaping the solution. This is described by Henry's law. 

There are mixed claims in the question, "lack of sunshine" does not mean "above average rainfall" nor "more rainy days". It means more days with significant cloud coverage (some of which may be rainy). As you can see on below map, insolation (average sunshine energy received) of UK is significantly lower than rest of Europe. 

Not really. Total estimate US spending for Y2K $134bn in preparation + $13bn for fixing problems in first few months of 2000. That's $147bn total, which inflation adjusted to 2011 is $200bn. By contrast, total estimated US healthcare IT spending is $40bn, and only fraction of that can be attributed to IDC-10 migration. 

The conclusion comes from research published in Mapfre's trade journal Seguridad y Medio Ambiente (Security and Environment). "Personal risks posed by LEDs used in everyday devices" 

Starting with two sexually mature rats (and assuming averages of all the above throughout), the original pair will produce 7 litters of 8 rats in a year - 56 rats. The first litter in the second generation become fertile at 4 months after birth (5 months from the start of the year), and so the four females in that litter will have around 7/12*7 = 4 litters each in the year - 128 rats. 128 + 56 = 184. That's so close to the 200 that we don't need to worry about the remaining 6 litters or further generations. Rats are clearly capable of becoming at least 200 within a year. 

It also lacks any explanation of how the alleged radiation could have caused these deaths. The usual statement has to be made about all such allegations:"correlation is not causation". The Canadian article is just a rant with no information. It doesn't even state whether the infant death rate went up before or after the Fukushima tragedy (which took place halfway through the period that article claims to have figures for). Against this is the truth that the amounts of radiation which reached the US (and Canada) were absolutely trivial. Here is an article giving some information: initial readings are "about a billion times beneath levels that would be health threatening." People who don't understand radiation often assume that "any radiation causes disease", forgetting that we are all subjected to much more radiation than reached North America from Japan just from natural sources.

Another argument, would be that the Earth is in a constant movement. It's spinning around it's axis at 360°/24h, which means that Earth spins 7° during one episode of "I Love Lucy". Also Earth travels around the Sun at angle velocity of 360°/365¼d. Note, that few degrees off might not seem much, but at a distance of 55 light years 1° off translates into 1 light year off. 

Yes and No According to numerous studies some of more visible prices go up significantly, however overall the price increase is very limited. OECD paper analyzing the subject few months before Slovakia switched to Euro and predicting what effect it could have on Slovak economy: 

Google will find any others you are looking for. You might like to read a few to get a feel for how Are there any meaningful figures on this subject? Not as far as I can tell. This table is closely related in that it gives pilot error-induced accidents as a proportion of all accidents. I'm going to guess that the "pilot error (weather related)" and "pilot error (mechanical related)" might be cases where pilots reacted wrongly to a bad but not necessarily fatal situation. Are there some examples? Even a fairly brief reading of these accidents will reveal cases where the aircrew did not follow their proper training even under normal circumstances - they show up in the accident reports because their actions caused an accident. Is the question a useful one? From your tone you seem to be asking whether Cpt Sully and his crew deserve to be called heroes, or if they just did their job. Why are the two contradictory? If we think about firefighters, police, soldiers, coastguard rescue, they are trained exactly to respond to extreme situations, and it's what we expect of them; that shouldn't stop us from calling them heroes when they do it. Nobody should be dragged from a burning building and say to the firefighter who did it:"Hey, you were just doing your job". Civilian aircrew aren't quite in the same category - most pilots never go through a situation half as extreme as this for real. But if they correctly respond to an emergency as they were trained, under extreme pressure and when every human instinct is to cover your eyes and scream, they deserve all the hero-credit they can get. 

On-line storage If you're going to build something as big as NSA datacenter, instead of buying readily available hardware, you might go for custom builds using big data industry standards. Facebook's Open Compute Storage specifies Open Vault storage, which is designed to house 30 3.5" HDDs in 2U case. Which with currently available HDDs would mean density of 120TB per 2U. You can put 21 of these in one standard 42U high 19" rack, meaning you'd have 2520TB per rack. Each rack having a base of about 0.62m². Adding some very minimum clearance, 1m² per rack would be the very lowball estimate. That's assuming that you'd be willing to have machines custom build for your datacenter. Otherwise it's off the shelf hardware. For example Dell PowerVault MD1200 configured with 12 4TB SATA drives costs $11,254.21; That of course is retail price, which bulk orders you get hefty discounts. Similarly, you could get a cloud server such as PowerEdge C6145, which can also be equipped with 12 4TB SATA drives. They don't provide they pricing on-line, but if I remember correctly, that kind of setup it'd be around $15-20K. Both of above give you density of 48TB per 2U. Which means 1004TB per rack. NSA Utah datacenter is reported to have 10,000m² dedicated to servers (100,000m² including administrative and support buildings). So really, really high ball estimate would be that they could theoretically squeeze 25EB of cloud storage in there. That's only 0.5% of 5ZB. Off-line storage If you're considering offline archiving of data, you might use tape libraries. It's not typically used in Big Data, but then again, NSA isn't typical Big Data company. Problem is, that even with highest density IBM System Storage TS3500 Tape Library, you can store 180PB per library, which has footprint of at least 15m². Which means about 420,000m² would be needed just for the tape libraries. Whole NSA Utah complex is estimated to have "1 million or 1.5 million square feet" (93,000m²-149,000m²), but it's also been said that it's "100,000 square feet (9,300m²) of data center space and greater than 900,000 square feet (83,600m²) of technical support and administrative space" (source). Purpose of the buildings might be kept secret or intentionally misleading, external dimensions cannot. So clearly there is no way to squeeze 5ZB of tape archive there, even if buildings said to be administrative are actually purposed for tape archive. Meta-data So let's assume that even if you'd manage to somehow archive 5ZB of raw data, as I've calculated above even if you'd use all your datacenter space for on-line processing, that would mean you're storing only 5KB of metadata for each 1MB of data. While for media files that seems more than enough, I really doubt you can achieve ratio anywhere near that for emails, chats, text messages, tweets etc. Of course they might filter out information they've not interested in and not store any metadata related to that information. But in that case there is no point in archiving that information off-line, because you don't have path of access — you don't have metadata pointing to it, nor can you mine the data that is archived on tapes. Throughput Assuming that it's 5ZB per year, that's a sustained throughput of 570PB per day, or 160TB per second. Leaving apart computing power needed to process that, question is how that data would be transported there? Current internet infrastructure isn't anywhere nearly ready for that kind of traffic. Three of the biggest internet exchange points are located in Europe having maximum throughput of 2.2TBps, 2.1TBps and 1.6TBps respectively. US is trailing way behind with top US only exchanges having only 0.28TBps and 0.25TBps, another one, Equinix has total of 1.4TBps across 12 countries on 4 continents. In other words it's completely infeasible to push 5ZB per year into a datacenter, especially in such a remote location. Nor, as you can see, necessary, even if you'd want to process all of Internet traffic. Conclusion
