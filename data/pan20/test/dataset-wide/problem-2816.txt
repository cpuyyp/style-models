I'm not so sure about cannabis specifically, but psychedelics in general played a role in the early development of many cultures, where shamans went into psychedelic trances to receive "divine inspiration". Some, like 20th century shaman Terrence McKenna, believe that getting stoned is actually the way we humans seperated ourselves from apes during our early development. Today, traditional forms of shamanism are still practices by specific cultures on every continent. Examples of psychedelics used in such traditional contexts include peyote, psilocybin mushrooms, uncured tobacco, cannabis, ayahuasca, Salvia divinorum, Tabernanthe iboga, Ipomoea tricolor and Amanita muscaria. During the 1960s, Timothy Leary popularized the used of psychedelics outside traditional shamanic contexts. Since the bloom of the 1960s counterculture, substances like cannabis, LSD, mescaline and many others have become widely used among philosophers, artists, scientists, engineers and entrepreneurs, in spite of their usual illegal status. For example, Albert Hofmann took LSD together with Ernst Jünger. Neuroscientist John Lilly was an avid LSD user, and he introduced it to Richard Feynman. Steve Jobs took LSD up to 15 times from 1972 to 1974, according to official statements. Aldous Huxley took both mescaline & LSD, and described both experiences in respectively "The Doors of Perception" and "Heaven and Hell". Microdosing LSD on the job has been common among Silicon Valley software engineers. Among Cambridge researchers, the microdosing of LSD been common as well, according to a 2004 interview with Francis Crick. Being far less potent than LSD or mescaline, cannabis is used much more widely and it's use in a recreational context has become about as mainstream as the recreational use of alcohol among millennials in many countries. What a psychedelic (any psychedelic, including cannabis) does to the mind, is opening it up. It breaks down a person's preconceived ideas and allows ideas to enter the mind that were inconceivable to that same mind before. For example, it allows a religious person to take a less biased look at Atheism but also allows an Atheist to take a less biased look at religion. Or it allows a racist to see other races without prejudice, but also allows an anti-racist to see a racist without prejudice. So, psychedelics break down not just the barriers in our own perception, but also the ones that prevent us from looking at each other as equals. How exactly this impacted philosophy, science, engineering or art as a whole, is very hard to estimate. This is particularly difficult since most of these substances are illegal and therefore few people address their use of such substances in public discourse. Nevertheless, it's undeniable that they played a significant role in the development of the relativist perspectives on reality like those we find in existentialism and postmodernism. Because, really, if there's one common theme throughout psychedelic experiences, it's the notion that literally everything is relative and that the universe is ironic at its very core. The following text, desribes the core principles of Discordianism, which is a semi-serious semi-parody take on religion, that was clearly fueled by LSD when it was penned down in 1963 and that perfectly illustrates what I mean be the notion that everything is relative and that the universe is ironic : 

Mathematics is best described as the "study of topics such as quantity, structure, space, and change". While certain subsets of mathematics meet all the criteria for a language, the entire field of mathematics transcends it and we would be oversimplifying things by arguing that mathematics as a whole is a language. In spite of all its elegance and refinement, any scientific model built on top of mathematics will always remain "just" a model... which means that any such model will always represent "just" an approximation of the actual behavior of the universe itself. One can argue, however, that natural languages are not dissimilar in them being incapable of consistently and unambiguously describing every human thought or emotion. In light of phenomena like emergence, the notion of the universe as a "computer program" written in a "mathematical language" does not imply a "programmer" per se. 

While everything within our universe is deterministic and thus also our very thoughts and actions, our individual awareness is limited in its capacity to predict the outcome of our behavior. We imagine free will because it's very hard to comprehend our place within the universe if our every action is purely deterministic, even though that appears to be the case. University of Texas philosophy professor David Sosa tackles the problem of free will in a deterministic universe in this video, pointing out that integrating determinism with free will as philosophical concepts remains a problem to this day. Dan Dennett points out why our lives shouldn't be impacted by the answer to the question whether or not free will is illusionary. 

Philosophical movements, political movements & artistic movements tend to go hand in hand and follow the same swing of the meta-cultural pendulum between emotion-driven and reason-driven, and between hope and despair. I'm not sure what you refer to as "fin de siècle moments", but the late 19th and early 20th century were generally marked by culture pessimism. In art, this translated to eg. the Romanticist movement that longed back with nostalgia to the pre-Industrial age and of which Edgar Allen Poe is one of the most famous representatives. In the political arena, explicitly anti-modernist political movements like the conservative revolutionary movement had spawned along with various flavors of Ludditism. Meanwhile, sociologists like Oswald Spengler, Lothrop Stoddard and Max Nordau had made their mark arguing that Western civilization was accelerating towards impending doom, the traditionalist school made an effort to revive lost wisdom and the existentialist school of philosophers had come to the conclusion that the universe is inherently absurd and meaningless. All these movements are correlated in the sense that they all share a same sense of emptiness, which is typically attributed to the industrialization and consumerization of society around the end of the 19th century! 

Reason is a conscious process, that may or may not take emotions into account (albeit at a conscious level). Some would argue that reason is higher than faith and that a great capacity for reason eliminates the need for faith : 

Atheistic naturalists like Sam Harris consider science to be a more reliable, more testable equivament of philosophy, effectively making traditional philosophy rather obselete. Others, who reject Atheistic naturalism, typically argue either that... 

What is "insanity"? What is "mental illness"? In his 1961 work "The Myth of Mental Illness", Thomas Szasz famously argued that what is commonly qualified as "mental illness" is merely a deviation from societal norms. Szasz argued that "mental illness" is a metaphor and not a genuine disease, that it is merely a way of dealing with problematic people in society. “Psychiatry is conventionally defined as a medical specialty concerned with the diagnosis and treatment of mental diseases,” he wrote. “I submit that this definition, which is still widely accepted, places psychiatry in the company of alchemy and astrology and commits it to the category of pseudoscience. The reason for this is that there is no such thing as ‘mental illness.’” Recent works like Paris Williams’s 2012 publication Rethinking Madness and Wouter Kusters’s 2014 Philosophy of Madness reiterate this notion. They regard "psychosis" not as a form of "mental illness", but as a variation from the norm that comes with both positive and negative symptoms. Others have made similar arguments with respect to Autism, ADHD, Dyslexia, etc. In fact, psychosis, Autism, ADHD, Dyslexia and many other variations typically perceived as "defects" all commonly co-occur with high intelligence and creativity. Many (if not most) of the world's greatest scientists, artists and entrepreneurs are known to walk or have walked the thin line between "genius" and "madness". So what is the role of "insanity" in society? Maybe those perceived are "insane" or "mentally ill" are just more extreme variations within normal human neurodiversity, who are far more sensitive to context / environment than the average human, but who often also can become capable of the extraordinary under the right circumstances. To quote Bruce Feirstein : 

Note the word "necessity" at the end. In a modern scientific context, Occam's razor is the notion that we should look for the simplest explanation that is consistent with the empirical data. The more empirical data we have to consider, the less explanations remain that are consistent with all data, and the less simple the remaining explanations tend to be. Basically, you can think of Occam's razor as scientists (1) compiling lists of possible explanations, (2) cross-referencing the explanations with the empirical data available to them, (3) eliminating all explanations that are inconsistent that data and (4) ending up with the simplest explanation they haven't eliminated. Of course, that process never ends since new findings are constantly published, which is why scientific theories are replaced by other (more complex) theories all the time. That is how one can start with a very simple explanation and end up with very complex scientific theories, all while applying occam's razor rigorously. 

The opponents of Atheistic naturalism therefore argue that philosophy remains necessary to co-exist as a framework alongside science to answer those (usually moral) questions they believe science can never answer. In my experience, whether people answer your question with a "yes" or a "no" will depend on whether they are proponents or opponents of Atheistic naturalism. 

While some of these questions can be addressed by neuroscience, others need to be addressed by biology, physics, mathematics or other fields of science. While I would argue that philosophy has been rendered obselete by the scientific method as way to answer these questions and that any philosophical question can not only be addressed by science but that scientific answers will be the most reliable answers, it is not neuroscience that supersedes philosophy but rather an integrated scientific model based on the integrated data and theories from all sciences combined. So no single scientific field can replace philosophy, but science as a whole can replace it and IMO should replace it. What about ethics? Science both teach us a lot about how our actions influence our happiness and stability. Herein, neuropsychology typically focuses on individual behavior, whereas sociology focuses on the collective components components and biology focuses on genetic components of our behavior. Combined, neuropsychology, sociology and biology give a rather complete picture of human behavior and human consciousness. It allows us to model human nature in a consistent way, which in turn allows us to develop a rational moral foundation based this model. Adding to that, mathematical studies like game theory can help us determine the impact of our actions and assess that impact with greater clarity.
