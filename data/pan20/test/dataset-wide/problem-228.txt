Right. So given you want a mechanical solution, let's see what this twisted mind of mine comes up with. 

Given you tagged this as a 'vampire' question, I'll assume you're a friend of mine and we're chatting over tea ^_^ (actual tea, not blood in a teacup) You have to consider what the vampire is drinking the blood for. Yes, TrEs-2b is right on the medical facts (I didn't fact check, but it sounds about right). However, this isn't just about the medical, this is about the mythos of the vampires you're talking about. Now, seeing as our vampires are different I will assume you are going to change certain things to make them make sense for what you want them to represent. If it's a magical thing, and they are 'feeding' off people for (insert reason here), then you'll want them to be alive as they feed. If you want them to show you the 'lawyer stereotype', where "they'll still screw you after you're dead", then go with the medical maximum (TrEs suggests about half an hour, but keep it shorter because you don't want 'oops moments'). Or if they are meant to represent an undying link to the past, then it really doesn't matter -- you can have them drink week old, dried blood, just give them some kind of handwavium to make the blood 'fresh from the vein'. Because it's about their preservation, not about the blood itself. The point is, you need to focus on what your vampires represent, not what their limitations are. Yes, you need to know the medical/scientific limitations, but limitations can be worked around. Not only because this is the evolutionary concept, but because this is your creation. 

There is so much to unpack in the original question. So much historical, psychological, and socio-economical baggage. So let's begin. Historically, kings that reigned with an iron fist--surprise, surprise--were detested. So there are plenty of history and legends passed down regarding the uprisings that were inevitable to rise. Robin Hood is just such a figure, though I'm sure he needs no introduction. Another such figure that we've all indirectly heard of, is Nebuchadnezzar II, though most will remember the name as the ship Morpheus was captain of in The Matrix Trilogy. I find this one far more interesting, because of the legacy ol' Nebuchadnezzar left behind. Whether true or slander spread by those he conquered (given the majority I've learned about him is from the Old Testament in the Bible), he is reputed to have suffered from Clinical Lycanthropy or Porphyria (both of which are discussed on the link to Nebuchadnezzar). Bear in mind, however, that all kings are cruel in the 'good ol' days', it's just that beloved kings were cruel to their kingdom's enemies. (this is important for public relations efforts for the king) Psychologically, you offer something that can be taken many ways. 

Having said that, I would be exceedingly careful with those rules in mazes. Again, in a labyrinth, you only have forwards and back on a twisting and turning path. You have no choices. Let's be clear here. This is a labyrinth: 

Actually, there are plenty of just such examples. Though it's only used as weaponry, and typically more in games. (that's a jab at the other plausible uses I could dream up) So. Examples: 

(notice multiple paths, even if this is a simplified version) Now that we're on the same page with this (and please don't try to dictionary.com me, because I'm talking about historical and mathematical fact). Is there a conceivable way that touching an outer wall will lead you to getting lost? Let's start with known algorithms. In the link, it describes ways your wall-follower rule don't always work. 

I myself have a strange kind of love for lagomorphs, so this is something I've considered quite a bit. I have several possible paths they could take to change their niche. Keep in mind that this isn't based purely on a logical standpoint, there could be some handwavium involved, and not everything is the 'logical conclusion'. These are thoughts from my own ponderings for fantasy settings. Path to defence--a la porcupine. The hairs on their backs start to get harder, pointier. Their diets would have to change accordingly--seeing as they'd need far more protein and whatnot to accommodate the changes. All you'd have to do is compare what evolutionary pressure caused the porcupine to develop as they did. Path to offence--a la predator. Humans were, at one point, herbivores. Evolutionary benefits were afforded by digesting meats--a far more potent source of calories. Rabbits might take a similar route. It could start as growing more prominent claws, perhaps canines as well. With their numbers, rabbits could become the most dangerous pack predator out there. Path to intelligence--a la homo sapiens. Though it is still debatable why humans developed sapience, there is little doubt random mutations and evolutionary pressure were key factors in it. Is it so hard to believe lagomorphs are capable of similar jumps? Perhaps it's via a mutation that grows opposable thumbs. Perhaps it's a mutation in the brain that allows for more complex thought-precesses. Intelligence--the ability to adapt to changing environmental conditions--are how we survived as a species. So apply those rules to lagomorphs. They are already social creatures, so add planning, trap-making, perhaps rudimentary societies as they carve out their own history and stories. 

Why not the cleaner? Why does it have to be an intern? I could simply be that a well-meaning cleaner happens to be on somewhat friendly terms with someone that works the theory behind it. They could see that this person is under stress, and offers a listening ear and some freshly brewed coffee. You could even throw in an Einstein quote, given he was quite close to someone with a mental disability, though I forget of which nature. 

The glider option isn't impossible, but you're over complicating it. Your army is on open plains, but you are also looking at a literal army that needs to storm the gates. Getting everyone a glider is expensive. Getting all of them up in the air is nearly impossible. You need to take into account that some will have a fear of heights, or will be nervous and butterfinger-y, which could lead to them literally falling out of the sky. Given the era, safety regulations will be unheard of, so people will die on the climb regardless. So get into the meat of the theory behind gliders, set them upwind, and have them armed with crossbows with rope to make sure they can get into the city. This method guarantees heavy casualties, because it sounds like this city is heavily fortified. A castle-like structure. Heavy losses on the attackers' side is all but guaranteed, so it might be written off as acceptable losses. Still, the glider thing feels stilted, at best. Why not go for the undercover route? I mean, this place is hovering, why not just use ballistas to attach ropes to the underbelly of the city and have your people dig up until they're in? You could have them attach the ropes in the dead of night, to ensure they aren't under constant arrow-fire. But this route assumes it's doable--very dependent on there being no handwavium or super dense adamantine flooring. I've considered the balloon thing, but that's a slaughter waiting to happen. I mean, if the defenders have ballistas or bows and a plethora of arrows? Balloons aren't the most defensible places to stage an attack. What the attackers could do is have a portion of their army up in balloons with either ballistas or crossbow, or whatever, and rain down cover-fire on the defenders while their compatriots are scaling the walls. But this means knowing well in advance what the winds will be like, and so much hair-thin precision planning that it would take a genius (or plot armour) for it to work. It's not impossible, though. And if you have a character that's already shown themselves the tactician, this is the better route. Still, much room for error, and that isn't always something you want. And that's ignoring the ginormous material costs to this approach. Sieges are about starving the enemy. You know they cannot leave without your notice, and they are essentially trapped. So make them miserable. It's boring as all hell, but why not smoke them out? I mean, you're in a plains. That means the wind is typically predictable, so you can plan for where the fire needs to be lit. There won't be any air purifiers on the defenders' side, and this would essentially kill them slowly (though less slowly than starvation). If you have a chemist on hand, or a woodsman, they might know of local flora that might add a poisonous substance to the smoke cloud. Then all you need to do is wait the little bastards out. If taking this place is imperative, and you need to keep the place intact, then you need to get creative. Look at the people in the attacking army. Who has the skills needed to get this job done. Are there any that were once of the rogue-archtype? A thief, a pickpocket. Something, anything. These types tend to know how to get around in small groups. Get them what they need--a long rope to climb up, that glider to swoop in, parachutes made of silk to paratrooper their way in. Get them in and let them raise hell among the enemy troops. Start fires in the enemy food stores. Spread rumours about a black magician, or a necromancer that will raise their corpses to ravage their loved ones.
